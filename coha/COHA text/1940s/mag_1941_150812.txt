" No fightin ' in August ! " That 's what Joe Louis told Promoter Mike Jacobs last winter when his fight-a-month campaign was first laid out . Reason : August is the climax of the Negro golf season . And the world 's greatest fisticuffer , in the four years he has worn the crown , has become more &; more bored with his profession , more &; more enthusiastic about golf . <P> Last week , at Detroit 's Rackham ( municipal ) Golf Course , the Brown Bomber was host to 186 of the best Negro golfers in the U.S. , professional and amateur . They had been invited to compete in the newest tournament on the colored calendar , the Joe Louis Open . The Champion had sponsored sport ventures before . He sank $30,000 in the maintenance of the Brown Bombers , a nomadic is no small shucks . Sandwiched between the Negro National Amateur Open , Joe 's tournament , with annual prize money of $1,000 , will be a blue-ribbon golf event , tantamount to the white folks ' tournament sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gene Tunney but the Bobby Jones of his race . He has done more than any other person to popularize golf among Negroes . But on the fairway , Joe is no Jones . Aided by his mighty right , he can sock a ball nearly 300 yards . " But , " he moans , " I have trouble with my left hook and just ai n't got that delicate touch around the greens . " Still , under the private instruction of Bermudian Pro Louis Corbin and Washingtonian Clyde Martin , his present tutor , Louis has become a better than average golfer , has often chalked up scores in the middle 70s . Last fortnight , in the National Negro Amateur , he shot 79 in the opening round . <P> Last week , however , playing in his own tournament before a gallery of 1,000 or more ( 25% white ) , the Champion got the heebie-jeebies , posted 88 in the first round , 81 in the second , quit after nine holes of the third . On the other side of the ropes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Tutor Martin shot 146 ( 72-74 ) in the 36-hole final . Martin 's 72-hole total of 292 , two strokes better than that of Atlantans Calvin Searles and Zeke Hartsfield , won the tournament and the $500 first prize . Lowest amateur score was 300 , turned in by a 19-year-old Norfolk kid named Leroy Smith . <P> Undaunted , Louis plans to match strokes with the big shots once more : in the coveted Negro Open to be played on the Ponkapoag course in Canton , Mass , this week . " Some day , " he drawled , " I 'll be the golf champ . "
