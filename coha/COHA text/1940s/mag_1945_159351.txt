When the statesmen gathered at Potsdam last July to settle the future of Germany , the sky was blue , the land was bright under a warm summer sun . Last week , powdery snow whirled down into Berlin 's pocked streets , and onto Berlin 's Grunewald , where the trees had been cut down for firewood and even the stumps were now being pulled out . Thousands of shivering , tired Germans lugged their bundles of wood to cold , bombed houses . Hospitals were crowded . Because the patients were undernourished , many died . <P> The living cursed the " Potsdam Peace . " <P> A Relative Matter . Yet Germany 's plight had been caused primarily not by the peace the world had imposed on Germany , but by the war Germany had imposed on the world . Not Germans alone , but most Europeans , were cold and hungry this postwar winter . Nevertheless , there was much talk that Germans would starve . The talk centered about three different ( and often confused ) living standards set up for Germany : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to live better than the average European . Some Americans who knew prewar Germany were shocked when they began to realize how great a drop that was . Germany ( despite her self-advertised status as a " have-not " nation ) had lived far better than other Continental nations . Even now Germans returning from Poland and The Netherlands told their countrymen that they had no cause to grumble . <P> The official U.S.-prescribed minimum level of German diet ( estimated at 1,550 calories per German per day ) , calculated to be just high enough to prevent " disease and unrest . " <P> The diet ( estimated at 1,350 calories ) that Germans were actually getting this month under the U.S. ration system . Through black markets and hoarding , many Germans were getting more . But as the winter wore on , many might be getting less . <P> Walls of Suspicion . It was difficult to maintain even the lowest of these levels , partly because four-power rule in Germany did not work . Though Potsdam had called for treatment of Germany as an economic unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually no trade between them . <P> At recent meetings of the Control Council , zonal government showed at its worst . Marshal Georgi Zhukov calmly declared that while he really trusted the British , he could not understand the presence in the British zone of entire German Wehrmacht units under German officers . Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery retorted testily that Zhukov 's facts were inaccurate . The question was shelved , leaving a bad taste all around . <P> The Hard Choice . Meanwhile , food stocks were growing slimmer . From Washington came encouragement : the U.S. would send food to Germany . Moreover , Washington had come around to the view that the U.S. would have to pay its own occupation costs rather than charge them to the bankrupt Germans . The U.S. preferred to add enormously to its bill for World War II in order to achieve one of the war 's objectives : the permanent disarmament of Germany . Insistence on cash or goods from Germany would mean restoring her heavy industry and , with it , her war potential . Washington was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans and rebuilding the Reich .
