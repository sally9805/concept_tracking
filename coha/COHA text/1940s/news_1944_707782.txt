txt Baruch Gives $1,100,000 For Research in Medicine In a move dictated largely by the faith of his father  --  a doctor ? in the worth of physical medicine and his own deep desire to help rehabilitate the sick and wounded war veterans , Bernard M. Baruch , financier , philanthropist and key figure on the American home front in two World Wars , made yesterday a gift of $1,100 , - 000 to advance teaching and research in that field . Firm in the- belief that physical medicine  --  which involves the diagnosis and treatment of disease by such external physical agents as light , water , heat , electricity , exercise and massage  --  has not received the scientific treatmenta deserves , Mr. Baruch. has evolved a program that will bring Columbia University 's College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York University 's College of Medicine and the Medical College of Virginia into active collaboration . In announcing the gift at his office at 597 Madison Avenue , Mr. Baruch , who at 73 stands 6 feet 3 inches tall and is still as straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only an initial one if the program develops as he hopes . " If it works out all right , I propose that practically all of my fortune will go into it , " he said . " But it has got to turn out right . I do n't like to waste money . " This last remark , practical as it was , produced smiles on the faces of reporters present , for Mr. Baruch is known for the variety and substantial proportions of his contributions to worthy causes . On Dec. 23 , 1942 , he gave $1,000,000 in war bonds as a Christmas gift to Army and Navy Relief , the fighting men of the United Nations and representative refugee organizations . The present gift was made only after he had induced a group of ; outstanding medical men to make a thorough scientific exploration of the possibilities of physical medicine . Their report won the immediate praise of ranking medi // cal men of the Army and Navy , who attested to the need for wide and rapid development in the field and pledged support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeon General of the Navy , expressed himself " in complete accord with the principle and recommendation " of the report and said the plan for increasing the number of teachers was " highly desirable . " Maj. Gen. Norman T. Kirk , Surgeon General of the Army , said his branch of the services was " vitally concerned with any new scientific enlightenment in this field , especially as it pertains to reconditioning of wounded soldiers and sailors . " Other endorsements came from Maj. Gen. David N. W. Grant , Air Surgeon of the Army , and Brig . Gen Frank T. Hines , Administrator of the Veterans Bureau , as well as from many leading scientists from all parts of the country . Dr. Wilbur Heads Board Mr. Baruch was greatly impressed by the report and established an administrative board , headed by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur , president of Stanford University , to initiate the program . Other members of this board are Dr. Frank H. Krusen , Professor of Physical Medicine at the University of Minnesota and head of the physical medicine section of the Mayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Mary A. Boyle of New York , long-time as- I sociate of Mr. Baruch . The $1,100,000 Mr. Baruch has donated to effectuate this program , while transmitted in a lump sum , must be expended by recipient institutions over a ten-year period for specific purposes . Each center thus established must have " a specialist in clinical physical medicine and appropriately trained and interested laboratory assistants . " The division of money will be on the following basis : 1 ? The College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia will receive $400,000 for the establishment of a key center of research and teaching of physical medicine . This center is asked to give immediate assistance in maintaining an adequate supply of medical specialists to handle the problem of war and post-war physical rehabilitation of returning veterans . 2 ? The New York University College of Medicine will receive $250,000 to establish a center for teaching and special research in preventive and manipulative structural mechanics of physical medicine . 3 ? The Medical College of Virginia , from which Mr. Baruch 's father , the late Dr. Simon Baruch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of a center of teaching and research in the special fields of hydrology , climatology and spa therapy . 4 ? Selected medical schools will share in a $100,000 fund to develop an immediate program for the physical rehabilitation of war casualties and those injured in industry . 5 ? Fellowships or residences for the benefit of qualified physicians or other scientists , selected to train in this field , will be set up with the remaining $100,000 . The administrative board has taken over the offices at 597 Madison Avenue occupied by the Baruch Committee on Physical Medicine , which made the preliminary survey . Miss Grace Keefe h - ; been retained as executive secretary . Two Committees Being Formed Two other committees are now being formed to work closely with the administrative board . One is a special advisory committee and the other a committee on war and post-war rehabilitation . Announcement of the composition of these committees will be made within a few days , it was said . Specific goals of the program are : 1 ? To get an adequate supply of physicians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine technicians to apply it . There are now only 200 medical men qualified to teach the subject and 2,500 technicians , most of whom are now serving with the armed forces . Estimates are that these numbers must be multiplied fivefold . 2 ? To obtain greater basic research on the subject , including establishment of centers to promote carefully checked scientific research on commonly accepted nonmedical procedures , including those for which claims have been made by practitioners of osteopathy , chiropractic and the like . 3 ? To obtain a proper use of physical medicine in wartime rehabilitation . The original survey disclosed that 4,000,000 persons suffered from permanent physical disabilities in 1940 and that , i with the war , this figure has swelled far beyond what it ordinarily would be with a normal annual increment of 800,000 . As envisaged in this program , which will seek to avoid duplication of the work being done by other organizations along similar lines , physical medicine is a broad term , including not only physiotherapy but also occupational therapy . It encompasses hydrology , climatology and spa therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by physical medicine will be considered in research . Dr Krusen , the stocky , 46-yearold specialist in this field , who will direct the program , refers to physical medicine as " both the oldest and newest of medicines . " In the field for more than twenty years , he said yesterday that there was a crying need for teachers to meet the nation 's anticipated requirements . Teachers , Technicians Needed Twenty-one of the sixty-five medical schools in the country have said they needed teaching personnel , he revealed . He said an even greater demand was felt for trained technicians . In the past technicians have been drawn from ranks of graduate nurses , graduates in the field of physical education and college majors in the biologic sciences . These fields have been largely depleted by the war and , even with emergency courses at twenty-eight schools involving six months ' training and another six months ' apprenticeship with the armed forces , only 815 are being turned out annually . " The armed services have only one-fifth as many physical and occupational therapy technicians as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of the situation Mr. Baruch said it was the impelling motive for his : gift . " With 70,000 boys being discharged from the armed services . each month and needing the benefits of physical medicine , something had to be done , " he declared . He revealed that he had intended to make such a donation years ago " in memory of my father , who , as Professor of Hydrotherapy at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons , was a pioneer in the field . " His interest in the subject was revived in the mid-Twenties when Alfred E. Smith , then Governor , named him to the Saratoga Springs Commission " because your daddy would have liked it . " Under the Roosevelt Administration in the State Mr. Baruch was made chairman of the commission . Despite all these circumstances land the fact that he himself was a confirmed believer in physical medicine " for toning up a man 's mental and physical condition , " Mr. Baruch said he " kept putting it off until the war broke with all its fury .
