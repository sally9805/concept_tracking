txt WASHINGTON , Oct. ** voice of wisdom and experience discussing domestic affairs can scarcely be heard these days amid the reverberations of violent world events . Two examples of this public preoccupation have been furnished as recently as last week . 1 . The SEC 's mandate of competitive bidding for utility securities operated in exact reverse of its objectives when three large insurance companies were able to obtain the whole of a prime A. T. &; T. issue of $90 million in 234 , debentures , freezing out not only the investment bankers but also ? the colleges , trust and pension funds , savings banks and small insurance companies and investors who owned $80 million of the 51/2 's called in for refunding . Lewis W. Douglas pointed out the dangers of the , precedent . Yet no public demand is audible , insisting that the SEC substitute for this kind of competitive bidding and for private placement a system of negotiated transactions whereby wide distribution and sound after-markets for boards will be assured . An Analysis by Dean Pound 2 . At the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Emeritus of the Harvard Law School , made an unusually competent and penetrating analysis of the needs for reform in the Federal administrative and quasi-judicial agencies . But nothing that ' has since appeared indicates that the administration , Congress or the public has been roused from the complacency that followed the veto of the Walter-Logan bill . The sale of the telephone debentures and the procedure of the Federal agencies affect millions of Americans very intimately , the one in their acquisition and enjoyment of property , the other in the possession of their civil liberties and their birthright of even-handed justice . But the second is so much more important that it is selected for the purposes of a brief summary here . Dean Pound 's study of government by agency and its faults ran to nearly ten thousand words , which makes it impossible to review it according to its deserts in this space . However , the striking section in which he listed and discussed " seven characteristics of administrative justice * * * which have led in the United States to increasingly strong demands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject and the usefulness of the entire document . These characteristics , said Dean Pound , can be curatively treated by legislation and a general system of judicial review " quite as feasible as the uniform mode of simple appellate procedure now being adopted throughout the land for every variety of controversy that comes before the courts . " Arraigning the Agencies In capsule form , the seven sins of American administrative justice ( which affect every activity of industry and finance , including labor ) are described as follows : Its disposition not to hear fully " and with scrupulous fairness " both sides to a controversy . " In administrative adjudication there is everywhere an obstinate tendency to decide without a hearing or without hearing one of the parties or after conference with one of the parties in the absence of the other whose interests are adversely affected . " A tendency to " make determinations upon the basis of consultations had in private of of reports not divulged , giving the party affected no opportunity to refute or explain . " This Dean Pound attributes to many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensation . A tendency to " make determinations of fact seriously affecting individual rights without a basis in substantial evidence * * * to find the facts , not on the basis of hearings and evidence , but on the basis of preconceptions of facts to fit the assumed exigencies of a policy . " A tendency " to set up and give effect to policies beyond or even at variance with the statutes or the general law governing the action of the agency . * * * Usually this is done out of zeal to promote supposed social ends to which the legislative body might or might not agree . " Facts by Preconception A. tendency to determine facts " on the basis of preconceptions or assumptions of facts to fit the assumed exigencies of a policy . * * * To identify in advance one side of the controversy with a public interest and find the facts accordingly . " A tendency " to make no separation of facts and law , or of facts , law and policy to be applied to facts . * * * This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all parts of the world in the last decades . " A tendency " to delegate decision to subordinates where the law requires decision to be made by the head , and to make decision by the responsible authority a perfunctory matter . " Dean Pound went into case detail in each instance , drawing a chart of agency procedure that , is familiar to most of those who have come in contact with it . The administration has promised reforms , but has found unacceptable all that the bar associations and others have proposed . Now the abuses and excesses of the agencies are before Congress again , and Dean Pound has given the legislators a formula with which to cure them .
