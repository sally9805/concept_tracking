txt Russia and the Middle East ? two theatres of operations that are closely linked in the grand strategy of this war  --  were still the principal battlefields of the global struggle last week despite spectacular Allied attacks at Dieppe and in the Solomon . The announcement of Prime Minister Churchill 's visit to Cairo and Moscow and the replacement of General Sir Claude J. E. Auchin-Jeck , British commander in the Middle East. , by General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander , not only emphasized the importance of these theatres but demonstrated their interdependent strategy . Both are vital to the Allied cause ; in one theatre , huge armies are fighting the greatest campaigns of military history ; in the other , small forces are battling for great stakes . In Russia the campaign for Stalingrad was still fierce and unrelenting though the German pressure in the Caucasus was apparently slightly eased . But the Nazis were crossing the loop of the Don and driving close to the Volga , and in the south Krasnodar had fallen , and Navorossisk , Black Sea port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians were still fighting hard , but the slowing of the Nazi drive was probably as much due to the extended communication lines of the Germans and the necessity for consolidating their conquests and regrouping their forces as it was to Rusian resistance . Panzers in Egypt In Egypt , key to Suez and to most of the Eastern Mediterranean , the Panzers still waited at the gateway to Alexandria , as both sides brought up supplies and reinforcements to the El Alamein front and mustered reserves in other areas . General Field Marshal Erwin Rommel 's long halt seventy miles from the important British base may soon be ended if the German armies continue their success in southern Russia and can spare him reinforcements . But the shake-up of the whole British High Command in the Middle East may mean that the British may try to beat Marshal Rommel to the punch ; indeed , the long delay of the United Nations in eliminating or relieving what is a serious threat to our . Middle Eastern position can be explained only by long supply lines and inadequate means . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot weather of Summer is drawing to a close , the best season for desert fighting is approaching and soon the desert again will be aflame with battle . When that time comes , what happens in Egypt must affect what happens in Russia  --  and vice versa . Gateway to Middle East For Egypt is the gateway to the Middle East and the Middle East is a gateway to Russia and India . With the port facilities of Murmansk in a shambles from constant bombing and the sea supply route to Murmansk and Archangel exposed to German submarine and air attack , the Persian Gulf supply route to Russis is of great importance . This is increasingly true as Winter approaches and Archangel and the northern seas are frozen . It is increasingly true the nearer the Nazis approach to the Volga and the Caspian Sea , for if the Nazis reach these goals and cut off the Russian Armies of the south and the Caucasus from the central and northern armies , the Persian Gulf supply route will be the only means by which these Southern Russian forces can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route passes from the ports of the Persian Gulf across Iran to the Caspian . Supplies are flown in , transported by rail and road , sea and river . This route is beyond the immediate reach of the Germans  --  except where it debouches into Russia at Astrakhan and the Volga  --  but a German conquest of Egypt would present a serious threat to its flanks . Fronts Are Interdependent But there is more than a logistical interdependence between the two great theatres  --  Russia and the Middle East . They are strategically interdependent  --  for whoever controls the passes of the Caucasus controls not only the mineral wealth of that region but controls also the entrances into Russia  --  or vice versa  --  into the Middle East , and the Middle East , it must forever be remembered , is the crossroads between three continents . Thus the stakes in these two theatres  --  Russia and the Middle East  --  are huge ; they are nothing less than victory . For Germany can win this war  --  or prolong it to a possible stalemate  --  only in two ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push her conquests successfully deep into the heart of Russia and into the crossroads of the continents  --  the Middle East . To put herself beyond defeat by her victories in the East , Germany ,  --  and her Axis satellites  --  must do many things . ( 1 ) They must eliminate the Russian armies as a major factor in the war . The first step in this process is the current German attempt to reach the Volga and the Caspian and thus to separate the Russian r:mies and cut them off from their oil . This , if accomplished , would be a severe blow , but probably not enough . There probably would have to follow an attempt to sever the northern supply route by the capture of Murmansk or Vologda , and an attempt to capture Leningrad and the Moscow industrial area . Caucasus OH Essential Pawn ( 2 ) They must capture the oil ' ' wells of the Caucasus . With the capture of the Maikop wells the first step in this process has been completed . The importance of the Caucasus oil to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazis will increasingly feel the strain , if campaigning of the present intensity continues indefinitely . But the Caucasus oil is perhaps vitally important to Russia ; long range view this oil is essential to Reichsfuehrer Hitler if the Italians are to be adequately supplied , and if he hopes to create that " new Europe " of which he has dreamed . ( 3 ) They must conquer Egypt and probably also the coast of the Levant . Control of the Eastern Mediterranean is essential to Herr Hitler 's long range plans ; the seized oil of the Caucasus can never be adequately transported to Western Europe save with the major aid of sea transport  --  and this means control of the Black Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean by the conquest of British sea and air bases and the elimination of British sea and air power there . If Hitler should achieve these three objectives the war probably would be indefinitely prolonged , and he might then try to drive on to a fourth objective . Toward India - ( 4 ) Seizure of the Middle East oil fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he were successful in this purpose , Herr Hitler 's legions would be poised at the gateway of India , and India would be slowly starved for oil . And the war would very probably be lost . To state the stakes in Russia and the Middle East thus boldly not only serves to emphasize the crucial importance of these two interdependent theatres but illustrates how small a part of his task Herr Hitler has as yet accomplished . He is very far indeed from his grandiose dreams of unchallenged supremacy : his " Drang nach Osten " has carried him only to the bulging foothills of the Caucasus with many weary miles and the stout legions of half a score of races between him and his goal . Yet , there is danger ; the situation in Russia has steadily deteriorated since the end of June ; in Egypt Marshal Rommel is an everpresent threat . If free men are to live free lives and the vital theatres of Russia and the Middle East are to be held for the United Nations , these threats must be met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moscow and Cairo Stresses Their Interpendence By IIANSON W.
