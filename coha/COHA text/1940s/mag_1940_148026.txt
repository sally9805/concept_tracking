In 1929 red-haired Catherine McNelis , then an advertising agent in Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , persuaded F. W. Woolworth Co. to market a group of 10 magazines specially edited for the dime-store trade . Miss McNelis organized Tower Magazines , Inc. , soon had seven magazines with a total circulation of some 900,000 copies . <P> Then something went wrong . In 1935 Publisher McNelis declared her corporation bankrupt , admitted liabilities of $400,000 . She blamed high printing costs . But a Federal Grand Jury accused her of falsifying circulation figures , withholding some $1,000,000 in rebates due advertisers . With three of her associates , Catherine McNelis was indicted for using the mails to defraud . <P> Last week in Manhattan a trial jury found Catherine McNelis guilty . Maximum penalty : 35 years in prison ( five years on each of seven specific charges ) , fines totaling $7,000.
