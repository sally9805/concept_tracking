Spruille Braden , U.S. Ambassador to Argentina , summoned the U.S. correspondents into his office . Pleased as an outsized Punch , he " announced that the Argentine Government had abolished all press censorship . Henceforth the newsmen might cable their stories direct , without subterfuge , delay or fear of retaliation . The correspondents were properly gratified , gave hard-hitting Braden much of the credit . Only one skeptic remarked : " Seems we heard this before . " <P> As a further concession to local and foreign pressure , the Argentine Government had already announced that it would free its political prisoners . It actually freed some 265 . Invited back from exile in Montevideo was Argentina 's revered elder statesman , walrus-mustached Alfredo Palacios , a vigorous antifascist , to resume his old job as president of La Plata University . <P> The Government 's change of heart was not taken too seriously in Argentina . Three hundred and nineteen influential business associations blasted at its militarists . Censorship had often been " abolished , " but it always came back again . The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those released last week were only a fraction of the total , and the paralyzing " state of siege ' ' was still in force . <P> Few doubted that President Farrell and Vice President Peron wanted the support of the United Nations , and ( as a price ) were willing to restore to the Argentine people some of their democratic liberties . But spotted through their administration were other powerful politicians who felt that to yield would be fatal . Most notorious were Filomeno Velazco , chief of police , and General Juan Pistarini , Minister of Public Works . Tenaciously , they and their fellows clung to power , preventing the Government 's concessions from having much effect . Said Pistarini ( according to Vanguardia ) : " We shall relinquish the Government when frogs grow hair . "
