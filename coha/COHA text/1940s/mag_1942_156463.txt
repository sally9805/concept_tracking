In Brooklyn it was " heart rendering . " <P> Just a year ago last week the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn 's Dodgers had faced one another in a do-or-die showdown for the National League pennant . And Brooklyn 's big Righthander Whit Wyatt had pitched the Dodgers to a 1-to-0 shutout against the Cards ' big Righthander Mort Cooper . <P> Now Cooper and Wyatt were on the mound again and it was happening all over again , only not quite the same way . During August the scrappy young Cardinals had come up from behind until now they were only two games behind the faltering Dodgers . Cooper had not lost a game since he discarded his No. 13 shirt in disgust , and begun borrowing that teammate 's shirt whose number corresponded to the number of the game he wanted to win . <P> That voodoo did it . Wearing Coaker Triplett 's No. 20 last week , Cooper allowed only three hits ( no Dodger reached second base ) , gave only one walk , scored two runs himself , shut out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games ahead of St. Louis on Aug. 4-to a lead of only one slim game . Sure enough , next day , behind Southpaw Max Lanier , the Cards took the Dodgers again , 2-to-1 , to tie for the lead . <P> " I think we 're in , " gloated Cardinal President Sam Breadon , banking on this year 's team to repeat the miracle stretch drives of 1930 and 1934 . <P> In 1930 the Cards won 20 of the last 23 games of the season to clinch the pennant . In 1934 they clinched it with 20 out of the last 25 . This year the Cards have won 29 of their last 34 games . <P> With only 14 more to go , President Breadon confidently ordered World Series tickets printed .
