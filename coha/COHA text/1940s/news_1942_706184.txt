txt A fairly good set of automobile tires will last ten years or more . All you have to do , according to information furnished by experts , is to draw up a tireuse budget . Although there 's a big new synthetic rubber program , most civilians are still advised on good authority not to count on any new tires for an indefinite period  --  years . not months . Firestone Tire &; Rubber Co. and Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. , which recently announced plans to make tires from reclaimed rubber , have been advised by the government these tires are not to be sold to civilian users . Story on Page 5 A tire budget is simple to make . The part is to follow it . The components plan for the life of the tires you already are these : 1 . The condition of your tires. 2 . The speed at which you want to travel 3 . The distance , per year , you want to drive . 4 . The number of years you want to make sure of the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile owners , is that tire deterioration by age alone is slow and that even if your tires are half-way worn out , by normal standards , the remaining wear can be budgeted carefully over a decade . Low Speed Limit Will Help A second fact , somewhat more widely appreciated , is that Americans normally waste tires like fury and that a 30-mile speed limit , selfimposed , will do wonders in prolonging tire mileage . Other rules , such as not scraping curbs or running tires half-fiat , are fairly obvious , but speed reduction will take a real change in the average driver 's habits . Here is the basic information compiled from research reports made available by the tire makers , that you need to start a tire budget : A new passenger car tire is good . on the average , for 15,000 miles " safe driving " under what has been the American standard of automobile travel . That 's the estimate of S. P. Thacher , technologist of U. S. Rubber Co . But it is based on average usage of the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily be doubled by a tire-budgeter . ( Tires wear twice as fast at 50 miles an hour as they do at 30 . ) Tire companies have authenticated instances of tires that went over 50.000 miles . Retreading Benefits Retreading will add about SO , ; , of the original casing life to an old , but basically sound tire . Retreading at some future date , however , is not something on which the average motorist should count . With a tire life of at least 30.000 miles pretty well established , the question of how long this mileage can be stretched out becomes important . Deterioration of tires , aside from wear , is not subject to exact measurement . But the experts seem agreed that in modern tires there is no deterioration for three years , if the tire is given the right kind of protection from heat , light and oil . if the tire is used instead of stored it seems that its deterioration is postponed another year . Tires do better when they are used carefully than if they are not used at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare regularly . ) Life of Some Tires After a tire starts to deteriorate , according to standards set up by the technicians , at still has a lot of life in it , with careful use , many years One company In Akron knows of a motorist who used a set of tires for 32 years There are many cases of 20-year tires . A motorcycle purchaser not long ago got a machine that had been in storage since the last war and found the tires were still good . So the ageing of a tire , like its mileage wear depends to a large extent on care , and tire budgeters will assure the tenderest care . The condition of old tires , is of course , something that has to be estimated . But if a set of tires has gone about 7,500 miles under average use it presumably has 7.500 miles of average use left in it and by applying careful conservation methods this theoretical amount of unused mileage can at least be doubled and perhaps tripled . Minimum Mileage Necessary Then the tire budget is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do whatever the individual motorist has in mind to do with ohs automobile . and letting the number of years depend on the quotient when unused mileage is divided by annual planned use . Or the tire budget can be laid out on a termof-years basis . Suppose you want to be sure of having a car to use for ten years  --  then the unused mileage is divided by ten , and that 's the distance you can drive each year if you observe all the tire saving rules and do n't encounter any sheer bad luck . Of course , tires may become available to civilians much sooner than 1952 . But the rationing authorities in Washington still think the average consumer is too optimistic about the time when he 'll get tires again . Tire waste has been a normal thing in the Urited States . One of the first conservation rules emphasized by the tire experts is propel inflation Five pounds under-pressure cuts tire life 20 , , , .. they say . Racing tires have been known to wear out in 12 miles , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for about 1.000 miles if they are run continuously on a regular highway pavement at 100 miles an hour . But even a speed cut from 50 to 40 miles an hour or a further reduction from 40 to 30 makes a big difference in wear . Alignment of Wheels The experts do n't recommend , as a rule , a speed limit of less than 30 miles an hour although one of them said yesterday that maximum mileage could tneoretically be attained at less than one mile per hour . Bad wheel alignment is , of course , hard on tires because it scuffs off the rubber . A wheel a half-inch out of line drags a tire sideways 8't feet every mile tt rolls . The tire rotation formula usually recommended is this : Spare to left front ; left front tire to left rear ; left rear to right front , right front to right rear , right rear becomes the spare . The experts say remember that heat , sunlight and oil are the enemies of tires . The research department of a leading Akron firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage one month , do n't bother to jack it up . The air will stay in your tires that long and no purpose would be served by putting it on blocks . But if you plan to go to Florida for two months , you 'd better hack the car up or , better still , take the tires off , wrap them up and store them in a dry basement .
