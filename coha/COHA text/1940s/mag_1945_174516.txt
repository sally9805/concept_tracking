Rumple-haired , dry-humored William Hammatt Davis wondered if he had jumped out of the frying pan into the fire . After three harried years as War Labor Board chairman , he was appointed last week to succeed Fred Vinson as U.S. Economic Stabilizer . <P> It had been Will Davis ' job to hold the line on wages ; it would be his job now to hold the line on wages and prices too-to guard the whole U.S. against the insistent pressure of inflation . Grinning , the 65-year-old Manhattan patent lawyer wryly described the assignment as " a nice little job . " <P> To Washington observers the Davis appointment meant that for the moment , at least , labor had lost its long fight for upward revision of the Little Steel formula . Few weeks ago Davis and WLB 's other public members had recommended to Franklin Roosevelt that Little Steel be kept . <P> But labor , already off on another tack , hoped that Davis would adopt a more liberal attitude than Vinson 's in connection with " fringe " awards , i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not affect basic wage rates . This issue , now vital to the unions , was sizzling on Davis ' desk before he had a chance to sit down . <P> For weeks , WLB had been chafing under firm Fred Vinson 's restrictions on fringe awards , wanted him to loosen up , give the board more authority . Last week , as his last official act before becoming Loan Administrator , Vinson handed down a ruling , setting up specific and narrow limits for the granting of such increases . C.I.O. and A.F. of L. promptly howled that the Vinson formula was " completely unworkable , " rolled up their sleeves for a shindig . That brought a new figure into the play . Will Davis ' place as WLB chairman had been taken by roly-poly , moon-faced Dr. George William Taylor , longtime vice chairman of the Board . Dr. Taylor , a professor of labor relations at the University of Pennsylvania , wasted no time putting his ex-boss up on the edge of the frying pan . At week 's end he announced that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling , make fringe increases easier for labor to get .
