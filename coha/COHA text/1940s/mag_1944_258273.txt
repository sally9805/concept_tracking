MARINES <P> When the Marines ' square-faced , bespectacled Lieut . General Thomas Holcomb , 64 , retires on New Year 's Day as commandant of the Corps , he will become a full general , the first in the 168-year-old history of the Marines . <P> A law passed several years ago authorizes officers decorated in World War I for services beyond the call of duty to go up one grade upon retirement . Veteran Tommy Holcomb commanded a Marine battalion in World War I , was under fire at St. Mihiel , Soissons , the Argonne . Lieut . Colonel Holcomb came out strewn with ribbons . <P> Another award awaits serious , hardworking General Holcomb : the Distinguished Service Medal , already authorized by the House and awaiting only Senate action . Another job also awaits General Holcomb , but that is still the Navy 's well-kept secret . Best guess to date : a place among the Allied Joint Chiefs of Staff .
