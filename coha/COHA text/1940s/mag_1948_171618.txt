The Baltimore Sun was backing John W. Davis for President , and needed a political cartoonist with punch . From the Brooklyn Eagle , the Sun borrowed young ( 25 ) Edmund Duffy for three months . That was in 1924 , and the dapper Duffy never went back to Brooklyn . He now shares the record ( with Rollin Kirby ) of winning three Pulitzer Prizes for cartoons . Last week Duffy decided to quit the Sun . He wanted a vacation-and would spend it mulling over some better offers that had been waved under his nose . <P> At 15 , " Duff " Duffy , son of a Jersey City cop , was barred from a life class at the Art Students League in Manhattan because he was still in short pants . He went to work on the old New York Herald and the Evening Post as an illustrator and left , at 22 , to sail for Europe with only $150 in his pocket . He studied art and sipped vermouth on an empty stomach in Paris , then came back home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw one of his bold , blunt cartoons . He spends the rest of his time in the office sharpening his wits on the staff . When an editorial writer complained that the cartoonist wasted his valuable time , Sun Editor ( now emeritus ) John W. Owens replied that Duffy was worth his weight as a " fertilizing agent . " <P> With his grease crayon , Duffy worries mostly about politics ( he is not fond of politicians of any variety ) , peace and the plight of the poor taxpayer . The rest of the time he worries about horses . On almost any good afternoon Duffy can be found at the track . As long as they 're running at Pimlico , Baltimore does not expect to lose Duffy for good .
