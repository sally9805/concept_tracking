Last April Secretary of State Stettinius ( presumably with the knowledge and consent of President Roosevelt ) , swore there were no more secret agreements at Yalta except military ones . This week , on Yalta 's first anniversary , his successor released what he swore was Yalta 's last secret agreement . <P> Its text had been kept secret even from Jimmy Byrnes until last week , six months after the time when military necessity might have excused a hush-hush policy . While it had a military consideration ( Russia 's joining in the Japanese war ) , the agreement itself was as political as a pork barrel . Stalin 's help in the Far East was to be rewarded with the Kuril Islands , an " independent " Mongolia and all Tsarist Russia 's Far East rights . Roosevelt promised to get China 's concurrence . This Yalta deal was the basis of last year 's Sino-Russian pact ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) . <P> Expediency and an extraordinary personalization of government had made possible this disposal of men and territories in private conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole world was evident in their statement in the text : " The heads of the three great Powers have agreed that these claims of the Soviet Union shall be unquestionably fulfilled . " <P> But expediency was not enough to cover the loss to the U.S. moral position from secret diplomacy . The U.S. had come so far from Wilson 's " open covenants openly arrived at " that no one knew whether Byrnes himself knew that the latest Yalta disclosure would be the last .
