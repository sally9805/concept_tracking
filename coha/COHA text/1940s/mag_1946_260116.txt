" A high point of his trip : roaring through a city ( " perhaps I had better not say which " ) at 80 m.p.h. with police escort ( " which thrills me to the marrow " ) . <P> Other Cantuarisms : <P> On education- " Universities have lost their synthesizing power , provide nothing but fragments of knowledge .
