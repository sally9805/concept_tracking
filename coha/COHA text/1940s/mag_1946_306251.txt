Among railroadmen , Alleghany Corp . ' s Bob Young has been as popular as a bee in a bridal bouquet . Particularly annoying has been his constant buzzing in the public 's ear about the horse &; buggy way of running transcontinental trains so that passengers must change at Chicago . Last week he was at it again in full-page newspaper ads ( see cut ) : " A hog can cross the country without changing trains-but YOU ca n't . " <P> U.S. railroads were stung into action .

Best guess : six to eight months . <P> Bob Young still hopes to set up his own through Pullman service . The Department of Justice gave him encouragement last week when it asked the U.S. Supreme Court to ban the sale of the Pullman Co. to a combination of 52 railroads . Although the sale had been approved by a District Court as a method of dissolving Pullman 's monopoly , Justice argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's candidate for ownership of the Pullmans : Bob Young .
