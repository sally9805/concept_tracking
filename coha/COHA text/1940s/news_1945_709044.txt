txt THE CUSTOMERS SOUND OFF ON MOVIE PRICES THOMAS BAKER Jr.FRANCIS M. SMITH.BETTY AVRICH. pg . X3 THE CUSTOMERS SOUS D OFF ON MOVIE PRICES To the Screen Editor : YOUR stand on current theatre prices is admirable , and long overdue . Theatre , managers have been milking the public dry . You mentionl " Blithe Spirit " ? I wanted very , much to see that film and about three Sundays ago I traveled into town and rushed to the Winter Garden , but I stopped short at the box office . The sign read $1.70 ? and the fleet was still on the Pacific side of the Canal ! Mister , that made me angry and I decided then and there that I would not see " Blithe Spirit " at the Winter Garden  --  even if the admission was lowered to 75 cents , where it should have been all along . The legitimate branch of the entertainment world needs a little of the wind spanked out of it , too . " Girl From Nantucket " has an ad in the paper quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who can afford $6 for a pair of seats in the last row of the Adelphi Theatre ? I love the theatre , and the movies , too , but it is becoming increasingly difficult to support them . Managers are quick to blame the public for not supporting the lively arts and , yet , ' when the public does begin to make a habit of going to theatres , managers then begin to drive them back to their homes and radios again . THOMAS BAKER Jr . Passaic , N. J. Assorted Complaints To the Screen Editor : Read your interview with Mr. Publique last Sunday and I was glad to see someone , at last , is expressing what so many have felt for so long . As to the high prices ? we have the power to stop that , if we will . Apparently there are not enough of us to stay away to make the moguls of the box office wake up . They seem to adopt the slogan of the late Texas Guinan as to " suckers . " But the war pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty in money and blood ? and they 're handed out to us as , when and how the movie people want us to get them  --  and they make us pay plenty for them . " The public be damned " is , unfortunately , not a forgotten slogan . Another pet gripe of mine  --  pictures like Johnston 's Eric A. address when he took over Hays ' job . A lot 3f hooey and propaganda we had to pay to sit through each time we went to a movie for two weeks . The glorification of the movie industry 's : patriotic effort is another thing which causes me nausea . FRANCIS M. SMITH . Philadelphia , Pa . OPA Bows Out To the Screen Editor : I thoroughly enjoy seeing a good movie , and , hence , I can count on my one hand the good pictures I have seen this year . Thus , you will gather that I rarely go the customary " once a week " to the movies . However , when I do go I resent having to pay the outrageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stuff emanating from Hollywood is quite rank . Since the OPA was taking such an interest in fixing ceilings on food , clothing , rents , etc. , I wrote to them asking why they did not fix ceilings on the cinema , and they very blandly replied that " it was not within their jurisdiction . " No other explanation was offered . Granted that food , clothing and housing are necessities , the movies , in the form of entertainment are a morale necessity , and hence should be brought under control as well . What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander . Of course , I appreciate , as the other side would refute , that the movies are considered luxuries and are riot necessary to the very existence of life . But if we do without all the little luxuries which tend to make life worth living , where are you and what have you got ? BETTY AVRICH . New York City , N. Y.                @ @ @ @ @
