In science classes at School Street Elementary School , in Westbury , L. I. , pupils study live mice , rabbits , ducks , chicks . They are fond of their pets . One day last October , they got a ten-pound Poland China shoat , six weeks old . Three hundred science pupils took a vote , decided to nickname him Fat Stuff . They made him a nice clean pen with a big trough , running water and a straw bed . They watched him get three vaccinations against hog diseases . They took delight in feeding him tidbits , fed him so well that in three months he grew to 120 pounds . <P> Recently Jerome Fitzpatrick , superintendent of Westbury 's schools , told a science supervisor in the State Education Department about Fat Stuff . The science supervisor suggested educational possibilities in Fat Stuff that had not occurred to Mr. Fitzpatrick . <P> One day last week 125 pupils gathered dutifully in their schoolyard to watch Fat Stuff 's last lesson . First a health inspector examined Fat Stuff . Then he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slit Fat Stuff 's throat . <P> Afterwards the pupils went downstairs to the boiler room , there quietly watched a science teacher dissect Fat Stuff . They saw where bacon , ham and pork chops come from , saw Fat Stuff 's stomach , lungs , liver , heart . In a few days any pupils who have the appetite for it will be able to eat Fat Stuff in the school cafeteria .
