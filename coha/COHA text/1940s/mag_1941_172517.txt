What happens to prices when the President 's 2,000,000-ton shipping pool curtails coastwise and intercoastal shipping , adding costly rail rates to goods which now move cheaply by sea ? This problem landed on the desk of OPACS Chief Leon Henderson ( see p. 16 ) last week , and it looked as though busy Leon might have some answers ready . <P> In 1940 more than 7,000,000 tons of coast-to-coast freight moved via the Panama Canal . Chief west-to-east items are lumber and wood pulp , canned goods , gasoline and fuel oil . From east to west the big items are steel and manufactured goods . Rail rates are from two to four times higher than water rates . On some bulk commodities this difference could add 25% to 50% to delivered cost . Recently this margin has narrowed , for many shipping rates have increased , while the railroad rates have not . <P> Some price hikes probably are inevitable , but Henderson thinks many of them can be prevented . For one thing , he knows the existing freight-rate structure bears no systematic relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the increased traffic now in sight would move from south to north and from west to east-the directions in which the costly movement of empty freight cars is now heaviest . Meanwhile the railroads have been experimenting with low rates for trainload hauls . Moreover , railroad net operating income has risen sharply this year . If Henderson is to prevent price increases , he will have to get power from Congress to find some way of putting through reduced freight rates for shipments diverted from water transportation ; or else he will have to make up the difference to the shippers . <P> Prices are not the only problem raised for Henderson by the President 's shipping pool . As combination price and supply commissioner , Henderson is the New Deal official closest to the job of finding sufficient transportation for all the freight diverted from canal to roadbed . The New Deal has long regarded rail capacity as a potential bottleneck . <P> The diversion of lumber shipments now made through the canal , it is estimated , would add 6,000 carloads a month to the rails ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16,000,000 cases a year of fruits and vegetables from the West Coast which now will be dumped on to the railroads-or on to overworked transcontinental trucks . Also added to west-to-east rail traffic will be imported goods from the Pacific carried by ships which formerly continued on through the canal to East Coast ports . Since ships waste 30-35 days going to the East Coast and returning to the Pacific , such cargoes now will be landed on the West Coast , sent overland by rail . Important among them are rubber ( estimated to amount to 354,000 tons this year ) , and tin ( 45,000 tons ) from the Far East . Furthermore , nitrates ( 300,000 tons ) and copper ( 300,000 tons ) from South America 's West Coast may soon be landed in the South , shipped north by rail .
