One-Man Show ( by Ruth Goodman and Augustus Goetz ; produced by Jed Harris ) concerns a middle-aged widower and his daughter ( Frank Conroy &; Constance Cummings ) who run an art gallery . Attractive and sought after , the girl is indifferent to other men because she is pathologically attached to her father . The father tries to cut the cord between them ; the girl holds tight . <P> Then , suddenly , she falls very much in love with a new suitor-and One-Man Show drops from its sleeve the card whose edge had , for some time back , been just discernible to the lynx-eyed . It was the father who , deliberately or not , had fostered the girl 's fixation ; it is the father who tries now to preserve it . <P> A clever play , with some pointed dialogue and a sophisticated art-gallery air , One-Man Show is spurious drama . It puts slickness ahead of seriousness , sacrifices the characters to the plot . But Jed Harris 's shrewd direction-as has often happened in the past two decades-makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy Wonder of the 1920s , lantern-jawed , shiny-haired Jed Harris ( now 45 ) chalked up a record which probably no Broadway producer has equaled since : four successive smash hits ( Broadway , Coquette , The Royal Family , The Front Page ) in less than two years . At the age of 28 he had ( counting road companies ) seven productions on the boards at once , and an income of $40,000 a week . <P> In return he gave to show business a drive and mettlesomeness ( as both producer and director ) that acted like ozone , even if at times they were only shots of dope . In addition to being good shows , Broadway and The Front Page set a trend in colorful , hard-hitting entertainment ; they caught the garish , profane , melodramatic spirit of an era . <P> As the era ended- in September 1929- Harris " retired .

A meteoric manager , Harris ( real name : Jacob Horowitz ) is a volcanic man . Born in Newark ( though he later said he was born in Vienna ) , he read omnivorously at Yale for two years , then quit . He bummed his way west and then abroad , coming home a stowaway in a tramp steamer . Home now meant Broadway . Harris became a press agent for the Shuberts and " stamped and cried with rage " at the way his bosses butchered scripts . When he had saved up $3,000 he started producing on his own . <P> At the height of his success , Harris disparaged it by quoting Critic Percy Hammond 's dictum that " the theater is the shell game of the arts .
