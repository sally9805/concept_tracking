txt Six months after the S3,750,000,000 loan to Britain came under discussion , the Senate reached the point of approval , not so much ho cause it wanted the loan but be- ! cause its leadership had so arranged matters that only after passage of the loan could it vent its feelings toward John L. Lewis . So heated has Congress become over the coal strike that almost certaiply drastic , if ineffective , antistrike legislation will be passed , if settlement is not achieved within a week . There is no present indication that legislation so far proposed will greatly affect Mr. Lewis , or even . reach him . On the contrary , the prospect is that the burden will fall mostly on other , well organized , labor or ganizations , some of which , like the C. I. 0. , have criticized bitterly Mr. Lewis tactics . Even more probable , the legislation now being beaten hastily into shape will turn out to be another Smith - Connally " anti-strike " law . which has come to symbolize in and out of Congress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . But in any case , the Senate is aching to go and the British loan got the benefit . Swept through by the same current of wrath against Mr. Lewis was another legislative by-product , extension of the Draft Act for six weeks . If the House agrees to this proposal it means that the Draft Act , which otherwise ex- pires next Wednesday , will be continued , as is , until Congress can get around to formulating a substitute . The Senate 's action leaves 18-. , year old boys all over America in uncertainty . The . House version of the extension bill would exempt them from service ; the Senate 6 weeks ' proposal merely continues the status quo in stopgap fashion.1 Senate in Snarl . Nobody can say that the Senate has operated efficiently in this matter . Today 's troubles all stem from the dilatory tactics over the loan to Britain , which purposely dragged out proceedings and resulted in the present triple jam of draft , loan , and labor crises , all superimposed . Most observers feel the loan easily could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Senator Theodore G. Bilbo ( D ) of Missitsippi and William Langer ( R ) of North Dakota , took the course of postponing matters in hopes it would be displaced . Their tactics failed , and Mr. Bilbo did not even take the trouble of being present when today 's vote finally came . The real key to the trouble is the lax rules of the Senate which permit a filibuster to go unchecked and permit such a piling up of problems resulting in hasty  --  and often ineffective  --  legislation . Dramatic Climax The climax of the whole affair came in a hectic half hour yesterday shortly after noon . Senator Alben W. Barkley ( D ) of Kentucky was on his feet constantly . The Chamber was crowded . Members knew that the tangle would have to be solved , and nobody could tell which way it would go . All the virtues of Mr. Barkley 's genial , patient , persuasive leadership were revealed . Always presenting himself as the servant rather than the master of the Senate , intent only on upholding its dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooled rising tempers , repeatedly explained where lay the best interests of all parties , and so manipulated developments that the Senate  --  almost to its own astonishment  --  found itself agreeing to get rid of the loan to Britain first . Thereby pressure growing from the jam on the other two matters , the draft and the strike , piled up behind the loan . Why not agree to extend the Draft Act for 6 weeks here and now , and put it aside ? Somebody asked . Mr. Barkley , who has been angling hard for that very objective , casually admitted that that could be done . Of course , he explained , with a great show of reluctance , it would require unanimous consent . In less than two minutes unanimous consent was obtained and the Draft Act was disposed of , at least temporarily . Then Mr. Barkley pointed out that the sooner the loan to Britain was voted on the sooner the Chamber could take up strike legislation . It was like dropping pebbles into a cataract . The force of the anti-Lewis feeling swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to limit speeches . Amendments Defeated The Senate began taking up amendments and voting a them down . Most of the fight had gone out of the loan opponents , following Wednesday 's defeat of the amendment , 40 to 45 , which would have made the loan contingent on receiving British bases . A point of order against the loan by Senator Edwin C. Johnson ( D ) of Colorado . was knocked out 27 to 54 . The Capehart Amendment cutting the loan to $1,500,000,000 was defeated 25 to 55 . A demagogic amendment by Senator Langer , to make loans for U. S. veterans on the terms offered the British , got only 12 votes . Mr. Langer , however , grew angry , and by continually proposing new amendments he was able to talk indefinitely , and it seemed as though there might be an all-night session . However , just before 11 p. m. an agreement for a final vote at 3 p. m. today was approved . There was not doubt of passage , and the big matter now goes to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
