A lot of people think that what U.N . needs most is divine guidance . Ever since its foundation , letters have poured in urging that U.N . open its sessions with a prayer . A nondenominational " prayer room " was proposed for U.N . ' s new Manhattan headquarters . Bowing to the fact that U.N . ' s members are of many different faiths ( some are specifically atheistic ) , a special committee of the General Assembly last week dodged the explosive issue . It recommended merely that each annual assembly session be opened and closed with a minute of silence , which each delegate would be free to use for prayer , for meditation , or reflection on the five-year plan . <P> The minute-long nod to God-or to production in the ball-bearing works-was calculated to give the least offense to the smallest number . Even so , it barely got by . Out of 15 committee members only eight voted for it ; the Soviet Union , France and two others abstained ; three members had stayed away from the meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
