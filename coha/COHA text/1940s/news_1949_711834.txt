txt Federal Judge Harold R. Medina warned lawyers for the eleven Communist leaders yesterday to stop their delaying tactics . He said the " whole administration of justice here " would be paralyzed if they continued calling jurors as witnesses without limit . Then he indicated he would soon " shorten the proceedings " by interrupting the procession of jurors to the stand . However , he allowed the defense to put fourteen more jurors on the stand in the Course of the day , making a total of eighteen who have now been called . Thirteen were members of the grand jury that indicted the defendants on the charge of organizing the Communist party to teach and advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence . The others were members of the current panel from which the , trial jury is to be chosen . There are twenty-three members of the grand jury and 525 members of the panel . All eighteen have testified they were never asked by jury officials about their race , religion , political affiliations , social connections or financial worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Attorney John F.

Mr. this evidence to controvert the main charge in the Communists ' challenge to the jury system In this Federal district . The defense contends the indictment should be voided and the jury panel quashed on the ground that the system results in the deliberate exclusion from juries of Negroes , Jews , women , manual workers , the poor , and members of the Communist party and the American Labor party . Two women and several persons , with Jewish names were among // the jurors who testified . There were no Negroes , no manual workers and no obviously poor persons among the witnesses . Most of them were business and professional men . n this connection , Judge Medina has notified the defense it is not enough to show that certain groups are represented on juries . He has said deliberate exclusion of the groups mentioned in the challenge must be proved . So far , such evidence has not been submitted . The judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the opening of yesterday 's session . This ended a four-day adjournment since last Friday . The usual week-end recess had been lengthened to let Richard Gladstein of defense counsel go to San Francisco for another court appearance . Leaning over the bench in his black robes , the judge looked sternly at Harry Sacher of defense counsel and in a firm tone rebuked him for " twisting " the judge 's statements . Mr. Sacher had just quoted the judge as having agreed last week to hear all the jurors the defense wished to call . The judge said he had merely promised to hear the evidence necessary to make up his mind how to rule on a prosecution motion to kill the challenge so far as it applies to the grand jury . " The unusual way this matter is going , the great amount of repetitious argument and the manner in ' which proof is offered , " the judge said , " is making this task very difficult .

Two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamson , labor secretary , of the Communist party ? stood up and protested against the case 's continuing in the absence of their attorney , Abraham J. laserman of New York . They asked an adjournment until today because he was in Washington yesterday arguing a case before the United States Court of Appeals . Leave ? of Absence Refused The judge coldly remarked that he had refused to give Mr. Isserman leave to absent himself , and hinted he might have to do something about it , albeit " reluctantly . " He then added that his weekend study of the record of last week 's proceedings had indicated a " concerted move to delay the case . " Mr. Sacher denied this , and the judge then said in a weary tone of voice : " Then I 'll put that thought from my mind for the present , but this is a rather difficult situation that has come up because of the conduct of counsel .

" At least what you 've said has been in good taste . But the thought has finally entered my mind that all this business about the jury is just a series of deliberate maneuvers for delay . " Mr. Sacher jumped up with a show of indignation at this , pointing his finger at the judge and angrily saying : " Let 's have no more of this talk ? let 's call the witnesses . " Clients Waive Representation This was done after Mr. Isserman 's clients stood up and waived their right to be represented by counsel , during the rest of the day 's proceedings . As Mr. Gladstein had not returned from San Francisco , his clients did likewise . They are Robert G. Thompson , New York State chairman , and Gus Hall , Ohio chairman , of the Communist party . In the testimony of one witness the judge chided Mr. Sacher for " bad taste " in making " personal remarks " about a witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner and customer 's representative in the brokerage house of Orvis Brothers &; Co. , 14 Wall Street .

Mr. Sacher got up from the counsel table and walked close to the witness box to hand Mr. Johnson a paper to examine . Then the lawyer backed away a few feet and asked the witness if he earned more than $20.001 ) a year . Conforming to his ruling against such questions , the judge refused to let this be answered . Then the lawyer , turning toward the public section of the courtroom , laughed sarcastically and said : " Well , he looks as if he earned it .
