 | There are in the United States about 12,000,000 dogs , and they at approximately one twentieth as : Lich as the human beings in this ) untry . Dogs eat as much farm produce is grown by all the New England - ates , New York , New Jersey , Delaware , and Maryland . What dogs eat daily would fill a eight train four miles long . The food consumed by dogs in a : . ear would fill freight cars occupy. : : g about 1,000 miles of track , preous at this time , and the cars are : - eeded badly for hauling materials r armament production . The roblem of feeding our dogs is a - aggering one . People interested in dog feeding sought that when canned dog food as no longer available , dog owners would give their pets food that people do n't require . In England ' dog lovers were compelled to abandon human food as sustenance for their pets . They discovered how foolish and unnecessary it is for people to think they must feed their dogs the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erroneously judge the value dog food by whether or not the eats it ravenou ly . They scw , too , that in carefully controlled experiments dogs grew fastest and thrived best on diets they first had to become accustomed to . They learned that the taste test is no indication whatever of what constitutes the best dog diets . With canned dog food almost gone , people here are turning to out-and-out human food to feed their pets ? only making matters worse . Recently I talked with a representative of one of America 's great packing houses , whose job is to sell by-products excellent for dogs . I asked him what he had learned about the increased use of good dry dog foods , now that canned food has become scarce . His answer was alarming , for he said the increased sale of these by-products was all out of proportion to the decrease in canned food , indicating clearly that people are feeding their own food to dogs . For many years I have been breeding dogs and conducting nu- tritional and other research with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they grew to maturity . One of the things that I , in common with other students of canine nutrition , have learned is that most of the old ideas about dog feeding were pretty badly grounded and some are sheer nonsense . The finest feature about it is that research has upset completely some of these ideas , and this can be of great help to us in mapping a sound feeding plan . We actually can build a feeding regime on what were once taboos . Ho v often have you heard the following ? 1 . A dog ca n't digest starch . 2 . A dog must never be fed sweets . 3 . A dog must never be fed fat . 4 . A dog must have raw , lean meat . You 've heard them all ; yet there is n't a word of truth in them . First untruth : a dog ca n't digest starch . Of course he can ; but he gulps his food and does n't chew the starches . Because raw starchy foods were found to pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ptyalin ( one of the starch-digesting enzymes ) in his saliva , he was believed unable to digest starch . All we have to do is to heat the starch enough to break the granules , so the dog 's digestive juices can get at it . A dog can digest potatoes , corn meal , cake , bread , rice , dog biscuits , and all the other starchy foods . Nor do these starches produce skin troubles ; they have n't been shown to in any careful research to date . I never have found a single case of skin trouble on a dog that I could not cure externally , and this indicates that food rarely causes it . Second untruth : a dog must never be fed sweets . Dogs can handle sweet foods as well as we can . But they make him finicky , just as they do us , so they should be fed with discretion . Third untruth : a dog must never be fed fat . Do n't take my word that this is a myth that should be forgotten ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Now , it is true that he ca n't eat only fat and muscle meat for very long and stay well . Food chemists have a saying , " Fat burns in the flame of carbohydrates , " meaning that if you feed your dog fat , see that there is starch or sugar with it . Butter without bread would become unappetizing ; but the combination is mighty good . I have been feeding dogs fat for years , in some cases more than 25 percent based on the dry weight . Fourth untruth : a dog must have raw , lean meat . I have mentioned fat , so we @#  | can forget the lean part of this untruth . How about raw meat ? A dog just loves it when he is accustomed to it . But if he does n't know the taste of it , as is the case with more than 100 of my dogs right now , he must be taught to eat it , just as a dog that has been eating raw meat will have to be taught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the things no person should mind foregoing if our government places a restriction against it . Meat by-products , well dehydrated , will serve the same purpose ; so will fish , on which any dog will thrive . And he does well , too , on the vegetable proteins like peanut , soybean , and grains . He needs good mixtures of a variety of proteins to make sure he obtains all the amino acids ? the building blocks of proteins ? but he does not have to have raw , lean meat . Your dog does not need fresh meat , which is costly to produce , costly to store , costly to transport , to say nothing of the wasteful expense of feeding it to dogs . He does not need eggs ? in fact , he ca n't digest the white of uncooked eggs . He does not need fresh milk or butter or ice cream . What , then , should he be fed ? First , remember that a dog has likes different from yours and mine . We have trained dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ripe old bone that had  | been buried for several weeks ? A dog does . Would you like to tear an animal apart and eat the insides first ? He does ? if you let him be natural . He does because he loves that partly digested starch in the paunch and intestines . Not nice so think about ? Of course not . But he kkes things we do n't like . Moreover , he can do something we ca n't do , and I , who have followed my bloodhounds on many a trail , envy him for it ? he can unscramble odors . You and I smell soup when soup is set before us ; but a dog can smell each of the ingredients separately . He can have variety in one food , so he does not need it in separate courses . Do n't feel bad if you have to feed him a mixed ration . Rather , get L ? n used to one , and then do n't give tasty tidbits between meals , which help to spoil him . Dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to have for supper . They eat what is set before em , once they become accustomed to the taste . And they eat it quickly , too . A hungry dog has no trouble eating in one minute all the food he needs for a day . Do n't let your dog tell you what to feed him . Give him a complete ration and cake him like it . The patience you use In making this change will be repaid amply by the newly found convenience . asting is painless ? that is , reasonable - zing . A dog can go without eating for week and show no signs of any particular discomfort , provided he has all the water he wants . And certainly no dog would have to be starved that long to make him eat food that is good for him . FOR years I have tested dog foods . More than 200 brands have been ; : died for their biological value . Some the canned foods were very good . But ? far the best of all were some of the hydrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ed dog foods and meat either are , or n should be , out of the question for s to eat . The best buy and the best food I know ay for the home dog is one of the good ied dog foods with which you combine ut 20 percent of fat and then moisten mixture with water . The fat may be con drippings , steak fat , chicken fat ? y of the various fats found in the tchen of any home . If the government ides we must have those fats for war oses , then the best buy is that same ? without the fat . The second best buy is dog biscuits , ken , soaked , and mixed with table aps . This generally is not so sound diet as those dog foods planned to be plete ; but it is a means of getting by . e very fact that the manufacturers e owners to feed dogs table scraps is indication that these diets are inplete . Properly used , table scraps can be an cellent food for dogs . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog food . I count among table ps potatoes , cake , and other previy taboo foods we all used to think re poison to our pets . Once this new regime is begun , stick it rigidly and make it as uniform as ible . If table scraps are to be added , t use all chopped beef one meal and toes or rice the next ; mix the food well as you can , always endeavoring keep the dog from becoming finicky.
