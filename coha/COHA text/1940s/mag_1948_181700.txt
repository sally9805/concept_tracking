His father was sullen and cantankerous . " If that boy , " he fumed , " ever shows the first inclination towards music , or noises disguised as such , I will kill it . " Musical noises were just what the boy did incline to , and nothing his father said or did could stop him . On Sundays , his mousy spinster aunt sneaked him off to a church where he could hear an organ . By the time he was eleven , he was composing a church service every week ( " I used to write like the devil in those days , " he apologized later ) . He toured the petty courts of Italy and Germany , played for cardinals , dukes and princes . By the time he was 25 , George Frederick Handel was Hanover 's Kapellmeister and one of the most talked-about young musicians in Europe . <P> Last week , 189 years after his death , George Frederick Handel was more widely talked-about than ever . Sir Newman Flower 's revised edition of his scholarly George Frideric Handel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. ( Scribner ; $6 ) ; the late Romain Rolland 's Essays on Music ( Allen , Towne &; Heath ; $5 ) had a fat chapter on him . Handelian Robert Manson Myers had written a book-Handel 's Messiah , a Touchstone of Taste ( Macmillan ; $5 ) , out next week-on his greatest oratorio . Handel was not always so well treated in his own day . <P> Ocean of Neck . The London Handel moved to in 1712 was a bawdy place of brawling and bawling . Handel did well at court . Queen Anne , who had little use for musicians , pensioned him just to spite her Hanoverian cousins . Anne 's successor , lumpish George I , attended almost all his operas with his favorite German mistress and her " two acres of cheeks ... an ocean of neck . " The rest of London was more fickle . Addison , who had written an unsuccessful opera himself , denounced and ridiculed Handel 's music . Handel 's rival , the egocentric Giovanni Battista Bononcini , kept him fighting for audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the caperings of Handel 's two leading prima donnas , Faustina and Cuzzoni , than in his music . Almost nightly at the opera house , heads were bashed , windows smashed . The cheers &; jeers drowned out Handel 's arias , while the two " fighting cats " scratched at each other 's eyes and pulled at each other 's hair . <P> But Handel 's most powerful opponent was Frederick , Prince of Wales . He and his young friends , who scorned everything his father , George II , chose to favor , set up an Opera of the Nobility to rival Handel 's theater . Handel 's enemies organized bands of hoodlums to tear down his posters , gave parties on the nights of his oratorios to make sure no one would attend . Sometimes Handel played to nearly empty houses ( " My music will sound the better so ! " he snorted ) . Sometimes , the King and his party made up nearly the entire audience . Quipped Lord Chesterfield on leaving a concert early : " I thought it best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy . " <P> Tears of Appreciation . Through all those troubled years , Handel worked furiously . He could turn out operas , cantatas and oratorios in a matter of days . Refusing sleep and food , weeping copious tears over the beauties of his own inspiration , he composed the Messiah in 24 days .
