Big-league baseball last week got ready to open its 1943 season in the mood of tempered optimism of a batter running out a three-bagger with two out and a cross eyed player next at bat . Columnist Damon Runyon quoted odds of 9-to-5 that the major leagues would not be able to play out their 1943 schedules . Already some 225 of last year 's 400 major leaguers had gone into the services . Nobody , not even Manpower Boss Paul V. McNutt , knew how soon local draft boards would call the elderly and ailing ballplayers still left . <P> To replace box-office stars gone to war , every club had to load up with run-of-the-mill players brought up from the minors or oldsters rescued from oblivion . Cleveland Indians Manager Lou Boudreau had to put a sportswriter at third base to muster two teams for a practice game . The Giants desperately and futilely combed the field for a proper first baseman . The Brooklyn Dodgers congratulated themselves on having acquired one player ( Bobby Bragan ) who could double as catcher and shortstop , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pitcher , outfielder and first baseman . Said Chicago White Sox Manager Jimmie Dykes : " Any team that can keep nine men on the field will be dangerous . " <P> Hits Wanted . Sportswriters , to whom spring training is always a pleasant vacation , grumbled and groaned because the clubs trained in New Jersey , Indiana and other cold , rainy places instead of in Florida and California . But managers , with one eye on the business offices , found that northern training had many advantages : owners saved money , players got more exercise and avoided long , wearying barnstorming trips . <P> By last week the prospects were that for at least the first few months of the season baseball fans would see baseball much as usual . To compensate for an inevitable slump in the quality of play , the major leagues decided to restore the lively ball ( and home runs ) of 1939 . To cut travel , each team will make three trips around the league instead of four . To suit swing-shift workers , the clubs will consider playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still plenty of good copy for the sportswriters . Items : <P> &gt; In the Sporting News the St. Louis Cardinals , last year 's World Series winners , advertised for help : CARDINAL ORGANIZATION NEEDS PLAYERS ! <P> &gt; In Kansas City , Brooklyn Dodger Outfielder Frenchy Bordagaray , weakening on his decision to retire to tavern-keeping , advertised : " The Bums is calling me . For Sale - $12,000-a-year business - cheap ! " <P> &gt; In Lakewood , N. J. Giants Manager Mel Ott perked up when he heard that Selective Service doctors were hesitating about inducting First Baseman Johnny Mize . Observing that Mize had always bruised easily , Otto told newsmen : " He has a form of hemophilia-you know , excessive bleeding . " But Mize passed , was sent to the Navy . <P> &gt; In San Francisco , Umpire Hap O'Connor , who had umpired many baseball games in Japan , urged that baseball be continued to confound the Japs . Said he : " The Japs so envy us for our baseball prowess . . . that to call it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they would construe it to mean we were becoming panicky. "
