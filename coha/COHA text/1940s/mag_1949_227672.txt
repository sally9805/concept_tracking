SELLING The Old Fashioned-Way <P> To pep up sagging refrigerator sales this summer , Joske 's of Texas , a subsidiary of Allied Stores in San Antonio , went back to old-fashioned selling methods . Sales Promotion Vice President Jim Keenan plugged Frigidaires in splashy newspaper ads , cut out down payments and sent his 80 salesmen out to ring doorbells . Some used the old trick of following an ice wagon down the street to find householders still using iceboxes . One man stayed out so many nights selling that he finally decided to take his wife along : she talked to housewives while he cornered the husbands . <P> An added spur was a four weeks ' " Dress Yourself " contest . Salesmen got clothing prizes ( ties , shirts , etc. ) depending on what they sold , with the top prize a suit . At meetings once a week , salesmen could wear only what they had won . At the first meeting , some were barely decent . Last week . Joske 's totted up results of the contest . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits given out . Since the campaign started , Joske 's has sold $750,000 worth , more than most big stores sell in a year .
