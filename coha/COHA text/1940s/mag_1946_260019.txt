When young ( 36 ) Mario Lasso was Mexican consul general in Chicago , by appointment of his uncle , Foreign Minister Ezequiel Padilla , he took personal care of tourist-card applications filed by particularly pretty girls . That was how he met his second and present wife , tiny , blonde Flora Dancy , 24 , of Clinton , Ind. , whom he brought back to Mexico last fall when he returned to run Uncle Ezequiel 's presidential campaign . Says Flora of husband Mario : " Yes , a great wolf . " <P> Last week the great wolf was in a political trap . The police announced , after he had been missing four days , that they held Lasso as a confessed conspirator in a plot to kill President-elect Miguel Alemn and his prospective chief minister , Colonel Carlos I. Serrano . <P> Their story : one day an army officer reported that he was approached by a man who wanted to buy two grenades for " well-digging . " In no time the cops claimed to have caught him handing the grenades to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hired to use the grenades on Alemn and Serrano . Lasso , they said , also confessed after only a brief chat . <P> Then Ezequiel Padilla called in reporters . He showed them a penciled note allegedly smuggled out from the imprisoned Mario .

" Said Padilla : " The darkest chapter in Mexico 's history of iniquities . " Said Secret Police sub-Chief Jess Galindo of Mario 's blast : ' ' Nothing but lies . " <P> Padillistas cried that it was all a frame-up to take the public 's mind off the vote-counting frauds of which the opposition have complained .
