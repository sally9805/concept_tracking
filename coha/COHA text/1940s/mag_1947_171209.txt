Writing music ( unless you include Tin Pan Alley hits ) is no way to get rich quick . So it was news that a tall , gangling musician named Leroy Robertson had got $25,000 for a long-haired orchestra piece . Probably no piece of classical music had ever been so handsomely paid for. * The money Robertson got for his Trilogy would have supported Mozart or Schubert for life . <P> The $25,000 came from Detroit 's music lover Henry Reichhold , who runs the Detroit Symphony Orchestra . Reichhold 's publicity men snagged newspaper space by calling Prizewinner Robertson a cowboy-composer . Actually , though Robertson did herd sheep in Utah as a boy , he is a music professor at Brigham Young University , and winner of the New York Music Critics ' Circle award in 1944 for a string quartet . He had not even entered Reichhold 's contest : he sent the score , signed " Nostrebor " ( his name spelled backwards ) to his New York publisher , who entered it without Robertson 's knowledge . <P> Last week , Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to hear what all the money was spent for . The composer himself had explained his work : " If it is broad and sweeping , as the judges say it is , it comes from viewing the high plateaus of the Wasatch Range while tending sheep . . . . One passage sort of expresses the old-timers who spit tobacco into brass spittoons . . . . " But Trilogy had little picture painting about it : it was a well-knit if not wonderful symphony , with occasional ear-splitting eruptions of brass . Commented Detroit Critic Harvey Taylor : " Those 25 Gs could have fallen into much , much less able hands . " <P> <P> <P> * Verdi got $20,000 from the Khedive of Egypt for Ada , which was written for the opening of the Suez Canal . A Stalin Prize , first class , also pays about $20,000.
