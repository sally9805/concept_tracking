Counterattack ( adapted from the Russian of Ilya Vershinin and Mikhail Ruderman by Janet and Philip Stevenson ; produced by Lee Sabinson ) is a play about Russians and Nazis that could just as well be about cops &; robbers . For three acts a Russian corporal and private stand guard - in a claustrophobic cellar whose entrance caves in-over seven disarmed but wily Nazis and a German nurse . Because they can not find out which Nazi is the officer they have been ordered to bring back alive , the Russians must hold their rebellious , scheming prisoners rather than shoot them down . Since one Russian gets wounded and the other becomes wobbly from lack of sleep , this takes doing-the kind of doing , in fact , that made William S. Hart 's fortune . <P> Worthless as a picture of war , Counterattack does not quite make the grade as an out- &-out; thriller . It has goose-fleshy twists , but some of it is too old-fashioned and most of it is too unreal .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
