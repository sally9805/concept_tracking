Harry Truman 's abrupt termination of Lend-Lease ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) reverberated around the world . Most nations took it philosophically , but Britain was hurt and worried . The blow fell while Britain was tightening its belt against a winter of bleak prospects ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . <P> In the House of Commons , Prime Minister Clement Attlee , pale and plainly disquieted , officially broke the bad news , lamely admitted that Britain had not been prepared for it .

He had merely substituted one lending device for another . But the psychological effect of chopping off Lend-Lease was immense . The President had notified the world that the U.S. would not be played for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hard-headed Missourian who could be trusted to handle money in a businesslike way .
