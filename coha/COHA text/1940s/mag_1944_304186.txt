Every day some U.S. serviceman , coming out of battle or out of anesthesia , realizes that he is blind , that ahead of him stretches a lifetime of darkness . To the parents of one such blinded soldier Brigadier General Paul R. Hawley , chief U.S. Army surgeon for the European Theater , recently wrote a letter ( published in the New York Herald Tribune ) of classic directness . <P> " Your son has had his eyes seriously damaged in the war . . . . He has been confronted with the fear of blindness which he has faced with the same manly courage he had when wounded . . . . Everything possible has been done to save his sight , without success . <P> " The fear of blindness is a very real and ugly thing . Fear can only be overcome by understanding the thing that causes it . The fear of blindness is the fear of utter darkness , a physical darkness that leads to a darkness of the mind . It is also the fear . . . of helplessness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a fear of loneliness , of sentimental pity , of being placed by one 's friends in a world apart . <P> " We recognize and understand these fears and overcome them .

Haphazard and casual training in the home often does more harm than good . . . . <P> " The most important thing you can do when he returns is to treat him as naturally as you can . He does not want pity and sentimentality . He wants to do things for himself and the sooner he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Greet him as if nothing had happened . . . . <P> " I wish for you and for your son all success in your common task of overcoming his injury ; and overcome it you can if you refuse to be defeated . He was not afraid when he gave his eyes for his country . You must never let him be afraid while he is getting his vision back through other faculties . "
