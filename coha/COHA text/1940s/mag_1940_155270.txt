With Government Candidate Avila Camacho and Independent Juan Andreu Almazan both claiming they had won the July 7 Presidential election , both preparing to take office , both promising a full-dress Congress to support them , the lid last week suddenly popped off Mexican politics . <P> The first surprise was sprung by Alfredo Navarrete , general counsel of the Mexican Mine Workers Syndicate . Rugged , husky-voiced , audacious and experienced , Alfredo Navarrete is a conservative who is against political control of labor unions . He announced that his Syndicate , which claims 125,000 members , would break away from CTM ( Mexican Confederation of Labor ) and try to form a new Popular Front with 102,000 railway workers , 16,000 oil workers , 11,000 electrical workers , 8,000 sugar workers . He promised that his organization would be non-political and " free from radicalism " - free , that is , from the influence of Communists . Though there are only about 30,000 Communists in Mexico , the Party has had a big share in CTM counsels . <P> Next day , speaking in confidential tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminar , Foreign Editor Cesar Ortiz of the CTM organ El Popular made a fabulous charge . Conservative Candidate Almazan , he told them , is just a tool of exiled Leon Trotsky . Together , he confided to the educators , the two aimed " to wreck Mexico 's liberal education system . . . . Trotsky would like to go into the U. S. to destroy your institutions , also . . . exert his influence over all South America . You can count on that . " <P> President Cardenas moved the following day to cool off the labor revolt , which threatened to spread to Communist-dominated unions . He issued a stern ultimatum to workers on the railroads not to split from CTM . He warned oil workers that unless they reorganized the entire industry within a reasonable time , he would cut wages , drop bonuses and take " other steps to get the industry back on a paying basis . " The President 's warning went down badly and not only the oil and rail workers , but also Government employes in the communications services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pro-Government minds to Oppositionist Almazan . Naturally all the elements which oppose the imposition of Avila Camacho were willing to see the labor blow-up go sky high . And that was a danger last week . If labor fell down on the Government , the Government would have to fall back on the Army . Once again the six-year-old NEW Revolution wabbled between the mastery of the State and the labor unions . <P> Even in the Army , trouble brewed last week . It was revealed that certain soldiers of the 38th Infantry Battalion , strategically posted on the fringe of the Federal District , and others " in the country , " had been caught with " visiting cards " on which was printed the legend : " Soldiers , take arms against your usurpers when Almazan orders it . " <P> Where was Almazan ? When the answer became known , Camachistas made much of it . The man , they said , was craven , guilty , shameful . He was , in point of fact , sensible as a fox .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
