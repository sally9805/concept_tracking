China is still too busy pitting flesh &; blood against a mechanized enemy to set off any fanfares about her postwar business plans . But China is looking to the future . From Washington this week came news of one blueprint already completed : a full-blown , carefully planned program for a five-year plan of industrialization . <P> The program was drawn in the U.S. But it has already been examined and approved by 300 of her technicians and by Economic Minister Wong Wen-hao . It has also been O.K. 'd by Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek . <P> China 's plan was born late in 1943 , when Lauchlin Currie , then acting deputy administrator of the Foreign Economic Administration , sat down to discuss it with FEA 's electric , little , British-born chief engineer , Alex Taub . Taub had just completed a ten-year industrialization plan for Brazil . Said Currie : " China 's alive . Why not do one for China ? " <P> Canvass of Industry . Taub and his FEA engineers went to work , made their first stop in the front office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 52 basic industries , they posed this question : how much would it cost to put an economically feasible unit of your industry in China , capable of affecting China 's economy nationally ? <P> Such companies as Baldwin Locomotive Works , Giddings &; Lewis Machine Tool Co. , H. K. Ferguson Co. and American Cyanamid supplied FEA with detailed specifications . <P> The engineers knew what they wanted . They were seeking the basic , minimum parts of an integrated industrial system . Put together , the individual parts would give China a fundamental industrial plant from which greater variety and specialization could grow . <P> Broadly classified , the program was broken down by Taub 's engineers into six sections : <P> 1 ) Mining and Metallurgy ; <P> 2 ) Chemical and Basic Processing ; <P> 3 ) Manufacturing ; <P> 4 ) Processed Foods ; <P> 5 ) Agricultural Foods ; <P> 6 ) Commercial Power . The first five sections include 625 plants , commercial power accounts for another 260 units , laid out in detail . <P> Backbone of Steel . Under Taub 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blueprinted steel units . As planned , they will ultimately produce about 2% to 3% of the U.S. 1940 production of 67 million tons . All other industries are similarly designed to turn out about 2% of the production of their U.S. models . <P> When the plant system-steel and all-is in production , China will be able to manufacture an impressive range of products , e.g. , steel ingots , rolled shapes , aluminum , sulphuric acid , coal tar , alcohol , gasoline , fertilizers , electric motors , tires and tubes , light bulbs and bicycles . <P> Deliberately , Taub left transportation from the program , to be planned separately . But the industrial program provides for part of the equipment needed to expand transportation in China . The plan includes cement plants , locomotive and freight-car shops , and factories to make earth-moving equipment . It also plans to locate many industries at Jap-held centers like Peiping and Tientsin .
