Returning refreshed from Hyde Park , and no longer skittish about saying that he had been there ( see PRESS ) , Franklin Roosevelt plunged into a full week . <P> First he set out resolutely to repair some of the damage done to U.S.-French relations . Greeting a group of visiting French correspondents after his press conference , he spoke a few words of Rooseveltian French to them , then told them ( in Rooseveltian English ) how sorry he was he had not got to France on his way home from Yalta . In glowing terms , he recalled the days of his youth , when he had bicycled through the French countryside . <P> As the correspondents beamed , Franklin Roosevelt told them they should pay no attention to all those stories of friction between himself and General de Gaulle . After all , said the President , they were great friends . They had had a good time together in Washington last July , and it was only a matter of schedule that he had not got to France last month . The differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture , were no bigger than a fingernail . <P> The President also : <P> Had a visit from Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , gave him a full fill-in on Yalta ( see CANADA AT WAR ) . <P> Greeted a dozen of the lean young U.S. Army Rangers who carried out the liberation at Cabanatuan . <P> Pinned yet another Gold Star , in lieu of a third D.S.M. , on famed Admiral " Bull " Halsey . <P> Took part in various conferences concerning the forthcoming Pacific command . <P> And , never too busy to politick , conferred with Democratic National Chairman Bob Hannegan and New York State Chairman Paul Fitzpatrick on the 1946 New York gubernatorial election , still 19 months away . The conversation apparently was heady . Emerging from the White House , Chairman Fitzpatrick made a bold prediction : if Tom Dewey runs for reelection in 1946 , he will be defeated .
