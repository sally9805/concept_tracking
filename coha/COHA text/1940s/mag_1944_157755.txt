The Whitemarsh Mystery <P> What was going on at Whitemarsh ? <P> Ever since Morgan Partner Edward T. Stotesbury died in 1938 , Whitemarsh Hall , his 145-room country house , north of Philadelphia 's swank suburban Chestnut Hill , had stood empty and unlived in . In the winter of 1942 it became a place of mystery . Passers-by reported strange doings . Around the vast , Versailles-inspired mansion a high steel fence went up . By day armed guards patrolled the herbaceous borders . By night great floodlights on the parapets sometimes flashed on to light up Whitemarsh Hall 's massive , two-story limestone facade and Ionic columns . <P> Rumors flew : Whitemarsh Hall was a fancy concentration camp for Axis diplomatic prisoners ; it was an Army asylum for the insane . <P> Last week the mystery was dispelled . Whitemarsh Hall had been the hideaway for the priceless art treasures of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum . <P> Far from the Madding Bombs . In the feverish days after Pearl Harbor , when plane watchers on Manhattan 's skyscrapers scanned the skies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Museum officials feverishly sought some shelter where their millions of dollars ' worth of art would be safe from Nazi bombs . Even earlier , various vacant buildings in Westchester and Putnam Counties had been inspected and found wanting . An abandoned shale mine near Kingston seemed safe but too damp . At last a Metropolitan trustee suggested Whitemarsh Hall . <P> Into Whitemarsh Hall , with its 45 bathrooms , moved the Metropolitan 's Building Superintendent William Chapman . Into special vans went 90 loads of crated , padded masterpieces and objets d'art . In case of accidents , no van carried more than a million-dollar load . But the secret , heavily guarded trips proved uneventful . <P> Venus and 13 Bachelors . Soon some 450 great paintings were racked on pipeline scaffolds set up in the huge , thermostated hall where Financier Stotesbury once gave concerts for 1,000 guests . Among the hidden paintings were ten Rembrandts , Breugel 's Harvesters , El Greco 's View of Toledo , Titian 's Venus and the Lute Player , Vermeer 's Lady with the Lute , Daumier 's Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spate of Italian primitives , twelve Sargents , twelve Winslow Homers . The priceless Svres porcelains were never unpacked . The medieval tapestries stayed on their long rollers . All were guarded by an electric signal system wired to a specially installed power plant in the house . They were also guarded by 13 picked Metropolitan staff members , all family men doomed to temporary bachelorhood , who moved into the former servants ' wing . The only servants were one cook , one maid . <P> Feeling a good deal like Siberian exiles , the museum men whiled away the long , blitzless days by whamming golf balls across the manicured terraces or romping with a police dog named Peggy . Drinking was strictly forbidden . <P> Then one day last year word came that the danger was over . The piecemeal return to Manhattan began .
