" Italian planes successfully raided Gibraltar and all machines returned to Italy safely after sinking three British destroyers and leaving half of the Rock in flames following a petrol dump explosion . " <P> Mightily surprised were Gibraltar residents , who had seen neither planes nor bombs , to hear this announcement over the Rome radio . Not surprised , but mad clear through , were the people of La Linea , just over the Spanish boundary , when they tuned it in . Early the same morning unidentified planes had swooped over the Spanish town , bombed several houses to bits , killed eight of the townspeople , wounded 19 . <P> Since La Lnea had no destroyers to sink or petrol dumps to burn , for once the world had a gauge of the accuracy of Italian Air Force communiqus.
