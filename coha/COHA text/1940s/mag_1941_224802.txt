In the antlike studios of Walt Disney Productions Ltd. at Burbank , Calif. , Phil Dike is one of the more important ants . He is Disney 's ace color coordinator . On the side , he paints water colors of his own . Last week Phil Dike had a one-man show at Manhattan 's Ferargil Galleries . Technically expert , untroubled by surrealist neuroses , social struggle or pneumatic nudes , Dike 's splashy water colors of mountains , windswept beaches , palm-plumed countryside were sometimes reminiscent of Japanese landscape prints , were as brightly lush as a Montecito bougainvillea . <P> Ash-blond , store-clerkish , 34-year-old Phil Dike , son of a California real-estate promoter , started his art career by imitating his grandmother , who used to paint reproductions of picture postcards . At 21 , he won a medal in a local watercolor exhibition , shipped off to Manhattan , where he studied with oldtime U. S. Realist George Luks . After a spell in Paris and Italy , mostly sitting in cafs and talking , Dike returned to Southern California , settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to teach drawing and composition in the training school on the Disney lot , soon promoted him to the job of color coordinator . His main job : matching Technicolor reproductions with original colored sketches made by other Disney artists . When Disney went to work on his artistically ambitious Fantasia , Phil Dike made sketches for Toccata &; Fugue , Night on Bald Mountain , Ave Maria . <P> Artist Dike is not even tempted to bite the hand that feeds him . He thinks Disney 's Night on Bald Mountain " the most mature statement " ever made in animated cartoons , believes that Disney 's mouse-opera presents a great future for artists-perhaps the missing link between the artist and the public . Says he : " You feel as though you were part of something pretty big and important when you work on a Disney film . One of the greatest things Disney offers an artist is the discipline of having to sell his stuff by making definite and specific statements in simple , uncomplicated language , pictorially speaking . <P> It s an obvious fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger influence than the single picture exhibited in some museum . I 'm not ready to say that a Disney film is better than a Rembrandt or vice versa . This business is really too young to tell much yet as to how far an artist can go if he makes a career of it . I 'm inclined to think , however , that in time artists will be developed in this field who will be just as great as some of the past masters whom we use now as source material .
