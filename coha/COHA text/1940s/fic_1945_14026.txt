Lights cigarette , and cogitates moodily . ) EDDIE BROCK ( Pointing to document . ) Here , too ? ED DEVERY Yes . EDDIE BROCK ( Looking up at DEVERY , offended . ) Since when I 'm only the Vice-President ? ED DEVERY You 're slipping . EDDIE BROCK I used to be the whole President . Right ?

She has to have a great many things explained to her . I wo n't be around enough , and even if I were , I could n't do it . No patience . Too old and I do n't know enough myself .

( To PAUL . ) She 's a hell of a good kid . You 'll like ' er . ( BILLIE comes out onto landing , brushing hair . She wears a resplendent negligee , which reveals and explains much . Almost anyone could succeed in it . PAUL rises . ) BILLIE DAWN ( A tone of complaint . ) I 'm gettin ' dressed . ( Stops as she sees PAUL . ) HARRY BROCK It 's all right . It 's all right .

ED DEVERY Sure . HARRY BROCK Bring the stuff . ( BROCK looks at PAUL , cheers him on with a fisted gesture of confidence . DEVERY picks up brief-case , follows BROCK out of room . A long pause . BILLIE is seemingly disinterested and unconcerned . PAUL is wondering how to begin . He can not imagine . Finally : ) PAUL VERRALL Your  --  friend Mr. Brock has an idea he 'd like us to spend a little time together . You and me , that is . BILLIE DAWN ( Without looking at him . ) You do n't say . PAUL VERRALL Yes . BILLIE DAWN ( Turning to PAUL . ) What 're you ? Some kind of a gigolo ? PAUL VERRALL ( Smiling . ) Not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the idea ? PAUL VERRALL Nothing special .

PAUL VERRALL Do that . BILLIE DAWN Since I was very small I never say it . We had this teacher . She used to slug you if you did it . PAUL VERRALL Did what ? BILLIE DAWN Said " ai n't . " PAUL VERRALL Oh . BILLIE DAWN So I got outa the habit . PAUL VERRALL You think it was worth the slugging ? BILLIE DAWN Well , not hard . PAUL VERRALL It 's the principle of the thing . There 's too much slugging . I do n't believe in it . BILLIE DAWN ( Aping his seriousness . ) All right , I do n't believe in it , either . p. 77 PAUL VERRALL Good . BILLIE DAWN ( Softly , leaning toward him with a smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL VERRALL ( Smiling . ) You 're great , Miss Dawn . BILLIE DAWN ( Correcting him . ) Billie . PAUL VERRALL Billie .

BILLIE DAWN ( Has to think a moment before she can answer . ) My God !  --  Emma . PAUL VERRALL What 's the matter ? BILLIE DAWN Do I look to you like an Emma ? PAUL VERRALL No . You do n't look like a Billie , either . BILLIE DAWN So what do I look like ? PAUL VERRALL To me ? BILLIE DAWN Yuh , to you . PAUL VERRALL You look like a little angel . ( A pause. ) p. 78 BILLIE DAWN Lemme ask you  --  ( Looks at BROCK 'S door , then leans toward PAUL . ) Are you one of these talkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL VERRALL ( Amazed . ) Huh ? BILLIE DAWN I got a yen for you right off . PAUL VERRALL Do you get many ? BILLIE DAWN Now and then . PAUL VERRALL What do you do about them ? BILLIE DAWN ( Invitingly . ) Stick around . You 'll find out . PAUL VERRALL All right , I will . BILLIE DAWN And if you want a tip , I 'll tell you . Sweet talk me . I like it . Like that angel line . ( PAUL looks upstairs , rises . ) Do n't worry about him . He do n't see a thing . He 's too dizzy from bein ' a big man . PAUL VERRALL ( Crossing L. to back of sofa . ) This is going to be a little different than I thought . BILLIE DAWN ( Leaning back . ) You mind ? PAUL VERRALL ( Hands on back of sofa , bends to her . His tie hangs down . ) No. p. 79 BILLIE DAWN ( Playing with his tie . ) It 's only fair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walks R. around sofa . BILLIE sits up , faces him . ) PAUL VERRALL ( Weakly attempting to get on safer ground . ) Now , about those books . BILLIE DAWN Yes ? PAUL VERRALL I 'll get them for you tomorrow . I 'll look around my place , too . If there 's anything interesting , I 'll drop it by later . BILLIE DAWN All right . PAUL VERRALL We can figure out time every day the day before . BILLIE DAWN ( Beckons to HIM . HE bends over , but not far enough . SHE hooks her finger into his breast pocket , draws him closer . ) Or the night ! PAUL VERRALL Sure . ( BROCK and DEVERY appear . PAUL and BILLIE separate quickly . BROCK wears a foulard lounging jacket . ) HARRY BROCK Well . You two gon na get together ? PAUL VERRALL ( Looking at BILLIE . ) I think we 're all set . p. 80 HARRY BROCK Great ! Great ! ( DEVERY picks up his hat . ) PAUL VERRALL ( Starting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  HARRY BROCK Have a drink . PAUL VERRALL No , thanks . ED DEVERY ( Leaving . ) See you tomorrow , Harry . HARRY BROCK Right . ED DEVERY Good-night , Billie . BILLIE DAWN So long . ( DEVERY leaves , closing door . ) PAUL VERRALL ( To BILLIE . ) Good-night . HARRY BROCK ( Following PAUL . On second step C. THEY shake hands . ) So long , kid . Appreciate it . PAUL VERRALL ( Still shaking hands . A look at BILLIE . ) So do I. BILLIE DAWN ( Tantalizingly . ) So long , kid ! ( PAUL leaves . BROCK comes back into room , standing below stairs . Alone now for the first time in the play , it is obvious that they have nothing whatever to say to one another . However , there are ways and ways of social intercourse . We are about to see one of the most common . BROCK takes a Gin Rummy kit two decks of cards  --  pencil  --  score pad from pocket of his robe , goes into action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BILLIE takes cigarettes , comes over to table , cuts cards . HE cuts , THEY compare . SHE slams hers down . HE does same . BROCK puts phone on floor , sits R. of table . Shuffles , then deals two hands of Gin Rummy . BILLIE goes to mix drinks , comes back to table , sets them down . BROCK , arranging his hand , draws cards to his breast with a jerk , with the alertness of one who has been bitten and is twice shy . BILLIE sits , tears out top page of score pad , drops it in ashtray . SHE pushes her bracelet up on her arm and straightens her hair . SHE begins to sort her cards . You get the idea that this is their nightly routine . BROCK downs his drink , a straight shot of rye . BILLIE arranges her cards swiftly and at length , giving the unmistakable impression of many sets , a fine hand . BROCK watches her with something less than patience . Finally , when SHE is ready , game begins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment . SHE discards . BROCK can not use it , picks one from deck . HE looks at it , discards it . BILLIE scoops it up . SHE discards , then rearranges her hand , having obviously completed a run . BROCK notes this , unhappily , picks another card from deck , puts it down . BILLIE again scoops his discard . SHE moves two cards over to it , completing another run , then discards . BROCK , simmering , picks up another card from deck . His inefficient poker face breaks into a smile as he finds he can use it . HE discards . BILLIE , as though it were coming to her , picks it up and after a pause , during which SHE sits motionless , discards . BROCK starts to draw. ) p. 81 BILLIE DAWN ( A high note . ) Gin ! ( BROCK pulls back his hand quickly . SHE lays out her hand . BROCK scores his . ) HARRY BROCK ( Mumbling . ) Forty-one . ( BILLIE shoves cards to BROCK , picks . ) Forty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her drink . HE shuffles , cuts , hands her the pack . HE takes cigarette , lights it . SHE deals slowly , moving her lips as she counts inaudibly . THEY pick up their cards and play . BROCK discards first . BILLIE draws , discards . BROCK draws again . ) If you pay attention , that Verrall guy can do you some good . BILLIE DAWN ( Not looking up . ) All right . ( Draws and discards . ) HARRY BROCK ( Draws . ) You 're in the Big League now . I want you to watch your step . ( Discards . ) BILLIE DAWN ( Still absorbed in game . ) All right . ( Draws and discards . BROCK draws and discards. ) p. 82 HARRY BROCK You got ta learn to fit in . If not , I ca n't have you around , and that 's no bull . ( A pause , as THEY play . BILLIE draws and discards . ) You got ta be careful what you do . ( Draws and discards . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discard . ) Three ! ( Lays out her hand . ) HARRY BROCK ( Scores his cards . Lays one off on her hand . ) Twenty-eight . BILLIE DAWN ( Pencil poised , ready to score . SHE wants to hear him say it again . ) Twenty-eight ? HARRY BROCK ( Too clearly . ) Twenty-eight ! ( BILLIE shoves cards to BROCK for him to shuffle . SHE starts to score . Arithmetic is not her strong point , so using her L. hand , on which SHE is resting her head , SHE counts with her fingers , tapping them in sequence against her forehead . In this way , SHE achieves total , scores it , then leans back . ) BILLIE DAWN You could use a little education yourself , if you ask me . HARRY BROCK Who asked you ? p. 83 BILLIE DAWN Nobody . HARRY BROCK So shut up ! ( Hands cards over . BILLIE deals , her annoyance speeding tempo , and again counting inaudibly . When she has finished , she slams down remainder of deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play your cards . ( Pause . SHE begins to sort cards . ) BILLIE DAWN ( Loudly . ) It 's a free country . HARRY BROCK ( Discards . ) That 's what you think . ( A pause . BILLIE starts to sing " Anything Goes , " without words . Her memory of the song includes the orchestration , complete with breaks , trumpet figures and percussion . SHE gets through sixteen bars , BROCK becoming increasingly annoyed . HE has picked up a card , but her singing has so disconcerted him that HE can not make a decision . ) BILLIE DAWN ( Imitating muted trumpet . ) Tyah  --  dah  --  ! HARRY BROCK ( Yelling . ) Do you mind ? ( Looks first at his card , then at his hand , discards. ) p. 84 BILLIE DAWN ( Picking up his discard . ) Gin . ( SHE lays out her hand , as BROCK begins to resemble the King of Diamonds . ) HARRY BROCK ( Scores his cards . ) Thirty-four . BILLIE DAWN ( Ready with pencil as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAWN ( Scores , as before , as HE shuffles , then with a smile and a shout . ) Schneider ! HARRY BROCK ( Stops shuffling . ) Where do you get the schneid ? ( BILLIE twists score-pad around to prove it . ) BILLIE DAWN Fifty-five dollars . And sixty cents . HARRY BROCK ( Petulantly . ) All right , that 's all ! ( BROCK throws down cards , rises . Crosses to sideboard , pours drink . ) BILLIE DAWN Pay me now . HARRY BROCK ( Yelling . ) What the hell 's the matter ? Do n't you trust me ? BILLIE DAWN What are you hollerin ' ? You always make me pay . p. 85 HARRY BROCK ( Annoyed . ) Christ sake ! BILLIE DAWN ( Taunting him in sing-song . ) Sore loser ! HARRY BROCK Shut up ! BILLIE DAWN ( With perfect , ladylike control . ) Fifty-five dollars and sixty cents . ( HE comes down to table , takes large roll of bills from his pocket , pays off fifty-five dollars . HE starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pained , but resigned to defeat , HE counts out change , two quarters and a dime , tosses them to her across table . SHE slaps each one into possession . ) Thanks . ( HE starts for staircase , stops directly behind BILLIE , looks down at her with predatory eyes . ) HARRY BROCK Come on up . BILLIE DAWN ( Casually . ) In a minute . ( BROCK starts up stairs . ) HARRY BROCK ( Stops on second step . ) Now ! ( This is the one moment in their daily life of which Billie is boss . BOTH recognize the fact . ) BILLIE DAWN ( In charge . ) In a minute , I told you ! ( SHE riffles cards . BROCK goes up quietly , shuts door . BILLIE moves her winnings to one side , clears table in front of her and lays out a hand of solitaire . She sings , softly , as before , and plays in time to music . This time we hear the lyrics , as they were carefully coached into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockingWas looked on as something shocking But now Lord knows ( tyah dah ) Anything Goes ( tata tata  --  tata tata  --  tzing ! ) Good authors , too , who once  --  " ( Door buzzer sounds .

I just never understand it . So what 's the sense ? PAUL VERRALL Tell you what you do . You look through these . ( HE gives her newspapers . ) Anything you do n't understand , make a mark .

PAUL VERRALL ( Adding books . ) And I thought you might like these . BILLIE DAWN I 'll try . ( SHE puts books and newspapers on top of bookcase . ) PAUL VERRALL No , do n't do that . Just start reading . If you do n't like it , stop . Start something else . BILLIE DAWN ( Coming back to him . ) There 's only one thing . My eye-sight is n't so hot . PAUL VERRALL Well , why do n't you wear glasses ? BILLIE DAWN ( Aghast . ) Glasses ! PAUL VERRALL Why not ? BILLIE DAWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other for a time . SHE notices his glasses , but can not think of anything to say that will soften her remark . SHE moves in closer to him . Then closer still . It is as though they were about to dance . SHE leans toward him . Now THEY are touching . All at once THEY melt into an embrace , and kiss . A long expert kiss . THEY come out of it . BILLIE continues , casually . ) Of course , they 're not so bad on men . p. 88 PAUL VERRALL ( Softly . ) Good-night , Billie . BILLIE DAWN Good-night .

About two months have passed . The room looks live in . A desk has replaced table R.C.

In record rack on upstage end of Capehart are three large Red Seal records and some smaller ones . AT RISE : It is early evening and BILLIE , wearing slacks , blouse , robe and eyeglasses , is sitting on sofa reading front page of Washington Post . She opens paper and lifts it high to continue her reading . Front page of paper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper has the measles . She puts paper down and stretches , takes off glasses and puts them on coffee table , then gets up and walks across room to Capehart . SHE limps in an odd way , indicating that her leg has gone to sleep . At Capehart she selects three large records from record rack , holding them , one by one , close to her eyes in an effort to make out titles . Her nose touches record each time . She places records in instrument , starts it and walks back across room as music starts to play softly . The recording is of Jascha Heifetz playing the andante movement of the Concerto in D Minor for Violin and Orchestra , Op. 47 , by Jan Sibelius . She sits , puts on glasses again , picks up newspaper , starts to read . Before long she comes across a point she does not understand . She takes red pencil from glass and begins to mark paper . Buzzer sounds . EDDIE comes into room from service wing , wearing his hat , as always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakes head sympathetically and continues to door , opening it to admit PAUL . At sound of his voice , BILLIE smiles , puts down paper , whips off glasses and puts them on end table . PAUL VERRALL How are you , Eddie ? p. 90 EDDIE BROCK Great . PAUL VERRALL ( To BILLIE . ) Hello , smarty-pants . ( EDDIE returns to service wing . ) BILLIE DAWN Hello . PAUL VERRALL ( Moving to her . ) How you coming ? BILLIE DAWN Not so bad . PAUL VERRALL ( Teacher to pupil . ) Hm ? BILLIE DAWN  --  ly . Badly . ( PAUL laughs . ) Would you like some tea ? PAUL VERRALL ( Sitting on sofa . ) No thanks . ( Listens to music . ) Nice , that . BILLIE DAWN Sibelius , opp Forty-seven . ( She pronounces it Sy-beel-ious. THEY listen together for a moment . ) Guess who I just had for tea ? To tea ? PAUL VERRALL Who ? BILLIE DAWN ( Impressively . ) Mrs. Hedges . PAUL VERRALL Really ? How was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's pretty stupid , too  --  but in a refined sort of a way . Of course , we did n't have very much to talk about  --  so then she happened to notice my book laying there  --   --  p. 91 PAUL VERRALL Lying . BILLIE DAWN  --  my book lying there , and she says , " Oh , I 've been meaning to read that again for years ! " PAUL VERRALL What was it ? BILLIE DAWN ( Matter-of-fact . ) David Copperfield . PAUL VERRALL Oh yes . BILLIE DAWN So then we got to talking about it , and you want to know something ? PAUL VERRALL What ? BILLIE DAWN ( Telling a secret . ) She 's never read it at all ! PAUL VERRALL How do you know ? BILLIE DAWN I could tell from the way we were talking . PAUL VERRALL that surprise you ? BILLIE DAWN What , that she never read it ? PAUL VERRALL Yes . BILLIE DAWN No . PAUL VERRALL Then what ? BILLIE DAWN Well , why should she make out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . PAUL VERRALL Everybody does that , more or less . p. 92 BILLIE DAWN Do you ? PAUL VERRALL Sometimes . BILLIE DAWN I do n't . PAUL VERRALL I know , Billie . You 're an honest one . BILLIE DAWN Thanks . I 'm glad I got something from two months of this . ( WAITER enters from service wing , crosses to coffee table . Picks up tray , revealing letter which lies under it . ) PAUL VERRALL You did n't get that from me , I 'm afraid . ( WAITER starts to go . ) BILLIE DAWN I 'm not so sure . PAUL VERRALL ( Prompting . ) Thank you . BILLIE DAWN ( Pleasantly . ) You 're welcome . PAUL VERRALL ( Indicating WAITER . ) No , no . BILLIE DAWN Oh  --  ( Calling to WAITER . ) Thank you ! ( WAITER turns , bows , leaves . BILLIE picks up letter from coffee table , looks at it . ) I got this letter today . From my father . PAUL VERRALL New York ? BILLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 93 PAUL VERRALL Why ? BILLIE DAWN Well , it 's the first time he ever wrote me in about eight years . We had a fight , sort of . He did n't want me to go with Harry . PAUL VERRALL What does he do ? BILLIE DAWN My father ? PAUL VERRALL Yes . BILLIE DAWN Gas Company . He used to read meters , but in this letter he says how he ca n't get around so good any more so they gave him a different job . Elevator man . ( A pause , as she remembers back . Music is still playing . She continues with a little smile of instinctive affection . ) Goofy old guy . He used to take a little frying pan to work every morning and a can of Sterno and cook his own lunch . He said everybody should have a hot lunch . ( Another pause . ) I swear I do n't know how he did it . There were four of us . Me and my three brothers and he had to do everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to feed us and give us a bath  --  buy our clothes . Everything . That 's why all my life I used to think how some day I 'd like to pay him back . Funny how it worked out . One night , I brought home a hundred dollars and I gave it to him . You know what he did ? He threw it in the toilet and pulled the chain . I thought he was going to hit me , sure , but he did n't . In his whole life , he never hit me once . p. 94 PAUL VERRALL ( Carefully . ) How 'd he happen to write you ? I mean , after all this time ? BILLIE DAWN Because I wrote him . PAUL VERRALL Oh . BILLIE DAWN He says he 's thought about me every day . God . I have n't thought about him , I bet , once even , in five years . That 's nothin ' against him . I have n't thought of anything . PAUL VERRALL nice to see him , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should write him again and I should have a hot lunch everyday and I should let him know how I am but that he did n't want to see me if I was still living the life of a concubine I looked it up ! He always used to say : " Do n't ever do nothin ' you would n't want printed on the front page of the New York Times . " ( A pause . ) Hey ! I just realized I 've practically told you the whole story of my life by now practically . ( Puts letter back on coffee table . ) PAUL VERRALL enjoyed it very much . BILLIE DAWN ( Settling back . ) How about the story of your life ? PAUL VERRALL Oh no . It 's too long  --  and mostly untrue . ( THEY smile at each other . ) What 'd you do this morning ? p. 95 BILLIE DAWN ( Brightening ) Oh , I went to the newsreel and then over to the National Gallery like you said . ( SHE rises . Takes letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL VERRALL How was it ? BILLIE DAWN Wonderful Quiet and peaceful and so interesting and did you ever notice ? It smells nice . ( PAUL smiles . ) It does . PAUL VERRALL How long 'd you stay ? BILLIE DAWN ( Putting letter in desk drawer . ) Couple hours . I 'm goin ' again . PAUL VERRALL Good . BILLIE DAWN Only the next time I wish you could come along . PAUL VERRALL All right . BILLIE DAWN ( Crossing C. ) Boy , there 's sure some things there that could use some explaining . ( Sibelius music ends . A moment of silence , then the lovely strains of " On Hearing The First Cuckoo of Spring , " by Delius , are heard . ) Oh , and you know what else I did today ? I went down to Brentano 's and I just walked around , like you said I should , and I looked at all the different kinds of books , and then the ones I thought maybe I 'd like to read I took . p. 96 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pretty soon I had a whole big pile , too big to carry , even . So I stopped . And I thought , my God , it 'll take me about a year to read this many ! So then I looked around , and compared to all the books there , my little pile was like nothing . So then I realized that even if I read my eyes out till the day I die I could n't even make a little dent in that one store . Next thing you know I bust out cryin ' . ( Crosses L. behind couch . ) PAUL VERRALL ( Rising , crossing R. to desk . ) Nobody reads everything . BILLIE DAWN They do n't ? PAUL VERRALL Of course not . BILLIE DAWN ( Moving around to front of sofa and sitting . ) I sure been tryin to . PAUL VERRALL ( Looking through a copy of New Republic. ) do n't suppose you got a chance to read my piece ? BILLIE DAWN What 're you talkin ' ? Of course I did . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think ? BILLIE DAWN ( Slowly and deliberately . ) Well , I think it 's the best thing I ever read . I did n't understand one word ! ( PAUL turns to place and looks at it. ) p. 97 PAUL VERRALL What did n't you understand ? BILLIE DAWN None of it . PAUL VERRALL ( Beckoning BILLIE to desk ; holding copy out to her . ) Here , show me what . ( BILLIE rises , puts on glasses as she goes to desk . PAUL laughs . SHE stops . ) BILLIE DAWN What 's so funny ? That I 'm blind practically ? PAUL VERRALL Practically blind . BILLIE DAWN ( Continuing to desk. )  --  practically blind ? PAUL VERRALL You 're wonderful . BILLIE DAWN ( At desk , stiffly . ) I 'm sorry I look funny to you . PAUL VERRALL You do n't . They make you look lovelier than ever . BILLIE DAWN ( Sitting at desk . ) You sound like one of them ads for eye-glasses . ( SHE puts her attention on article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine in front of her . ) What ? BILLIE DAWN Well , like the name of it . " The Yellowing Democratic Manifesto . " p. 98 PAUL VERRALL Simple . BILLIE DAWN To who ? Whom . Whom ? Well , anyway , not to me . PAUL VERRALL Well , look . You know what yellowingmeans ? BILLIE DAWN Not this time . PAUL VERRALL ( Trying to explain . ) When a piece of paper gets old , what happens to it ? ( BILLIE thinks . ) BILLIE DAWN Throw it away ? PAUL VERRALL No , it turns yellow . BILLIE DAWN It does ? PAUL VERRALL Of course . BILLIE DAWN What do you know ! PAUL VERRALL Now , democratic . You know what that means , do n't you ? BILLIE DAWN ( Nodding . ) Not Republican . PAUL VERRALL Well , not exactly . It just means pertaining to our form of Government , which is a democracy . BILLIE DAWN ( Understanding . ) Oh . ( A pause . ) What 's pertaining ? PAUL VERRALL ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 99 BILLIE DAWN ( Musing . ) Pertaining . Nice word . ( Writes it down . ) PAUL VERRALL All right , now  --  manifesto ? BILLIE DAWN I do n't know . PAUL VERRALL Why did n't you look it up ? BILLIE DAWN I did look it up . I still do n't know . PAUL VERRALL Well , look  --   --  when I say manifesto , I mean the set of rules and ideals and  --   --  principles and hopes on which the United States is based . BILLIE DAWN And you think it 's turning yellow ? PAUL VERRALL Well , yes . I think that a lot of the original inspiration 's been neglected  --  and forgotten . BILLIE DAWN And that 's bad ? PAUL VERRALL And that 's bad . ( SHE thinks it over for a moment , hard . We can almost see it soaking in . SHE looks at magazine again . ) BILLIE DAWN ( Reading . ) " Even a cursory ? ( Looks up at PAUL , who nods ) examination of contemporary society in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation  --  of its parts , sends one immediately  --  to the consideration of the individual  --  as a citizen and the citizen as an individual . " p. 100 PAUL VERRALL Well  --   --  ? BILLIE DAWN ( Exasperated . ) I looked up every word ! PAUL VERRALL ( Closer to her . ) Listen  --  thousands of years ago , a Greek philosopher  --  ( HE pauses to make sure she is following. )  --  said that the world could only be as good as the people who lived in it . ( BILLIE thinks this over . ) BILLIE DAWN ( Generously . ) Makes sense . PAUL VERRALL All right . So I said , you take one look at America today and right away you figure you better take a look at the people in it . One by one , sort of . BILLIE DAWN Yuh ? PAUL VERRALL That 's all . BILLIE DAWN ( Pointing to article . ) That 's this ? PAUL VERRALL Sure . BILLIE DAWN Well , why did n't you say so ? PAUL VERRALL ( Crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( HE turns to her . ) I better do that piece again . Plainer . ( HE sits on R. arm of sofa . The music changes to a violin recording of " The Maid With The Flaxen Hair " by Debussy. ) p. 101 BILLIE DAWN Oh , and you know that thing you gave me about Napoleon ? PAUL VERRALL No , what ? BILLIE DAWN By Robert G. Ingersoll ? PAUL VERRALL Oh , yes . BILLIE DAWN Well , I 'm not sure if I get that either . PAUL VERRALL No deep meaning there . BILLIE DAWN There must be . He says about how he goes and looks in Napoleon 's tomb . PAUL VERRALL Yuh . BILLIE DAWN And he thinks of Napoleon 's whole sad life . PAUL VERRALL Yuh . BILLIE DAWN And then in the end he says he himself would 've rather been a happy farmer . PAUL VERRALL ( Quoting softly ) "  --  and I said I would rather have been a French peasant and worn wooden shoes . I would rather have lived in a hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes growing purple in the kisses of the autumn sun . " ( Continuing , rises and crosses D.C to R. of desk . ) " I would rather have been that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side , knitting as the day died out of the sky  --   --  with my children upon my knee and their arms about me  --   --  I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless silence of the dreamless dust , than to have been that imperial impersonation of force and murder , known as Napoleon the Great . " p. 102 BILLIE DAWN ( Awed . ) How can you remember all that stuff ? ( As PAUL starts to sit R. of desk , HE is startled , and so is BILLIE , by a burst from the Capehart . Debussy has been followed by the hysterical opening of T. Dorsey 's recording of " Well , Get It ! " It rides . BILLIE rushes over and turns it off . SHE crosses back to desk , glancing at PAUL in apologetic embarrassment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PAUL VERRALL ( Laughing . ) Do n't try so hard , Billie . Please . You miss the whole point . BILLIE DAWN Well , I like to like what 's better to like . PAUL VERRALL There 's room for all sorts of things in you . The idea of learning is to be bigger , not smaller . BILLIE DAWN ( Seriously . ) You think I 'm gettin ' bigger ? PAUL VERRALL Certainly . BILLIE DAWN Glad to hear it . ( Sits at desk and picks up the thread of their talk . ) So he would rather been a happy peasant than to be Napoleon . So who would n't ? PAUL VERRALL So Harry would n't , for one . p. 103 BILLIE DAWN What makes you think not ? PAUL VERRALL Ask him . BILLIE DAWN ( A shrug . ) He probably never heard of Napoleon . PAUL VERRALL What 's worse , he probably never heard of a peasant . BILLIE DAWN You hate him like poison ? PAUL VERRALL Who , Harry ? BILLIE DAWN Yuh . PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? PAUL VERRALL No . ( Rises and crosses C. , below desk . ) BILLIE DAWN Account of me and him ? PAUL VERRALL One reason . There are lots more . BILLIE DAWN What ? PAUL VERRALL ( C. , turning to her . ) Think about it . You 'll see that Harry is a menace . BILLIE DAWN He 's not so bad . I 've seen worse . PAUL VERRALL ( A step R.C. ) Has he ever done anything for anyone , except himself ? p. 104 BILLIE DAWN Me . PAUL VERRALL What ? BILLIE DAWN Well , I got two mink coats . PAUL VERRALL That was a trade . You gave him something , too . ( An awkward pause before BILLIE replies , very quietly . ) BILLIE DAWN ( With rare dignity . ) Do n't get dirty you 're supposed to be so wonderful so do n't get dirty ! PAUL VERRALL Has he ever thought about anybody but himself ? BILLIE DAWN Who does ? PAUL VERRALL ( With increasing fervor and volume , crossing to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned history of the world is a story of the struggle between the selfish and the unselfish ! BILLIE DAWN ( Quietly . ) I can hear you . PAUL VERRALL ( Patiently . ) All the bad around us is bred by selfishness . Sometimes selfishness even gets to be a cause , an organized force , even a government . Then it 's called Fascism . Can you understand that ? BILLIE DAWN Sort of . PAUL VERRALL ( Hammering . ) Well , think about it , Billie. p. 105 BILLIE DAWN ( Softly , watching him . ) You 're crazy about me , are n't you ? PAUL VERRALL ( Frankly . ) Yes . BILLIE DAWN That 's why you get so mad at Harry . PAUL VERRALL Listen , I hate his life , what he does , what he stands for . Not him . He just does n't know any better . ( Turns and crosses L. to front of couch . ) BILLIE DAWN ( Taking off glasses . ) I go for you , too . PAUL VERRALL ( Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILLIE DAWN That 's why I started doin ' all this . I guess you know . PAUL VERRALL No , I did n't . BILLIE DAWN lot of good it did me . I never had this kind of trouble before , I can tell you . PAUL VERRALL Trouble ? BILLIE DAWN After that first night when I met you I figured it was all going to work dandy . ( PAUL is looking at her . ) Then , when you would n't step across the line  --   --  I figured maybe the way to you was through your  --   --  head . p. 106 PAUL VERRALL ( Very slowly , crossing behind HER to R. of desk . ) Well  --   --  no . BILLIE DAWN Anyway what 's the diff now ? Difference ! But I like you anyways . Too late for the rest . PAUL VERRALL Why ? BILLIE DAWN Why ? Look , Paul , there 's a certain time between a fella and a girl when it either comes off or not and if it does n't then , then it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe we have n't got to our time yet ? BILLIE DAWN We did , too . And you dropped the ball . PAUL VERRALL Do n't be so sure . BILLIE DAWN I know . I 've had lots of fellas and I have n't had lots of fellas . If you know what I mean . PAUL VERRALL Yes . BILLIE DAWN ( Rising , crossing L.C. ) But I sure never thought I 'd go through a thing like this for anybody ! PAUL VERRALL Like what ? BILLIE DAWN Like gettin ' all mixed up in my head . Wondering and worrying and thinking  --  stuff like that . You know last night I went to bed and I started in thinking and I could n't get to sleep for ten minutes ! and I do n't know if it 's good to find out so much so quick ! ( Crosses L. to sofa and sits. ) p. 107 PAUL VERRALL ( Crossing L. to her . ) What the hell , Billie ! Nobody 's born smart . You know what 's the stupidest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got against babies all of a sudden ? PAUL VERRALL Nothing . I 've got nothing against a brain three weeks old and empty . But when it hangs around for thirty years without absorbing anything , I began to think something 's the matter with it . BILLIE DAWN ( Rising , deeply offended . ) What makes you think I 'm thirty ? PAUL VERRALL ( Retreating . ) I did n't mean you , especially . BILLIE DAWN ( Crossing L. and around back of sofa , angrily . ) Oh yes , you did . PAUL VERRALL I swear . BILLIE DAWN You certainly know how to get me sore . PAUL VERRALL ( Crossing up to U.R . corner of sofa . ) I 'm sorry . BILLIE DAWN ( Crossing to him , boiling . ) Thirty ! Do I look thirty to you ? PAUL VERRALL No. p. 108 BILLIE DAWN ( Face to face . ) Then what 'd you say it for ? PAUL VERRALL I do n't know . ( A short pause . ) How old are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PAUL smiles . SHE responds , reluctantly . HE bends down , kisses her cheek . ) PAUL VERRALL Do n't stop . ( SHE moves into an embrace . ) I meant , do n't stop studying . BILLIE DAWN Oh . ( Crosses L. back of sofa to D.L. ) PAUL VERRALL Will you ? BILLIE DAWN ( Crossing D.L. around front of sofa . ) I do n't know why it 's so important to you . PAUL VERRALL sort of a cause . I want everybody to be smart . As smart as they can be . A world full of ignorant people is too dangerous to live in . BILLIE DAWN ( Sitting . ) I know , that 's why I wish I was doin ' better . PAUL VERRALL You 're doing wonderfully . BILLIE DAWN Yeah , but it 's just no use . I bet most people would laugh at me if they knew what I was tryin ' to . p. 109 PAUL VERRALL I 'm not laughing . BILLIE DAWN I am . I 'm sort of laughin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I think I am anyway ? PAUL VERRALL What 's the matter ? BILLIE DAWN ( In tears . ) All them books ! PAUL VERRALL ( Crossing L. to sofa , sitting beside HER . ) It is n't only books , Billie . I 've told you a hundred times . BILLIE DAWN It 's mostly . PAUL VERRALL Not at all . Listen , who said this ? " The proper study of mankind is man . " BILLIE DAWN ( Gaining control . ) I do n't know . PAUL VERRALL You should . BILLIE DAWN Why ? PAUL VERRALL I 've told you . BILLIE DAWN I forgot . PAUL VERRALL Pope . BILLIE DAWN The Pope ? PAUL VERRALL No , not the Pope . Alexander Pope . BILLIE DAWN " The proper study of  --   --  " p. 110 PAUL VERRALL "  --   --  mankind is man . " BILLIE DAWN "  --  mankind is man . " Of course , that means womenkind , too ? PAUL VERRALL Yes . BILLIE DAWN ( Impatiently . ) Yes , I know . PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHE blows her nose . The tears end . ) BILLIE DAWN I been studying different mankind lately . The ones you told me ? Jane Addams last week , and this week Tom Paine . And then all by myself I got to thinkin ' about Harry . Like he works so hard to get what he wants . For instance . But he does n't know what he wants . PAUL VERRALL More of what he 's got , probably . BILLIE DAWN Money . PAUL VERRALL Money , more people to push around , money . BILLIE DAWN Well , he 's not so bad as you think he is . PAUL VERRALL I know . He 's got a brain of gold . ( Sound of key in door . BROCK comes in . ) HARRY BROCK Hello . PAUL VERRALL Hello , Harry . We were just talking about you . p. 111 HARRY BROCK ( Removing hat and coat and putting them on chair L. of door . ) Yeah ? Well , that ai n't what I pay ya for . ( Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large envelope . ) She knows enough about me . Too much , in fact . ( Crossing to chair L. of desk . ) Ed here ? BILLIE DAWN No . HARRY BROCK God damn it ! He 's supposed to meet me . ( PAUL and BILLIE watch as HE sits and takes off his shoes . ) PAUL VERRALL ( To BILLIE . ) What did you find out about Tom Paine ? BILLIE DAWN Well , he was quite a fella . PAUL VERRALL Where was he born , do you remember ? BILLIE DAWN London ? No . Or England . Some place like that . HARRY BROCK What d' you mean London or England ? It 's the same thing . BILLIE DAWN It is ? HARRY BROCK London is in England . It 's a city , London . England 's a whole country . BILLIE DAWN I forgot . HARRY BROCK ( To PAUL . ) Honest to God , boy ! You got some patience ! p. 112 PAUL VERRALL Take it easy . HARRY BROCK How can anybody get so dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry . BILLIE DAWN ( To BROCK . ) Who 's Tom Paine , for instance ? HARRY BROCK What ? BILLIE DAWN You heard me . Tom Paine ? HARRY BROCK What the hell do I care who he is ? BILLIE DAWN I know . HARRY BROCK So what ? If I wanted to know who he is so I 'd know who he is . I just do n't care . ( To PAUL . ) Go ahead . Do n't let me butt in . PAUL VERRALL ( To BILLIE . ) Which of his books did you like best ? BILLIE DAWN Well , I did n't read by him , yet  --  only about him . PAUL VERRALL Oh . BILLIE DAWN But I made a list of  --   --  ( She turns to get pad from end table . ) HARRY BROCK ( Interrupting suddenly . ) Who 's Rabbit Maranville ? p. 113 BILLIE DAWN ( Turning quickly . ) Who ? HARRY BROCK ( Over-enunciating . ) Rabbit Maranville . BILLIE DAWN I don ' know any rabbits ! HARRY BROCK think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortstop for the Braves , did n't he ? HARRY BROCK ( To PAUL . ) What 're you ? Some kind of a genius ? PAUL VERRALL No . HARRY BROCK ( Rising , crossing behind desk . ) I hire and fire geniuses every day . PAUL VERRALL I 'm sure you do . ( HE turns to BILLIE . ) Where 's that. ? BILLIE DAWN ( Handing over her list . ) Here . ( BROCK crosses D.R. to front of desk , thinking hard . ) PAUL VERRALL ( Studying list . ) Well , suppose you start with " The Age of Reason . " BILLIE DAWN ( Writing it down . ) " The-Age-of-Reason. " p. 114 PAUL VERRALL Then , next , you might  --   --  HARRY BROCK ( Front of desk . ) Who 's Willie Hop ? PAUL VERRALL ( Turning slightly . ) National billiard champion . And it 's pronounced  --   --  Hopp . HARRY BROCK That 's what I said . Anyways , I did n't ask you . I asked her . ( He crosses R. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns back to BILLIE . ) Where were we ? BILLIE DAWN ( With a look of disgust in BROCK 's direction . ) " Age of Reason . " PAUL VERRALL All right , then try " The Rights of Man . " BILLIE DAWN ( Writing . ) " The-Rights-of-Man . " ( BROCK slowly crosses to C. ) PAUL VERRALL I think that 'll give you a rough idea of what  --   --  HARRY BROCK ( Suddenly , crossing to them . ) What 's a peninsula ? BILLIE DAWN ( Waving him off . ) Sshhh ! ! p. 115 HARRY BROCK Do n't give me that Sshhh  --   --  ! You think you know so much  --   --  what 's a peninsula ? PAUL VERRALL It 's a  --   --  HARRY BROCK Not you . BILLIE DAWN ( Confidently and with condescending superiority . ) It 's that new medicine ! ! ! ( BROCK turns away , throwing up his hands in surrender , crosses to front of desk , D.R. then comes back to sofa . ) HARRY BROCK It is not ! BILLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arms stiffly at his sides . ) It 's a body of land surrounded on three sides by water . ( He relaxes . ) BILLIE DAWN So what 's that to know ? HARRY BROCK So what 's this  --   --  this Sam Paine to know ? BILLIE DAWN ( Straightening up . ) Some difference ! Tom Paine  --   --  not Sam Paine  --  Tom Paine practically started this whole country . HARRY BROCK You mean he 's dead ? p. 116 BILLIE DAWN Of course . HARRY BROCK ( Yelling at PAUL . ) What the hell you learnin ' her about dead people ? I just want her to know how to act with live people ! PAUL VERRALL Education 's pretty hard to control , Harry . One thing leads to another . It 's a matter of awakening curiosity  --  imagination  --  independence  --  first thing you know  --  HARRY BROCK ( Crossing R. to chair L. of desk . ) Work on her , not me .

ED DEVERY ( Smiling . ) Well , you listen to the speeches  --  you read the papers  --  you make up your own mind . You take a look and see who 's for who  --  that 's very important .

( DEVERY crosses R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126 SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES ( Lightly . ) That 's all there is to it . BILLIE DAWN ( To HEDGES . ) Yuh , but why do you take it from Harry ?

You do n't like to be doin ' all his dirty work  --  because you know you 're better than him . ED DEVERY ( White . ) That 's enough . BILLIE DAWN ( Plunging ahead , loudly . ) But I 'm not so sure  --  maybe you 're worse ! ( DEVERY looks at her for a moment , then goes upstairs and into BROCK 'S room , in angry determination . BILLIE looks up at BROCK 'S door , picks up papers and dictionary and brings them to sofa . Picks up papers and reads . A word baffles her . She looks it up . Then picks up papers again .

It was beautyful. p. 132 HARRY BROCK Where 'd you get all this ? BILLIE DAWN I looked it up . HARRY BROCK Why ? BILLIE DAWN No reason . I was just in the library . And look at him now . He hangs around and helps you promote , and lets you walk all over him just because you pay ' im for it . HARRY BROCK Oh , so we finally got around to me ! BILLIE DAWN Yuh .

( SHE runs up quickly , goes into her room . BROCK takes another drink . His attention goes to stack of books before him . Instantly he identifies it as the root of his problem . He pushes them to the floor , violently , finding a strange release in this . Kicks them out of his way and crosses to desk . Picks up one of the books on corner of desk and throws it to floor , U.C. Then another . Picks up another , tears it in half . There is mingled fury , excitement and satisfaction in his heart as he completes destruction of book . Starts on another , as DEVERY appears on balcony . BROCK stops , as though discovered in an indecent act , lets book drop to floor. ) p. 139 ED DEVERY ( On steps . ) All set ?

To put in the paper , I guess . HARRY BROCK ( Slams drawer , crosses to her . ) There 's some kinda jokes I do n't like . BILLIE DAWN ( Crossing to meet him C. ) It 's no joke . Paul says it 's the worst swindle since  --  uh  --  the teapot ! ( She shrugs uncertainly . ) Sump'n like that . ( Crosses to front of sofa . DEVERY and BROCK exchange a horrified look .

I 'll handle this . p. 163 ED DEVERY All right . ( Crosses back to liquor . ) HARRY BROCK You brought this guy around in the first place . Remember that . You 're about as much help to me as a boil on the  --  ( Stops as PAUL comes in , followed by EDDIE . EDDIE guards door . BROCK moves to PAUL , who senses the trap . ) I think you got sump'n by mistake belongs to me . PAUL VERRALL That so ? HARRY BROCK How about it ? ( PAUL looks at BILLIE . BROCK signals EDDIE , who grabs PAUL 'S arms . BROCK frisks him . ) PAUL VERRALL Hey ! HARRY BROCK ( Pointing to sofa . ) Siddown . ( PAUL sits beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

( PAUL looks at him , smiles , shakes his head . ) All right , if you wan na play it rough , I know how to do that , too . ( Signals EDDIE , who locks front door . BROCK walks to service wing , bolts door . His determination and purpose strike a kind of terror in every person in the room . Moves back to sofa . ) Now you listen , you two heels . I mean business . I got too much at stake down here . You got sump'n belongs to me . And if you wan na get outa here alive  --  you 're gon na give it back . I 'm no blowhard . ( To BILLIE . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) He 's no blowhard . ( Then , seriously . ) He 's had people killed before . Like once , about six years ago there was a strike at one of his  --  HARRY BROCK Shut up ! You ai n't gon na be telling nobody nothin ' pretty soon . BILLIE DAWN ( Rising to her knees , pointing at BROCK , derisively . ) Double negative ! ( To PAUL . ) Right ? PAUL VERRALL Right ! ( A pause . EDDIE is fixing a drink. ) p. 165 HARRY BROCK You do n't seem to be gettin ' the idea . You never been in trouble like you 're gon na be if you do n't do what I 'm tellin ' ya ! ( Starts for PAUL . ) ED DEVERY ( Intercepting him . ) Wait a minute , Harry . There 's another way to handle this . ( BROCK turns away , crosses R. as DEVERY speaks to PAUL . ) I really think you 've pulled a boner , friend . My advice to you is lay off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noses into my business . BILLIE DAWN Yeah . HARRY BROCK Look who 's talkin ' about stickin ' noses . You 're the goddamndest butinski I ever run into ! ( EDDIE comes down and hands BROCK drink . ) PAUL VERRALL told you once before , Harry , that 's my job . HARRY BROCK What ? Gettin ' in my way ? ( EDDIE crosses back to door , leans against it . ) PAUL VERRALL Not exactly . HARRY BROCK What then ? I 'd like to know . No kiddin ' . PAUL VERRALL To find out what goes on and get it to the people . p. 166 HARRY BROCK What people ? PAUL VERRALL The people . HARRY BROCK Never heard of ' em . BILLIE DAWN You will , Harry , some day . They 're gettin ' to be more and more well-known all the time . ED DEVERY ( To PAUL . ) What if I told you this whole operation is strictly according to law ? PAUL VERRALL Then I 'd say the law needs revision . HARRY BROCK Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARRY BROCK Since when ? BILLIE DAWN Since  --  uh  --  1779 ! ( To PAUL . ) Right ? PAUL VERRALL Right ! HARRY BROCK What ? ( DEVERY is back at liquor supply . ) PAUL VERRALL ( Rising , moving to BROCK . ) Of course , I 'm the government . What do you think the government is , Harry ? A man , a monster , a machine ? It 's you and me and a few million more . We 've got to learn to look after each other . HARRY BROCK Thanks , I can look after myself . p. 167 BILLIE DAWN ( To PAUL . ) He does n't get it . I think it 's because you still talk too fancy . ( To BROCK . ) Look , Harry , the idea is you can only get away with your kind of shenanigans if nobody cares about it . HARRY BROCK I know what I 'm doin ' . I got my rights same as anybody else . BILLIE DAWN More ! You keep buyin ' more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROCK You got nothin ' to say to me . ( EDDIE opens door , HEDGES comes in , EDDIE closes door .

SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES ( C. ) What ? HARRY BROCK ( Close to him . ) Do n't be so happy ! SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES What 's the trouble ? ED DEVERY Well , our friend Verrall here has  --  uh  --  stumbled on a little something . I do n't know what he thinks it means . p. 168 PAUL VERRALL I 'll tell you . Just that there may be some connection between Harry 's combine and the Senator 's amendment . SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES ( To PAUL . ) Now , just a moment , son . I 've got nothing against you young radicals  --  used to be one myself  --  but you simply wo n't be practical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Done every day . I do n't know why you single us out to make a fuss about . HARRY BROCK Yeah , why ? PAUL VERRALL ( To HEDGES . ) Done every day , sir , right . For all I know an undiscovered murder is committed every day . What does that prove ? All this undercover pressure  --  bribery  --  corruption  --  government between friends . Sure it goes on all the time , and it 's tough to crack . Ask me . I 've tried for years . You need more than the knowing about it . You 've got to have the facts and the figures and most important  --  the names . BILLIE DAWN ( Chirping . ) And he 's got ' em . SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES ( Angry . ) You be careful , young man , when you use the word bribery in my presence . BILLIE DAWN Eighty thousand dollars you got . What word do you want ' im to use ? Tip ? ( HEDGES pales and looks helplessly at BROCK. ) p. 169 SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell do I care what you feel ? I feel , too . SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES I ca n't take any smearing now . It 's a bad time . HARRY BROCK ( Pushing HEDGES aside . ) Knock off ! ( HEDGES crosses to desk , as BROCK moves to PAUL . ) All right , now we all had our little beat around the bush . Let 's get down to it . What can we work out ? PAUL VERRALL You just heard your lawyer say it was all according to law . HARRY BROCK Yeah . PAUL VERRALL If that 's the case , what 's bothering you ? HARRY BROCK I do n't like a lotta noise , that 's all . PAUL VERRALL I 'll be very quiet . HARRY BROCK What 'll you take , Paul ? PAUL VERRALL ( Crossing to liquor and pouring drink . ) I 'll take a drink , please , if I may . HARRY BROCK Do n't be fancy with me . I never yet met a guy did n't have his price . PAUL VERRALL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm talkin ' about big numbers . BILLIE DAWN ( Louder . ) You and your big numbers ! If you do n't watch out , you 'll be wearin ' one across your chest ! ( PAUL finishes drink . HEDGES sits , back of desk , at sea . ) HARRY BROCK ( To BILLIE . ) I 'll get to you later . ( To PAUL . ) Make up your mind . There 's two ways we can do business . One  --  you play ball  --  make it worth your while . Two  --  you better start watchin ' your step . There 'll be no place you can walk  --  no place you can live , if you monkey-wrench me ! ( A pause . ) What d' you say ? PAUL VERRALL I 'd like to think it over ! HARRY BROCK All right . You got two minutes ! ( Crosses R. to front of desk . PAUL looks at BILLIE , at BROCK , then sits quietly . Looks at BILLIE again , then at DEVERY . BILLIE , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking an avenue of escape . PAUL looks at EDDIE , standing near steps of balcony . EDDIE and BROCK exchange a look . PAUL looks at BROCK , then at BILIE again . HE ponders a moment , looks at his watch. ) p. 171 PAUL VERRALL Come on , Billie . ( PAUL moves to door . BILIE rises slowly to follow . BROCK starts after PAUL . Simultaneously , DEVERY starts U.L. around couch . ) ED DEVERY Wait a minute , Harry ! ( HE is crossing to BROCK . ) SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES ( Rising . ) Now , let 's not lose our tempers . BILLIE DAWN ( Rushing to phone . ) Harry ! Harry ! ( BROCK reaches PAUL and in a sudden inhuman burst , swings him around , grabs him by throat and begins to strangle him . PAUL goes to his knees , BROCK hangs on . ) ED DEVERY ( In a panic . ) Cut it out ! Harry ! SENATOR NORVAL HEDGES Oh , my God ! BILLIE DAWN ( Picks up phone and screams . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEY struggle for phone noisily . DEVERY and HEDGES are desperately attempting to prevent murder . Finally , they tear BROCK loose . BILLIE rushes to PAUL to help him . His glasses have been knocked off and his clothes are torn . He is groggy . DEVERY throws BROCK onto sofa , where he sits , spent and subdued. ) p. 172 ED DEVERY ( To BROCK . ) You goddamn fool ! Where the hell do you think you are ? Ca n't you see all this muscle stuff is a thing of the past ? You cut it out , or you 'll be a thing of the past , too . ( Crosses to liquor . ) HARRY BROCK I got mad ! PAUL VERRALL ( Coming down to him . ) Who are you to get mad , you big baboon ? You ought to be grateful you 're allowed to walk around free . HARRY BROCK ( Warning . ) You do n't know me good enough for that kinda talk . PAUL VERRALL ( Losing his temper . ) I know you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell do you guys want , anyway ? You 've got all the oil and all the lumber and steel and coal  --  what do you want now  --  all the people ? All the laws ? HARRY BROCK ( Rising . ) Do n't blow your top ! ( Crosses to PAUL . ) I 'm still ready to do business . How 's a hundred grand ? PAUL VERRALL ( Turning away , crossing to L. of desk . ) A hundred grand is beautiful  --  but I ca n't do it . p. 173 HARRY BROCK Why not ? ( A pause . ) PAUL VERRALL ( Turning to him . ) My wife would n't like it . ( Another pause . ) BILLIE DAWN ( Softly . ) She certainly would n't ! HARRY BROCK ( To PAUL . ) All right , then , what 's your idea ? PAUL VERRALL Nothing  --  no idea  --  I 'm just trying to show you that  --  look , there 's a difference between junk and  --  legislation 's not meant for buying and selling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who inhibit it ! " PAUL VERRALL ( Correcting her. ) "  --  inhabit ! " BILLIE DAWN "  --  inhabit it ! " HARRY BROCK What the hell you two battin ' about ? I don ' see what I 'm doin ' so wrong . This is America , ai n't it ? Where 's all this free enterprise they 're always talkin ' about ? ED DEVERY ( Toasting . ) To free enterprise ! ( Drinks. ) p. 174 HARRY BROCK ( To PAUL . ) You 're just sore because I made good and you ai n't . Everybody had the same chance as me  --  all them kids I usta know  --  so where are they now ? BILLIE DAWN ( Coming to him . ) No place . Because you beat ' em out , like you said . You always wan na hold everybody down so you can get it all for yourself . That 's why there 's like my father  --  and like me . I wanted  --  and he could n't give me  --  so I wind up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always did what I want and I 'm always gon na .

ED DEVERY They 're right . ( EDDIE is getting BROCK another drink . ) HARRY BROCK Who the hell 's side you on ? EDDIE BROCK ( Handing BROCK drink . ) Rye ginger ale . HARRY BROCK Who asked you ? Butt out ! ( Hands glass back to EDDIE , who retreats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe another time , Harry , not now . And if you 're going to try again  --  do it fast . It gets harder all the time  --  people get wiser  --  they hear more  --  they read more  --  they talk more . When enough of them know enough  --  that 'll be the end of you . HARRY BROCK Do n't worry about me . PAUL VERRALL I do , though . I worry like hell . I stay up nights . When you live in Washington , it 's enough to break your heart . You see a perfect piece of machinery  --  the democratic structure  --  and somebody 's always tampering with it and trying to make it hit the jackpot . ED DEVERY ( Toasting . ) To the jackpot . ( Drinks. ) p. 176 HARRY BROCK I 'm no gambler . I 'm a business man . PAUL VERRALL You certainly are , but you tried the wrong business .
