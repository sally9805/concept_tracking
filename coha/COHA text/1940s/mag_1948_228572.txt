A century ago conservative Britons comforted themselves that their House of Lords was an anchor against the tempest of public opinion . A lord became a lord by appointment of the King , or by the happy chance of having a titled father . He owed nothing to any voter , and could afford ( if he chose ) to base his approach to any public matter on the dictum : " The public be damned . " <P> But the damned public was not so easily ignored ; through the years it had whittled the Lords ' powers until the House had become little more than a debating society filled with crotchety , beef-pink , ultraconservative old men . Nobody but the Lords themselves paid much attention to the House of Lords-and that could sometimes lead to error , as Britain 's Labor government found out last week . In fact , the error blew into a tempest in which the government , to its acute embarrassment , got a severe tossing . <P> Conscience v. Party Line . The immediate issue was capital punishment for murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Clement Attlee 's government , there was a larger stake . It was the dramatic recurrence of the old feud between the hereditary Lords and the elected Commons . <P> Clement Attlee 's cabinet had been against abolishing capital punishment , but when the subject came up in the House of Commons ( TIME , April 22 ) , the government adopted a hands-off policy and permitted Labor members to vote according to conscience , and not according to party line . <P> They voted for abolition . Under British procedure the bill could not become law until approved by the House of Lords , or if they chose not to approve , Commons could , at the end of two years , reaffirm its vote and make it law anyway . But , with four murderers under death sentence , impulsive , humanitarian Home Secretary Chuter Ede did not even wait for the bill to reach debate in the House of Lords . He reprieved them . <P> " That Makes It Worse . " What , thundered the noble lords last week , was the government thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? The government 's Herbert Morrison came over to the House of Lords for the debate . He sat on a step with his elbow on the throne seat , passing a fretful hand through his thinning hair . Lord Chief Justice Goddard declared Mr. Ede 's action unconstitutional . Viscount Cecil of Chelwood leveled a stern , accusing finger at Lord Jowitt who , as Lord Chancellor , was Prime Minister Attlee 's nominee in the House of Lords , and thundered : <P> " This comes near to complete dictatorship by the cabinet . " Responded Jowitt : " Oh , no . The cabinet had nothing to do with it . It was the Home Secretary entirely . " The Lords audibly drew a sharp breath , spent it in cheers when Viscount Cecil said : " That makes it worse . " <P> In the end , the Lords rejected the abolition bill , 181 to 28 , sent it back to Commons for reconsideration . For once , the Lords and public opinion were in line . A public-opinion poll showed a large majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll only complicated the Labor government 's dilemma . To uphold the House of Commons , it might have to adopt a bill it had not really wanted . On the other hand , if it followed public opinion , it would be upholding the almost , but not quite , forgotten Lords .
