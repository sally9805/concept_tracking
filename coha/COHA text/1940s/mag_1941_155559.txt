Jamie Brooke was a rich young Briton who bought a ship , stocked it with arms , and sailed for the East Indies as a privateer . One hundred years ago he set himself up as the white Raja of Sarawak , a wild , head-hunting State in northwest Borneo . A British court found evidence that Jamie Brooke had got his principality by violence and trickery , and that he thereafter practiced ruthless extortion on the natives . But he was acquitted , was knighted by Queen Victoria . <P> Sarawak 's present Raja is 66-year-old Sir Charles Vyner Brooke , grandnephew of Sir James . A suave , hard , efficient potentate , he has ruled his 500,000 brown-skinned subjects with an iron hand for 24 years . But last week word reached Britain that on the centenary of Brooke rule in Sarawak last month Sir Charles had set up a constitutional monarchy . <P> Why Sir Charles chose to abandon some of his autocratic power might have remained a mystery if Sir Charles 's family troubles were not so well known . It takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , like many a European dynasty , the Brookes have waxed no stronger as their line grew old . Sir Charles sired three daughters , no son to follow him as Sarawak 's Tuan Muda ( Crown Prince ) . <P> One daughter , Leonora Margaret Brooke ( known to the press as Princess Gold ) , made a noble alliance when she married the late Earl of Inchcape , a P. &; O. shipping tycoon . But Elizabeth Brooke ( Princess Pearl ) married a jazz-band leader , Harry Roy . Nancy Valerie Brooke ( Princess Baba ) married and divorced a professional wrestler , Bob Gregory . To make matters worse , Sir Charles 's wife , the Ranee , a daughter of the late Viscount Esher , published her autobiography , Relations and Complications , indiscreetly revealing the details of Sir Charles 's courtship , their marital relations . The Ranee , now in Manhattan , cut off from her British income , works for a living at the Chateau Martin Winery ( see cut , p. 57 ) , says she will rejoin the Raja " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Raja 's prestige in Sarawak . Two years ago Sir Charles , looking about for a suitable heir to the throne , decided his brother , Bertram Willes Dayrell Brooke ( now 64 ) , was too old . Besides , Bertram 's wife had also got her name in the papers by embracing Mohammedanism after being successively a Protestant , Christian Scientist , Roman Catholic . So Sir Charles appointed Bertram 's son , Antoni Walter Dayrell Brooke , to be Sarawak 's Tuan Muda . Then he sailed for England . <P> Antoni Brooke promptly went to Rangoon , married a pretty young commoner , Kathleen Hudden . Back in Sarawak , Sir Charles showed his displeasure by removing Antoni as Tuan Muda . Said he tersely : " It appears to us that our nephew is not yet fitted for the exercise of the responsibilities of this high office .
