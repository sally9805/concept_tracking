txt Coincident with the validation of the red " B " stamps in War Ration Book 2 ? making possible for many small New England families their first rationed purchases of large roasts , hams , and other choice items  --  the Office of Price Administration today declared specific cents-per-pound ceiling prices on retail sales of beef , veal , lamb , and mutton . At the same time , the OPA ruled that any reductions in point values of meats and rationed foods must be accompanied by lower retail prices . Heretofore , butchers have been permitted to lower point values without reducing prices " if there was danger of spoilage . " Now , they must also cut prices by at least 25 per cent below established ceilings . Effective on April 15 , the new ceiling prices on beef , veal , lamb , and mutton will extend throughout the United States , which has been divided ? as was the case when pork price ceilings were established  --  into 12 zones . Roast of Beef 40 Cents In the New England zone , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a pound , or less , and hamburger for 32 or 33 ? rents , depending upon the category I of the market . With these new ceilings posted at each meat counter or store , every New England housewife will know the top prices which she may be charged when she surrenders to her butcher the necessary red stamps from her ration book . Striking a telling blow at " black markets " in meats , the new price action  --  coupled with meat ration-I make it impossible for Hblack market " operators to continue to pose as legitimate retailers . Furthermore , the new amendment to the rationing regulations will , the OPA believes , " put a brake on retailers who during the early stages of the new meats and fats rationing program have tended to abuse the point-lowering device provided in the regulations . " Must Be Reduced From now on , the OPA pointed out , if a retailer lowers the point value more than 25 per cent , the selling price must be reduced in proportion , except that in no case , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent . Retailers " acting in good faith , " I will not suffer from the regulation said the OPA , since it is normal I practice to reduce prices when items must be moved quickly to prevent spoilage . In this connection , State OPA enforcement officers started out early today to make a survey of retail dealers throughout Massachusetts , to determine just how the meats and fats rationing program is working . This will in no sense be an " enforcement " drive , however , said State OPA Administrator Lawrence J. Bresnahan . Rather , it will be a survey designed to correct abuses and to co-operate both with the trade and consumers to " make a go " of the new program . Getting Larger Piece With red " B " stamps becoming valid yesterday , many a housewife ? who last week had used most of her red " A " stamps for butter and small purchases of meats  --  looked forward this week to combining the few leftover " A 's " with her red " B 's " and buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps will become valid at midnight next Sunday . Wiping out by the store-by-store meat price maximums , which formerly permitted any establishment to charge its highest price of March , 1942 , the newest price-ceiling action of the OPA set down in dollar and cents the highest prices for each of 102 cuts of beef , veal , lamb , and mutton , which will become effective the middle of this month . In some cases , where stores had abnormally low individual ceilings , the new prices will permit of slight increases . However , in many cases , prices will be forced down , the OPA said . Linked to Grades A feature of the new order is that prices are linked to various grades of meats . The Department grades of beef , for instance are " AA , or choice , " " A , or good , " " B , or commercial , " and " C , utility . " For the protection of consumers , OPA will require that retailers do not remove any of these markings ( put on ? carcasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although retailers need not do any grading or posting of grades on their own initiative . The 102 cuts for which prices have been established represent a consensus of existing practices , standardized in meetings throughout the country . As in the case of the rationing rules , hamburger is defined as a ground-up preparation of scraps and discarded cuts . And any housewife who wants ground round steak , for instance , must buy the steak at its regular price and point value , and have it ground afterward . Similarly , cube steaks will not be permitted to be prepared in advance by butchers , and customers will have to buy the original cut and have it cubed . In both cases , butchers are forbidden to charge extra for the grinding or cubing . Show Selling Prices I In their regular displays , lbutchers i are required to show only their selling prices of cuts and the ration point costs . However , each store must post a list of its legally maximum prices . These lists will ' be printed by the Government . , By way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veal , lamb , and mutton , effective !
