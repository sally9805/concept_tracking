" She 's been going too hard . It 's a pity that brides will wear themselves out . " He sat down close to her sofa and looked at her inquiringly . " I suppose so . I have n't had much experience . " Yielding to a sudden impulse , Lavinia leaned over and put her large , soft hand on his arm . " Do you think she is happy , Craig ? " " Happy ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " That 's a good deal to ask , is n't it ? " " Well , you are , are n't you ? " For an instant , he simply stared at her . " Good God ! " he exclaimed presently . " Do I look it ? " She shook her head . " You do not . But it is n't easy to tell anything by the way you look . Your face is n't confiding . " " I ca n't help that . It 's the way I was made .

I have wondered whether it would n't be betterto postpone your marriage till till . . . " " Till what ? " " Till you 're sure you are n't risking great unhappiness . " He was silent for so long that she decided he had refused to answer her question . Then , just as she was on the point of speaking again , he moved his arm and let her hand slip away . " Would n't the breaking off  --  for I suppose you really mean breaking off  --  mean great unhappiness ? " he asked in a voice that vibrated with pain  --  or was it resentment ? " But would n't it be worse to go on unless  --  unless you are both sure of yourselves ? " He laughed angrily . " Well , I 'm sure , for one . " " And is Stanley ?

" He swallowed hard , as if he were forcing down a lump in his throat . " I have n't asked her . I 'm afraid to ask her . " " She is still too young . " " She was happy at first . I know she was happy at first . " " Yes , I thought so . All of us opposed this marriage , her uncle and I were firm against it . We felt that she had n't really found herself , and that when she grew up , she would regret it . But she would n't listen to us . She was bent on having what she wanted . " She sighed hopelessly .

Not , " she corrected herself hastily , " that Stanley has many ideas . " He assented moodily , while Lavinia thought , No , men have n't changed , nor , for that matter , has emotion or appetite . " But she never seemed to care what I believed in , " Craig was saying moodily . " She was sweet about everything . She did n't mind my being what you call radical . She was satisfiedjust to be worshipped . " " I know , " Mrs. Timberlake said sympathetically . " She likes being loved , and she has n't really any serious inter-ests . " " That did n't matter . I wanted her just as she was . And it 's only five days ahead , " he burst out passionately . " In five days we are to be married ! " " You love her like that ?

" From the first glance , " he answered desperately . " I 've never had another thought since I first looked at her . It was just as if  --  as if all my bones went suddenly soft . " Too soft . Yes , that was the trouble , she told herself wearily . You can be too soft with women , and with men , too , for that matter . Human relationship , to endure , must be woven of tough fiber underneath the gentler emotions . Deep down below her conscious mind , she knew that her own marriage would have been happier if Asa , in his over-sensitivenature , had a touch of the barbarian at play . " Poor boy , " she murmured aloud . " It is hard on you . " Then , after a wondering pause , " But your convictions  --  your social theories , I thought they meant so much to you ? " " They did once . I used to think I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really believed I was interested in aggregates , not in individuals , till . . . till a thunderboltstruck me . After I met Stanley , all I could think about was wanting her . " " Poor boy , " Lavinia repeated soothingly ; for it was the kind of pause , she felt , which demanded either a prayer or a recurring phrase . Yes , he was weak , she conceded . Any man was weak who sacrificed his convictions or his purpose in life for a woman , especially for the painted shell of a girl . Though she adored Stanley , she had , even as a mother , no illusions about her daughter.  | " What must I do ? " he asked abruptly . " I want her to be happy . I 'll do whatever she  --  whatever you . . . " He bit off his words and looked at her with a despairing hesitation . " Tell her that . Go and ask her what you must do . " " She would n't answer . She would n't even listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates to be pinned down . " " Yes , I know . That 's the way she is . She ca n't help it . " " I 'd give my life for her . I 'd give up all that I believed . " " But that 's the wrong way . Ca n't you see it 's the wrong way ? The only way to keep love is by holding on firmly to something else . " Lavinia knew , she told herself with conviction , because she had tried his way in youth and so had lost everything . She had tried to run away from reality , and she had found that the only road away from life brought you back again in a circle . " You will have to work it out between you , " she said . " I ca n't help you . Nobody can help you but yourselves . And do n't forget that in five days it will be too late to wish you 'd done differently . " He stood up and straightened his shoulders . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any use . After all , I may be mistaken  --  we may both be mistaken . . . " His voice was stronger and a light shone in his face . " She may not have changed . She may still care as much as she ever did . " Lavinia 's eyes followed him as he left the room . He turned to smile at her before shutting the door . What a boy he was still , and how entirely unfitted for marriage ! He does n't know women , she said to herself . He does n't know the first thing about women . If only he had sense enough to stand by his convictions and to leave love alone  --  at least , until he had spent his passion on philanthropy , or revolution , or whatever it was that had once possessed his soul undividedly.  | YES , Father is right , Roy said to herself , Peter and I would be happier by ourselves . Picking up a comb from the bureau , she ran it through her hair , while she glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories on the walls . But what in the world would poor Father do with only Mother and Virgie ? she thought , after a minute . She hated the two cramped third storey rooms , which were hot in summer and insufficiently heated in autumn and winter . She could never have stood living up here , she decided , except for the sense of separateness from the rest of the house ,  --  and the plentifulwindows which looked out , in front , on the young maplesand , at the back , on the crooked boughs of the old tulip poplar . Why was it , she wondered , that she and her father had always stood so closely together , within the family circle , and yet a little apart from the rest of the family ? Her earliestrecollection , very dim and remote , was of his sitting by her bedside , day and night , when she had scarlet fever . He had stayed away from the factory , and shut himself in with her , when quarantine was imposed ; and she had refused to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hands . Until she met Peter , her father had been nearer to her than any one else , and she had thought resentfully of his endless drudgery and the monotonous round of his drab-colored life . But , more recently , ever since she had suffered from this gnawing fear of a disaster she never defined , she had thought of nothing but the constant ache at her own heart . People may say what they please , she thought bitterly , but unhappiness makes the soul shrink and dwindle.  |p105Crossing  the room , she stopped by the open window and looked down on the pavement , where the few passers-by appeared to be swimming slowly upstream , through fluid shadows . In the middle of the street , sparrows flocked in a brown cluster , which broke and scattered before the approachingwheels of a car . The noise of horns and brakes floated up and mingled with the cries of children , piercing yet as thin as the sound of distant bells chiming unmeaningly . Out of the mist of light in the west , pigeons swooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythms . Less than an hour before , she had felt the heightened consciousnesswhich is almost , if not quite , ecstasy . The world , the street , the sky , and her own heart had been suffused with joy . Why had it come like that ? she asked herself ; and why had it gone ? Breaking into her thoughts , she heard Peter 's step on the stairs ; and while she listened , the rapid beating of her heart seemed to stifle her . After two years of marriage , his returnat the end of the day could still start again in her nerves that urgent whisper of excitement which quivered and then died . She heard his hand on the door-knob . In another second , the door had opened and shut , and he came quickly into the room , to stop short , as if in astonishment . " I did n't know you 'd come in , " he said , with a breathless laugh . " I have no sense of time , and that 's all wrong for a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms about her and brushed her cheek with his lips . His kiss felt like a leaf , like a dead leaf , she thought , watching him with eyes that were bright and wistful . His kiss was as stiff and dry as the brushing of a dead leaf . Yet , while the thought was still in her mind , she was aware again of his power over her , of that responsive vibration . Do I love him too much ? she asked herself . Is love always pain when it is more than the heart can hold ? Or was it only that she knew , without admitting the knowledge , that he was slipping beyond her ? Was her distraught longing merely the agonized involuntary clutch of emotion at an endangeredpart of her life , the most precious and necessary part , which was broken away ? Drawing a little aside , she searched for some reassurance in the face that was more familiar to her than were her own features . She saw the thick fair hair , red in the shadow , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wind ; the dark heavy brows beetling in a frown over near-sighted brown eyes ; the large , strong nose , with wide nostrils ; and the vigorous sweep of the jaw , as well as the generous but irresolute curve of the mouth , which seemed , nowadays , to have coarsened a trifle , above the square and firmly modelled chin , with its surprising cleft in the center . She saw these things , but what she felt , without seeing distinctly , was the vital force that enkindled his look . His animal well-being diffused the glow , and the warmth , and the physical combativenessof pure energy . Or was it simply that she imaginedthis because she was in love with him still ? Was it because  --  oh , well , but there was no use in wondering ! " I came as soon as I could , " she answered slowly . " I hoped . .. " " Then it is later than I thought . I must hurry away again . " " I hoped we might go out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " She bent her head , hiding her eyes.  | " I wish I could . But I 've got to go out of town . Bellamy called me just as I was leaving the hospital . I 'm in the devil of a hurry . " He went into the bathroom , and a minute later she heard water gushing and the clatter of the soap dish against the porcelain . When he came out , he was running a comb through his hair . " I ca n't find my collars . I do n't seem to have any clean collars , " he said irritably . " You did n't look . They 're in the second drawer . Are you obliged to go before dinner ? " " I ca n't wait . It 's an emergency case , out of town . Bellamyis going with me . " " Where is it ? Are you sure that you 'll have to spend the night ? " " No , I 'm not sure . I 'm not sure of anything . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " He seemed in desperatehaste , and for a minute she watched him hurriedly stuffing clothes into a small suitcase . His shoulders , she noticed , twitched as he turned his back on her , but his strong , steady hands were not trembling . " Let me pack it for you , " she said at last . " You are n't taking the right things . " " Oh , that 's all right . " He pushed her aside while he fastenedthe suitcase . " It does n't matter , really . That 's all right , I say , " he added , in a prickly tone , when she would have helped him . I do n't know him , she thought , suddenly chilled . I do n't know him , and he does n't know himself any better than I do . He never used to be like this . He never used to be prickly to the touch .

" I like you in blue , " she said as casually as she could . He glanced down . " Yes , it 's blue , is n't it ? " " Did n't you know ? Did you put it on without looking ? " " I was n't thinking about it . " " But your tie matches . You always like things to match . " " Things to match , " he hummed , in a jazz tune , beneath his breath . " Yes , I like things to match . " He smiled at her in the old way which he had forgotten or lost , and she felt that a veil had suddenly dropped between her and life . Withoutand within there was this faint humming , which approachedand receded , in the room , in the sky , and in her own senses . A thought throbbed , with a pang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stops loving me . I could n't . . I could n't . " Oh , Peter , I 'm tired of living with other people . Let 's go to ourselves . I 'd rather be poor by ourselves . " His smile faded , and he looked anxious and older . " Why , I thought we were all right , " he said gently . " I thought you liked being here . " " But you hate it . You did n't want it in the beginning . " He nodded gravely , trying , she could see , not to hurt her . " That was in the beginning . I 've got used to it , now . " " We ought to have gone . We ought to have gone to ourselvesat the start . " His eyes were moody as he stared at her . " Well , it was n't my fault . I wanted a home of our own .

" Her voice quivered and broke . " I mean , I 'm used to it . " He turned away to the mirror . " I wanted to begin differently , but I 've settled down . I 'm used to things as they are . " " But I 'm not . I want to be alone with you . I 'm never really alone with you . There 's always somebody else . And I hate this new house . I just pretended I did n't .

" " Yes , I know . " An ache , like a cold shudder , had seized her throat . What did it mean ? What did anything mean ? " We 're free . Of course , we 're free as  --  as air . " He slipped into his coat and then , after he had gone to the door , turned back quickly and kissed her on the cheek . " You 're a good sport , Roy , " he said , almost humbly . " I like a good sport . " For an instant she clung to him before her hands dropped away from his arm . " What does freedom matter as long as we love each other ? " she asked with a catch in her voice . " It does n't matter a bit , really , only we used to talk about it for hours . " " That was before . . . before . . . " " Well , but we meant it , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jesting , but she could n't be sure . " We meant every word of it . "  | " Yes , we meant it . " She drew herself up with a gallant gesture . " And we still mean it . " Though his tone was gay , his eyes brooded unhappily . " Why , but of course we mean it . I remember there were to be no strings to our marriage . Even when I was little , - I hated anything with a string to it . " Her smile remained bright and firm . " That was your idea always . " " And yours too . We both felt that way . We both still feel that way , " she corrected herself , on a note of mocking defiance . For it does n't do any good to whimper , she thought , not any least good in the world . " Well , thank God , my dear , " he said , " I did n't marry a womanly woman . " Her smile had not broken . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had tried to bite back on her lips , broke out in a sharp despairing cry : " Oh , Peter , what has happened ? Why are you so unhappy ? " Standing there , in the narrow space of the half-open door , he looked back at her without speaking ; and she felt that this silence was surrounding them in waves and cutting them off , alone on an island in time , as if the present moment were separated forever from both the past and the future . It was her life , she knew , and yet it seemed to have no part in life as a whole . But was it only the silence ? Was there something else , some fear , some antagonism , some repulsion , surging there in a deep tidal movement between them ? " What an idea ! " he said presently . " What have I got to be unhappy about ? And you 're the best thing that could happen to anybody . If I 'm a coward , Roy , I 've only myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closed again , as if he were hesitating outside in the hall . An instant later , she heard his rapid footsteps turn away and begin to descend the stairs , while she went over to the front window and stood watching for his car in the street . The sudden hush in her mind seemed to her like the breathless pause in a storm between the lightning and the crash of the thunderbolt . It 's nothing , really , she said to herself , leaning over the window-sill . The little leaves on the maple stirred faintly ; the branches swayed in the wind ; and down below in the street a film of shadow flowed onward in ripples . Most of the pigeons had gone home to roost ; but a single lonely bird floated down from the trees and then swept up again into the paling sky . Of course , it 's nothing . It 's nothing but . . . but . . . oh , I love him too much ! Anything too much is always a pain . A sob shuddered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't people ever say what they mean ? Why is n't there any meaning in marriage ? Was this true only of marriage , or was it life itself that was meaningless ?

She had believed that the weak alone are defeated , that any dependence on something outside oneself is an infirmity of the past . Well , she could still believe that . She would n't go back to the old ways again . Not for anything in the world would she exchange her lot for her mother 's . Yet it was true that when fear came , Roy felt bereft , with nothing to cling to , while her mother could find support either in God or in surrender to circumstances . Anyhow , I am real , and she is n't , Roy thought bitterly . There is nothing real about Mother except her pretending . She turned away from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted her soft girlish chin in direct challenge to life . I , she was thinking , I am real , no matter what happens.  | WILLIAM FITZROY was old , but he was not yet too old to feel young in April . He had then his hours , surrounded by pretty girls , when he felt that he was scarcely more than a boy . And he had , too , those other hours , alone in the night , when he understood that the greatesttragedy of all is to linger on , among futile years , after one has finished with life . He had finished ; but he was still empty . Dreaming or awake , he knew that he had never had what he wanted ; and he knew , also , that in an old man 's dreams is a hungering not ever to be satisfied . Sitting on the terrace in the late sunshine , he had complainedof the chill breeze from the river , and Charlotte had fussily brought him into the library and touched a match to the small wood fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inadequacy of things in general and of marriage in particular , he glanced at his wife , as she sat on the other side of the hearth , knitting a baby 's blanket of pink wool . Married for more than fifty years ! and she might as well have been a casual woman who had nudged down into the seat beside him , while they rattled , over a rough road , in an omnibus . He had understood Charlotte , of course . Women , especially wives , he reflected , are easy to see through , since they lack that vast inner area of waking and sleeping dreams ; but he told her as little of the truth about his hidden self as he would have confided to the first attentive stranger he happened to meet . He still liked his wife ; he admired her disposition ; and no one , not even a husband , could fail to respect her ; but there was growing upon him , since he had entered that secondp114youth , which a benevolent Providence has denied to women , a suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And though it was true that the outward man , if not the inward Adam , had been designed for imaginary infidelitiesalone , he still cherished the delusion that a moral nature had inclined him to financial instead of feminine conquests . Because of failing health , and because in part , no doubt , of a sympathetic blonde in New York , his pursuit of pretty girls , in Queenborough at least , had now relaxed into the mere harmless vanity of the aging and impotent . Like all other successful men of his time and place in the South , he had seen , as a child , the ruin of his family fortunes and the complete reversal of a social system . His struggle had been hard and long , and in the severe process his nature also had hardened . One thought alone troubled him , if we except the itching disturbances of his dreams , and this was the painful knowledge that , no matter how tightly he clung to his possessions , the time must inevitably come when death would loosen his clutch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His fine new house , as bad as money was able to make it , would pass on to strangers , or , worse still , to relatives who had never owned anything that was worth having . Glancing round the spacious library , where the handsome sets of books were never taken out of the formidable modernyet still Jacobean bookcases , he sighed regretfully becausepossessions , like the spirit of the possessor , are not incorruptible . The house , he mused behind his evening paper , had cost him a small fortune , because , naturally , the plan of it had been left to the costlier architects and its furnishing to the more expensive interior decorators . All William had insistedupon was that the place should equal , as he said , thep115price he was paying for it ; and this insistence had borne much opulent fruit , both within and without , inasmuch as two formal gardens , one Italian and one Japanese , now enhancedhis surroundings . " Which garden do you prefer ? " a landscape gardener , brought at great expense from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haughtily , for by this time his avarice had collapsed in its weakest spot , " What 's the matter with having both ? " So he had both , and with them , a profusion of varied flower-beds arranged in geometrical patterns , which the landscape gardener described as " floral background . " Gardenersand decorators , William soon discovered , were all partial to " backgrounds " ; and since the term sounded expensive , he decided that an investment in such purely ornamentalvalues might in time yield a profit . Leaning back on the plum-colored velvet cushions of his chair , he let his predatory gaze wander searchingly over the walls of the room . Then , abruptly , his eyes narrowed to mere slits of light , while he stared at the imposing bookcase behind his wife 's yellowish gray head . " My dear , have you been at that bookcase ? " he asked testily . " The row on the third shelf from the top is un-even . " Charlotte bounced on her cushions . Whenever William addressed her as " my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , William , I have n't been near it . " " Has anybody been dusting those books ? " " Why , no , William . Fanny would n't think of taking out the books unless I was watching her . " Though no one , least of all her husband , would have attributed to her such an organ , Charlotte possessed , in reality , a mind of more than ordinary dimensions . It is true that feminine dissimulation ,  | combined with the flattening influence of marriage , had subdued its activities ; yet her rational part continued to exercise , in discreet silence , both passive intelligence and a critical faculty . " It may have been Craig , " she murmured , in the apologetic tone she had employed for fifty years with but moderate success . " He was down here quite a while yesterday when Stanley was upstairs with me . " William snorted over his paper . " That 's who it was then . He can never leave books alone . " " Books alone , " echoed his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew too well the unhappy consequences of disagreeing with her William . " You can never tell what he 's up to . " William 's tone was becoming irascible . " There 's a screw loose somewhere , and , to save my life , I ca n't see why Stanley is throwing herself away . The truth is , " he snorted explicitly , " I never could stomach the fellow . " Charlotte nodded in assent ; on the subject of Craig she had no wish to argue with William . " It is one of those queer infatuations nobody can see any reason for . Stanley is n't very bright , but she is unusually headstrong . " " Well , she 's bright enough . Too much sense only makes trouble for a woman . " A smile , sly , furtive , and as it appeared to his wife , a well-oiled smile , had puckered his large loose mouth . He was recalling Stanley 's young face , coloredlike a rose , he thought tenderly ; for there was a strain of poetry in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modern direction . His wife could observe his thoughts as plainly as if they were exotic goldfish swimming in a glass bowl ; but she continued to regard him with the serene tolerance of the completely disillusioned.  | " I hope it will turn out better than we expect , " she remarked , as she picked up a loop of wool . " It wo n't . " William rustled his paper . " Ten chances to one , a marriage turns out exactly as you expect , unless , " he added concisely , " it turns out worse . " " Anyway , we need n't worry about Stanley . I ca n't imagine a situation when she would n't come out on top . I suppose that 's because she 's so pretty , " Charlotte added , with one of her sagacious flashes of insight , " and because men make most of the situations in life . " " The little imp ! " William said , but he said it gently . " What was it Craig called her the other night ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head sometimes . " Charlotte , who knitted without looking at her needles , did not answer immediately . At the moment , she was busily wondering how women could have survived marriage throughout the ages if knitting had not been invented , and probably by a man . The ubiquitous cigarette , which scented the modern institution so strongly , appeared to her an inadequatesubstitute . For knitting composed the mind ; knittingserved the necessary means of evasion ; knitting constitutednot only an escape , but a tangible protection , from husbands . Not that she meant to be harsh upon husbands in general . Even William had his good points as a provider ; and in her sensible way she was really attached to him , as one becomes attached to a bed , however uncomfortable , in which one has slept , or tried vainly to sleep , for more than fifty years . To be sure , though he had suppliedher with every luxury she did not want , he was disposed to be near about ready money ; and there were frequentoccasions when she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her pocket . But one ca n't have everything , she reasoned , and after all , she was able to manage . Early in her married life , she had learned that the ways of circumventing a husband are many and varied . They required diplomacy , it is true ; but , what with one thing and another , whether it was a secret negotiation with butchers or an adroit subtraction from the household accounts , she had contrived to keep a tidy sum put away as a nest-egg . " Something about a savage , " William was muttering . " Something about the old savage and the new freedom . . . " " I thought it was the old siren , William , and the new freedom . Of course , he was chaffing . Craig is simply distracted about her . " " Maybe so . Maybe so , " grumbled William , who did not take kindly to any correction . " But I 've missed her about today . Busy with her new finery , I reckon . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask if we 'd seen her . She sounded worried about something . " " Worried ? " William turned from the financial to the editorialpage , and prepared to inform himself on the state of human behavior . " Well , there 's plenty to worry her . All she 's got to do is to pick up a newspaper and glance over the market . Bless my soul , Charlotte , the radio is n't on . I thought something was wrong . " With an obedient sigh , Charlotte rose from her chair , and holding her knitting in one hand , moved cautiously to the radio , which began , after a minute , to blare out an immelodioustorrent of sound . " I sometimes think it gives me a headache , " she said , raising her voice . " Headache ? Fish ! Tush ! I do n't know what 's come over women today . They 're nothing in the world but a mass ofp119nerves . What 's that about Roy ? " he shouted above the tumult . " You were saying something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may have imagined it . " Pushing her chair farther away from the radio , Charlottesettled herself on the cushions and passed a weary hand over her forehead . Why , she wondered pathetically , were men so ond of noise , and of discords in particular ? It was like trying to talk in a high wind . A pain as sharp as the thrust of a needle stabbed into her bosom and was gone in an instant . It was nothing , the doctor said , the merest twinge of neuritis ; but her florid face turned pale , and she remembered , as if it were yesterday , the dreadful years when her mother and her aunt lay dying of cancer . " I 'm fond of Roy , " she added , at a higher pitch . " She 's an honestlittle thing , and she 's very attractive too . " " Yes , she 's honest , " William assented , without enthusiasm ; for honesty , though commendable in principle and in its place , is not an endearing quality in women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Charlotte rejoined , absent-mindedly counting her stitches . " I mean , everybody has always made such a difference between her and Stan-ley . " William scowled . " If Stanley takes my fancy , I ca n't help it . There 's something about Stanley . " " I know . " His wife nodded patiently , while she looped the wool over her finger . " Yes , there 's something taking about her . " " I can tell you what 's wrong with Roy . " William dropped his paper and thrust out a long admonitory forefinger , which , though rheumatic in the joints , was still eloquent in gesture . " She 's too modern . And I can tell you what 's wrong with the whole modern outlook , from A to izzard . There's not an ounce of religion in the younger generation . . . " He broke off , spluttering slightly , while the radio spluttered still louder , and then stopped short as if it were winded . " Not an ounce , " he bellowed , gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . " Religion ? " his wife echoed , in confusion , as if the idea were new to her . Yes , it was true , she supposed , though she had never thought of the young as needing religion , because they always had so much else . For the elderly , especially for the elderly with husbands who were even more elderly but refused to admit it , she considered faith indispensable . How could I ever have stood William , she found herself thinking , if I had n't had something to fall back on ? Not , she repeated , that she was n't attached to William , and proud of him , too , after the inexplicable fashion of wives ; but there was no use in denying that God had helped her to stand him . William , who had been grunting irritably to himself , burst out , presently , in an explosion of anger . " I never could make out what anybody sees in him . I mean , that fellow Craig , with his rattlebrained , stuffed-up , crackpot ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take away what I 've got and hand it over to some trifling half-wit who never lifted a finger except to light a cigarette or cast a vote . " When he had exhausted his wind , and not till then , Charlottemurmured gently , " That was before he met Stanley . All he thinks of now is giving Stanley everything that she wants . " William started to grumble again , but in the middle of the snuffling noise , he was seized by a sudden jovial humor . " Well , it will take a better living than he 'll ever make , top121do that . But what does she see in him ? I ask you that . What can anybody see in him ? " " He 's attractive , in his way , I suppose . The girls were all silly about him at first . They thought him so romantic . " She paused , smoothed out the baby 's blanket over her plump knees , and added impressively , " His father is well-off , is n't he ? " " So-so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then let most of it slip through his fingers . Had n't sense enough to hold on to what he 'd got . " Stopping between breaths , William drew out a white silk handkerchief and snorted into its ample folds . " The trouble with the fellow , sir "  --  he always addressed her as " sir " when he was in a scolding vein  --  " is that he has no guts . . . " A shadow rather than a sound made her turn quickly , to find that Beavers , the new English butler , had materialized , like the spirit of Empire , beside the radio , which had become prophetically ominous over the European situation . Though Beavers spoke in his usual smooth undertones , his low voice was audible above the international jeremiad . Havingreceived the message , Mrs. Fitzroy passed it on to her husband , who had plunged back behind his paper . " Beavers says Parry Clay asks to speak to you . " The paper was lowered sufficiently for a bald head and a pair of bushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to say , let him come in , Beavers . " " Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . " Beavers faded obsequiously into air , while his mistress reflected , I 'll never get used to English servants ; they do n't seem quite human . The thought was still in her mind when Parry slipped noiselessly into the room . Or was it only the rage of foreign oratory that made everything else soundless by contrast ?  | " Come in , Parry , " she said kindly . " Mr. Fitzroy will speak . to you . " If only he would n't look so dumb and sullen , she said to herself , for William liked cheerful Negroes . But was the boy really a Negro ? she asked , startled , while her trained perceptions skimmed lightly over ethnological problems . Parry 's father looked as white as William , or more so , because ill health had darkened William 's skin and pouched the loose flesh under his eyes . Somewhere , a long time before , white blood had come in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in , apparently , it had never quite departed . But white blood , though Charlottehad heard that it was less sanguine than black , would not necessarily make the boy appear so gloomy and  --  well , yes , vaguely tragic . He looks lost , she told herself pityingly , for hers was a generous heart . He looks confused and lost , as if he were trying to find his way . She wished she could help him ; he had a good face , she decided , in spite of his brooding expression . " Well , Parry , " William said over his paper , " is there something you wish to see me about ? I hope there 's nothing wrong with Miss Stanley 's car . " Though his tone was not unpleasant , it was edged with finality . Hearing that familiar accent , William 's wife told herself that whatever the boy wanted , he would not find it . in her husband . While she fumbled for an instant over her knitting-needles , she felt devoutly thankful that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt doubly thankful , she added after a pause , that William had not been alive in the ages of slavery . For there were traits in William to which the solemn marriage ceremony had never reconciled her completely , and the chief of these , she had decided longip123ago , was William 's unfortunate manner with the poor and with animals . They waited in silence for Parry to answer , while he stood there , in his clean striped shirt and neatly patched suit , as if some hostile element in the room had turned him into wood . His dark , melancholy eyes looked enormous , she thought , and curiously opaque , as if the light splintered back without sinking into the pupils . I believe he is frightened , she said to herself . He is frightened of William . But she had watched the effect of William upon the helpless too often to wonder about it . " What is it , Parry ? " she prompted , fearing that William might become testy again and make it harder for everybody . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know your father and mother are proud of you . " Light appeared to grow rather than flash in his face . She watched it deepen under the skin while his features became surprisingly animated . He is like a foreigner , she decided , in astonishment , for she had never looked upon colored peopleas foreigners . A respectable foreigner , she added hastily , as if she were being unfair . " Yes , ma'am , " the boy replied , and then rushed on , recitingwords he had patiently committed to memory . " It 's about the school I came . I 'm sure to take a scholarship for next year , the teacher says , but that 's only for the classes , and if I can go on to Washington , I thought Mr. Fitzroy might lend me the money to live on . I 'll pay him back . I 'll pay him back every cent as sure as I live . " Leaning slightly forward , Mr. Fitzroy regarded him indulgently ; and to Mrs. Fitzroy , who had learned to interpret her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the indulgence of established refusal . She stirred uneasily , while124 IN THIS OUR LIFEp124she looped the wool over her finger , and the knitting-needles clicked on more rapidly , as if they were running a race with the minutes . " But I thought you had had schooling enough , " William said placidly . " You can read and write and do sums , I sup-pose . " " Yes , sir , but I want to get on . I want to go to college and then , if I take another scholarship , to Howard University . Pa could have helped me but for the bank failure last year . . . . But I 'll pay back every cent of it , sir . " The race slackened and paused for an instant , while Charlotteglanced up over her knitting . " It 's remarkable how well the boy has done , " she said , with the desperate courage of pity . " His teacher thinks he ought to be helped . " Of course , she told herself , as she broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever that was or was n't , but she did think they might have their own lawyers and doctors . When it came to that , she did n't know two finer characters than Minerva and Abel , but William would say that they belonged to the old school and had never tried to be " uppity . " Her husband turned his frosty glance on her and continuedas evenly as if there had been no interruption , " I am glad to have a good report of you , Parry , but I hope you wo n't let your head get chock-full of tomfool ideas about education . Your race does n't need lawyers . There are too many white lawyers already , and if any of you get into trouble that 's not your fault , your white friends are always ready to help you out . The best thing you can do is to turn your hand to some suitable work . There 's room for a good waiter or porter , or you might find a job as a postman , though that 's less easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my advice and do n't get fancy ideas in your head . There 's too much education , anyway . Too much foolishness out of books and too little old-fashioned religion . " He cocked a suspicious eye over his paper . " You go to church regularly , I hope . " Parry did not reply . He merely stood there , in a kind of downcast immobility , while the animation drained slowly out of his face and figure , and even out of the new blue cap which hung , limp as a rag , in his relaxed grasp . " You go to church , do n't you , Parry ? " Mrs. Fitzroy repeated . When she spoke , he looked at her with a bewildered expression , and it seemed to her that he plucked himself by force out of the little space he had filled in the room . A few minutes before she had turned off the radio , and she now found herself longing for the calm nasal tones of the announceror even for the furious clamor of oratory . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that William was still speaking his mind . " If you are n't afraid of work , " he was saying , " I 'll see what I can do . I 'll pay you for looking after Miss Stanley 's car in your spare time , but I have n't any money to throw away on tomfoolery . " " Yes , sir , " the boy said . Then , glancing at Mrs. Fitzroy , he added , " Yes , ma'am , " under his breath , before he turned and disappeared as soundlessly as he had come . Like a startled rabbit , Charlotte huddled on her cushions , and then bounced up impulsively . " Wait a minute , Parry , " she called . " I 've something to send your mother . " " Where 're you going , my dear ? " William asked , as if he had not been listening . Without answering him , she waddled , as she always did when she forgot herself , across the room , past the radio , which William had turned on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her knitting-bag , for she had learned to be prepared for William 's denials , and not a little of her pilferingfrom the household accounts was animated by justice or charity . She could n't do anything with William , she knew , but in small ways she had been able occasionally to outwit his designs . When she reached the servants ' dining-room , however , the boy was not there , and Beavers , moving softly in the pantry , said that he had hurried through without stopping . Fumblingin her bag , she thought , I might have given him a little money , but it would n't have been enough . . . And now there 's William . I 'll have to face William . . . There was a ring at the door as she scurried back into the library and ignored William 's peremptory , " What 's that ? Where 've you been , eh ? " While she flopped down in her chair , and nervously wound her ball of pink wool , she said in a voice which was drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Stanley and Craig ? " But it was only Asa , and the first thing she noticed about him was that he seemed worn out ( there was a fagged look in his eyes that reminded her of a jaded horse ) , and he was shabbier  --  or was it more seedy ?  --  than usual . Well , he had a hard life . Anybody who married Lavinia must have expected that . She had always been fond of him , and tonight her sympathy brimmed over in the hope that William would offer him a glass of sherry or a drink of his old Bumgardner . " So it 's you , Asa , " she said , vaguely motioning to a chair , while , for the hundredth time , it seemed to her , she stopped the radio . " You look tired . Would n't you like something ? We thought it might be Stanley and Craig . "  |p127Asa  shook his head , and she felt that the movement had rippled out in circles through the air of the room . Could there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much careless driving . Or was Lavinia having an actual instead of a sham heart attack ? It was a moment before Asa answered , and his voice , when at last he spoke , was so flattened in tone that it might have come from an inanimate object . So a piece of furniture might have spoken , she found herself imagining , if furniture had a voice . " No , I came to ask about Stanley . Did n't she spend last night with you ? " A growl broke from William , while his wife looked up in anxiety . " She was coming , but something must have prevented . William and I were just saying how much we had missed her . " She clipped off her sentence and looked at him expectantly . " Have n't you seen her tonight ? " " That 's why I came . I have n't seen her . I thought she might be here . I thought Roy might have misunderstood . . . . " " You mean you have n't been home ? " " Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Was n't she there ? " He shook his head , while the amused gleam in his eyes was washed out by a mist of pain . " She has n't been there since  --  since yesterday . " " But where is she ? " William was beginning to boom as he did when he was agitated . " Good God , man , what has happened ? " " I do n't know , " Asa replied soberly , and Charlotte remindedherself that , poor and unimportant as he was , he could not be bullied by William . He 's the quiet kind , she thought , but he 's stubborn enough to dig in his toes and hold his ground against everybody . " I do n't know , " he repeated . " I 'm trying to find out . " " When did she go out ? Was she in her car ? " " She went out in her car yesterday afternoon . Virgie says she was taking some dresses to be altered . She had a suitcase . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face seemed to have withered , and his large mottled hands , covered with coarse reddish hair on the back , were twitching over the newspaper . " The car 's in the garage . The dressmaker called up the house this morning and asked us to send for it . " " Where is she , then ? God alive , she 's got to be some-where ! " " Of course , she 's somewhere . " Charlotte spoke in the firm unsweetened tones she reserved for a crisis . " She ca n't possibly be lost . If she 'd had an accident , we should have heard from the hospital . " " She called a taxi . . . . " Asa uttered the words as if they were wrung out of him . " Mrs. Dayton says she had her call a taxi , and went off in it . " He hesitated and added in an expressionlessvoice , " She took the suitcase . " " But the dresses were to be altered . " " They were n't altered . She did n't open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Charlotte 's whisper drained away with a moaning sound . Yet , in spite of her horror of mystery , she could tell herself that she did not really love Stanley . William loved her in his peculiar way , which , strangely enough , seemed to her gluttonous ( yes , that was the only word for it ) , but his wife had never loved the child , not even when she was an adorable smiling baby in a cap and coat of white fur . It was William , notwithstanding his thick husk of vanity , who would be hurt by what hap/pened , or did not happen , to Stanley . For William loved his niece as an old man loves the remembered ecstasy of his youth . " Why , I saw her myself , " William growled , knotting his forehead until his eyebrows hung like tufts of dried grass over the blinking anger in his eyes . " I saw her as I was coming out yesterday afternoon . I was later than usual , and it must have been six o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way downtown in Peter 's car . Peter was driving , and , bless my soul , I noticed him because he almost ran into a truck at the corner of Seventh and Washington . Grazed it by an inch ! I called to Baxter to stop when the car skidded into the gutter . Rattlebrained driving , if ever I saw it , sir ! What I can never understand is how a man who drives like that should be able to cut up people without killing them . But they 're all rattlebrained now , the whole bunch of them . I was just saying to my wife when you came in that all this modern racket ( and Stanley 's no better than the rest of ' em ) sticks in my gizzard . . . " " Then Peter must know where she was going , " Charlotte murmured . " Why do n't you ask Peter ? " Asa smiled faintly , but his smile was scarcely more than an ironic flicker over the stiffened mask of his features . " We ca n't ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not come back ? Where 's he gone ? " thundered William . " He had a call out of town . Dr. Bellamy , I think he said , called him to operate . He told Roy he might not get home till this morning . But this morning he did n't come . He has not come tonight . " " It 's half-past nine now . " William drew out his watch and looked at it indignantly . " It 's a quarter to ten . " " He may still come , " Charlotte suggested feebly ,  | " I do n't know . " Asa 's gaze wandered round the room and came to rest on her bulging figure , seated , like some emblem of domestic security , on her plum-colored cushions . " I called up Bellamy . . . " " Well ? Well , I said , sir ! " William 's face had flushed from gray to purple , while he lifted a shaking hand to pluck unsteadilyat his collar button . Sliding from her chair to her uncertain feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass If water , which she held to her husband 's lips . This is the only thing , except his own flesh , that could hurt William , she thought . If anything has happened to Stanley . . . " He could n't tell me , " Asa answered slowly . " He did n't know . He said he had n't asked him to operate out of town . . . " " Had n't asked him ? Do you mean . . . ? " Asa moistened his lips , but they were still so stiff that he had to wait a minute before replying . " I do n't mean anything . I do n't know anything . I 'm in a . . . in a . . . " William 's features were suddenly convulsed , as if he were choking . " You 've got to mean something ! " he burst out . " Damn it all , sir , you 've got to mean something ! " The explosion left Asa unshaken . He was the color of wood that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself rambling , and the smudges under his eyes looked as if they had been rubbed in with charcoal . Men are so helpless in trouble , she thought , with a sigh . Why is it , when they spend all their lives facing facts , that they should never have learned how to meet an emergency ? " I thought you might have heard something , " Asa was saying.  | " But you ca n't think they 're together ! " Charlotte cried out . " You ca n't think she 's gone off with  --  with Peter . " Asa shook his head again . " I ca n't think . I 've stopped thinking . " " But Stanley could n't . She . . . she is n't . . . she is n't like that . " " I do n't know what she 's like . " Asa 's voice was hard and level . " I do n't know what anybody is like . " " She 's like all the others , " William stormed , while Charlotteunderstood , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her uneasy marriage , she had seen her husband stripped to the bone , stripped even of that masculine vanity which he had worn always like a protective layer of fat . " But if that girl . . . By God , Charlotte , if a niece of mine . . . " " Do n't , William . Please , William . " An impending namelessfear had yielded to the immediate horror of an apoplectic stroke under her very eyes . " You will make yourself sick . " A smothered gurgling and rumbling issued from William 's throat . " I tell you . . . I tell you . . . " Asa stood up and straightened his shoulders . " I 'll go now , " he said quietly . " There does n't seem to be anything else I can do . " " Where 's Craig ? " asked Charlotte , with her apprehensive glance on her husband . " Craig ? " It was the first moment that any of them had thought of Craig . " He 's waiting for me outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does he say ? " " He does n't say anything . What is there for him to say ? But I 'm not thinking of Craig . I 'm not thinking of Peter , damn him ! I 'm not thinking of Stanley ! I 'm thinking of Roy ! "  | His voice broke with anger , and turning away before they could stop him , he rushed out of the room and through the hall to the front door . With more anxiety than pain in her eyes , Charlotte stared after him . " We did n't give him a drink , William , " she said . " And I never saw a man who needed a drink more . "  |p133WAS  he tired of waiting ? Has he gone back without me ? Asa asked himself , as he stumbled down from the terrace and on through the April starlight in the Italian garden . Well , they were all alike , young people nowadays . They knew no law but their own impulses . It is hard to be young in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hard to be young ? Though not nearly so hard , he added at once , as it is to be old . . . . I ca n't find the car , he said aloud , feeling tired and angry , and as if he had caved in through the middle . He must have gone off and left me to get home as best I can . But no . Rounding a group of three cypresses , he saw the lights of the car at the end of the avenue , and a few minutes later Craig 's profile was outlined as sharply as if it were a projection from darkness . Black as night , he looked against the electric lamp in the road . Until Asa reached him , he neither spoke nor moved . Then , at the sound of his name , he tossed a dead cigarette from his fingers and put his hand on the wheel . " I was afraid you 'd gone , " Asa said , as he scrambled over the stones and into the car . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Craig did not answer . His face seemed to be moulded of hollows , dark hollows among which the shifting lights from t he road sank and were absorbed . It might have been a skull beside him , Asa thought , a skull bared of flesh and yet curiously animate . Once , when he glanced round , the light roving eyes looked as shallow as glass in their sockets , and as empty of all expression . He has n't spoken three words ,  | Asa told himself . He seems to have lost the power of speech  --  or never to have possessed it . Yet speech , not action , had been Craig 's natural expression . He had been enslaved by words , so long as words were only the vehicle of impersonal forces . Now , when to speak would mean tearing out a part of himself , he was overwhelmed by a kind of dumb agony . The pity is , Asa thought , that he 's futile . Like all the rest of us , like our world , our time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is incapable of any permanent motive . Ideas may matter to him , but they do not matter enough . He has never known what he believed . Or is it that he has never really believed anything ? Feeling has eaten him through and through , and there has been nothing hard and strong in him to resist it . They are all like that , and so am I , Asa told himself , only they have the freedom for destruction , and I was kept always in chains . I may have lost my beliefs , but the empty forms of my beliefs are still holding me . And Roy would have nothing left , not even these vague impressions , to live by . Oh , Roy , Roy . . . But Asa could n't think of her . There were things that would n't bear thinking about . Anybody but Roy might have been hurt , Roy , the core of his heart , he thought , repeating a phrase he had read somewhere . He loved Stanley , as he loved Andrew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching Craig 's reckless hands on the wheel , the core of his heart . Aloud he said : " We 'd better go straight home . She may have got there before us . After all , so many things may have happened . " Craig nodded , without turning his head . " That 's what I 've been telling myself . " The car shot out of the side road and turned in the direction of Queenborough . They sped past a service station , pastp135a second service station , past a row of small houses with unkempt yards , past a butcher shop , a greengrocer , a corner drugstore , and the unsightly stumps of what had once been a fine row of maples . How we hate beauty , Asa meditated , diverting his thoughts . How we hate order . . . Yes , it was true , as he had said to Craig , anything might have happened . The car  --  Peter 's car  --  might have broken down . She might have decided to spend the night with a friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must keep his mind on the bare facts ; he must refuse to imagine . Glancing round , he asked himself what Craig was feeling . What was he thinking ? What was he imagining ? Carved out of bone , Craig might have been , with that lean , blank face jutting out between flashes of light and darkness , arrested , immobile , solitary . A changeable face which had been petrified into a look of mortal despair ; into a look which was caught and held fast before it could break up with surprise or pleasure or anguish . He was keeping it back , too , that incredible probability  --  thethought they evaded and denied even while they acknowledged its truth . What could she have found in Peter ? Asa wondered . What is there about him that is different from Craig , or from the rest of us ? A few months ago , she was apparently infatuated with Craig ; but she had drained him dry in the end , and the end , after all , was barely more than the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for excitement , for renewal , for an inexhaustible charm against tedium or satiety . Or had the sight of Roy 's happiness ( Asa flinched from the question ) aroused a secret destructive instinct , which still survived , under the sham called civilization , in most men and women ? Not that anything mattered now . Digging for reasons could help nothing and prevent nothing . The reason had lain there all the time , while they set up ineffectual pretensesand trusted vainly to a philosophy of evasive idealism , A collection of good impulses , of right intentions , without the necessary balance of power . . . " Look out ! " he called sharply , for they had grazed a truck and just missed a dog in the road . " Look out , or you 'll kill something ! " Craig laughed on a jarring note . " I 'd like to kill something . But not a dog . I 've nothing against dogs . " They were speeding down Granite Boulevard , and Asa waited , impatiently , for the abrupt turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , his mind , running in a narrow groove , like a tunnel , had seen a triangle of light in the distance . Was it in another life or only a few hours ago that he had set out to find Stanley ? First , the telephone to the hospitals ; then the dressmaker 's and the garage ; then to Fitzroyal , the Fitzroy place in the suburbs . It seemed to him now that these hours had nothing to do with reality , no part or place in the flux and reflux of time . Things like this do n't happen to people like us , he thought stubbornly . They simply do n't happen . Aloud he said , " They may be waiting at home for us now . " " Or in a hospital . " " But we telephoned . " " She may have been brought in later . " " But we should have had word . " " Not if they did n't know . Not if she is unconscious . " " But some one must have been with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , we 'll be there in a minute . The house looks all right . " " There 's a light in the living-room . " " And in her mother 's room upstairs . If she 's come back , she will be with her mother . "  | " God ! " said Craig under his breath , and then over again in the same deadened voice , " God ! " The car stopped with a jerk . Holding his latchkey in his hand , Asa ran up the steps and opened the door . Behind him , he heard Craig breathing in short gasps , and each breath sounded as if it were struggling to break free in a spasm of pain . The hall was dimly lighted , and there was a single lamp turned on in the living-room . At the noise of the slamming door , a figure appeared on the staircase , and because the dress was green and the glow behind it merely a faint shimmer , Asa imagined , for an instant , that it was Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here is Stanley ! " Craig 's breath was suddenly suspended , and then went on again with a shudder . He did not speak ; but the figure on the upper landing descended slowly to meet them , and Asa saw that he had mistaken Roy for Stanley . She moved as if she were frozen into stillness , and her features wore a graven look , remote and inaccessible , as if she were withdrawn from a share in any of the things that happened around her . Her lips were tight and straight , but they were vividly reddened , and the look in her tired eyes was still bright and defiant . A thought jerked through his mind . She can face anything that comes . She can face anything without giving way . " You looked like Stanley in that green dress , " he said . " Has Stanley come back ? " A bitter little laugh answered him . " Did you expect her ? " " We hoped she might . . . " How foolish the phrase sounded ! " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to him that the only living thing left in her was that derisive voice . " Mother wants to see you , " she said . " And you , too ,  | Craig . She 's had a letter . It came by special delivery , just after you went out . " " A letter ? Then there was n't an accident ? " He had to make some sound , Asa told himself ; yet every word he uttered only added to his helplessness , his sense of inward futility . " Oh , no , there was n't an accident . " She turned back up the stairs , and went on ahead of them to the second floor and into her mother 's room . Her shoulders were straight ; her head was high ; but she moved blindly , as if she were walking in her sleep and had left her direction to some safe instinct . Her remoteness , he knew , was merely an attitude , a protective barrier which she had placed between her and life . Beneath the stonelike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying inertly back on her pillows , which had been raised to support the weight of her head . There was despair in her face , and she held an open letter in her relaxed grasp . " I 've heard from Stanley , " she began , and burst into tears . " But I can not believe it . Oh , Asa , I can not believe itAsa seized the letter , which was very short , and read it with a glance , while Craig stared down over his shoulder . With the words whirling in black specks before his eyes , Asa could hear that hoarse murmur , like the panting of a man who has run a hard race and lost . " Dearest Mother , " We ca n't keep on like this any longer , Peter and I. I am sorry to hurt you , and to hurt Roy and Craig , but we ca n't go on , except with each other . When we feel this way we have to be together , and nothing else matters . I could neverp139have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . " I hope Roy will get over it and live her own life . She is so strong and brave , but she and Peter are not the least bit alike . " Darling Mother , I do hate to hurt you , " Stanley . " " Nothing else matters , " Asa repeated slowly , and choked over a lump that felt as hard and dry as a cinder . " Damn him ! " Craig cried out in torture . " Damn them both ! Damn everybody ! " " Craig ! " Lavinia wept reproachfully , and broke into louder sobs . " My poor child , what will become of her ? " Asa looked again at the letter . There was no date and no address ; it had been posted , apparently , when the train stopped in Washington , or when they stopped there in Peter 's car . While the paper shook in his hand , he felt that his empty stomach had turned suddenly and he might be sick without warning . I 've eaten nothing since breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black chill inside me . His ribs seemed to be closing together , but , after an effort , he was able to summon his mind back from the edge of a void . " It 's Roy I 'm thinking of , " he heard a hollow voice saying , and recognized it as his own . " He has ruined Roy 's life . " Roy , who had been standing by the window , turned quickly and came over to him . " But he has n't , Father , " she said , and there was a bright edge of steel in her tone . " We were both free . I would n't have stood in his way . He knew I 'd never have held on to him . He had a right to go if . . . if . . . " The edge of steel snapped in two . " Roy ! " her mother gasped , struggling to raise herself.  | " Roy , do you know what you 're saying ? Asa , do you hear what the child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says wo n't do any harm  --  or any good either . " With a quavering moan , Lavinia sank back again . " That 's the cause of it all . Roy has always encouraged Peter in his . in his . . . " " There , there , Lavinia . " Asa turned from Roy 's frozen brightness to the tragic gloom of Craig 's features . " That does n't help anybody . " Craig , who had said nothing since Lavinia rebuked him , burst out with an inarticulate exclamation , as if he had lost both the power of speech and the verbal pattern of thought . The sound , so burdened with misery , was like the longdrawncry of an animal in a trap . Startled , they looked at him , and Asa said , " You 're ill , Craig . Do n't you need a drink ? " Craig gazed at them stupidly for an instant . Then he answereddeliberately , as if he were speaking words in a foreigntongue . " Yes , I need a drink . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huddled in his clothes , his long , loose figure seemed to have shrunk and dwindled down to the bony structure . " Then we 'll go downstairs . " Asa caught his arm at the elbow and drew him away . " There 's nothing we can do . Nothing but telephone William and Andrew . " At this , Lavinia collected her strayed faculties . " William will know what to do , " she said . " Tell him to make some excuse for the newspapers . The wedding was to have been in four  --  no , three days . Everybody . . . everybody . . . " " For God 's sake , stop talking , " Craig called back from the hall . " It 's the time for drink , now . "  | " Do n't mind him , " Asa said warningly . " He 's off his head , poor devil . Somebody ought to look after him . " As he followed Craig out of the room , he turned and glanced back at Roy , who looked tearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbreakable . An instant later , while he descended the stairs , he heard Lavinia 's wailing lament , " Oh , Roy , this will kill me ! How can I live through it ? " Well , he would go back as soon as he could get rid of Craig without hurting his feelings  --  if any feelings were left in that skeleton . What feeble folk are human beings in a crisis , he told himself , especially modern human beings . They made crises , and then , having made them , they lost control and began to call on the invisible Powers . Craig had switched on the light , and the dining-room and pantry were flooded with the soulless glare of electricity . He had already brought out the glasses , and he waited impatientlywhile Asa found a bottle of whisky and a halfemptiedsiphon of soda water . " No water , " Craig said . Then after pouring the whisky into his glass , he pushed it away from him and looked up angrily . " It is n't Peter 's , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent this down . There is n't any of Peter 's . " Craig 's fingers were shaking , and the glass had to be held to his lips for the first swallow . When he had tossed off the whisky in a gulp , and was holding out his glass for refilling , he began to ramble on more coherently . To Asa 's astonishment , the drink , which would have paralyzed him almost at once , appeared only to sober Craig and to steady his nerves . " You 'd better take a bite , " Asa said , offering some cheese and biscuits he had found in a cupboard . " If your stomach 's as empty as mine , it wo n't stand it . "  | " I could do with another drink . " Asa withdrew the bottle . " You ca n't get into a car with all that whisky inside you . " " I do n't care . I do n't care a damn what happens to me . " " I 'm not thinking of you . I 'm thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sober . I 'm perfectly sober . I do n't even feel it . " " You may in five minutes . " " You think I 'm drunk ? Good God , you could n't make me drunk if you tried . " " I 'm not trying . How much had you had before you came for me ? " Craig shook his head . " I do n't know . I 've been trying to get drunk , and I ca n't . Do you know what that means ? I want to get drunk , and I ca n't . . . not on whisky . . . " The young fool has no stamina , Asa thought . He could never hold his breath under water . Asa remembered he had once asked his father what kind of man dominated a crisis in history , and that Daniel Timberlake had answered : " The man who can hold his breath longest under water . " But Craig , for all his fine impulses , would always be swept away by emotion . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or without . A generous chap , but ineffectual to the bone , Asa told himself , a true child of a dying age , one of the predestined victims of life . If only Craig hats been stronger , he might have held Stanley , who was parasitic by nature , and would instinctively cling to the victor . But he had lacked the insight to perceive that Stanley could surrender to nothing weaker than the touch of brutality . Over his glass , which he had half-filled , Craig was looking at Asa in sardonic despair . " I 'll have to spend the night inp143that apartment , I 'll have to spend the night in the midst of all the things we picked up together . " " Would n't you rather stay here ? " Asa grasped his arm as if to drag him back from some act of blind desperation . " You may sleep in the spare room . I 'll get it ready . " But he was thinking : And Roy will have to spend the night among Peter 's things . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll try to move some of those things out . Or I can sleep up there and make her stay with her mother . Her mother will need her . " No , I 'll leave my car and walk home . I ca n't kill anybody in three blocks on foot . " " Well , I 've got to eat , " Asa said grimly . " If the skies fall , I 've got to eat . " After rummaging in the ice-box , he brought out a collection of beef scraps which Virgie had saved for hash . " Take a bite of this . " He put the dish on the table and began cutting the crust from a loaf of bread . " You need something solid . " " I do n't want anything . I 'm as sober as  --  as hell . Hell does n't get drunk . " Dragging a chair to the pantry table , Asa placed a slice of beef on the crust and began eating ravenously . " A vacuumwo n't help you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't want to think . There 's nothing to think about . " " You ca n't live with a vacuum . " " I do n't want to live . There 's nothing to live for . " " Maybe so , " Asa nodded . " But it is n't easy to die . And , anyway , you never know how good scraps can taste till your stomach has caved in . " Taking the bottle from Craig , he measured out a moderate drink and squirted into it a dash of soda water from the siphon . That hit the exact right spot , he said to himself , when he had tossed off the drink ; and the exact right spot was somewhere in an undistributed middle . There would be no hash for breakfast ; but Virgie would find an egg for Lavinia , and Roy and he could always make out on next to nothing . " I feel a new man , " he said aloud . " It 's amazing how much one 's courage depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really physical ? But no . He had seen too much starving fortitude to admit that . " I 'd as well be getting on , " Craig said . " Not that it mat-ters . " " Do n't let go , Craig . Try to hold on . Nobody knows what the future may bring . " Did one always , at the end , fall back upon platitude ? " Nothing that I want . Nothing that will make any " dif-ference . " " You 're young . You have the only two things that really matter , youth and health . " Since he was no longer empty , Asa said to himself , it was easier to feel hopeful . But the platitude was true , after all . Youth could never stay beaten . Youth has no finality . If only he does n't try to find a way out ! He is too confused , poor devil , to see where he is going . " Here 's to youth and health ! " Craig grinned mockingly . " Anyway , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wish you 'd stay , " Asa urged ; for he was worrying over what might happen in that empty apartment . " Sorry , but I 'd rather not . " Following him to the front door , Asa watched anxiously while Craig hurried on , through patches of light and darkness , to the next crossing . He walked , as he had said , a straight line , with his shoulders erect and his bare head flungp145tick . Perhaps the whisky would take effect later on . Or it might be that his mental agony was immune from any form of physical intoxication . Another ruined life , Asa thought , glancing up at the indifferentheavens . And God only knows why !  |p146AS  Asa closed the door and shot the bolt into the socket , he reminded himself that Lavinia waswaiting for him to bring her a cup of milk . Noteven the ruin of four young lives could alter the inexorable logic of custom . Meals must still be served and eaten , or left uneaten , at the usual hours ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after getting up ; and all this irksome tyranny of little habits would presently dissolve and mingle in some thick deposit of days , months , years . The slow dust of time would drift in and settle ; one would cease to remember and go on again as if nothing had altered . In the kitchen he touched a match to the gas-jet and put " on the milk in a blue saucepan . He was still stirring it aimlessly , when the door into the pantry swung open and Roy came in . " I 've just given Mother some veronal . She may get quietaftershe 's had her hot milk . " " I 'm heating it now . Craig stayed some time . He 's a broken man , Roy . " Roy 's lips hardened . " He would be . He 's the brittle sort . " Her face , under the light , was like a waxen mask , and her dry-eyed gaze reminded him of the unblinking detachment of the dead . He dropped the spoon and put out his hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare you this , Roy . " She flinched away , as if his tenderness hurt her . " Do n't pity me , " she said harshly . " I will not be pitied . " " But I must suffer with you . " " You must n't . I do n't want you to suffer with me . " " I 'm your father , darling . How can I help it ? "  |p147She  shook her head obstinately while she drew farther away from him . " I wo n't get soft . If I let myself get soft , I 'm done for . . . " As he looked at her in silence , she added in a metallic voice , without modulation or cadence , " I have to face things my own way . Nobody can help me . I do n't want help . I do n't want pity . I 'd rather die than be pitied . " " But I ca n't let you go , my child . I must keep as close to you as I can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart broken . . . " She turned on him fiercely , though he could see the cold despair in her eyes . " Why will you and Mother never really grow up ? Nobody talks that way any longer . My life is n't ruined . Nobody could ruin my life . . . . And I wo n't have them hounding Peter . He knew he was free to leave me whenever he wanted to . We had agreed to that when we were married . He knew I 'd never try to hang on to him . I despise women who hang on to men . . . " " It was more than marriage , darling . There was responsibility , and integrity , and . . . " She laughed scornfully . " Words , words , and they mean nothing . They have never meant anything . But I do n't care . I will not have Uncle William and you and Andrew hounding Peter . . . " " But Stanley ? " A spark flickered in his eyes at the picture of himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need n't worry about Stanley . She will always be taken care of . There will always be some man , or more likely two men , to look after her . " " She 's weak , Roy , and you are strong . The weak have always had the strong to protect them . But the strong must protect themselves or go under . "  | " Well , I 'll save myself . Nobody , not even Peter , is going to spoil my life . As for Stanley . . . " She broke off ; and he said unhappily : " The hardest thing for me to believe is that family feeling no longer means any thing , for better or worse . It has done harm enough , I know , but at least it held things together when the world rocked . Anyway , the family as a unit now seems to be only another habit that has played out . " " Well , I 'm not obliged to love my enemies because they happen to be related to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have nothing to do with it . He is living his own life . " " He ca n't unless you give him his freedom . " " He 's free now . I 'll never stand in his way . Craig is a lawyer . . . " Her laugh pierced his heart . " He may be glad to arrange it . " " Do n't , Roy ! For God 's sake . I ca n't bear it . . . " " Poor Father . " Her voice wavered , but the next instant she had regained control of it . " If you love me , you must leave me alone . I have to work things out in my own way . I have to save myself as I can . It may not be the right way , but it 's mine . " That was only the truth . Her enemy , he knew , was within the heart ; for she was at the mercy of some antagonist more hostile than the mere abstraction called life . Her own will must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solitude . She belongs to another age , he thought ; she is a part of the future , and I am still encrusted with the outworn shape of the past . I can not share either her joy or her grief ; all I can do is to stand aside and sympathize from a distance . She is stronger than any of us , and finer in many ways ; but she lacks tenderness  --  or is it merely imagina/Lion ? She is riding a single virtue , the new gallantry , too hard  --  perhaps to self-destruction . Who knows ? He felt that he had come suddenly to the brink of a precipice ; and he could not see into the gulf that divided two hemispheres . Was it light there ? Was it darkness ? Was it another dawn ? Or was it but a quite old ending masked as a new beginning ? " I know , " he said , " and , Roy , I understand  --  only . . . " She slipped from his grasp . " You 'd better stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with a thudding heart , he dipped the spoon into the saucepan and began to stir very slowly , as if life or death were contained in Lavinia 's cup . Then , lifting the saucepan from the flame , he carefully poured the contents into the small pitcher beside the cup on the tray . A few drops spilled over into the saucer , and he wiped them off before he picked up the tray and started to the door . " Will you stay with your mother tonight , " he asked , " and let me sleep upstairs ? " Without looking at him , she made a gesture of impatience . " I 've got to face things . I ca n't face things that way . " " But you 'll sit by her till she 's quiet ? " " If she 'll stop talking . " Irritation ruffled her toneless voice . " If she wo n't stop talking , I 'll want to murder her . " " Did n't the veronal help ? " " I did n't wait to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up before it gets cold . " She held the swinging door open , while he went through with the tray held in front of him . " Do n't let yourself get too hard , darling . " She smiled and shook her head . " Hard things do n't break easily . " Looking back over his shoulder , as he went out of the kitchen , he caught the flash of cold disillusion which lit up her features and now faded into a sullen reserve . There was nothing to answer , he told himself , in an anguish of pity . What answer could there ever be to life 's betrayal of youth ? Lavinia had been put to bed by Roy , and she was now dozing , mercifully benumbed , in a state between two borders of consciousness , the dream and the actuality . Walking softly , he crossed the room and spoke to her in a whisper . " Are you awake , Lavinia ? " Raising her eyelids , she moaned under her breath , " I feel sick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will make the veronal act quicker . " Slipping his arm under the pillows , he lifted her head and held the cup to her lips , while an erratic thought skimmed through his mind . Damn it all , I was n't made for a nurse . . . . A smell of mustard , from a plaster at the back of her neck , stung his nostrils , and for an instant , evoked by an illusion of memory , the head on the pillow became the head of his mother . Then the phantom receded , and he looked down , in resentful pity , on the face of Lavinia . With that look , he knew that he was bound to her only by an empty form which he lacked either the courageor the cruelty to break . For the rest , there was nothing . He had ceased to love her ; he had ceased even to like her . She was less , or more , than a stranger to him ; she was an intimate enemy . " My poor child ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become of her ? " Her head rolled back on the pillows , and she appeared to be falling asleep . Then starting up , in an effort to spring out of bed , she cried frantically : " I must go to her , Asa ! Somebody must go to her . " p 151 " Try not to think , Lavinia , " he said , reproaching himself . " We ca n't do anything before morning . " " Have you telephoned Uncle William ? " " I have n't had time . I could n't leave Craig alone while he was trying to drink himself into a stupor . " " Then Andrew does n't know ? " " I 'll call up both of them as soon as you 've dropped off There is n't anything they can do tonight . " " Poor Craig , " Lavinia sighed , " he loves her . " " Yes , he loves her , God help him . " " I ca n't find it in my heart to be hard on her , Asa . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed off until it was scarcely more than a breath . " Stop talking , Mother , " Roy said . " If you do n't stop talking , the veronal wo n't do any good . " " You 're so strong , Roy . I do n't know what any of us would do without you . " " For God 's sake , stop talking ! " " I feel so wretched . I feel that I do n't want to live . . . " " Well , you are n't dying , but you 'd better be quiet . " " I 'm suffering with you , too , my child . " Lavinia 's voicesounded as if she were rambling in her sleep . " Do n't thinkthat I . . . " A spasm of anger distorted Roy 's features . " Then you may as well stop . I can do my own suffering . " Pushing back the chair by the bed , she went over to the window and leaned out to meet the approaching rain . " It 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so heavy I ca n't get my breath . " " Yes , it feels like summer , " Asa said . " The rain will help . There 'll be rain in a minute now . Roy , you 'd better put down that window . "  | " I do n't mind , " Roy answered , without turning . As the rain came down in a singing rush against the street lamp , she held up her face to the wind-blown shower . " Come away , Roy . You 'll be soaked . " " I do n't mind , " Roy repeated again , without turning ; but when he touched her arm , she followed him back to the bed and sat down by her mother . " It will be soon over , " he said , " and everything will be better after the rain . " " After the rain , " Roy echoed tauntingly , " everything will be better . " As the sedative began gradually to take effect , Lavinia 's voice rose , and wavered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A branch had blown down from a maple ; the light at the corner was darkened ; leaves were torn off and hurled down in drenched clusters from the swaying trees . " My poor misguided child , what will become of her ? " Another pause , and then a lower moan , " My poor child . . . " A longer silence broken by a still feebler moan , " My poor misguided . . . " Then an inarticulate sighing into unconsciousness . " Are the windows down upstairs ? " Asa asked in a whisper . " No , I left them open , " Roy replied listlessly . " Then it must be raining in . Stay with your mother till I come back . " Roy looked at him vacantly , as if raining in were the last thing that mattered . Except for an almost imperceptible turn of her head , he would not have known that she heard him ; but as he passed her on his way out of the room , he saw that the hands lying in her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hurried up the narrow stairs top153Roy 's bedroom , where the floor was splashed with water and the wind was twisting the soaked curtains . As he went over to lower the window , the brown muslin curtains whipped in his face , and he was obliged to struggle against the gusts before he could shut out the storm . When at last all the windows were shut , he mopped the floor with some bathtowels ; and then standing up with the dripping towels in his hands , he looked about him for any signs of Peter 's possessionsthat might be safely removed . He must have known he was going , Asa thought angrily . He must have taken most of his things away before Roy came in . For an instant , alone in the room , he felt that his heart was bursting with rage ; and he knew , with a blinding flash of insight , that it was in the nature , if not in the will , of every man to do murder . Below the disintegrated surface of character , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't know it was in me , he thought . I wonder if all other men are like that in the depths ? Opening the closet door , he took down the few clothes , mostly heavy suits , that Peter had left . When he had bundledthem over his arm , he stooped to pick up several pairs of half-worn shoes , while the thought darted through his mind that every pair of old shoes was endowed with a curioussemblance of personality . I must get rid of these before she comes upstairs , he said in a furious whisper . I must get rid of everything he has left . At any minute , Asa knew , Roy might become suspicious and follow him to the upper floor ; and the mere idea brought out a creeping shudder , as if a caterpillar were crawling slowly down his spine . Carrying his armful into the spare room at the end of the hall , he threw the clothes on the bare mattress of the bed , and went back to collect the toilet articles from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his toothbrush and powder and soap had been taken away with the razors . Damn him ! Asa burst out , while he picked up a box of used neckties and threw it on the pile of clothes in the spare room . As he soon learned , however , swearing could not do any harm . He could n't reach Peter . He could n't touch him . He could n't cause him so much as a single bad moment . In other years men had been killed for less than this , and a passionate regret surged up in him that the final authority of what his father had called " the Code " no longer survived , and that righteous killing had , long since , become as out of date as offended honor . Then , the next instant , that hidden imp of satire in his mind assured him Peter would have been the inevitable victor in any nature of combat , whether moral or physical . He had flung a discarded quilt over the mound on the bed , and was just shutting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall below , and Roy 's head emerged from the dim well of the staircase . " You stayed so long , Father , " she said in a resentful whisper . " What have you been doing ? " " The floor was soaked . I had to wipe it up . " Together they went into her small sitting-room and then into the bedroom adjoining . One object , he noticed , he had overlooked , a bag of tobacco from which Peter had recently filled his pipe . But , even while he hoped that she would not see it , she picked it up indifferently and tossed it into the waste-paper basket . " I wish you would stay downstairs tonight , Roy . In the morning we may have better news . " " Better news ? " He flinched from her mockery . " What news would be better ? "  | " I can make up my bed for you . . . or your mother 's day-bed in the sitting-room . " Her temper flared up . " Mother is driving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . She is your mother . " " That is n't my fault . I did n't ask her to bring me here . " " But you 've always been fond of her . " " I 'm fond of her still , I suppose , but I ca n't stand her . I ca n't  --  ca n't  --  ca n't stand her . " He sighed and gave up the struggle . It was true , he repeatedto himself , she must save herself in her own way . " Take something to make you sleep , " he said , turning as he was about to go . " I 'll bring you one of your mother 's tablets . " " I do n't want anything . I do n't want to sleep . " " You will wear yourself out . " " I want to wear myself out . " " At least you 'll stay at home tomorrow . You wo n't go back to work in the morning . " " Why should I stay at home ? Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut into his nerves . " I 'm going out , as soon as the shops open , and buy a new hat . I 'm going to buy a red hat . " There was nothing to answer . There was nothing to do or even to think . Without a word , he went over to the bed and turned down the coverlet . After he had smoothed the sheets and shaken the crushed pillows , he took up her blue thermos bottle and started again to leave the room . " I 'll bring this back a little later , " he said in a tone he tried to make unemotional , " and I 'll leave a tablet on your bed-table . You may need it in the night . " She did not answer , and as he turned away , he felt his pity struggling , like a breathless thing , in his throat . Hadp156he ever , even in his thwarted youth , suffered this agony ? Did every man live over his own mortal pain intensified in his children ? Lavinia was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , while he listened to her shallow moaning , he could not tell whether she was awake or asleep . Bending nearer , after an instant , he saw her features , exposed and unguarded , as if sleep had washed away her last frail protectionagainst the nature of facts . Her face appeared puffed and discolored and oddly foreshortened . What had he ever seen in her ? he found himself thinking . When he looked back on it now , the whole of his life and marriage seemed merely ridiculous . A man would n't stand for it nowadays , not in this irresponsible age . A whiff of mustard floated up from the bed , and it seemed to him that he breathed in the very odor of melancholy . Unbidden , a motiveless idea flitted into his mind and then out again before he had grasped it . She ca n't live forever. , Some time . . . some day . . . The thought was cut in two with a stroke , or rather , there was no beginning and no end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavinia stirred and put out a clutching hand . " Are you here , Asa ? " " Yes , I 'm here . Try to go back to sleep . " " I ca n't stop thinking . I ca n't stop thinking of Stanley . I keep wondering where she is and what she is doing . " " I know , but it does n't do any good . You 'll only make yourself ill again . " Though he spoke soothingly , his mind was swept by what he felt to be some external delirium in events . His inner recoil seemed to be merely a wave set in motion by some agitation without . " Whoever suffers from this affair , " he added , " it is n't going to be Stanley . "  |p157Lavinia  was crying softly . " I shall always feel that she is my baby . I can still feel her in my arms . " Leaving the bedside , Asa crossed the room to the window and flung up the sash . The storm was over , but the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the city , the country scents of wet grass and earth were blown into the room , into the house , into his aching mind . As he leaned out of the window , he seemed to drink in waves of the fresh darkness . Down below , he could see a luminous patch where the light gathered on the dripping boughs of a maple . It is no good bothering about what cannotbe helped , he thought . Even if I 'd had a chance , I might never have done any better . A man who knew how to get on would have made something , he supposed , out of nothing . A man who had confidence in himself might have governed his children . But he was n't so sure about that . He had seen too many successful persons come to grief through their children . Perhaps Roy , with her flippant gallantry , was right . Every human being , parent or child , must save himself by his own strength if he is to be saved . . . . Or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being can not stand alone , and that humanity must rise or sink , not in parts , but as a whole ? Craig had believed that the chief end of life was , not man , but humanity . Yet Craig had loved Stanley ; and that lonely passion had destroyed him . No , Asa told himself , man is not a rational animal . He may have invented many social philosophies , but he remains incurably biological.  | THE worst of all , Roy thought , was when she had turned a corner , thinking of nothing in particular , and had seen the man with broad shoulders and light hair leap down from a small car at the curb . Like a miracle , it had seemed to her , that one moment . Some secret pain in her heart gave a last shuddering beat , and was over , was ended . It was n't true , what had happened . The brisk air was brimming with surprise , and with delight , and with a startled sense of renewal . He had never gone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . He glanced up from the engine of his car , and casually looked at her with the eyes of a stranger . Yes , that had been the worst of all , except the constant dreaming and the waking  --  except the muffled slowness of time . Now in August she could look back , over a leaden unruffled stream of hours , toward those blank days in April . He had gone in April ; and since then , there had been no word but a message of unashamed happiness from Stanley to her mother . Nothing more . Nothing ever again as long as Roy lived . . . . But all that was over . Her life was her own , and she would not let it be spoiled . For there was no fairness in love . There was no fairness in having one 's whole heaven and earth overturned because one man , among all the millions of men in the world , had ceased to care , had found her wantingin whatever he needed for happiness . But wanting in what ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of herself , and yet find that all of herself , to the last heartbeat , was not enough ? In the beginning , she had probed the wound deeper and deeper . Alone in the night , she had driven her burning pride , her rage of thwarted longing , far down intop159the very depths of her agony . But only when she was alone in the night . Through the intolerable days , she had relentlesslygoverned her thoughts . Down to the shop in the morning , back again to the house and her mother in the late afternoon . Decorating places for other people to live in : furniture , wall-paper ; chintz , carpets , and curtains . Once the work had interested or amused her ; now she might as well have been playing with cinders . Yet nothing had really happened , she said to herself over and over . You could n't lose anything that had never belonged to you . And , after all , she knew how to live the kind of life that she wanted . No man , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . Round and round , wearing a red hat which cast a shadow over her haunted eyes , she went bravely through the interminabledays , weeks , months . No matter what it cost her , she would tear out the pain and trample it underfoot . She would rise above it by her own will , she told herself grimly . In those first months , she missed his physical presence as a man misses a wounded arm that has been cut away . She missed him waking and sleeping ; she missed him when she went out and , most of all , when she came in again . Even after he had ceased to live in her heart as a lover , he still lived on as a constant enemy in her nerves . It was as if passionhad deserted her conscious mind and taken root in the vital center of instinct . I have forgotten , she would say , and the thought would turn to a clutch of fear in her breast . For memory , like a vulture , was waiting to swoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark wings sweeping up from the depths below , and tracking her down through the labyrinth of her dreams , hanging poised , and watchful , not ever very far away , not even after she had escaped through the hidden door , where neither thought nor fear could follow her and survive . All day she could keep the door closed against memories ; all day she could defend her mind against the treachery that was hope . But , alone in the night , after she had resisted sleep as an enemy , she would drop back into the tormented world of her dreams . Living fragments of the past pursued her with the vividness , not of nightmare but of insane realities . For in her sleep she was al ' vays with Peter ; and the beginning of her dream was an amazed sense of peace , harmony , fulfilment , perfection . Then , at its highest point , the dream was suddenly shattered , and broken fragmentswould whirl , in a delirium of pain , through her consciousness . Why was it always like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mad act of delusion ? A hollow curve ? Nothingor everything ? She did not know because , just as clearnessapproached , the vision melted and vanished . From her dream , as it broke and dissolved , she would awake in terror and sink back into the ebbing moment of time ; and always , night after night , the slow waking was torture . While she was still asleep , the memory of pain , like a charged wire , would begin to vibrate in her nerves , quivering first in her elbows and knees , and then up through he limbs toward her resisting mind . The throbbing fear , the insistent message of grief , was as sharp as the backward rush of blood into a throat that has been hanged . What is it ? she would ask herself , in the uneasy pause between sleeping and waking . Something has hurt me . I can not remember what it was . Then gradually the cloud would lift , and the hammering beats of her heart would bring the recollection to life . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , day after day , she would awake sobbing because she had notp161forgotten , because she was beginning a new tomorrow , with all the cruelty of life still undefeated . While the day broke , she would lie weeping . Not until the sun had risen , and she heard a noise in the house below , could she struggle to her feet and start again her early morning battle with despair and remembrance . And all the while ( slipping into her bath , drying herself quickly , brushing her hair , and selecting a summer frock from the closet ) , the woman people called Roy Kingsmill would weave an unuttered conflict of words : " I have forgotten . " " Not in sleep , never in sleep . " " In the day I do not think of hin , . ' " But you dream of him . Your dreams bring him back again . " " When light comes , I can put him out of my mind . " " Not always , not everywhere . " " Always and everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see glimpses of him in he people you pass . " " But they go on ; they pass by . " " They pass by . Your hunger for him does not . It stays and remembers . " " There has been so short a time , only a few months . " " Time is always long , except to the happy . " " I shall be happy again . I shall be happy and free . " " You still hope . There is no freedom in hoping for what never comes . " " Love is not everything . " " Love is all that you want . " " But I will not be defeated . . . " Every morning it was like this , an endless sequence , an unbroken weaving of thought and of impulse , of will and of emotion . While she dressed to go out , she would move in response to this continuing unspoken rhythm . Then , at last , as she shut the door behind her , she would shut in the other half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she descended the stairs . Let me forget until night . If only her father had cared less . If only she could be spared the intolerable pity in those secretive and amused eyes , which nowadays were no longer amused when they looked at her . She did not want pity . She wanted sternness , inflexibility , even that lost sardonic humor . What she needed most , she knew , was to be told , and told , and to be convinced also , that in the midst of a world toppling over in ruins , desire for a single human being had become not merely unimportantbut wasteful . Once , Craig might have told her this . He might even believe it again , she thought , and began wondering about Craig . Was he also fighting to save himself from hatred and bitterness ? Or had he already given up and gone under ? It would be easier to talk with him than with her father , whose wordless sympathy seemed to be draining the little strength she had left . Even ridicule would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed the right way , would demand nothing , not even acknowledgment . A core of flint , she thought ; I want a heart , not of flesh and blood , but of flint . And then : I am hurting Father , I know , but this also I can not help . Only by being cruel myselfam I able to escape from cruelty . For the first time , she perceived dimly the reason underlying her mother 's maladjustmentto life . It was necessary , she saw , to enter into the nature of pain , which was cruelty , before she could overcomeand destroy it . The one thing that could help her would be to banish the thought of love , to stifle forever the quiver/ing nerve of her memory , and to persuade her aching flesh that she had lost nothing through losing a love which was in itself but less than nothing . When her father made early coffee , he would bring Roy a cup ; and her whole body would seem to awake , and then turn to stone , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring "  --  did he mean crying ?  --  " and I 've brought you your coffee . " " You did n't make it just for me ? " " I made it for your mother and myself . She always wants her coffee the first thing . " " I could n't drink it if I knew you 'd got up so early and made it just for me . " " Bless your heart , darling . " His tone sounded too sprightly . " I should n't have thought of that . " " Did Mother talk all night ? " " Not after midnight . She quieted down when she 'd taken her veronal and hot milk . " " I wonder how you stand it . " A gleam of laughter would flicker again in his smile . How tired he looked , in his faded blue and white cotton pajamas , under a drab-colored bathrobe . He looked old and patient for his years , and yet , in some queer way , indestructible . Seeing him like that , stripped alike of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had she found time to worry over anything outside herself , whether he did not possess some deep instinct for survival which had been left out of his children . " Well , I 'm getting on , you know , " he would answer . " As a man gets older , I suppose he becomes more or less of a pachyderm . " " I wish you did n't look so  --  so terribly patient . " 164 IN THIS OUR LIFE " Patient ? Good Lord , you do n't know me ! If I had a chance , I 'd smash up the whole business . But would n't you like to stay in bed this morning ? I 'll bring up your break-fast . " " No , I 'd rather get up . Is it time yet ? " " It 's not yet six . I knew you were n't asleep . " " No , I was n't asleep . These early hours drag so slowly . " " Did n't you sleep at all ? " " Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise herself in bed , sipping the fragrant coffee . " You do make the best coffee . And a little cream does help , does n't it ? " But she was only playing for time , she thought wearily : I ca n't talk to him . I have n't anything to say , about anything . Then this would give her an idea , and she would murmur between sips of coffee , " I do wish Mother would try to stop talking . " " To wish that does not do any harm . " His eyes would smile between crinkled eyelids . " But she never will . " This would make him chuckle under his breath , as if , with his queer streak of humor , he found it amusing . " She is mortal . So I should n't say never . " " It 's like  --  it 's like a disease . " " A compulsive neurosis , so young Buchanan calls it . He thinks it may get better in time . " " What does that young man know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe . Do n't all you young ones know more than your elders ? Anyway , he came yesterday , and your mother approves of him . " " Oh , I know . She told me about him , but I was n't listening . I never listen when I can help it . " " That 's right . It 's the only way . But your mother is no/body 's fool , my dear . She has a fund of hard common sense . " " You need n't say it . I know . " Then he would take her empty cup , while that intolerable misery twisted and turned and struggled in the vacancy of her mind . If only he would goway ! If only she could live among indifferent and un-p yang strangers ! " I 'll see you at breakfast , daughter . " " Yes , I 'll be down to breakfast . " " It 's still early . Turn over and try to take another nap . " " I 'll try . " Oh , Daddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? You are my father ; but what do I know of you ? Do I really know you any better than I thought I knew Peter ? She and Peter had loved each other ; they had imaginedthat love would outlast life ; they had believed that marriagewould bring happiness . How had that belief ended ? Peter , whom she had loved , was no more to her , now , than any other traveller she might meet and pass on an unfamiliarroad . He was as unreal as the fleeting resemblances that mocked at her from strange faces , from frail gestures or outlines , which fled , always a little farther away , and which eluded her at the next corner . After her father had gone , and the sound of his footsteps had stopped in her mother 's room , she would lie listening to the rattle of milk wagons returning , and the steady clop-clop of Bill , the old chestnut horse . One pigeon and then another , and presently a disordered flock of light and dark wings , would sail slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could watch the mountingflight toward the sky , and then the fluttering indecision of the birds ' descent to the ground . Sometimes , she knew , they would wait in dignified rows along the back fence until her father had thrown out cracked corn from the kitchen doorway . Father is good , she thought , without emotion or interest , but what has goodness ever done for him ? Has he ever really had anything that he wanted ? Closing her eyes to the tender green on the trees and the sky beyond , she would sink back into a stillness of the mind which was not so much sleep as a suspension of all thinking and feeling . Thought and sound would mingle and approach , would recede into emptiness . She had forgotten . All or nothing was , for the moment , over and done with . Then , after a long silence , while she lay there , with closed eyes and ears , she would feel again the muted discord within , the old familiarvibration . " What had I left undone ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The why began before you were born . After that , nothingmatters that was ever done or left undone . " " Was there some fault in myself ? When I gave everything , why was it never enough ? " " Everything , when it is poured out , is never enough . " " But I will not be defeated . . . " Even her mother 's selfishness ( if only her mother could keep quiet ) was not so harassing as the unspoken sympathy of her father . For it was possible to shut her ears to her mother , and to treat her lamentations over Stanley as if they were a hymn or a prayer in church . But , in some deeper part of herself , Roy was always aware of her father . She could not simply plunge down into her inner misery , and pretend him away . His pity might hurt her , it might exasperateher ; but it never left her indifferent . There was a nerve of sympathy between them , a mental or emotional connection , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because I feel sorry for him that he hurts me , shep167thought . He loves me too much , and it is all wasted . I do n't want anybody to love me too much . The tension was less with her mother , because the tie between them was superficial . Stanley had always been the favorite , and as a child , Roy had been aware of a ruffled and uneasy strain in her mother 's maternal affection  --  or instinct . Was it jealousy in herself ? Roy had wondered . Was it envy ? Was it the simple recoil of her earliest emotion towardlife ? Not until her childhood was over had she discovered in herself a deep-rooted antipathy to her mother 's habit of mind . " Try not to be so hard , Roy , " Lavinia would plead vainly . " But I like hardness , Mother . I like almost anything better than sloppiness . Most of our trouble in the South comes from sloppiness . Sloppy thinking , sloppy feeling , and sloppy workmanship . " Moaning tearlessly , Lavinia would stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become an embodiment of that realistic point of view against which Lavinia had fought as far back as she could remember . Even now , that stern principle , rising in a tide over the modern world , was nibbling at the sands of her evasive idealism . Always , she told herself , she had been driven from one stronghold of faith to another . Sentiment had failed her ; chivalry had failed her ; feminine weakness and sex compulsion had alike failed her ; and it now appeared that her last lonely refuge , of hypochondria , was about to be undermined . " I 've done the best I could , Roy . " " Oh , Mother , for God 's sake . . . " " I feel for you until it almost breaks my heart . " " I do n't want you to feel for me . All I want you to do is to stop talking . "  | " You were always hard even when you were little . " Roy laughed . " And I 'm going to be still harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my favorite because she is beautiful . But it was n't that . She was so soft , that 's why I petted her . " " Ca n't you stop thinking about her ? " " Stop thinking ! Why , I do n't know where she is or who is looking after her . Her clothes are still packed away upstairs , and I do n't know where to send them . " " She 'll let you know quick enough when she wants them . And somebody is looking after her . You may count upon that . " " I ca n't stop loving her just because she 's weak  --  or  --  or even bad , " Lavinia sobbed . " After all , she is my baby . " But Stanley was more than a baby , Roy thought ; she was a fantasy clothed in flesh and made living . For Lavinia , who had craved charm and beauty , had been endowed with no one of the qualities that appeal either to the vague beneficenceof chivalry or to the sharp greed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so many weary years , she appeared , not feminine and languishing , but merely massive and irremovable . As a chronic invalid , she seemed to diffuse less the delicacy of sentiment than the flabbiness of decay . Poor Mother ! Roy would say to herself , if only pretenses could last ! When Maggie came in , the stale air would freshen , and the tone of living would become less dramatic and more natural . For Maggie was a practical soul , who , since she had worked for her living , had seen chivalry plucked of its more brilliant feathers . In the beginning , Lavinia had opposedAndrew 's marriage ; but her opposition had meltedp169away as soon as she had made the agreeable discovery that Maggie was the only member of the family who enjoyedher conversation , and who accepted her moth-eaten interior grandeur seriously . Maggie made few demands on intelligence ; and had learned , long ago , that her wishes would be noticed almost as infrequently as they would be gratified . She had sprung from an obscure family , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diligent climber . With the ingenuous eagerness of a simple mind , Maggie , who was lively , energetic and " a good manager " on a small income , would ecstatically wander about , for hours , in Lavinia 's own special dreary province of shadows within shadows . For all her healthy zest , Roy wondered , was Maggie animatedby a perpetual craving denied ? Was her flight into delusion merely an escape from Andrew and the ordinary ? her marriage was highly successful . She and Andrew were a devoted couple , and they were inordinately proud of their three commonplace children . Maggie 's nursery , like her house , was well-ordered , and Andrew 's pockets were permanentlybulging with infant scribblings . One , perhaps two , of the children , he was convinced , were budding poets , though he never read poetry , or maybe novelists , though he never read novels . Did it simply mean , Roy asked herself , that human companionship , even at its best , is never enough ? After all else had been given , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O F U N R E A S O N THE omnibus swayed , creaked , bumped over a rock , and lumbered on toward the next service station . I hope nobody else will get in , Asa said to himself , glancing round at the empty seats . In twenty minutes more , I ought to come to the cross-roads . Kate would meet him there in her muddy Ford , as she did every Sunday when he was not kept at home by Lavinia or by the absence of Selina , the colored maid , who came on Virgie 's afternoons off . For twenty years and more , these Sabbath flights into the country and freedom had been the solitary pleasure , apart from Roy 's infrequent companionship , in a life which , from its beginning , had been starved for delight . At first , he had gone to see jack Oliver , his only intimate friend ; but since Jack died , Kate had gradually taken her husband 's place in Asa 's affection . Kate was the one human being with whom his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open sky . His feeling for her was friendship , he knew , but it was friendship exalted to a major emotion . Whenever he thought of her , it was not as a possible lover but as a great companion . He had always , in the ancient language of chivalry , " respected " her , While Jack lived , he had continued to adore him as passionatelyas a smaller boy adores an older champion . In the last year , however , Asa had understood that he wanted more from Kate than these few Sunday afternoons at Hunter'sFare . What he wanted was to spend his life with her and with the things they both loved  --  the fields and woods and streams and all the friendly animals on the farm . Sitting there , among vacant seats , he played with his desire , as a man toys with a bright , improbable dream . Some day , in a near or distant future , before old age had smothered him in ashes , Lavinia would cease to need his services , as she had long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as rich , and no matter how desperatelyhe clung to his possessions , in the end he must leave them . Since he gave to charity with an even stronger reluctancethan he gave to his relatives , it was natural to assume that a proper share of his fortune would pass on to Lavinia . And when Lavinia was wealthy enough to afford more competent nursing than a husband provided , Asa told himself , with a leaping heart , he should be discharged from his task . She would be glad to get rid of me , he thought , without resentment , if she were able to put a trained nurse , or even two of them , in my place . With the coming of that day , if it ever came , Lavinia would set him free to spend his westering years with Kate on the farm by the river . Let people say what they chose . From the chains of public opinion , he told himself thankfully , he was already released . The road was swathed in October dust , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanwise , within a dark border of woods . From the burning brushwood , blue wings of smoke soared up to melt into the deeper blue of the sky . On the farm , he knew , there would be the bitter-sweet tang of woodsmoke and crushed apples mingled with the wilder scents of earth mould and ripened grass and sunshine on life-ever-lasting . . . . I 've a whole afternoon , he thought . I must taste every drop of it . A flock of crows , bronzed by sunlight , flapped and dipped and floated slowly over an old cornfield . His gaze followed them dreamily . Light and darkness . . . a singing wind . . . an escape from the present . For , in spitep175of his effort , he could not harness his mind to the moment before him . He could not break away from the past ; he could not ally himself with the future . Something , he admittedreluctantly , was dragging him back . Even if he were free to choose ( and Andrew said that divorces were as easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if he could ever bring himself to stand up to circumstances . He still belonged to his children , though two of them , and these two the most gifted , had made , it seemed to him , a frightful havoc of their own lives . . .. The crows mounted in orderly ranks , flapped in a wide circle over the cornfield , and then swooped down to research among the stubble . And over all  --  over the band of woods , the bronze-colored shocks of corn , the gauzy meadows , the rising and falling crows , the swaths of October dust in the road  --  there was something else , something vague , shimmering , fire-tinted , a mist and yet not wholly a mist , advancing and retreating , and , as it retreated , calling to that lost hunter in the heart . It was the spirit of autumn . But the call is n't true , he told , himself . It is only the false echo of a summer that is ended . And freedom ? Was freedom also nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seemed to start and move and fly away as he rushed on , he was enveloped in the many humiliations and little miseries of the past six months . Watching Roy 's drawn features , as she grew paler and thinner under her smiling mockery , he had felt that , day by day , the distance between them widened . She had steadilyrebuffed him ; she had denied him her confidence ; she had met every approach with an instant withdrawal . " I must help myself in my own way , " she had repeated . " I can do without sympathy . " On the morning after that terriblenight , he remembered , she had gone to work as usual ,  | and had patiently and desperately matched wall-paper and chintz . At lunch , she was wearing a new red hat , with a becoming slant over her dark eyebrows ; and he noticed , at the first glance , that the color of her lips was deeper and the gloss on her hair more lustrous . Yet , hour by hour , or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artificial brightness , and the air of gallant youth had diminished . Well , it was the modern way , Asa told himself , and certainly it was an advance upon the classic manner of the deserted woman . Whether or not it invited sympathy , one could scarcely fail to respect a defeat that had been turned into victory . Yet when William , persuaded into generosity by Charlotte , had offered to send Roy to Europe , she had tossed back airily : " I do n't need a change , thank you . I 'm all right as I am . Peter and I understand each other , and he has n't treated me badly . " William , he uneasily recalled , had scowled with anger . " If she 's going to stand up for that  --  that scoundrel , " he fumed , " I 'll wash my hands of the lot of you . " Yes , that was a mistake , Asa told himself . On her mother 's account , it was a mistake to repulse William . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked on the way home . " Your Uncle William means well , and he can do so much for you . " " But I do n't want him to do anything for me , " she had retorted almost fiercely . " I do n't want anybody to do anything in the world . " " It would n't hurt you to go abroad . It might even help . " She had laughed bitterly . " Not unless I could go where there is fighting . " Then she had stared at him . " I 'm going to stay here and stand my ground , no matter what happens . And I 'm not going to let people pity me or abuse Peter . " That was magnanimous , no doubt , Asa reflected now ;  |p177but  it was imprudent . Peter had been faithless ; he had been cruel and selfish , not only to her and to Stanley , but to others who had trusted and believed in him . Asa could find no inclination to defend Peter ; and he knew that in estranging William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roy was not only forfeiting material benefits in the future , but was putting herself in the wrong with her family and her friends . It was not agreeable , even for a dotingfather , as Lavinia called him , to have one 's sympathy thrust back and disclaimed . Loving her as he did , he might pretend not to feel hurt ; but William had shown plainly that he was affronted . William had always preferred Stanleybecause her nature was soft , not firm , at the core , and because , too , she was as innocent of moral judgment as she was untroubled by convictions . But I loved her , too , Asa thought , for these same reasons . Even when I saw through her shallowness , I was still susceptible to its charm . Well , but love is a queer thing at best , and it seldom thrives , apparently , upon the highest part of us . We love from little motives , not for large reasons ; and yet , motives no bigger than mice may dart into a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief or honor or even world revolution . It was characteristic , of course , that William 's tougher fiber should respond to the attraction of weakness . That was now , and would always be , Asa supposed , the primaryinstinct of man  --  or was it merely the instinct of sex ? Not that it mattered . He could n't help Roy by thinking . He might worry all day with the thought , as a dog with a marrow-bone , but it would still be there after he was worn out by his worrying . But Roy ? What was she thinking in that withdrawn mind of hers ? Why was she holding off sympathy , thrusting backp178tenderness ? " I must save myself alone . " That was all . And perhaps that was everything . Perhaps she was really saving herself from future disaster . He brooded over the possibilitybut the memory of her stricken eyes , when she imaginedherself unobserved , tortured his mind . Yet even that look of natural anguish , he found easier to bear than her false gaiety  --  her laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home now , unless Lavinia summoned her to witness a heart attack or a recurring death-bed scene . " False angina , " Buchanan had called Lavinia 's spasms , but , watching her while she struggled for breath , Asa had doubted the medical judgment . The pain at least was true , and pain , he had learned long ago , was the sharpest reality . For a few hours , while her mother demanded her presence , Roy would sit by her bedside . Then , as soon as the worst was over , and Asa or Selina or Virgie had suppliedthe necessary remedies , she would spring up in nervoushaste , and rush out of the room and the house  --  anywhere , day or night . Her work was going well ; for Roy had never let herself shirk , he reflected , with pride . As an interior decorator , she was beginning to be sought after in Queenborough , and her salary , as manager of the shop , had been increased in September . For a while , after Craig , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had appeared to think of nothing but work . Day after day , she would linger on at the shop , and then come home with her arms filled with samples to be studied and matched or contrasted at home . Then she had flashed about , in a new excitement , to dances and screen pictures ; but this stage had passed quickly . It was noticeable that since August she had turned to Craig , whom she had met somewhere by accident , as one turns for comfort to the only person whop179understands and has endured a similar agony . Because he had suffered under the same cruelty , he must have learned how to bear it  --  or at least how to dull the severest pang of the torture . In the beginning , she had seen Craig only at long intervals ; but within the last month or two they had been often together , and Craig had dropped into the habit of calling at the shop and driving her home in the afternoon . They were not unsuited to each other , Asa mused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible that , given time and opportunity , they might grow together in sympathy . Both were over-sensitive , and both were inclined to take life and love too dangerously for happiness . In these ways they were so much alike that they might have been designed for each other . He wondered if fate , with an over-pointed cynicism , had yet again staged one of its many ironic tragedies , when it entangled their destinies with the helpless and frail passion of Peter and Stanley ? Asa had never doubted that this vehement passion was fugitive , or that it would , in the end , burn away in its own fire . Even so , before the next turn of events , what could Roy and Craig save from destruction ? In the past month they had seemed to enjoy a new comradeship with each other , and Asa had watched hopefully while Craig 's look of sultry anger grew less oppressive . Sometimes , when they were alone downstairs or just coming in from the street , he would hear them laughing together , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and natural . A few days ago , he might have told himself that with complete confidence . But only last night , on his way downstairs at three o'clock to heat a cup of milk for Lavinia , who could not sleep , he had glanced upstairs , and had seen a thin crack of light under Roy 's door . Stealing softly up to the third storey , he had caught the sound of smothered sobbing ; and , for several minutes , he had hesitated , with his hand outstretched to the door-knob . Dividing them , there was only that crack of light ; yet when at last he had turned away , the hall had appeared bottomless , like a well of uneasy darkness . He knew that she would reject both his love and his pity . She would resent any intrusion into the private world of her sorrow . I 'd give my right arm to help her , he had thought . I 'd give my right arm if I could take all her burden on my own shoulders . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swerved on a sudden to avoid a file of geese perking down the roadway . In a few minutes , Asa would see the old Ford , with Kate in the front seat , and Pat and Percy , the two pointers , waiting , alert and expectant , beside the car . With this picture in his mind , he told himself that , but for these rare interludes , he could never have borne the thirty years of his marriage . They meant a release , not only from the atmosphere of invalidism , but also from that subjection to material values which , to an accepted failure in life , was still more repugnant . A change , for even a few hours , had been to him like an anodyne in an incurable malady . When the afternoon was over , and not until then , he would return to the familiar hated drudgery of the stemming-room , as well as to the sickening fear that this drudgery , which he hated , might soon be denied him . To be thrown on the contemptuouscharity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any drudgery , either with or without the security that might keep Asa alive yet a while longer . The omnibus had swerved again ; and the sharp turn threw him out of his seat . There was a white mule amblingp181leisurely across the road toward a distant and more desirablepasture . Straight ahead , he could recognize the big oak , with a bluish tinge in the veins of its wine-colored leaves . For two hundred and fifty years that oak had been rooted in the square at the cross-roads ; yet Kate told him it was now threatened by the political axe of the highway department . Her casual tolerance of everything and everybody ( since God must shoulder at least a share of responsibility ) had yielded to a rare flash of moral resentment . " Politicians ! " she exclaimed angrily . " Politicians would murder an ancestor to pay for a vote ! " There she was , very erect , in her mud-caked car , wearing the old brown woolen suit , with the ugly felt hat slanting forward over her honest bright brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward her , he felt that the whole world was transfigured by the flushed air of October . She was not beautiful ; she was not even pretty ( though , at fifty , she carried her years lightly ) , but she was the one thing , in a disappointing life , that he wanted unchanged . Her warm smile , as genial as autumn , flooded his heart . By a miracle , he felt , the sense of defeat , and his timid acquiescencein William 's and the world 's judgment , had vanished . While he held her large , warm hand , which was burned as brown as the soil , he was shot through by an excitement which was not the thrill of joy alone , but a feeling of sanity , of rightness , and of a spirit replenished . The pointers were on him now , overpowering him with their unrestrained welcome . Then , as he took the seat at Kate 's side , Pat and Percy scrambled into the back of the car , and immediately he was aware of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect day , " she said . " I 'm so glad . "  | " Yes , that 's fine . I was afraid it would rain . " The car turned into the straight sandy road , and they drove on in silence , because the time for speech had not come . Their meetings were always like this , and the first few miles gave him the rest and the change of heart that he needed . Even the pointers had stopped nuzzling . He knew that behind him they had poised themselves on their haunches . He knew also it had been good to see them again . He could never be happy without the companionship of one or more dogs , but he supposed Lavinia was within her rights when she forbade them the house . And no civilized dog would consent to develop a kennel personality . The sandy road sank down into a narrow stream and ran on again , in a long , slow stretch , through the powdery bloom of the meadows . There was a faint humming in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if invisible wings flashed and turned in the sunshine . Closing his eyes , he drew in a languid breath of the life-ever-lasting , so vague , yet so haunting . Then , raising his eyelids , he gazed over the October landscape , into the veiled distance of the horizon . Light was everywhere , without and within , and he felt that the flash of wings turning was merely a projection of happiness . For this was happiness . . . He looked at Kate and , with her eyes on the road , she smiled in complete understanding . " Are you rested ? " she asked , and her voice was a murmur . " I 'm always rested down here . Being with you rests me . " " With me and the dogs . " " That 's right . With you and Pat and Percy and things that grow in the fields . The best tonic I know is the smell of the earth . "  | " You 've had a hard week . " " Every week is hard , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You need a change . I ca n't remember that you ever had a vacation . " " I 've had these Sunday afternoons . The trouble is that I 'm getting on . You ca n't argue with time . " She glanced at his downcast face . " I wish you could come more often . This is the first Sunday in three weeks . " " It seems longer than that . All the time it gets less easy to break away . Roy goes off for week-ends . I do n't like to leave Lavinia alone . " " Has she been worse ? " " I do n't know . The doctor says not . " " Does she talk about Stanley ? " " Every hour of the day . She just lies there and worries about her . " " Does she ever hear from her ? " " Once in a long while . There was that letter I told you about , when they were so happy together . One has come since I saw you . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " " And you ? " " Well , I was n't quite sure . Maybe I was thinking too much about Roy . " What was it , he asked himself , that had made him wonder , at the time , whether Stanley 's letter was as natural as Lavinia imagined ? He had never told Lavinia , and he hesitated even now before telling his suspicion to Kate . How much , in mere point of fact , had he ever told Kate ? To save his life , he could not remember . That meant that he was growing old ( though sixty seemed young enough to him , nowadays ) , but he supposed he was older than most men of his years . He noticed that he had begun to repeat himself ; his father used to say that repeating oneself was the first sign of senility . Yet he could remember quite clearly things that happened when he was a boy , and even when he was hardly more than a baby . His Aunt Mary Gracie , for instance . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet he had never forgotten her . He remembered distinctlythe time she opened a paper bag and gave him a stick , with a curved handle , of red and white peppermint candy . " I wonder . . . " he began aloud , and added , " I 'm growing more forgetful . " " You are n't old enough for that yet . You 're tired out , that 's all . What you need is a rest . " He raised his hand to brush away an imaginary cobweb . A real rest , he reflected , was something he 'd never had , not since his father died , anyway , and that was more than forty  --  it was nearer fifty years ago . " I 'm damned tired , " he said , " of being sorry for people . " At the worried tone in his voice Pat , the elder pointer , pushed a chill nose against the back of his neck . A lone turkey gobbler was strutting across the road , and the car slowed down until some twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Kate said presently . Her voice was crisp with vitality , and this crispness was bracing . " All my life , at least since Father died , " he burst out , " I 've had to be sorry for somebody . I never did anything I wanted to do , because always somebody was so much worse off than I was . I 'm fed up on pity now . I 've just about come to the end of being sorry for other people . . . " He laughed with his quizzical accent . " The truth is that myp185sympathy has gone flat . I ca n't even feel sorry for Roy , because losing a lover appears so unimportant beside losing a job . I saw a man lose a job yesterday , at sixty-nine , with nothing ahead but the poorhouse , and it seemed to me that losing all the lovers in the world would matter less . I suppose I was wondering whether my turn would come next . . . . " She threw him a cheerful smile . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she answered . " A farm always needs an extra man . " A sudden glow irradiated his features . " I 'm looking ahead to that . There may be a little happiness yet before  --  before I 'm too old to know what it feels like . . . " A chain dragged within ; but there was still happiness somewhere in the future  --  somewhere in the distance . . . " It may be only a notion , but it keeps me going , " he added aloud . " When I find myself getting too anxious about Roy , I begin to think that something has got to happen , sooner or later . " " I thought Roy was more happy . " " So did I , for a few weeks ; but it is n't easy to tell about Roy . Last night , when I went down to heat Lavinia 's milk , I heard her walking about and sobbing in her room . She had gone out with Craig to some lecture . I suppose she turned to him because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks as if she 'd taken up with his ideas , more or less . After all , I imagine a world revolution , or the hope of one , would be as good a solace for a broken heart as anybody could find . " Kate nodded . " Misery has made more revolutions than either philanthropy or economics . Anyway , I 'd be glad to see Roy interested . " " I thought she was interested in her work . She is get- ting orders all the time . In a few years she should be making a good income . But it looks as if that is n't enough . " He smiled , and his voice softened . " She 's a generous little thing . If I 'd let her , she 'd give all she makes to me or her mother . " " Could n't she help with a nurse for her mother ? " He shook his head . " I ca n't see her ground down to powder as I was . Besides , Selina is there now , whenever Virgie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get home . " " But it 's killing you . " " Good Lord , no . I 'm as tough as a pine knot . The trouble with me today is that I heard Roy crying last night . I ca n't put it out of my mind . I can never keep her out of my mind when she is unhappy . " Kate turned to smile at him , and a wave of energy rushed through her , as if she had summoned all her cheerfulness and her faith in life . " Roy is splendid , " she said emphatically . " I think she is finer than we used to be in our youth . I wonder , " she added slowly , " if we were ever a match for the generation of today at its best . " " Only it is , or seems to be , so seldom at its best , " he retorted . " But what I 'm afraid of is that Roy has become too hard , and even bitter in spots . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sympathize with her if she did n't feel bitterly . But give her time . " " She seems really to like being with Craig , but of course it may be merely a bluff . I do n't know what they can find to talk about ; but he brings her books , whether she reads them or not , and they go to meetings and to movies together . " He drew in his breath sharply , while he watched a buzzard sail slowly nearer before it shot down with outspreadwings to the earth . " I wonder what is wrong with the world nowadays . "  |p187Kate  laughed , and her gaiety , he thought , was like music . " The same old Adam , I suppose . Human nature . I do n't like human nature , but I do like human beings . " " It 's all so illogical . Why could n't Peter and Stanley , and Craig and Roy , have paired off in the beginning ? Why do all of us , every last one , have to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The car had jerked up before the red gate of the farm , and he got down to open it . While he held back the gate , she drove through , and the pointers bounded out , racing ahead up the white road bordered by cedars . Some years ago , the procession of cedars had led for nearly a mile ; now the older trees were either standing dead or else they had fallen and rotted . The few that were still left cast an elegiac gloom into the long avenue ; and around them , under the open sky , the wild autumn meadows swept away to the dark range of pines in the distance . " I ca n't afford to keep up the place , " Kate was saying , " but Jack and I always liked it as it is , trodden down by the years . The farm brings in very little , but it has given us something we could never buy . " They drove on , with the pointers racing ahead , until Kate drew up before the square white porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will you come in for a drink ? " she asked . " Or shall we have our walk ? " " Let 's have the walk first . I want to go down through the fields to the river edge . " " In a minute . I 'll tell Martha . " She went into the house ; and turning away , while Pat and Percy leaped and circled in front of him , he crossed the ragged lawn , beneath dappled shadows of elms , and stood waiting for Kate to come out . The river path , trailing across the meadows , was lost in billowing waves of asters , golden-rod , and life-ever-lasting.  | There was no wind , and the October sunshine , pouring down from the stainless blue of the sky , kindled the variegated bloom into a running flame , misted over with smoke-colored pollen . " It ca n't last , " he thought . " Time comes , time passes . " But what was time ? An element or an illusion ? Flow or duration ? And how deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today from tomorrow ? The scene was so breathless , so drowned in stillness , as if in a well of being , that it seemed to him his pulses had ceased their vibration . Not only time but life itself was suspended . Nothingmoved . Nothing passed . The drifting pollen , the bird on the wing , the flower on the weed , the ripened seed in the flower , the bronzed leaves on the elms , the shadows asleep on the grass  --  all these things were as motionless as is the pause between the flow and ebb of a tide , or the breath between the thought and the spoken word . . . Then , suddenly , movement stirred in the air above , and again the scene came to life . A straggling line of crows wavered in curves out of the sky , while below them , their shadows skimmed so close to the ground that the meadows appeared to move and breathe with them in slow pulsations of light . Yes , it had to change , he said aloud to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it may be better , " a voice murmured behind him , and there was Kate , bare-headed and smiling . " We 'll take that little path where the meadow-larks are flying up from the weeds . " The amused gleam flashed into his eyes , and he felt , without knowing why , years younger . If only he could be with Kate always , he thought ; and he wondered why nothing one really wanted ever came except in snatches , except by accident.  |p189They  went out from the shadow of the elms , and turned into the hidden path that led downwards . Pat and Percy wheeled and romped in the meadows , dusting the bloom from the life-ever-lasting and chasing the whirring wings of the larks . A drift of woodsmoke curled up from a pile of brush near the barn , and as they approached the old orchard the air was pungent with the smell of crushed apples . As he glanced at Kate and met her laughing eyes , a sense of comradeship , as deep and mellow as the autumn light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , he thought , suddenly , in surprise . This is happiness . . . .  |p190AS  Asa went up the steps and drew out his latchkey , a clock somewhere in the city struck tenslow strokes , which seemed to sink into the night and leave a pool of silence behind them . An instant later , when he entered the house , he felt that he had stepped back into emptiness . There was no one downstairs ; but the sound of voices from Lavinia 's room reminded him that Charlotte had promised to sit with her until he came in . I hope I have n't kept her too long , he thought , and then defiantly : I have a right to an afternoon off once in a while . The few hours of happiness had altered his mood , and he felt that his energies were braced for resistance . " Here is Asa now , " Lavinia remarked , a trifle querulously , as he entered . " He looks as if he had had a good time in the country . " Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm conviction that , whatever her husband 's failings might be as a breadwinner , he had been born , as she said , " without that other side to his nature , " and partly because she felt that Kate also was lacking in what Lavinia regarded as the wrong kind of appeal . In the softest of the winged chairs , Mrs. Fitzroy was enthroned , like some immense seated idol of benevolence . The reflective twinkle in her eyes had always endeared her to Asa , and he wondered now , clasping the plump cushion of her hand , how she had endured her half-century of marriage to William 's curiously perverted sense of humor . Yet , after a glance at her placid features , one might imagine that she had thrived under browbeating and had been agreeablypuffed up by inhibitions.  | " I 'm glad you 've had your day off , Asa , " she said in a voice which was singularly sweet and low . " I hope you enjoyedit . " " Enjoyed it ? " He looked round him , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , I enjoyed it . I mean . . . " he began , and broke off because he did not know what he had started to say . Some wave of impulse , which had swept out of darkness and flooded his mind with sound and light , had already subsided . Words were only syllables strung together , he thought ; they have been used so often that they are as dry and empty as old wasps ' nests . What he treasured in his memory was a single burning ray of experience , the knowledge that , for a little while , he had lived , not according to a rule of custom , but in obedience to some involuntary and unconscious upheaval of pure instinct . Yes , I was happy , he mused , with that sense of surprise , which continued to repeat itself as a recurring phrase . I have been happier than I thought I could ever be . But why ? He had had only the fields and the white roads leading somewhere  --  nowhere  --  and this comradeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more satisfying than ecstasy . " Uncle William has had a letter , " Lavinia said . " A letter ? " " From Stanley . It came yesterday . " " What did she want ? " " She wants him to send her car on to Baltimore . Peter is in the hospital all day , and she is bored and unhappy with nothing to do . " Asa stared at his wife blankly . " Did she say that ? " Lavinia glanced toward Charlotte , who nodded emphatically . " Oh , more than that . It seems that Peter is working very hard . He has a position in a hospital . They say that he has a really brilliant technique . . . . " Asa smiled . " I 've heard that before . Did n't Craig say his skill was a matter of touch and go ? " " Yes , I remember . " Charlotte beamed . " Poor Lavinia would suffer so much less if she could see that everything has its humorous side . " " Even running away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I can not find that amusing . " " Not that , but the way Stanley seems to have lost sight of the  --  of the tragedy . I hope , " Charlotte added , lowering her voice , " that Roy has forgotten as quickly . " " Where is she ? " Asa asked . " I mean Roy . " " She went out with Craig . There was a Sunday meeting somewhere about something  --  but it was n't religious . Only it must have been unpleasant , or they would n't have gone . Only horrors are able to arrest their attention . " " Well , if horrors divert them , " Asa rejoined in a tolerant tone , " why worry ? And if nothing else can be said in favor of evil , at least it does provide the one inexhaustible topic . " " Yes , I know , " Lavinia assented wearily . " Anything is better than brooding  --  especially for Roy . " " What does William say ? " Asa sat down in front of Charlotteas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending the car . " He has n't said anything yet , but you know how William is about Stanley . " " Nobody could have been more generous , " Lavinia insisted . Charlotte grasped the wings of her chair with hands which were astonishingly strong in spite of their softness . On the third finger of her left hand , guarding her heavy gold wed/ding-ring of more than fifty years ago , she wore a magnificentemerald set in a thin band of platinum . " Well , you know how old men are about young girls , " she replied amiably ; " and I will say for Stanley that she has always been very nice to him . He is out of patience with her now , but when she tries , she can twist him round her little finger . " Charlotte looked as soft as a feather-bed , and just as expressionless , Asa thought , gazing up at her from a lower seat . She was fat and dumpy and utterly without style of form or feature ; but she had dignity ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her mild fortitude , she will outlastWilliam , Asa prophesied mutely . He may hector her , but her unruffled softness will wear him down in the end . " If she wants the car , I 'd like her to have it , " Asa said . " It may keep her out of mischief . " " Yes , she ca n't have many friends , " Charlotte assented . " She 's not the kind to make friends with other girls , and yet she never liked to be left by herself . It 's a pity that she ca n't get to know people , " she continued after a minute . " We have several very good friends in Baltimore , but  --  oh , well , one never knows . . . . " " I ca n't imagine what she does with herself all day . " Lavinia'stears had become a matter of habit , and nobody noticedthem . " She ca n't have money for shopping . But after all we went through , it is settled now . They are married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of their lives somewhere . I suppose we ca n't expect Peter not to go on with his career . Only I do wish he would n't leave her so much alone . Young people today are n't brought up to stand loneliness . " " I was wondering , " Charlotte murmured , as she so frequentlymurmured with William ; for all families have traits in common which seem to hold them looped together . " I was wondering if something ought n't to be done about Roy . " " But what ? " Asa looked slightly startled . " I 've always felt , " Charlotte resumed , " that she behaved splendidly . It is all so different from the way wives used to cling and make trouble when we were young . " " But making trouble used to bring results , " Lavinia wailed . " And what on earth can we do for Roy that we have n't already tried ? " " It seems to me , we take too much for granted . " Charlotte'stone had dropped to a whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy to be wonderful just because she is different from us . " " Well , but what can we do for her ? " Asa demanded , and the note of resolution in his voice made Charlotte glance at him keenly . The mere mention of Roy 's name , she said to herself , appeared to touch some secret spring in his nature . " She does n't want any help . She told me that she had to save herself in her own way . " Though he spoke with pride , he was thinking , in a tremor of apprehension : But is she saving herself ? And for what ? Charlotte stirred uneasily , and her bulk , rolling slightly as she moved , filled out and overflowed the wide wings of her chair . " Well , I was n't really thinking , " she answered . " The idea just crossed my mind like that  --  " She snapped her thumb and forefinger while the emerald flashed a green light on her hand . " You know what a difference William has always made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because  --  ? " Lavinia 's question trailed off unfinished . Charlotte nodded . " Yes , Stanley made an effort to charm him . Men are not ever too old to wallow in flattery . "  | " She is very fond of him , " Lavinia retorted defensively . " She thinks he is  --  he is . . . " " Anyway , she was always nice to him , and she brightenedup that big empty house when she ran in and out . That 's why he gave her a car of her own  --  He hoped she would come oftener . " " And did she ? " Asa 's eyelids narrowed as they did when he was amused in spite of himself . " Come oftener ? I do n't know . You see , he 'd just given her the car for a wedding present when . . . when . . . " Lavinia shivered , slightly , as if a chill draught had blown through the room . " If he sends on the car , I might put in the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like Stanley 's , quivered , and she bit into it sharply . " Her winter clothes are all here , and I think Peter 's are too . Asa , do you know where Peter left his heavy things ? " " I told Virgie to pack them away in the spare room . The night after he left , I bundled them in there on the bed . " He made a sudden gesture , as if he were sketching something in the air . " I 'd like to get rid of them , damn him ! " " Why , Asa ! What will Aunt Charlotte think of you ? " Lavinia protested ; but Charlotte , when he caught her twinkling eye , appeared to think very well of him . " I hope he 'll let Parry drive the car up to Baltimore , " she said . " Then he could take anything we want to send . " She stood up and straightened the chiffon scarf on her shoulders . " Parry 's a good boy , " she continued , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William would help him with his education . It does seem hard , when so many half-wits are pushed through college . " " I do n't see what good it would do him , " Lavinia rejoined indifferently.  | " Maybe you 're right , " Charlotte admitted , " but I ca n't help feeling sorry . If he went North , nobody would ever guess he was colored , " she added with one of her amazing flashes of independence , " and at least somebody white , and probably quite a number of them , must be responsible for his complexion . " Lavinia bridled uneasily ; for there were occasions when she felt that Charlotte , who was her aunt only by marriage , was too indelicate for the superior taste of the Fitzroys . " All that was so long ago , " she murmured evasively . " I know . That 's what William says . It 's wonderful the way you Fitzroys all think alike . But Abel Clay 's family did belong to the Fitzroys for a good hundred years and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of his father before him . " Asa 's mouth twitched as it did when he was moved . " Your Aunt Charlotte is right , " he said . " I hate to see anything good wasted , and Parry has a good mind . Craig told me he was astonished to find how much law the boy had picked up just by reading at night . He seems to have an extraordinary memory for words  --  or , I suppose , it may be merely for sounds . " He turned his head and looked out into the night . " Good God ! When I think of the power of money . . . If he were all white and poor , would he be any happier ? " His mind had gone suddenly blank , but something , smothered yet alive , was struggling in a dark corner . What is it , he asked , with a malicious twist , that I am longingto do ? Overturn the shape of things as they are ? Challengethe dumb tyranny of circumstances ? Well , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I shall be done for in earnest . " No , but it would be easier to help him , " Charlotte an/swered . " Men like William would n't mind my helping him if he were all white . Even now , he likes my giving odd jobs to Parry , but there is n't enough paying work for them all , white and colored . " Asa frowned . " It 's hard for everybody . These are not easy times , though we 've known worse and come through them . The difference is that in worse times , we had something to stand on and to hold by . Even in Reconstruction and afterwards , we still believed in ourselves . " Charlotte laughed in a low chuckle . " If we had n't believed in ourselves , we could n't have hated the Yankees . It was hating , my mother used to say , that kept her alive . Hate was her one vital possession , she told me , and her last and only affirmation to life . " " I thought , " Asa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , anyway , the faculty of moral indignationis n't all that it used to be , and I doubt whether it ever exerted an undue influence in human affairs . " He remembered his own poor place in the factory , with a hungry mob waiting to oust him at the first sign that he was giving way , that he could n't keep up with the herd . His father would not have submitted so easily , but , then , in his father 's day , children as well as conditions were different . Or were they ? . . . It is bad for the young , too , because they are struggling in a time when there is room neither for youth nor age . No room for youth ! But I 'd rather drown myself , he thought , than be dependent upon my children  --  upon any children today . Not that Roy would n't divide her last crust with me , and Andrew too , for the matter of that . He might begrudge all that he doled out to me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party or the Relief Administration expected . No , it is n't that , Asa thought . It is simply that I 'd rather be dead than have to fall back on the best or the worst of my children . I 'd far rather sell pencils in the street or go to the City Home . . . . " That must be William , " Charlotte said warningly , for the doorbell was ringing . " He told me he would stop for me . " She flinched as if from pain , and her hand shot to her bosom . That fear is with her day and night , Asa thought . Even if the danger is over , for she is past seventy , and the doctor had said that the old were seldom afflicted , the fear still prowls in her consciousness . " Maybe he will come upstairs , " Lavinia called after Asa , who was hurrying down to the front door .

Lavinia was sitting up on her day-bed , and holdingout her hands in a gesture of welcome . Charlotte had moved out of the largest and softest chair , which she left vacant for William .

After the way she 's behaved , she 'd had the impudence to ask me to send her car on to Baltimore . " Lavinia sank back on her pillows and pressed a handkerchief to her bluish lips .

" William exclaimed , and then again , after a brief pause , " Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lavinia pressed in the point . " You . must not forget that . " William appeared to relax slightly . " Maybe so and maybe not . Anyway , that sports car is n't of much use shut up in my garage . I offered it to Roy , but she would n't touch it , and I ca n't say I blame her . But what 's the matter with Roy , I 'd like to know . Independent as the devil , with her everlasting I can look after myself , thank you . ' All these modern half-baked theories seem to have turned her head . Letting her own sister run away with her husband , and taking it all on the chin . Bought a red hat , too , the very next day , did n't she ? " He caught his breath and glared round at his wife . " When you asked her what steps she meant to take , did n't she tell you she 'd just stepped out to buy a red hat ? " " Yes , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it ! Do n't you think she was brave to try to keep up her spirit ? " William puffed out his lips in a sighing whistle . " It was brave , " he admitted , " but it was n't womanly . I like a woman to be womanly . " " The red hat did make a difference , " Charlotte continued mildly . " I do n't remember just how  --  but it seemed to sound a note  --  well , like a  --  challenge . " " Oh , I 'm not complaining of Roy , " William retorted . He looked round for a chair and sat down stiffly in the one from which his wife had just risen . While he settled himself comfortably , he uttered a low growl and glanced from Charlotteto Lavinia , as if he suspected they were trying to get something for nothing . Standing a little aside , Asa found himself thinking idly : Yes , it 's true , owning things is the curse of the world . Williamis an unattractive old man , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins , like the haphazard scratching of hens ; a pendulous jowl ; and a loose-lipped , sensual mouth under a bushy moustache , which is yellowwhiteat the ends . Yet his very ugliness , after the queer habit of extremes , is impressive . It does not detract , apparently , from his self-esteem or from his enjoyment of life . There was a rumor , no doubt exaggerated , that he maintaineda galaxy of mistresses , all very blonde and young , in New York ; though , in Queenborough , he was careful to observe the proprieties ; and he worshipped , beside his wife , every Sunday , in St. Luke 's Episcopal Church . Well , moneyp201is n't everything . Asa repeated the convenient formula of the shabby genteel , while he turned away and stared vacantly out of the window . Money was n't everything , ever , to William , who would have liked , one suspected , to buy something more lasting than platinum blondes ; and it was n't everything to Charlotte , who , though the price of her jewels might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incurable dread . No , wealth could not buy happiness , but it could make unhappiness more comfortable ; and even a broken heart , Asa reasoned , can not afford to despise comfort . Freedom , too , it could buy , he thought resentfully , freedom to cast back favors and reject obligations . " I ca n't see that there 's much to choose , " William was grumbling , " between the two men she took up with . Nincompoops , both of them . You could n't get one ounce of guts if you made sausage of the two together . I 'm not saying , mind you , that the girl deserves any better . She 's like all the rest of her empty-headed generation . " " Roy has pluck , " Asa said irritably . And so had my mother . It is n't the generation , it 's something else . When I think of the way my mother was brought up , and of all  --  of all . . . " While he stood there , frowning moodily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippled out again , as frail and fugitive as broken images in running water . He saw his mother bending over his crib , with roses in the coils and loops of her bright hair , and clouds of lace streaming over her white shoulders . Then , scarcely had this recollection dissolved and vanished , when it reassembled in the figure of an old and haggard woman scrubbing the tracked floor in a gray dawn , when the cook had not come . Oh , my God , he thought , shaken to the inmost depths of his being.  | " Perhaps it 's only the surface that 's changed , " Charlotte said soothingly . " We may talk differently , or even act differentlyon the outside ; but underneath , I doubt whether young people are really so changed . " " On the surface , " Lavinia repeated as brightly as if she were proclaiming , not a well-worn platitude , but an undiscoveredverity . " I 'm sure that it 's all on the surface . " " Well , I 'd never choose a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then a dash of his jocosehumor enlivened his tone . " I like ' em tender , " he added , relishing his own wit , " and I like ' em plump . " Charlotte started to speak , but the next instant she alteredher mind and bit back her words . Instead , she turned her unpolemical glance on Asa ; and he understood that fifty years in the thorough training of wifehood had taught her to value peace above firm convictions . " Stanley may be undisciplined , " Lavinia remonstrated gently , " but she has a sincere feeling for you , Uncle William . " If he failed to swallow this bait , she told herself , it would not be because she had stopped casting it on the troubledwaters . After a pause , in which she hoped the tempting morsel had gone down , hook and all , she added persuasively , " Do you remember the way she used to run in and out of your house just for a glimpse of you ? " Her tears overflowed , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under her pillow . " Poor child , she is alone now , among strangers . . . " William blew his nose furiously . " Well , maybe the car will help to keep her out of another  --  another . . . " Staring at him , in an unfriendly silence , Asa saw , with astonishment , that he was actually moved . In the sacred cause of property there were few crimes of which Williamp203was not capable . He could grind down a living wage to ' powder , or , to gratify some deep-seated instinct , he might exercisean unscrupulous power over a debtor . Yet any light scrap of fluff , Asa told himself , who thought it worth her while to play upon William 's senses , could wring tears from his hardened eyes , and persuade him to feather her lovenest . I wonder how much of his anger with Stanley , for all its air of moral indignation , is mere jealousy in a perverted form ? " Well , Charlotte , we 'd better be going home , " William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll see what I can do about that car . Not that she ought to have it . " " You 're so good , " Lavinia began , and then , detecting from his glazed eye that the epithet was inadequate , she hastily supplied an imposing substitute . " You 're so wonderful , Uncle William . I know Stanley will be overwhelmed by your kindness . " " Tell her it 's the last thing she 's going to get from me , the last blessed thing . Tell her she needs a sound whipping more than she needs a car , and in the old days she 'd have had her deserts . " His sly chuckle held a lustful note . " It must be nearly eleven , " Charlotte said , prodding him gently . " Lavinia ought to have been in bed long ago . " " Oh , I put it off as long as I can , " Lavinia replied . " I sleep so badly that I go to bed late , and Asa always sits up reading until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she added pleadingly , " when the car goes . I 'll have their winter things packed tomorrow . " " I 'll try to get it off in a day or two , " William answered . " Maybe I 'll have that boy Parry drive the car up to Baltimore . He 's a careful driver , I 'll say that for him . Now , you 'd better get to bed right away , and do n't let that hus- band of yours sit up stuffing his head from books . Books ! He 'd be better off today , and so would you , if he 'd never had a book in his hands after he learned reading and writing . Look at me ! I never read a book through in my life , and has that kept me from taking an important place in the world ? No , sir , I tell you the ideas people get out of books have made more trouble even than drink . " Bending over reluctantly , for she was no longer young , he brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , then , I 'll see what I can do about it , and I 'll let you know . " With an abrupt command to his wife , he turned away and stalked pompously out of the room . A few minutes later they heard his spluttering complaints in the hall below ; but by the time Asa and Charlotte had hurried after him , he had opened the front door and was waving impatientlyto Bradley , the chauffeur . " Are you going to spend the night , Charlotte ? Never saw such a woman for dawdling . Does n't know the meaning of time . Does n't even know the difference between day and night . " Yes , he was almost repulsive , without a single redeeming trait , Asa thought , watching him as the car rolled away , but a pillar , nevertheless , of a respectable world.  | STANDING in the doorway , Asa looked out under the thick boughs to the white glare on the corner . There was a faint wind in the branches , and the shadows were stirring on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in the city he could taste the bitter-sweet flavor of autumn . At Hunter 's Fare , he knew , the wind from the river would have sprung up ; colored leaves , blanched by moonlight , would hurtle over the grass to the house ; the earthy scents of smoke and woodmouldand cider would be strengthened by the fresh darkness . Inside the house , Kate would be lingering over her book ( for books overflowed the tables and chairs and were piled up in corners ) , and Pat and Percy would have their run out of doors before they went on guard for the night . Peace is there , he thought , in that house , with that friendship . Love comes , love goes ; but comradeship is woven of an indestructible element . I 'm sixty , he said to himself , with a sensation of panic . I 'm sixty , and my life is slipping away empty . He would soon be an old man . In ten years more he would be over the top . . . in twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to show for it . He was married ; he had children ; he had worked for over forty years ; but he felt , at the moment , that he had less than nothing to show for it all . Then his mood shifted . I 've had Roy , he said to himself . I shall always have Roy . While the thought was still in his mind , it seemed to evaporate . Had he really meant anything to Roy in her unhappiness , or even when she was happy ? There were times when he felt that , in her anguish of mind , she would sooner turn to any one else . That ca n't be true , he thought . I will never be- lieve it . For , with Roy estranged from him , he could see only that the bottom had dropped out of his universe . Kate was still there ; but even Kate could not fill the place Roy had left empty . A small sports car sped down the street , swept on through the glare at the crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute later Craig and Roy ran across the pavement and up the steps to the door . " What are you looking for , Father ? " " For tomorrow . Your Uncle William and Aunt Charlotte have just gone . " " Gone ? Then we came at the right moment . " " You must have passed them up the street . " " Maybe so . We were n't watching . " " Well , come in . Are n't you coming in , Craig ? " " Of course , he 's coming in . He 's coming in for a highball . Have you any whisky , Father ? " " I do n't know , my dear . I forgot to go to the A. B. C. yesterday . " What he meant , though he could not bring himself to say it , was that he had not the price of a bottle . In the old days , before Peter 's flight into freedom , it was Peter who kept the sideboard stocked with whisky and gin . " I 'm sorry I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember to bring some tomorrow . " Roy tucked her hand under her father 's arm and waited until he had fastened the door . Then she tossed her hat aside and led him into the dining-room . " Well , if you have n't , Mother has . Uncle William brought her a bottle of Scotch yesterday , and we 'd better look before I go rummaging in her closet . Mother hides things in the most ridiculous places . She suspects us all , even poor Virgie , of secret drinking . I 'll probably find this Johnnie Walker tucked away in her hatp207box or behind the shoes in her closet . " While she ran on , she was searching on the shelves of the sideboard , and after a brief hunt , she drew out a bottle of bourbon . " You left it here , and I put it away for you , " she said to Craig . How intimate her tone is , Asa thought , but aloud he said only , " You do n't drink , do you , daughter ? " Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I drink , old dear . Who does n't ? " But , after all the fuss about whisky , he noticed that she did not touch it , and Craig took only a small drink . They do n't know what they really are , these young people , Asa thought , but they obey an inner compulsion to make themselves appear worse . Was all their drinking , as well as their bad manners , which they called honesty , nothing more than bravado ? " I must keep a clear head , " Craig was saying . " I have to go home and write an article . " " An article on what ? " Asa asked . " What are you reformingnow ? " He remembered how liberal and advanced Craig had been before he had met Stanley , how eager to overturn every barrier in earth and sky , and to make everything , good or bad , different . " Reform ? Good Lord , no , " Craig replied . " We 've left reform miles behind us . You ca n't reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been possible in the past , now and then , to reform human behavior , and even to change , or at least control , human appetites . " " The whole trouble with your generation , " Craig retorted in his most irritating superior manner , " is that you depended too much on the past . You imagined history proved something . " He smiled and diluted his whisky from the siphon in front of him ; and his smile , as Asa had told himself so often before , was still charming , whether or not one admired his manner or agreed with his views . The recent cloud had lifted from his high forehead , and his eyes sparkled with a light brilliance . Yet was n't his charm , like his mind or his temperament , woven of immediate impressions and intuitions ? It comes and goes as a mood does , Asa thought , and it has nothing more constant than a mood to fall back upon . Craig must have looked like this when Stanley first knew him ; it was her influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frowning sky . Watching him in this altered light , Asa had a swift feeling that he had learned to know Stanley better . He could understand at last why she had fallen in love with Craig in the beginning , and he understood also why in the end she had fallen out of love . There was all the difference between the man who is masterof himself and the man who has surrendered to a magnetismthat he resents . She had set herself , Asa mused , to the task of making over a lover , and she had come at last to despise , perhaps even to hate , the thing she had made . With all his fine points , Craig had been as wax in her hands , and Stanley , who worshipped power , could never forgive where she dominated . " Did you find a place to go ? " Asa asked , wondering whether they thought him the nuisance he felt himself to be at the moment . " Are n't Sunday meetings always a background for sermons ? " " Nobody called them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . She threw an encouraging smile at Craig over her father 's shoulder . " But Craig said the best things . He 's fine when he begins to speak . " " About what ? " " Oh , about everything . About the housing problem and the way people are made to live and the right to happi/ness . . . " She spoke lightly , but he decided , while he listened , that even if she were not wholly serious , she was probably serious enough . If only she could learn to accept life and love less deeply , she would be happier in the future . Yet she took them so deeply , he told himself , because she placed nothing above them . Though she had broken with the past , and the fragments of tradition were still scattered about her , could she ever find a refuge , or even security , in the things that are timeless ? Or was she , like so many of her age and way of life , driven by forces she could not understandtoward an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd better see about your mother 's milk , " he said . " I 'm glad of this new interest . By the time you 've read all the books Craig is lending you , " he chaffed , " you may be able to teach your old fogey father to feel at home in his world . " " But you do think that things ought to be different , " Roy said almost reprovingly . " Different . Oh , Lord , yes . I 'd change everything , if I could , beginning with the electron and ending with human nature . You may not believe it , but I 've never had a high opinion of things as they are . " " Well , you 're a lot more radical than the rest of us . " Craig ran his hand untidily through his thick dark hair . " All we want to do is to make the world a little more decent . " A warm glow was suddenly shed into Asa 's mind ; for somewhere in his buried life the embers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how youth felt ; he could even feel with it . In everything , except the rational and physical parts , he thought , in all the fantastic dreams and the lost horizons , he was still as young as he had ever been . So short a time ago as this Sunday afternoon , he had watched the larks whirring up from the autumn fields , and had grasped the sense of delight before it escaped him . I never had that in youth , he thought . It was what I 've always wanted , but I never felt it before . Aloud he said presently , " Perhaps I 'm not so old as I look , my boy , or is it so unintelligent ? " " Oh , you 're all right . " Roy beamed on him affectionately , but there was something lacking , he felt vaguely , in her reassurance . " Right you are ! " Craig repeated , tossing off his whisky and water . They were kind to him , Asa knew ; they were trying to make him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their way . Yet he knew also that , in spite of the struggling youth in his heart , he could not speak to them in their own tongue . Not a generation but a mental hemisphereseparated the two angles of vision . Youth and middle-agehad never looked at the same landscape ; they did not see the same objects . I 'm in sympathy with them , he said to himself , and added in the next breath : But they have n't learned the first thing about order . They do n't know how to reason . They have fine ideas without a string of logic to hold them together . They have made a cult of loose thinking , of disarrangement and rowdiness . Even the dandy of our day , he thought , with his eyes on Craig 's rumpled head and limp collar , might have given a lesson in method to the popular tough guy of the present . Then , after a moment : But this boy has something the dandy lacked , and that  --  well , I suppose that is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Upstairs , while Lavinia was sipping her hot milk , he heard Craig go out and the front door shut after him . " I 'd betterp211run down and lock up , " he said . " Roy always forgets some-thing . " " She never seems to think that locking up matters , " Laviniaassented . " They all behave as if being murdered in your beds were- a part of the day 's work . " " Well , I 'll finish after her , " he replied , glad to escape while Lavinia was still awake . Downstairs , he found that Roy had remembered to bolt the door , but Virgie , in the carelessness of her genial race , had neglected to lock up at the back of the house . " You liked the meeting ? " he asked , trying to arrest and keep the look in Roy 's face , which was eager and interested . There was a warm dusky red in her cheeks , and her gray eyes were luminous . " Oh , well , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And what did they talk about ? " She laughed . " About the state of the world , and what ought and ought not to be done . . . " Her voice trailed off into vagueness . " Craig talked very well . " " About the state of the world , and what ought and ought not to be done , " Asa repeated . " Sometimes they looked as if they wanted to fight , but that was when they talked about voting . It was rather excitingwhen they began to quarrel . I did n't know Craig had it in him . " " Had what in him ? " " Oh , I do n't know . . . grit , pluck , spunk . Uncle Williamwould call it guts , only he does n't think that Craig has any . " " Well , I 'm glad you like Craig , " Asa said . " I think there 's a good deal more to him than your Uncle William suspects . " " He 's nice to go about with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? " " I mean , he notices . He can see the color in the sky , and he knows that the change from baseball to football is n't the only way to tell when it is autumn . Some men do n't know any more than that about seasons . There 's Andrew . . . " " Andrew is a fine boy in his way . He 's never given your mother or me a moment 's anxiety . " She shrugged her thin shoulders . " Well , all I said was , there 's Andrew . . . " She was thinking of Peter , he knew . Though Peter had disappeared from her outward life , he was still present in her thoughts , and perhaps in her emotions . " I knew you 'd like Craig , " Asa said hurriedly , " as soon as you began to see more of him . It may sound absurd to you , but Craig and I have a good deal in common . You need n't think because I wear a hat and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , you 've never said anything . " " Maybe so , but I 've been thinking like blazes . " She put her hand on his arm . " You 've had a mean life , poor old dear . I wonder if all lives look mean when you come close up to them ? " Her tone had altered now ; the happier moment had gone by . He thought of her eyes , eloquentwith laughter , when she came in with Craig . Then , as she started to move away and glanced back at him , he saw that the light had died . They looked haunted , those eyes . " Good night , Daddy . " " Good night , my darling . Sleep well . " But neither of them , he knew , would sleep well . She would be caught up again in the old horror of desire and repulsion , of memories more vivid than life ; and he would sink back into the helpless pity which is as intolerable as physicalp213pain . If only he had something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had fallen , he told himself , between an age that was slipping out and an age that was hastening in ; and faith in life , which had once been an active conviction , now survived , when it survived at all , merely as a fixed habit of mind . I ca n't help it , he thought , stubbornly . I ca n't help my antiquated sense of responsibility for things I can do nothing about . I ca n't help harboring the absurd notion that there is a dignity attached to the state of man . Yet he could reflect , on his way upstairs to Lavinia 's room , that it was splendid to be young and magnanimous and irresponsible ... Toward the end of the week , at six o'clock one morning , when he was making Lavinia 's early coffee , Parry stopped to pick up the suitcases , which were waiting in a row on the doorstep . As Asa was filling the percolator , he heard a car stop by the alley gate , and Parry came through and knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy for several months , and his first thought was , Parry looks as if he 'd been having a hard time . There were hollows under his eyes , and his expression was more sullen , as if it had fed on a grievance . But when he smiled his face lost its moodiness , and his features were brightened by a flash of intelligence . He was dressed in his Sunday suit of navy blue serge , with a new striped shirt and necktie , and a good felt hat which Peter had given him a year ago . " I was afraid I 'd have to wake you up , Mr. Asa , " he said . " Oh , I 'm an early bird . I never get much sleep after day-break . " Parry grinned , and the animation made him appear carelessand happy . " I 've been getting ready most of the night . Ma pressed my suit for me while I was going over the car.  | I want to stop in Washington long enough to see the Lincoln Memorial . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I 've never been out of Queenborough , except down to the beach on an excursion . " " Well , I 'm glad you have the chance . Have you had break-fast ? " " Yes , sir . Ma got up before day and cooked some for me . It 's a good morning , so Pa 's been tidying up his bor-ders . " Asa nodded . " That 's a nice garden . I wish I had as good a back yard . " Why was it , he asked himself again , that he could never feel perfectly at ease with the boy ? There was something about Parry , who was neither white , brown nor black , which appeared to defy grouping or classification . There was a kind of unconscious pathos which disturbed the older man , and awakened , strangely enough , an obscure and illogical sense of contrition , as if he himself were to blame for some act of injustice in which he had taken no part , and of which he had not been aware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place anywhere ; he did not belong in any unit . He stood wistfully between two hostile elements . He remained outside the life of his age ; yet he was living intensely in every nerve and sinew . " How are you coming on , Parry ? " " Just the same , sir . I ca n't see much ahead of me . " " You 've started back to school , have n't you ? " " No , sir . I got the scholarship , and I 'm taking the classes at college . I go out every morning and come home to sleep . I 'm doing a part time job at night in a service station , and Ma and Pa are helping me save up for the University in Washington . But I do n't seem able to do enough studying . "  | " Well , I hope you 'll work it out . Have you all the money you need for this'trip ? " That was n't what he had meant to say , but it was the only thing that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . He knew too well the loneliness of being apart from life ; yet all that he could think of was to ask him if he needed a few dollars . Craig would say that one should not consider individuals , but aggregates ; yet an aggregate remained , for Asa , merely a collection of individuals . " Yes , Sir , I 've got a plenty . Mr. William gave me some money for my board and oil and gas , and Ma fixed me up a lunch for two days . " " I hope you 'll enjoy it . " Asa drew out his shabby pocketbookand unfolded a dollar note . " Maybe you 'd like to go to the movies tonight . " A pang of something like self-reproachseized him . Was he trying to stay a hungry mind by offering it a paper dollar ? " Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . " Parry folded ' the dollar and put it into his purse before he stooped to pick up two of the suitcases . " Is there anything I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there safely . Miss Stanley is waiting for her car . " " I 'm a good driver . That 's why Mr. William is sending me . " " You 've an uncle in the North , have n't you ? " " That 's Uncle Amos . He went to New York , but he says it 's harder getting on in the North than in the South . Rent and food are way over your head in Harlem . And there are n't any jobs for colored people up there . He 's back now , working in a tobacco factory . I wonder if it 's any use trying , Mr. Asa ? "  | " I should n't give up , Parry , " he replied presently . " Nothingis easy . " " Yes , sir . I reckon that 's so . " As Parry looked round , a ray of brightness shone for an instant in his face , as sunshinewavers and vanishes under a cloud . " I 'll get on some-how . " With a suitcase in each hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the car . After he had packed them away in the back , he returned for the others and carried them away with him . Then the slight figure in the neat blue suit passed through the gate into the alley , and a few minutes later there was the sound of the car starting . Pausing in the open doorway , Asa gazed after him with a vague feelingthat something ought to be done about life , but he did n't know what it could be . Then he turned back to the gasrangeand lifted the bubbling percolator from the flame.  |p217ALL  her life had been ruled by chance , Roy thought , while she watched the white and gray pigeonsflutter down past her window . The whole ofexistence appeared to her as a vast accident . She had first met Peter because she had turned a strange corner and had driven , down an unknown road , toward disasterand heartbreak . If that had not happened , if she had turned in a familiar direction , or if he had not passed her and looked back at one particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Queenborough without ever meeting each other . But the moment of that first meeting was there , ringed round by an unfading glow , preserved in some imperishable element , deep down in the stillness of thoughts which lived on after thinking and feeling were over . And it will be there , that moment , she told herself , when I am old or dead or a mere handful of blown dust . Neither will nor desire , but accident , had created an image that would outlast both will and desire . But , now , it is over , it is finished forever , she said to herself , looking out of her window down to the pavement , where the pigeons moved in ' a dream among moving shadows . Even if the bare outline persists , I have left all that was vital behind me ; I shall never remember , except when I am asleep . She would keep no share in the past ; she would refuse to acknowledge its power of survival ; she would deny , not only its truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , glancing round at the room , which remembered . For what , after all , had bound her to Peter ? What was the meaning or the nature of a love which had seemed to touch the heights , as well as the depths , of her being ? They had had nothing in common , she saw now , denying while she reflected , nothing but that quiver of the nerves and the flesh , that surprise , that wonder , that eager sense of something precious which hitherto had been missing from life . Beyond this , scarcely a belief , a liking , a shared interest . But that alone had been everything , and now that also was nothing . And she had forgotten . But , oh , Peter , Peter , what pain , what bitter anguish , there is in forgetting ! And Craig too . His unhappiness and his need of her had been the result of a chance meeting . After Roy 's divorce , he had abruptly disappeared . He had avoided the Timberlakes ' house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andrew , whose friend he had been , said that Craig had moved out of the apartment , without leaving a message or an address for his letters . " I 'm afraid he 's taken to drink , " Andrew had said regretfully , " but he ca n't stand it . He 's the sort of chap who can get drunk on anything . Even ideas fly to his head . I wish , " he added indignantly , " that Stanley had chosen to play ball with somebody else . Craig was too good for her . " " I wonder if Peter is , " Roy had retorted scornfully , driving the blade into her heart . " But , I suppose , she 'll marry every sort till she finds just what she 's looking for in her bed . " " Roy , how can you ? " Lavinia had remonstrated ; but Andrew had exclaimed with boisterous admiration , " That 's right , Roy . I call that sporting ! " For an instant , the fresh wound had seemed to draw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache was renewed . It does n't do any good , she told herself . Not any good in the world . . . .  |p219That  was in August , and the next day , late in the afternoon , she met Craig as she was passing through Jefferson Park . The day had been one of torrid heat , and the shadows aslant the gravelled walks looked as if they were emblazoned on silver . A little earlier , when she had just come home from work , Aunt Charlotte had asked her to motor out into the country ; but she had dreaded the long conversation , and after a bath and a vain effort to rest , she had slipped into a chiffon frock and come out of doors into the grassy square at the intersection of Westward Avenue and Granite Boulevard . The leaves on the maples , yellowing in the sun and edged with a reflected transparency , hung as motionless as if they were cut out of brass . Underfoot , were all the sordid and disfiguring signs of an overheated humanity ; a litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddies of dust scattered by dragging feet ; watermelon seeds , shreds of orange peel or half-rotten peaches ; and here and there a broken toy or a tattered balloon , which children had thrown away . It was better indoors , Roy said to herself , and then pausingabruptly before a slouching figure on one of the green benches , she exclaimed , " Craig ! " in a horrified tone . He sprawled there against the back of the bench , his long legs crossed over the concrete curb , and the distraught wretchednessin his gaze fixed upon vacancy . The planes of his face , she thought with sudden pity , had shrunk into hollowsand angles , as if the inner padding of flesh had witheredbetween the skin and the bone . Poor Craig , he had deserved better than this . Why had this happened to him , when his nerves were so near the surface that one could almost watch them as they writhed and twisted in pain ?  | He was finer than Stanley , he was finer than Peter ; and because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig , " she repeated gently , touching his arm . At her touch , at the sound of her voice , a quiver ran through his features while he lifted his sunken head and looked into her face . His strange eyes , flashing from darkenedsockets , held a savage loneliness , and she wondered whether he had been drinking too much and too long . But his tone , when he spoke , was quite steady , and so flat and dull that she understood he was drunk only with despair or with emptiness . To her horror , she saw that he was beginning to look neglected and shabby . Who would have recognizedin him the Craig who had loved Stanley , who had become , for her sake , an exile from that world of theory which was the native atmosphere of his mind ? He was , as he had always been , Roy thought , out of touch with the naked structure of facts , or with any stable pattern of living . This was the cause of her old impatience with him , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed into his defenseless eyes , that , if this inner vision was his weakness , it was also , in a measure at least , his strength . He was the finer because of his detachment from an imperfectscheme of existence . He was  --  she groped for the right word  --  nobler . Yes , that was the flaw in her thinking : a discarded epithet now needed to be revived by a generation which had rejected nobility . Though Craig accepted the new social labels , he still harbored the old moral antipathies . While he thought with the confused present , he was linked emotionally with those higher passions which distinguish between right and wrong , not only in the mass , but in individualrelationships . Otherwise , why should he have de/manded both love and loyalty in Stanley , who was capable only of self-delusion ? Ironically , Roy remembered her mother 's classification of human beings into persons of good or bad blood . How easy living , and especially loving , must have been when people believed , or even acted as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood " had ever done for Craig was to leave him stranded on some uncertainlevel between the Has-been and the Not-yet . He would always be attractive , she thought , tracing the bleak contourof his face , but the type had worn thin . It was too brittle to stand the barbaric thrusts of the actuality . " I did n't know you at first , " he said , rising and grasping her hand . " But I knew you , " she answered , playing for time until she could collect her faculties and think of something to say . " How are you , Craig ? " " I 'm fine . How are you ? " " Fine too , " she laughed mockingly . " That 's nice , is n't it ? " " Yes , that 's nice . " While he spoke , she could see his thoughts groping , groping through vacancy . " What , " she demanded , " have you been doing ? " His glance dropped from her face and wandered over the bleached grass and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Well , sit down and tell me about it . " - Why , she wonderedirritably , should she bother ? It was no concern of hers ; Craig was no concern of hers , however she looked at him . No , I ca n't be bothered with him , she told herself , I 'll speak only a word or two . It was n't fair that Stanley , who was without depth , should have been able to ruin Craig , who had more depth than a man needed for happiness . But , at least one could talk with him , Roy thought with relief , asp222if her over-charged mind were suddenly eased of its burden . She could talk with him , because he was the only other human being who had suffered with her , pang for pang , from the same cause . She longed , with a bursting heart , to pour out a torrent of words . Only , what was there left for her to speak ? He dropped on the bench beside her and turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the sunset . The light flared and sank in his eyes , while she watched the reflection of an unforgotten agony waver and vanish . But it may have been merely the trembling shadows of the leaves in which a faint breeze had quivered and died . " I 've been thinking of you , Roy , " he said . " Why did n't you come ? " " I wanted to , but I could n't . Once I got as far as the corner . " " Where have you been ? Andrew said you were n't at your office . " " I 've been moving about . I 've been trying to shake things . Do you know what it means , Roy ? Does anybody know what it means ? " " Can you ask that , " she cried savagely , " of me ? " Interest dawned in his look . For the first time , he appeared to fasten upon her his wandering attention . " Then you know it 's living in hell . " " As if I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremor of aversion ran through her nerves . A woman might suffer , a woman must suffer through love , she thought ; but a man should be different . A man should be strong enough . to rise above the regrets and denials and betrayals of life . She liked a man to be victorious in conflict , to trample down and destroy the enemies of his happiness . Peter had beenp223like that , and she had loved Peter . Aloud , she continued after a pause : " It 's not fair that they should spoil our lives . They are not worth remembering . " " Shall we ever forget them ? " " I will forget him . " She flung out her hand as if she were threatening a shadow . " Every hour I 'm moving farther away from him . " " What do you do with yourself ? Are you still decoratingyour houses for new lovers ? " " I work harder than ever . I pretend to be interested . If only I can pretend long enough , it may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , never , when I can help it , do I let myself think of him . " " Can yoo help it ? " " In the day  --  almost . But at night it is harder . Dreams are hardest of all . " Terror  --  or was it merely the image of a thought ?  --  leaped into his eyes . " She never leaves me alone , " he muttered . " God damn her , she never leaves me alone . " " You must keep her away . You must not let her come back . Oh , Craig , you must keep her away ! " A spasm convulsed his features , but it was soon over . Heaven be praised that he did not burst into tears . Had he cried , she could not have forgiven him ; she could not have forgotten . " I 've tried everything , " he answered . " Nothing does any good , not even drink . I ca n't get drunk enough to do any good . " " Have you tried working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head stubbornly . " I 've wanted only to put an end . . . " " And all for her ! " The anger in her voice scorched him . " Ca n't you see she is n't worth any of it ? Ca n't you see oh ,  |p224you  poor blind fool , ca n't you see ? " Inflamed by resentment , she flashed round on him . " If you give a thing like that power over your life , you 're no better than she is . You 're a man of straw , and I 'll not be bothered with you . " Without rising , he stared up at her in bewilderment . " You ca n't fight a running fire with words , " he said . " Do you think I like this ? Do you think . . . ? " " Then why do you stand it ? Oh , but you do like it . " Her eyes blazed . " You like being hurt . There 's a kind of pleasure . . . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you do n't . You simply lie down and let the misery wash over you . " She had tossed her hat on the bench , and everything about her , from the scornful curl of her lips to her dark waving hair , appeared to spring upward , alive and glowing , in the flame of the afterglow . The greenish light under the leaves shone in her eyes ; and it seemed to her , as she gazed at him , that the whole scene was dissolving and swimming in a circular motion , as if they stood together in the depths of the sea . His features wore the distorted and unreal look of a drowned face that is seen under an ebbing tide . " Do n't go , " he pleaded , for the moment had broken in two , and she had stooped to pick up her hat . He raised his hand to his eyes , as if brushing away a delusion . " You might help me . You are the only person alive who might help me . " Her impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the ground . " I must help myself . That is all I can do . " " I 'd like to see you again . " " What 's the use ? I ca n't bother . It 's true , what I told you . I believe there 's something in you that enjoys being hurt . "  | " You mean , by Stanley ? " His lips quivered with pain . " As long as you still love her or hate her . Which is it ? " He shook his head . " I do n't know . " " Well , I do n't enjoy being hurt , and I 'm going to stop it . " She turned away , but he followed her . " Let me see you again , Roy . " " Our door is open . " " I want to see you alone . You shake me up . You do me good . But I could n't stand your mother  --  not yet . " " She was fond of you . So was Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But you never really liked me . " " I did . I liked you well enough  --  but , oh , I do n't know You talked so much about social responsibility , and you let yourself be pulled to pieces by any passion that was lying around . Your ideas were fine , but they were all  --  well , just air-plants . " She broke off and looked at him . " Do you supposeanybody has ever been saved by a theory or helped by a sermon ? " " I 'm the last person on earth to answer that . I 've lost everything I ever believed in . " " It may come back . Some day , when you 're not expecting it , everything may come back . Even Uncle William , who thinks your views are all poppycock , admits that you meant well . " " Damn it ! That 's my curse . I mean well , even now . I 'm a member of that forlorn company , the men of good will . " Her lip curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm not going to be beaten . " " You are n't a misfit , and I am . I have always disappointed people , ever since I came into the world at the wrong time and cost my mother her life . In the beginning , my father could n't bear the sight of me . Then he started trying to make me over into something I was not intended to be . He wanted me to be the last Southern gentleman of the Old School . So he sent me to the University of Virginia , where I went native  --  or roughneck . Then he thought he 'd make an intellectual by sending me to Harvard . And Harvard turned me into a Communist . Tough on the old chap , you know . I used to think him a pompous ass , but I 've come to see he has something  --  I do n't know what it is . He 'll be ninety-three his next birthday , and he 's never been broken  --  he 's never even been bent . He 's had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ran away to finish a war , and rebuilt the family fortunes after Sheridan went by . He got on , too , withoutwhat we call a higher education , and without the help of any benevolent Red Cross or committees for devastated regions . Yes , he has something . I see all that , though we ca n't be together for five minutes without going up in the air . . . Still , there 's something . It may be only that he 's kept the simple values we 've got rid of . He 's primitive enough to believe there 's some meaning  --  some kind of centerin the mess of things . . . " Craig choked back a laugh . " A queer bird to be still alive ! Caught in a wheel-chair , but holding on tight . " " It 's a pity you are his only hope . " " Yes , he needed another son  --  or a dozen of them . All my sisters are quite splendid examples of petrified Southern ladies . Well , that 's that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , " he demanded , " that will kill love ? " Her eyes mocked him . " Only another love . It takes love to kill love . " Yes , that was true , she thought , with a flash of startled insight . Passion alone could destroy passion . Allp227the thinking in the world could not make so much as a dent in its surface . " Let me see you soon , Roy , " he asked again . His eyes softened in the flushed light , and his relaxed figure stiffened . " There is so much we want to say to each other . " Was he , she wondered in silence , deliberately trying to whip up a new emotion ? Well , no matter , she was sick of emotion . Yet it was true ; they had much to say to each other . Suddenly , it seemed to her that her heart was swollen to bursting with all the things she could not say to any one else . Only to Craig , who was enduring life 's cruelty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Only to Craig . . . " If you knew , Roy . . . " " If I knew ! Do you think there 's anything you feel that I do n't know ? " " Then come back tomorrow . " " There is n't any use . I ca n't stand any more . I ca n't take on anything else . " " You can help me . Good God , it 's hell on earth , I 've told you , and I 'm trying to get out of it . " " But you are n't trying . " " You do n't know . Nobody knows . I 'd do anything  --  anything to fill up that emptiness . " Her anger had faded , and she gazed at him with dispassionateeyes . " Ca n't you make yourself look less  --  less trampled on ? " " Does it matter a damn ? " She frowned . " It matters two damns . How long has it been since you had a hair-cut ? Your clothes look as if you 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welled up in his thin cheeks . " I do n't know . I have n't thought of it . "  | " It 's time to think of it . A man has to stand up , or pretend to . The first thing I did was to buy a red hat . Men miss a lot because they are n't allowed to wear red . " " I might wear a red necktie . " " Yes , that would help . Red has courage in it . Anything is better than the drabness of misery . " " It matches my face . " He laughed frankly , while a glimmerof admiration enlivened his features . " Well , change it and see . " " Will you come back tomorrow ? I 'll bring the car , and we can go somewhere we 've never been . Do you mind my not coming up to the house ? I feel , somehow . . . " " Mind ? " she taunted him flippantly . " I am standing on the edge of a precipice , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if it mattered any longer what is done , or is n't done , by other people ! " " Then you 'll come to the corner ? I 'll be waiting there whenever you say . " " Yes , that 's better . I could n't stand having to explain things to Mother . Her window looks down on the front . " Still , she hesitated . " I 'll come , " she added presently , " if you 'll promise me to go back to work . " " I 'll promise anything . What 's a promise ? " " And you 'll keep it ? " " I 'll even keep it . I 'll go back to that office , but I ca n't promise you any clients . " " But somebody is there . " " I suppose Appleby is still on the job  --  if there 's any job left . " " And you 'll take the first case into court ? You have to help yourself if you expect me to help you . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you wo n't lease me alone . " Attractive but ineffectual , she thought as she looked at him . Could she do anything with such weakness ? Was it worth while to bother ? Was she only making more trouble for herself in a world which already contained an abundance ? Would this unpromising association prove to be as futile or as disappointing as most human ties ? Life had taught her the bitter lesson that her will was Independent , but her emotion could be too easily and too deeply involved . Pity alone drew her to Craig ; yet she had learned that pity could become in itself a destructive force . Well , it was too late . She had been touched by Craig 's appeal , and she had silently made her decision . " Come a little before six , " she said , " and I 'll go with you unless Mother has an attack . " All that was in August , when the days were long and hot , and the trees were in full leaf . Now it was October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling.  | THE day was Sunday , and light was pointing with long thin fingers over the huddled roofs . Roy heard her father on his way downstairs , and she hoped he would bring her a cup of coffee ; since autumn came , and the nights had grown longer , he had fallen out of that agreeable habit . I suppose he thinks I 'm asleep , she thought , because once or twice I 've pretended to be when he came upstairs . She had planned to motor out into the country with Craig , and Maggie had promised to sit with her mother until Asa came in . But late last night Andrewhad telephoned that he and Maggie and the children were all asked to spend the day on a James River plantationwith one of the more important members of his company . " Of course , they must go , " Lavinia had assented plaintively . " If Asa would rather not stay with me , I am quite able to be left by myself . " " But you ca n't be left alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought old Mrs. Bredalbane was coming to see you. , , " You ca n't count on her , Roy . She 's eighty , if a day , in spite of trying to dress young , and she grows flightier all the time . " " Well , there 's Aunt Charlotte or Mrs. Littlepage . " " Charlotte may drop in after supper , but she is obliged to go somewhere with William , and of course Louisa Littlepage is tied up with a visiting lecturer . " " Then why ca n't we keep Selina all day ? Father needs a breath of fresh air . " " Selina would n't stay on at any price . No colored servant will give up her Sunday afternoon . "  | " Oh , I 'll stay , " Asa had said , and though he had spoken reluctantly , still he had spoken . Had he really minded so much ? Roy asked herself now . Did people who were growing old care when they missed things ? Did they enjoy and suffer as intensely as young people did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hunger ? He liked the woods and fields , but he could n't actually suffer , she imagined , whenever he gave them up . He could n't possibly care for that nice Mrs. Oliver in the way he might have cared for a woman when he was young . She was sorry he had to stay at home on a fine day , but it was n't , of course , as if it mattered a great deal . Anyway , she could never know , because , with a father and daughter , there was always a kind of primitive reticence . Or was this true of all human beings when time flowed between them ? The sunshine had grown stronger . Over the greenish steeple of a church , a single flight of birds shot with an arrowy swiftness through the golden air . When I see beauty , she thought , suddenly desperate , I feel that I must have love , or I shall die . If I ca n't have love , I would rather see ugliness . . . Shutting her eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the new orders , of the samples of wall-paper and chintz . But it was no use . The colors tumbled together , green , blue , red , orange , yellow , purple , and shifted into a kaleidoscopic design . When she was up and dressed and walking about , she could keep a firm hand on her thoughts ; but lying in bed , unarmed and relaxed , she could no longer cut off the rapid stream of impressions . Though she shut her eyes to the blue sky and the flight of birds and the firecoloredmaples , the morning brightness still poured in and troubled her mind . Only in love , only perhaps in the fulfil/ment of love , she told herself , could one find freedom from restlessness . Craig had come to mean more to her . But how much ? Her thoughts hesitated , quivered , and rushed back again to that meeting in August , and over the many hours and days they had spent together since then . Gradually , he had grown to depend on her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at last to value , his utter dependence . His weakness , she knew , was a bond between them , awaking some obscure and perhaps thwarted impulse to protect . There was none of the shock and the delicious violence of first love in the emotion she felt ; yet it might be , she understood , only the more constant for the lack of that fugitive ecstasy . It does n't fill my life , she thought , but it colors the drabness . Almost every afternoon since mid-summer he had called for her at the shop ; and they had spent every Sunday motoringor roaming on country roads . As she grew to know him better , she became more sensitive to his charm and his magnanimousimpulses . It would be easy to love him if she had never . . . but , oh , Peter . . . She sat up quickly , reached for one of Craig 's books lying upon the bedside table , and opening it at random , she read , without fear and without hope , the apocalyptic prophecies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must no doubt be travelled . But as each of the concluding scenes of the last act of the tragedy of Capitalism is played out , more and more millions of the American people will grasp the purport of the whole play . . . They lack nothing on earth for the building up of an incomparable civilization upon the American continent . For them there is no question of undertaking the desperate , if heroic , process of laying thep233foundations of the industrialisation of a continent  --  the task which the Russian workers are accomplishing . " Well , perhaps ; but the prospect did not excite her . It would take more than a bloody road , she thought derisively , more even than the last act of Capitalism , to excite a woman who had been abandoned by her lover . . . . Suddenly , it seemed to Roy that she felt the narrow coils of identity , of the warped personal element , strangling her consciousness . If only there were something larger and deeper than self in which one might plunge and sink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . . . but every way , even that strange bloody road , would lead back in memory to what had been happiness  --  to what had been Peter . . . . When she came down to breakfast , her father had just finished his Sunday morning cereal with cream . On week days the supply of cream was restricted to a gill for Lavinia ; and Asa , who liked all rich and succulent food , had come to look forward to his Sabbath indulgence . " Good morning , daughter . " His proud and tender gaze enveloped her . " That 's a pretty frock . " " I bought it yesterday . " " It looks well on you . Would you call it russet or sorrel ? " Roy laughed as she sat down and smiled at Virgie , who was smiling back over the cereal . " Neither . It 's dusty cinna-mon . " " Well , it looks like autumn . You 've a fine day for an out-ing . " " It 's a pity you have to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may get a walk before Virgie goes . " His eyes held the long steadiness of one who has ceased to expect . " Did Mother have a bad night ? "  | " She was restless at first , but after that she slept fairly well . " " That 's why you did n't make the coffee . " " Did you miss it ? I wish I had known . I came down about dawn . " She looked at him while he tapped his egg . " Poor Father , you ought to have had something more . " " But I 've had oatmeal , my dear , and an egg . " " Oh , I did n't mean that . I meant more of  --  well , more of life . You ought to have had millions . " Self-reproach ruffled her thoughts . He looked tired and gray and shabby , and the puckers around his near-sighted eyes were deeper than ever . " My darling child , it 's hard enough to keep decent on nothing . There 's Craig 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wants a whole long day out of doors . I wish you were going too . " " Do you , daughter ? Well , so do I. But do n't worry about me . You and Virgie must make the most of your freedom . Is it the same follower , Virgie ? " " He sholy is , suh , ef'n I kin manage to keep a holt on him . De young dey ai n't easy to ketch , an ' I ain ' nevah yit had no truck wid an ole man . Dar 's Mr. Craig at de do ' now . Must n't I let him in ? " " Ask Miss Roy . He 's her young man . " " Must n't I ax ' im in ter breakfust , Miss Roy ? " " Yes , you 'd better ask him . He 's probably forgotten it . " As Virgie bustled to the door , Roy turned her head and waited expectantly , with a welcoming smile in her eyes . " Come to breakfast , Craig , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , and it 's going to be a happy day . " " And we have n't an idea where we 're going . " He held her hand , for an instant , before turning to Asa . " That 's the bestp235thing about happiness . It does n't have to know its direction . " " He looks cured , " Roy told herself , with a sudden warmth at her heart . " I believe he is really cured . " " What will you have , Craig ? " Asa asked . " Oatmeal first ? " " Dey ain ' no mo ' cream , " Virgie said , with sepulchral gloom . " Dey 's aigs and dey 's middlin ' . " " That so ? " Craig replied hastily . " Well , I do n't want oatmeal . I must keep my youthful figure . How about another cup of coffee ? I 've had two already . " " Hat 's too many , Mr. Craig . You is gwinter git de cawfy habit . " Virgie had sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still African beneath her dark gingerbread skin . " I reckon I 'd better weaken it some , " she added , lifting the percolator . " Not on your life ! You would n't believe it , Virgie , but I 've drunk as many as five pots of coffee in one night . " " Naw , suh , I ' ould n't , but , ef'n you ax me , you is gwinter be as yaller as a punkin . I kin tell jes ' ter look at you , Mr. Craig , dat yo ' skin ain ' natchel . " After filling his cup , she carried the percolator back to the kitchen , where they could still hear her grumbling under her breath as she added more water . " Here 's a heap a things dat ai n't natchel in dese yer times . " " Are you ready ? " Craig asked , looking at Roy . " As soon as I get my hat and speak to Mother . I suppose I 'd better wear a hat , had n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airily . " I never wear one . " " Bring a coat anyway , " Asa called after her as she ran upstairs . " There was a sharp frost last night . " " It 's a fine morning , " Craig said . " Are you going out ? " " Not out of town . " Asa 's voice flattened suddenly , for he remembered that he must telephone to Kate , who would come to the cross-roads . She would be sitting there , in her mud-splashed Ford , when the omnibus stopped and the few passengers alighted . Her smile would waver and disappear , and she would call Pat and Percy , who would be waiting beside the car . Their eyes , disappointed and questioning , would turn at the sound of her voice , and they would ask , in their wordless language , what had happened , and why he had not come ? Recalling his mind with a jerk , he added hurriedly : " It looks as if the war scare had passed over . " Craig nodded gloomily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " More than you 'd think . . . Mass murder is a popular sport . " " I 'd think a good many . That war would have come at the right moment for me . But , maybe , I can get to Spain , anyway . " When Craig smiled , even moodily , Asa could understand why first Stanley and then Roy had felt his queer magnetism . Not a normal attraction , yet , in some odd way , compelling . Was it because he seemed to express the two opposite extremes of his age : the restless discontent and the hopeless search for perfection ? Intense but shallow , Asa said to himself , for it appeared to him , in the cool wisdom of middle-age , that modern youth had no passion ; that it had only passions . . . " Did you ever wonder , " Craig was still rambling on , " why we ca n't have the sort of life that we 're fitted for ? " " Is n't that because we only imagine we 're fitted for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never had it ? " " Maybe you 're right , but  --  oh , well , what do we know of ourselves anyway ? " Craig bent his head sideways , listening with an abstracted expression , while a door upstairs openedp237and shut , and Roy 's voice was heard answering her mother . " What do we really know about anything ? " he asked impatiently , and from his look , from his tone , he might have been speaking across an unconquerable isolation . " If we do n't understand ourselves , how can we expect to understandother people ? Take men and women , for instance . How on earth . . . " There was a sound of running feet , and Roy came in , wearing a small brown hat with a speckled cock 's feather perched jauntily on one side . " I wonder if he can be falling in love all over again ? " Asa asked himself . Craig rose and held out his hand . " I 've wanted to see you , Mr. Timberlake . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm not down at the factory . " Following them to the door , Asa called cheerfully , " Do n't stay too late , and take good care of her , Craig . " As the car started off , he stood in the doorway looking wistfully after it . The sunlight was a flying spray in the wind , and while he breathed in long draughts of air , he watched the sweeping gray and black wings of the pigeons . Suddenly the leaves parted overhead , and a ray of sunshine flashed into his face and lit up the cool ironic gleam in his eyes . On the edge of darkness an unapprehended thought , barely more than a mist of sensation , wavered and vanished and wavered again . Am I here or there ? he wondered . Can a man have two separate selves ? Can he be in two different places at the same time ? What does it mean anyway ? Or does it mean nothing ? I am standing here , in this doorway , in this street , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more real part , is miles away with Kate , following the river path , where meadow-larks are skimming over the life-ever-lasting . But this is solid , he thought , this is real ; and the other is only an image in the mind , a figment of unsatisfiedlonging . Still , who knows what is real ? Matter is solid , but it can be broken in two ; it can be burned into ashes . He had merely to separate his dual life , dividing the life of circumstance from the life which he knew as his own , and his whole relation to the universe shifted and altered . The strong man within and the average man without , he felt , standing there in this one moment , in this autumn brightness , were not different aspects of a single personality ; they were two detached and unrelated identities . . . . Then the beam of sunlight flashed on ; the leaves fell together across the margin of blue ; the instant of illumination faded and died . He was still what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ever known his own country , an atom without a universe . And the others ? Were they any happier than he , except for that perilous youth , which escaped from their grasp even while they were trying in its name to conquerthe world ? What of Craig , who wanted to reform a whole social system , but could not keep a rein over his own instincts ? What of Roy , who was capable of greatness , and craved only the second best ? If he were out of step with his time , so , he told himself , were the others ; they also were apart from today and would be left behind by tomorrow , The wind stirred the branches ; drops of sunlight sprinkled his face ; the flicker of amusement shone again in his eyes . Everything at which he looked , the street , the houses , the film of golden dust , everything was faintly colored by the smoky blue haze of October . . . . A bicycle wheeled round the corner , and the pigeons scatteredand rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Asa reached out his hand for the letter , hisp239glance darted to the address on the envelope , and he saw , with a start of uneasiness , that the writing was Stanley 's . But the letter was for Lavinia , and he turned slowly into the house and walked with a dragging step up the staircase . Lavinia was still in bed , and her untouched breakfast tray was in front of her . When he gave her the letter , she opened it eagerly , and then waited to put on her spectacles before she began to read . " I hope nothing has happened . I hope she ca n't be going to have a baby . " She unfolded the sheets of paper and bent over the sprawling and blotted lines . " No , it is n't that , thank Heaven . But she is unhappy . Oh , Asa , she says she is very unhappy ! " " Well , anyway , she 's had what she wanted . " Lavinia dropped the letter and pushed it toward him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asa . " " I 'll remember . " " No matter what she has done , she is still our child . " " That may be the trouble . " He looked up from the page he was reading . " Well , anything would be better than what you feared . It strikes me that the offspring of Stanley and Peter would have the devil to pay . " Lavinia sighed and fell back on her pillows , while he went over to the window and read the letter by the pale golden light that sifted in through the maples . " Mother darling : " I am so unhappy that I simply must talk to somebody , and you are the only person , except Uncle William , who has ever really and truly understood me . For the last few days I have cried all the time . Even when I am driving by myself out of town ( there is not anything for me to do but drive by myself ) I can feel the tears rolling down my cheeks , and I know people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funeral . " But , oh , Mother , if you could only know what I have had to put up with since I came away . Not having any money is the worst , but it is just a part of what I have been through . At first , I was so madly in love with Peter that I seemed to be living in a dream and was driven by something that was too strong for me . If you have never been in love that way , you can not imagine what it is like or how terribly it can hurt . I felt that Peter and I were made for each other , and he felt so too  --  at least in the first few months  --  before Roy set him free , and we were married and knew we 'd have to be together for all the rest of our lives . In the beginning , Peter could not bear to be a minute away from me , but we were no sooner married than we started having the most dreadful quarrels . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that I had the sweetest disposition of any of your children ? But I never dreamed that Peter 's temper could be so violent . He flies into a rage over the simplest thing , and I can not do or say anything without upsetting his nerves . Heaven knows , I have tried hard enough . I have even bitten my tongue trying not to answer back when he begins to storm at me . But nothing does any good . It is just plain temper with him . He does not seem able to get on with anybody , and he is always in a scrap with some of the doctorsat the hospital . I know that , because when I broke down and told Dr. Blaford about it , he said I ought to make Peter have himself thoroughly gone over and checked up  --  that something was wrong somewhere . But I told Peter this , and it made him perfectly furious . He pretended I was trying to get rid of him . After all I have given up for him , he seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of my leav- " Stanley ought to have thought of that sooner . " " I blame him far more than I do her , Asa . She is young and helpless . " " She 's young , but I 'm not so sure that she 's helpless . And I do n't care whom you blame , or how many . " " I 'm trying to make you fair to her , Asa . " " Fair to her ? I tell you I 'm afraid of her . I 'm afraid of her making me unfair to other people . Oh , it is n't her fault , I know , but she was born to make trouble . I sometimes think she has no real existence apart from her effect upon other people . Look at the way William goes flabby whenever she cuddles up to him . . . . And if you want to know the truth , I could n't stand up against her myself -- not with that face , not with that injured innocence . " Instead of stopping her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful direction . " Do you mind my showing her letter to Uncle William ? " " It 's your letter . You may show it to anybody you please but Roy . Now , if you do n't want to miss your sermon , you 'd better get started and turn on the radio . "   WHERE shall we go ? " Craig asked , without looking round , and Roy answered , " Anywhere , anywhere that is away . " Away from people , away from the present , away from having or not having , away from wanting or not wanting . She gazed eagerly beyond the white streak of road into the shimmering distance . " Anywhere , " she repeated . " I could go on forever . " " It is a kind of escape . " He slowed down and smiled at her , with the wind blowing through his hair and his eyes wistful and dreamy . " An escape from what ? " " From ourselves , from our lives . Out of everywhere into nowhere . " " Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't thought . " " But that 's what I want . Something I 've never had , something I 've never known . " Her eyes sparkled ; there was a dark flush in her cheeks . " Something . . . " he began , and stopped , with his gaze fixed on the road ahead . Watching his sharp , thin profile , which looked , in the brilliant light , a little unearthly , she said to herself : Yes , he is interesting up to a point , but what is there beyond ? When that point is reached , would one find nothing or everything ? But is it always like that with people ? she wondered . Must one go on forever experimenting and failing , seeking and missing , finding and losing ? Was it a perpetual beginningagain whenever one came to the end ? I want certainty , she thought , but most of all , I want love . Some womenP245may live without love , but I can not . When love goes , I slip down again into emptiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she asked herself : Is he really here ? Is he something to hold by ? Or when the wheel comes up again , will he also turn to mist and evaporate ? She had been hurt once too deeply ; the wound was not healed ; but some day the memory would drop back into the past . I have forgotten , she forced herself to say over and over . I am making a new life . A hot vapor stung her eyelids ; there was the taste of salt on her lips ; her throat ached with the hard strain of forgetting . Suddenly , as if by a blow , she saw through her tears , the autumnlandscape tossed apart and together . I hate you , Peter , she thought . Oh , how I hate you ! The car came to a stop , and Craig leaned toward her and touched the hand on her knee , the hand that had felt the nearness of Peter . " Happy , Roy ? " But he knew . He knew as well as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It had begun as a valiant pretense , this will toward happiness , and then , as the months had gone by , the resolve had seemed to impress itself not only upon their own minds , but even upon circumstances . By repeating that they were happy , they had been able to create the semblance of happiness . Still looking at her intently , he lifted her hand and pressed it against his cheek . " Is there anything better than this freedomand this friendship ? " She smiled at him , without answering in words . The strain was eased in her throat , the hot mist had melted away from her eyelids . It was more than comfort that she felt ; it was a kind of still happiness , a sense of reconciliation  --  but with what ? If only it would last ! If only the moment would not spin on as soon as it had fulfilled itself ! She liked the warm touch of his hand on hers . For an instant , she felt a thrill of emotion , faint and breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm that was over . Then the quiver passed ; the response faded . Is it real ? she asked herself . Whether it is real or not , it is better than loneliness . " You mean a lot to me , Roy , " he said . " You know that . " Had he read her thoughts ? She flushed and turned her eyes away from him . " We both needed to talk , " she replied slowly . " I suppose we did need each other . " " God knows we have talked ! But it means more than just talking . " " Well , it helped you . " " And you ? " " Oh , yes , " she replied lightly . " I enjoy the sound of my own voice . " " Do n't be bitter . You are n't bitter , are you ? " " I do n't know . Father thinks I am . But I 'm not bitter about you . " " Or about anybody . We 've stopped all that . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're there , and there 's nothing to be done about them . " " I know . We 've said all that a hundred times . " " Well , we mean it . We 're going ahead with our lives and our work . Nobody can stop us . " She nodded , thinking of that August afternoon in Jefferson Park . Had he really forgotten his despair and defeat ? " You 've helped me a lot , " he repeated , and fumbled vainly for a new way of saying it . " If it had n't been for you , I could n't have come through the last months . I could n't have got on my feet again . " So he remembered . He had thrust the past aside , but it was only dead ; it was not buried.  | " Nobody could look at you and not want to stand up and face what is coming . " " You do n't have to say it . " " But I want to . I want to tell you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , Craig , " she said brightly . " I mean that . You 're as right as can be . " " That 's where you come in , my dear . " " Well , I 'm glad , though I 'm Daddy 's daughter , and I suppose a bit skeptical . " " You 're fine , Roy , and so is your father . He may be a misfit like me , but he knows his way a long sight better than does that colossal boob , your Uncle William . " " Uncle William is good to us , in his way . " " Because he gives you a scrap of his millions . And how did he make them ? " She laughed . " I should n't know if you told me . But he 's a grand old gentleman . " " So I 've heard . " His mouth twisted into a wry smile . " He 's also the last great captain of industry . " " I do n't care . " She tossed her head defiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then ca n't you see what I 'm trying to do ? Ca n't you see , Roy ? I am trying to make , or help to make , a world in which men like your father will no longer be at the mercy of men like your Uncle William . " " I do . I can  --  " Then , suddenly , the shadow of a thought darkened her steady gaze . " But men will never make a world in which women like me will no longer be at the mercy of women like  --  well , like Stanley . " Silence , cold and heavy as a stone , dropped between them . Why , oh , why had she said that ? she asked herself , glancing round at the quivering sunshine and the autumn haze over the meadows . Yet the outburst had brought with it a sharp sense of release . Some pressure within was overcome , and she felt strong and defiant . For an instant , while he looked away from her , he did not speak . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep tenderness in his eyes . " I know , " he answered gently . " I know , my dear . " As she smiled up at him , she felt , with a kind of shock , that the moment of complete sympathy was almost too intenseto be borne . Two living forces , she felt , the past and the present , were fighting together . But it is only pity or passion , she told herself , and I despise both pity and passion . He straightened himself abruptly and put his hand on the wheel , though the car did not start . " It was your Uncle William 's advice , " he said casually , " that started me on my downward road . He noticed that I was beginning to shoot away from the type , so he advised my father to improve my manners by sending me to the University of Virginia , and to improve my mind by sending me to Harvard . You see , my family was a clinging vine on tradition , and when tradition rots away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle William despises tradition . " " The devil he does ! Not when he can make anything out . of it . Forty years ago he began buying worn-out estates and selling them , for five times their value , to Westerners who wanted family graveyards . " She tossed the subject aside . " I wonder why you stayed on in Queenborough . " " I 'm blessed if I know ! My father says I 'm bone lazy . Anyway , I 'm always meaning to do things and never getting through with them . " The car sped on , and he continued ,  |p249after  a pause , without turning his head . " When I was at Harvard I had a first-rate offer from a firm in New York ; but I was fed up on corporation law , and I suppose I was beginning to feel tough . Then Charley Appleby got an idea that we might as well go in together on Main Street . Our only reason , if we had one , was that we were free to follow our noses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sours . " " You never told me this before . " " Did n't I ? Well , it was n't worth telling . There 's been so much else we wanted to say . There 's the war in Spain . . . I always meant to get into that war sooner or later . . . " " I wish , " she sighed wistfully , " that there were a war in Spain for me . " " There used to be castles in Spain . " " There are no castles left , now . But I 'd be satisfied with a cottage if only  --  " " I thought you were all right here . " " Oh , I am . I 'm all right . " " How is the shop ? " " Fine . We are decorating the new Crenshaw place , in Hampton Gardens . " " You like working ? " " I do n't know . It fills my life from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon . That 's the best part of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , folded range on range against the dim blue horizon . Far ahead , the mountainswere russet with sunshine or purple with the slowly drifting shadows of clouds . Here and there , as they climbed higher , friendly villages dotted the valleys or nestled in a deep cleft of the Blue Ridge . There was the tang of frost in the air , the roadsides were gay with asters and golden-rod ,  | and now and then a scarlet or wine-colored branch arched out of the forest . " It 's one o'clock , " he said . " We 'd better have lunch in Lexington . " " No , I 'd rather stop over there , at that little road-house with the big willows . " " Is it too cold out of doors ? There 's a table under the willows . " He turned out of the road and stopped in front of a conspicuous service station dwarfing an inconspicuous restaurant . " No , it 's warm in the sunshine . We 've followed the sum-mer . " When they strolled over to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tawny hair , came out of the house and spread a checked blue and white cloth over the table . " The season 's mostly over now , " he explained , " but a big tourist party about cleaned us up an Roy ? " " If it means coffee and bread and butter . Valley coffee is good . " " Yes 'm , I can give you coffee , " replied the long-limbed man , " and I 've got w ( nder bread and fresh butter that 's just come out of Mrs. Moore 's churn . She still churns twice a week . " " What about an egg ? " asked Craig . " Not an egg left , sir . I was n't counting on so many tourists , and I did n't lay in enough eggs and bacon to tide over the week-end . I 've got some sandwiches of store ham , but they were made day before yesterday . " " No , no store ham . You 'd better be putting on the coffee and slicing the wonder bread  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow mountain stride , " to bring plenty of butter . " As the man disappeared into the kitchen , they sat down in splint-bottomed chairs and smiled at each other over the coarse checked cloth . The pate boughs of the willows , almost . bare of leaves , hung motionless over their heads . Around them the landscape was enclosed in a faintly tar nished frame of autumn . The rusty gold of the sycamores , hickories , and poplars still clung to the branches ; the maples were like a dying flame in the woods ; the russet and crimson leaves of the oaks would not fall until the first snow , and a few clusters would linger on until the earliest foretaste of spring . While she waited there , in a soundless whisper of time , it seemed to Roy that all the murmurous echo of life had paused . October waited ; the passing clouds waited ; and even the earth appeared to wait , as if it were slowly spinningdown in a universe which also waited in vain . Only on a near hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in a cascade of foam , splashing , sparkling , rippling , singing on its way , did the stillness seem to breathe and awaken from immobility . The door of the house opened and shut , and presently the aroma of coffee floated across the bright grass and the fallen leaves . Craig collected himself with a jerk , and she watched him lift his hand to brush the rumpled hair back from his forehead . It was a nice hand , she found herself thinking , with golden brown freckles on the back and thin , sensitive fingers . " Smells as if it were all right , " he said happily . " Are you hungry ? " " Are n't you ? "  | " Starving . " " Are you glad you came ? " " What do you think ? " " I 'm not thinking . I hate to think when everything is so  --  well , so exactly right . Let 's take it as it is , and not worry . " While his gaze held her , she was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was pushing with all her strength against life , that she was sunk in the hollow of a wave which would presently break over her . Then , in a single instant , the wave had receded , and she was floating at ease on a level tide . The strain , too , the hard thrusts , the constant pressure , had ended . She could remember , now , without that tight ache in her throat . " Here 's the coffee , " Craig said , and his laugh was lightheartedand boyish . Then , as the man put down a red tin tray on the table , and neatly arranged the coffee-pot and the loaf of bread and pat of butter , Craig became casual and friendly . He had a pleasant way with strangers , and an inveterate curiosity about the world . In a few minutes , talkingat random , he had drawn out the major events in the man 's life , as well as his views on the political outlook and the danger of foreign entanglements . The only flaw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was that he appeared to be equally without effort and without discrimination . She had seen him scowl on serious occasions , and again , when there was nothing to be won or lost by amenities , he would set out whimsically , she told herself , to charm the very birds from the trees . Today , he was at his best , and she wondered idly whether the contradiction in his features gave him that air of mystery and vagueness . He 's lovable , she thought ; almost any woman might fall in love with him . " How do you make out here ? " he was asking with un/assumed interest . " You 've a view all right . There 's your choice between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies . But what about the land ? Do you manage to do any farming ? " While he poured out the coffee , and they sat drinking it from heavy cups , the man answered Craig 's questions , and pointed out his small hill farm in the distance . " That 's my place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my great-grandfather ; and his father fought in the Indian wars and the Revolution . Yes , sir , we 're Valley folk , and we 've always made a fair sort of living out of the land . But now , with taxes so high , ready money ai n't easy to come by , and it 's hard to scrape up enough to raise our crops . That 's why I started this filling station , and then , when folks began wantinga bite to eat , we thought we 'd try our hand at an eating place . Mighty few tourists want to pay the high hotel prices , and in summer we ca n't find near enough tables to seat ' em .... " A car went by in the road , then slowed down and backed up , sounding a horn as it approached . " Somebody needs gas . " The man broke off abruptly , and turning away , hurriedover the stretch of grass and weeds to the red pumps in front of the service station . " I like that chap , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is n't half bad , is it ? But it 's funny using condensed milk in the country . " " The butter 's fresh , anyway . I suppose the tourists got all the other milk . But do you suppose he 'd rather have a view than a cow ? " " I doubt if he 's ever looked at the view . I never knew a mountaineer who wanted to look at a mountain , except when he was down in the low country . " " You 're always so interested in people , " she said sym/pathetically , " as long , of course , as they do n't belong to your own circle . " He shook his head . " I have n't any circle , and if I had , I 'd do my best to break away from it . By the way , I meant to tell you I 'd had a talk with that colored boy , Parry Clay , while he was washing my car . There 's good stuff in that boy . " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to his mother , and she was my mammy . " " It does n't matter , because I 'm going to see that he gets a chance . If it 's my one good deed , I 'm going to see Parry through college , and after that , if he still keeps ahead , to Howard University . " " Can you afford it , Craig ? " " Oh , I can afford it . I can always afford what I want . " " I know what that means . You 'll go without something else that you do n't want . " " Well , that does n't do any harm . Have you noticed that we 've eaten the whole loaf and emptied the coffee-pot ? Are you ready for more ? " " I 'd rather stop again , farther on . " They left the table and walked slowly down the hill to a stream fringed by willows . The narrow valley was radiant with the leaves on the trees , the leaves in the air , the leaves on the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but bright wedges of sunshine were driven into the shallow loop of the hills . A thought flashed through her mind and was gone . If only it would n't end ! If only I never had to go back ! " What are you thinking ? " he asked . " There was a shadow over your face . "  | " I was wishing that things could last . I do n't want to go back . " " I was wishing that too . " " But it ca n't last . Has anything ever lasted ? " " It might , " he answered thoughtfully , " if we tried to make it  --  if we could follow the moment . " " I wonder . . . " she began and felt again that vague stir of expectancy . " If we were really sensible , " he burst out , " do you know what we 'd do ? " She did not speak , and his words came in a breathless rush , as if he were driven by some blind motive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives in hand and make them do what we want . We need each other  --  we 're happy together . " She smiled at him , but her smile wavered . " Yes , we 're happy . " " Then why ca n't we act like rational creatures ? Why do we turn and go back to unhappiness ? " " Because it will go on in spite of us or anything that we do . I mean the unhappiness . . . . " " But it need n't go on for us . What we ought to do is to keep straight ahead . I can find a road that will take us to Washington , and we could . stay there , or somewhere else , until we can be married . For once in our lives , why ca n't we do something that 's decisive  --  that 's final ? " She looked at him gravely , neither consenting nor refusing , while the faint quiver of longing ( was it joy ? was it fear ? ) awoke in her nerves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or was it merely excitement ? " But it is n't real , Craig , " she said presently . " You want it , and so do I , but it is n't real . You 're trying again to retreatfrom life as it is. "  | " We could make it real . What does anything matter as long as we 're happy together ? We have everything we need . " That was true , she assented . They had everything but the one thing that she and Peter had found and lost . And that one thing alone made the whole world of difference . " No , it is n't real . " She frowned , and a scornful little laugh turned into a sob . " You 're asking me to run away with you before you 've even told me you cared . " " But I do care . I love you . You know that . And , besides , " he added furiously , " I want the kind of love that gives security . " She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security in love . When security comes in , love changes to loving-kindness . " " Well , I want that . Oh , Roy , I want you ! I want you to save me from myself . " " Nobody can save any one else . " God knows , she thought , I 've learned that much . " Do n't you want to come away with me , Roy ? " A moment slipped by before she answered . . . " I want love . I need love so desperately that I suppose I 'll always miss it . But I want it real . I hate shams . Oh , how I hate shams ! " " This is n't a sham . It is real . " She laughed again . " As far as it goes . " " It will go as far as we let it . Are n't you coming ? Why do we always spoil things by trying to reason them out ? Why do we cheat ourselves by putting off , and hanging back from , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? " " You know there is . " Oh , yes , she knew , she knew , her heart told her.  | " This is our chance to break away , and to start over again , from the beginning . " " But we might not find what we 're looking for . " " That would depend on us . At least there would be pro-tection . " " In marriage ? " Her eyes were wide and stormy with pain . " In our marriage , " he answered . Looking away from him , her troubled gaze came to rest on the drifting shadows of clouds . She had believed , too , when she was married to Peter , that there would be protectionin marriage . Less than three years ago , she had believed that ; and today she stood stripped , not only of her faith in love 's permanence , but of every other romantic illusion . Nothing , not even the inner structure of life , could ever become again what it had been then . When she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips were still trembling . " You 're a dear , Craig , " she said , " but I 'm selfish . I 'm not satisfied with security . I want happiness . " " Well , we 'll find it . We can find anything if we 're together . God knows it would be easy to love you . " " You want to love me , I know . But when you love me too much to want to love me , I may be willing to go with you to Washington  --  or anywhere else . " " Then it 's settled . If it ca n't be today , it will be tomorrow . Let 's make it Christmas or the New Year . " " No , not then . We 're going to leave happiness free . " " Well , what about April ? " " No , not April ! never , never , April again ! " It seemed a dream now , that other marriage in April . She remembered the faces in church , the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle ; but not the look in Peter 's eyes ,  |p258not  the luminous joy in her heart . " If we care enough when summer comes , " she said slowly , " then I 'll marry you . " He kissed her quickly . " Wait and see , darling . You 'll make a man of me yet . " She smiled brightly . " I 'm a substitute for war , anyway . " It was a mercy , she told herself , that she was still able to laugh , and even to find life amusing . In a little while , the past would be over , for good and all ; even as a bitter memory , it would be over , and she could begin to be happy.  | THE winter was mild , with snowdrops and crocusesblooming in January ; but , throughout Februaryand March , light flurries of snow came spinning out of the north . Swift , silent , dissolving , the flakes whirled down and vanished as soon as they touched earth . From the window of the living-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were made out of swan'sdown . In the white stillness , through the hurrying snowflakes , the street and the bared branches of trees and the solid fronts of the houses appeared as fugitive as shapes that float between waking and sleeping . Only when a horn tooted , and the lights of a car crashed through the pallid dusk , did the scene and the March afternoon wear a look of reality . Time is like that , she thought ; time drifts over us and obliterates everything we have been , everything we have known . And we go on repeating ourselves ; after a war to end war , we are now talking of war again . Only last summer she had felt that she was bound to the past , that she could never forget . Yet her will had been stronger than memory , and she had thrust out of her life the old unhappiness . Her days were peaceful now ; so were the long nights . It was easier to command her thoughts , and she had lost the panic terror of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden awakening , alone in a black and unreal universe , at the stroke of three ; without , too , that desperate and despairing search , through this unreal black universe , for something precious which she had lost and could never recover . It was even possible to speak of Peter , or to hear his name mentioned , and not to feel again that violent shudderof recollection , that swift upward springing and down- ward sinking which was , and yet was not , the hunger of passion . At such moments , it seemed , her heart would unguardedly open above a secret well of bitterness , and then close , in a despairing quiet , over the shaken depths . All that was now ended . She had fought and won ; and she knew that it was not her own strength alone , it was partly Craig , who had saved her . What she had felt , with a single flash of penetration , on that August afternoon , was a fundamental truth of emotion . It takes love , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ; jealousy does not end it ; even hatred does not kill love . Only another love can destroy love utterly . There were fleeting instants still when impulse would slip control , and a satirical voice in her mind ask : Did you love love , or did you love Peter ? Is Craig merely a different image that love wears ? Is love immortal , and does only the object of love change and vary ? This year you love Craig , and last year you loved Peter ; yet the love was different . Never again , she knew , could she feel the first springtime ecstasy of the heart . That was over forever . First love could come but once , in a single way . It might change , but it was powerless to repeat itself . I loved Peter , she thought , because I needed him with my whole nature . I love Craig only because he has need of me . I love love because in the world we know it is the only reality left . A man came through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed first to be merely a fantastic shape , as unreal as the shrouded outlines of branches . Then he pushed aside the moving veil , and she saw that it was her father , with his head slightly bowed and his hat drawn down to keep the flakes out of his eyes . One of his hands , which clutched a folded newspaper , was holding tight to the front of his overcoat . Something pathetic and forlorn in hisp261stooped figure , some touch of loneliness in his walk , brought into her young eyes a film of tears . He needs a new overcoat , she said to herself , and then : But he never buys anything for himself . I wonder whether he really minds going shabby ? He mounted the steps ; she heard the front door open and shut , and then the sound of a chair pushed aside as he stopped to take off his overshoes . A minute later he entered the room , shivering a little , and slapping his reddened hands . " A fire would look cheerful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires in the old house ? " " I was just wishing that we could afford them here . " " If we could , where would we put them ? Not in that imitationfireplace . " " You look so cold and tired , Daddy . Let me get you a drink . " " There is n't any whisky . That 's a luxury I 've done with-out . " " Craig left a bottle , in case we needed it . " " We got on very well without it  --  at least my father and mother did . " " They did n't live at this time . " " Yet we , too , had our troubles . " Nearly fifty years ago ! Again he heard that old shot under the willow , and he felt an icy hand clutch at his heart . " Anyway , it 's different with us . We ca n't stand up withoutsomething to brace us . At least , people like Craig ca n't . " " He is n't nearly so jittery as he used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . " " I think I have helped . He is the kind of person who has to be helped . " " That means a great deal . And now , I 'd better go down and have a poke at the furnace . "  | " Oh , Daddy , ca n't you ever stop thinking about the furnace ? " " Somebody has to think about it , Roy . It wo n't take more than a minute . " As he turned quickly , a red hot twinge of pain shot through his left leg , and he stood . waiting while the hurt gradually eased away . If my legs go back on me , he thought , I do n't know what will become of us all . Roy was already in the dining-room mixing his highball ; and he stifled the groan on his lips as he limped slowly into the kitchen and then down the dim steps to the furnace room . The cellar smelt stuffy and musty and curiously depressing . When he had filled a scuttle with run-of-the-mine coal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully packed the furnace , he found himself wondering how on earth he could manage if his legs actually went back on him . As long as I can get about , he thought , remembering his father , I can keep going . In the kitchen Virgie sat composedly peeling potatoes . " The house was getting chilly , Virgie , " he said . She gazed at him placidly , with a knife poised in one hand and with a half-peeled potato in the other . " Yas , suh , I reckon hit wuz . " " Had n't you noticed it ? " " Naw , suh , I ain ' felt nuttin ' . I'se jes ' been settin ' here , right close up ter de range . " She finished the potato and observed , conversationally , as she tossed it into the pot , " You certny do take on ovah dat ole furnace , Mr. Asa . I wonder hit do n't wear you out . " " It does , Virgie . I 'm quite worn out this minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lay down and res ' yo'sef befo ' dinner ? "  | " It 's just my legs , Virgie . I 've always depended on my legs to see me through , and now they 're giving out . " " Naw , dey ai n't , suh . I know whut I'se talkin ' about , an ' all yo ' laigs need is fuh you ter lay off'n urn . " " I should n't wonder . But has everything been all right today ? " " I ain ' sayin ' dat , not ef'n you ax me , suh . Miss Lavinny , she 's been moughty complainin ' , but de times dey is er heap quieter den dey use'n ter be when Miss Stanley an ' Mr. Peter wuz wid us . " " Well , I 'll go up and rest . I have a kind of gone feeling inside . " " Dat 's yo ' stomick cryin ' out , suh , an ' I 'll hurry up jes ' ez quick ez I kin . Mr. Craig said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he knows I'se good an ' ready . Miss Lavinny bought an ole hen ovah de ' phone dis mawnin ' , but she 's jes ' as tough an ' stringy as even she wuz an ole rooster . " In the living-room Roy gave him his highball , and while he sipped it slowly and nibbled at a biscuit , an agreeable warmth began to stir in his hands and feet . I had no idea I was so chilled , he said to himself , and continued aloud : " The heat will come up in a few minutes . It had got very low , and Virgie was busy about dinner . " Roy brought a coat from the hall and spread it over his knees . " Take a bit more , Daddy , " she begged . " You look less blue already . " " Yes , I needed it . " Resting his head against the high back of the chair , he looked at her through a pleasant haze . " Warm now ? " she asked , and he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roy-had switched on all the lamps , and the shaded glare made a pool of brightness against the winter scene in thep264street . Snow was still falling ; the trees and houses were mantled ; but now and then the glimmer of a passing car , like the frozen wings of a giant moth , flitted under the pallid boughs . " I hope it wo n't last , " Roy said , glancing out of the window . " I hope we sha n't have to pay a man to clear it away . " " No , it will be gone by tomorrow . Had n't I better go upstairs , now , to your mother ? " " Wait a while . She does n't need anything as much as you need a rest . Aunt Charlotte has given her a bigger electric pad , so she does n't complain of the cold . " " Have you talked with her since you came in ? " " For a few minutes . But I could n't stay . I can not , " Roy said firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Has she begun again ? " " She has never left off . " " I suppose it eases her mind . " " I do n't care . I wo n't listen . No matter what she says , I will not listen to anything about Stanley . " Her face flushed , and an angry gleam shone in her eyes . " What is over , is over . Stanley and  --  and Peter have gone out of my affairs for good . " " You 're right , my child , " he replied , putting down his glass and sitting erect in his chair . " You were never more right in your life . " " Can anybody stop Mother ? " " I doubt that . But we can shut it out . You must stop your ears when she talks . " " She will ask me questions . Ca n't I forgive Stanley ? Ca n't I see how she 's suffered ? Wo n't I remember that she 's my sister ? No , I have n't forgiven her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not remember that she 's my sister . . . "  | " That 's natural , daughter , I know . But your mother is not herself . She 's an ill woman . She 's ill both in mind and body . " " Is she really so ill ? I mean , really . . . " " In her nerves she is . It may be partly imagination , but it 's what life has done to her  --  and to the rest of us . She has never had anything she wanted . She has never done anything she wanted to do . " " But why not ? Why did n't she try ? " " She could n't in the world she lived in . The system was not right for her . She ought to have been a man , and she was n't even a successful woman . She was n't pretty as a girl . She lacked charm . She was n't feminine . She made no ap-peal . " " Yet you fell in love with her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or . . . " He broke off , because  it was impossible to go on . He could not confess , to Lavinia 's daughter , that he had never been in love with her mother  --  that no man had ever really wanted Lavinia . " You are far better off nowadays . You may think you 've never had a break , but you 're better off than your mother was . " " I hate , " Roy said bitterly , " to have to live in a man 's world . " He shook his head . " It is n't always so easy on men . There 's your mother 's lot , and there 's mine . But , after all , you have n't a choice , my child . There is n't any other world unless  --  unless you think Stanley 's world better . " " That 's still a man 's world . Is n't she what men want her to be ? " " Not always , my dear . Now that you 're happy again , ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow under the trees he thought at random : Is family life at the bottom of all our troubles ? And is there anything better we could put in its place ? He felt her gaze on him , and he turned his eyes from the window . She looked older , he told himself ; the contour of her features had lost the blurred softness of youth ; but her face was more charming , more eloquent , than it had ever been . After all , he reasoned , there is much to be said for intelligencein a woman , especially when experience has fined down romantic exuberance . She was wearing her hair in a new way , with a single deep wave brushed back from her forehead and the short curls falling over her ears . He was not sure that he liked it so well , but it served to define the clear curve of her eyebrows over her steady gaze . She was not beautiful , he knew , when compared with Stanley . Roy 's nose was blunt at the tip ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of her milk-white teeth should have been straightened when she was little . But he had never seen a face , he said to himself , that he liked better . There was a charm in her sudden smile , in her youthful blunt profile , and even in the tiny scar , like a dimple , at the corner of her red mouth . She looks brave , he thought , and she looks honest . A man might safely trust his happiness in her hands . " What were you thinking , Daddy ? " " I was thinking that I 'd never seen a face I liked better . " " What , this old face ? I 've had it forever . " How he loved to hear the unforced gaiety of her laugh ! " I hope Craig is good enough for you , Roy . He told me you 'd promised to marry him in the summer . " " It 's a long , long way to summer , darling . " " If you 're happy . . . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of happiness . " Shep267smiled and then frowned . " But I 'd rather not hurry . I want to wait till fall . " " Be very sure , daughter , this time . " " I was sure last time , old dear . I was entirely too sure . " There was a ring at the bell , and Roy ran eagerly to let Craig in out of the cold . With the opening door , it seemed to Asa that the driven snow invaded the house . Then the door slammed ; there was the sound of cheerful voices , while Craig pulled off his overcoat ; and , an instant later , he came with Roy into the living-room . " I was afraid we were going to have sleet , " he said , " but it 's melting already . " " I 'm glad of that . " Asa stiffened , with the absurd embarrassmenthe always felt in the presence of lovers . " I 'd better be going upstairs . Your mother will be wanting her digitalis . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or let me , " Craig said , with the genial readiness which in any situation was one of his most endearing traits . " Mrs. Timberlake has a weakness for me . I know , " he added gaily , " because she told me so . " " Well , you ca n't believe everything a womanly woman tells you . " Though Asa 's tone was whimsical , he was asking himself whether young people who were really in love could be so casual with each other . Had love also changed ? Or was it only romance that was missing ? But how , he demanded in weary perplexity , how could love exist without romance or romance without love ? Even when they were alone , he could still hear the sound of unconcerned chaffing ; but from the bantering note he could not decide whether they called each other " darling " or " old thing . " They seemed to regard the two terms as equally intimate or irrelevant . Was it all simply a part , he wondered the next instant , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did it spring from somep268inherent distrust , not only of individual significance , but even of man 's place in the universe ? For it was all like that , he admitted , the intransigent youth of the present . Peter and Roy , Craig and Stanley , had each and all treated one another as if they were careless fellow-travellers , to be picked up and dropped , either by accident or by design , on a very brief journey . Lavinia was waiting for him , with an anxious expression and with her Bible open before her . " I 've been anxious all day , " she said . " It has been so long since I had a letter from Stanley . " " Was n't she always a poor letter writer ? " " In the last few months she has written almost every week . But now three weeks have gone by . " " Well , I should n't worry . She 'll write again when she wants something else . " " That 's what worries me . She did ask for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her only a few of them . " " Maybe you 'll hear tomorrow . " " If I do n't , I 'll call her up . I 've been trying to find her telephone number . She sent it to me in one of her letters . " " We can easily get the apartment-house . Are you ready for your medicine ? " She took the glass from his hand and swallowed the digitaliswith a martyred air . " Has Roy told you when she expectsto be married ? " He shook his head . " Not till summer  --  or perhaps fall . " " She never tells me anything . I asked her , but she would n't tell me . " " Well , she will when she 's made up her mind . " Why was it that he could feel so little sympathy for Lavinia 's afflictions ? Was it because they had lived together too long inp269disharmony ? Or was it that he thought of her now as imprisoned in her own morbid egoism ? Turning on his way to the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'd better tidy up a bit before going down . " Dinner was unusually cheerful . Craig was in one of his lively moods , and Virgie , who was a hard-shelled Baptist but enjoyed a proper joke , was constrained , on several occasions , to seek the pantry and indulge in what she felt to be a ribald sense of humor . While Asa ate his stringy fowl , and gazed thoughtfully over the depressed ferns on the table , he found himself pondering the question of time . Did time actually mean less nowadays than it meant a generation ago ? Virgie was passing the potatoes , and he helped himself absent-mindedly . They were soggy , of course , and he regretted , while he prodded them with his fork , that women had allowed cooking to become a forgotten art . " Have you ever thought of learning to cook , Roy ? " he inquired . " Even the knowledge of a discarded classic may be useful in an emergency . " " Oh , but I hate it , Daddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig ? " " You bet I 'm not , darling . Why worry ? There 's always a restaurant , or at the worst a drug-store , round the corner . " The pudding was served and eaten , or left uneaten , and Virgie , so as to spare herself , she said , had brought the coffee in small cups to the table . Asa had just broken his lump of sugar in half when , in response to two imperative rings at the front door , he put down his cup and hastily pushed back his chair . " That 's your Uncle William 's ring , " he said . " I 'll let him in . You need n't bother , Virgie . " When he opened the door a wet wind stung his face . Snow was falling again , thick and fast , and the blown white drifts made the whole street look as if it were running away . Williamcame in , brushing the snow from his sleeve . " It 's snowinghard , " he said , " but it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple , not from the cold , Asa saw , but from some inner disturbance , and there were heavy pouches under the small blood-shot eyes . " I 've brought bad news , " William began hurriedly . " Where 's Roy ? I do n't want Roy to hear me . " There was a distant drumming in Asa 's ears . " Then we 'd better go upstairs . Can you tell Lavinia ? " " She 'll have to know . No use trying to put off trouble . Only I 'd look out for Roy . " " Then it is n't about Stanley ? " With a stab of pain , he understood how much Stanley still meant to him . " No , it 's Peter . " They had hurried up the staircase while they spoke , and pausing in front of Lavinia 's door , Asa listened to the hoarse rumble in William 's throat while he panted for breath . " Peter 's shot himself . He shot himself in the head . " " Peter has shot himself ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended like that . Not that virile force , that buoyant energy , all that extraordinary zest for the mere act of living ! " Stone dead when he was found . Stanley found him . " " Where was he ? When did it happen ? " But before William could answer , Lavinia 's anxious voice interruped them . " Is that Uncle William ? What are you whispering about ? " " We 'd better go in , " Asa said . " It will have to be broken to her , and after all , it is n't as if it were Stanley . " " Good God , no , " William snorted , as he shook himself and tramped into the room ,  | WHILE he listened to William 's gruff voice trying to be gentle , Asa reflected , with the idle malice of the unguarded mind , that Lavinia shared one useful quality with the more effervescent African race . Like Virgie , whose flighty temperament was immediately sobered by the sound of grief or the sight of crape , Lavinia would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Asa mused , would be the making of her character . " But Stanley ? What did he say about Stanley ? " she was demanding of William . " He had given her an injection and put her to bed . After she found Peter , she had a collapse , but she was asleep when he telephoned , and a nurse was with her . " " It seems so cruel , " Lavinia said , and then more firmly , " Some one must go to her . Of course we must bring her home . " " I 'll go , " Asa said . " I can catch the night train . " And he thought savagely : It is hell to be poor . I 'll have to borrow the money from William . " I was thinking of that , " William muttered , thrusting his hand into his pocket , " and I can let you have whatever you need for the trip . " " Oh , Uncle William , " Lavinia burst out , seizing his arm as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to turn to , what would become of us ? " " There , there , my dear niece , I 'm glad to do what I can . " " But why did he shoot himself ? What did they say ? " " Nobody knows . Peter had been letting down on his work . Darn temperamental chap , Spanger said , and drinking into the bargain . He imagined they had n't been getting on well , but he knew nothing of that at first hand . Stanley had been nervously run down for months . She was going to have a baby , and , in some way , she managed to bring on a miscarriage . . . " " Oh , my poor child , " Lavinia moaned . " She never told me . What else did he say ? I mean Dr. Spanger . " " He asked me to break the news to Peter 's mother . I stopped there on my way down . John Kingsmill is taking the night train . " " Then he will make all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will make the arrangements . His mother and sister wish Peter to be buried in Cedarwood . " At the mention of Peter 's mother , Lavinia began to weep and Asa choked slightly . Less than a year ago Peter had seemed to him the most living thing in the world . But for an accident of the heart or the nerves , he would still be alive , he might easily have outlived the three of them for the next generation . If the color of Stanley 's eyes had been different , or the curve of her mouth . . . " I ca n't take it in , " Lavinia murmured . " It is so terrible I ca n't believe it has happened . " For Peter , too , had a mother . " Things like that are happening every hour , " William said in a tone of impersonal anger . " Nowadays , if a man ca n't dodge away from trouble , he 'd as soon blow his brains out as not . " He hesitated , remembering Daniel Timberlake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all the fault of this loose modern thinking . " Then , wheeling abruptly , he glared at Asa , who murmured stubbornly , " I do n't know , and I do n't care , but we 've got to do something about Roy . " " What is it , Daddy ? " asked a startled voice at his back ,  |p273and  there was Roy looking expectantly from the hall . " Has anything happened ? " Over her head , Asa could see Craig 's grave features and bright roving eyes . " Come in , my dear . We have had a shock , a very bad shock , " William said . " Lavinia , you 'd better tell her . " Roy turned on him in a flash . " What is it ? I wo n't have anything broken to me . " " Wait , Roy . . . " " Tell me . Oh , tell me . I can never go through the worst again . " Asa pushed William aside and came between the girl and her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw that she was instinctively turning to Craig . " It 's about Peter , darling . He died this afternoon . " She stared at him unbelievingly . " Died ? Do you mean Peter is dead ? " " A few hours ago . A doctor in Baltimore telephoned your Uncle William . " Her incredulous gaze turned from Asa to William . All expression had been suddenly wiped from her face and voice . " But he ca n't be dead , Daddy . Peter could n't be dead . " She looked at Craig , who put his arm round her shoulders . There was no grief in her eyes , no horror even , only a profound incredulity . " Was it an accident ? " Craig asked in a level tone . After a slight rebuff , William was again in command of the situation . This much at least , he implied , could be said for the youth of the present ; it did not ask to be spared the truth of events . " No , it was n't an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? How . . . " Roy frowned at him in amazement . " What are you keeping back ? "  | For an instant William did not reply . His eyes wandered to Lavinia , then to Asa , and from Asa to Craig . Finding no help in them , he answered , with all the softness he could compress into a naturally blustering manner , " They told me he killed himself . " " Killed himself ? But he would n't . Why on earth should he kill himself ? " " Nobody knows , my dear . Nobody will ever know . " " But he would n't , Daddy . He always had what he wanted . Nothing stood in his way . " Still , her voice did not break . The most astonishing thing to Asa was the absence of grief in her face , the graven immobility of her attitude , as if she were not wholly there , as if some vital part of her had detacheditself from her surroundings , from the immediate moment , from the actuality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did it , darling . No one can look into a closed mind . " " He was happy . Was n't he happy , when nothing stood in his way ? " " That , too , we shall never know . " " Then we can never know anything ? " " Not anything of the end . " Suddenly , out of the whispering stillness , Craig spoke almostfiercely . " It may have been wanting too much that killed him . " " But he killed himself . " Her voice was low and frozen and remote . " Daddy says he killed himself . " " It 's the same thing . He tried to kill the wanting in himself . But it 's out of your life , Roy . " Craig held her close in his arms . " Whatever happened , it is not a part of your life . It has nothing to do with us . " " No , oh , no . " Her lips scarcely moved , but she clung top275him as if she were drawing strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . " Watching her , Asa thought : If only we could spare them , our children ! If only we could warn them of the danger in living ! But I loved them , he told himself , and I did the best that I could . Yet his best was not enough to ward off the lightest blow of adversity . " That is the right way to look at this  --  this tragedy , my dear , " William was saying . " You have no reason to reproach yourself . Nothing you could have done or left undone would have prevented what happened . " " That 's the horrible part , Uncle William . We 're so helplessagainst  --  against the things outside ourselves . " William stared at her , as if he were seeing some awful image beyond and above her head . " There 's God ! " he blurted out so violently that the words sounded blasphemous . " But it does n't seem to matter , does it ? " Roy answered indifferently . Her deep unseeing eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard that she moistened them before she was able to speak the thought in her mind . " Where did he  --  where did it happen ? " " In the apartment . Stanley was out . When she carne in and went into the bathroom , she found him . " " At least he might have spared her that ! " Craig exclaimed in a smothered voice . " He was past sparing , " Roy said , and added vehemently , " I 'm sick to death of sparing women ! " " Well , it has nothing to do with us , " Craig repeated firmly . " We 're in a different world from those messed up lives . " " Yes , we are in a different world . " Roy 's head was lifted ,  | her glance was straight and unflinching , her mouth had recoveredits soft outline . Thank God , she loves Craig , Asa told himself . And he thought : Craig is right ; she can take a blow on the chin . As long as she loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give herself , she will be safe . Are all women like that ? he wondered . Is loving more necessary to women than being loved ? Is it only when destiny thwarts them , and the source of being dries up within them , that they become like Lavinia , maladjusted to life ? " Thank Heaven ! " he said aloud . " That makes my mind easier about you . " Roy put her hand on his arm . " Poor Daddy , you are tired out . " For the first time in his life , William glanced at Asa with sympathy . " Perhaps Andrew had better go to Baltimore in your place . " " No , I am going , " Asa answered stubbornly . " She is my child . You do n't mind her coming home , do you , Roy ? " Roy looked at Craig . " We do n't mind , do we ? " she asked . " Not now . " Craig caught her hand and held it against his cheek . " Have n't we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's like a bad dream , " she murmured , " everything that has gone . " That 's fine , " William said heartily . " What you needed , Craig , was a woman like Roy . " " I know it . I suppose I 've always known it if I 'd only stopped to think . " " I hope we 'll all try to forgive and forget . " Lavinia was making an effort to sound cheerful and practical . " We must help poor Stanley to make a fresh start in life . "  | " Perhaps she wo n't want to come home , Mother , " Roy replied . " I 'd never come home in her place . " " But you 're so strong , dear , and Stanley is weak . She has always had to be shielded . " " Anyway , my mind 's easier . " Asa drew a sigh of relief . " I 'll telephone to the station before I pack my bag . " " Telegraph me when to meet you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a plane back . " He took out a bulging pocket-book and handed a thick roll of bank-notes to Asa . " This will see you through , and if Stanley needs more , all you have to do is to send me a wire . " He meant it kindly ; he was sincerely moved ; he would have given more than money , Asa knew , to comfort Stanley . All these merits Asa acknowledged , while he found himself reflecting angrily : Is there any hell worse than poverty ? Yet how many millions of men , wearing the pavements out in their tread , would call his poverty living on easy street ? Later in the night , lying awake in his upper berth on the train , he told himself , with stifled self-reproach , that he had never been sufficiently grateful to William . In spite of his arrogance and his natural parsimony , William could be counted upon to be generous in a left-handed fashion . After all , they had lived under his roof , and how could Lavinia have afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted his money , Asa thought , except for Lavinia and the children . For himself , he would rather have lived improvidently , from day to day , with no care for the future . But marriage had made economic freedom too dangerous . Marriage had not only dwarfed his spirit , it had enslaved him to circumstances . For there is no freedom in human affection . In the first instant that he had preferred another 's good to his own , he had exchanged a brief liberty for a per-278 IN THIS OUR LIFEp278manent responsibility . Not that it mattered . His children were more to him than his individual identity . He would sacrifice both his present and his future for them ; yet he had learned , with a breaking heart , that he could not pro tect them against fate . Time was stronger than all the love and pity of all the living . . . Lights flashed by , weaving a jagged pattern on the dark curtains . He drew the blankets under his chin and tried to sink deeper into an impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , when the spectres of imaginationwould be swallowed up in the horrors of the actuality . How could Stanley make her life over again ? How could any life be made over ? Perhaps he ought not to have come . Perhaps , after all , Andrew would have been better . Though he yearned over her , oppressed by the ancient burden of parenthood , he could think of no word to speak that would bring consolation . Suddenly , out of the darkness , the dread and pain in his thoughts gathered together and were woven into a memory . There was a morning in his early childhood , before his father 's failure and death , when his mother had taken him , for the first time , to a dentist . All he knew of such visits had been pictured in his imagination ; but his inarticulate terror had lived on in some obscure labyrinth of his consciousness . All else he had forgotten . The bare structure of the incident had crumbled away , with the name and face of the dentist and the frightening buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an unknown agony , was still hidden but alive beneath the thickening dust of years . . . In the early dawn the forsaken streets appeared phantasmal . The scene , he thought , might have been created inp279some distraught nightmare which was out of touch with existence . Was it only his fancy or had the whole world gone deranged overnight ? There was barely a sign of life anywhere , not even in the languid figures sweeping trash into piles , or in the grating noises of his taxicab as it jerked over the grayish snow . When he lowered the window and leaned out , the wintry air was as dead as the chill of a vault . Butthis , he assured himself , was n't the truth of things , not this airless cold , this sodden gloom , this stale odor of death . The hour would pass , and the mood with it . A sleepless night , an empty stomach , the dreary dawn , and the ruined aspect of a world that has been used and discarded  --  these things were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The taxicab stopped with a jolt . He stepped out into the dirty snow ; he paid the driver ; he turned and walked , with a mechanical stride , across the slushy pavement to the open door of the apartment-house . A fine old Georgian mansion , he noticed casually , a relic of the lost era of elegance , which had bravely stood its ground in a later age of disorder . Mounting the steps , he paused before a row of bells and speaking tubes , and glanced regretfully up the winding curve of the staircase . There was no lift , and recalling that Stanley 's flat was upstairs , he climbed breathlessly , still grasping his small travelling bag . Whatever he found at the top , he hoped with all his aching nerves that it might includea bath and a shave . All tragedy is painful , he thought , but unshaven tragedy is sardonic . He rang the bell , and after a long wait , the door was opened by a nurse in a crumpled uniform , who received him suspiciously . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . As she drew back , he walked past her into what had once been a double withdrawing-room of formal dignity and classic proportions . His disapproving look swept over the crude modern furniture and the too obvious note of decoration . Then he turned inquiringly to the nurse , who appeared plain and competent and severely professional . " Will you let me see Mrs. Kingsmill ? I am her father . " " She is still asleep . " The nurse glanced down at her wristwatch . " I gave her a second hypodermic at four o'clock . " " How has she stood it ? " Again she glanced at her watch as if seeking reassurance . " Not so well . It was a terrible shock . " " And she was alone ? " " Yes . Oh , yes , that was dreadful . She 's very young , is n't she ? " " She is just twenty . Her birthday was a few weeks ago . " The nurse had reddish hair which she wore in a small tight roll at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and very straight , and her wide , full mouth curved pleasantly when she smiled . She was armored , he decided , in the cool judgment and the ample wisdom of one who has never known , or who has safely finished with , love . But from the stiff way she moved , he suspected that her feet were hurting her . If it is n't one thing , it 's another , he thought , and reflected that uneasy feet are scarcely a laughing matter . " Twenty ? " she was repeating . " Why , she does n't look a day over eighteen . " " She is young for her age . Her mother has always treated her as a baby . " " Well , no wonder . She must be really beautiful when she is happy . Even now , she is lovely . I never saw such a skin . " " Do you think I might see her ? I mean , without waking her . "  | " Oh , she wo n't wake . Not if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light . It was turned on when she found him . " " Not in the bedroom ? " " No , it was in the bathroom , at the end of the hall . The light was the first thing she noticed . She says she ca n't get the glare out of her eyes . It 's queer what a shock can do to you . " " Yes , it 's queer . I 've come to take her home . " " I 'm glad of that . She does n't seem to have anybody here . I mean , of course , anybody that 's kin to her . I came from Virginia myself , so I know what your kin mean to you in sorrow . " " Who has made the arrangements ? " " That 's Dr. Spanger . Dr. Blaford has been down with influenza , but Dr. Spanger , from the hospital , has been like a father to her . Then there 's a Mrs. Wilder , a young marriedwoman , but she 's the gay kind . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear on the train . Not really mourning , but all her hats are so  --  well , foolish looking , and we thought maybe in Queenborough . . . " " Do you feel that it matters ? Nobody thinks of the dead nowadays , not even in Queenborough . " " But a doll 's hat , just a bunch of flowers and a bowknot . That did n't seem quite right to us . " " I suppose not . How has she taken it ? I do n't mean the hat , of course , I mean the  --  the . . . " " Yes , I know . It was awful when I first came on the case , but as soon as Dr. Spanger could get her quieted down , he shut her up in her room while the undertaker came and took the body away . Then he told me that Dr. Kingsmill'e brother was coming on and would take charge of the funeral . . . "  | While he listened to the smooth , monotonous voice , it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then righted itself , in a spasm of nausea . So that was what Peter meant now , nothing more . All his physical magnetism , his vital energy , his dynamic sensuality , had become simply a boxful of refuse to be carted away . " Do you think I might have a wash and a shave before she wakes ? " he asked , stavingoff a threatening impulse to vomit . " Oh , yes , the bathroom 's all right now . Only , I do n't let her go near it . I 'll give her her bath in bed . The doctor will be in again on his way to his office . " Her eyes sought her watch , and she added , " I was just going to put on the percolatorwhen you rang . A cup of coffee will be ready for you by the time you 're dressed . " He picked up his bag and then dropped it again . " May I look in on her for a second ? " he asked a little wistfully . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " She crossed the room noiselessly and opened a door at the far end . " Take a peep then , " she whispered . " You wo n't wake her if you are quiet and do n't let in the light . "  | THERE was in the room a dimness which seemed more a partial shadow than the glimmer of daylight , and at first he saw only the bed , with its coverlet of primrose-colored silk over a child 's figure . How young she is ! he thought , with a catch in his throat ; and how little ! She was lying on her back , as straight and still as an effigy . Her head on the pillow was like the head of a doll , framed in rumpled bronze waves , and when he bent over her , he could see the faint darkness of her lashes on the pallor of her cheeks . A quiver of breath came and went through her lips , and it seemed to him that their petulant droop , of which Lavinia and he had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had become intolerably moving . She had never really grown up , he told himself , a little ashamed of his weakness . Her face was still the face of a sullen and disappointed child , with the dangerous appealof an irresponsible innocence . Without warning , against his reason and his will , he felt that his heart was flooded with pity . He had been angry with her ; he had even told himself that he no longer loved her ; but , at this instant , as she lay defenseless in sleep , he was suffocated by the longingto shield , by the savage and irrational instinct of parenthood . Swept clean by unconsciousness , her expression was as shallow , and as vaguely inscrutable , as a closed flower . He judged her for what she was , vain , selfish , unscrupulous in her motives ; even so , he was ready to give all to protect her from the disaster she had provoked . . . Without glancing at the nurse , he turned away , shut the door softly , and picking up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing.  | As he was finishing his breakfast , the doctor came into the living-room and the nurse discreetly withdrew . From the street below he could hear the discordant sounds of what seemed to him to be another age , another world , another life . " I 'd come to know Kingsmill at the hospital , " Dr. Spangersaid , hurriedly , as he shook hands , " and , I confess , his death appears simply incredible . He was one of the most gifted of our younger men . Not completely adjusted , perhaps , but with a brilliant technique . Until the past few weeks , when I noticed he was drinking too heavily , his work in the hospital had been beyond criticism . This was utterly unexpected . It has been a profound shock to us all . " He was a lean , dark man , with alert , wiry movements , and features which were thin , colorless , enigmatic . " There must have been a reason . Is n't there always a reason ? " " But a reason may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in his work ? " " So I 'd thought . Anyway , he 'd always taken whatever he wanted . " " I heard something about that . Fell in love with his wife 's sister . Well , I do n't wonder . She 's a lovely creature , and strangely appealing . But , even nowadays , an act like that is not so easily lived down , in our profession . " " It cut them both off from their former lives . His first wife , my other daughter , is a fine woman , and very attractive . None of us could understand his infatuation , but , oh , well . . . " " None of us ever can . Sex is a darn queer instinct . . . an inflammable substance . " " Did they seem happy here ? " " That 's not easy to answer . I saw her only when she wasp285unhappy and nervously overwrought . There was a slight operation after she had brought on a miscarriage . I 've heard that they quarrelled a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to murder or suicide . There were financial difficulties , too , I imagine . I should say she would be an expensive luxury for a man of limited means . He had trouble , I know , in paying the rent of this apartment , and I am told that he was deeply in debt . " " No doubt . " Asa glanced in disgust round the room . " It all seems such a waste . " " That 's the worst of it . Good material , a brilliant mind , an amazing energy , all gone to waste . " He drew out his watch . Doctors and nurses , it seemed to Asa , were eternally consulting their watches . " Well , I 'd better take a look at her . There was nothing I could do but keep her quiet . The sooner she can get out of this apartment , the better it will be for her . " The nurse appeared at the exact moment , and together they passed into the obscurity of Stanley 's bedroom . A shade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the doctor 's changed voice , soothing , caressing , infinitely consoling . He waited patiently until the visit was over , and Dr. Spanger came out and drew him into the hall , at the head of the staircase . " She will be all right , " Dr. Spanger declared , resuming his impersonal manner . " I 've left instructionswith the nurse , and she will give you the medicine you may need on the train . Let her sleep as much as possible , and do n't give her another dose unless it is necessary . If you 've got a drawing-room , she can lie down all the way . " " Yes , I stopped at the ticket office this morning . We 're leaving at three o'clock . "  | ing him . When I threatened to go home , he said that , after ruining his career , I was doing my best to send him to the devil . We had it all over again last night , and he began to shout that he could not live with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it is going to end . When I think that just a very few months ago , I imagined that love was all I needed to make me happy . Tell Roy , if she knew what I had suffered , she could n't hate me any longer . I cannothelp feeling that I have saved her from having to stand Peter 's craziness  --  if he is really crazy . " Write to me , darling Mother , and will you ask Uncle William what he would advise me to do . He sent me a wonderfulcheque by Parry , and I begin to cry whenever I think of his goodness . We have scarcely anything , and that little goes to pay for our bare living . " Your unhappy but loving daughter , " Stanley . " " Yes , it 's a mess all right , " Asa said , as he gave back the letter . Lavinia sobbed under her breath , while she read over the first and the last page . " I ca n't understand Peter , " she murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more command over his nerves ? " " Or his muscles . But I never thought that Peter was cut out for a surgeon  --  or even for a physician . He lacks what we used to call a healing presence . " " But he seems so big and strong . " Asa laughed . " There 's more to a man than mere bone and muscle . " " Are n't big men usually stolid ? Look at Uncle William . " " If you do n't mind , my dear , I 'd rather not . "  | " You sound so bitter , Asa . " " I 've always sounded bitter , Lavinia , about your Uncle William . I suppose I owe him too much . " " When you say things like that , it makes people think that you resent his success . " The twinkle in Asa 's eyes was clouded by anger . " I resent that kind of success , anyway . It killed my father and my mother , and it helped to make a failure of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily . What , in God 's name , was the use ? " I am sorry , Asa . " Lavinia was gazing at him with wounded sweetness . " I know you are sensitive . " " I 'm not sensitive . " His voice rose and fell and trailed off into a murmur . " I 'm hard-shelled . I 'm a public enemy . But I 'll be darned if I 'm a pious humbug like William . " " Asa . " Calmly , without a rising inflection , Lavinia 's voice bore down on his outburst . " Asa , there is nothing to get so worked up about . I was only trying to make you see . . . " " All right , I see . So stop trying . " " You never used to be like this . I do n't know what has come over you . " She put her hand to the spot which literature , if not life , has assigned to the heart . " Can there be something wrong with your blood pressure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In a minute , but before Selina comes up , I want to ask you about Stanley . Do n't you think we ought to take her away from Peter ? " " Good God , no . After we 've taken her away , what are we going to do with her ? " " She would have to come here . " " And wreck Roy 's peace for a second time ? " " Well , after all , Stanley is her sister . "
