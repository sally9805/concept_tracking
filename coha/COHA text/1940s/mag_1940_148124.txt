Wags in busy , whirring Seattle joke about the woman who told a census taker : " I have three sons , two living and one in Portland . " Easy-going Portlanders scorn their frenetic rival to the north , refer with somnolent pride to their " city where it 's always afternoon . " <P> Last week Portland 's afternoon quiet was abruptly shattered . From Dr. Paul J. Raver , the brisk administrator of Bonneville Dam , came the biggest news the Northwest has had in many a noontime . Aluminum Co. of America had contracted to build a $3,000,000 plant on the Columbia River eight miles from Portland and two miles west of Vancouver , Wash. , use 32,500 kilowatts of Bonneville power ( to be transmitted over aluminum cables ) . <P> To Portland , to all Oregon and to Seattle as well , these were stupendous tidings . Ever since the U. S. Government began to build Bonneville Dam ( on the Columbia River ) with its huge potential output of 502,400 kilowatts , and Grand Coulee Dam farther up the same river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question in the Northwest has been : Who will buy the power ? Enterprising , efficient private utilities already had developed home consumption of electricity in Oregon to a point nearly twice the national average ( 760 kw-h per customer ) . Clearly the one answer was to get new industries to open shop within transmission distance of the dams . <P> The Bonneville-Grand Coulee area of Oregon and Washington is far from eastern and midwestern markets ; freighting costs are high . Private utilitarians pointed out that they had tried for years to overcome these handicaps . Asked how Federal amateurs could expect to do better , Paul Raver 's retort was the Aluminum Co. contract . " A nice Christmas present , " he called it . He now expects to convince many more processors ( chiefly of metals and chemicals ) that they can save enough with ultracheap power to pay for the long hauls of raw materials and finished goods .
