There are too many schools of journalism in the U.S. and most of them are far from good enough . This was the conclusion reached by a report issued last week by the National Council on Professional Education for Journalism-a council whose chief mover is the dean of one of the best schools , Kenneth Olson of Northwestern University . <P> The 32 schools which belong-by invitation only-to the American Association of Schools and Departments of Journalism consider themselves quite plausibly the Class A of their field . Their faculty members must have five years of practical journalistic experience . All have completely equipped city rooms , reporting and editing laboratories . <P> But the boom market for school training has created such a demand for it among college students that now more than 500 institutions , besides the 32 Class A schools , offer journalism courses of sort , ranging from nearly Class A caliber down to bedraggled asides in English majors . <P> The report of the National Council estimates that in 1939 ( the year covered by its survey ) 2,600 graduates were sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of these , 816 were Class A fledglings . Plain implication : if colleges and universities would refrain from teaching journalism , without firstclass man power , organization and equipment , a higher proportion of graduates would find jobs and would fill them better .
