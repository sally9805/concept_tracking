The Marshall Plan , for months one of Europe 's few promises of hope , had at last become reality by act of the U.S. Congress . John Osborne , chief of TIME 'S London bureau , cabled the following account of how Europeans took the news : <P> Never before have the attitudes and acts of one nation mattered so much to so many people in the world as every impulse , wish and act of the U.S. will hereafter matter to the Western world . Never before have the attitudes and capacities of so many other nations mattered so much to the U.S. What awaits Americans in the Europe which they have undertaken to preserve , restore , and if need be to defend ? <P> Not a great deal of confidence . The House of Representatives ' short-lived amendment to include Spain in ERP ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ; showed that clearly . A great many people have suffered agonies of apprehension over the news . It caused instant repercussions within the Labor Party and the trade unions , most of which had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual deed is now canceled , its effects will be felt for a long time . One aftereffect here will be a revival of the deep-seated assumption that Americans are unpredictable and therefore difficult fellows to live with . <P> The Question . Americans can not expect to find gratitude , either , although Europeans are astonished by the bold and on the whole unfettered form which Marshall aid has taken . It contradicts all that they had presupposed of the U.S. Congress , which in these parts is expected to do the right thing in the wrong way , if at all . Wrote the Manchester Guardian : " The U.S. has risen to the occasion . It is now for the nations of Western Europe to do no less . " But the deepest wish of our friends in Europe is that they did not have to accept our aid . <P> The most Americans can expect- and it is a lot-is a better European understanding of the impulses and motives of which America is capable . We and the Russians between us have made it very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europeans sensed that only the unique and uncalculated generosity of millions of Americans made Mr. Marshall 's offer possible last June . That is still remembered , though not with unalloyed joy . The human heart in the coal valleys of Wales or beside the Po is pretty much what it is in Kansas . People do not like to be excelled , even in generosity . <P> Our billions and our goods are going into a Europe which is worse than bankrupt . It is an ill and disordered Europe , a psychotic wasteland , with certain islands of relative sanity . We should be neither surprised nor disappointed if our dollars do not heal the inner hurts of Europe . <P> The physical damage of war can perhaps be repaired . It is superfluous to say : this will not be enough . We know it . Europeans know it . The relevant question is whether anything can be enough ; whether there is still in Europe the making of a real revival . <P> It is not apparent now . But the wish and the cry for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearning , it is for a belief , a life , a place worth having and holding . The immediate symptoms of this half-conscious need are two common emotions , which will condition many of the attitudes which we encounter with our aid in Europe . One is pride . The other is guilt .
