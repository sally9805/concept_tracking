Many a citizen in the past three years has wanted to reform the reforms of the New Deal , to install standards of judicial fair play in the reform agencies . First effort to reform the reformers was the defunct Logan-Walter bill ( for legal tests of administrative rulings ) , which might have thrown so much sand in the gears that nearly all New Deal agencies would have ground to a halt . In vetoing the bill , President Roosevelt reminded Congress that his Attorney General 's committee had been working for two years on the same question , had still to report . <P> Last week a majority of that committee , headed by onetime Braintruster Dean Gooderham Acheson , newly appointed Assistant Secretary of State , made its report - 1,000 exhaustive pages . Over-all conclusion : more informal cooperation be tween businessmen and the regulatory agencies will do most to improve matters . Recommendations : <P> 1 ) Establishment of an Office of Federal Administrative Procedure , to keep an eye on the agencies . <P> 2 ) Independent commissioners to conduct formal hearings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thus be eliminated . <P> 3 ) A 45-day delay before any rule by any administrative agency goes into effect . <P> 4 ) Issuance in advance of advisory opinions on request , to let citizens know whether contemplated actions are within the law . <P> 5 ) No decisions on cases by investigators or prosecutors within agencies . <P> The committee also filed two minority reports : one proposing a flat code of fair administrative practice and placing greater stress on judicial review ; the other recommending a wholly independent board ( like the Board of Tax Appeals ) with un restricted power to review all agency rulings . <P> The New York Times hailed the Acheson report as a " landmark in the history of administrative reform . " The Senate 's Judiciary Committee went to work on these reports at once .
