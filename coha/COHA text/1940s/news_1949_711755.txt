txt An increase in state taxes will provide the main issue before the new Legislature when it convenes on Wednesday for its 172d annual session , it appeared today . It is the first time in ten . years that a rise in state taxes is being seriously considered . Other major questions that the new session will be called upon to deal with include reform of the state 's ancient divorce law , provision of additional loan funds and subsidies for public housing , simplification of local building codes , rent control , revision of the military law and establishment of a civilian defense organization and the broadening of social welfare laws to provide disability benefits and increased unemployment insurance benefits . Also , the legislators may be called on to authorize an investigation into the administration of New York City under Mayor O'Dwyer , principally for the purpose of strengthening Republican chances in next fall 's Mayoralty election .

Two principal sources of additional revenue to finance prospective increases in the budget have been considered by Governor Dewey ill discussions of the state 's financial problem with Republican legislative leaders . They are : Restoration of the personal income tax to the rate prevailing in 1941 , when it was two-thirds higher than it is now ; and , the imposition of an additional one-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax . The income-tax increase , according to latest estimates , might raise $125,000,000 or more in new revenues . The gasoline tax increase , if consumption remains at the 1948 levels , would provide another $21,000,000 .

Tax Picture Complicated The legislative tax situation is complicated by the fact that the personal income-tax rates will rise to 110 per cent of the levels of 1941 , an 831/3 per cent increase over the 1948 schedules , unless action is taken at this session . This is due to the practice of voting " temporary " personal incometax cuts in. the past six years . Unless these reductions are renewed annually , the rates return automatically to the 1941 level . In addition , and in the absence of change , taxpayers will be liable for the 10 per cent surtax voted to finance the veterans ' bonus , thus to make the actual rate the 110 per cent of 1941 schedules . Closely tied up with the question of the raising of taxes are the demands for additional state aid for schools and municipalities ; continuation of the highway and parkway construction and reconstruction program now being pressed , and provision of sufficient new funds to put under way the enlarging and improving of the mental-hospital system .
