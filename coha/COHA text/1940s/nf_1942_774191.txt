txt  | denies the possibility of disagreement or conflict between two people who are really in love . Since the courtship has , also been romantic , the bride and groom may never have had an unbiased view of each other . As the practical daily tasks of married life supersede the romantic aspects , the possibilities for conflict increase . The sentimental attitude toward love and marriage is replaced by the commonplace realization that here are two people whose lives are intertwined and each of whom is limited in his activities by the other . The individualism and independence ? of premarital days are curtailed in the joint life . Disagreements , opposition , and anger result from these mutual frustrations . But usually these emotions are held in check by the counter sentiments of romance and love , and the belief that somehow or other the two should be one in attitude and sentiment . When the conflict is not checked by the counter-emotions it flares into quarrels , occasionally into physical combat . Each sees the other as the personal cause of the frustrations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity that marks the fully developed family . Anger and hatred replace trust and love as the common emotions . Marriages in which conflict comes to be the common type of interaction tend to disintegrate . In most families the conflicts remain incipient or , if they occasionally flare out , end in reconciliation , and the process of adjustment , accommodation , and assimilation continues . At first in the newness of the situation every step toward the final adjustment is consciously made . The wife must find out how strong the husband wants his coffee and what time he must arise in the morning in order to get to work on time . The husband must learn that to his wife permanent waves are more important than golf equipment , and that ashes on the rug are not to be tolerated . Literally hundreds of small adjustments must be made in the early days of married life , each of which requires self-denial on the part of one , or some sort of compromise by both . As these adjustments are made , both husband and wife maneuver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much liberty as possible for their particular desires and inter ests . A satisfactory accommodation is well on its way when the sacri ? fices are not one-sided . Accommodation is not domination ; it is a mu  | tual process whereby each party obtains some of his interests and the admission by the other that those interests and rights are not to be disturbed . Thus there is security and certainty in the relationship . The wife may learn that to her husband golf is more important than hairdressing , but she receives the assurance that the hair-dresser may be patronized at less frequent intervals . In the typical family , accommodation involves the often unspoken agreement that the wife shall be dominant in certain fields of activity and the husband shall be dominant in others . When this agreement follows the traditional pattern of the housekeeping wife and the wage-earning husband , the accommodation is quickly made . Less easily made are the accommodations on personal roles made ; but accommodation can not be regarded as complete until both husband and wife can accept unemotionally the emotional idiosyncrasies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when assimilation has been accomplished between two married people , they cease to be husband and wife as two distinct entities and become a family , whether or not children are included . For family is the only collective noun we have to signify the unity of marriage and the same attitudes of identity may prevail whether the family consists of husband and wife or of parents and children . Assimilation is a merging of once different attitudes into common attitudes . The common belief that married people come to look and act alike is a recognition of the process of assimilation , for back of the common gestures and facial expressions are common attitudes and beliefs . It is because of this assimilation that the widow or widower feels " lost " when death has first claimed the spouse . The person who has become assimilated into a family has lost much of his individuality and independence ; conversely , the highly individualistic married person is not fully assimilated into the family . The processes of incipient conflict , of conscious adjustment , and of accommodation are part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled " family , in which husband and wife feel secure .

Nimkoff , for instance , says that it is incorrect to speak of the family when there are no children . ' The crux of the family group is the relationship between the parent or parents and the children . Thus the simplest form of family would be mother and child , while the fully developed family would consist of mother , father , and child . He uses marriage to refer to the relationship of husband and wife , while family is reserved for the relationship between parents and children . It is incorrect , he says , to refer to a " childless family , " for there is no such thing ; rather one should say a " childless marriage . " Other writers regard this distinction as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the group consists of husband and wife alone , or of parents and children . Certain it is that whether children are present or not they are usually thought of as a real or potential part of the family group . For example , among some 13,000 Maryland youth between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four , 84 per cent of the boys and 89 per cent of the girls wanted eventually to have one or more children.2 The percentage was higher in the youth twenty to twenty-four years of age th n in those under twenty years old , a fact interpreted by the author s meaning that the nearer youths approached the actuality of pare thood the more favorably inclined toward it they felt . Bugess and Cottrell , using a smaller but an intellectually more so- footnote i M F. Nimkoff , The Family , Houghton Mifflin , 1934 , pp. 7-8. 2 H. M. Bell , Youth Tell Their Story , American Council on Education , 1938 , p. 36.  | phisticated group , already married , found that 493 couples were distributed as follows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but both husband and wife desired children 32.4 per cent One or more children , which were desired by both husband and wife 37.8 per cent No children , and either husband or wife or both desired none .. 22.5 per cent One or more children , but either husband or wife or both did not desire children 7.3 per cent The interest in children is shown also by the eagerness of childless families to adopt children . It is estimated that sixteen or seventeen thousand children are adopted in the United States each year , ' and still the requests for children outstrip the supply of available children . Other childless families find substitutes for children in animal pets . Not only are children desired by the majority of adults , but children have a definite relationship to the type of family adjustment that develops . Burgess and Cottrell found that a close association existed between the desire for children and marital adjustment.5 The percentage of couples with good marital adjustment varied as follows : one or more children , not desired , only 11 per cent with good adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good adjustment ; one or more children who were desired , 47 per cent with good adjustment ; no children , but desired , 64 per cent with good adjustment . The authors suggest two interpretations : one , that the couple may have married with the normal expectation of having children , but because of marital unhappiness developed an aversion to having children . On the other hand , couples may marry with a determination not to have children ; these people , the authors state , may be ones who do not want to assume responsibility , and this unwillingness to assume the normal responsibilities of married life may be the root of the malad ? justment rather than the lack of children themselves . Whichever interpretation is correct , the desire for children becomes an index of footnote3 E. W. Burgess and L. S. Cottrell , Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage , Prentice Hall , 1939 , p. 414. 4 Social Work Yearbook , Russell Sage Foundation . 5 Burgess and Cottrell , op. cit. , p. 414.  | marital happiness , and the family with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed is six times as likely to be happy as the one in which children are present but not desired , and three times as likely to be happy as the family in which no children are wanted . Fortunately the families with unwanted children are few in number . PARENTAL ROLES As soon as a child is born , husband and wife each have dual familial roles ; for to the husband-role is added the father-role , and to the wiferole is added the mother-role . When , as was more commonly true in past generations than it is today , the first child was born within twelve or eighteen months after marriage , the entire process of adjustment to marriage , to each other , and to the birth of a child took place almost simultaneously . The husband-role and the father-role developed together , the wife-role and the mother-role together . At the present time the tendency is for the married couple to postpone the birth of a child until they " get used to each other , " or can afford to buy furniture or a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbandwife roles develop independently of the father-mother roles . When this happens , there is ample opportunity for conflict of several types , even when the child has been planned for , and almost certainly when the child is more or less unwanted . The woman herself may not be able to reconcile her two roles . The role of the young wife in middle-class society permits her a great deal of freedom , once her household duties are performed ; or they permit her to work outside her home . But it is a part of the same middle-class mores that the mother should herself care for her child ; and there is whispered neighborhood comment of an unfavorable nature regarding the young mother who turns her child over to a relative or a maid while s he attends clubs and parties , or continues to work . The child may b well cared for , but in the folk belief there is an almost superstitio s faith in the value of the personal ministrations of the mother . Often the mother herself shares in this belief , while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , entitled to  | the freedom of the young wife . Thus she may feel thwarted if she remains at home to care for her child , or guilty if she arranges for the care of the child and continues her outside activities . The husband likewise finds it necessary to change his pattern of life . Pressure of friends and salesmen will be put on him to carry added insurance and to establish an educational fund for his child . He may dislike to curtail his expenditures to do this , but may feel guilty if he does not do it . He may find also that he must deny himself certain club or business activities to aid his wife in the care of the child . Thus both husband and wife struggle between the individualism that was theirs as modern young married people and the roles of parents , tinged with duties from the past . The interrelationships of husband and wife also are disturbed by the parental roles . Often during the early period of marriage the role of the young wife resembles temporarily that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife whose dominant activity is to look well and to accompany her husband on pleasurable jaunts . But when a child is born , the wife begins to assume the mother-role , the privilege of which is to have the loyalty and respect of the husband . But this shift in the role of the wife calls for a corresponding shift in the role of the husband . The actual changes made may involve such things as the way evenings and week-ends are spent , the mother being no longer free to accompany her husband to club or movie or dance hall in the evening , or on week-end trips . Sometimes both husband and wife remain at home and develop family activities ; sometimes the husband spends certain evenings away from home with men friends , and on other evenings cares for the baby while his wife goes out with women friends . Occasionally the husband attempts to substitute some woman friend for his wife as a companion in recreation ; but this violates the middle-class mores and may lead to serious conflict between husband and wife . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the addition of a baby . Until a generation or so ago , the child was fed unceremoniously when hungry and laid in the cradle when sleepy . When the family wished to go somewhere , the child was taken along and if he became sleepy was laid on some convenient  | bed or held in the arms . The child was then rather incidental in the routine of the household . But now the child has a fixed routine , upon the maintenance of which depends much of the status of new parents among their friends . This routine calls for feeding at regular intervals , usually at the hours of two , six , and ten A. M. and two , six , and ten P.M. It also calls for a regular bedtime and for putting the child to bed in his own crib . Especially in the urban family this routine is likely to conflict with the habits previously established , which had as their basis the time when the husband had to be at work and when he returned from work . Thus the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the management of the household tends to center about the child . Parental roles permanent . Much has been written about the small size of families today in comparison with families of the past . In 1930 the median size of family of related persons in the United States was 3.40 persons , which would mean one or two children per family . The census family , defined as persons in the household rather than related persons , was 4.1 persons in 1930 ; 4.7 persons in 1900 ; 5.1 persons in 1870 ; and 5.7 persons in 1790 when the first census was taken . The very large family of ten or more members comprised one in ten families in 1790 , but in 1930 less than one family in fifty had ten members. ? At the present time the " large family " may be thought of as including six or more related persons . In 1930 , 18.5 per cent of all families were of this size . When rural and urban families are contrasted , 29 per cent of rural families had six or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A special study of New Haven , Connecticut , shows the classification along occupational lines : approximately one third of the families of unskilled laborers consisted of six or more persons ; about one fourth of the families of semi-skilled and skilled workers ; and about ne fifth of the families of business managers and proprietors . Prof sional men and white collar workers even less frequently had lar/ge families. ? With numerous children , the period during which young children footnote6 Mildred Parten and R. J. Reeves , " Size and Composition of American Families , " imerican Sociological Review , 1937 , Vol. 2 , pp. 638 if . 7 Ibid.  | are in the family is a long one . A study by Richardson of 2,193 completed Chicago families shows that the average period during which these families had cared for one or more children under sixteen years of age was twenty-three years.8 The time during which the mother was responsible for a child or children under seven years of age ranged from seven years in the one-child family to thirty-one years in families with seven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under seven was fourteen years . The roles of parenthood are not temporary , to be assumed for a short period and then cast aside . Once husband and wife become father and mother , they must play their new roles for a long period . The adjustment to children can not be thought of as a temporary or emergency affair ; it must become the habitual way of life . THE FAMILY AND PERSONALITY ADJUSTMENT Potentialities of the child . The human baby is born with many potentialities of action , feeling , and thinking . Only part of these are evident at birth or during early babyhood . The young baby has many reflexes ? simple physical reactions to stimuli , such as crying and withdrawing from pain , grasping anything that is placed in his hand , blinking , swallowing , sucking if his lips are touched , digesting his food , and so on . These reflexes occur in response to physical stimuli , and represent simple but very important adjustments to the physical environment . The baby also has the capacity for much random muscular activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on springs ; later his activity is co-ordinated and he crawls , runs , and jumps . But for some time this co-ordinated activity seems purposeless ; it is not organized into habits or skills . The baby has emotional reactions . At first the emotions are diffused excitement , but within a few months of birth two emotions may be distinguished : distress and delight . Distress gives the basis for the later development of aggression and avoidance , which are accompanied respectively by the emotions of anger and fear . Delight leads to the more differentiated emotions of love , joy , and footnote8 A. E. Richardson , " The Woman Administrator in the Modern Home , " Annals American Academy of Political and Social Science , 1929 , Vol. 143 , pp. 22-23.  | pleasure . At first these emotional reactions are directed toward only a few objects and are not finely differentiated into tones of feeling such as are felt by the sensitive adult . The baby also has the capacity for mental development ? for thinking and reasoning , for remembering and learning , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opinions , or attitudes.9 Thus the young child has capacities for adapting to a very large number of circumstances , but at birth the capacities are not fully developed and have not been organized into purposeful and integrated patterns . The baby is more or less like a sponge , ready to absorb habits , fears , likes and dislikes , language , religion , and much else , from those with whom he associates . By the time the baby is a year old he has definite preferences and dislikes for people . But his memory is still short , and he will forget even his mother if she is absent for a week . ' ? His capacity for emotional and mental growth , however , increases so rapidly that it may truthfully be said that during the first six years the child 's mental growth takes place at a much greater rate than at any other time.11 Faegre and Anderson , child psychologists , term this the period of beginnings . During this early period the child acquires the fundamental habits of physical routines , of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment . Although it is probably an exaggeration to say that the child 's personality is irrevocably formed during the first three or four years of life , it is recognized that adolescent and adult maladjustments and shortcomings often have their roots in deficiencies in training or in unfortunate experiences that occurred during the first five or six years of life . During this early period the child is , on the whole , receptive . Brown speaks of " passive adaptation " as characteristic of the young child.12 The child has no habits , opinions , or attitudes of his own with which to contrast those which al . /impressed upon him by his immediate adult world . He has no oice but to accept the culture of the adult footnote9 M. L. Faegre and J. E. nderson , Child Care and Training , University of Minnesota Press , 1937 , p. 103 if . 10 Winifred Rand , M. E. Sweeny , and E. L. Vincent , Growth and Development of the Young Child , Saunders , 1940 , pp. 52-54. 11 Faegre and Anderson , op. cit. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 F. J.

He learns to speak the language he hears ; he becomes selfreliant if he is given responsibilities by those who rear him , or he becomes dependent if all responsibility is removed from him ; the things he fears are often those feared by the older children he plays with or by his parents . On the whole children are receptive to the influences about them . When the young child rebels , it is usually against immediate thwarting and obstruction of his desires . Later , as experience gives the child participation in other and different groups , he may rebel against earlier groups and reject their teaching . Because the child is plastic and is subject to the influences of those about him , the group that incorporates the child during his early years is extremely important in the formation of the child 's physical and mental habits , his attitudes , and his emotional and social adjustment . Importance of the family . In our society the family is the agency designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many children are born in hospitals and remain under the care of a pediatrician for years , after the first two weeks of life their daily care and training arc carried on in the home . Nursery schools for children of two years and over are often referred to as indicating a trend toward institutional care of young children ; but so far the movement is still indicative of a trend rather than of a common practice , for only a very small percentage of the children of the United States attend nursery schools or day nurseries , or even kindergartens . Many of those who do attend spend only three or four hours in the nursery school or kindergarten and then return home . Thus the entire care of most young children and most of the care of all young children remains in the hands of the family . Types of family influence . In analyzing the relationship of the child to his parents , a distinction can be made between the development of traits of personality in the child and the inculcation of the culture of the group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the social roles discussed in the previous chapter in connection with the early adjustment of husband and wife . Husband and wife have acquired in their own parental families the first conceptions of their personal roles and their social roles ; in their turn they will  | influence the personal roles and the social roles of their own children . From the point of view of the training given to the child , the distinction between the personal and the cultural is artificial , for the parents do not make any such classification of their relationships with their children . They do not at a certain time of day say , " Now , I will develop Johnnie 's personality , " and at another hour say , " Now it is time o inculcate the culture . " The two processes go on simultaneously and often unconsciously . Nevertheless , in the analysis of family relationdhips and in the results produced within the child , a distinction may he made , and for clarity of discussion is so made in this chapter . The personality effects of family interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out between the two parents , m d between the parents and their children . In all ranks and classes ! here are domineering fathers and submissive mothers ; there are jealous mothers ; there are parents who compete with each other for the ove of their children ; there are older children who are envious of younger brothers or sisters . The interaction that goes on among the members of a family as each seeks to satisfy his desires has a very deep influence on the personality of the young and impressionable members . The cultural impress varies not by the type of interaction found in he individual family , but according to the cultural tradition of family . Of course families have some individual cultural traits ; but they are also part of larger cultural groups . Each of these larger groups will have some basic uniform cultural elements , shared by all its members . I Ience the cultural training given by its families will create similarities ! lot only among members of each family but among members of each ocial class , each regional group , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass on to the children the culture of the larger groups of which they are a part . The family is importa t also because of the peculiarly intimate and lose association of its embers which exists in most families . In his nalysis of social relatio ships , Cooley termed the family a " primary " coup ? so called because it was the first group to influence the child and the most important.13 Faris further amplifies the concept of a primary group by saying that it is a group with group consciousness , footnote1s C. H. Cooley , Social Organization , Scribner 's , 1909 , pp. 23-31.  | esprit de corps , a feeling of " we . " 14 In other words the primary group is one in which the members identify themselves with the group . Usually , and this is always true for the young child , the primary group has first-hand , face-to-face contacts ; but it need not be so , as an adult or older child could feel in perfect rapport with a primary group from which he had been separated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family which makes it effective as a center of training of child personality . The child who is reared in a family with a high degree of unity is deeply influenced in that he acquires a feeling of identification with the family and patterns his conduct along the lines desired by the family . Conversely , a family which lacks unity ? that is not really a primary group in spirit ? will not so readily mold the child into the family pattern , nor aid him so completely to achieve an integrated personality . It will not be less influential , but its influence on the child will tend to be adverse in terms of the child 's development of adequate habits and a well-balanced emotional and social adjustment . It should be recognized also that the family which has unity and is a primary group is not necessarily a good influence upon the child . Such a family may teach the child to steal or may spoil the child , and so make his later social adjustment difficult , or it may fail to instill good physical habits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply to say that it is very powerful in that it induces its members to feel identified with it ; but as Ogburn has pointed out , it may be powerful for evil or powerful for good.15 The importance of incorporation in a primary group is evident when the children that we see every day in the family group are contrasted with children who have lacked such inclusion in families . Isolated children . An occasional newspaper story gives an account of some child who has been confined in basement or garret for a period of years and who has failed to develop normally . One such child was studied by Kingsley Davis.16 footnote14 Ellsworth Faris , The Nature of Human Nature , McGraw ? Hill , p. 40. 15 W. F. Ogburn in Margaret E. Rich , editor , Family Life Today , Houghton Mifflin , 1928 , p. 34. 16 Kingsley Davis , " Extreme Social Isolation of a Child , " American Journal of Sociology , 1940 , Vol. 45 , pp. 554 ? 565.  | Anna , a child of six , was discovered in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of a farmhouse . She was at once removed to the county home , where she was carefully examined by physicians and observed by Dr. Davis . She was very unresponsive and could not talk , and at first was thought to be deaf and perhaps blind . Her muscles were flaccid , and she was unable to walk . She lay inert and did not respond to attempts at conversation or to clapping of the hands . She did notice the ticking of a clock and the opening of a door . She could take only liquids and had to be fed from a bottle or a spoon . This child was the second illegitimate child born to the daughter of a farmer . For a time she was boarded with a practical nurse who found her entirely normal . When she was between six and ten months old she was taken home by her mother . The mother 's father was very indignant at the appearance of a second illegitimate child and did not wish even to see the child . Consequently the mother confined the child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of trouble to her , she paid as little attention to her as possible . Almost the only food given to her was milk , although when she was almost five her mother began to feed her thin oatmeal . However , she had never learned to eat solid foods . The mother did not trouble to bathe Anna , train her in physical habits , play with her , or caress her . The confinement , isolation from human contacts , and poor diet resulted in the apathetic , unresponsive child who was found when almost six years old . The result of tests and general observation indicated that Anna 's mother was probably a high-grade moron . The father was reported to be either a wealthy farmer or a syphilitic married man living in a nearby town . Anna remained in the county homO for about nine months and was then removed to a foster home whore a very understanding foster mother devoted much time to her . After ten months in the fostea home she was removed to a home for defective children . In the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention from the attendants , she was in a room alone and had few informal social contacts such as the child in a family normally has . Her physical condition improved with a special diet and massage . She learned to  | sit up , to jounce rhythmically up and down on the bed , manipulated toys but did not play with them , stuck out her tongue , learned to sit on the edge of the bed and dangle her feet . Later she liked to roughhouse and could " walk " if someone held her up . Socially she developed more slowly . She had temper tantrums , learned to laugh , learned to recognize and to like people . She did not learn to talk . In the foster home her development continued at a much faster rate . She learned to eat solid food in a normal manner , and to drink from a glass without help . She was very responsive in the manner of a oneyear-old child , learned to play with simple toys , learned to walk , and had definite likes and dislikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accomplishments were similar to those of a year-old child . She could not talk ; and although she had been taught toilet habits , she could not make her needs known but had to be watched . When ten months in the foster home failed to bring complete development to normal talking and dependability , she was placed in a home for defective children . The question arises , of course , whether Anna was feeble-minded . Davis points out that most children who have been found after a long period of childhood isolation can not be taught to speak . He is inclined to think that , even if Anna was feeble-minded , she would under normal family circumstances have learned to talk . Certainly she would have learned to walk , play , respond to others , show her likes and dislikes , and respond to habit training at an early age , if she had had normal primary-group contacts and care .

Kamala , untrained in human ways when adopted footnote17 Arnold Gesell , " The Biography of a Wolf-Child , " Harpers Magazine , 1941 , Vol. 182 , pp. 183-193 .

Harper , 1941.  | by the wolf , but with the plasticity of the human baby , had adapted herself to wolf culture . When she was first brought to the mission orphanage , she walked and ran on all-fours with a rhythmic movement and rapid stride . Her shoulders had become broad and powerful , her thighs extended at an obtuse angle , and her toes and hands spread . Her hands served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than to manipulate them . Her head and mouth were used to poke and pry , after the manner of animals . She lapped water ; solid food she seized with the mouth . When she was disturbed , she growled and showed her teeth . She was not afraid of the darkness ; and at intervals during the night , when wolves howled to each other , she would howl as the wolves howled . This howl was her whole vocabulary . Kamala by imitation had adopted the wolf culture as she found it in the den and on the hunt ; she was adjusted to the band of wolves as well as a human being could be , and this adjustment had meant her physical survival . Placed in the orphanage , her deficiencies for human contacts became apparent . For ten months she refused to have any social contacts . She would sit with her face to the wall and glance furtively at the other children ; she would not take so much as a biscuit from a human hand . Gradually , however , Kamala learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with animals as though they were toys ? a human reaction ? to respond to the missionary 's wife , and to associate with other children . Two years passed before she learned any words . Language came slowly ; during the first four years in the orphanage , she learned only thirty words , and during the fifth year fifteen words . She learned to understand what was said to her , to go on errands , sing , wear clothes , care for younger children , to like to w7ar clothing , to sleep in the dormitory at night , and to like to be ith people . She even came to fear the dark as did the other children . Two years of training were required to teach her to walk uprighf , and she was never able to run upright . Six years of training and association with people had brought Kamala to an essentially human type of life . She had renounced most of her wolf culture and had acquired human culture , human conventions , and responsiveness to human beings . These and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | be physical survival with very little human attention or with merely animal attention , human personality develops only through contacts in a primary group where the young and impressionable child is given constant informal attention . It seems especially significant that language , the medium through which we carry on most of our social contacts , is easily learned by the young child in the human family , but is learned only with difficulty at a later age by children who have been deprived of the early familial contacts . Such children , who have experienced extreme isolation , seem permanently handicapped when the opportunity comes for later social contacts . The family and emotional security . Foremost among the effects of the family on the child is the degree to which the family gives the child a sense of security and of belonging to a small , intimate group . The need of a sense of emotional security seems generally recognized now among both psychiatrists and sociologists . The cult of rejection of children by their parents , strongly advocated by John B. Watson in the 1920 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some nursery schools which make a fetish of impersonal relationships with the children . Watson at one time advocated a state school for children where they would be freed from the love of their parents.18 Now , special attention is given to children who have been freed from the love of their parents and who feel unwanted and rejected . Cuddling of the baby , love and appreciation of the older child are freely advocated as part of the training which gives a child a sense of security , of belonging to a family group , and a feeling of self-confidence . This sense ' of security comes when the child is thoroughly incorporated into a family group . The secure child has someone to love and in turn knows that he is loved . His needs and wishes are taken into consideration by the parents in their development of a common family organization , and as he grows older he comes to share the family aims and objectives . The secure child not only receives satisfactions from what the family does for him but in turn makes sacrifices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity of family life ; he is assimilated into the family culture . Also , the secure child is the child footnote18 J. B. Watson in V. F. Calverton and S. D. Schmalhausen , The New Generation , Macaulay , 1930 , Op. 72-73.  | who has been given a definite role to play . He knows what is expected of him , and he knows what reactions to expect from other members of the family . Moreover , his role must give him fulfillment of his needs and a sense of achievement . The following excerpt from a family narrative written by a college girl illustrates the relationships that bring emotional security to the child:19 My love and admiration for my parents have existed ever since I can remember . Our family life has always seemed so perfect in every essential detail that it is hard to imagine any sort of irritating relationship among us . My father and mother have always been very happy together . My parents were very considerate of each other and of me and there seems to be perfect understanding between us . My parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upbringing with that of being given sensible freedom were most valuable . I was encouraged to give them my friendship and companionship and they in turn showed an interest in me and a faith which made it absolutely necessary that I play up to their respect and make myself deserving . Their approval and praise were my greatest reward . At the same time that child psychologists advocate a feeling of security for the child , they issue a warning against either over-protection or domination of the child . The child who is over-protected and always shielded from hardships by his parents , who is not given responsibility , who is not encouraged to venture forth for himself , tends to become dependent upon his parents and to build up an exclusive emotional identification with them which he finds it difficult to break when maturity comes . In folk language , he is " tied to his mother 's apron strings . " Such over-protection may stem from the parents ' own feeling of insecurity and fear of new experiences , which they project upon the child ; they imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield him as they shield themselves . Or/one parent may have some feeling of guilt , perhaps because uncons/ciously he does not want the child ; and , through being overly solicitpus of the child , conceals from others and even from himself his true feelings . Again , the parent may need a closer love relationship than he'has and seek it through overindulgence of the child . Dominance by the parent in matters of authority may also develop footnote10 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family .  | dependence on the part of the child , in that he will always look for outside authority or permission for his actions . In other cases dominance may create rebellion in the child , if the child himself has a tendency toward dominance . Such rebellion characterized the college girl who wrote the following : 20 The discipline used in the family was the most overpowering repression possible . It struck with the death blow and if I had n't been of the same strength of spirit of my parents it would undoubtedly have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule . Not physical torture ? that would have been easy . It was a not-permitting just and hardearned rewards to be received because of some flare up of temper or other small prank which resulted in the vow really to do something worth the punishment sometime just to show them that they could n't punish me hard as they would see fit and to give them something to think about . My parents also called attention to all our defects in personal qualities ; I knew it could n't all be true and therefore I rebelled against it but at the same time I certainly felt miserable . In fact my whole inner life was a rebelling against the punishment received . Maternal dominance may result from the concentration of the mother upon her small brood . The present-clay mechanization of the urban home and the small number of children in many families have lightened the burden of homemaking for many women ; they may then turn all their attention to the minute regulation of their children 's lives . The overworked mother of a large family is saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also rest upon the parents ' effort to force the child into a way of life denied to the parents . The parent may project on the child his own longing for a college education or for some particular profession and may insist that the child have this training regardless of the child 's desires or abilities . As Plant says , such parents feel " an imperious urge that the next generation live as we wish we had lived , accomplish what we had hoped ourselves to do . " 21 Other parents go to the opposite extreme and reject a child , either consciously or unconsciously . Parents with the best of intentions may footnote20 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family . 21 J. S. Plant , Personality and the Cultural Pattern , Commonwealth Fund , 1937 , p. 262.  | reject a child in their attempts to make him self-reliant . They want him to " stand on his own feet , " not to be a " baby " or a " sissy . " This early forcing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shake his sense of security . The birth of a younger child may cause a child to feel rejected and unwanted . The following excerpt from a family narrative illustrates such a situation as felt by one girl : 22 I remember as a child having a savage desire to vent all of my pent up wrath and wounded feelings upon my sister because she seemed to be at the base of all my troubles . Before she came I was the spoiled child of an adoring family and that was all changed when she was born . It grieved my mother and angered my father when I displayed my strong dislike for the newcomer , so I soon learned to hide those feelings . It seemed to me that I was of no account and that she was continually petted and favored ; of course I realize now that many of those feelings were imaginary results of my sensitiveness to the change that occurred in my treatment when my sister was born . My beloved toys had to be given up to her if she fancied them and whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given up to " dear little sister because she is the baby . " Naturally I treated her unkindly and was punished . Every time I was punished I felt more resentful and aloof than ever . I learned to live very easily with myself in an imaginary world . From those early days on throughout childhood and adolescence I confided in no one fully . My problems remained mine . I might have avoided much childish worry by confiding in father or mother but the attitude built up by the mode of punishment and the handling of the little-sister problem worked against the impulse to confide my troubles to my parents . At the same time I loved my parents intensely and was very proud of them . Rejection occurs also when one or both of the parents do not want the child or feel that the child is a hindrance to the fulfillment of their own personal ambitions or desires . Fortunately , many parents who do not want a child before birth respond to him as an appealing baby and become attached to him . Sometimes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unplanned-for child is unw rated ; occasionally , such a family " sells " a child for adoption for a s all sum of money . An illegitimate child who threatens the social stars of the mother is usually undesired and may be rejected psychologidrally or physically , footnote22 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family .  | through placing the child with some agency which arranges to have it adopted . If the marital relationships are not harmonious , a child may be rejected by one parent because the parent has identified the child with the spouse and transfers to the child his aversion or even hatred of the spouse . The rejected child usually lacks a feeling of security and is uncertain of himself . Groves says that the neglected child is almost as helpless as though he had no parents , that he is , indeed , a " social orphan . " 23 In training children , therefore , a fine line must be drawn between desirable security on the one hand and undesirable over-protection on the other ; between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations and over-dominance . The child needs security , freedom , guidance , but not over-protection , rejection , or too great dominance . Several studies of personality traits of children give suggestive , although , in the present stage of investigation , not conclusive results regarding the effects of over-protection , dominance , and rejection . The studies indicate that children who are over-protected tend to be dependent , infantile , withdrawn , and that they possess feelings of inferiority , make poor social adjustments , and have poor work habits.24 When separated from their parents , protected children are homesick , even when they reach college age.25 Children who have dominant parents tend to show delinquency trends , to be either markedly aggressive and rebellious or very submissive , and to have school difficulties.26 Children who are rejected and who lack a sense of security tend to be overly aggressive , rebellious , hostile , jealous , overly eager for attention , and hyperactive ; they tend to be emotionally unstable ; footnote23 E.

The role of the dependent child , the submissive child , or the rejected child , once assumed , tends to carry over into extra-familial relationships ; but their origin is usually within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attitudes of the adult toward sex and family life are deeply influenced by his early experiences as a child in his own parental family . The family affords the child intimate contacts with those of his own and of the opposite sex and provides the arena in which conflicts between the sexes are first adjusted . According to the psychoanalytic view , the normal child goes through successive stages of interest in himself , the opposite sex , and others of his own sex . The young child is more interested in himself than in others ; he cries when he is physically uncomfortable , and much of his interest in others is to get them to satisfy his personal interests and to give him personal pleasure . The baby 's social interests are not fully developed , and he is not completely aware of other people . The baby does not recognize people at first ; during the first few years of life his memory is very short , and he can rather easily be passed from one pair of loving hands to another . As the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who feed him , dress him , tuck him into bed , and play with him . Normally , this person is the mother . But as the child becomes aware that people are not divided simply into adults and children , but into male and female as well , his attachments may tend to shift . The girl may respond to the attentions of her father and become jealous of her mother ; the boy may give attention to his mother and feel that his father is a rival for the mother 's attention . According to psychoanalytic theory , this process is normal and more or less inevitable . But many studies of children do not reveal a clear-cut situation . When the father and mother are impartial in their relationships with their sons footnote27 Hattwick and Stowell , op. cit. ; Symonds , op. " cit. , pp. 45-46.  | and daughters , the normal situation seems to be a somewhat more intense emotional reaction of both boys and girls to the mother , probably because the mother is the one who gives the children hourly supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother has developed a confidential relationship between herself and her children ; or it may be one of emotional antagonism if the mother and the child ( either boy or girl ) are at cross purposes . Thus two factors seem to be involved : the natural response of parent and child to one of the opposite sex , which may be slightly more pointed than response to one of the same sex ; and the particular personal relationships between parents and children without regard to differences of sex . It seems probable that usually the reactions of parent and child to each other are only moderately dependent upon the fact that they are of the same or opposite sex , unless the parent differs in his treatment of boy and girl . If the father makes much of his small daughter and neglects to give attention to his son or is harsh to his son , it seems very natural that the relationship will be close between father and daughter and antagonistic between father and son . Also , under these circumstances , the mother will often show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the indifference of his father . A close study of these cases might reveal that back of the parental reactions lies some lack of adjustment between husband and wife , so that each was seeking in the child of the opposite sex some of the satisfactions that normally should come from the spouse . Regardless of the preferences of early childhood , as children mature they usually identify themselves with the parent of the same sex . This identification is encouraged by parents and by other institutions . In assigning tasks to children , parents tend to pattern the girl 's work after her mother 's , the boy 's after his father 's . Boys and girls are encouraged to play different types of games : the boy is urged to be venturesome and not to be a " sissy " ; the girl on the other hand is restrained in her activities and cautioned not to be a " tomboy . " Toys are not simply toys for children but are boys ' toys or girls ' toys . Schools assign different tasks to boys and girls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In following out these activities the girl is associated with her mother , the boy with his father . The  | mother and daughter sew , cook , and clean together ; they attend concerts and teas together . The father and son wash the family car together , garden together , go hunting and fishing together . As son and daughter organize their activities around the male and female patterns , they acquire the typical attitudes of masculinity and femininity . As related to the family , they acquire the typical attitudes as well as an apprenticeship in the typical activities of husband and wife ; each learns to play the family role assigned by American culture to one of their sex . This identification with their own sex at first may lead the boy and the girl to be antagonistic toward those of the opposite sex . The boy will tease his sister and throw snow balls at the girls in the neighborhood ; the girl will complain if her brother wants to play with her and her girl friends . It is not clear , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate sexual antagonism . The activities encouraged in boys and girls are not only different but are opposed to each other . Girls are praised if they play house quietly under the apple tree ; boys are regarded with admiration if they climb the tree . When both activities are taking place around the same apple tree , there is a conflict of interests and activities regardless of sex . It seems probable that many of the cultural differences imposed upon boys and girls and the resulting conflict have been attributed erroneously to an innate antagonism between the sexes . As children approach adolescence , the earlier exclusive interest of boys in other boys and of girls in other girls begins to break down . At first the interest that boys and girls show in each other may be like that of two strange dogs who circle about each other , growling and snarling , uncertain whether to fight or to be friends . Thus young adolescent boys and girls pester and tease each other , hide each other 's pens and pencils , and walk past each other 's houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment is worked out , and friendships develop between boys /and girls . The basis is thus laid for the attitudes of companionship and co-operation that lead later into courtship and marriage . The progressive steps that hae been outlined , from self-interest through interest in the parent of the opposite sex , to identification with  | one 's own sex , and finally to interest in the opposite sex are the normal trends in development . But at any stage the child may fixate his behavior patterns and may not progress to the next stage . For instance , one may find adults who are still absorbed in their own feelings of comfort and discomfort and who expect others to inconvenience themselves in order to contribute to their pleasure ; other adults are so deeply attached to parents of the same or of opposite sex that they are unable to marry ; others are involved in clinging friendships with other adults of the same sex and remain shy and awkward with those of the opposite sex . These attitudes and patterns of behavior , abnormal in the adult , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal appearance , of stages of development that children typically follow . The family influences this progressive development of interest from self , to parents , to others of the same sex , to those of the opposite sex , in several ways . The parents themselves set a pattern either of conflict or of adjustment between the sexes which gives to their children a standard for the children 's future conduct in marriage . The relation of family experiences to the conception that young people hold of marriage and family life is evident from excerpts from family narratives . In one series of narratives college students were asked to state what changes in rearing their own children they would make from the way in which they themselves had been reared . Almost invariably those from unified and harmonious homes said they would rear theit children as they were reared and , by implication if not by direct statement , would play the same role to spouse and children that their own parents had played . Conversely , those from homes lacking in unity and harmony were critical of their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had been forced to get their conception of the ideal family from sources other than their , own families ; in so doing they often had developed a feeling of bitterness toward their own parents . The following excerpts are typical . The first is from a boy whose family was fairly well unified and who had only minor criticisms to make : 28 footnote28 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family .  | In our family there were six members , my two parents and four brothers . Of course between the brothers there was a great deal of squabbling and arguing which is natural where brothers are concerned . There were also arguments , some of them very tense , between my father and mother but they never stayed angry at each other for long . On the whole , I can say that our family led a fairly peaceful and serene life . There was generally a unity in family ideals and ambitions on the part of the parents . They wished us all to live lives of service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet too lenient . Within certain limits we were given a great deal of freedom in our thoughts and actions , but outside of that we were clamped down upon . Hardly ever do I think we were punished unjustly . On the whole I think my parents did a good job of raising us and they did their best . I hope I can do half as good a job as they did . I would try to be a little different in one way especially , not trying to solve their problems for them ; also in trying to develop a feeling of independence . The second excerpt was written by a girl who begins her story by saying , " My childhood was a very happy one . " The family was well unified and carried out many activities as a group . The children confided in their parents and the parents were well adjusted to each other . The final statement reads : 29 I think , in bringing up children of my own , I would try to go about it in much the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier or more ideal home than I have had . I think I would try to make my children just a little more dependent upon themselves and their own original standards than I have been . However , I should be very happy if my children would have the love , respect , and feeling of companionship for me that I have for my parents . A young man whose parents were divorced after a long period of family conflict states his pattern of family life as follows : 30 If I am ever so fortunate as to have a home of my own , I will do my best to provide a better atmosphere for my children . I would try to raise them in an atmosphere of contentment and mutual satisfaction and happiness . I would try never to permit the children to hear the parents become engaged in bitter arguments and ' quarrels . I would be strict , but by no means too severe . I would not whip the children unless it were absolutely necessary footnote29 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would strive to win their confidence and love and respect , and would try to point out the correct thing for them to do , and the mistakes they made , by reasoning instead of by force . Above all else I would try to be a pal to them ? sharing their secrets and their sorrows and their joys . I would try to teach them to live a good life , and to treat their fellow men with love and respect ? and I have a firm belief that the most effective way to teach anyone anything is not merely by words ? but above all else by example . The family is also in a position to guide the child at the critical points of transition from one stage of interest to another . The selfinterest of the baby is continued into childhood if the parents cater exclusively to him . The spoiled child of six is simply the self-centered , year-old baby who has not yet made the normal transition to group participation . Again , the assumption of the child of the role of the parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite sex ) will make difficult later adjustment of the child ; for , as stated above , our whole social system assumes one role for the boy and another for the girl . If the family fails to help the boy and the girl to assume , respectively , the masculine and the feminine roles , the boy and the girl will later find it difficult to adjust in school , at work , and in social groups . Mild cases of such failure to assume the expected role are found in the occasional college girl who wears a short , mannish haircut , severely plain shirts , and a man 's suit on all possible occasions . Such dress , of course , is less obvious when feminine slacks are the fad . Among young men there is the occasional one who curls his hair and indulges in feminine tastes and mannerisms . Carried to extremes , these tendencies point to definite abnormalities of personality ; but usually , in mild form , they signify only a failure of parents to develop in their boys and girls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . The following excerpt was written by a girl who identified herself with her father , and who as a child showed a tendency to play the role of a boy . The elder of two children , she had a younger brother : 31 footnote31 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family .  | When I was born , a boy was desired . Nevertheless , my parents really considered me a blessing . Being the first child , I was humored and spoiled . I cried for things and generally got them . I thought my father was almost perfect . He understood me perfectly and was a good sport . As a child I was the worst tomboy in the neighborhood and was proud of it . I was perfectly at ease with boys because I played with them more than with girls . There were n't many girls of about my age to play with me . My parents did not try to keep me in my own yard as some of the mothers did , but allowed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood tormented my younger brother and I had to take my brother 's part . I was very proud because I could " clean up " on the boy and could run fast enough to catch him after he had teased or hurt my brother . I played quite a lot with four other girls . They played with dolls a lot but I was n't interested . I never sewed clothes for them but operated on them and poured medicine into their hollow heads . I was a " boss " among the girls , but not an offensive one because we had so much fun . I would n't be a follower in a group of girls but was willing to listen to boys . As this girl matured , she assumed the feminine role to the extent of looking forward to marriage and children . Important for the future marital happiness of young people is the transition from interest in those of one 's own sex to interest in those of the opposite sex . Mothers who instill in their daughters a fear of men or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughters ' future marital adjustment . Too great restriction on dates may also make difficult the later procedures of courtship . The following excerpts show some common difficulties . A college man wrote as follows:32 When I was in high school , father held me back from dating with girls . He tried to keep me from dating as long as possible and when I did start going out he tried to restrict me as much as possible . I resented this and rebelled against it . When I did have a date I never told a thing about it to my parents , where I went or what I did . In regard to dancing , my parents were very much against it also and tried to make me stop . But along this line I would n't be bossed so I learned how to dance . My parents have always nagged me about going with girls , and my brothers and I have resented it to some degree . footnote32 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family .  | A girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her desire to gain popularity : 33 During my high school years I was never allowed to have a date . I still regret this very much because I would have grown accustomed to boys and would not have been so wild when I was turned loose . My sex knowledge was growing all the time from other girls . They obtained much obscene literature , which they passed on to me . I was greatly interested in boys , but at this time I was very shy when around them , so of course I was not a social success during my high school days . My first dates were the summer after I was a freshman in college . They were with a college man who knew that my experiences with boys had been very limited . He won my confidence and I became greatly infatuated with him . I greatly resented his familiarities but he convinced me that there was nothing wrong in them . After that I gradually became more popular with men , and now I am quite popular , because I am considered a jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I neck to some extent . I am a good dancer and my vitality never wanes on a party . By some strange fate the man with whom I was first infatuated fell in love with me ; by this time my infatuation had entirely passed . At first I thought I would marry him for his money , but I have now changed my mind . I am afraid to face the future . I want to marry , and yet I am afraid to tie myself down . I would never raise a child to regard the opposite sex as my mother raised me . I would explain the subject of sex to my daughter . My mother never mentioned a single phase of it . Another girl , whose parents were unwilling for her to make the transition from interest in other girls to an interest in boys , wrote : 34 High school brought the approved entrance of the opposite sex into my life . My parents had been so strict that I rebelled to myself and set out to fix things up . I reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby too long . I did n't want to feel that I should n't talk to the boys in my classes or go to the little parties given at their homes . I slowly won her over . Mother always knew where I was going and at what time I would be home . At first she said that I could not go out with anyone whom she had not seen , thus I had to refuse many an invitation until at last I made her see that there was no other way for her to meet the boys except for me to accept their invitations and let them come up to the house . Since then I have had no trouble . footnote33 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family . 34 Ibid.  | The family also has a responsibility in giving children instruction in sexual matters and in adequate attitudes toward sex . In a few cities the schools provide sex education ; but in general sex education is not provided for by any formal institution . It comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of adolescents found that slightly over half of the adolescents studied had received their first information about sex from their parents ; about io per cent from physicians , ministers , or teachers ; about 5 per cent from books or magazines ; and about 30 per cent from other children , either brothers and sisters or playmates . Boys were wont to receive their first information on sex from other boys , while girls were more likely to receive it from their parents . Thus , among urban white boys of native parentage , 44 per cent received their first information from other children , as contrasted with 17 per cent of the girls in this same classification . Thirty-three per cent of the boys , in contrast to 76 per cent of the girls , received their first information on sex from their parents.35 The age at which sex information is first had tends to be very low . Among 585 college students who answered on this point , 64 per cent of the men and 48 per cent of the women had their first information before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adolescence.36 This youthful age points to the need for the family to give this knowledge if it is to be given adequately , for obviously other children of the same age are unlikely to be reliable informants . The assumption of responsibility by the family to give sex education is important not only that the information may be accurate , but also because sex education in the family seems to be linked with the degree of intimacy between the parents and the children . The White House Conference study of adolescents showed the following association between confiding in parents and receiving from parents the first sex education.37 The figures are for urban white children of American parentage . Among boys who almost never confided in their fathers , 25 per cent received their first sex information from their parents ; in footnote35 R. S. Cavan , The Adolescent in the Family ( for the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection ) , D. Appleton-Century , 1934 , p. 193. 36Ibid. , p. 198. 37 Ibid. , p. 195.  | contrast , among boys who almost always confided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education at home . The same relationship is shown for girls : among girls who almost never confided in their mothers , 61 per cent received their first sex education at home , while among girls who almost always confided in their mothers , 8o per cent received their first information at home . This relationship is important in its implications , for it probably means that the adolescent who has not received sex information at home and who at the same time does not confide in his parents will find it difficult to turn to them for guidance in any critical problems concerning sex that may arise during early adolescence or youth . Types of parental control . The relationships within the family are usually determined by the parents . A suggestion as to the type of internal family organization that produces desirable results in family unity and in the personalities of children comes from a study by Mather , who analyzed the family histories written by two hundred college students.ss Four types of family control were found : ( 1 ) dominance by the father ? the traditional pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of control which we usually think of as aberrant , but which tends to develop in situations where the father 's status in the family is uncertain , or when the father is absent from home for long hours during the day or long periods of time ; it is the type of control which has tended to develop in the southern Negro family , the northern white suburban family in which the father works in the city , the family of the sea captain and of the travelling salesman ; ( 3 ) joint dominance by father and mother ? a modern type of partnership ; and ( 4 ) the family council ? an extension of the joint-dominance type into democratic family control , with the children joining in making decisions . The families with father-dominance were most numerous ; for 37.8 per cent of the families were of this type as compared with 28.4 per cent with joint dominance , 20.2 per cent with mother dominance , and 13.6 per cent with family control . The autobiographies were analyzed with reference to many aspects of family life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection , a full social life , loyalty and footnote38 W. G. Mather , Jr. , " Defining Family Types on the Basis of Control , " Family , 1935-1936 , Vol. 16 , pp. 9-12 . Also , compare pp. 181-182.  | solidarity , co-operation of members , joint use of family property , celebration of holidays and birthdays , and satisfaction of the students with their family life were all found in greatest proportions in the families with family council , next in families with joint dominance by the parents , then in families with father dominance , and least in families with mother dominance . More specifically , with reference to the relationship between children and parents , Mather found that confiding of children in their parents and freedom from tension were more often found in families with the family council , and so on in the same sequence . THE FAMILY AND THE CULTURAL HERITAGE The family not only influences the child 's personality but passes on to the child much of the cultural heritage of our society . When the child is still very young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The child is the passive recipient of the culture imposed upon him . He is born without ideas , attitudes , or knowledge into a social organization represented by the family , which at once begins to shape his personality into a reflection of the culture shared by the family.3s Malinowski calls the family the " very workshop of cultural development . " 40 Much of the process of imposing the culture upon the child is carried out by the parents without their consciousness of its significance . The parents themselves were reared in a particular cultural pattern , and they very naturally teach the child what they were taught . The culture impressed upon the child by the parents includes both the general culture patterns of the society of which the parents are members and the particular traditions and customs of the family itself . General cultural heritage . Some of the cultural elements passed on to children by their families are listed below : ( 1 ) Language . The language given the child is important , for it determines the group with which he will have social contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native language of his footnote00 Ellsworth Faris , " Standpoints and Methods of Sociology in the Study of Personality and Social Growth , " in Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Research in Child Development , Appendix C , 1933 , P. 3. 40 Bronislaw Malinowski , Sex and Repression in Savage Society , Harcourt , Brace , 1927 , p. 217.  | parents will have free social intercourse with that nationality group , but tends to be cut off from contacts in the American group . Language includes not only the spoken word but gestures . The accepted gestures of one group may be abhorrent to members of another cultural group . ( 2 ) Conventions and manners . Conventions and manners are the oil in the machinery of social interaction . The child who knows when to say " Thank you , " when to give his seat to another person , and what to do in the face of an insult , has the technique for finding his way about in his cultural group . The family also teaches the conventions of table manners , toilet habits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) Sex , age , and class roles . The family teaches the child the basic roles for one of his sex , age , and social class . The girl is taught modesty , the boy courage . Roles change from age to age : there is an appropriate age for beginning school , for the first date , for the girl 's first long party dress , for becoming self-supporting . Roles for the children and adolescents of each social class are distinctive . Middle-class families " expect " their children to become self-supporting after they leave high school ; upper-class families expect the sons to become self-supporting after college or professional school , but expect the girls to make an appropriate marriage . These and many other aspects of the roles expected of the children are early taught the child in the family . ( 4 ) Moral precepts and conduct . The family gives the child the basic moral code of the cultural group and the allowable exceptions . It teaches him , for instance , that " honesty is the best policy " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting is permissible only in self-defense. ( 5 ) Use of other institutions . The family gives the child his first introduction to other institutions . The church , the store , the bank , the museum are usually first visited with the parents , who instruct the child by example and admonition in the uses of the institutions and the proper conduct in each . ( 6 ) Family life . Of particular interest is the fact that the family gives the child his conception of family life and of the roles that are appropriate to the various members of the family . First , the family gives  | the child the common mores of our society regarding the family . The child not only experiences the family as a monogamous group but hears severe criticism of anyone who deviates from this pattern . Monogamy comes to seem not only the right way to live but the only natural way . The child experiences the father as head of the family , the mother as manager of the home and supervisor of the children . The boy , by identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of head of the family and is ready for that role when he approaches his own marriage ; moreover , in his father 's absence he is often spoken of as the " head of the family , " as the " little man of the house . " The girl , by identifying herself with her mother , comes to feel that the housewifely role is satisfactory ; in her play with other little girls she assumes the various family roles , the most prized of which is that of the mother . The children learn from the chores assigned to them that certain chores are a " man 's work , " others are " woman 's work " ; the boy mows the lawn , empties the ashes , shovels the snow ? in short , does the outside work ; the girl is given the tasks of dishwashing , dusting , bedmaking , and other household duties . Soon the children believe that it is " natural " for boys and men to perform outdoor tasks requiring physical strength and for the girl to perform the lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in the physical strength of boy and girl . Soon the boy protests if he is asked to do some indoor task ? it is girl 's work , and the girl objects to doing a boy 's work outdoors . The deference shown to the father as head of the family implies superiority of the male , and boys and girls accept this attitude . Girls frequently accept without protest the family decision that their brothers should receive a better education than they , or have more spending money , because they are boys . Thus , through the experience of living in a family of a certain cultural pattern , children learn what family living means in their particular cultural group . They adopt the prevailing attitudes and learn the habits of family living while still very young . Even today in a period of changing social conditions and diverse family patterns , relatively few young people protest against the basic elements of the traditional cultural pattern . Although some of this induction of the child into the culture is  | undertaken deliberately by parents , much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child is included by his parents in their activities . The more completely the child is incorporated into the family group , the more informally and unconsciously he acquires the cultural background . In the typical family , parents do not deliberately set aside certain hours to teach a child honesty or patriotism or courtesy . The child acquires these things incidentally as part of his daily living . He learns to shop by trotting after his parents in the grocery store ; he learns to feel or at least to act reverent when he accompanies his parents to Sunday school or church . Other phases of culture are taught when the parents react negatively to spontaneous behavior that is contrary to the prevailing mores . The child receives his first lesson in respect for private property when he carries home some toy belonging to another child and is forced to return it . The family heritage . In addition to the general cultural heritage , each family has a social heritage of its own , the accumulation of family traditions and attitudes , ways of living and personal relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identity of its own . The family pattern finds expression in such things as the occupations of the members , the place of abode , the relative status of husband and wife , types of recreation , family jokes and nicknames , family rituals , and expressed family ideals and ambitions . Among many families the family pattern is handed down without reflection or self-consciousness . In other families the family is aware of its distinctive pattern , has symbols such as heirlooms , and feels pride in maintaining the pattern , or disappointment if some member deviates . Several examples will make clear the processes involved . The first illustration is of a family pattern passed on without reflection or pride , but readily accepted and justified by later generations . Thomas Jed , who came to a small southern town about sixty years ago , was a ne'er-do-well and a heavy drinker , dependent upon a brother for assistance 41 He married a girl from a closely knit family , with a low income from manual labor , but with a record of self-respect and self-support . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his footnote41 H. W. Gilmore , " Five Generations of a Begging Family , " American journal of Sociology , 1932 , Vol. 37 , pp. 768-775.  | own habits and the pattern of his wife 's family . The children were not well disciplined nor well educated ; they married early . When Jed moved his family to a city , the married children soon followed . At this time the wife 's family refused to give further aid , and the family pattern became influenced greatly by Jed 's way of living . Instead of relying on his wife 's family for help , Jed now turned to relief agencies . The family solidarity characteristic of Mrs. Jed 's family persisted , and when one branch of the family received relief all shared it . The agencies , unable to control the situation , soon refused aid . Jed 's profligate habits led him to begging , and soon the entire family was begging and sharing the proceeds . Now Jed and his wife are dead , but there remain in this one city about fifty people representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family have deviated from the dependency-begging pattern , and they originated in two girls who were taken from the family when very young and reared elsewhere . Thus the family pattern developed by Jed and his wife from the combination of his inadequacies and the solidarity of his wife 's family was passed on from generation to generation . In this transmission of the pattern , a significant factor is that the children from birth have had the status of beggars and have received as part of the family tradition a philosophy to support it ; they might think it wrong to steal or bootleg , but somehow it is right for a Jed to beg . Moreover , the children are equipped only for begging , for they are not given a good education nor taught the skills and habits of regular work . The second illustration is of a rural family pattern perpetuated generation after generation . When the French Canadians first settled in rural Quebec , they established a family pattern suited to the situation , which has been perpetuated for two centuries.42 The families were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the short growing season called for large acreage and many workers . The families tended to be self-sufficient , raising vegetables for their own use , and spinning and weaving cloth for all their needs . According to the division of labor , the men operated the farm and the women ran the household with its numerous industries . The family was organized under footnote42 Horace Miner , " The French-Canadian Family Cycle , " American Sociological Review , 1938 , Vol. 3 , pp. 700-708.  | one head . The father was the head until he became about sixty years of age , when control was given to a son . The son chosen as the father 's successor was not the eldest son but a middle son who was probably in his twenties when the father reached sixty . The family assumed responsibility for establishing the children . Definite patterns for the occupations of the children arose . Usually several were absorbed into farms either by establishing new farms or marrying farmers ; one child typically became a nun or a priest ; several became tradesmen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the discovery of families that had lived on the same land for as many as eight generations with the same family pattern prevailing . At present , the pattern is breaking up ; for the land for expansion is scarce , and as a consequence young people are drifting to the nearby industrial cities . When the family pattern persists long enough , it comes to be supported by a philosophy of life ( as in the Jed family ) ; and when the family pattern is common to a whole community , as among the FrenchCanadian farmers , other social institutions , such as the church , come to support it . If a family has high status in the community and is recognized by the community as being distinctive , both deliberate and unconscious pressure to follow the family pattern is brought to bear upon each member of the family by both family and community . Two published family histories are illustrative of this : Lyman Beecher , who adopted a new family pattern , prevailed upon all his seven sons to become ministers , although it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not well fitted for the career and were reluctant to enter it ; in addition , three of his four daughters followed a feminine version of the ministerial pattern.43 The resistance offered by several sons was broken down by their father 's persistent pressure . One son was not a good student . His father , therefore , himself became this son 's tutor ; and when the son was licensed to preach , his father sat on the committee . Unable to hold any ministry long , this son was helped constantly by the family in finding new positions . Another son , who felt that his father was in a hurry to get all his sons into the ministry , decided to become an organist and musician . When this de- footnote43 L. B. Stowe , Saints , Sinners and Beechers , Bobbs-Merrill , 1934.  | cision disgusted his father , he became a clerk and served as a church organist . At the age of thirty-one , however , he was ordained . A third son had a great interest in science and prepared himself to teach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the age of twenty-eight he yielded to his father 's wish and became a minister . Still another son , who sailed first as a common sailor and later as an officer , said his father was sure to pray him into the ministry ; and after five years he left the seafaring life for the ministry . Other sons prepared for the ministry without an intervening period of protest . Of the four daughters , three married ; but only one played simply a domestic role . Catherine , who did not marry , became a militant educational organizer ; Harriet became a writer , best known for her provocative Uncle Tom 's Cabin ; Isabella became a leader for woman 's suffrage . One and all felt that they were called of God to better social conditions . Vigorous , selfassured , unconventional in their beliefs and methods , they had a strong sense of family unity and family pride . Unfortunately it has not been possible to trace the continuation of the Beecher family pattern through successive generations . The force of the family pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son of Harriet Beecher Stowe . He enlisted in the War between the States to fight for his mother 's beliefs and returned unable to avoid drinking . His mother 's enemies sent her letters berating her for her son 's conduct . Finally he sailed for California , after telling his parents he would not return until he was cured , as he would no longer disgrace the family . In California he disappeared without leaving a trace . Although later generations of the descendants of Lyman Beecher have not followed the ministry , the names of Lyman and Beecher are found among the present living descendants , one hundred fifty years after the birth of Lyman Beecher . Another illustration of family pattern is found in the Adams family , in which the tradition of high-minded public service , first established by John Adams , has continued for five generations 44 Intellectual interests , an aristocratic attitude toward the common people , education at Harvard , prolific writings , and after the second generation a great concern with the past achievements of the Adams family have marked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little , Brown , 1930.  | ily through five generations . In recent generations two opposed trends have appeared : a few members of the family have succeeded in making an adaptation to modern industrial life ; but others , clinging to the Adams family pattern , have been socially maladjusted in a democratic world in which they were unable to serve . The fact that Lyman Beecher and John Adams both started new family patterns has been mentioned . What stimulates a change of pattern ? The Beecher family had been yeomen for many generations , and Lyman 's father and grandfather were both blacksmiths . Although we do not have complete data on the change , we do know that Lyman , unlike his father or brothers , attended Yale at a time when the graduates were almost evenly divided between ministers and lawyers . Converted in his junior year , Lyman decided to become a minister , and thereby raised himself from the class of skilled tradesmen into the professional class . John Adams , son and descendant of farmers , also was the first one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional class . He came into the practice of law at the time that the colonists were in turmoil , preceding the American revolution , and his interest in public affairs crystallized . In these two families at least , the family pattern changed when one member of the family received an education that lifted him into a new social class with a new cultural outlook . In the Adams family the innovation of a new family pattern was related also to a period of rapid social change . The description of the French-Canadian families seems to suggest that unchanging social situations engender unchanging family patterns . Under stable conditions the family pattern becomes highly integrated with the general social pattern and can not change easily unless the entire social pattern changes . Conversely , we would expect to find family patterns changing from generation to generation during periods of rapid social change . The continuity of family pattern is related to the degree of similarity between the family patterns of husband and wife . When two people with similar family patterns marry , the family pattern will be strength ened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a high degree of intermarriage ; the sons of ministers , who themselves became ministers , marrying the daughters of ministers . Thus there  | tended to be a hierarchy of ministers . Calhoun speaks of the " Mather Dynasty , " in which Richard Mather 's second wife was the widow of John Cotton.45 Their children , Increase Mather and Mary Cotton , united and became the parents of Cotton Mather . Richard Mather 's sons , grandsons , and great grandsons entered the ministry , while the daughters of each generation married ministers . Military families also may persist for generations , with at least one son of each generation entering some branch of military service , and the daughters tending to marry men in the service . A newspaper clipping from which the names have been deleted , is illustrative : The name of William , only son of Colonel , has been placed on the current principal list for examination to the United States Military Academy . William has a colorful family military background . Both of his grandfathers were officers in the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental army . His great uncle was Brigadier General . But when people of differing family patterns marry , one pattern may disappear . Thus Lyman Beecher 's first wife had been reared by her grandfather , a general ; and his second wife , although the daughter of a minister , was a member of a family prominent in political affairs ; but it was the family pattern of Lyman Beecher that prevailed . In a period in which the father is dominant , the mother 's family pattern is most likely to disappear . Often the mother will thoroughly identify herself with the family pattern of her husband and help to impress it upon her children . But if the two family patterns are well developed , and both husband and wife have been drilled as children in their respective family patterns , and these are in conflict , the children may feel the force of this conflict as each parent attempts to gain young recruits for his side . Finally , the family pattern may be in conflict with the cultural pattern of the community . This situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definite pattern in one cultural group and then has moved to another cultural group , a situation found when an immigrant family moves into an American neighborhood , or a rural family moves into an urban center . The parents may be able to maintain the old fam- footnote45 A. W. Calhoun , A Social History of the American Family from Colonial Times to the ! ' resent , Clark , 1917 , Vol. 1 , pp. 78-79.  | ily traditions , but the children are often torn between the traditions of the family and those of the community . To the extent that one family tradition prevails , the unity of the fam- t ily is strengthened . One of the weaknesses of the urban family is that it has little family tradition . Usually the family consists of parents and children separated by many miles from grandparents and other older relatives who would help to implant family traditions and family pride in the children . Frequent moving means that many material symbols of family tradition are lost ; bulky heirlooms that would find a place in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid change of urban life places emphasis on the present and the future ; the past tends to be discarded as of little value . This very unity of family life , when based on the traditions of a past generation , may interfere with adaptability of the family or of its members to new conditions . Changing conditions call for changes in family pattern , and a too rigid adherence to the family traditions in the midst of social change is likely to cause maladjustment . In a sense this was true of some members of the famous Adams family . The first few generations after John Adams functioned actively in the social life of their times ; later generations became absorbed in the past , editing the letters and journals of the earlier generations , fumbling for a way to uphold the high standards of public service set by past generations at a time when the democracy of the times prevented the aristocratic Adams family from gaining public support . The family tradition is very important in giving the child his conception of himself and the essential roles he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If two lines of tradition , personified by the two parents , are struggling for supremacy , the child may attempt to play two incompatible roles as he strives for the approval of both parents ; or he may select the traditions of one parent and reject those of the other , in which case he may achieve an integrated personality but with the loss of a close relationship with one parent . If the family has one closely held traditional pattern in which it takes great pride , the child will tend to accept this , as the pressures of family approval upon the child are very great . If , however , this tradition is deeply rooted in the past , the child may emerge with an inflexible personality unsuited to present-day  | social conditions . If , as in many urban families , there is little sense of any family tradition , the child tends to seek the immediate approval of his parents for the passing acts of the day , but does not develop a deep sense of family continuity ; he is perhaps best able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adaptability , but he may lose his feeling of unity with a continuing primary group and struggle against a feeling of insecurity , which comes with too great individualism.4 " The techniques by which the family heritage is transmitted to the child may be unconsciously applied or deliberately planned . In families like those of Jed or the French-Canadian farmers , the children acquire the family pattern simply by living the pattern and absorbing family customs and related personal habits . Among families with a consciousness of family status that must be maintained , the transmission of the family heritage becomes more conscious and deliberate . If the child is thought of as destined from birth for a particular role in the family system , his life is fashioned to this role from babyhood on . The child who is to follow his father 's and grandfather 's footsteps as a minister is told of the achievements of ministerial grandparents ; he is early inducted into church duties ; he is introduced to strangers as the successor of his father ; his future profession is spoken of as an accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son , even when an adult , to evade the family pattern without tremendous inner conflict or a definite break with his family . DECREASE OF FAMILY INFLUENCE Emphasis has been placed upon the influence of the family in the personality development of children . But the family 's influence is less inclusive than was formerly true . Any family that wished might assign much of the care of a child to other institutions . The child might be horn in a hospital , reared at home under the close supervision of a pediatrician , enter nursery school at the age of two and spend seven or eight footnote46 See E. W. Burgess , " Family Tradition and Personality , " in Kimball Young , editor , Social Attitudes , Holt , 1931 , pp. 188-207 , for additional cases showing the effect of family tradition upon personality development , and for pertinent questions for further study of family tradition .  | hours a day there , enter kindergarten at four and school at six ; Sunday morning might be spent at Sunday school and Sunday afternoon at a supervised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lakeside camp from the age of three on ; at the age of seven or eight the child could join the Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts , begin piano lessons , attend dancing class , art class , dramatics class . The child would still sleep at home except when in camp and would probably eat breakfast and dinner at home , although luncheon from the age of two on might be eaten at school . The parents would select the institutions or teachers who would supervise their children 's education and training , but would not themselves train their children . The intrusion of other institutions into child training does violence to our prejudices partly because the shift has come so rapidly with so many institutions claiming part of the child 's time and attention , and partly because in our immediate past lies the pioneer family , self-sufficient through necessity . The rationalization for the intrusion of outside institutions is the claim by many institutions that they have specially trained personnel which can give the child expert care or expert training in a particular field . The parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may be a specialist only in some one field . But obviously one parent could scarcely be doctor , nurse , child psychologist , recreation specialist , music teacher , and so on down the list . In this dispersion of the child 's time and attention to many other institutions , the parents still retain several important functions . The child 's contacts in outside institutions tend to be impersonal in character ; the child knows his club leader as Mr. Smith , not as father or uncle ; he knows him only as club leader . The home is still the intimate group ; the parents , brothers , and sisters are still the personal companions . Plant emphasizes the emotional need of the child for these personal relationships , where he is accepted for what he is rather than for what he does 4i In the family the child " belongs " by reason of birth and the sense of " belongingness " is important to his feeling of security . Faris points out that not all families have a close feeling of unity , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributes to fine personality footnote47 Plant , op. cit. , chap . 5.  | development in children.4 He emphasizes the need of children for inclusion in some small , intimate group which ideally should be the family . Only in such a group , Faris says , does the child develop essentially human qualities and a conception of his personal role . The family serves a definite function also in orientating the child . Outside contacts tend to be segmental and diverse , perhaps even conflicting . Each institution covers a limited activity ; each demands that the child adjust to a new personnel and a new set of rules ; each inculcates its own distinctive philosophy and rules . Some institutions claim the child for only a few hours a week , attempting in the limited time to impress upon the child a particular philosophy . Others , such as the school , direct the child 's activities for many hours of the day , but have long vacations . Moreover , the leadership in these institutions changes from year to year so that the child can not make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the many institutions seek to impress their respective cultures and their respective philosophies upon the child , while the child has the task of orienting himself with respect to the many points of view and many habits . Out of the medley of experiences he must try to build an integrated philosophy of life and a consistent set of personal habits . Among all the institutions , the family still remains the one group which claims the child year in and year out , without vacation , and the parents are still the only two adults responsible for a child or a limited number of children in all phases of their development . If the child responds to all the conflicting outside influences and yet emerges a well-integrated person , it is usually because year after year the one stable group , the family , has helped him to interpret his experiences .

Federal laws and such efforts of the elderly as the Townsend Movement have drawn attention to one problem of older people ? lack of economic security . Other problems are only beginning to be recognized . GROWING NUMERICAL IMPORTANCE OF OLDER PEOPLE For more than a century the proportion of older people in the population has been increasing . This is caused by the decline in the birthrate . The decline is most clearly shown by changes in the ratio of young children to women of the child-bearing ages for successive decades . In 1800 there were i000 children four years old or under to every i000 women between the ages of sixteen and forty-four . By 1850 the number of children had fallen to 69o ; by 1900 , to 531 . A further decline brought the number of children under age five per moo women of childbearing age to 407 in 1930.1 This steady decrease will continue unless there is a permanent increase in birthrate or a great and continuous influx of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either footnote1 W. S. Thompson , Population Problems , McGraw-Hill , 1935 , p. 244.  | of these things will happen . The actual percentage distribution by age of the population in the United States for 1930 is given below and the projected distribution for 198o , at which time the population distribution is expected to have become more or less stationary : 2 figure The percentage distribution for 1980 shows the probable proportion of old people to young people at the time that college students of the present are nearing their sixties . In comparing the age distributions for 1930 and 198o , it should be noted that the percentage of people thirty to forty-four years of age is almost the same at both periods . But younger people will form a much smaller proportion of the population and older people a much larger proportion in 1980 than they did in 1930 . The decreased number of children may cause an intensified interest in their welfare , because each child will seem more precious to its parents and to the community ; but older people , by their greatly increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age levels , will become a more dominant and influential group than they are at present . Since this shifting in propori ion has already become noticeable , the family problems of middle-aged and elderly persons merit attention . ADJUSTMENT TO MATURING CHILDREN The birth of children and the adjustment of husband and wife to the roles of father and mother have been treated as one of the critical episodes in the life of the individual family . Usually , after children have been incorporated into the family life , and a pattern of interaction between parents and children has been established , no marked change footnote2 Thompson , op. cit. , p. 267.  | occurs in this relationship until , simultaneously , the children reach adolescence and the parents reach middle age . As children mature , they tend to leave the parental family . The number of young persons who attend college is increasing steadily ; many others leave their families and go from farm or small town to the city to work ; some who live in the city leave the parental home to live in small furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for the first time when they marry . Even when children do not leave the home , they break away psychologically . This psychological withdrawal may precede actual physical departure , for it often comes during the adolescent years . The trend of the times has been toward greater independence for young people , a trend supported by psychiatrists and psychologists who see , in prolonged dependence of the child upon the parents , the seeds of future immaturity . " Psychological weaning " is one striking term used to indicate the process by which the adolescent frees himself from childish dependence upon , or dominance by , his family.3 " Psychological coming of age " is another term.4 Many volumes and articles have been written about the adjustment problems of adolescents in their attempts to gain emotional independence . Only fragmentary is the material on the complementary adjustment problems of the parents . The adjustments of maturing youth and the adjustments of their parents are part of the same process .

The situations in some families are given in the following excerpts from family narratives written by young persons . ' The parents of a young woman in a large university still regard her as a child : At times my parents regard me as a child . They constantly worry when I am out after dark , and are often unwilling to let me go out , especially when I am alone . They still think my opinions decidedly inferior to theirs upon footnoteUsed by Leta Hollingworth , The Psychology of the Adolescent , D.

This naturally does not lead to much conversation on my part and if they wonder why I do not talk more at home they should be able to figure it out , but they do n't try . Of course I can not tell them . I am perfectly able to take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable in a practical way . Another young woman in her early twenties lived at home after four years spent away from home in college . She was employed and selfsupporting . She found , however , that her parents maintained the protective attitude that they had held toward her during her childhood . They objected when she wished to buy an automobile , although her younger brother owned one . They cautioned her about staying out late at night , reminded her to pack her toothbrush when she was going away for a visit , and in other ways hedged her about with their fears . " They seem to forget , " the girl concluded , " that for four years in college I managed my own life and made my own decisions . " A third girl voiced her objections : The thing that I object to now about my parents ' action toward me is that they still think of me as their baby . They do not realize that I am twenty years old and should be able to plan for myself and take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to advise and suggest , but I do n't like to be told . The typical attitude of the young person who is too long restrained in his search for independence is impatience or rebellion . The attitude of the parent is fear and grief ? fear that the child will come to some harm , and grief over the loss of the childish dependence . Staying up at night until son or daughter comes home ; crying when the daughter remains out later than usual ; insisting that the daughter give her earnings to the mother , who then buys the daughter 's clothing and doles out her lunch money ? all are indicative of fear on the part of the parent . The homesick adolescent on his first absence from home has often been described in detail . The parent of such a youth is just as likely to be emotionally upset over the absence . Parents have been known to make almost daily long-distance calls to sons or daughters in college to give them minute advice on small daily affairs . Other parents de ! nand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in milder degree , that they might show at the death of a child .  | In contrast to these situations is the relationship between parent and son or daughter when the youth has been allowed to obtain his independence . The following excerpts were written by young persons and reflect the family relationships . A girl writes : Since my parents are very old they have never cared to do any of the things I would enjoy , such as travelling , shows , plays , and music . I feel that I have missed a lot in life for that reason . They have always arranged , however , for me to attend concerts and shows , but not in their company . Each person in our family has been allowed to go his own way . My parents directed my life instead of leading it . I sometimes wonder how I missed some of the very dangerous pitfalls ? it must have been because of their tactful direction . I have been independent for I have had a car to drive ever since I developed the craving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine my self-confidence . I have always been open in what I do . If I did n't tell my intentions , I told my parents what I had done afterward . Their approval meant much to me ; their disapproval humiliated me and made me feel terrible . My parents regard me as quite grown up , independent , and able to take care of myself and make my own decisions ; in fact , they depend upon me to do it . A young man describes the process of growing up in his family : My parents never did push any one of us but they were always ready to encourage and help us boys do things . I do n't believe any of us were spoiled . We were all instructed early in money matters and each one of us had a savings account in the bank . There is no doubt that there is a strong affection between us but it is shown very , little in outward actions . I always have talked over my problems pretty frankly with both my father and mother ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me since I was a youngster to do things on my own initiative . Since I was fourteen I have bought my own clothes and , when home , have made arrangements to pay in some way for my room , board , and laundry . Parents often are confused because the issue of adolescent independence is not an unequivocal one . Long years of vocational and professional training often postpone financial independence for young people . Yet financial independence is regarded as the hallmark of maturity . Parents find it difficult to realize that , although the son or daughter may be still dependent economically upon the family and may not have completed his or her schooling , nevertheless the youth is biologically ma-  | ture , psychologically capable as an adult , and sociologically competent . Adjustment of the mother . The adjustment that the mother must make when her children mature may be very difficult . The period of relinquishment has been called a " second birth , " an experience as painful psychologically as the original birth was physically.6 For years the mother has watched over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided them . It is difficult for her to realize that at the age of sixteen or seventeen they no longer need or want her full protection . If the mother tries to force her protection on her children , however gently , they are likely to rebel . The rebellion may be open and may lead to active conflict between the mother and her son or daughter . Or the rebellion may be concealed and take the form of secret evasions of the mother 's wishes . Or the older youth may find it convenient to go to some other city to work , to achieve independence . At the same time the youth often seems to need the protection of his mother even while he rebels against it . Levy and Munroe state that the child 's rebellion is really against his baby self and that until he achieves maturity he must have parental protection even while he fights to free himself from it . ' Eventually he will be strong enough to be independent of his parents , and then the parents ? and especially the mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making the adjustment to maturing children is that their role as mother is likely to end abruptly . In the present-day family with one or two children , maternal responsibilities do not taper off gradually as they did formerly , in families with four or more children ; the maternal role must be laid aside when the mother is still vigorous and young and not yet ready to accept the easy chair by the fireside . When many children have been born into the family , the mother may not be called upon to relinquish her maternal role until she is fifty-five or sixty years old . She may then welcome a less arduous life ; or she may be able to assume the role of grandmother to the children of her elder sons and daughters . But the modern woman may find herself without the maternal role at the age of forty or fortyfive , still eager for activity , and without younger children to divert her footnote6 John Levy and Ruth Munroe , The Happy Family , Knopf , 1940 , chap . i. 7 Levy and Munroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention from the one or two maturing children who are seeking their independence . The intensity with which the mother has played the maternal role is important in her adjustment . If she has accepted this role fully and has given only scant attention to others such as those of clubwoman , board member , employed woman , she may find herself without any substitute role to play . In her absorption in her family she may have lost contacts with groups earlier known ; though once she may have worked , she has probably lost her earlier skills . In her devotion to her children she may even have lost to some degree the role of wife , and her husband may have found companionship in male friends or may have diverted his attention to some club or hobby . On the other hand , the woman who maintained several roles throughout the childhood of her children , even though in incipient form , is in a position to develop one of these roles more completely as the maternal role declines in importance . Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt affords striking example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enlarged , or allowed to decline , as the years pass . When her brood was young , her chief role was that of mother , with public and social problems holding a minor place in her interests . As her children matured and left to form families of their own , her maternal role declined but never disappeared , and her role as a leader in public and social movements expanded . Her primary role became that of the lay woman with a definite interest and leadership in social movements ; her minor role , the maternal one , evident in her visits to her children , her assembling of grandchildren for holidays , and her reported delight in each new grandchild.8 Occasionally when the mother refuses to relinquish the maternal role , the son or daughter is unable , unaided , to achieve a mature role and independence from the parent . These are the over-protected or the dominated children , grown to maturity in years but not in emotional independence from their parents . The mother may maintain a leech-like clutch upon the son or daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case excerpts are illustrative : In the L. family the older sons had married before the death of the father and the complete affection of the widowed mother centered upon a younger , footnote8 Eleanor Roosevelt , This Is My Story , Harper , 1937.  | unmarried son . She played the role of both mother and sweetheart to her son , accompanying him on social affairs held by young people of his own age . So strong was her hold and so reluctant was she to release it that the son was unable to leave her to accept a position in another state . Finally he fell in love , but his mother refused to acknowledge the girl 's existence . Eventually he released himself by committing suicide , but in such a manner that the mother was able to believe his death was accidental . In the X family the widowed mother was so completely attached to her son that she became a rival of her son 's wife . The wife obtained a divorce and after an interval the son remarried . His mother accompanied him and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips . In these cases of the widowed mother there is a dual problem ; for the mother has probably identified the son with her husband and finds in her association with him not only maternal but also a vicarious wifely satisfaction . The mother thus becomes the competitor of the wife , if the son marries . Mothers may be more successful in keeping the daughter in a subordinate position , as the girl may be less inclined than the son to take independence when it is not freely given . Many of the mother 's practices may hint of dominance , but often they conceal an underlying fear that with the loss of the protective maternal role will come an empty and meaningless life . Adjustment of the father . Usually the adjustment that the father makes when children withdraw from the family is relatively painless . The father 's role in our society is primarily that of over-all supervisor and earner for the family . When his son or daughter enters college he may find that he has to restrict certain expenditures , and when the son begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has more money to spend or save . He may miss his children in the evenings and on Sundays ; but essentially his role does not change . Nevertheless , occasionally the father remains closely attached to a mature child . In the following instance the father 's only emotional outlet was his son , and neither he nor his son had visualized any need for independence on the part of the son : H. was a lawyer of brilliant promise who had not been successful in his later years . After the death of his wife when their son was a small child , he  | devoted himself to the child , taking the role of both father and mother . The son was closely attached to the father and when he entered college followed a law course . He was to accomplish what his father had hoped for himself but had been unable to achieve . Before the son had been graduated he died . The father 's statement soon after the son died follows : " Since my son died I have received many letters of appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a fine boy I had but I did n't know all those men knew it . He would have begun the practice of law next year and we were so happy that we would be near each other . I am all alone now . We had spoken of the possibility of one of us going but I thought I would be the one to go and he would live on and carry out my ideals . When I read these letters it seems as though I could not let him go but must reach out and draw him back . He was all I had . I suppose it was a more beautiful relationship than most people have had but it is very hard now . I am all alone and I am old . Everything must be changed now and it is hard to change . " PHYSICAL ADJUSTMENT The adolescent must adjust to the advent of sexual maturity and desire , and learn to control and guide it ; the middle-aged man and woman must adjust to the diminution of sexual desires and powers . Sometime during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period during which she loses the capacity to bear children . The cessation of sexual functions is gradual and may extend over a number of months . The process may be accompanied by various physical disturbances , periods of nervousness , or , occasionally , definite neurotic or psychotic symptoms . It is a temporary phase of life , however ; and after it passes the woman normally regains her poise . The man loses his sexual powers more gradually , and the age of complete cessation of sexual virility varies . Some men of seventy are able to sire children . The loss of sexual powers necessitates psychological adjustments , because of the attitudes people have toward those powers . If the wife has played the traditional maternal role with status proportionate to her ability to bear children , the loss of this ability may disturb her . Or if she has wanted children and not had them , realization that she can not have them may cause extreme distress . However , with the small number of children customary today , many women have passed their child-bearing period for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to produce children . The period of change may still be difficult for such a woman , if she has identified sexual attraction with youthful charm and feels that now her youth is ended and with it her attractiveness to her husband or , indirectly , to other men . Much of the adjustment of the forties for women seems to be mental and to be related to the above attitudes . For men also , an adjustment to diminished sexual powers must be made . Since the change comes more gradually for the man than for the woman , the crisis is less acute . But , since sexual abilities are often associated with virility and strength in popular thinking , the diminishing of these powers may symbolize for the man a general loss of vitality and ability . Hence , the middle-aged man may fear that he is not attaining his earlier accomplishments in other fields and may try to demonstrate his ability by unwise or rash business moves . In personal relations he may try to prove his continued youth by an alliance with a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued virility and attractiveness . PRECEDING ROLES AS DETERMINANTS The effect of these physical changes of middle age upon the intrafamilial relationships is not predetermined ; it is linked to the interlocked roles that husband and wife have built up during the preceding years of marriage . If we accept Kirkpatrick 's classification of roles as a starting point , we have three relationships between wife and husband : the traditional maternal-paternal roles ; the companion roles ; and the partnership roles.9 When the parental roles have dominated husband and wife for many years , they often feel deeply the loss of their children as son or daughter marries or leaves home for college or to work in some other city . Even in cases of only normally close attachment , the departure of children leaves a gap in the family . The husband and wife , whose primary roles have been those of parents , may try to find substitutes ? a pet ; a neighbor 's child ; in time , a grandchild . They continue to call each other " Father " and " Mother . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis- footnote ? See pp. 18o-181.  | play , her children 's baby clothes and audibly wish her children were babies again . These parents with a common interest in their children are likely to slip into a placid and companionable middle and old age . The companion role of the wife is based upon youth and physical attractiveness and has for its complement the proud and indulgent husband . The companion role calls for continuous competition with other women . If the wife maintains the companion role into middle age , she may then strive too hard for youth and beauty . The dresses and hats that she wears may be a shade too youthful ; lipstick and nail pol h a bit too gay ; tone and manners may become kittenish . The husband , visualizing himself as young and virile , but seeing his wife more objectively , may find his wife less and less satisfying as an object of pride and may tend to give attention to younger women . Or , as the years pass and other interests claim his attention , he may give his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure on her part and which may cause her to redouble her efforts to remain youthful and again arouse his admiration . Other women , to compete with younger rivals , may adopt the role of the experienced woman of the world , with dashing but not too youthful clothes and slightly risque stories . Whatever the technique involved , the woman often suffers from a sense of insecurity and consequently slightly overdoes her efforts to meet youthful competition . The partnership role of the wife is perhaps less affected by middle age than are the other roles , at least so far as the husband-wife relationships are directly concerned . But the wife who works , and shares in the expenses of the family , may suffer the fears of loss of competence that sometimes afflict the middle-aged man . Both husband and wife may be afraid to take vacations lest some younger persons usurp their positions while they are absent ; they may scrimp and save with the fear of old age ahead of them . Thus each accentuates the other 's fears . In other situations the dual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement for both and entrance upon a life of comparative leisure . THE LATER YEARS OF MARRIED LIFE No definite age marks the dividing line between middle and old age . But a transition occurs , easily recognizable , after which the person is  | considered past the full powers of adulthood and unable to compete with younger people . The problems of adjustment of husband and wife to middle age and to old age differ . Whereas middle age involves adjustment to the loss of youth and to the emancipation of children , old age seems to call for adjustment to loss of social status and to economic dependency . Loss of status . The loss of the old , honored role for elderly people may be accounted for in several ways . Change is the keynote of all types of social organization at present . Occupations , industrial operations , political organization , types of recreation , religion , philanthropy , and many other phases of social life are changing rapidly . People become adjusted to the social organization of their youth and often are unable to keep pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old people may decry Sunday golf , chain stores , the freedom of young people , labor unions , and the like . Therefore , often they lose their capacity for leadership of younger people within the family as without . Elderly parents and grandparents are termed " out of date , " " old-fashioned , " " back numbers , " by their younger children and their grandchildren . Their wisdom , accumulated over the years , is of little use to those facing the world of today , for it is wisdom gained in a different social world.10 The loss of respect formerly shown elderly people may be laid , in part , to the rapid change in values . This change is especially evident in the occupational field . When men earned their living by the skill of their hands , on the farm or in the shop , in independent enterprise , the elderly person could maintain himself into old age , even though at a reduced output of production . Also , he could serve as teacher of younger people . But today the emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical speed of reaction and endurance are at a premium . When a man begins to decline in speed he is cast off , except in times of emergency when greatly increased production causes a temporary absorption of elderly but less efficient workers . Workers themselves protest the process ; unions struggle to get special privileges for " seniority . " Nevertheless , the person who is valued and who earns the most is the footnote10 The attempt on the part of President Roosevelt to replace elderly Justices of the Supreme Court with younger men is symptomatic of the times . Able thinkers , the elderly justices nevertheless adhered to the traditions of a passing period .  | young man who can produce the most . Thus it is the young who become the leaders in families and in communities . Again , the trend is away from family status toward individual status . Each person seeks to find his role and to hold it by his own efforts , rather than because of his position in the family hierarchy . With the present emphasis on wages , the leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most money , and this one frequently is not the eldest member of the family group . Also , the parents tend to lose their traditional role because today society encourages mobility from class to class , and children often climb into a higher social class than that of their parents . They may love their parents and treat them with deference , but they are not guided by their advice . Because of these conditions many elderly people find themselves adrift . Economic position of elderly people . When the dominant occupational pattern of the country was agricultural , with handicraft , often it was not necessary for a man to retire at all . A son might inherit the farm or the shop while the father still lived , and the son might gradually increase his responsibility as the powers of the father declined . But the father always had a stake in the land or the shop and was entitled to a livelihood from it even though he could give only a small return in work . This still is the accepted custom among the French-Canadian farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artisans who owned their own shops and trained their own sons . The writer knows of one family which has owned and managed a tinshop through five generations , in a small eastern town . A son or son-in-law enters the shop , knowing that in time he will own the shop ; he learns the business from the father , and by the time the father is no longer able to carry the major responsibility the son has become competent to assume management of the business . The father continues to do whatever work he can and until his death receives as his right support from the income of the shop . If he dies , his widow is entitled to support . In this particular family , the custom still continues . In these instances the farm or the business does not belong to an individual so much as to the family . The elderly members of the footnote11 See pp. 235-236.  | family do not retire , and they are not discharged because they are unable to compete with younger men . Employment in a factory for wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as factory production has grown and the urban trend has become intensified . With few exceptions , the worker is divorced from all ownership in the factory for which he works ; he has no " right " to receive support until his death . The employer ( as employer ) is not interested in him as a human being , but only in the amount of work he can produce . When he can no longer produce as much as a younger man , he is discharged . Unfortunately , the wages paid in most industries and in some professions do not permit savings sufficient to carry the man and his wife through old age . A report by Brookings Institute shows that in 1929 ( prior to the depression ) almost half of the gainfully employed people in the country , excluding farmers , were receiving less than $1,000 per year.12 During the 1930 's men were discharged at forty-five or fifty , and this period has been referred to as the beginning of " economic old age . " At the beginning of the 1940 's men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increased production incident to the war and because of the withdrawal of young men into the army . But war must be regarded as a temporary crisis , after which resumption of the old trend is to be expected . Deprived of work and without savings , the man who is regarded by industry as too old has several alternatives . He may seek some less exacting work , perhaps within his own plant ; perhaps he becomes an elevator operator or a watchman . He may become dependent upon his children , other relatives , or some charitable or public agency . Only recently has another alternative been offered ? payments from company pensions and Old Age Benefits Insurance established under the Social Security Act . The traditional pattern was for the man to continue to work at anything he might find to do until he could work no longer , after which his children or other relatives absorbed him into their family . Care of the aged was distinctly a family problem . When a family farm or fam- footnote12 The Social Security Act , What It Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Board , Washington , D. C. , no date .  | ily business was owned , such absorption was accepted as normal . In fact , a sharp change rarely was necessary , for the entire family of two or three generations often lived under one roof or in neighboring houses . But with the factory system and the increased mobility of modern times , the large-family group began to disappear . Each husband and wife and their minor children formed an independent family unit , often widely separated . After the children had all married and founded homes of their own , the father and mother were left alone . They might be a thousand miles from their nearest son or daughter . Fewer and fewer families had family businesses ; more and more were dependent upon wages , and these wages usually were adequate only for the immediate family group of husband , wife , and minor children . So the son or daughter , even though willing to aid the parents , often was not economically in a position to aid them adequately without tremendous sacrifices on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption of the elderly father and mother into the household of a married child often meant , for the old people , moving into a new part of the country , leaving old friends , selling furniture to which many sentiments were attached . A complete destruction of their accustomed life organization was often necessary . Care of the aged changed from a family problem possible of solution into a family catastrophe . The depression of the early 1930 's tended to bring the economic problems of old people to a head . Even before the depression started , it was estimated that one third of all people sixty-five years of age and over had to depend on others for their support.13 Three forms of public aid were provided : ( I ) Old Age Assistance , which was devised to help the " needy aged . " The funds are supplied by the federal government and by the state and are assigned to people sixty-five years of age and over on the basis of need ; Old Age Assistance is therefore a form of public relief . ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age sixty-five from funds collected by the government from wages and from employers during the years that the worker is employed . Both of these provisions are of assistance only after the age of sixty-five has been reached . ( 3 ) The Work Projects Administration ( WPA ) , which is the present public work-relief agency for which elderly people are eligible . footnote13 The Social Security Act , What It Is and What It Does , op. cit. , p. x.  | Acceptance for work relief requires that the person should be able to work , although many elderly persons are accepted who are no longer able to maintain high speeds and who would be unable to compete with younger workers in a modern factory or office . The Old Age Assistance program was immediately popular . It was presented as a " pension " system ? as the rightful reward of every needy old person for a long life of usefulness . In 1935 , just before the Old Age Assistance program went into operation , 400,000 old people were receiving state or local public aid ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1940 , 1,973,513 persons were receiving Old Age Assistance . This amounted to 25 per cent of all people sixty-five years of age or over . The percentage varied from state to state ; for instance , in 1937 , only 5.3 per cent of the old people in Tennessee were receiving assistance as compared with 59.0 per cent of the old people in Oklahoma . In addition to recipients of Old Age Assistance , 145,000 persons were receiving payments under the Old Age Benefits Insurance plan ; and others were working on WPA.14 The payments under the various plans are not large . In 1937 , although the federal government provided for a possible maximum of $30 a month to the recipients of Old Age Assistance , the average payment was $18.52 for July of that year.15 In 1940 , with a possible maximum of $85 per month , the average payment under the Old Age and Survivor 's Insurance was $36 to a husband and wife and $22.50 to a surviving widow . " These payments often are much smaller than the elderly person or couple has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living . On the other hand , the payments , small though they are , give independence to many old persons who live alone and give status and financial importance to those who live with relatives . The payments are most inadequate when the recipient is chronically ill or during a period of acute illness . A recent National Health Survey showed that 53.3 per 1,000 of the population 65 ? 74 years of age and over , footnote14 " Old Age Assistance , " Social Work Year Book , Russell Sage Foundation , 1941 , pp. 387 ? 394 ; " Old Age and Survivor 's Insurance , " ibid. , p. 384 ; Public Assistance Statistics for the United States , Oct. , 1937 , Vol. 2 , Nos. 10 ? 12 , Social Security Board , Washington , P. 13 , 15 The Social Security Act , What It Is and What It Does , op. cit. , p. 8. 16 " Old Age and Survivor 's Insurance , " op. cit. , p. 384.  | and 72.7 per 1,000 of the population 75 ? 84 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the payments in relation to needs , there are several other deficiencies in the federal provisions . The Old Age Assistance is administered by the state , and at least half of the funds are provided by the state . If the state does not provide funds up to the maximum that will be matched by the federal government , the federal funds are reduced in amount , and payments are small . The law provides that five of the last nine years must have been spent in the state in which the old person expects to receive the assistance and that the year preceding the date when application is made must have been spent in the state . Old people without a permanent residence are therefore handicapped . The requirement works a hardship also upon elderly people who have been accepted for assistance in one state and who later because of ill health and the need for supervision ar nursing find it necessary to go to live with a son or a daughter in another state . The old age assistance is not granted in the second state until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age Benefits Insurance also has certain limitations , in that people employed in the following fields are not included in the plan : agricultural workers , domestic labor , casual labor , crewvnf vessels documented under the laws.of the United States or foreign countries , government employees , and employees of non-profit organizations . Living conditions of elderly people . During the early and middleadult years 82 per cent of all people are married and living with husband or wife . But with the approach of old age , death breaks into marriages with increasing frequency . A few of the widows and some of the widowers remarry ; nevertheless , more than one fifth of all men between the ages of sixty-five and seventy-four are widowed and unmarried and fully half of the women of the same age range are widowed and unmarried . Among women who are seventy-five and over , three fourths are widowed and unmarried . Table 7 , page 163 , gives the marital status of the older age groups . The figures show clearly the probability of a lonely old age as widow or widower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6o per cent of footnote17 " Old Age , " Social Work Year Book , op. cit. , p. 380.  | the women and 28 per cent of the men were widowed ; 28 per cent of the women and 53 per cent of the men were married ; 12 per cent of the women and 19 per cent of the men were unmarried or divorced.18 Of the total group receiving Old Age Assistance , only one fifth were living alone ; four fifths lived with the spouse , relatives , or friends . Single women are more likely to be cared for by relatives and friends than are single men ; married couples are less likely to receive such care than are the single , widowed , or divorced persons . Whether the old people are receiving public assistance or not , three general patterns of living arrangements appear : the old person lives alone ; the old person lives with relatives ; the old person and spouse live together . Each arrangement has its own problems , peculiar to the elderly . Underlying all three arrangements are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems of increased leisure , which will be discussed in a later section . The old person who lives alone may never have been married , and his pattern of living alone may be simply the continuation of an earlier pattern ; but more often it is the result of widowhood and the customary process by which children leave home to work or to establish homes of their own . These lone old people often are restless and unhappy . Visitors for Old Age Assistance offices state that they have difficulty in keeping track of the location of their clients , as the old people move so often from one furnished room to another . Other old persons alternate beween a season in some public or private institution for the aged and a period in a rooming house , never quite able to adjust to either situation . As these people grow older , they become less and less able to care adequately for themselves . Many have no relatives to care for them or are reluctant to enter the homes of relatives . Many who formerly would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now enabled by Old Age Assistance or Old Age Benefits Insurance to remain economically independent . Consequently , many private boarding homes have sprung up where these old people may live and perhaps receive some care in case of illness . These homes are unsupervised and often give inadequate care and food . One writer has advocated " foster homes for the aged , " or supervised boarding homes for the aged , similar footnote18 " Old Age Assistance , " Social Work Year Book , op ; cit. , pp. 387-394.  | to those provided in some states for dependent children.19 These should be licensed and inspected periodically . The writer suggests the following as essential points to be observed in establishing such homes . 1 . The home should be a family home . 2 . There should be not more than four roomers who are over sixty-five years old . 3 . The family should be self-sustaining ? that is , not dependent on relief funds . 4 . The home should be near a park or open space . 5 . The home should be accessible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family should be accustomed to older people . 7 . There should be no children under sixteen in the family . 8 . Family members should be in sound health . 9 . The woman head of the family should be capable and have a pleasing personality . 1o . The house should conform to the local fire and sanitary regulations . r r . There should be adequate heat . 12 . The toilet should be on the same floor as the rooms . 13 . Rooms for the old persons should not be above the second floor unless there is an elevator . 14 . Each old person should have a room to himself . 15 . Rooms should be comfortable and clean . 16 . Special diets should be provided when needed . 17 . Provision for medical and nursing care should be worked out jointly by the old person , the family , and the supervising agency . 18 . Financial arrangements should be made in writing between the family and the old person . Occasionally the lone old person is able to maintain his own home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps more often she , then attempts to continue to carry responsibilities for which he is no longer economically or physically capable . Old people are found who pay half or more of their small income for rent , to continue a semblance of the standard of living possible in younger days when income was larger . They are unable to part with familiar furniture or to reduce the physical surroundings from five or six to one or two rooms . " Home " to these old persons means a certain physical layout . Others who are perhaps able to maintain their homes become recluses as their physical strength footnote19 N. L. Austin , " Old Folks Without Homes , " Survey Midmonthly , 1939 , Vol. 95 , pp . Q-II . THE COURSE OF FAMILY LIFE  | fails . They shut themselves in , perhaps with some pet or pets for company . They refuse to have anyone come in even for one day a week to clean the house . " I do n't want outsiders in my home , " is the answer to the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old person . These people have lost their flexibility and are unable to adjust to a new way of living . Although in popular thinking there is something fine in the willingness of son or daughter to include an elderly parent in the family group , the parents who must accept such invitations often have the most drastic and uncomfortable adjustments to make . The lone person within certain limitations may choose his residence and his room ; he maintains his independence of expenditures and actions ; he may come and go as he pleases . The old person who goes to live with son or daughter gives up a large part of his independence , both economically and in freedom of activity . The joining of two generations because of the financial need of the elder is especially difficult if for a time the two generations have been separated . Such separation permits the younger couple to develop their individual familial folkways and mores , which may be very different from those of their parents . The points of difference and of potential conflict are many . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm or in a small village and has moved to a city to live . Marriage in the city follows , and a pattern and tempo in keeping with city life are established . If , then , the parents come from the rural background to live with the son or daughter they face not only the adjustment to a new situation , the loss of old friends , the acceptance of a subordinate status in the combined family , but also family habits that may seem to them not only strange but wrong . When there are grandchildren who have departed still further from the rural pattern , the disapproval may become intense . Conflict may center , not around contrast of rural and urban mores , but around differences in educational standards . The great increase in the number of college graduates during the past generation means that many college graduates following managerial or professional occupations have parents with only high school or even grade school education . It is said that the typical American who has gone to college has  | a father who went only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Each generation tends to climb one rung higher on the educational ladder , and eventually the new generation passes into a higher social class . Thus the parents may be members of the lowermiddle class socially , with simple tastes and limited interests ; their sons and daughters may have climbed into the upper class with wide cultural and intellectual interests and a degree of social sophistication that makes them strangers to their parents . To bring the two generations together under one roof makes adjustment exceedingly difficult . Sometimes the differences center around religious beliefs : parents trained in strict religious denominations to regard card playing , dancing , and motion pictures as tools of the Devil will be deeply shocked and profoundly disturbed when they find their son or daughter , trained as a child in the same beliefs , freely indulging in the forbidden activities . It is difficult , too , for an older person imbued with ideas of thrift through many years of self-denial to reconcile his ideas with the spending habits of younger people . The following case excerpt illustrates some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger households : Mrs. R. had lived with her widowed daughter , Mrs. W. , and acted as housekeeper for her and the four young children while Mrs. W. worked . Mrs. R. became ill and spent a long period in a convalescent home , after which she returned to her daughter 's home , although in a highly nervous condition . She attempted to resume her managership of the house and children . Meanwhile the children had not only grown older but had tasted a new freedom during their grandmother 's absence . The older children left the house early on summer mornings to play in the park , whereas the grandmother thought they should assume as their responsibilities the small household tasks of dishes , bedmaking , and dusting . The grandmother was also in conflict with the small son who wished to have his pet kitten in the house . Mrs. R. 's constant complaint was that her daughter was not raising the children properly . Unable to adjust the mother finally found it necessary to leave Mrs. W. 's home and to live with another daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus : The unity of our family life was somewhat broken because my paternal grandmother and aunt lived with us . Grandmother was old and childish , although exceptionally capable . She tried to boss , my aunt tried to boss , Dad  | objected sometimes and approved at other times , and Mother stood it although she often felt rebellious . There were frequent quarrels and bickerings , but none were serious nor did they last long . This situation has developed in me a rebellious spirit toward allowing in-laws to invade the home . Religious conflict in the home is described by a Jewish girl : Our family life was never a happy one . My parents were both engrossed in earning a living . Overtired , over-worked , and nervous , they quarreled very frequently . To make matters worse , there was my grandmother , my father 's mother . She was a crabby and cranky individual , very set in her ways , and her ways were much different from those of my parents . She was a strict orthodox Jew , while my parents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my mother hated her and was quiet only when my mother was not in sight . Much of the quarreling between my mother and grandmother was over household matters and my father was dragged in by proxy . The only peace lay in escape , so that my parents and myself spent most of our Sundays at various outings , at the park , or at friends . The elderly couple able to continue in independence or semi-independence are probably more happily situated than old persons who live alone or those incompletely incorporated into the families of relatives . They retain their independence , they have their own home , and they have each other . Sometimes they maintain with somewhat diminished activity the roles of their earlier years ; sometimes they develop new roles to replace the older ones . They may become " grandma " and " grandpa " to the neighborhood children to whom they dispense cookies . The man may become the " odd job " man of the neighborhood , upon whom housewives depend for small household repairs . The fact that husband and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for emotional readjustment is reduced . Even if they bicker and quarrel , they depend upon each other and probably have an underlying understanding of and appreciation for each other that may not be found in any combination of persons from different generations . The grandmother role . The grandmother role is essentially a reliving of the maternal role . Sometimes the grandmother role emphasizes the sentimental and pleasurable aspects of the maternal role , with scant regard for the responsibilities . The grandmother may say , " I had to worry over my own children ; I 'm going to enjoy my grandchild . " She may  | then center her emotions upon the child , indulging his passing whims and in general " spoiling " him . Usually she over-protects him and delays his maturity . Under these conditions , conflict between the grandmother and the child 's parents is very likely to arise over matters of discipline , eating , naps , and attitude toward authority . The child is likely to be torn between love for the mother and love for the grandmother . At other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's parents are neglecting to teach him the oldfashioned virtues . This attitude is associated with a certain lack of adjustment of the grandmother to the present conditions and mores ; in her insecurity she clings to the sterner precepts of a past day and seeks to pass them on to her grandchild . Vollmer , in an analysis of the situation , emphasizes that the grandchild fulfills an emotional need of the grandmother at a time when she feels that her period of usefulness is ended.20 Since she is often freed from the distractions of her own motherhood and the demands of her husband for attention , she develops a very tenacious tie with her grandchild . The child , however , is with the grandmother only for short periods and , besides , loves his mother . The grandmother 's emotional satisfaction is thus insecure , and the grandmother struggles against this by indulging the child and belittling the mother 's ability to care for the child properly . The grandparent role is evident in the following descriptions.21 The first was written by a girl of nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all wonderful to me . On my mother 's side , my grandfather used to play games with me and try to teach me little prayers to say before he would give me something to eat , like an apple which he would pare and slice for me . Grandma is a wonderful cook and she still delights in making fancy little loaves of bread or cakes or puddings for me . My father 's mother was much sterner but just as loving . Her specialties were coffee cake and jam , and I certainly made her happy when I ate them , which was as often as I could arrange it . footnote20 Hermann Vollmer , " The Grandmother : A Problem in Child-rearing , " American Journal of Ortltopsychiatry , 1937 , Vol. 7 , pp. 378-382. 21 Unpublished material from the White House Conference Study on the Adolescent in the Family .  | The grandparent role , carried to the point of usurpation of the parental role , is described in the next narrative by a young man : My mother and father lived with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I were born while they were living there , my sister dying just before I was born . When I was about three my father was forced to move because of his work and I remained with my grandparents until my parents became settled . When they did want me with them my grandparents did n't want to give me up and my folks rather than cause any trouble let me stay . Every Sunday my grandmother and I would go over and spend the day with mother , father , and my brothers , who lived not far away . For sixteen years , however , I never spent a night with my parents . My father raid I never got along well together . This disagreement came about because every time my father would say anything to me that I did n't like I would just take up and go home to my grandparents . My grandparents were very touchy about father saying anything to me and as a result we never did get along . Mother and my grandfolks got along pretty well . In my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tlnePr activities . My grandfather was my best pal . He would take me every place and even went to the extent of dressing up with me on Hallowe'en night and going around town with me . He would get me everything within reason . My grandfather and I shared in the raising of different pets . We raised everything from chickens to dogs . At one time I had rabbits , pigeons , chickens , and a dog . I remember teasing my grandfolks into getting av incubator . We used it once and by that time we were tired of it and sold it along with the chickens that came from the first hatching . The first dog they got me was a trained collie , which had been broken into pulling a wagon . My grandfather made me several little wagons which I could hitch to the dog . My grandfather would sit and listen to all my troubles and I put all my confidence in him . Increased leisure . The leisure of the elderly is a serious problem . Almost the only old woman who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to live in her own home . Once she has given it up and becomes a roomer in some household or a part of her sob 's or daughter 's family , she finds time heavy on her hands . In some of the households she is given some responsibilities , but often she is regarded as a fifth wheel which rotates more slowly than the other four . Or with a mistaken idea of providing her with a well-earned rest , the younger members of the family discourage her from doing much work .  | The man has too much leisure as soon as he is too old to work . His leisure is a result of retirement from work , and this retirement carries with it a number of problems . The husband usually receives his status from his occupation and develops his most intense interests about his work . If he owns his business or is a professional man he may maintain some connection with his business or profession until his death , regardless of age . But if he is one of the great majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later find himself unable longer to continue his work . He may be retired at a certain age , perhaps with a pension . In this case he suffers no loss of status , for his dismissal from work has no personal connotation but is simply part of the impersonal regulations under which he works . A pension implies service well done and at the same time relieves him of major economic need . He still has the problem of leisure time , which may hang heavily on his hands unless he has some hobby or can develop some leisure-time interest to fill his time . Sometimes latent interests long suppressed by the demands of a regular job are developed . College professors in retirement write long-dreamed-of books ; retired architects turn to painting pictures ; the man with a rural youth may raise vegetables , flowers , or chickens . But many men have no hobbies awaiting development and find time heavy on their hands . Their constant and uneasy presence in the house may irritate the wife who is accustomed to hours of privacy . If the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friction may arise between him and his wife who resents his seeming interference in a task that she has carried on for many years unaided . Filling in leisure time becomes more of a problem as age increases ; for many old friends have died , and the living old person may be the " last leaf " without friends . Experiments are just beginning to work out ways to bring elderly people together and to aid them to use their time to advantage and to have adequate recreation . Social gatherings with a minimum of supervision , so that the guests may work out their own ideas of entertainment , have been tried in some places . Adult-education classes keyed to the interests and energies of old people have been tried in others .  | SUGGESTED SUPPLEMENTARY READING Folsom , J.

It is a stage of social disorganization in which the disorganization has become so intensified that some reformulation of group habits is necessary . A society or an institution may exist for a long time with a mild degree of disorganization which is continuously adjusted through reorganization . This is a condition that is normal in a rapidly changing society , and one to which we have become more or less accustomed . A crisis is reached when the process of disorganization is speeded up and is not accompanied by a corresponding process of reorganization . Because a crisis involves the destruction of folkways and mores ? of the ways of living and patterns of thinking ? it can not continue for long . Either the processes of adjustment and reorganization are reestablished in some way or the society disintegrates . As applied to the family , a crisis is any situation in which the family finds itself unable to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions of the family . The situations that result in a crisis may of course be different for different families or in different societies or at different periods of time . Some types of disorganization affect individual families , as the processes of internal conflict that result in divorce . Other types of crisis affect entire communities , as the social disorganization that follows the destructive onslaught of hurricane or flood . Still other types of crisis affect families with a certain type of experience , as families in which the wage-earners lose their jobs because of a depression , or families touched by war .  | A crisis in the functioning of a social institution is very likely to involve the personal disorganization of some members of the institution ; and this is especially true of a crisis in the family , for the members of a family receive many satisfactions for fundamental emotional and biological urges through interaction with other members of the family . When the family does not function properly , the satisfaction of these urges is interfered with , and the person may suffer much emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns the disorganization of a social institution , the family , and the personal disorganization of the members of the family . The specific critical situations discussed in this section are examples of crises , through which the processes of disorganization , of reaction to crisis , and of reorganization or disintegration may be studied . This process applies both to the family as an institution and to the members of the family involved in the crisis . As the institution goes through the process of social change , the person may go through a somewhat similar emotional process . The particular crises chosen seem to be ones most commonly found in our own society .  | DIVORCE , with its public hearings and newspaper headlines , is so conspicuous that many people have unthinkingly regarded divorce as an entity in itself , as something evil that enters a marriage and destroys it . Thus people speak of the " divorce evil " and advocate more stringent laws or the abolition of divorce , on the assumption that if there were no provision for divorce , families would be unified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is applied for , either husband or wife , or both , have come to the conclusion that the marital relationship is so unpleasant that they do not wish to continue it . People asking for divorces seek divorce as an escape from an intolerable situation . The evil is not divorce , but the preceding sense of an intolerable situation . Divorces are not imposed upon the family from without , but come only at the petition of one party to the marriage . The divorce is simply the legal recognition that a contract called marriage has been broken , and that henceforth marital privileges and obligations do not exist between the once-married pair ; divorce also adjusts property rights and fixes certain new obligations , chiefly those of the custody of any minor children and the support of the wife and children . Divorce is not the result of any one type of family conflict . The laws of the various states list a total of thirty-nine " grounds " for divorce , the most commonly found being adultery , drunkenness , refusal of the husband to support his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . period of time , cruelty , imprisonment or conviction of crime , insanity ,  | and impotence . ) When these legal grounds are present , the injured party may , but is not forced to , obtain a divorce . The variety of grounds in many of the states and the possibility of establishing a residence in a particular state to obtain a divorce make it possible for any person to fit his marital difficulties into the legal pattern of some state and there obtain a divorce . It has long been recognized that the legal grounds for divorce reveal very little about the underlying situation that has led to the determination of husband or wife to end the marriage . To understand divorce as a part of the process of married life , it is necessary to examine the processes of interaction that go on between husband and wife when dissension occurs between them . To appreciate divorce as a part of the social institution of matrimony , it is advisable to trace the divorce practices through the historical background that provided our social heritage . The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the historical background , and finally the present-day extent of divorce . DISSENSION Under such terms as family discord , marital maladjustment , and family disorganization , dissension among family members has been studied by many people . Dissension occurs when the members of the family are unable to reach some workable degree of unity . They have somehow failed to find common objectives and an identity of attitudes . They have failed to develop roles that are reciprocal and that will function together smoothly . They have failed to achieve the assimilation that marks a happy marriage . The family may go along for years in a mildly disorganized state , or the disorganization may come to a crisis . Then the family may break up and disintegrate through separation of the members , with or without divorce ; or a conscious attempt at reorganization may be made . We have spoken of the first few years of married life as the period when two people weld themselves into the unity of a family . This period is therefore critical in the process of family life ; for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the begin- footnoteC . G. Vernier , American Family Laws , Vol. 2 , Stanford University Press , 1932.  | fling . Much of this early discord reaches a crisis and results in divorce . Careful studies of divorce show that divorces are more likely to occur during the third to the fifth years of marriage than at any other time . Divorce rates per i , 000 marriages are almost twice as high during these years as during the first year of marriage . After these seemingly critical years , the rate of divorce per 1,000 marriages declines gradually and by the ninth year of marriage is as low as during the first year . Further decline marks succeeding years of duration of marriage until , by the twenty-eighth year of marriage , the divorce rate is negligible.2 What are some of the reasons why unity is not achieved during the first few years of marriage ? It will be recalled from chapter 6 that two types of roles are important in marital adjustment : the personal roles and the social roles . The accommodation and eventual complete assimilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and wife to work out complementary roles which will permit them to accept the obligations usually laid upon a married couple by society , and which also will permit both husband and wife to achieve the maximum satisfaction for their own interests and wishes . These achievements are not reached without flexibility and sacrifice by both husband and wife . Dissension based upon personal roles . The development of personal roles in the parental family has been discussed in chapter 7 . These personal roles have not been developed with special reference to marital adjustment ; they are the more or less accidental results of experiences first in the family and later in other groups . They operate in all social relationships , but in the intimacy and unavoidably close associations of family life they are especially subject to stress and strain . Although the word role implies a consistent and continuous acting of one part in social relationships , actually most people do not achieve complete consistency , but may assume one role in one group and another role in another group . Thus a person who has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may compensate by seeking great superiority in another group . Or a person 's interests may be such that he values the associations and high opinion of only one group , say a footnote2 T. P. Monahan , " The Changing Probability of Divorce , " American Sociological Review , 1940 , Vol. 5 , pp. 539-545.  | professional group to which he belongs , and is indifferent to the opinions of other groups . Also , most people are inconsistent in their reactions to various situations ; thus a woman may be very cool-headed during an automobile accident , but nervous and frightened at the sight of a mouse . Or a husband may be tender and considerate of his wife in their sexual relationships , but autocratic where the spending of money is concerned . These inconsistencies as well as the basic role must be considered in relation to marital adjustment.3 When a person has failed to achieve a certain degree of consistency in personality , marital maladjustment may follow . Sometimes a person vacillates from one role to another , often with periods of disorganization between . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacillated between a conventional role and an unconventional role . His conventional role represented his adjustment made as a child to his parental family . The unconventional role had been learned in later associations with a group of radicals . As a conventional man , he acknowledged the usual obligations of married life . As an unconventional radical , he denied the need for religion and the necessity for marriage . He had followed his early training in marrying and had married a wife of the conventional type . He was dependent upon her in many ways , and this had called forth maternal reactions from her , which he resented . Corresponding to his unconventional tendencies , he had established an extra-marital relationship with a woman who represented to him love and freedom . With his two conflicting roles he needed both the protective conventional family life and the freedom of his illicit contact . The relationships with his wife varied with the role he played . His wife wanted a conventional type of married life ; and when her husband played the conventional role , the two were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uppermost , husband and wife were in conflict.4 Persons who move in two cultural worlds and are not completely integrated into either may also vacillate in the roles they play . This type footnote8 H. R. Mowrer , Personality Adjustment and Domestic Discord , American Book Corn . pant , 1935 , chap . 3. 4Ibid. , pp. 51-69.  | of role-conflict is most readily seen in persons reared in one culture but with contacts in another culture . The term " marginal man " has been applied to such a persona When the marginal man marries into one cultural group , he may find himself vacillating between the marital expectations of the two groups . An interesting case of this type is presented by Pauline V. Young in one of her books. ? Mrs. Pavlova was a young Russian woman , a member of the Molokans , a deeply religious group that lives in a colony in Los Angeles . Among the Molokans the family organization is patriarchal , and children are early sent out to work to aid in the support of the other numerous children . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a shawl instead of a hat . Members of the group are forbidden to dance , smoke , drink , or play cards . The religious organization is very strong . Mrs. Pavlova was reared in this group ; but when she began to work in a factory , she gradually adopted American habits of dress and recreation , concealing from her parents as long as she could each deviation from the mores of the colony . Each revelation of a deviation ? the buying of a hat , going to a dance with an American man , and so on ? brought quarrels at home and genuine emotional distress to her parents . The quarrels between Mrs. Pavlova and her parents finally centered upon whether she should marry a Russian Molokan or an American . Mrs. Pavlova was in love with an American and wished to marry him , but she could not bring herself to make a complete break with the colony and her parents . She was , as she said , " halfway between the American and the Russian ways . " Eventually she married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After two years of marriage , she admitted that she and her husband did not get along . They fussed and quarreled . The husband loved her , but he wanted a wife typical of the Russian colony , who would center her interests in him and provide a home and family of the conventional colony type . Mrs. Pavlova , however , liked to read , which made her husband think she was not interested in him ; and she refused to have any children , a direct violation of the mores . She did not attend the religious and social meetings regularly . At the same time she could footnote6 E. V. Stonequist , The Marginal Man , Scribner 's , 1937. 6 P. V. Young , Interviewing in Social Work , McGraw-Hill , 1935 , pp. 220-234.  | not tear herself away from the old life . She had two Russian dresses and a shawl and attended important functions , such as a feast or a wedding or a funeral . Although she wanted to , she could not bring herself to leave her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents . In this family the husband appears to be a conventional type in terms of the mores of the Molokans and , married to a woman of the same type , undoubtedly would have led an uneventful life . But Mrs. Pavlova had not been able to achieve an integrated role . At times she was the Russian wife ; at times the young American seeking fun and freedom . Had she married an American , she would have been equally unhappy and the marriage equally maladjusted , for she would not have been able to play the American role consistently . A further development of vacillating roles occurs when one person plays two ( or more ) completely independent roles . With vacillating roles , the person is aware of the conflict and is confused and disorganized , feeling guilty when he denies the old role and unhappy when he follows it . With independent roles , the person usually has rationalized his roles and justifies his inconsistency in shifting from one role to the other . Mrs. Mowrer related the case of Mr. K. , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscrupulous non-Jew playing the part of an unmarried man . He rationalized and justified the two roles and played them blithely without full consciousness of their inconsistency . His wife , a member of a respectable Jewish family who wished to maintain the Jewish traditions , found herself in a difficult position , liking the Jewish role her husband played , but disliking the non-Jewish role . Married to a Jew who would have supported the tradidons and mores of the Jewish community , the wife would probably have been well-adjusted in her marriage . Mr. K. , however , would probably not have adjusted had he married a Gentile , since he would still have shifted from the Gentile role to the Jewish role , thus not meeting the expectations of a Gentile wife. ? The emotionally immature person who still plays the role of dependent child often finds marital adjustment difficult . Sometimes such people do not marry at all ; or when they marry they are unable to free footnote7 Mowrer , op . Cit. , pp. 70-87.  | themselves from their parental attachments . ' The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dependent upon the mother , who tried to dominate the entire family . The mother disapproved of marriage for the sons and daughters , especially for the eldest son , who bought her many luxuries . When the second son married , he established his home near that of his parents . Each evening he visited his mother and often would lie on the bed and cry , saying he wanted to remain there and sleep in his old bed . The mother would comfort him and tell his wife to go on home , saying that her son would be all right in a few weeks . After a few months the son 's wife left him and returned to her own home , but later was reconciled with her husband , who succeeded in detaching himself to some extent from his mother . After ten years of marriage the son still drove twelve miles every other evening to see his mother . When the eldest son was in his thirties he married , against the wishes of his mother . The mother accompanied him and his bride on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal purchases amounting to some hundred and fifty dollars , which the son , in accordance with his usual practices , paid . Upon their return home the mother wished to dictate the policies of her son 's home , a procedure that his wife resented . In the friction that developed , the son sided with his mother . When the marriage was only two months old , the son was having lunch with his mother every day and was spending several nights a week at his old home . Soon the son had agreed to help his mother buy a home . At this point the wife decided that her husband 's attachment to his mother was so much greater than his attachment to her that adjustment would never be possible ; she therefore left her husband and procured a divorce . ' The emotionally immature woman is less handicapped than the emotionally immature man , especially if she marries a man who likes to play the dominant role and who receives personal satisfaction from protecting her in the way in which her parents had shielded her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her footnote8 See G. K.

Mrs. B. is an old lady now , whose entire life has followed the pattern of the protected child . Her father , a doctor , dominated his famly and made their decisions for them . Mrs. B. married at an early age and received from her husband the same protective care that the father had given . At the same time the father continued daily visits to his daughter , was present at the births of her children , and personally supervised their rearing . When , in later life , Mrs. B. was left a widow , an unmarried daughter willingly assumed the burden not only of her support , but of shielding her as much as possible from hardships and shocks . The immature persons who are unable to meet the responsibilities of married life often develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mechanisms at some length in their relation to marital maladjustment . " Illness as a means of escape from too arduous marital responsibilities is perhaps most likely to be used by women , for the mores define an ill woman as an object for sympathy and tenderness . The woman who has been a frail child , the youngest child , or a pampered child , regarded by the family as less capable than other members , seems especially prone to develop illness as a means of evading family responsibilities . Unable to continue in marriage the role of the beloved dependent child , the woman finds herself unhappy and may use illness as a means for avoiding unpleasant sexual relations , child-bearing , or housework . Men , untrained for the responsibilities of married life , often seek escape through drinking . The husband with the ill wife and the wife with the drinking husband are soon irritated by the situation , although often they do not understand the reasons underlying the illness or the drinking . Thus a poor adjustment based on the inability of one marital partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the attempts at escape practiced by the ineffectual partner . Phantasy is the third form of escape from incompatible marital roles . The person may not indulge in day-dreams , but during a part of his life may lead a make-believe existence . In one case a man is described who had a position of low status in his parental family ; he earned a moderate income and married within his social class . But in his leisure footnote10 Mowrer , op. cit .. pp. 88-145.  | hours he attempted to play the role of the man about town , joining clubs , serving on committees , buying clothes for which he could not pay , and so on . His wife had no part in this phantasy existence and resented his conduct and the reckless spending of money needed for necessities . Opposite in some respects to the immature and dependent person is the one who must constantly dominate a situation in order to satisfy some inner need . Sometimes this need can be worked out in some aspect of family life in which it does not hamper the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sadistic , and the dominating person feels satisfaction in proportion to the amount of submission gained from the spouse . The " hen pecked " husband and the wife who is " like a little mouse " are the correlates of dominant spouses . But unless the one dominated is of a very submissive type , conflict is likely to occur ; and when two persons each of whom wishes to play a dominant role marry , they are almost sure to quarrel . Sometimes the conflict is adjusted by each person assuming the dominance in one field , for instance the husband may be able to drain off his need to dominate into his business and permit the wife superiority in household management ; or the wife may enter a business or professional field and achieve superiority there . When both seek dominance in the same field , rivalry and conflict usually follow . It has been suggested that much of the marital instability of motion picture stars is because husband and wife try to excel in the same field.11 The types of discord so far discussed have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The person has failed before marriage to achieve an integrated role ; or the role assumed did not fit the person for the obligations and responsibilities of marriage ; or two people with conflicting , rather than complementary , personal roles had married . The difficulties of adjustment resting on personal roles are not confined to marriage ; they would be evident in any social situation which made demands upon the person . When found in husband or wife , however , such roles interfere with the process by which husband and wife normally arrive at identity of purposes and achieve a common life in which each finds satisfaction for his interests and footnote11 Pratt , op. cit. , p. 865.  | needs . Thus the personal disorganization of one member to the marriage prevents the smooth functioning of the family as a social institution . Usually , also , it contributes to the personal disorganization of the other marital partner , at least temporarily . The well-adjusted spouse has entered marriage with certain expectations , probably somewhat idealized , of happiness and of a common life together . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations leads to disappointment and perhaps to frustration of certain ambitions . Moreover , the disappointment and frustration , which may arise in one aspect of the common life , say , with reference to the struggle for dominance , tend to spread to other phases of the common life . Soon husband and wife may find themselves unable to agree on any common activity , plan , or point of view . Dissension based on conflicting social roles and attitudes . Difficulties may arise when two persons marry , each of whom is well organized but holds a different conception of marital roles . Most obvious are the difficulties that arise when people of different cultural backgrounds marry . The area of conflict may center in different conceptions of family life . The young man who moves from the farm to the city and adopts urban attitudes , then returns to the rural community to marry his high-school sweetheart and take her to the city may find that his conceptions of married life have changed so greatly that adjustment is impossible . The girl may think of home as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want children and next-door neighbors ; she may think of Sunday as a clay for church attendance ; she may regard public dance halls as dens of iniquity . The husband may have come to regard a small hotel apartment as the most comfortable type of dwelling ; he may want to postpone the birth of children ; he may think of Sunday as a day for relaxation through golf or motion pictures and may have developed a fondness for dancing in public places . Such differences in cultural background as nationality cultural patterns or religious beliefs also may result in marital conflict . Conflicts may not concern the total cultural background , but simply one phase related to family life . Typical of such conflicts are those that arise because of different conceptions on the part of husband and wife  | as to what sexual intimacy should include . Such conflicts are probably less acute now than a generation ago , because girls enter marriage with a more adequate understanding of sex both as a physical and as an emotional aspect of marriage . But it is probably still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious event will occur , but totally ignorant of its exact nature . Others have been taught that sex is " dirty " and a duty to be borne . Still others have a very idealistic conception of sexual relations and demand perfection from the husband in the art of love-making . The husband is likely to have a more realistic conception of sex . The mores have not prohibited his gaining information to the extent that girls have been prohibited , and he therefore tends to class sexual relations along with other physical reactions rather than to invest them with romantic mystery . Also the mores have tolerated , although not approved of , sexual relations for the unmarried man . At the same time that this greater knowledge which the husband may have frees him from fear of a new relationship , it may make him too hasty or too eager in his approach to an unsophisticated wife.12 Two people otherwise companionable may clash over different ideas of who should control the pocketbook , or how Sunday should be spent , or how the children should be disciplined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which unity and a common family organization of attitudes and activities is achieved . Sexual maladjustment . It should be evident from the discussion up to this point that many marital conflicts arise from non-sexual aspects of married life.13 But the sexual maladjustment may be central . This is true in cases where husband and wife marry with different conceptions of the role that sex should play in married life . It is also true if the physical reactions of husband and wife differ ; for instance , if one reaches a physical climax during sexual intercourse quickly and the other slowly , dissatisfaction may follow . Each may feel that the other has failed , or each may feel that he has failed ; or one may blame the other , who accepts the responsibility with resulting loss of pride . These footnote12 See also Mowrer , op. cit. , PP. 149-169. 13 See also chap . 6 , pp. 185-19o.  | various feelings of guilt and accusation interfere further with the sexual relationship , and in time it may come to be meaningless or unpleasant to one or both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sexual ; elationship in time may become involved as a secondary result . If husband and wife have quarreled over finances or over some special type of recreation or , in fact , over almost anything , their emotional reactions toward each other may become generalized and include all aspects of their common life together . Sometimes , and especially often for the wife , sex may become associated with unpleasant experiences . The wife who has suffered intensely at childbirth may associate sexual relations with this experience and wish to avoid sexual contacts . Or if the wife has several children and does not want more , she may react negatively to sexual relations . In general , it is necessary to realize that sex is not simply a physical act , but that it has meaning gained from the person 's early training and his pre-marital experiences as well as his post-marital experiences . For one person sex may mean a very pleasurable experience , and a satisfactory sexual relationship may he maintained between husband and wife during a long period of conflict in other fields and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be associated with feelings of sin or guilt , or with pain , and sexual relationships may be a center of conflict while other aspects of marital life are harmonious . The tendency , however , is for lack of harmony in one phase of married life to spread to other phases and for displeasure with the spouse over one type of frustration to spread and become generalized dislike . Thus , in time , most types of marital maladjustment come to include sexual maladjustment . Adjustment of marital difficulties . Unless they are of the most superficial sort , marital difficulties are not easily adjusted . Rooted as they are in personality or in differences in cultural concepts , they can be cured only by attacking the personal organization or the cultural concepts of those involved . Since both personal and cultural roles have been developing since early childhood , it is not an easy task to change them . Mrs. Mowrer , in clinical work with cases such as those described in her book , found that at least two years were required for two people to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases to aid the person to reformulate his entire personality . In the cases of conflict between people not seriously maladjusted personally , it was necessary to give them some understanding of the basis of their trouble and to aid them in finding common interests and points of view , in compromising and adapting themselves , in short in accommodating themselves and becoming assimilated into a unified family group . Although clinics staffed with trained sociologists , psychologists , or psychiatrists are increasing in number , they are still available only to a minority of people . Most married people muddle through their difficulties as best they may , with inexpert advice from family , friends , ministers , doctors , and others . When all efforts at adjustment have failed , some form of separation is likely to occur . DESERTION AND SEPARATION Desertion may be defined as the wilful and prolonged absence of one spouse . Desertion has sometimes been called the " poor man 's divorce . " Desertion , however , is not divorce . For desertion has no legal status , and the privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are by divorce . Desertion or other forms of informal separation usually follow dissension . Desertion in a sense is a vacation from marriage , a " breather " during which each side has an opportunity to think the matter over ; the attempt at adjustment is often resumed after a period of separation . These desertions may occur periodically and may even become part of the rhythm of married life and be accepted without emotional conflict . Or they may be in the nature of evasions , as among men who desert when a new baby is imminent but return after the child has been born . During the depression of the 1930 's , when the family relationships became tense because of the husband 's inability to find work and therefore inability to support his family , some husbands deserted for longer or shorter periods . In other cases the desertion is permanent . Either husband or wife may drop out of sight , unceremoniously and without warning . Sometimes the desertion is followed by divorce ; footnote14 Mowrer , op. cit. , p. 269.  | in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other may enter into an association with another person , similar to a common-law marriage . Since desertions are not legal separations , they may occur informally and without a public record . In 1928 an estimate of 50,000 desertions per year was made by the National Desertion Bureau , after information was obtained from social agencies in almost one hundred cities.15 This was equal to about one fourth of the number of divorces granted that year . More definite information for study can be found in the cases brought in the courts for non-support . Such cases do not always involve desertion , since a wife may bring a suit for non-support when her husband lives at home but refuses to work or refuses to support his family . Nevertheless , many cases of non-support include actual separation as well as a refusal to accept responsibility for support . They are usually brought by the wife and therefore do not give a clue to cases in which the wife deserts the husband . Mowrer , who defines desertion as synonymous with non-support , has studied the cases for non-support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 the non-support cases equaled almost one third of the divorce cases , an indication that all desertion cases must have equaled a much higher proportion of divorce cases . In 1935 , due primarily to a decrease in non-support cases , these cases equaled approximately one fifth of the divorce cases . In 1935 in Chicago there were 41.8 divorce cases and 8.6 non-support cases per 10,000 married persons . Several attempts have been made to associate desertion with special groups . Mowrer compared the percentage of each racial or nativity group in Chicago with the percentage of husbands arrested for nonsupport in 1921 from the same racial or nativity group.17 Seven foreignborn white groups each had a higher percentage of offending husbands than the percentage that these groups constituted of the total population . The Poles showed the greatest discrepancy : 5. o per cent of the total population consisted of persons born in Poland , as compared with 9.7 per ent of the erring husbands . Other foreign-born groups with percentages footnote15 Quoted by R. E. Baber , Marriage and the Family , McGraw-Hill , 1939 , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ecology of Family Disintegration in Chicago , " American Sociological Review , 1938 , Vol. 3 , p. 345. 17 E. R. Mowrer , The Family , University of Chicago Press , 1932 , pp. 164 , 167-168 , 191.  | of arrested husbands that exceeded the percentage of the group in the total population were Russians , Italians , Austrians , Hungarians , Lithuanians , and Greeks . A still greater discrepancy was shown by the Negroes , who constituted 4. o per cent of the total population but contributed 15 . E per cent of the husbands arrested for non-support . Native-born whites had a low non-support rate as compared with their proportion in the total population : 66.3 per cent of the population were native-born whites , but only 46. o per cent of the husbands were native-born whites . The reasons for the differences among nativity groups are chiefly a matter of speculation . It may be that certain groups because of elements in their native culture have a particularly difficult time to adjust to life in America and hence are subject to more extensive family disorganization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have religious or cultural prejudices against divorce and hence desertion becomes a substitute for divorce . Unfortunately , Mowrer does not make a similar classification of divorces by nativity . Mowrer 's further analysis concerns " mixed marriages " ; that is , marriages in which husband and wife come from different nativity groups or from different religious groups . He found that arrests for non-support , when they occur , come at an earlier period of married life for both types of mixed marriages than for like marriages . To be specific , of all non-support cases in which husband and wife were of the same nativity group , 44.6 per cent occurred during the first five years of married life ; while of all cases in which husband and wife were of different nativity groups , 53.5 per cent occurred during the first five years of married life . For the classification by religion , four groups were used : Jewish , Catholic , Protestant , and CatholicProtestant or marriages in which one spouse was Catholic and the other Protestant . Of all non-support cases in which both husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first five years of married life ; for Catholics , 35.2 per cent of the arrests occurred during the first five years ; for Protestants , 49.4 per cent . In contrast are the cases in which husband and wife represented different religious backgrounds ( Catholic and Protestant ) ; 57.5 per cent of such non-support cases occurred during the first five years of married life . Mowrer also shows the community distribution of non-support cases , and the high rates occur in the poverty-stricken districts . It becomes extremely difficult to disen-  | tangle the various factors , for nativity , religious affiliation , and poverty overlap . The concentration of foreign-born groups in the areas of poverty is especially marked . Although the relation of children to desertion cases in general is not known , their presence is found in the majority of non-support cases . In 1935 only 24 per cent of the couples involved in non-support cases in Chicago were childless and the mean number of children was 1.62. ' 8 Non-support charges are perhaps to be expected in those cases in which there are children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wives with children feel the financial pinch of desertion more keenly than childless wives . The non-support charges in Mowrer 's study were brought , on the average , after ten years of married life and after three years of separation . Other studies show that desertions may be repeated within one family . Among one hundred cases of desertion studied by O'Neill and Glover , 50 per cent of the offenders had deserted more than once , and Colcord found 87 per cent of the deserters in her study were repeaters.19 This indicates that desertion is not a final solution of the family 's problems and that a return may simply indicate a temporary reconciliation . A brief case-abstract will show the complications sometimes involved : Mr. Brownlee was an habitual drunkard and had been so since youth . Support of his wife and four children was very uncertain . During the first three years of marriage Mrs. Brownlee had had her husband arrested once for drunkenness and non-support . When the first two children were babies , she appealed to the charities for aid as her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support the family at all and came home drunk every evening . A warrant for his arrest was sworn out ; but when the case came up in court , Mrs. Brownlee refused to prosecute . A few years later he was again brought into court and was put on probation . A year later Mr. Brownlee was again drinking and failing to support his family and was sent to jail where he remained for a few weeks until a friend paid his fine . Mrs. Brownlee then refused to have her husband return home until he promised to stop drinking and to work steadily . Within a month footnote18 E. R. Mowrer , American Sociological Review , op. cit. , pp. 347-348. 19 E. F. O'Neill and R. J. Glover , " Report on a Study of One Hundred Cases of Desertion , " The Family , 1929 , Vol. 9 , pp. 287 ? 291 ; J. C. Colcord , Broken Homes , Russell Sage , 1919.  | he was again drinking and not working . When his wife urged him to find work he left home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his wife would not permit this until he promised to allow her to collect his wages . Within six months Mr. Brownlee was again drinking . His wife wished a formal separation and finally had her husband arrested , after which he was sent to jail . When he was released he wished to return home , but his wife refused to permit him to do so . She consulted a lawyer regarding either separate maintenance or a divorce . Meanwhile Mr. Brownlee had begun to work and send money home ; finally he returned home , whereupon his wife left and was away for a week . Upon her return she turned her husband out of the house . Two weeks later they were again reconciled , and four months later Mr. Brownlee was again unemployed . This case includes both desertions and arrests for non-support , neither of which affected reorganization of the family , whose basic difficulty rested upon the drunkenness , unemployment , and subsequent lack of earning power of the husband . It shows clearly what other cases also show , that desertion is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is one way in which husband and wife seek to solve their difficulties . In the majority of cases the husband is the deserter . The wife has two possible handicaps : children , toward whom she feels a sense of responsibility ; and lack of financial support . Even the restless and dissatisfied mother finds it difficult to cast aside her obligations toward her children ; the entire round of her life has centered in their care and she tends to carry out her habitual tasks even though they are irksome . Also , desertion of children by the mother is regarded as more reprehensible than desertion by the father , so that the deserting mother would be more likely to feel guilty and to be socially ostracized by family and friends than the deserting father . If the mother took her children with her and left her husband she would face a tremendous problem of selfsupport , or the humiliation of returning to the home of her parents or seeking aid from other relatives . Thus the mother by deserting adds to her emotional and economic burdens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic burdens and , it must be assumed , also from emotional tensions . The family that he deserts , however , faces complicated problems . They are usually left without means of support , and wife and children often  | feel a vicarious sense of shame that the " head of the family " has failed to live up to his role . Also the wife may feel a personal sense of failure that she has not been able " to hold " her husband . The legal recourse in cases of desertion is either divorce in states where desertion is a ground for divorce , or , when the husband is the deserter , a charge of non-support or of child abandonment . The latter two are effective only if the husband can be found . He may be imprisoned for his failure to support his family , or he may be paroled with the hope that he will resume his financial obligations toward his family.20 Desertion should not be confused with separation . Although severe conflict may precede desertion , it is assumed that the deserted spouse wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left without the consent of the other . But sometimes husband and wife agree to part . Such mutual separations may come precipitately as the climax of quarreling and conflict in which case they may not be permanent . Or they may come as the deliberate decision that the marriage has failed ? " We agreed to separate . " It should be noted that when desertion is a ground for divorce , it is assumed that one party did not desire a separation and therefore is the injured and deserted party . A mutual agreement to separate in which neither husband nor wife can claim to be the injured party is not a ground for divorce . DIVORCE Legally , divorce is a device that terminates the state of matrimony created by the legal contract of marriage . Sociologically , divorce is the formal declaration that the process of accommodation and assimilation , which is marriage , has failed . Divorce follows the crisis when husband and wife admit that they can not adapt themselves to married life . Divorce means that all efforts to create harmony out of dissension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple is ready to end completely all semblance of married life and wishes to be free perhaps for a new matrimonial venture . footnote20 Nathan Isaacs and Max Radin , Legal Relations , Vol. 6 of The National Law Library , Collier , 1939 , pp. 169-170.  | The crisis of divorce . The process by which marital maladjustment reaches divorce and the dissolution of the marriage relationship is the reverse of the process by which courtship leads to married life . At the beginning of courtship are two independent individuals , each with his own pattern of life , playing his own role without regard to the other . Courtship and early married life involve a process of identification of interests and of adjustment of social and personal roles to each other , the curbing of individual interests to avoid conflict , and the expanding of other interests and activities to round out the familial duties . When divorce occurs soon after marriage , accommodation and assimilation may not have been complete . When divorce comes after many years of marriage , the marriage adjustment may have been well made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In either case , differences enter in , and the feeling of identity is lost . Individual interests gradually replace joint interests , individual roles replace familial roles , and two separate personalities emerge . This process of resuming individual personalities does not take place without emotional reactions , vacillations , and maneuvering . The first sign of loss of identity or unity brings insecurity and with it fear and caution . A way of living that has become habitual , even if it is filled with dissension , is threatened , and unknown adjustments lie ahead . If one of the couple is still in love with the other , the emotional reactions become intensified ; if there are children and it seems probable that their loyalty may be shaken , again emotional reactions are intensified . If the love of both husband and wife has cooled and there are no children , the emotional reactions may be at low ebb , but they are usually present in some degree . Rarely does the marriage end with a clean break . Rather the couple vacillate ; habit and memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolong the marriage . But as irreconcilable points of difference or of conflict arise , the periods of dissension or of lack of unity come more often and last longer . At some point in the process the satisfactions of marriage no longer outweigh the dissatisfactions , for at least one of the pair . This one has again visualized himself as an independent individual , freed from mari-  | tal and familial roles . Divorce seems not merely a dimly desirable possibility , but a certainty . It is relatively easy now for separation or desertion to occur . Again the couple may vacillate and become united for a time , as old habits and memories temporarily blot out the conflict . But unless a fundamental adjustment of personality and roles has been effected , the conflicts will again burst out and separation again destroy the union . Finally , this period of vacillation ends and divorce procedures actually are begun . With divorce the person is free , yet not free . Legally , he is free to remarry . Psychologically , he is not free , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional experience . Some people are totally unable to free themselves from the bonds of matrimony , even though they know that the spouse has lost all emotional interest and even though all marital relations have ceased . Such people remain extremely unhappy and at times through suicide seek both to escape from the situation and to take revenge on the spouse who is regarded as the source of all the unhappiness . " I can not live without you " and " Now you will realize what you have done to me " are the dual complaints of last letters written by such persons . Occasionally the disappointed one will kill the spouse before committing suicide . " If I can not have you , no one else shall , " is a not uncommon expression in suicide notes . Readjustment after divorce . The fractional units of the family that remain after a divorce differ according to the composition of the family . If there are no children , two individuals emerge . The wife may resume her maiden name and return to her parental family as a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might any unmarried woman . The husband becomes a bachelor , with the social privileges of the unmarried man . If there are children the situation is very different . If the children are given into the custody of the mother , as is usually the case , she usually maintains a home for them ; she loses the wifely role but retains the maternal role . If finances permit , she continues to maintain and run her home ; the husband may shuffle off the paternal role along with the husbandly role and rarely or never see his children , although often he helps to pay for their support . If the children spend a part of the year with each parent in turn , the husband and wife shift periodically  | from the familial role of parent to the role of independent , unmarried person . The adjustment that is made after a divorce must be in terms of the role or roles to be assumed . The effects of the adjustment are likely to be most acute for the divorced woman . Often she has an economic adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present attitude against a woman 's acceptance of alimony unless she is unfitted for employment or has children usually means that the woman must become employed . Perhaps she has been employed in classroom , office , or factory before her marriage , but for an interval of five or ten years has filled the traditional role of housekeeper ; the shift back to employment may be difficult , not only because of the change of habits involved but because skills used in the earlier period of employment may have been lost through disuse . Again the techniques of her trade or profession may have changed so that her earlier training is out of date . The divorced woman is also more likely than the divorced man to meet criticism and curiosity . Unless she resumes her maiden name and the title of Miss , she must account for an absent husband , and divorce arouses curiosity and in some groups criticism . The husband may have to make an economic adjustment , if he pays alimony . This adjustment may be severe , especially if he wishes to marry again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families . If there are children and the wife continues to maintain the home , the husband alone must readjust his living arrangements . The husband does not , however , have to explain the absence of a wife simply by the title he bears , for " Mr. " does not distinguish the unmarried from the married man . CASES OF MARITAL DISCORD The cases that follow illustrate many of the processes involved in dissension , desertion , divorce , and readjustment . The parenthetic statements call attention to pertinent points . The Walkers . Mr. Walker , an electrical engineer , was an opinionated person who liked to read , to discuss abstract questions , and to follow certain hobbies related to his work . He dominated his wife and two sons , demandang high standards of conduct from them , and refusing to allow them . to  | take vacations or indulge in simple amusements . He was very critical of both wife and sons and did not hesitate to correct his wife on pronunciation or grammar before outsiders . He felt that he and his wife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He also thought that his wife was careless about her housework and that her friends were not worthwhile from an intellectual point of view . ( Mr. Walker and his wife had failed to develop unity and a common life organization . ) His attempts at ' criticism and his insistence upon intellectual interests seemed in reality to be compensation for a feeling of inferiority and a lack of adjustment in social relationships . ( Poor personal role for the give and take of marriage . ) Mrs. Walker was the youngest child in a farm family . She was married at the age of seventeen against her father 's wishes . She soon discovered that she and her husband had different views about almost everything and that she did not measure up to his expectations of her . She was hurt by his criticisms and spent many hours crying ; she felt that his objections to her friends and the type of reading that she enjoyed were unjust . ( She had an emotionally immature personality , not well suited to the demands of marriage . ) After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred . This desertion on the part of the husband was in the guise of employment in a foreign country . ( Escape of the husband from conflict through a face-saving device . ) Mr. Walker told his wife that he would be away six or seven months . For a time he wrote to her every two weeks , then not at all . For a period of a year she did not hear from him . She then cabled him , and with little encouragement from him made arrangements to go to him with the children . Mr. Walker did not seem glad to see his wife , and during their period together in the foreign country he frequently was absent for three or four weeks at a time . They quarreled , and Mr. Walker told his wife he did not see why she had come as she was not wanted . ( Failure to accommodate . ) Mrs. Walker began to have attacks of neuralgia which continued intermittently during succeeding years ; for these attacks physicians could not find any organic basis . ( Appeal for sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker 's attacks culminated in a nervous breakdown . Mr. Walker was very unsympathetic and believed her illness was due to lack of will power .

( General family disorganization . ) Mrs. Walker 's headaches continued , although physicians were still unable to find an organic basis . Mr. Walker began to threaten desertion unless his wife would promise to stop having headaches . ( Desertion threats as a technique of.control . ) These threats further upset Mrs. Walker , who feared that if her  | husband left he would not provide for the support of herself and the two boys . ( Wife 's fear of insecurity . ) Her attacks became more frequent , and Mr. Walker left for two days .

He sent one son to his mother and gave the other a small amount of money for board . Then he packed a bag , placed it in his car , and left the city . Almost a year later Mr. Walker returned to the city , but not to his family . ( Permanent desertion . ) Mrs. Walker had him brought into court on a charge of non-support , and arrangements were made for him to pay $r5 a week .

The interpretation of the case is the author's.  | A brother aided Rose and her children for about a year , when Rose married Mike Marrelli . Two children were born . Mr. Marrelli worked irregularly and spent much of his time and money in saloons . Mr. and Mrs. Marrelli were unable to work out an agreeable family relationship . Mrs. Marrelli at times refused to have sexual relations with her husband , and he became jealous of her because she was attractive to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The failure to provide adequate support was also a cause for conflict . ( Failure to accommodate and to achieve unity . ) Two years after their marriage Mr. Marrelli was out of work for eight months and spent much of his time drinking with friends . He had threatened to take one of the children and leave his wife . She in turn wished to place the children in a home and leave him . The social agency was again appealed to for aid . Later , when Mrs. Marrelli was pregnant , her husband deserted . ( Evasion of family responsibilities . ) About five months later Mr. Marrelli returned home , and began drinking and beating his wife . He wanted his wife to divorce him and said he would continue to beat her until she followed his wishes . She had him arrested , and the court ordered him to pay $25 a week . This Mr. Marrelli refused to do , staying away from home to avoid being arrested again .

He then demanded that the social agency stop helping his wife so that she would be dependent upon him ; he wished either to return home , in which case he would support her , or to have a divorce . He was sent to jail for several months , after which he returned home . ( Vacillation . ) He stopped going to the saloon and soon moved his family to a better apartment , bought new furniture , and seemed on good terms with his wife . ( Attempted family reorganization . ) After a few months , Mr. Marrelli was again out of work , drinking much of the time , and beating his wife . Mrs. Marrelli had him arrested , whereupon he promised to pay her $25 per week , packed his clothes , and left her .

The consternation that many people now exhibit over the rather high rate of divorce in the United States might lead to the conclusion that divorce is a new social invention of the present age and that in past generations and centuries official termination of marriage had been unknown . This is not the case and , although we do not have statistics to prove the point , it seems certain that at some earlier periods in the history of western civilization divorces occurred with a frequency to match the present day divorce rates . If a time existed in the early history of mankind when there was no recognized marriage , then at that time there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If people mated without the formality of a ceremony , they would part with equal lack of formality . Divorce is a correlate of marriage ; it is found where marriage is found . Its form varies with the form of marriage ; its ease of attainment , with the meaning attached to marriage . When marriage is regarded by the cultural group as a personal arrangement , divorce tends to be easy of attainment and to rest more or less upon the individual wishes of husband and wife ; but when marriage is regarded as of social significance or as a sacrament , divorce is made difficult . But regardless of these differences , some provision for termination of marriage seems to be almost if not entirely universal . Lichtenberger , quoting Hobhouse , concludes that among preliterate tribes , there are a few groups ( 4 per cent ) with no provision for divorce , a moderate proportion ( 24 per cent ) in which divorce can be had for specified reasons , and many groups ( 72 per cent ) in which hushand and wife may become divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some preliterate groups divorce is effected unceremoniously through the simple act of separating and remarrying . Other preliterate groups provide some ceremony which will signify to he group that the marriage is ended and that husband and wife are I - reed from their obligations and are in a position to marry someone else . footnote22 J. P. Lichtenberger , Divorce : A Social Interpretation , Whittlesey , 1931 , p. 24. p 300 This ceremony may be a simple symbolic act or a formal declaration made before witnesses . In the Orient , according to both Chinese and Japanese law , divorce is allowed ; in earlier times it was almost exclusively the privilege of the husband.23 Among the Mohammedans the traditional position was that divorce was the privilege of the husband , although provision was made for the wife to procure a release from marriage under certain conditions . Even among the Hindus , who regarded marriage as a sacrament , under certain conditions a wife could be superseded by another wife although she could not be formally divorced by her husband and could not remarry . The Code of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stated the amount and type of financial provision to be made for the wife.24 As in most patriarchal societies , only the husband could obtain the divorce , but under some conditions the wife could leave her husband and demand that he divorce her . Among the Hebrews , another patriarchal group , the husband had the right to divorce his wife through the formality of writing out and handing her a bill of divorcement . No assigned causes are given in the early writings , and it is assumed that the husband could decide for himself when his marriage had reached an end . At a later period , wives could demand a divorce from their husbands for specified reasons : refusal of conjugal rights , impotence , loathesome disease , malodorous occupation , refusal of the husband to support his wife , desertion , apostasy , or licentiousness.2 " Among the Greeks , another patriarchal society , the husband had greater freedom of divorce than the wife . He might , upon occasion , dismiss his wife in the presence of witnesses because he thought her unattractive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for barrenness or adultery . The wife could not divorce her husband for adultery , even though long continued , but could procure a divorce if her husband neglected his family or was cruel . It was difficult for her to obtain a divorce , however , and after getting it her only course was to return to the family of her father or of a footnote23 For an extended summary of divorce practices , see G. E.

During this period marriage was , a family matter , based upon a contract and upon the payment of a dowry by the wife 's family ; divorce , too , was a family matter and could be had . by the husband only with the consent of a council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of all these groups , divorce had certain common characteristics . Related to a patriarchal form of family , divorce was the privilege of the husband . Even when the wife 's right to separation and remarriage was admitted , she could not obtain her freedom directly , but only by demanding that her husband divorce her . Adultery as a cause for divorce applied only to the misconduct of the wife ; adultery on the part of the husband was not a cause for divorce . Divorce was a private or family matter and did not have moral or religious connotations . All accounts agree that divorce occurred relatively infrequently in the groups with stable and well-organized patriarchal families . In the period following that of the stable patriarchal family , Rome illustrates one of the occasions upon which divorce became frequent . The account of the Roman family , given in chapter 3 , refers to the gradual breakdown of the patriarchal family during and following the period of the Punic wars and the increase of marriages entered into with a minimum of ceremony as private rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ceremony to a private , personal arrangement , divorce also gradually slipped from family control and became a private , informal transaction entered into by joint agreement of husband and wife without sanction of family or court . Divorces increased greatly in number . The early Christian attitude toward divorce , which gradually became accepted throughout Europe , seems to have been a mixture of idealism and of aversion to the laxness of marital life in Rome . Lifelong mo- footnote26 Willystine Goodsell , A History of the Family as a Social and Educational Institution , Macmillan , 1922 , pp. 96-98. 27 Goodsell , op. cit. , pp. 121-123.  | nogamy was established as the Christian ideal . During a period of several centuries , however , the church compromised with existing practices which regarded marriage as a civil contract , and permitted easy divorce and often polygamy . Gradually the church brought marriage under its control and declared it to be a sacrament and , as such , indissoluble . Gradually secular laws were brought into agreement with church laws . By the tenth century the Catholic teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil laws of every Catholic country.28 Nevertheless , compromises continued . For divorce there was substituted a formal separation called divortium a mensa et thoro , or divorce from bed and board . The marriage itself was not dissolved , and consequently remarriage was not permitted . This limited divorce could be obtained on the grounds of adultery , " spiritual adultery , " and cruelty . In addition , provision was made for annulment , if it could be shown that conditions existed at the time of marriage which , if known , would have made the marriage impossible . Fourteen such conditions , or impediments to marriage , were recognized , including impotency , disparity of worship , consanguinity , and affinity . When these conditions were shown to have existed at the time of marriage , the marriage was declared null and void from the beginning , that is , never really to have existed . After the annulment , the man and woman were free to marry someone else . With enough ingenuity , a cause for annulInent could be found in almost any marriage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages . The annulments were confined to the wealthy , however ; among the poor , sexual immorality was common.29 During the early Christian period and the middle ages , marriage became a religious ceremony , declared by many devotees of the church not to be valid unless performed by a priest . The pre-Christian concept of marriage as a civil contract was lost ; its reassertion came with the Reformation . Luther declared marriage to be a natural relationship between man and woman , to be entered into by a civil contract and of no concern to the church . For several centuries the Church of England footnote28 J. A. Ryan , " History of Marriage , " The Catholic Encyclopedia , Vol. 9 , pp , 693 ? 698 ? 29 F. H.

In an intermediate period that ended in 1857 , divorces were granted in England by an Act of Parliament ; naturally they were limited to the influential and the wealthy . Not until 1857 was divorce transferred from the ecclesiastical courts to the civil courts and then it could be granted only for a few causes . The husband could obtain a divorce if his wife committed adultery ; the wife , handicapped as in past ages , could obtain a divorce only if the husband in addition to adultery had been cruel or had deserted her for a period of two or more years . Additional grounds for divorce were added in 1937 : desertion , cruelty , and insanity.3o At the time that the American colonies were being settled , two conflicting ideas regarding divorce prevailed in England : that there could be no divorce since marriage was a sacrament ; and that marriage ( and hence divorce ) was a civil matter . The Puritans in New England followed Luther in believing that marriage was a civil contract which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of England and adopted its attitude that marriage was indissoluble and divorce impossible . The southern colonies however failed to establish ecclesiastical courts , which in England had handled separations and annulments ; nor did they assign such duties to the civil courts . Therefore , during the early colonial period , separations and annulments were impossible in the southern colonies , for no court had jurisdiction . New York made no provision for divorces , although a few were granted , presumably without legal authority , by the governor . Pennsylvania , by the Code of 1682 , recognized the right of divorce for adultery , but failed to give any court the power to grant such divorces . Gradually the attitude of the New England colonies spread , and marriage was accepted as a civil contract , although provision was made for the ceremony to be performed either by a civil officer or a clergyman . Divorce came to be accepted also as a civil act , terminating the marriage contract.31 footnote80 R. E. Baber , Marriage and the Family , McGraw-Hill , 1939 , pp. 497 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 447-31 Goodsell , op. cit. , pp. 377 ? 382.  | In the United States at the present time , one state , South Carolina , has no provision for divorce . Each of the other states sets its own grounds for divorce and establishes the conditions under which divorce will be granted . In general , the South is more conservative than the North , and the East is more conservative than the West in the provisions for divorce . The West was settled during a period when marriage was passing from community and family control and was becoming a private personal arrangement between one man and one woman . The divorce laws of the western states tend to reflect this conception of marriage and to make termination of this personal arrangement easier of accomplishment . Frequency of dissension . A public record is made of each divorce granted , and the number of divorces may therefore be stated . The amount of dissension is less easily estimated . One attempt to estimate the amount of dissension has been made by investigators who have tried to classify marriages as happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Southern California to rate their married friends with reference to whether they seemed to be happily married.32 A classification of 2,080 married men placed 58 per cent in the happily married group , 15 per cent in a doubtful group , and 27 per cent in an unhappy group ; a similar classification for 2,176 married women accorded happiness to 58 per cent , placed 15 per cent in a doubtful group , and 27 per cent in an unhappy group . Burgess and Cottrell obtained ratings from 526 couples as to their own happiness in marriage.33 Among 526 couples , 63 per cent gave self-ratings of being happy or very happy ; 14 per cent gave ratings of average happiness ; 22 per cent rated themselves as unhappy or very unhappy ; while i per cent did not rate themselves . These authors quote from an unpublished study by Dr. R. O. Lang in which college students rated their close friends on happiness : among 4,750 couples married from one to six years , 69 per cent were rated by their friends as happy or very happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unhappy or very unhappy . Terman had 792 married couples rate them- footnote32 Paul Popenoe and Donna Wicks , " Marital Happiness in Two Generations , " Mental Hygiene , 1937 , Vol. 21 , pp. 218-223. 33E . W. Burgess and L.

Although these estimates do not agree exactly , it seems probable that two thirds of all marriages are happy , about one fifth are unhappy , and about one seventh are borderline . Frequency of divorce . At the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorced women in the United States . These figures do not tell us how many people had been divorced , since many divorced persons remarry , but simply how many had been divorced and had not remarried . The divorced men constituted 1.1 per cent of all males fifteen years of age and over , and the divorced women constituted 1.3 per cent of all females fifteen years of age and over . Thus , at a given time , slightly over one per cent of the adult population has the status of divorced persons . Stated in relation to married persons rather than to the total adult population , in 1930 approximately one fiftieth as many persons were living divorced as were living in marriage . Divorces have been increasing in frequency . The ratio of divorces to the total population shows this clearly . Except for a dip downward in divorces during the depression of the early 1930 's , the trend has been steadily upward since the first figures were made available .
