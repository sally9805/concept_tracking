At his first press conference last week new OPA Boss Prentiss E. Brown admitted that prices would continue " an inevitable , slow , well-ordered rise . " This increase , he believed , would proceed at the current rate of one-half of 1% per month . <P> To those who have for some time realized that in fact ( if not in theory ) the Government is allowing an inflation to pay for part of the cost of the war , Prentiss Brown 's statement came as no surprise . The critical question , which Brown did not answer , was : what kind of an inflation will the Government allow ? <P> So far it has prided itself on holding down the price of many luxuries and semi-luxuries , where higher prices might play an effective role in checking consumer buying . But the prices of necessities ( especially farm prices ) have climbed steadily . Last week this dangerous trend continued . Though the Government at last got around to releasing Government-stocked wheat in order to hold down wheat prices , cotton quotations went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manhattan advanced 1 per quart . <P> Meanwhile , although Eastern gasoline prices probably will advance 1per gallon and wine prices were lifted slightly to cover higher transportation costs , the Government persisted in trying to hold its ceiling prices on most non-farm products and services , thus aiding &; abetting a wild buying boom ( see below ) . Strangest decision of all was that of the Federal Communications Commission , which proudly announced that it was saving the U.S. $34,700,000 per year by persuading American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. to cut its long-distance overtime rates at the very time when the company is far overburdened with long-distance calls . <P> The one flash of common sense on price economics came from the New York Daily News . In a down-to-earth editorial slugged " Do n't Buy A News-Borrow One , " America 's largest paper announced that in order to cut circulation it had doubled its Sunday price ( to 10 ) in Canada , would soon do likewise for its western circulation , and might in due course " bring the 10 price right up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisers will have to pay 10% more for space , reduce their space requirements on the average 10-15% . These changes , the News was quick to point out , will not result in " any perceptible net profits " : excess-profits taxes plus higher normal rates on corporate income will take care of that .
