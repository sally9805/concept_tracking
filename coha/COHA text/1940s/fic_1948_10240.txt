terrain . The men could leap over streams , crawl over abysses , and wade through swamplands where no pack animals could go . The heat grew more and more viscous ; it clung to our skin like a swarm of leeches . By noon our bodies were aching to the point of hysteria . Every step was agonizing . The great gnats came rushingtoward us , phalanx upon phalanx ; we scratched like maniacs until we were covered with blood . We came to a place where cattle hoofs had dug small holes in the ground , and each hole was filled with a festering , dung-tainted liquid . We were sick with thirst ; we lay flat on our bellies and drank . Far to the east rose a peak , salmon-hued and absolutely symmetrical , with a small bright nipple on top ; " Mount Abula , " said Bambo . Little hillocks and tussocks covered the plain . Again and again we sank to our knees in dark marshy hollows . The overloaded porters scrambled wearily back to their feet ; a reddish glaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go no farther . It was still early in the afternoon ; but Ndjoluva was suffering from nausea and one of the new men , Abuluru , was almost blind with insect bites . We reached a shady spot , strangely bucolic after all that squalor . A screen of creepers hung suspended among some palms . It was like a tent : a buzzing twilight enclosed us . Some fifty yards below , edged with a bank of golden convolvulus , lay a long narrow pool . The water was almost black . And as I stood there beside Momboola , staring down at the glassy surface , we looked almost like twins  --  equally dark , equally ugly . Bambo came running up . His hands were filled with a brown , mealy substance . " Tembo dung ! " he cried dramatically . " Tembo country ! Tembo tusks ! " Oudange was studying the ground and the trees beside the pool . He pointed casually as I came up . There , several feet over ourp51heads , an odd polish shone on the trunks : streaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bark . " Yes . Tembo , " he whispered , half in pride , half in alarm . Alessandro was finishing a sketch of the new boy , Osseladossa . The Negro had fallen asleep . His blue-turbaned head was resting on his shoulder . The portrait caught him just on the point of somnolence : the sulky , suspicious features were melting away in the fog of instinct . And somehow the tone of the portrait as well , the penchant of the artist , seemed to hover between distaste , even fear , and a warm , penetrating curiosity . Alessandro sighed and lit a cigarette . " I do n't know , " he said wearily ; " can we ever really touch them ? Can we ever really grasp them ? . . . There are times when I feel I 've almost hit on their secret . A bit more patience , more tenderness maybe , and the mystery will dissolve . But a moment later everything changes . They sulk . They begin to lie . They glide back into their watery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , tapping my forearm with his pencil . His eyes were shining tensely behind the cool , intellectual Roman mask . " You think the Negro is just a laughing , dancing child of nature ? You think he is simple ? You think he is free ? Listen , my dear Sambula . Their lives are crumbling about them ; their malaise is even deeper , even more sickening than our own . We 've broken them with our taxes . We 've wounded them with our scorn . We 've terrorized them with blows . We 've poisoned them with gonorrhea . We 've locked them up in distant garrisons and let them die on distantbattlefields . And what have we given them in return ? What , exactly ? Civilization ! The fruits of European wisdom  --  a bit wormeaten , perhaps , but glorious , nevertheless . The privilege of forsaking their gods , their tribal magic , their homes and occupations . . . . And now they live in utter absurdity and decay . We 've stopped calling them slaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've treated as beasts have finally turned into beasts . And those we 've called murderers have turned into murderers . Wait and see . Ah , Sambula , you think that they love you ? Or may someday learn to love you ? No , no . They may cling to you , they may flatter you and paw you . But in their heart there 's nothing but fear . Nothing but a deep , devouring hatred .... " The evening shadows were rising on Mount Abula . A haze of crimson clung to the slowly widening darkness . It was like a veil ; a veil of blood cast over a world of cunning . Great steely birds were flying toward the cast ; toward Abyssinia . Their wings passed like knives over the listless water . On and on , deeper and deeper . I counted them ; seventeen . Long after they were gone the leaves still stirred with the breath of their wings . Yes , there still were moments of lucidity , like a door cast wide open , when l suddenly felt remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great and tranquilizing distance , and saw new perspectives , new nuances of human feeling . I saw it bathed in the light of the inchoate , the uncategorized . Everything was still . The air began to sing . ' Mc slopes cast off a cool blue glow . And Africa herself turned into a hidden voice , a pantheistic song of infinite subtlety and sadness . The shadows crept higher and higher on Mount Abula . Only the crest , like a great wave , still sprang from the gulf of shadow . The last veins of light still danced on the summit . Then they died , like ripples sinking along the edge of a beach . The men sat mutteringunder the trees . Momboola was undoing the ropes , and Osseladossa was building a fire . Tiny Bambo was piercing a boil on Ndjoluva 's shoulder . A wail rose from somewhere in the south , among the tussocks . Some more birds were passing  --  eleven of them , this time.  |p53Maburu  crept up and sat beside me , at a humble distance . Alessandrohad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast about her hips like a shawl ; it looked splendid against the smooth black marble of her skin . She glanced shyly at me with her wild huge eyes , then quickly away again . She lowered her head intently and drew an oval in the sand with her forefinger  --  her left one . Then she said , almost inaudibly : " You 'll go back to America ? By and by ? " I looked at the hill and nodded . " Africa , " she whispered , " is not rich enough ? Not clever enough ? Not like N'Yuruka ? " I shook my head ; and I began to tell her about N'Yuruka . " It 's not a real city , Maburu . It 's a rocky island which has turned into a great prison . Everything leaps and roars and plunges in N'Yuruka , struggling to escape . " " Do they ever escape ? By and by ? " " They do n't really want to escape . Their rocky prison is the heart of the world . " " Did they steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , I suppose .... " But what I felt was very different . Love ? Hatred ? Both , of course . And also sadness , a sense of tragically wasted energies and powers . It was neither a city nor a prison ; it was only a hallucination , glittering like Everest , bellowing like Niagara , dry and simmering like the Gobi . And there the somnambulists wandered  --  up and down those mountain passes , in and out of those arid wastes which they called Madison , Lexington , Fifth ; up and down those creaking stairs , in and out of musty rooms , in and out of creaking beds , in and out of musty hearts ; struggling to rediscover the laws of nature , and plunged , before they knew it , into a howling sandstorm , or an avalanche . " Maburu has no home now , " she whispered suddenly . " Maburu will go on a ship to N'Yuruka . " She lowered her eyes and turned her dark little head away.  |p54I  leaned over and touched her shoulder : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked at me with a curious , almost telepathicalarm . Her lips parted slowly ; her white teeth sparkled . Then she leapt up and away , darting like an animal through the trees . At dawn Oudange touched me on the forehead and beckoned . I followed him noiselessly through the misty trees . Down at the edge of the pool , their bodies blurred by the early mist , two bull elephants were standing ; one old and one young . They filled their trunks with water , then slowly raised their heads with an air of meditation , and poured the water down their throats . They looked utterly unlike the mild , half-humanized elephants of India : they were huge , with tiny and malevolent eyes , immense , nervous cars , and almost no forehead at all . There was a dangerously sensitive , capricious air about them . They flapped their great leafy cars and strutted lazily up the shore . They wound their trunks around the grass , tugged , and swirled it through the air with a flourish . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They paused , standing affectionately side by side , head against head , interweaving their trunks . The mist faded . We could see them more clearly . Their dull , sagging hides were lightly silvered with the morning clew . A look of irony , just faintly irritable , crept into their eyes ; they began to push one another , with a kind of erudite playfulness . Men the older one raised his trunk in a delicate swanlike movement , feeling for the unfamiliar scent in the breeze . They grew alert : their eyes grew evil . And they turned , with ominous dignity , and disappeared beyond the trees.  |p55This  at last was the real forest ; the real bottomless wood , filled with an everlasting flicker of scents and echoes . We followed Oudange up a narrow , almost invisible path . The leaves brushed our shoulders like endless curtains . Tiny , tassel-eared monkeys were loping through the foliage overhead , with scandalized little cries and catcalls . Green parakeets fluttered by , whistling insanely ; and now and then a tufted cockatoo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely everywhere , hung the tyranny of the insect ; hordes of flies , gnats , ants , moths , beetles , phasmids and mantises . And others as well : the delicate neptulix and tortrix , some like miniature dragons or reptiles , others like chips of gold or enamel , or flakes of iridescent bronze . We rested in a glade , and the supple Ramazana climbed a tree ; he ran up the smooth pearly bark like a lizard . " What do you see , Ramazana ? " There was no reply . Ramazana sat perched among the leaves , hands folded and eyes closed . Ile wore long golden earrings : they glittered in the sunlight . " Do you see nothing , Ramazana ? " " Nothing at all , " chanted Ramazana . " Nothing at all . " " Well , sing us a song , Ramazana. "  | Ramazana began to sing . He had an odd thin voice , like a mouth organ . The words , in a Bantu dialect , were very hard for me to follow . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness that covered the world ; about the coming of the fish , who brought their phosphorescence into the seas ; and the coming of the beasts , who brought their tawny brightness to the woods ; and the coming of the birds , who filled the air with a feathery dazzle . The darkness began to writhe like a dying snake . It dried up ; it fell away . And a mighty tide of color and warmth , of light and love filled the world . The song came to an end , in a sudden rush of melancholy notes . " Yes ? And what happened then ? " shouted Momboola . " What happened after that ? " " Nothing , " chanted Ramazana , closing his eyes again , like a turtle , and shaking his earrings . " Nothing , nothing at all . " The sun was very low when we came to Kungawali . This was the seventh clay of our journey . The land was growing hotter ; stranger ; wilder . The village , from a distance , looked like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked like a sponge . From every little cavity a face was furtively peering . It was bathed in the last rich brilliance of the sun ; it looked mythological , slightly evil . Then we entered the place . A vast procession of natives lay scattered along the path . It was appalling . Everything was there ; every shade of deformity and decay . Children covered with running sores , girls with hollows instead of eyes , every gradation of sleeping sickness , syphilis , locomotor ataxia . Gnarled old men ridden with warts and twisted women caked with clay , all lay beside the path , muttering and imploring . For what ? God only knows . For the white man 's magic ; for little pink capsules and bottles and jars ; for infinitesimal symbols of love and concern . One girl had a rarep57thing called mossy-foot elephantiasis : a hideous suppurating growth which covered her vast , clublike feet . More and more of them came limping and crawling out of their caves . It was an absolute jungle , a kaleidoscope of human anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless whimper , the unspeakable stench ; it was all like a colossal ulcer . A strange man now came up to us , bowed low , and extended his arms : the chief , apparently . The others watched tensely , raising their hands , mumbling with veneration . He seemed more than a chief , almost a god . He was a tall albino Negro  --  ash-blond , with reddened eyes , and dirty gray skin covered with crimson patches . He addressed us in a clear and beautiful Kiswahili , which we all understood ; the rest of the village spoke a kind of Bangala . He gazed at us quietly . " We know why you have come , " he murmured , turning to Alessandro , whom he took to be our leader . " Yes ? " said Alessandro cautiously . " Why have we come ? " " To buy the souls of our dead , " sighed the albino . " You will pack them in your little boxes and take them back home . " Alessandro assured him that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconvinced . " We are the oldest people in Africa , " he said impressively ; " we in Kungawali . We were here even before the pygmies , before the leopards , before the frogs . " He paused . The stricken villagers had gathered about him , crouching and clinging . None of them quite understood ; but they kept on listening breathlessly . " Once , " the albino went on , " everything lived under the ground , as you know . We , the people of Kungawali , were right here , inside this hill . Slowly we dug our way to the surface . You can still see the holes . And so we were the first people to sec the sun and the moon and the jungle . Oh yes , we 're very old . Too old , perhaps . Too weary . We keep on having babies , " he confessed morosely , " but not with much enthusiasm . Yes , we 're much too old , I 'm afraid . "  | The air was fetid all around us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contamination as well . Their eyes , dimmed with suffering , looked gray and a little mad . They had the air of narcotic patients , or victims of dementia praecox . But what was really most shocking was the residue of health , the touch of humanity that still clung to them . They watched us with a childish , yearning curiosity ; they stared at our garments , touched our shoes , sniffed at our bags , peered in our boxes . They begged us for gifts  --  food , medicine , anything . But we could n't stop ; there was nothingwe could do . They followed us down the path , clutching at our arms , gesticulating feebly . ' Ulm , one by one , they gave up and crept back into their caves . Only the albino stayed outside , on top of the rock , standing on one leg like a heron . When the path turned we glanced back . IIe was still there , quite motionless ; a mysterious lonely figure , an archaic effigy . Balibobotec came limping through the dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit his cigarette ; a glow shone on his soft indulgent face . lie narrowed his eyes and belched tactfully , with his finger placed against his lips , and proceeded to chat in his Ivory Coast French . " You arc a strong man , " he observed , touching my arm with his fat blue fingers . " You have fine white teeth . And a fine small belly . But your cars , my dear Sambula . They lack dignity , I 'm afraid . Your nose lacks distinction . Your hair is untidy . To be perfectly frank , you look a bit odd . You are kind , you are strong . But , " he paused significantly , " you are very far from beautiful , Sambula . You will not be a success with the ladies of the Congo . " He took a puff , and shook the ashes daintily with his little finger . " To be a success with the equatorial girls , Sambula , you must let Balibobotee help you . I will pluck the hairs from your chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will teach you a poemp59or two in Swahili . . . . Or perhaps , " he added slyly , " you do n't care for the equatorial ladies ? " A bird swept out of the branches with a hoarse low cry ; a small , undistinguished bird with speckled gray wings . It flew in a circle , then up and away to the east . Balibobotee placed his hand on my shoulder . " Look , " he whispered . " The demon bird , Sambula . . .. " I looked about with concern . It was growing dark very swiftly . " Oh , " said Balibobotee , " it wo n't harm you . Do n't be nervous . It harms only the women . . . . If a demon bird , " he said judiciously , " flies over a woman 's head , from west to east , she ceases to menstruate . She dries up . She grows sterile . " He crushed his cigarette and folded his hands ; and he began to smile  --  a slow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees and poured out the brandy . A sudden coolness touched the air . It was like a wind from the Kulanwili . " Listen , " said Marius suddenly . " Did you hear something , Sambula ? " I listened . " No . Nothing at all , " I said . " Was it thunder ? " said Marius . " It sounded like thunder . " I listened again ; no , there was n't a sound . Marius 's eyes were glittering . He raised his hand , clutching the brandy glass . Carmencita , the monkey , leapt to his shoulder . " Something is happening , " he whispered . " Yes . Something crucial . Do you ever have a sense of things getting out of control ? Of the world spinning around crazily , faster and faster ? Of the mountains splitting , of the ocean ready to burst ? . . . What is it ? This shadow that hangs over the world ? Something 's crouching behind the curtain , ready to spring . Do n't you feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny glasses . Marius looked startled ; he glanced behind him , then up at thep6o stars . His thick oily curls were hanging over his forehead , like a bullock 's . His temples were throbbing ; his cheeks were bright with sweat . " Yes , Alessandro , " he said feverishly , pointing a trembling forefinger . " You think the world is exhausted . Ready to fall asleep quietly . You are an aristocrat ; a Dresden figurine . But Joshua is hopeful . He has faith . He has charity . He believes in science  --  test tubes and the rest . Look at him ! I le 's been living in a test tube ! He thinks that man will crush the invisible beast , and finally emerge into everlasting harmony . And Sambula ; God knows what Sambula thinks . IIe sits and grins like a Chinese Buddha . He is resigned , he accepts everything . IIe 's like a great warm sponge . All is nature ; all is for the best . Is that it , Sambula ? You think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? And keep on on forever falling and rising ? " The monkey leaned down and dipped her finger in his brandy glass ; she tasted it , shuddered , and dipped it again . " And you , Marius ? What do you think ? " " Think ? " he snarled . " I think nothing . I see a chasm . That 's all . Just a bottomless chasm . " We sat in silence . The monkey drew her fingers over Marius 's brows ; she plucked very lightly at his lashes . " Listen , you fools ! " bellowed Marius , utterly drunk ; he raised his great clenched fist in the air . " There you sit , like three venerable owls . But you know nothing ! Nothing ! You 're like worms , all three ' of you , tucked in your little cocoons , spinning silk while the world is disintegrating . Look into your souls for a change ! ' What do you see ? " IIe grew rigid suddenly . " Listen .... Do you hear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind us , ever so faintly , something stirred . But the sound died away . The night hung deep and still . Marius nodded heavily , while Carmencita stroked his neck . She toyed with his earlobe ; she tugged at it ; then she bit it . Marius seized her by the head , twisted her neck , and hurled her to the ground.  |p61She  lay twitching and spluttering , then subsided ; she was dead . And then a strange thing happened . None of us moved . But far behind us , from the very penetralia of the wood , it seemed , a long sigh issued forth ; a deep , liturgical rustle . And as we watched a whole cortege of tiny apes appeared in the trees . They leapt from bough to bough , their eyes sparkling in the firelight . They drew closer ; they were uttering a thin , coughing noise , a kind of spectral lamentation . They stared down at us with an air of ritualistic grief . They grew still , plunged in mourning . They folded their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible signal , they slipped away through the trees and vanished. pIt was a green shaggy dawn . The sun was like a goldfish , floating belly upward in the poisonous haze . Balibobotec came waddling down the path , snapping his yellow braces disconsolately . " Good morning , Balibobotec . " " Mm , " he grunted caustically . " ' Today it will come , Sambula . " " What will conic ? " He glanced wearily at the sun and tapped his nose with a jaded air . " ' The sky is swollen , Sambula . It is heavy with child , ready to burst . Yes , today it will come . " A malignant halo had enveloped the sun when we reached Nulabc . The sky was taking on a fierce , palpitating sheen . The village was steeped in apathy . They all pretended not to see us : no one spoke . Out of fear , perhaps . Or out of a desperate indolence , more likely . Two grizzly old hunters were squatting in the shade rolling dice . A huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving an orange mat . Beside him sat a man without legs , gazing glassily into space and humming . Near by lay a boy in his teens plunged in infinite languor and dangling a bright red string over his navel . I felt slightly better , after a feverish night ; but weak , a bit dizzy . Joshua had given me ten grains of aspirin and ten of quinine ,  |p63and  a jigger of brandy . My shirt was soaking : yet I felt cool . I glanced at the thermometer . It was 111  --  . After leaving Nulabe we entered a smooth gray valley . The oppressionkept growing . An evil weight hung over the land , everythinglooked dark and supine . Then we entered a stretch of wood . A rapid shudder ran over the leaves . The branches grew luminous  --  not with the light of the sun , but with a cool fungoid radiance which rose from the earth . The grasses began to sway . The frogs rang out in the distance . Then something happened ; some inaudible signal behind the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect , alert . A buzzing tremor filled the air , like a swarm of bees . The frogs grew suddenly still ; there was n't a sound . Nimbalimba was rolling his eyes and swaying miserably to and fro . And then , out of the very pit of stillness , flowed a sound . A mere sigh , it seemed at first ; I could hardly hear it . It rose gently , gatheredthe whole silence of the forest in its grip , paused , and then widened into a low , dark roar . A theatrical hush hung in the air : a vast curtain seemed about to rise . ' We came hastily to a halt among some low thick tamarisks . The porters clung together in a murmuring tangle . There was a strange new smell about them , like ammonia ; the smell of alarm . The air grew dark abruptly , as though a switch had been cut off . A stealthy little wind came slithering through the trunks . It halted ; it reared ; the tongue flickered lightly . Then it passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphorous behind it . The light now turned into a dim watery blue . The wood was like an enormous grotto , caught in the roar and rush of the sea . Then I heard a patter among the leaves , a whimsical staccato , like the leaping of grasshoppers . Hundreds ; then thousands ; closer and closer.  | The first drops fell . They lit on my hand , huge and warm . Then they closed in swiftly , soft as petals at first , then more and more violent . The trees sobbed and shivered . Ndjoluva seized my arm and clung to me violently . He looked like a lunatic . Momboola was running to and fro , waving his arms . A wind came charging down on us , enraged and ponderous , like a great buffalo . Dust and leaves shot from the ground . A distant scream rose high above us . I was seized with a fit of vertigo and had to lie down . My brain seemed ready to burst . My joints were on fire . A curious new melody came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of a huge violin . Subdued at first , almost plaintive : then more and more shrill : soon it grew intolerable , like a knife drawn across porcelain . And then it struck , like a cobra . A great white vein shot through the sky . Everything quivered internally , the very marrow of things was pierced . The tension crumbled ; the sky dissolved . The air grew streaming and silvery with rain . And the thunder came galloping heavily toward us , rumbling and rolling , wave upon wave . Oudange had thrown a sheet of oilcloth over the boxes ; he fastened another between two branches , to form a sloping roof . Here we sat , watching and listening . The ache and weariness vanished . A wonderful lightness , a delicious sense of relief took hold of us . The Negroes lost their fear , their teeth and eyes were sparkling . The thunder swept past , like waves storming a mountainside . The echo flowed on , mile after mile , casting its web through the distant hollows , grew finely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . Streaks of light kept writhing through the sky in the east ; each reaching into higher , still more resonant distances , exposing still wilder , still more towering facades of cloud . The rain came plungingin a fierce flattening onrush , and through the spasms of lightningthe world shot forth like a cataract . Nothing , absolutelyp65nothing was visible but water ; a steaming curtain of rain ripped by the boughs into millions of tassels . Now everything grew subdued . The rain fell thin and steady . The thunder died in the distance and the lightning flickered faintly at the other end of the valley . The sting and caprice went out of the storm . The natives had stripped their loincloths and rolled them in a bag . Ndjoluva and Nimbalimba ran out and danced in a frenzy of joy . Their black leaping bodies sparkled with veins of water . Osseladossa and Momboola set about pitching the tent ; they dug a narrow channel around it and pointed the low-roofed flank toward the rain . Then the rain died altogether . A great cool stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by innumerable tricklings . The ground was soft and spongy ; the flattened grasses began to rise . And then , as Balibobotee began to pluck the guinea fowl , we saw a touch of the evening sun flash through the dripping trees . The next morning the sun shot forth again , but only for a moment . It pierced the clouds like a great needle , covered the ground with a thick steam , and drew a bittersweetness from the blossoming thorn trees . The drought was gone . Everything was swarming . All over the hillside little torrents were welling forth , twisting and shining like braids of platinum . The virulent dampness had seized us during the night . Our clothes hung green and moldy , and the metal was stained with verdigris . Hundreds of centipedes , spiders , yellow bugs and white ants were crawling busily through the tent . I found Maburu under a tamarisk , fast asleep . The white shawl had fallen away from her body , like petals from a stamen . Her lips were parted , her hands lay curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep hung about her . A wet leaf clung to her belly ; it rose and fell with her breath . I leaned over her and peered at the coils of her ears , the wrinkled palms of her hands , the small maroon nipples , the thick vein stirring in her throat ; all deep and dark with slumber , like leaves at the bottom of a pool . I touched her forehead with a blade of grass , and drew it down over her nose . She sneezed , opened her eyes , and peered at me gravely . " Tell me , Sambula , " she said , frowning a bit , " out there beyond Libreville ; there 's nothing but water ? " " Nothing but water , " I admitted . " Till you reach Brazil . " " And after Brazil ? " " Hills , jungle , and more water . " " And then ? " " Hundreds of islands . Large and small . Australia . India . " " Ah , " she said , rather hopelessly . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Africa ? Is there another Africa ? " I pointed out , rather halfheartedly , that the world was round ; that by going westward , on and on , she would eventually come back to the Congo . " Well , " she said unhappily , " what if I go toward Kooma ? " She pointed to the north . " On and on ? What then ? " " Well , after the sands , and more water , and various hills and peninsulas , and then still more water , you 'll come to a place where the water has turned to stone . And where the rain turns to white dust . Everything is white up there : whiter than ivory . No snakes , no insects . Everyone cats fish and shivers with cold . " " Ah , well , " said Maburu , smiling reproachfully as she cast the white cloth around her hips ; " now tell me something true , Samhula . About a true place . And true people . . .. " We sauntered through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere there were signs of frantic activity , an infuriated buzzing and fluttering and burrowing . I told Maburu about America ; about the beaches of Florida and the lakes of 7Maine , about the plains of Texas and the swamps of Louisiana . " Wait , wait , " said Maburu suddenly . Two feet away , in a damp hollow beneath a fallen trunk , lay a nest of tiny , reddish , exquisitely patterned snakes . They were stirring very slowly , raising their heads , darting their tongues . They began to writhe more and more swiftly as we watched . There were hundreds of them , poisonous squirming little strands woven into a damp , abominable knot . I noticed a scent of potassium . My lips were twitching , my skin was puckering . " Come , " said Maburu passionately . " They 'll creep into your sleep , Sambula . . . . " She took me by the arm and drew me violently away . It was the first time she had touched me . And suddenly I understood . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung reflected in thousands of little pools  --  among the ferns , between the roots , beside the stones , beneath the lily pads . All the squalor of the Congo had fallen away , like a dead skin . The air was pure as glass and a mossy coolness filled the valley . Everything was secretly swelling and burrowing through the darkness . I grew alert . There was a stirring in the elephant grass near by , Not the wind ; not a beast . The human flavor was there . I felt it instantly . And an uncontrollable pang of yearning shot through me . I closed my eyes ; my heart was pounding . " Come , " I whispered . " Come , Maburu . . . . Come . Come . Come . " She leaned over me quietly . Her shawl fell away . She slid into my arms without a word . As I drew her close against me I felt the whole night flow through us , all weariness glide away , all loneliness vanish . I felt I was treading on air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , a moment later I felt sick at heart ; pierced with a sadness that bordered on terror . Happiness . What is it ? How do we find it ? Where shall we look for it ? Or has it slipped forever from the face of the earth ? A look , a touch , a whisper  --  only in retrospect do they begin to glow . And then we decide , rather desperately , to call them happiness . But they were n't happiness when they happened ; they were closer to pain . And they do n't turn into happiness later ; they still are pain , nothing but pain . The strange necessity grows on us little by little , and soon we can hardly tell one from the other . The ache and the joy have grown inseparable . The longing itself becomes a treacherousfulfillment . And finally nothing is left but the memory , like a wisp of hair or a crumbling rose . The leap of life has faded utterly . Only the horrible search remains  --  that , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills fell away , the land declined into a muddy monotony . We could feel the very texture of sunlight changing . It was no longer crisp and piercing , like a knife . It was a boiling web , insidious , suffocating . The whole savannah had turned into a swamp , a hissing onrush of procreation which saturated every inch . Millions of larvae in the pools ; millions of beetles in the grass ; millions of flies and mosquitoes filling the bright wet air . And above all the gnats . They soon grew intolerable . They shot around us in clouds , small opalescent sparks , incredibly swift and unbearably venomous . They began settling by the dozen the moment we entered the shade ; and then sprang away , leaving a drop of blood and a sting like fire . Our arms and legs grew bright as balloons . As the sun crawled higher they began to vanish and we wandered in peace for an hour or two . But then , as we approached the River , and felt the stirring of distant waters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies that buzzed like bumblebees and clung like idiots till we crushed them . The Negroes , it seemed , had become quite immune to them . They covered Momboola like a coat of mail , yet he did n't even bother to brush them off . But poor Joshua 's little round face was almost unrecognizable ; his cheeks were spattered with scarlet swellings . Marius 's huge hairy body was dappled with blood . Nothinghelped ; the lotions were utterly useless . We wandered on in a shuddering frenzy until , after an hour or so , these insects too began drifting away . But the maddening itch remained . Every obstacle grew infuriating ; every triviality grew mountainous . Our faults began to blossom like jungle parasites . Alessandro grew shrill with bitterness and despair . Marius sank into a sadistic rage ; and I was lost in a stupor of self-commiseration . Only Joshua continued meekly , without a word . Or was he yielding , possibly , to the most insidious vice of all ? As for the Negroes , they all grew still and sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew very well what usually followed them : a sudden collapse ; or , still worse , a fit of violence . " Be calm , " said Osscladossa in his great purring voice . " Soon we come to the River , bwana . " And a certain awe came over us . The River Spirit was whispering . I could smell the reeds and the rolling waters . We stopped for a rest and Balibobotee brought us a kettle of tea . The heat was still blistering . We kept fanning ourselves with palm leaves . ' There was a flurry among the mangroves : someone began to cry . Nimbalimba came running up with a wild look in his eyes . " Come , Jassa ! " he shouted . " Come , come , Assanda ! " Bambo , the crippled boy , was lying among some bushes , grovelingin the mud and foaming at the mouth . His great shirt clung tangled around his neck . The rest of the Negroes stood in an awed , murmuring circle . The boy 's face was twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his throat , great drops ofp71blood shone on his fingernails . His mouth was thrust open , gaspingfor breath , coughing , spitting : his jaws were trembling and clicking like a dog 's . The spasms then traveled swiftly downward through his body . His face grew relaxed . His belly began to writhe , and then his thighs . He excreted ; he ejaculated ; his legs shook like a spastic 's . Then he closed his eyes and fell in a dead stupor . No one raised a finger to help him . They were all afraid to touch him . Osseladossa kept whispering : " It 's the crocodiles , bwana . The wicked Crocodile Spirit ... " Ten minutes later the boy seemed completely recovered . he rose , shook himself with a guilty air , and crept obsequiously toward Joshua . " Give me a new name , Jassa , " he whispered shamefacedly . He clung gently to Joshua 's arm and pressed his tattooed face against Joshua 's shoulder . " Why do you need a new name , Bambo ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , Jassa ! No ! .. Give me a new name , quickly ! " " Call him Kayala , " suggested Oudange . " Call him Bing'yili , " said Osseladossa sullenly . " Call him Moughan'bamgouyala , " said Ndjoluva , rolling his doelike eyes . " You see , " sighed Balibobotee , " you must change his name . With his old name he was seized by the wicked spirits . Better let the old name die . Eliminate the wicked spirits . Call him something else , Jassa . " " Very well , " said Joshua mildly . " We 'll call you Kayala . " Bambo beamed . " Now I 'm Kayala , " he said , with an air of triumph on his froglike face . Half an hour later I offered him a cigarette . " Ilere , Bambo , " I said . He rolled his eyes and began to shudder . He seemed on the verge of another fit . " No , no , " I said hastily . " Now you are Kayala . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful sigh.  | But the next day everyone had forgotten all about it . Everyone called him Bambo again . " There , " said Oudange quietly . The foliage fell away . Yes , there it was , drab and elephantine , rolling lazily at our feet . " At last , " groaned Alessandro , and collapsed down on the shore . The waters were syrupy , unrippled , emerald-green . Yet the effect somehow was one of darkness , agitation . A purple vapor hung over the opposite shore . Oudange pointed . There , a mile or so downstream , we could see some low gray roofs . " Ndessa , " said Oudange . This was where the river boat called . Upstream , near our own shore , some men were fishing in a canoe . Ndjoluva tore off his loincloth and signaled to the fishermen . Half an hour later we crossed ; the four of us , with Oudange , in a small gray canoe , the rest of the men with their loads in two very large ones . It was growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oarsmen began to sing in their mighty voices to the long low rhythm of the oars . One of them sang the solo ; a tremendous bass ; and the reply came over the water from a many-voiced choir . They sang and sang . Their song filled the night , it explored the river like a fisherman 's net and rose like a tower into the sky . What were they singing ? None of us knew . And still , somehow or other , all of us knew . They sang of the very beginning of the world , when man crept out of the darkness ; and of the very end of the world , when man crept back into darkness . And as they sang I began to understand . For them the end of the world was the beginning ; and the beginning of the world was also the end . All things were the beginning , all things were the end . And so , in the very end there was neither end nor beginning . Yes , that was the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ? Anything beyond this inarticulate rush of sadness  --  sadness identified with exultation , and infinite joy with infinite terror ? Now the opposite shore drew near ; and withdrew into **25;3291;TOOLONG . We caught a glimpse of the giant creepers , the ivied network , the endless barricade of mangroves . And then it all melted into a dead wall of green . A tremendous calm enveloped us ; a living , calculating calm . The water , in the blood-red light , seemed to be seething with nerves . It grew darker and darker . The stars sprang out of the sky and swarmed through the ripples like bees in a hive . We were almost touching the northern shore ; but now it was completely invisible . There was nothing but the jetblackwater swarming with stars , the splash of the oars and the song of the oarsmen , and the needling whine of a million mosquitoes . And under it all , a deep rich rumble , a growl from the very heart of the world . The village doctor met us at the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate little goatee and the air of a field marshal . He led us up a path toward his veranda for a drink . Then he told us his story over a bottle of rum and a globe of cheese . On a sunny morning , ten years ago , a band of Falangists drove up to his estate near Cordoba . One of them , a certain LieutenantGomez , with the face of a wolf , rose in the courtyard and violently harangued the assembled peasants . Then he ordered five members of the family to be shot . Two days later a band of Communistsarrived . One of them , a local cobbler named Diaz , with a face like a lizard 's , hurled a diatribe at the collected servants , and ordered the rest of the family to be hanged . Then the house was burned down . Only the old grandmother survived , sitting fast asleep under an orange tree ; and Costello himself , crouching deep in the sherry cellar . " And that 's that , " he snarled . " Here I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Africa . I 'm beginning to think my family got the best of the bargain ! " A group of natives lay dozing under the shrubs near the veranda . Patients , said Costello , waiting for treatment in the morning.  | They were all suffering from the same affliction : elephantiasis of the testes . A very common ailment hereabouts , Costello murmured . Most of the victims had come from the great surrounding forests ; three of them had crept all the way from the sultanate of Rafai . They were impotent ; that 's the only reason they came : their seed lay buried in vast sheets of conjunctive tissue . The lamplightfiltered through the screen across their monstrous bodies . Huge plum-colored sacks were resting between their legs , like slumbering baboons . " Yes , it 's here in the Congo , " said Costello wearily , " that the heart of the misery lies ; the core of the great African failure . The River 's useless . Things rot . Nothing stirs . The land 's like a dead colon , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these vast , sluggish distances . ' Hie climate withers them . The tsetse poisons them . The Church bullies them . The government robs them . And what 's left is mercifully killed off by sheer annihilating boredom . So there you are . Is there hope for the future ? Who cares ? I do n't . I 'm sick of it all . If a whirlpool were to suck the whole gangrenous continent under the sea  --  well , let me tell you , it would be a blessing ! We 've made a mess of it , gentlemen . An unmitigated debacle ! " He sat suddenly rigid , Tic seemed to be listening . I listened , too . But I heard nothing . Nothing except that bottomless palpitation , that drumlike throbbing of the River . I looked through the screen ; no one was stirring . An electrical spasm shot over his face : a look of excoriating anguish , or maybe ecstasy  --  impossible to tell . But there it was , like an ominous shifting of the sands , an imperceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The senility was all there ; the moral deliquescence . We started off toward the inn with Oudange leading the way . It lay a mile down the shore , Costello told us : we could n't miss it . The Gnats 75p75Maburu crept out of the darkness and slipped her hand into mine . It seemed to melt in my grasp . I paused among the shrubs ; and as I drew her closer , I felt the whole wild tension of her body  --  the yearning , the misery , the panic , the adoration  --  all melt in a hot gloom which was like the midnight itself . Then she slipped back into the shadows without a word , her white shawl gleaming among the trunks like a ghost . Marius came up and walked heavily beside me . The glow of his cigarette kept trembling in his hand . For a while he said nothing ; the tip of the cigarette shone in his eyes . Then he growled : " Tell me . Have I changed , Sambula ? " " Changed ? Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path curved , the trees opened , and the River flashed beside us . Again I heard the low , accelerating drumbeat of the current . The starlight fell on Marius : he was dark and dripping . His face was twisted , he seemed on the verge of tears . The scar on his brow looked as though it were bleeding . " What 's the matter with me ? " he whispered . " I feel possessed . I 'm losing control . " He drew his hand down over his face , blinked his eyes and stared at the ground . " Listen , Sambula , " he said huskily . " You think I 'm a fool . You think I 'm a brute and a bully . You think I 'm a sadist . Very well . I am . But listen ! There are times , I tell you , when I 'd like to sink into the earth , just vanish forever , become part of the mud and sand , and forget that a wretch like Marius ever existed ! Yes , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My face disgusts me when I look in the mirror . I feel nauseated when I look at my body . I keep thinking of death . Yes , the thought of death clings to me and coils around me , glides in and out of my brain like an eel . My own death . Your death . Joshua 's death . Alessandro 's death . How magnificent , I keep thinking , just to make a clean sweep of it , end it all , slip quietly away from this feverish existence ! That 's what I keep thinking . Yes . Blood , nothing but blood . That 's the only cure ! The only reality . . . " His voice died away ; he seemed utterly exhausted . He hung his head and stumbled on like a blind old man . Oudange quietly raised his arm . " The River Men , " he whispered . The moon had finally risen . We were standing on the edge of a small sandy tributary . The ceremony had begun . Dark muscular shapes crept from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and joined an undulatingcolumn . They passed down the bank and slowly toward the River . They wore glittering masks of blue and purple ; and were laden with silver anklets and amulets and the long silver knives of the River fetishists . The sound of the drums was deep and steady : the men began to sway in unison . It seemed monotonous , desultory . And then quite unexpectedly , as a cloud covered the moon , an effect of peculiar , terrifying beauty was captured . The individual shapes melted away . They were no longer men , they were waves . And the procession dissolved in a strange fluvial harmony . The Divine Force of the River was entering them . Ripples of movement passed through them , slowly at first and then more quickly , and then the moon crept out and shone on a great silver phallus which was moving uneasily toward the slopes of the River . Now and again we saw their faces ; they were wet and distorted . The Divine Force was rising to a climax , apparently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bit by bit , to a great collective orgasm . Everything flashed ; the knives , the amulets . The silver phallus reared and plunged . The drumbeats quickened to a continual throb . Then they died away wearily , and the fetishists stumbled and fell to the ground like epileptics . The knives were dropped ; the silver phallus was cast among the reeds . And a great musky stillness passed through the air.  |p77We  crept on through the thicket . The air was paralyzed with stillness ; not the stillness of peace but a dense , combustible stillness . All of nature lay caught in a cataleptic trance . The crickets were squealing with a panicky incessance . And everywhere hung this intolerable bouquet , faintly sulphurous and deathly , like a whiff from a crematorium . Somewhere , down by the rushes , some great reptile was stirring . An owl fluttered past ; or something like an owl . And the stillness deepened . It grew almost tangible . We felt we were creeping into the heart of a tornado . " Look , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light among the boughs . It shifted : then it vanished . And , almost instantly , it reappeared . The path curved . We found ourselves in an oblong clearing , at the further end of which stood a large , grotesque structure  --  a rambling house in the French suburban style ; surrounded by a bevy of crumbling statues . Two of the windows were lit ; the brilliance poured through the night like a waterfall , hurling sprays of light on the ferns and lianas . There were silhouettes stirring behind he jalousies . And then an odd trickle of music ; the strains of a Beethoven symphony . Oudange crept up and peered through the window . A ladder of light sprang down his body . He nodded and beckoned . Alessandro strode up to the door and knocked discreetly , twice ; and then again , more briskly . Four men were sitting around a table , playing cards and drinkingport . Two Negroes and a yellow dog lay in a corner , half asleep . The whole room was steeped in decomposition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with termites . The carpets and curtains were bitten to shreds . Great equatorial shields and spears hung on the walls , mingling with a host of Victorian remnants  --  old engravings , embroidered proverbs , portraitsin human hair , vignettes of butterflies  --  all ground away and discolored , skeletal . At one end of the room hung an array of birds and reptiles ; they too were gray and powdery , the scales and feathers had crumbled away . On a bamboo table stood an alabaster Pan , an enormous sea shell , and a rococo clock ; all wrapped in a heavy cocoon of cobwebs . A phonograph stood near the window , hoarsely playing the Eroica . They poured us each a glass of wine ; it was inky and bitter . There was something clanstrophobiac in the heat . A sickening smell filled the room , like the breath of a dying beast . " So you 're paying Africa a visit ? " said one of them , a gaunt Mediterranean type with deep-set eyes and a violent nervous tick . " Leaving Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sinking . Two more years . Maybe three . And then . . . " He made a desperate grimace ; his teeth appeared  --  lime-colored , cavernous . He wore a spotted silk shirt , a filthy tic , and no trousers at all . He looked like a mad caricature of a decaying grandee . " Well , let it come . Let it come , I say . It will be a relief ; clean off the dying patient . The last great purge ! The final panacea ! " His face began to twitch ; the teeth emerged in a kind of snarl . Then he laughed ; a drab masochistic laugh . " Very well , " muttered another . " Have it your own way , PorTheOwl 79p79phyrides . I do n't dispute what you say , mind you . But you 're so brutally cynical , Porphyrides ! " This was an obsequious , ratlike man , with colorless hair slicked back over a pointed skull . He wore brown shorts and a blue-striped jersey . A Belgian , perhaps ; or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This other war was just a pirouette . Just a timid flirtation . But I 'm an optimist , Porphyrides ; not a damned cynic like you . " He said this all in a furry , flattering tone , as though he were playing a well-regulated role . " A new age awaits us : that much we 're agreed on , are n't we ? Soon the individual will be a museum piece , like an Egyptian scarab . We 'll have a race of identical , overfed babies , with colossal stomachs and testicles the size of a pea . Paradise , that 's what it will be . No dirt , no pain , no hunger , no lust . Just masses of soft music , soft food , soft everything . How does it sound to you ? .. . The music , please , Captain . " The symphony had come to a grinding halt . A tall , redheaded man rose to change the record . He walked with a limp ; one of the legs was heavily bandaged . And the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He limped back to the table and filled his glass . " Oh well , " he muttered , " why grumble ? We 're all caught in the same net . " He was an Englishman ; carrot-haired , with a bald spot on top , a red mustache , cold , vigilant , unbelievably haggard . His face looked whittled down to the point of disintegration . He was wearing a tattered pair of blue pajamas . " It 's not only Europe , " he said , with sudden ferocity . " It 's the world . Asia , Africa , America  --  they all kill witches , each in their way . Soon there 'll be no more witches . No more magic . No more fear . This time we 'll have the real , the everlasting Age of Reason . We 'll be safely tucked away among our nylons and pylons . . . . Nothing to worry us . Nothing to depress us . Everything clean and white as the Arctic Circle . Oh , you 're perfectly right , Pascal . Paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p8o  One of the Negroes had begun to snore . The dog was twitching in his sleep . Marius nodded his head ; his eyes flickered , and finally closed . Alessandro and Joshua were listening in silence . The fourth man in the quartet was staring at the table with a kind of leer . He wore nothing but a pair of filthy duck trousers . His damp white breasts hung down like a woman 's , his belly flowed over his belt . A thick gold bracelet was pinching his wrist , and his fingers glittered with rings  --  sapphires , emeralds , diamonds , dozens of them ; they kept dancing in and out of the lamplight . There hovered about him the fragrance of an old , deteriorated gigolo . He was smoking a thick cigar ; and he drew out his watch every two or three minutes , gazed at it with a deep sigh , and slid it back with an air of voluptuous appeasement . " The Age of Reason , " he said suddenly in his squeaking voice . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what we 'll have . You ought to know , Fortescue . Has n't the jungle delirium been gripping you ? Do n't you feel it ? Crouching behind you , opening its claws , spreading its fangs ? . . . " He gazed lasciviously at his watch , slipped it back , and sighed profoundly ; he seemed to swell , like a toad . The Greek drained his glass and placed his hands flat on the table . Ile stared viciously at the man with the watch . " Yes ! You 're in love with her , are n't you , Douche ? With that great black chancre-bitten whore ? Well , you 're welcome . You can have her . Ca n't he , 1 ' ortescuc ? She 's yours ! Take her ! Rip her to pieces ! " The man with the watch smiled contentedly . " Thank you , thank you , Porphyrides . You 're generous , as always . Yes , perhaps I 'm in love with her . I do n't deny it . But whore ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a calumny . She 's virgo intacta , I assure you . She 's never been penetrated . All that 's unexplored in the human soul , unanalyzed , unilluminated ; you 'll find it all in Africa ! You Russophilcs and Americanophiles ! You 've scarcely scratched the surface of the human conundrum ! You 've filled your music and art with little splinters of it . Beethoven . Rembrandt . Dostoev/ski . But the real thing ! You have n't touched it . That last plunge into the wilderness , that final leap into the unknowable  --  you 've never dared it ! " He grew thoughtful ; he caressed his watch . " No , no , " he murmured . " We 've all been wasting our lives . You up in the north , you 've never dared to fulfill your destinies . You understand ? Love , comfort , culture , society  --  they all protect you like a misty gauze , keeping out the blinding light , the terrible insects , the great reality . Africa ! That 's where the soul really bursts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a secret pattern exposed to a chemical . Everything flickers with life and love . Everything joins in the melodrama ! " Porphyrides stared at the ceiling and suddenly spread his arms , as though crucified . " Africa ! Africa ! Good God ! It 's the land of nausea , that 's what it is . This vile accretion of humanity , with its madness and misery , its stench and delirium , its unutterable boredom ! Yes ! You and your glorious melodrama ! You and your love , Fouche " " Ah , " said Fouche very gently , smiling cunningly at his watch . " Perhaps you forget . Our kind of love is n't yours , Porphyrides . " The symphony faded into a blur of discords . The English captainlimped across the room to shut it off . The Negroes were snoring heavily . Marius was fast asleep . Porphyrides got up quietly and left the room . Pascal followed him . Fouche kept running his finger along the edge of the table . And now the kerosene lamp began to flicker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned casually to Captain Fortescue ; he was lighting his pipe . " You have n't run across , by any chance , a man named Speght ? " I murmured . " Leonard Speght ? " " Speght ? Wait a moment . Speght . " He frowned ; but he seemed to smile inwardly . " Yes , yes . I know the man . Had a drink with him once . Down in Fort Lamy . Weird fellow . Charming manners ,  | good looks , and all that . But a crook at heart . A real blackguard ! With a wild look in his eyes ; all the girls were madly in love with him . Clever . Lots of imagination . But wrong ; way wrong . Rotting away inside , he was . One could see it in his mouth . And his hands , of course . I judge a man by his hands , myself . " I scratched my chin absent-mindedly . " What ever happened to him , do you suppose ? " " Happened to him ? Lord knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in him . " " Is he still down in Fort Lamy ? " " God , no ! " exclaimed Portescue . " Ile was there just a day or two . On his way to Mount Nagala , the fool . Looking for something or other . Gold . Diamonds . Rubies . Or just plain ivory . ... " " How far , " I said discreetly , " is it to Mount Nagala ? Do you know ? " Portescue raised his brows . " You 're not dreaming of Nagala ? " " Well , not really , " I said mistily . " I was curious . Merely curi-ous . " " You 'll never reach Nagala , " said the captain blandly . " No ? Why not ? " " No one , " said the captain , with a cryptic air , " ever does . " I looked at him closely . " Tell me , " I said with exasperation ; " what is this nonsense ? About Nagala ? " His eyes grew rather quizzical . " Nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rose . " Is there any nonsense about Nagala ? " I lay on my cot , simultaneously shivering and sweating . Joshua had given me my ration of quinine , but I felt odd ; distinctly feverish . The lamp beside the cot dropped a yellow rectangle through the window , brightening a cascade of foliage . An owl swungp83noiselessly across the ray , veered blindly , and loped into the blackness . There was a swift rustle : then a shrill , infinitesimal cry . I turned down the wick . The light thinned out and died . The scent of jasmine hung unpleasantly on the dead black air . I closed my eyes and tried to sleep . A sense of cool , accelerating motion came over me ; as though the cot , the room , the entire house were traveling through the night at an incredible speed . And then everything seemed to turn ; the wheels grew vaster , dissolved into cycles ; and these expanded into torrential whirlpools . And then abruptly I was aware , for no clear reason , of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it , like a breath of wind . I opened my eyes and turned over in my bed , very slowly . Nothing ever , in this dark abdominal region of the world , seemed really incongruous . And so this apparition did n't really surprise me . It stood in the doorway , pale and vaporous . I saw the face ; but somehow it gave the impression of not being a face at all , of being rather a shaded embryo , a half-human tabula rasa on which only an expression of fetal groping had begun to form ; of a mute and anguished questioning when confronted with the fury of the world . Cool , soft as a cat , it slipped across the room . It paused beside the window with an air of deep absorption . It was a man ; a white man ; that much was evident at any rate . Then he turned . The watery glint of the night passed over his face . It was like a blow in the chest . The familiar features had changed , had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose cast a long pale shadow , like a beak . His body , leaning silently out of the window , seemed covered with wounds . " Joshua ! " I whispered . But he did n't seem to hear . He turned , slid through the room and out through the door . And a moment later , as ' I listened to the rustling of the leaves , I was n't sure after all that it had been Joshua . I was n't sure that it had been anyone . Everything  --  sight , sound , human existence itself  --  seemed wildly arbitrary ; an elaborate metaphor . Only the night itself seemed inescapable , inexorable.  |p84Now  the River took on a fierce golden hue . Herons went floating through the mirror-smooth inlets . Far away we heard the tom-toms ; and below the sound of drums the deep , oceanic rumble of the goudougoudon . The African spring had arrived . It filled the air like a kind of lunacy . Nature had turned into a gigantic brothel . Wherever we looked  --  along the shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water  --  bird , insect and reptile were galvanized into coition . The yellow parakeets spun in and out of the vines , two by two ; the dragonflies and locusts flashed by , rigidly coupled . Far away there was a deep libidinous moan ; the hippopotamus . Even the trees seemed to swell , to send forth amorous little tentacles . Everything was plunged in a frenzy of proliferation . And yet somehow it was all strangely desolate : procreation itself was tinged with anarchy , disintegration . The Mirabelle was an asthmatic little steamer , withered and battered , thick with layers of decay . The decks sizzled with flies , the cabins rustled with vermin , the whole vessel reeked with the scent of innumerable tiny corpses . The shutters creaked continuallywhile a feverish whine rose from below , and now and again a great convulsion passed through the ship , a peristaltic shudder of nausea . Slowly she plowed up the River , cancerous , moribund.  |p85She  seemed ready to burst out of sheer ennui . But the River was like an anesthetic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , vomiting masses of yellow smoke , and giving vent every so often to an electrifying scream . Then the sun crept higher with a slow , menacing intensity . The air grew still . The water took on a deep crimson hue as it bored its way through a land of mutilation . Infinite tributaries coiled through the mangrove swamps , and in the inlets lay the crocodiles , motionless as logs , opening a vicious eye as we passed . Now the sun reached its peak . It hung over the land like a candelabra , not a single great light but thousands of little bulbs , each sending out a poisonous tongue of flame . Every living creature had fled into shadow . Everything was silent and absolutely motionless . When I glanced over the water I felt the light stab my eyes like a splinter of glass . Everything looked brittle and angular , as in a cubist painting : everything was being split , crystallized , fissionized . No curves were left ; no hues , no gradations . Deep below us , deep under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half hiss , half gurgle : death by strangulation . Whose death ? My own , possibly ? The source of life was being crushed . Nothing seemed worth doing . Darkness , that 's all I wanted . The very light was like a ceaseless , diabolically ingenious instrument of torture . I was sitting beside Joshua under a raffia awning . Ndjoluva came strolling disconsolately down the deck , with a guilty look in his great neolithic eyes . He was in pain , he explained . " I 've been a bad man , " he murmured . " Well , what have you been up to , Ndjoluva ? " He hung his head . " I made love , " he said gloomily , " to the wicked Crocodile Spirit . " " Yes ? Where is the pain ? " said Joshua . " Here , Jassa . Look . Do you see ? It 's the vengeance of the Crocodile Spirit . " He pressed his pink fingernails against the black woolly hair.  | It was an obvious case of gonorrhea . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days . From whom did he get it ? From the CrocodileSpirit , he replied , with dignity . Had he made love to anyone in Ndessa ? Or Banzi'bangi ? He looked suspicious ; certainly , he said . Six girls in Banzi'bangi . Three more in Ndessa . Joshua gave him some sulfa tablets . Ndjoluva held them reverentlyin his palm and gazed at them with a repentant smile . " With these , " he said triumphantly , " I will kill the Crocodile Spirit . And the badness will flow out of me . Kabisa ! I will be a good man , bwana ! " We came to a pale , secluded stretch of the shore . Long sand banks , gleaming with millions of shells , spread on and on through the glossy shallows . A flock of geese had come to rest on the sand . Suddenly they rose , clumsy and ponderous , and swung in toward the swamplands , slowly gaining height and an exquisite , leisurely precision . The water grew ruffled under the breeze of their wings . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring filled the horizon . The whole sky was filled with wings . A palpitating cloud of birds spread over the shore : pale pink , pale mauve , a luminous rose , a snowy white . They swept in a wild flurry over the smooth green bank while the geese moved steadily southward , regimental , serene . A terrible screeching and screaming filled the air . The flamingos kept rising and gradually scattered , feverishly dividing into flocks : the white ones heading northward , the pink and the purple westward ; higher and higher , till their clamor finally died away , moving toward God knows what inaccessible plateaus . On and on we sailed . Deeper and deeper into silence . The River slowly broadened and the flood grew sleek as molasses . It licked the beaches without a ripple . Tufted seeds like flakes of snow were gliding about on the surface . The impenetrable banks were teem/ing with huge , epiphytic orchids ; the coves were filled with the glorious white and blue of Nymphaea stellata . We passed a tiny fishing village perched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirogue . There were no clouds , nothing except a haze far upstream which blurred the monochrome treetops and water . Time lay annihilated . And distance as well . The miles went trickling past without moving . Everything seemed asleep yet breathlessly on the alert ; ready to leap into a carnivorous frenzy . " Here , " said Oudange , pointing toward the mango trees , " live the cannibals , bwana . " And he told me all about them . Mou-m'sahali they were called ; or Panther Men . They were no longer dangerous of course . In fact , they lived in a state of abject misery and timidity . But they still , by force of tradition , painted their faces into bloodthirsty masks and filed their teeth into little points . Oudange had known a young mou-m'sahali as a boy ; he knew their eccentric ways and habits . What had driven them to slaughter , he explained , was never hunger , or greed , or mere barbarity . It was simply bad luck : the fact that their bush spirit happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe , the craving was rooted in inherited fear and totemism . It was , like all African rituals , an act of obedienceto the Ancestral Beast . And this was what happened . A young native was selected by an intricate secret rite . He then was brought an ancient panther skin , claws of iron , and a long sharp knife . A few nights before the murder he went out and carefully planted the footprints of a panther near the victim 's village . Then , on the chosen night , a group of experienced mou-m'sahali covered their bodies with blue paint , in the usual panther pattern , then slipped through the jungle toward the victim 's hut , beat him silently over the head , and carried him off while the others slept . The victim  --   | usually a boy in his teens , not too lean , was brought to a dark grove and laid on his stomach . The head was raised , exposing his throat . The killer crouched on all fours , possessed by the Panther Spirit . The chieftain gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men chanted in unison till the blood ceased to flow . Each man was given a tiny cupful of blood . Then the body was cooked in fat , and presently the banquet began . The choice bits  --  ears , tongue , kidneys , et cetera  --  were saved for the killer , who growled and snarled in the traditional manner . After the feast the bones and remnants were ground to bits and cautiously buried . " But they were not a cheerful people , the mou-m'sahali , " said Oudange , shaking his head . " They were nervous . They were worried . The meat of man did n't quite agree with them .... " We stopped at Doughaya . Three Negroes dove from a long wooden pier to fasten the ropes . A horde of vendors was scrambling and bickering about the harbor . Lanky half-breeds sidled up to sell us cigarettes , silk , chocolate , jewels , and every conceivable subtlety of amour . They clung to us , fondling our clothes , our shoes , our portfolios . We wandered up toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hints of old migrations and intermingled tribes . Porphyry-skinnedmen and women were gliding through the tamarinds ; figures draped in white wandered slowly among the palms . We entered the old city , passing through great shattered walls which stank with centuries of offal . Ruined citadels and mansions were rotting among the brushwood : victims of forgotten warring dynasties . In the bazaar men in feathers , men in hides , men in capes and burnooses , men in shirts , in skirts , in khaki trunks , in nothing at all , squeezed their way through heaps of salt and kola nuts and millet . There were the hawkers , wearing long scarlet gloves , and the sellers of oxen , draped in yellow beads . There were smiling ,  |p89cocoa-breasted  girls offering us gourds of milk and lemon juice . Children came wandering up from the River with colossal fish , shaped like flounder , balanced lightly on their heads . Here Europe and Asia and Africa had coalesced ; white , yellow , brown and black ; the noble Jew and the bleak Mohammedan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries as well  --  from the prehistoric to the atomic . Plastic bowls and nylon brushes lay for sale among a host of amulets , chips of flint , leopard 's teeth . A huge Negro passed on horseback : he looked like a medievalknight in armor , with a great plumed helmet , mounted on a brilliantly caparisoned palfrey . We were stopped in the middle of the bazaar by a plump little official in a tattered uniform , a greasy cap and broken spectacles . He took Alessandro by the arm and hissed : " Your papers , please , monsieur . " We showed him a sheaf of documents . He glanced at them capriciously . " No others , monsieur ? " We said no : no others . He paused , ran his tongue over his red mustache , and sighed . " These are insufficient , monsieur . " Marius seized the fellow savagely by the arm . " Here are the passports . Here are the visas . Here are the hunting licenses , " he bellowed . " Insufficient ? Yes ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked deeply pained . " Insufficient for Doughaya , monsieur , " he pleaded . " For Doughaya , " he paused impressively , " you need Special Permits . " I looked at him carefully ; I was beginning to understand . I waved him to one side . " Special Permits ? " I whispered . " Yes , " he nodded discreetly , brightening up ; " Special Permits , monsieur . Precisely . " I slipped two thousand-franc notes into his pocket . " Be so kind as to arrange them , please , " I said , with a slight leer.  |p90He  gazed at the sky with a poetical air . " Precisely , monsieur , " he murmured tenderly . It was in Doughaya that Maburu left us . This was where her sisters lived ; this was where she was going to stay , marry , and have children . Ndjoluva led her quietly through the bazaar . She looked back , without expression , and slowly raised her left hand . Then she vanished among the dusty stalls . That night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirabelle for the last time . The porters were creeping along the pier , carrying sacks of supplies on board : pineapples , bananas , sugar and salt . A smell of cinnamon filled the air . A slender shape in a white shawl emerged from the aisle of palmettos that lined the harbor . She crept up to me shyly ; her eyes were shining like embers . She touched my arm . " Sambula ! " she said in a great flaming whisper . Ten she took my hand and pressed it to her forehead . I drew her close ; her thin long body was laden with a desperate tenderness  --  it was like a wineglass filled with wine , or a tree full of flowers  --  trembling with a hidden , incommunicable brightness . " Good-by , Maburu , " I said . " You 'll remember me ? " she whispered . I nodded solemnly . " Always , Maburu . " " Will you ever come back ? By and by ? " Perhaps , I said ; perhaps . Nothing is ever sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly . " You will never come back . You will never touch me again . I will never see you again . " She drew away and crept back among the trees without turning her head . But later , beside the gangplank , as I glanced toward the shore , I saw two large eyes glowing among the shadows , like the eyes of a cat . " Good-by , Maburu , " I called , with a sudden pang of horror . But there was no answer ; nothing but a rustling among the leaves.  |p91The  Mantis The ship moved on through the shiftless waters . We had entered the Lake and were heading for Lambori . Everything was hushed . The distant shore looked dead and obsolete , plunged in another , still more desolate era . A corpselike peace hovered among the rushes . " Look , " said Balibobotee , breaking the stillness . A shining mass lay floating in the water beside us ; it looked like a great aluminum sack . Then it turned very slowly in the yellow roll of the wake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a dead hippopotamus , swollen to the point of explosion . The scent of putrefaction crept over the boat , shimmering faintly , like an ugly halo . " You are sad today , " said Balibobotee brightly , placing his hand on his hip . In his other hand he held a ripe banana . " Sad ? No , Balibobotee . " " You look sad , Sambula . " I stared indifferently at the waters . Balibobotee could be rather tiresome . " You always look sad , Sambula . You think you are happy , but you really are sad . " " Why should I be sad ? "  | His eyes twinkled . " Who knows ? " he murmured coyly . " I can only guess . I ca n't be sure . Perhaps your bush spirit is an owl , or a green ibis ; this , of course , would explain your sadness .... " Fishermen were drifting by through the evening . Their hard emaciated bodies hung from the canoes : they moved through the windless air like departing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Now two of them rose cautiously and spread their nets , and two others flung themselves into the shallows , scrambling through the water to beat up the fish . Slowly the fishermen gathered in the nets : there was nothing but a small blue catfish . Balibobotee cast the banana skin into the lake and clung wearily to the railing . His oily obesity shone in the crimson light : he looked like a great sea lion . " I 'm from the Ivory Coast , you know , " he stated demurely . " Not from Equatorial Africa . We from the Ivory Coast look down just a bit on the Equatorians ; they smell odd , for one thing . And they 're lazy . And untidy . We from the Ivory Coast are extremely neat and bicn soignes . " He pursed his lips primly . " Do n't you think , " he added softly , peering from the corner of his eye , " that nay French has a certain elegance ? " " Distinctly , " I said . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact . A French gentleman picked me up in Grand Bassam one day , when I was just a slender boy , and took me to Paris . I danced in Le Chat Oui Rif , dressed in a leopard skin . Then I beat a drum in Le Zanzibar , dressed in a large pink turban . Then I served coffee at La Belle Sauvage , dressed in a brocade jacket . It was all very chic , you understand . Very exclusive . One day I grew terribly homesick and jumped on a boat for Africa . But it landed in the Cameroons instead of Grand l3assam . And here I still am , among these slovenly Equatorians . Life , I 'm afraid , is very whimsical . " The sun touched the water . Signs of life were appearing . Insects were skimming over the blazing surface  --  swarms of wasps andp93water beetles , copulating dragonflies . They stayed absolutely motionless as we spluttered past , rising and falling in the weary swell . Two birds went diving at a school of minnows . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white and blue kingfishers swung over the ripples . Farther off the purple jacana birds ran lightly over the lily pads , and beyond stretched the endless , vague savannahs of central Africa . A small , eccentric bird lit on the railing six feet away . It was gazing at a minute twig which had fallen on the deck . It cocked its head judiciously . The twig seemed to stir : then it rose a little . I could see two gray protuberant eyes . It folded its legs . It seemed , not precisely to pray ; rather to mourn . The bird opened its beak , blinked its eyes , shook its feathers . It was about the size of a magpie . Two brilliant tufts of magenta shot from the tips of the wings , and it bore a high , lily-shaped headdress of emerald green . It looked like a ballerina . It shot down , dipped its rosy beak in the Lake , and returned to the railing . Now the mantis reared and grew stiff with despair , gazing at the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paws and did a withered salaam . Then it waited , enthralled . The bird cocked its head and looked at me with a triumphant glitter . Then it dove , snatched the insect , and swung low over the darkening water . There 's no twilight in Africa . Night falls like a curtain the moment the sun has set . We could see the old fishermen wading in the shallows , placing their fire pots along the shore ; their narrow silhouettes grew sharp as they leaned to beat the water and drew their hexagonal nets toward the land . Marius drained his wineglass . " Look here , Sambula , " he said suddenly , placing his great red hands flat on the table . " Let 's have the truth . Why in God 's name did you come to Africa ? " I felt disconcerted , a bit . " You know why , " I said carefully . " To find a man . To solve a mystery . "  | Marius shrugged his shoulders . " Idiot ! Africa 's no place to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , and you , Alessandro ? " Alessandro cast a strange , suffering , penetrating look at Marius , and looked away again . " To find a style , " he said , without expression . " To bring my talent back to life . " Marius turned to Joshua with a heavy contemptuous leer . " And you ? Be honest , Monsieur 1'Americain . You look stranger here than any of us . Why did you come ? Let 's have it . " Joshua held his wineglass in the light ; it cast a feathery glow over his bulging glasses . " To find insects , " he said in a kind of whimper . " That 's all . Nothing more . " Marius laughed . I-Ic hurled his sun helmet to the floor . " Here we are . A jolly quartet , I must say ! Sambula comes to find his mysteriousfriend . Alessandro conks to find his withered talent . Little Joshua comes to find his pretty butterflies . I come to find my Goddamnedplatinum . Yes ! Incredible , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright Algerian wine shone like amber , pure , elusive , between his thick wet fingers . " Listen , my friends . Now you 'll have the truth . We 've all been lying . Cheating . Masquerading . We 've all been hiding a shameful secret ! What is it we 're really after ? Let 's be honest . One wants peace . Another wants love . A third wants faith . A fourth wants power . It 's all very simple . And rather absurd . How abort- it , Sandro ? " Alessandro drew his glass through a little pool of wine . His eyes remained lowered ; his frail lips were parted tensely . " Wait , Marius . Are you sure ? Are we really looking for something ? Or are we running away from something ? Do n't ask why we 've come to Africa . Ask why we 've fled from Europe ! " Something strange was happening to Alessandro . He looked alarmingly weak ; weak not only in body but nervously attenuated , lacerated . There was a light infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to spread . Deep shadows clung to his eyes . He shivered now and again.  |p95A  long canoe drifted alongside the Mirabelle , lit by two dying torches . The fishermen lay sprawled among the nets , sunk in slumber . Some long pale fish were twitching nervously in a basket . They passed and faded away in the night . " Yes ! " snarled Marius , hurling his fist in the air . " I can tell you why I ran from Europe ! Because it smells like a charnel house . Becauseit 's crawling with maggots . It 's dead , it 's dead ! Look around . What do you see ? The New Dark Ages have begun , I tell you ! With cinemas instead of temples , and laboratories instead of lamaseries . Do n't you feel it ? That awful bleakness , the negation and sterility ? Man believes in nothing , not even his own appetites ! Only his body is left  --  a shivering mass of flesh groping wildly among the Frigidaires in search of an ideal . Yes ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Destroyers of Man . All those dazzling inventions which bring us light and music , coolness and warmth , bliss and tears , love and hate  --  they 're the great new Vandals , the blond barbarians from the north . But what they 're after this time is n't the gold and marble , it 's the soul itself . Oh yes , they 've brought freedom ! Freedom to rot away in comfort ! " Another canoe slid past , slightly larger than the others : a fortyfootdugout , with a roof of leaves in the middle . Four men were paddling lazily at each end while the steersman sang a solo . The glow from the Mirabelle shone on their lean , smiling faces . " Yes , everything , " said Alessandro quietly , drawing his fingers over his forehead , " everything 's being split . The human soul as well as the atom . It flickers and rattles , like ships of glass in a kaleidoscope . There 's an illusion of symmetry , of perfection as we gaze . Then it shifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears . And then again and still again . Each with its own brief dazzle , its air of final elucidation . There it is . Then it 's gone . Nothing lasts . We 've turned into schizophrenics ! " He looked out over the Lake . A mist had risen from the water . Down the deck lay the shapes of the slumbering porters , Momboola with his arm around Ramazana 's belly , Bambo rolled in a ball , Oudange crouched like a sphinx , his bracelets gleaming faintly . " And yet , " said Alessandro in a high-pitched voice , " what in God 's name can we do ? Keep fighting all our lives to remain individuals ? And turn into exiles and eccentrics and hermits ? Or else submit . Subside . Slip into the arms of the multitudes . Live , pray , hope , sleep , kiss , vomit with the multitude . It 's not easy ; not easy . " He looked wearily at the stars . " Man has lost something precious . Something it took him centuries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image is crumbling . He must build it up again . Quickly . Passionately . Or perish . " The Mirabelle went gasping and staggering through the night . Now the stars were blazing  --  vibrant and fiery as I 'd never seen them . The lines of the shore and the fishermen 's torches had faded away . The sleepers were stirring . Bambo rolled on his back . Oudange 's apelike head fell on his shoulder . And Momboola cried in his sleep ; he was twitching with excitement . Everyone was asleep . It was long after midnight . I lay sweating and stifling under my mosquito net . I saw the stars filtering through the cabin shutters , one by one , like drops through a sieve . And then the sieve widened . The door slowly opened . A slender silhouettewas crouching motionless in the crevice : the light fell faintly on his earrings . Something shone in his hand . A splinter of steel caught the starlight . My body stiffened ; the epidermis , swifter than the mind , was tingling with detestation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward ; an arm reached out cautiously ; the knife hung in the darkness . And then nothing more . There was a meditative pause . Almost , I thought , a kind of sorrowful perplexity . I could hear his heavy breathing as I waited , ready to spring.  |p97But  nothing happened . The shape recoiled . For an instant I saw the profile . Then slowly , with a deep thoughtful sigh , he withdrew . Ten minutes passed . Perhaps twenty . I was just beginning to doze off again . There was a flurry outside the cabin , and then a beating on the door . It was Bambo . " Come , come , " he whispered , seizing Joshua by the arm . " A wicked thing has happened , Jassa . .. " We followed him down the deck . Oudange was crouching beside the railing with Momboola in his arms . A faint glow rose from the engine room : blood was trickling from Momboola 's shoulder , in which a long blue knife lay shining . Momboola 's eyes were half closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one said a word . Joshua hurried to fetch his kit , then knelt beside the wounded man and drew out the knife  --  it was Ramazana 's . Oudange raised his head and looked patiently at the stars . " Water madness , bwana .... " We found Ramazana coiled in the lifeboat , limp with despair . He crawled out and flung himself on his knees , clutching Alessandro'slegs . " He must go , " said Oudange in a deep strange voice . " We must leave him in Lambori . " " Do n't leave me , do n't leave me , " sang Ramazana in his quaveringvoice . " Yes , " whispered Oudange , placing his hand on the half-breed 's head . " He must go . He must go . " Ramazana 's long body was dripping like a swimmer 's . It had turned into a deep , dead elephant gray . He kept kissing Alessandro'sknees , feet , ankles and hands , muttering in a thin , griefstrickentone . " No , no ! It was Momboola , bwana ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized me .... " " He must go , " said Oudange gravely . " He must go at Lambori , or the water madness will spread . " And he led , ever so gently , the shuddering wild-eyed boy down below.  |p98Light  filled the world . Everything was ablaze . A cataract of light sprang from the sky , poured through the mangroves , filtered across the swamps , spread through the palmettos , flashed in the wings of a locust , rose from the glittering sand and sank its fangs into the soft red mud . It hovered among the endless festoons of moss . It lit on the wings of the diving kingfisher , danced on the rippled inlets and finally died among the myriads of rushes . Light , nothing but light . No energy survived but that of light . Everything lay shattered , atomized by light . The streaks of sand hung like a vapor , striped by feathery stretches of papyrus , and beyond by a sauntering herd of buffaloes . The water blazed like a glass reflecting the sun . My eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I he intolerable cascade of light fell straight from above , probing every crevice and withering the last flakes of shadow . I grew sick with a yearning for darkness and concealment . Light shot through the distance in millions of arrows ; it drained the land of all energy , color , shape , movement ; it killed all possibilityof thought or desire . And then it changed unexpectedly . It grew rich and oblique . Cool undertones , exquisite variations appeared . Subtleties of hue emerged from the blaze and took on a glowing purity . Leaves andp99flowers hung suspended like small miracles in their perfection . Crocodiles came shuffling out of the water , sparkling like ornamentalbronze , and turtles lifted their gilded heads through the foam . Then the light grew still deeper . It became a fragrance in the hollows ; it became a strand of music in the trembling of the cattails . It brought back the leap of life which it had crushed and annihilated . It drew , out of the widening caves of shadow , its web of living things like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crocodiles swam past . They floated along just under the surface , their scales drawing a train of shallow ripples as they passed . Only their eyes protruded , like two heavyliddedmarbles , leering murderously right and left . Around the bend a small antelope emerged from the thicket , stood on the shore for a moment and gazed at us dreamily , and then , in a slow fragile gesture , bowed down to drink . As she bent her head , a leathery arrow leapt vertically from the water , jaws gaping , and seized the delicate drinker by the neck ; all in less than a second . And then from all sides came a ravenous foaming and churning , as dozens of other crocodiles rushed in to snatch at the victim . Then they all sank down to the river bed with their booty , the waters heaved uneasily , petals of red swam to the surface . I lost all sense of space or time , of concrete incident or human identity . The men around me began to merge into a dark , indistinguishablemass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another like beads on a chain , dimly , chimerically . There was indeed a kind of pattern ; but it was a pattern like the stripes on a tiger 's back  --  brilliant , brutal , imponderable , to be explainedonly by the whim of some vast power beyond the shadows . I no longer felt myself as a part of the surrounding world . My past and future faded into an anachronism . I was bored . Im- measurably , transcendentally bored . Within me lurked nothing but a grinding core of weariness , dragged through interminable vistas of yellow leaves and yellow water . I sank into a haze ; the coils of water rolled by ; the birds dipped and screamed ; the engine kept grumbling . Everything fell into a deadly , magical symmetry . Ripples appeared at last . An infinitesimal breeze had arisen . A flock of ruby-red birds followed the boat , cawing insanely ; and the sky deepened into a magniloquent blue . The Mirabelle fell into an insidious rocking rhythm . Two of the Negroes leaned quietly over the railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sagittaria ; and innumerable straw villages with ramshacklewooden piers . Here and there a black swimmer waved to us from the golden sands . And finally we could see the pink roofs of Lambori , shining among the palms at the peak of the Lake . Alessandro was sitting in the shade , doing a pencil sketch of the little half-breed , Ramazana , who was to leave us in Lambori . The boy was sulking ; his eyes were lowered . Tears were hanging from his long treacherous eyelashes . Alessandro had developed an odd technique , like that of an engraving : countless serpentine strokes , simmering and intense , which reduced the human body to a tortured labyrinth . There was no trace of the African sensuality or torpor ; his Negroes looked as though their skin had been peeled , exposing a hypersensitive tangle of nerves and tendons . " Look here , " lie said suddenly . " You 're still serious about Nagala ? " I smiled grimly . " Of course I 'm still serious about Nagala . " " Give up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Alessandro turned and glared at me : there was something bitter and challenging in his eyes . " Tell me the truth . What is it you want ? " I glanced uneasily toward the shore . " I 'm not sure . I 'll never be sure . "  | " You 'll never find Speght , " said Alessandro . " Never . You know it . " " Perhaps not , " I said dreamily . " Sometimes I think I 'd rather not . " " It 's your pride , " said Alessandro . " Either that or caprice . Or still worse , a misguided bravado . Or worst of all , a silly romanticism . Forgive me , Sambula . But be reasonable . Be sane . " " And you ? " I said quietly . " Are you still serious about Nagala ? " He shot a piercing look at me . " With me it 's different , by God ! With me , " he said , with quiet intensity , " it 's a matter of survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lambori is an unspeakably desolate spot , a quagmire seething with millions of anopheles mosquitoes and littered with scraps of obsolete machinery  --  rusting tracks and wheels and strips of corrugatediron : the crumbling remnants of an alien cupidity finally devoured by its own victim . Once Lambori was a place of legend , touched with migratory magic ; the confluence of ancient caravan routes ranging from the Sudan all the way to Timbuktu and Dakar . But the caravans began to dwindle ; and soon were replaced by the ruthless , predatory energy from the north . Then that too began to fade ; finally it expired . And now Lambori is nothing but a flyriddencadaver , sinking deeper and deeper into the yellow swamps . We were guests for the night of the local agent of the Export Company ; the last of a dying dynasty , a pudgy scoundrel named D'Estaing . We sat on his veranda after dinner and watched the fishing boats down on the Lake . " Look around ! " he said contemptuously , fanning his damp white head with a palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incurable sloth . These people are all fast asleep , you know . And it 's not only the tsetse that 's done it . They 've been asleep all their lives . They 're born in a somnambulistic daze . They know nothing , they think102nothing , they achieve nothing , they feel nothing  --  nothing but an imbecilic terror . They are n't really individuals . They 're figures in a nightmare . Oh , please do n't think that I dislike them ! I 'm  --  actually quite fond of them . But they 're simply not altogether human , that 's all ! " A pock-marked boy in a white jacket brought out the coffee . He leaned over and poured it cautiously into large green cups ; his hands were trembling . We could hear the mosquitoes whining beyond the screen , and far below us the frogs began to bellow . " They need discipline of course , " murmured D'Estaing , almost tenderly . He leaned closer . A sickly smell issued from his wet silk shirt . " I 've learned , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fines . Even blows , now and then .... " " Has any other way been tried ? " I inquired discreetly . He peered at me sharply . " One ca n't afford to run risks , " he snapped . " There are nasty undercurrents in this part of the world , you must realize . Explosive situations . Seditious possibilities . You ca n't handle these illiterates with a half-baked idealism . " " Have you tried , " I said , " to teach them ? " " Teach them ! " he squealed . " You ca n't afford to teach them ! Teach them , my boy , and they grow hopelessly insubordinate . No , there 's no solution . None except force ; brute authority ! " The monkeys were beginning to cry in the thicket  --  a dry , bitter , disputatious clamor . A heavy bird went loping through the shrubs ; some sort of owl . Enormous white moths , as large as a hand , were clinging to the veranda screen . Their wings were patterned like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear boy , " D'Estaing pleaded silkily . " There will always be an abyss between Africa and the rest of the world . Do what you wish , nothing will change them . The final barrier will always remain . It must remain ! If it goes , let me tell you , we 'll all be massacred overnight . And our culture along with it . Racine , Debussy , Cezanne  --  pfft ! " He drew hisp103finger across the jugular . " And that will be the end of Western civilization . Take my word for it . Oh yes , words like liberty , equality , fraternity , ' are all very cozy in a place like France . But here in the jungle . . . No , no , my dear . It wo n't do . I know . I 've been here thirty-three years and I know ! " It was after midnight . The lights of Lambori had died ; the fishing pots were being extinguished . But the wilderness was awake  --  calling , crying , whimpering , chirping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came hurling themselves against the screen , more and more of them ; literally thousands ; until the screen was covered with their white , vibrating bodies . The heat and the insects in my bedroom were intolerable . Not a breath of wind , only the grinding turmoil of the jungle . I got up and wandered down the hall toward the veranda . A light shone at the end of the hall , trickling through a bamboo curtain . I paused for a moment and looked in ; I felt restless ; I wanted to talk . It was a small disheveled room  --  D'Estaing 's bedroom apparently . D'Estaing himself was standing with his back to the curtain , his unclad body quivering grotesquely as he raised and lowered his soft white arms . On the floor lay a powerfully built young Negro , feet and hands bound with ropes , twisting soundlessly under the stroke of the whip . " This will teach you ! " D'Estaing whimpered , panting heavily . " This will teach you , you mongrel ! I could have you sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallows ! " His voice grew lachrymose ; he was hideously drunk . IIe flicked the whip to and fro . " You ought to thank me , you lizard ! Trying to run away , were you ? Trying to report me at Doughaya ? Do you know what they 'd do to you at Doughaya ? They 'd laugh in your filthy face ! Then they 'd throw you out to the crocodiles . Yes , my boy , you 're lucky I 'm a softhearted old devil ! " He raised his arm . The black boy 's face was contorted with terror ; his eyes rolled wildly , his jaws shook convulsively . " Yes ! " squealed D'Estaing . " Now you know who 's your master ! " He whined with the effort ; the whip shot through the air and lit on the Negro 's upturned face . Blood began trickling over his eyes and lips . Now D'Estaing , quite beside himself , stepped forward and bent down . He touched the Negro 's streaming cheeks fastidiously ; he drew his short white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he spat in the boy 's face . " Let this be a lesson , " he murmured in a fatherly tone . He rose , stood off , and kicked him viciously in the groin . The boy doubled up ; he began to moan  --  a low and hopeless , almost ritualisticsound . His eyes were clotted with blood ; his lips were huge and purple . D'Estaing suddenly crumpled ; he slid to the floor . He clung to the Negro like a great white leech . " You wo n't do it again , will you ? You 're sure ? Never again ? " His voice faded into an atrocious little purr . I stumbled into the night and lay down breathlessly under the stars.  |p105We  left the shores of the Lake ; we passed Maroua and GaneBouroaand skirted the edge of the Lomagoudou , which drew its fiery waters over a waste of yellow mud . Then we entered the brush . We passed long grassy dunes and small tropical basins , all veined with salt marshes and filled with brittle vegetation  --  tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pink ibises fluttered away ; blue-buttocked apes shot through the foliage . We passed a crumbling fortress with castellations of blood-red clay . Two horsemen stood below in the bird-spattered shade , willowy men with painted faces and necklaces of ivory . Momboola , proud of the big bandage on his back , waved to them and cried , " Ah-whala ! Ah-whala ! " and they waved back merrily , with white , conspiratorial smiles . We shot seven guinea fowl in the bottom of the valley . Baliboboteebroiled them for lunch , stuffed with long black raisins . We ate in the shade of a flowering acacia and watched the clouds drift over the hills . And for the first time in Africa I felt something close to harmony . Something almost like music ; a deep and subtle self- abandonment . The monstrous loveliness of the land was beginning to grip me . Momboola squatted at my feet . A gnat had flown into his eye . " Please , Sambula , " he grunted , stretching the skin apart . I raised the lid and flicked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye was watery and swollen . " Does it hurt ? " I said . He grinned contemptuously . " Hurt ? Nothing hurts me ! I 'm a brave man , Sambula ! " And he stared at me with sudden curiosity . " You are lonely , Sambula . I see a lonely little man deep in your eyes . . . . You 've never married ? " " Never quite , Momboola . " " No children even ? " " Well , I doubt it . " " No brothers ? No sisters ? " None , I confessed . Momboola sighed with compassion . " Then you 've always been lonely ? No , no , Sambula . It 's bad for you . Stay in Africa . I 'll find you a wife . And your seed is healthy . I can see it . You 'll have plenty of children ! " I smiled and shook my head . " I 'd make a bad , bad husband , I 'm afraid ! . . . No . I can wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystified . He rose and stared at the clouds . Then lie belched , rather thoughtfully , and wandered off . He seemed faintly offended . Shepherds appeared on the hillside with straggling herds of sheep . They looked timeless , Homeric through the hazy distance . But when they came closer the impression changed ; they looked for all the world like a group of courtesans . Their gait was contemptuous , ornate ; their glance was cunning and meretricious . They passed with a flickering of eyelashes and a tinkling of bracelets . Now the afternoon air grew extraordinarily clear and tranquil.  |p107Far  to the east we could see , for the first time and the last , the misty peaks of Mount Maura and Mount Koonala . Bambo came and placed his tiny paw on my shoulder . " See , Sambula ? Up there ? That 's the ' White Rhinoceros ... . For three days we shall have luck . And after that , who knows ! " I looked up . A crescent moon , pearly gray and scarcely visible , hung poised on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our journey . ' We paused for a rest among some tamarinds and the men fell asleep in the sweet blue shadows . I lay and watched some little black butterflies  --  thick-bodied hesperiids , quick as lightning  --  darting among a mass of convolvulus ; lighting for an instant on the edge of a blossom , uncoiling a long crimson proboscis , sinking it deep in the honeyed crevice , wings trembling with pleasure , then up and away in a swift dizzy spiral . I grew drowsy ; I fell asleep . When I awoke I saw Nimbalimba crouching on the ground ten yards away . His sparkling eyes looked tense and tender ; he was smiling oddly ; on the dark earth in front of him lay four enormous vipers , fat and flat-headed , with brilliant green scales fading into a hot rich copper , which glittered like a liquid as the snakes slowly rose and drew nearer . I was struck with horror when the boy held out his hand ; and the snakes came closer one by one and laid their poisonous heads on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies swayed in unison ; Nimbalimba was singing to them in a high warbling voice , like a nightingale 's ; he lowered his head . The snakes reared slowly , they seemed about to strike . He caressed their smooth yellow throats with his forefinger , one by one . They closed their eyes and draped themselves , like braids of copper , on Nimbalimba 's forearm while he whispered to them and kissed their hard ugly heads . They seemed to fall asleep : Nimbalimba bore them , coiled around his arms , toward the edge of the little pool and there he released them : and they floated away , heads protruding like emeralds from the black glossy water . Yalemba lay deep in a mahogany grove . The huts were built of black mud with sculptured columns of mahogany ; the walls were covered with elaborate paintings . The whole ambience of the place was that of a sepulchre . IIcre lived the tall and coppery , the sophisticated umbrella-bearing Balbongis . They greeted us with a languid elegance , lightly tinged with disdain . These at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equator . The women had tapering heads , artificially deformed , with a coiffure extending like a long dark hourglass . Everything about them was exaggerated and artful : enormously long eyelashes , long necks , hands and feet ; proud and rather indignant movements ; a fragile manner , discreetly archaic . " Their faces were flat and expressionless , with almond-shaped eyes and unbelievably small , shell-like ears . They had plucked their eyebrows into thin haughty lines , and the hairs on their bodies had been plucked entirely . This gave them the look of odd , elongated children : they looked simultaneouslyinnocent and corrupt . We saw three of them crouchingin the shade , two boys and a girl , plucking the down from their thighs with long wooden tweezers . They were calmly and utterly unashamed , the Balbongis ; especially the women ; the young girls above all . They kept strolling about in chic little groups , carrying pink and yellow parasols , gossiping slyly , with fingers extended ; speculating , it appeared , on the anatomical exploits of the males . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he observed , was expecting us for tea . So we followed him through the village , pausing here and there to accept a gracious offering  --  an ibis feather , a panther 's ear ; or to admire the mural paintings  --  zebras , elephants , antelopes . A disconcertingodor lingered about the huts . The Balbongis , we learned ,  |p109buried  their dead in the family dwelling ; so that the floor rose steadily with the passing years , and the air grew ferocious with the presence of the dead . We were led through a rambling series of corridors , through tunnels and galleries , cupolas and turrets ; poisonously filthy , all of them , and appallingly littered ; until finally we emerged into the throne room  --  a circular hut with a high thatched roof , lined with dozens of bamboo stools . At the further end sat the King , with glaring yellow eyes , white hair like lamb 's wool , and a skin of dead purple . He was preposterously , gloriously fat ; the corpulenceof the whole tribe seemed absorbed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a large patternedquilt cast over his shoulders . At his feet , gracefully intertwined , lay a tangle of black boys , festooned with strips of white and lavender cheesecloth . Near by stood a rusty kerosene stove , a scattering of marmalade jars , and a row of brilliantly polished hub caps ; remnants , I felt uneasily , of some earlier expedition . We bowed and presented ourselves . " You 'll have tea , I presume ? " said the King benignly , in rather lurid French . He raised his little finger ; someone rapped violently on a tin can . A black breastless Diana appeared with a copper tea tray on her head  --  china cups , each with its tea ball , in the American style ; lumps of sugar in a bowl , and a jar of apple jelly . It was all distinctlyalarming . " Sugar ? Milk ? " purred the King . We sat down with our cups on our knees and the conversation began . " What we need here in Yalemba , " the King announced cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you agree ? " He peered at me craftily . " Are you American ? " I confessed that I was.  | " There is much Progress in America , " declared the King , with the air of a connoisseur . " You see "  --  and he waved , rather ominously , in the direction of the marmalade  --  " I too enjoy Progress . I have a faiblesse for Progress . It appeals to my sense of the picturesque . It has charm . It has color . " He broke wind discreetly . " And now , " he sighed , " let us talk about poems . " He stared at me accusingly . " You like poems , monsieur ? " He was hideous ; a pendulous lower lip , flat and dilated nostrils , the cranium of a chimpanzee . Yet there was something vulnerable and disarming in his face , a dark despondent wisdom which lurked beneath his oddity . " We have many poems in Yalemba , " he continued in mellow tones . " We Balbongis are famous for our poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said ; a great many . " Funeral poems ? " lie said thoughtfully . " Rain poems ? Fertility poems ? " " We have every kind of poem , Your Majesty . " " And they really work ? " lie said skeptically . " They bring rain ? They eliminate witches ? " I assured lion that they did , as likely as not . He sighed . " Very well . Recite us a poem , please . " I stared into my teacup . " What type of poem , Your Majesty ? " He gazed at me reproachfully . " A beautiful poem , " he said . Then he added softly : " A poem about birds , perhaps ? " It was a painful moment . The field of occidental poetry seemed strangely inadequate , abstruse . I hesitated ; I felt myself blushing . Then I muttered some lines from " The Raven , " transposing them into an elephantine French . The monarch seemed pleased ; his eyes were twinkling . " Very fine . Very peculiar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . " He glanced with severity at the twitteringtangle of boys . " Yalemba , " he confided , " is a town of great culture . But there are times , if I may say so , when it seems a triflep111old-fashioned . A shade conservative . What do you think ? Would I like America ? Would it be an amusing journey ? " We passed into an adjoining room ; the royal boudoir , more or less . It was a dark stuffy chamber lined with hundreds of talismans . One wall was covered with long polished canes , each with a crimson rattle attached at the end ; instruments , said the King , for invoking the ancestral spirits at the annual rites . Over the royal couch hung the skin of a huge python . It was the famous Python of Yalemba , His Majesty observed with a glint in his eyes ; it was the guardian of his home , the symbol of his tribe , and the secret , he added slyly , of his own phenomenal potency . The King 's wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept languorously through the room , darting little glances in our direction . There were thirty-three in all . The King watched them with uxorious relish ; and explained in detail the amorous specialties of each . Several were pregnant and wore little strings around their loins : each bearing three black seeds ( so that the child should be well shaped ) , a little blue shell ( to prevent a miscarriage ) and a ring of zebra hair ( to combat the neighboring sorcerers ) ; as well as an eagle 's claw , to protect the child while still in the womb . They were lovely , these royal concubines , but strangely alike , almost identical , both in gesture and appearance . The whole atmosphereseemed as ritualistic as the court of Louis Quinze ; many of them , in fact , conversed in French , with an air of nervous hauteur . Their voices were high and lilting , with a strangely melancholy ring . Three young women passed by , bound together like prisoners . One of them was carrying a baby whose skull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladies from another tribe ? " we inquired politely . " No , " replied the King , curtly . " Unfaithful wives . " But adultery , he added , was of no real consequence here . All the children in Yalemba had sprung from his own loins ; he himself had fathered the whole community . It was a local custom , a tradition , a public ceremony in fact . The Balbongis , he explained , had devised their own style of contraception , and only the King remained capable of begetting . On every boy , soon after puberty , a delicate operation was performed : a small incision at the root of the penis , a kind of premature outlet ; so that at the moment of orgasm the seed fell harmlessly to the ground . Thus , he concluded proudly , all Balbongis belonged to the royal family : all were princes and princesses . His wives , furthermore , were all his own daughters . And similarly husband and wife , among the Balbongis , were alwaysbrother and sister ; and the children were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ubiquity of the royal seed . And so it went ; on and on ; the whole kingdom was drowned in incest . We were led to the guesthouse by the Prime Minister of Yalemba ; an acidulous little man with a face like a civet cat 's and , as he explained , the only surviving commoner . He too was carrying a parasol  --  a faded blue one with tassels . " How old is the King ? " asked Joshua . " All , no one knows , " sighed the Prime Minister . " A hundred and ten ; or a hundred and twenty . " We passed a group of slender girls nursing their long coppery babies . " And these arc all , " said Joshua , with a certain awe , " His Majesty 's own children ? " The Prime Minister gazed at the clouds , ambiguously . " His Majesty , " he said , " is a most remarkable man . And we Balbongis , you see , have always been great patriots .... " A sudden clamor rose from a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister uncomfortably , was the royal hospital . We glanced through the window as we passed . It was heavily barred with rods of bamboo . A great tangle of bodies lay coiled in the darkness . Some were monstrously fat ; others were leatheryp113skeletons . Some were old and white-headed and others were children . A continual murmur filled the place , punctuated now and again by a piercing scream or a fit of laughter . The smell was venomous : not only with secretion and suppuration , but with some intangible flavor , like the scent of iodine : it was the odor of madness . These were the stepchildren of Yalemba ; the incurably insane . We wandered on slowly through the mahogany trees.  |p114Night  was falling . The foliage dissolved . The distant hills drew a shawl slowly across their shoulders , and Yalemba lay wrapped in a murmuring stillness . The girls watched me lazily as I sewed a button on my trousers ; nothing moved except their eyes . There was no sound but the rustle of doves . Still , there was something repellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sucked into the swamplike stillness , like a fallen leaf . Everything seemed interwoven . Everything grew identical . The men and women all looked like twins , inexhaustible repetitions of a single mood . There was no real difference between the old and the young , or the men and the women . The young were old and the old were young ; the women had hips like a man 's and the men had eyes like a woman 's . All were slender , tall , expressionless , hairless , heartless , morally dilapidated . Girls passed in twos and threes , fingers interwoven ; the youths clung together arm in arm . Sapphism and sodomy were officially encouraged in Yalemba ; the King , it seemed , found them expedient , both psychologicallyand obstetrically . An air of sullen narcissism lurked in every Balbongi face . That anonymity , that lassitude , those strange coiffures and cranial deformities , that agonized preoccupation withp115bodily splendor  --  they were all the symptoms of a devouring illness . These people had not much longer to live , quite obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were awaited at the royal palace , he suavely informed us . The King had ordered a special festival . Not one of the great seasonal festivals , he added apologetically ; just an intimate little celebration , so to speak . Lanterns of burning palm oil had been hung from the columns , and the sculptured mahogany shone like bronze , dropping fingerlikeshadows on the smooth dark walls . The King was sitting under a mango tree in a large irregular courtyard , surrounded by his customary bevy of boys . He looked strange and rather terrifying in the lime-colored light ; covered with leopard skins and feathers , holding an enormous scepter in each hand . Someone beat on a monstrous drum ; someone else blew an ivory horn . And now the wives appeared , all thirty-three of them , clad in brilliant red loincloths and with silver studs in their crested hair . Long bowls of food were placed under the mango tree ; egg-shaped pastries , mysterious cutlets , an intimidating array of hors d'eeuvres ; dark cheeses , green custards , and a whimsical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried around , and from this we all drank : a thick , powerful liqueur that stung the senses like a hornet . The King raised his left scepter to pronounce a toast . Everyone grew still . Eyes were rolled in our direction . " You are distinguished visitors , " said the King in thundering tones , " and America is a town of great elegance and wisdom . " He coughed uneasily . " Someday we shall celebrate a fine big treaty with America . We shall send you our Oracle to select our future King . " His voice grew a little fainter . " After all , " he continued , " all men are brothers . All tribes are brave . All kingdoms are beautiful . One must be patient . One must be generous . And little by little , " he concluded , " the Evil Spirits will be cast to the winds ! " There was a delicate murmur of appreciation . Alessandro rose , somewhat nervously , to reply . " Yalemba is a town of profound hospitality and culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting peace and fertility ! " The urn was circulated once again and an elaborate dance of masks began . The men of Yalemba rose out of the shadows and slowly marched into the center of the courtyard . Gradually , almost imperceptibly , they slid into a series of oscillations , highly formalizedat first , then more and more violent , and finally drowned in a paroxysm of self-torture . Every variety of mask was there ; masks of love , masks of war , masks of worship and terrorization , masks of hawks , leopards and crocodiles . The men seemed finally to be absorbed by their masks ; their wet bodies spun agonizingly up toward the mask , their whole identity dissolved in the fever of the mask . A dreadful heaviness filled the air . They had ceased being human , their ancestral guilt vanished , their weakness and lonelinessdissolved . They once again became beasts , creatures of the undying darkness plunged in the bliss and misery of animality . One of the men now sprang in front of the King . His mask was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue snout . The lamplight flashed across his body ; gradually the color seemed to change . It turned into a pearly gray as he passed along the walls , and then to a deep rich ocher as he hovered under the mango tree . And suddenly it brightened into a clear , unmistakable green as he swung for a moment through the light below the royal cushions . His adam 's apple throbbed ; his tongue kept dartinglike a lizard 's . Finally he slipped into a corner and disappeared from sight . Now the women strode forth . The drums grew more sonorous . Their long silky bodies began to sway , like fascinated cobras . A permeating scent of ripe mangoes filled the air . The King tapped me lightly on the shoulder . His eyes werep117gleaming . " Yes , my friend ! I too was young once . Long , very long ago . I was the finest dancer in the tribe . And the finest lover . I made love , " he murmured nostalgically , " seven times a day . And later five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I was famous throughout the Congo . Yes . And not only for the frequency . For the skill as well . And for the fantasy ! " He closed his eyes with the grief of ancient memories . " And now . All is over . Youth vanishes , strength fades . Only the skill remains . And the patience , of course . Once a day is sufficient now . My fame has died throughout the Congo . Soon I 'll be forgotten .... " The drums rolled on , pierced by the rippling of a flute in the distance . Strange noises seemed to be rising from the brush  --  an orchestral accompaniment of rustlings and barkings , squeals and ululations ; the whole jungle was joining in . The Balbongi women swayed their hips and ground their shimmering thighs . The men rose out of the shadows and crept up behind them , with their furry and feathery and scaly masks . They looked like beasts of prey silently stalking their victims . The women closed their eyes in a frenzy of abandonment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpets emerged . The loincloths were dropped : the stench of perspiration spread . One of the women leapt into the center , and a buffalo mask rushed forth with a roar , drew a scimitar from its crimson sheath , flashed it about , then pointed it rigidly at the woman 's body . She gyrated like one possessed , flinging her head to left and right , drawing closer and closer to the buffalo spirit , leaning back further and further , till her long black head almost touched the ground ; her throat and belly throbbed with the pulse of her breath . She smiled with a crucial , all-enveloping resignation as the scimitar entered her sex and the drops of blood began to fall . " Cut ! Cut ! " the Balbongis cried , as the scimitar struck again and again . " Cut , cut ! " they all cried in their high desolate voices . Then the woman collapsed and was carried off to the palace . The dancers continued . It was an obscenity not merely sexual ,  | but diabolical in intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their muscles grew swollen . It was a spiritual crisis far more than a physical . The tribe was dying before our eyes ; this was their desperate last appeal , the final tableau of their impotence . The King looked subdued . He leaned over and whispered : " You see , my friend , even in this there is something sacred , something exalted . It looks rather profane , I quite agree . But there is an element in it , just a tiny element of holiness ! " He rose and nodded good night to us , and trudged lugubriously toward his royal bedchamber . And then the dance disintegrated . The glitter of limbs ; the clash of drums ; the mounting copulative rhythm : and at last a great silence , a real wilderness of silence . The oil lamps began to splutter and go out one by one . An intangible horror pervaded the mind . The human semblance had completely vanished , lost in the great crevasse of superstition . All fear , all ritual and mutilation : their sexual core lay furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkness  --  hawk 's heads , crocodile 's heads  --  hacking away at the prostrate bodies.  |p119Now  we entered a great billowing valley , with cliffs rising on either side , vertical and cavernous , like Gothic facades . This was the most idyllic place we had seen . It was like a huge park : wonderfullycool , green and shadowy , yet coruscating with colors  --  birds , butterflies , beetles , swarms of acacia and oleander . We sat down under a low dark casuarina tree . The aroma of the forest rippled about us . The air was filled with hints of the past  --  lingering rhythms , tantalizing shadows . ' Was it Italy ? Or Provence ? The illusion crumbled . All around us we heard the thin , dry squeak of the guinea fowl . Two huge turtles lumbered past , pausing every few steps , craning their wrinkled necks in a kind of senile indignation . Herds of buck and boar moved through the neighboring trees , indolent , utterly indifferent to our presence . Later , after we had filled our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance . Once there was a sudden vibration in the air . Brilliant spools of green and gold , coiled in light , shot through the boughs . They hovered , then darted , swift as the light itself . Everyone , even the monkeys , grew silent and watched ; there was something strangely thrilling in this electrical apparition , which vanished as suddenly as it had come . Hummingbirds ; the only ones I ever saw in the African wood . Joshua brought us our cigarettes ; one for each of the men ; two for Balibobotee . Oudange began to pull a thorn from the ball of his foot . Ndjoluva and Osseladossa drew their fingers through their pubic hair ; it seemed they had picked up some crab lice in Yalemba . Bambo , with his pink shirt dangling about his birdlike legs , like plumage , was peering at Joshua 's butterflies . And Abulurubegan to tell tales in his low , mournful voice . " Well , one day , " said Abuluru , with a poetical air , " an old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was early morning , and her daughter 's husband came down the path to drink at the well . He knelt down beside the water and his loinclothslipped to the ground . And the old woman marveled at his shapeliness and vigor ; she felt the wicked old itch of desire . So she cast a spell on her daughter , and changed her to a wasp . And that night she slipped softly into her daughter 's bed . . . . " The men listened gravely , like children at school . " And now , " said Nimbalimba , " the one about the buffalo , please . " " Well , " said Abuluru in a profoundly moral tone , " once a woman from Bcrbcrati fell in love with a buffalo . Every night she crept down to the swamp where the buffalo was waiting . One night her husband followed her and watched her through the leaves ; and the next night he came with seven men , and killed the buffalo . Iie held his wife over a fire : two green snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the flames .... " Abuluru looked remarkably like a mummy , dry and leathery , with skin drawn tight over a hairless skull . Sickness had stripped him of his teeth , his brows and lashes , half of his nose , one toe , and three of his fingers ; and of moral superfluities as well . His soul was as crisp and parsimonious as a skeleton.  | " Long ago , " he explained bitterly , " the whole world was covered with men . No women existed . No birds , no animals . Only fine , elegant men , who ate nothing but fruits . And then someone or other  --  a man from London , if I 'm not mistaken  --  brought wickednessinto the world . The men began to degenerate . Some shrank into women ; others into pygmies ; and others into various beasts , each according to his vice . Those without pride became dogs . Those who overate became crocodiles . Those who overtalked becameparrots . Certain others  --  you know what I mean  --  turned into monkeys . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and more and more animals . " He grew thoughtful . Then he added : " Of course , it 's not really quite as simple as that . There are other things as well . " " What other things , Abuluru ? " " Other spirits , Momboola . " " Where are the other spirits ? " " They are everywhere , Momboola . In the rocks , in the cataracts . In the manzanilla trees . In the clouds . " " Well , tell us about them , Abuluru . " But Abuluru lay down , closed his eyes , and began to snore . Now Osseladossa , the sulky one , sat down beside me . " You 've been in Russia , Sambula ? " I confessed that I had n't . He looked pained . " But you love us , Sambula ? You love the black men , do n't you ? " I nodded gently . " I love the black men , Osseladossa . But what has that to do with Russia ? " " But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men love each other . It is a law there , Sambula . A man in Libreville told me . The white love the black . The rich love the poor . And if they do n't , then . . . " He drew his finger suggestively across his neck . " Ali , perhaps , " I said dreamily . " But there are no black men in Russia . And very few rich men , Osseladossa . " " Someday , " said Osseladossa with a burst of pride , " all men will be equal . The black men will sit on thrones . The white men will carry them around in tipoys . But first everything must be destroyed , of course . " " Everything , Osseladossa ? " " Everything , " he said , with enthusiasm . " France , the Gold Coast , even America . " " And even the Congo ? " I said . He looked startled . " The Congo ? No . Of course not . Only Brazzaville , Sambula . " " Then you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " he whispered . IIc placed his hand gently on mine . " No one , Sambula . Only you . And Jassa , who is kind . And Momboola , of course . And Abuluru , who 's my cousin .... " Momboola had caught a magnificent python among the rocks . And now Balibobotec was chopping it up , basting it and seasoningit . Python cutlets , he explained , were a highly regarded delicacy ; especially when served with white ants , fried in oil . " Tell mc , Balibobotce , " I said casually : " where is this mountain Nagala ? " He looked suddenly listless . " Over there , " he said vaguely , pointing to the northeast . " You 've been there ? You 've seen it ? " " None of us has seen it , bwana . " " Oudange says that he has seen it . " " Well , Oudange may have seen it . " The scent of python meat was appalling ; I turned away in disgust . " Then you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I may have caught a glimpse of it , " he sighed , with a certain pique , casting the python skin among the bushes . " Long ,  | long ago . Who knows ? One ca n't remember everything , bwana . Nimbalimba , the one-eyed boy , came running through the trees . He seized Oudange by the arm . Three men , he cried breathlessly , were following us along the other side of the stream . He had just seen them from the top of the cliff . And later he had seen a fourth man standing motionless on a peak across the valley . " What were they ? " said Oudange calmly . " Manzabi ? " No , said Nimbalimba , they were certainly not Manzabi ; they wore loincloths , and their heads were shaved ; and they were too small for Manzabi . Oudange looked casually toward the cliffs . " Come , Momboola , " he said . The two picked up their guns without a word and went off through the wood . They came back half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They looked calm but preoccupied . Had they seen anyone ? we inquired . No one , they answered ; no one at all except an old medicine man from Xassandoa , who was looking for herbs ; a harmless little man , half dead with sleeping sickness . After dinner Balibobotee took me cautiously aside ; he placed his finger tips urbanely on my shoulder . " Do n't get excited , my dear , " he said . " Never , never get excited . As long as you 're calm , nothing bad can come to you . . . . But one thing , please . " He placed his head close to mine . " Never speak of Nagala . Never . It 's not good to speak of Nagala . . . . " Perhaps it was something in the hot black air . An indefinable sense of ambush ; just a hint of agoraphobia . I raised my eyes . The tree looked malevolent and shaggy , like a gorilla . The smell of the night was like the smell of a lair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast my shirt on a bush , and crept past the aisle of sleeping bodies , through the saplings clown to the coolness of the stream . A whittled moon , a white-hot sickle , hung from the great euphorbia . The mossy bed of the stream clung to my toes , soft and furry ; the water slid past my ankles like an eel . I caught my breath . A huge stillness swept over the valley . For an infinitesimal moment everything seemed to pause , to vibrate with the consummate balance of things , like a gyroscope spinning on a thread of wire . The wilderness lost in its savage tranquillity , the stream moving swiftly and mercurially through the night , the sharp steely moon , the massive curves of the Kulanwili : everything was poised on the edge of incandescence . It was a miraculous moment ; and a dreadful one as well . In that mighty forlornness , steeped in prehistoric undertones , yes , there was a human penumbraas well ; the tragic complexity of human feeling was there , unmistakably ; the keen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept back through the trees . The perpendicular cliffs now caught the moonlight . A row of delicate spires and turrets , and above them , a vast irregular dome ; like a great cathedral struck by an aerial bombardment . I came to a halt ; my feet began to tingle . A shape was moving just beyond the edge of the trees , passing through the cool clear dapple of light and shadow . I paused ; I slipped into a deeper slant of shadow . ' The shape drew nearer : wrapped , I thought , in a curious mist of its own , a lunar transparency . A ghost , of course . It seemed utterly natural ; reassuring almost . And then I recognized him . He turned his head very slowly , he extended his arms ; he seemed to hesitate . For a moment he vanished among the trunks : he seemed actually to dissolve like a shred of fog . I turned and began to follow . I was about to call . Then he reappeared , strangely soundless and utterly serene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful . He passed ten feet away from me , crept back through the tangle of sleepers , and lay down ; all with the stiff , hideous calm of a robot.  |p125I  followed . Yes , there he lay ; exactly as I 'd left him . Even the posture was the same , his head on its side with the lips parted , his hands curled childishly over his chest . Was it really Joshua I had seen ? Was it the real Joshua I now saw ? Or was this , after all , the phantom Joshua ? Or was indeed the phantom the reality ? And the " real , " the fleshly , the diurnal Joshua nothing but a phantom , a tremulous and intermittent facade ? The great cathedral in the distance seemed to come alive . Shadows were slowly shifting and drifting . A host of statues emerged from their niches , beckoning , praying , blessing , lamenting . I heard a faraway sound , like the squeal of an ocelot . And then the sound deepened , a spear of cloud scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , murderously on its axis.  |p126We  arrived in Xassandoa immediately after sunset . From a distance we could sec the conical straw roofs , and the plumes of smoke floating over the village : they rose and spread and mingled with the mist which rose from the mangrove-studded valley . Outside the village we passed a large new panther trap . A young male panther had been caught the night before . We saw him gliding along the walls of red earth , sinuous , inperceptible ; no more than a shadow . But something kept flickering about him strangely  --  something hot and implacable , oddly majestic . And everything in Xassandoa was shadowy , pantherlike . Women and children passed on noiseless feet , whispering quietly . The houses were circular , painted a dead maroon , and grouped rather furtively among the trees . Even the wind seemed somehow shadowy and prowling . There was a scent of boiling spices and fermentation . Some old men were sitting under a vast euphorbia tree , with a trunk ten feet thick , in the center of the village . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . The women of Xassandoa were singularly lovely : supple and erect , with skin like jet-black taffeta . They wore nothing but a bright little banana leaf  --  no rings , no bracelets , not even a feather . Unlike most women of the Congo , they were delicately buttocked ,  |p127without  a pucker of superfluous fat . And their legs were long and beautifully straight , with the feet turned out at the ankles , like a ballet dancer 's . They were easily the loveliest creatures we had seen . Their breasts were delicate and shiny , with the nipples pointingupward : like everything else about them , they had an air of crispness , of economy . The men looked like ebony statues , ponderous , uncircumcised . They wore long crimson cattails which dangled over their buttocks ; nothing at all in front . This , said Balibobotee  --  he had been in Xassandoa once before  --  was a precautionaryedict on the part of the women , who felt that any covering might conceal some fatal blemish , some crucial inadequacy . They were magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humiliated . They had the air of drones . It was the women who had all the sparkle and pride , the souplesse . As the evening light faded the air grew warm and intimate . The children , shy at first , came and clung to our arms with a musical warble . The old men grew affable ; the women smiled softly , and crept up to touch our clothes , our hands , our cheeks with their finger tips , murmuring all the while with awe and amazement . All anxiety faded away , and Xassandoa , in the twinkling darkness , seemed filled with an air of imperturbable happiness and love . Little firelights were lit here and there among the huts . Overhead hung a great white scythe , veiled by an endless procession of clouds like tufts of freshly cut hay . We sat in a circle , feeling curiously comforted , and began to sing songs  --  songs of Italy and of Ireland , of the Ticino and Tennessee . Behind us a second circle crept gradually closer . The firelight shone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they crept , like shy dusky animals . One of them , a little boy in his teens , took my hand and held it close to his face , kissed it over and over , and would not let it go . And high overhead the stars grew more and more brilliant . And then , beyond the huts , we heard a new kind of music : a tinkling of small cymbals and a chirping of flutes , like faraway laughter . Softly , around the rosy firelight , naked silhouettes began to sway , casting cobralike shadows on the village walls . The girls of Xassandoa had begun to dance . The music grew softer . A hush fell on the gathering . A black curtain was raised in one of the huts and a grandiose figure advanced , followed by a group of elderly matrons . It was Djalundo herself , whispered Balibobotee , clicking his tongue with awe . She drew closer slowly , like a ship in full sail . At last she came to a halt majestically . Everyone had risen , the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hysterically fat . She was the Queen of Xassandoa , and the only Xassandoan who indulged in the eccentricityof clothes . Every kind of robe and ornament had been cast at random on her body  --  capes and veils , shawls , scarves and aprons , scattered bits of silk and lace , countless belts and numberless gloves , chains , brooches , all in a wild disarray . Over her face she wore a mask of dark red straw . Iler actual person was invisible : nothing of Djalundo could be seen except her eyes , a dark , shrewd glitter which saw everything , and understood all . Shc sat down beside us with a kind of groan . The scent of damp old fabrics hung about her , and every movement was accompanied by a series of rustlings and tinklings . " You 're going north ? " she said slowly , turning to Alessandro . Her voice was low and casual , like a man 's . Alessandro nodded discreetly . She paused . Then she said in a cool , clairvoyant tone : " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marius . But then she added , with a note of hidden amusement : " Never mind . Do n't tell me , kalawhali , if you 'd rather not . In any case , I can neither help nor harm you . . . . So now let 's talk of other matters . " She paused ; she seemed to be chuckling , inaudibly . She turned , with a massive ripple of silks and muslins . " Here in Xassandoa , " she murmured , " it 's the women who do the fighting . It 's the women who do everything . The hunting , the fishing , the building , the love-making . The men just lie in the sun , weavingThe Panther 129p129baskets , gossiping . When they grow older they take care of the children and learn to do a bit of cooking . . . . Yes , it works out very well . " Everyone listened in deep silence . The slender young dancers stood in a row beside the fire and the matrons sat in a group , smoking long green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone craftily behind the mask . " I 've been running Xassandoa for more than forty years , " she grunted . " Everything has improved : no wars , no famines , no miscarriages . Only women know how to rule without greed , without vanity . . . . Only women are selfless , free of illusion . Only women are really brave . The men live on fantasies . They have only one advantage , to be perfectly frank . " " And what is that , Your Majesty ? " " Oh well , " she said grudgingly , " the males are more beautiful , naturally . Just as with the birds and the beasts . They are omaments , you understand . Good for nothing except bringing more women into the world .... " She gestured faintly with one of her white-gloved hands . The music was resumed ; the dancers moved in a circle . It was an intricate , faintly baroque kind of music , and the gestures were intensely formalized , precise . The Queen leaned a little closer ; she spoke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? Up there in the north ? What is wrong ? " " Well , " I began , " there has been a troublesome war , Your Highness ... " " No , no , " she grumbled . " I do n't mean your wars and explosions . I mean your gods . What on earth has happened to them ? Have you destroyed them ? Have you abandoned them ? " I scarcely knew what to say . " They 've been hidden away , Your Highness . In museums , in libraries . Someday , possibly ... " She shook her head impatiently . " Listen , " she whispered hoarsely . " You think , you in the north , that you have left us far behind ? That you have learned the secret of happiness ? That we waste our lives in dream and folly ? Listen , kalawhali . You have very much to learn . You have traveled far , no doubt : but the road , my dear , was the wrong one . You have built big things : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done yawns a horrible illusion . . . . I pity you , kalawhali . Stay with us ! Grow wise ! " The dance came to an end , the music drifted away . The dancers wandered up and crouched beside us , and laid their coal-black heads affectionately on our knees . One , the sweetest of all , took Marius by the hand , pressed her lips to his fingers , and drew him gently into the darkness . Djalundo watched them go . She grew silent and preoccupied . " Who was that ? " I asked her . " That was Makonji , " she whispered heavily . " She is very lovely , " I said . " Yes , " said the Queen , nodding her mighty head ; " Makonji is very lovely . Very young . Very proud . And very wild .... " Dawn crept through the village ; and we went to visit the Oracle . We were led in single file to a dark grove of trees  --  so dark that it felt like a great vaulted cellar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roasted flesh  --  a dog , possibly , or a baby jackal . We waited . Balibobotee clapped his hands softly . And presently the Oracle appeared  --  a pudgy , turtle-faced man , with a huge headdress of feathers , and covered with an array of teeth , claws , ears and withered members . He ignored us entirely , and slid promptly into a trance : he closed his eyes , clenched his teeth , and began to tremble . From somewhere in the wood rose a sound of drums and cymbals . The rhythm accelerated : he coughed and spat , and fell into a series of convulsions . His muscles protrudedp131like strings and wires ; his breasts quivered ; his belly shimmered . Foam shot from his lips ; he belched , groaned and urinated . Then he knelt and sprinkled grains of sand over his body ; he snatched at the glowing embers and scattered them over his thighs . Then he collapsed with a great howl , and lay muttering on the ground . After it was all over I turned to Balibobotee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did the Oracle have to say ? " Balibobotee shrugged his shoulders and snapped his yellow braces . He looked somewhat abashed . " Oh , something about the weather . Rains , and so on . Nothing unusual . " " Nothing about our voyage ? " " No . Nothing at all , " sighed Balibobotee . We wandered back along the stream to Xassandoa . The morning was full , the day had begun . The old men were lying on the banks , blinking and scratching . Two portly matrons sat on a rock with their fishing poles . Goats were wandering along the shore and grazing and a flock of doves went fluttering low over the field . The stream curved and deepened beside a small cliff . Five or six girls were splashing about in the water , darting up and down and in and out like sea lions . Then they dove , one by one , from the top of the cliff : feet first , pinching their nostrils and squealing with excitement . Their wet black skin shone with a reddish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we left , around a dwarf banana tree , carefully choosing their new dresses for the day . They hovered over each leaf , examining it like a piece of millinery , measuring and stroking it with their fingers , peering over each other 's shoulders . Then each broke off a leaf and fastened it deftly to a string of giraffe hair ; while the rest stood by murmuring , nodding , cocking their heads . Ip132We thanked Djalundo , gathered our men , and started lightheartedlydown the path . As we entered the wood a dark figure ran after us , waving her arms , her thick hair streaming . " Wait ! " she cried . " Wait for me ! Wait , Marissa ... " We paused . Marius turned , hesitated , then walked on with a tense , preoccupied air . The girl ran after him and touched him lightly on the shoulder ; she began to plead in an impassioned murmur ; she seized his hand and held it to her lips . But Marius tore it free and walked on without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around his neck . " Take me with you , " she sobbed . " Take me with you , Marissa ! " But Marius hurled her loose and walked silently on , while the Negroes watched solemnly , with a curiously detached air . Makonji fell to the ground and lay weeping in the dust . We continued ; and soon she was hidden by the trees . But we could still hear her crying , calling his name again and again.  |p133We  passed a shallow lake , half hidden by bamboos and covered with thousands of amber lilies . We were desperately thirsty ; we came to a halt . " No , no , " said Oudange quickly . " Wicked water , bwana . This is Moona M'noo . The Lake of the Little Devils . " I leaned over and dipped my hand in the pool : the water was swarming with great black leeches . We came to a narrow red plateau , stained with the droppings of hawks and vultures . Everywhere we saw spiders , immense and shaggy , leaping from rock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was called Koum G'wami ; or the Cemetery of the Bandits . Then the land fell again . Everything changed color . The soil grew black and abnormally fertile . We felt a momentary relief ; there was an illusion of freshness . Bell-shaped fungi , white as snow , covered the soggy earth . Muli-Whala , the spot was called : or Dead Men 's Toes . This was the seventeenth day after our departure from Quame . We still felt reasonably vigorous . But we had all lost weight . We still felt strong of heart , but a peculiar sultry instability , a kind of disorientation was beginning to creep into our minds.  | " Now we approach the sultanate of the Manzabi , " said Balibobotee , demurely winding a small turban around his head . " We must be tactful with the Manzabi . " " Tactful ? " Balibobotee explained . " Praise them . Flatter them . Tell them they are brave . Tell them they are beautiful and virile . " " Yes ? Are they dangerous ? " " Oh no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balibobotee , scratching his behind . " They are sensitive and sad . They are dying out , you see . Their babies are all born blue and very small , no larger than a rabbit . And quite , quite dead . So one must be tactful . Tell them they are quick as leopards . Tell them they are fierce as buffaloes . " We entered the sultanate . A party of horsemen appeared in the east , sending up clouds of dust which hung in the air without moving . They arrived at a trot and dismounted under a tamarisk : they were emissaries of the Sultan , they explained to Abuluru , whom they seemed to recognize . One was old and very stout ; the rest were young and abnormally muscular . None appeared to be Negroes : they had the keen , Asiatic features of the Arab . We all sat down . Balibobotce brought them coffee . Everyone was intensely polite . " You do us a great honor , " murmured the plump emissary , " in visiting our land . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The Sultan wishes to see you , by the way . " And so they accompanied us  --  Alessandro , Marius , Joshua , myself  --  intothe village . " Be discreet , " whispered Balibobotee hastily as we mounted the horses . " Tell them they are irresistible . Tell them they are the lords of the universe . " A faintly ominous atmosphere hung over the village . No women were to be seen . The Sultan 's guards , dark sulky animals , were sitting about under the trees , clutching their spears . Now we caught sight of the Sultan , crouching under a tattered canopy , being fanned by a colossal black athlete . There was an unmistakableair of tension . Alessandro advanced , performed a kind ofThe Bull 135p135salaam , and declared in haphazard Swahili : " We have come a long way , Your Highness . We heard you were mighty and brave ; more than mighty and brave ; the flower of Africa . . . . We are weary and hungry . " Everyone brightened and relaxed . The Sultan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the tribe , it seemed ; finely featured , gracious , serene , circumspect . He asked us to sit down . A bowl of milk was brought presently , and a bowl of sugared nuts , and then a bowl of highly pungent meat , which we ate with misgivings . Excellent , we declared ; what sort of meat was it ? Oh , said the Sultan cheerfully , the genitalia of a certain type of baboon , which was very plentiful in this region : it was the favored dish of the Manzabi . Then he asked , in guarded tones , about Europe and America : about the cinema , the airplane , the radio , and so on . He listened politely , with his thumb against his chin . But it was clear that he looked on these matters as fantasy ; they did n't exist in fact ; merely as figments of superstition in the volatile Western mind . Then he beat , very lightly , on a small black drum . There was a rustling and tinkling among the leaves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They must have been watching the whole time , hidden among the shrubs . They paraded past us with an air of absent-minded elegance and reclined at the further end of the piazza . The Manzabi women were distinctly odd ; they caught the eye . They were stark naked but bespangled with ornaments : neck and ankles , nose and fingers , all were laden with silver . Their earlobes , weighted with coins , hung down to the shoulders . Their breasts , transfixed with rings , fell below the navel . Even the most intimate phase of their anatomy , shaved and pierced with tiny chains , was stretched almost to the knees . They lived , it seemed , in perpetual pain . Everything glittered and rattled as they passed through the clearing . Their eyes were limpid and resigned , like a cow 's . Most of the warriors , too , were rather heavily decorated  --  with silver , with beads , with powder and paint . One type of ornament seemed a little odd . Many youths wore black stones , egg-shaped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virile . Why was this , we inquired ; did it bring good luck ? " Well , not precisely luck , " said the Sultan gravely . " The women stretch their breasts , you see , for the sake of beauty . And the men stretch their g'wamo for the sake of dignity . It is all perfectly logical . " The Sultan invited us to spend the night . It was growing late ; we nodded gratefully . The dishes were removed . Large earthenwaregoblets were brought . The ladies retired , gliding back through the piazza with bewildered , undulating gestures . There was one girl , extremely tall , black and stately , who looked like an Ethiop . " Who is that ? " I asked casually . " The tall girl ? That , " replied the Sultan , " is Kwangu . " " Is she a Manzabi ? " I inquired . The Sultan pursed his lips ; he looked pained . " Well , not exactly . But . . . " He hesitated . " Yes , Your Higliness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed . A light wind passed through the valley . It was like a distant voice , an ardent call out of an immeasurable past . I heard the leaves clicking lightly : dark shapes were wandering through the palms . I heard a broken murmur , ever so faint : someone was praying . And then I heard something else . An unmistakably human utterance ; remote as a star and yet very close beside me , sad yet exultant , tender yet ruthless . Someone was singing , but not in Swahili . I could n't understand a word . It rose to a climax , hoarse , erotic , and then gradually fell away . It lingered a moment , then seemed to cease . But then several notes followed , casually , likep137an afterthought . And in that moment the whole disconsolate magic of the song crystallized . The whole hot poignance , instantaneous , incommunicable , hung before me like a ray of light . The world seemed fearfully sad and anarchic , and yet obscurely interwoven , somehow redeemed by the human element . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned over on my cushion . A hand reached out and touched my forehead very softly . " Yes ? " I said . " Who are you ? " No one replied . But now I saw , crouching low on the ground beside me , the shape of a woman . I saw the dim glow of metal ; the suggestion of bracelets and rings and anklets . A hand rose again , lay lightly on my shoulder . " Who are you ? " I repeated . And the woman cried softly , with a kind of humble despair , and vanished into the night . All I heard was a faint rattling among the palms , like the noise of a katydid . Then I fell asleep gradually . The swaying leaves touched my forehead . Or perhaps they were human fingers . A procession of men passed by very slowly , small men with Assyrian features and tiny ringlets which covered their heads and bellies . Their eyes were lowered , they seemed to be praying . Behind them , led on a golden chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on they went . Through gurgling swamps and scorching valleys , past raging torrentsand windy cliffs . ' Where were they going ? I asked various strangers who were kneeling by the wayside ; but none of them knew , not a single one . Dreams ; what in the world can we really say about them ? Their mystery is infinitely more than a thing of symbols , omens , parallels . Their depth , their terrible resonance , has scarcely been stirred . For it 's the whole vast catalogue of man 's soul which creeps , ever so furtively , along that echoing corridor . It 's our dreams which bind , like an umbilical cord , each separate spirit to the whole of the tribe ; and indeed to the whole dark reservoir of human experience . The individual dissolves , the dreamer becomes the race , the dream becomes the ever-widening net of ancestral memory ,  | century upon century of it , continent upon continent , made real and peculiarly poignant by our own microscopical role . There it is . The human ache , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which passes on and on through the silent waters . We feel that subtle , dangerous air of recognition , as we move through regions where we 've never set foot ; that haunting air of memory , saturated with premonition , as we float through years which have yet , perhaps , to come into being . Yes , there it is ; the human enigma , like a bloodstained fetus . A single glimpse and it 's gone , nothing but the throbbing ache remains . For we 're frightened , every last one of us ; wildly , agonizingly frightened . In the morning a group of murmuring old women had gathered at our door . All held babies in their arms , or little children by the hand . They 'd been waiting patiently since dawn . The children looked like pitiful gnomes ; with their twisted legs and swollen bellies , their rachitic faces with blue-black eyes . We got ready to leave : they wailed , they knelt and pleaded . Joshua gave them some soda tablets and squeezed sulfa ointment on the open sores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reverence . Their faith was desperate , absolute . They looked almost ecstatic when he touched their wounds with the white salve . One of the Sultan 's guards ran up and seized Joshua by the hand . " Come ! Come ! " he said breathlessly . " Ign'haiana ! " We were led to a hut on the edge of the village . It was dark and stifling and stench-ridden inside . Black shapes were standing along the wall , and in the center , on the ground , lay a large confusedmass , from which a revolting odor rose : an old , old woman , monstrously fat , tangled in rags . The whole of her left leg was iridescent with gangrene . A very young girl sat huddled beside the body . The Bull 139 " Save her , " she whimpered in a kind of trancelike singsong . " Save her , save her ... " But it was too late , of course . There was nothing to be done . Death was very near . The old woman began to mutter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She says she wishes to die , " said the guard . " But she is afraid of the birds . " " Of the birds ? ' Which birds ? " The guard looked at him reproachfully . Then he looked away again , without replying . We walked back to the village piazza to say good-by to the Sultan , who was sitting absent-mindedly under the canopy . " You may stay with us , " he said , with a touch of embarrassment , " if you wish . " " We must go on , " said Alessandro . " We will treat you well , " pleaded the Sultan . " We will bringyou honey every day , and milk , and the balls of young baboons . " " Ah , " said Alessandro with a sigh : " we must go on to thenorth . " " We will give you gold and silver , " said the Sultan , with intensity . " Stay ! Stay ! We will give you anything you wish , anything .... " " You have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alessandro . " Kind ? " he said disparagingly . " Not at all . Not at all . " " We are all eternally grateful . " " No , " he said in a tone of alarm ; " do not be grateful , please . " " Good-by , then , Your Highness . " " Oh , good-by . . . good-by . . . " Tears had come to his young enormous eyes . Then he seized me by the arm and drew me anxiously to his side . " Do not go deeper in that direction , " he whispered , pointing to the north . " The land is full of danger . You will be attacked . Night and day . By men with knives ; by buffalo and the lion ; by thep140great White Scorpion ; and , above all . . . " He paused . There was something he felt impelled to say , but somehow dared not say . He gulped ; he closed his eyes . The moment was over . He smiled and we left him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About the Sultan 's conversation , the sick children , the dying woman ; and then about the final incomprehensible warning . Oudange listened carefully . He shrugged his vast shoulders . Then he fixed us with his bold , intelligent eyes . " What did you dream last night , bwana ? " We hesitated ; none of us remembered , quite . " Was it about the bull , bwana ? Led to slaughter among the hills ? " I glanced at Marius and Alessandro . Both of them looked startled . And Joshua began to nod , a little uneasily . P141We were skirting the vast , depopulated savannahs to the west . The land grew alive . Great ringing torrents shot through the ravines and echoed angrily in the caves . Our malaise left us utterly ; we felt miraculously well . Wild animals were stirring among the glades : antelopes , blue fallow deer , and once , even , a pair of giraffes . But soon an air of anxiety returned . Abuluru scratched his head . Oudange sniffed the air . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have joy , " said Abuluru grimly . " But soon comes trouble , bwana ! " Far away we saw the Lungali hills , squat and symmetrical as turtles . There was a smell of wild thyme in the gullies , a thrilling sense of the unexplored . The deer paused and gazed at us with a velvety curiosity . Three or four came wandering toward us with yearning eyes and quivering nostrils . And a group of small autoeroticmonkeys performed among the boughs , swinging about like trapeze artists . Fear did n't exist here ; until Ndjoluva shot a doe , and then , at the sound of the gun , they all instinctively knew that death had come , and sprang wildly into the thicket . The Sultan had lent us several porters and tipoys  --  hanging chaises longues suspended between strips of bamboo , each carried by four men . The motion was abrupt , like that of a rowboat in rough sea ; the smell of the porters grew sharp and rancid ; the sound of panting and grunting grew thoroughly wearisome ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat under the matted roof , pierced like a sieve by needles of light . But we kept on riding . It seemed ungrateful , even unwise , to send back the porters so early in the day . We crossed a swaying bridge of lianas ; far , breathtakingly far below us coiled a thin white torrent . We passed , on the edge of a cliff , three potbellied hunters who had caught a gorilla . They were exuberant ; they clapped their hands and whistled with joy . The gorilla , it seemed , was a pregnant female : an extraordinary omen of luck as well as an appreciable source of income . The ape lay tangled in the net , insanely ugly and exhausted , wringing her great blue paws and urinating with terror . And a little farther on we passed a group of natives , both men and women , bony suppurating creatures , marching in single file . A long heavy rope bound them together , neck to neck ; and they were flanked by four gigantic askaris , armed with long rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local laws for forced labor . A cruel punishment , I said to Ndjoluva ; why was it so cruel ? " Cruel ? Cruel ? " murmured Ndjoluva , with a wicked smile ; as though I had just invented an amusing new word . We entered a narrow valley , and the air grew like lead . The leaves hung limp and viscous from the branches . The tipoy carriers were bathed in sweat : their yellow loincloths were dripping . The saturated air clung to the flesh like oil . The smell of human slavery grew absolutely nauseating . I leaned out of the tipoy and was violently ill ; then I crawled out , with a grunt of apology , and followed on foot . Now we passed a richly cultivated region ; great fields of cotton , interspersed with fields of manioc , tidily cut into rectangles . Onep143felt the presence of an alien influence . And for a moment the sense of resonance , of irrationality , dissolved . But then a great cloud , massive and mottled , appeared in the north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Ndjoluva 's eyes shone like candles . Faint flashes of light rose at the end of the valley . A wind sprang from nowhere , a nervous agitationseized the trees . And then a zigzag of lightning shattered the sky from the Kulanwili hills . The sky looked savage , apocalyptic , receding in dome upon dome of darkness . Huge drops of rain began to fall , driving their way through the air like bullets . The brittle leaves began to click like a metronome . And then the mist parted . The rain lessened ; it ceased . The sunlight swung down on the valley like a club . Nimbalimba , the one-eyed boy , came and walked at my side . He was the youngest and slenderest of the porters . He was wearing his moth-eaten scarlet fez . A row of virulent boils covered his thighs and buttocks . Joshua had treated and bandaged them : the pain must have been hideous , but the medical ritual had put the boy in an exultant mood . Alessandro had given him a cheap Italian wrist watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Today you feel happy , Sambula , " he said , smiling . He had a beautiful cool voice , like an elderly woman 's . " Yes . Today I feel happy . " " You smell happy , Sambula ; like watercress . I always know how a man feels . I know by his smell . If he lies , he smells sour . If he is afraid , he smells raw . If he is angry , he smells like a turtle . If he is lustful , he smells like bamboo root . I can always tell with a man . " " Yes ? And with a woman ? "   " Well , with a woman , " Nimbalimba confessed , " it is different . I can not guess a woman 's mind . I can tell if she is a virgin , or a mother , or a she-dog . I can tell if she itches for a man , or has milk in her breasts , or a child in her womb . That is all . Women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he whispered : " It 's a good thing we have no woman with us , Sambula . In this country a woman brings bad luck on a voyage . An old woman brings hunger . A young woman brings thirst . A child woman brings the tsetse . And a baby woman brings death . " In Bundawala a torrent ran streaming through the village . Houses of straw stood huddled on both banks , shining with spray . It was a paradise of sound and color and light ; a delirium of animal and vegetable brightness . Naked girls darted in and out of the current , their white teeth flashing , their voices twittering . Beyond rose the mimosa-covered slopes of the Kulanwili , and the brilliant tresses of bougainvillaea . Beyond , at a turn of the stream , lay the modern town : a hodgepodgeof plaster and corrugated iron , of weather-cracked facades and splintered windows . Weeds were growing from the roofs . Ants and arachnids filled the crevices . And suddenly , through some stroke of solar magic , some metamorphosis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreal  --  people , trees , the very air . The women wore skirts of a faded red poplin , over which their breasts dangled like chocolate pears . The men wore straw hats and tattered blue shirts which floated preposterously in the breeze , like butterfly wings . Little babies were hanging from the walls , wrapped in leaves , cocoon-like . I felt like laughing , shouting , leaping in the air out of sheer irresponsibility . The bandage of reason had snapped . Cause and effect broke like bubbles . One of those moments , it was , when Africa takes a leap into pure fantasy , and acquires a flavor beyond analysis  --  a touch of legend , of caprice , of absurdity , of immensity , and of something beyond any of these ; P145what Momboola called kamb'naga , some marvelous exhilaration for which we have no longer the word , nor the capacity . We paid a visit on the resident physician , Dr. Yusupov ; a ' White Russian , pallid , enervated , in his early fifties . His office was painted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Czar , the Czarina , and the Czarevitch . But they no longer , one felt , portrayed a faith or a hope ; they were merely emblems of dislocation , of abandonment . He served us bitter tea and undrinkable rum . " Well , it 's difficult here , " he informed us petulantly . He spoke in a slow , depleted murmur . " Very difficult , you know . One must keep struggling or submit . And one ends by turning into a ghost . It 's wrong , let me tell you . Atrocious . " Yusupov was a tall , angular , broad-hipped man with protruding ears and a protruding adam 's apple . Everything about him seemed vaguely androgynous . His eyes were blurred with self-pity . He turned his narrow head and called , rather timorously : " Shela ! " There was a little cough of exasperation in the next room . Then the curtains parted . A dark young woman entered , slowly and listlessly : not a beautiful woman , quite , but physically startling , pungent . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mongolian ; her eyes were hard and keen as an egret 's . She wore a long low dress of scarlet muslin , which clung to her thighs like a serpent 's skin . The atmosphere in the room changed instantly : it grew tense , almost alarming . The moment she entered she imperceptibly straightened . Her eyes grew defiant , then piercing and calculating . She stood beside the tea table , languidly lit a cigarette , placed one hand on her hip , coughed lightly , and poured herself a cup of tea . There was something vaguely false and even ludicrous in all this ; and yet something naive as well , almost touching .   " My wife , " said Yusupov in a mild , plaintive tone ; and added : " Sit down , my dear . " But she sauntered to the window without a word , drew her hands along the curtains , and stared sullenly at the palms . Yusupov lit his pipe and continued wearily : " I 've been here seventeen years . Yes , right here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And before that , for three unspeakable years , in the Cameroons . I know this part of the world , I may say ... " His voice trailed away . Rays of light shot through the palms like stilettos of fire ; a hornet was buzzing along the ceiling . " A kind of madness , " whispered Yusupov , " hangs over Africa like a mist . Wherever you go  --  in the towns , in the woods , in the savannahs  --  the Negro lives under a self-inflicted thrall . Magic , trance , paranoia : call it anything you wish . He staggers through a perpetual mental twilight . Here 's the key to the African mystery : they 're all insane ; they 're all lunatics ! " He talked on and on . ' flit afternoon deepened . The paws of sunlight crept infinitesimally across the floor . The woman stood fierce and brooding beside the window ; the hornet kept buzzing along the ceiling . " Disgust , " said Yusupov . His voice sank to a whimper . " Disgust : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetation . With the worms and the spiders . With the shattered vitality of the people , with the idiocy of their lives , with the squalor and superstition of their souls . And oh , with the utter , the abysmal monotony ! With the nauseating uniformity of the jungle , worse than the desert or the sea ! Trees , villages , faces , souls : they scarcely matter , they 're all the same . No point in thinking , down here on the Equator ; no point in working or rebelling . There 's nothing , nothing but a suffocating mass of leaves and bodies . Africa is a corpse . And we , gentlemen , are the maggots . " Silence filled the little room . The old imperial photographs looked down from the crimson walls with a kind of snarl .   " How long , " sighed Yusupov , with a gasp of exhaustion , " how long will they tolerate us ? When will the massacres begin ? .. . Yes , we 're criminals  --  you and I , and the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away like criminals ; in flesh and in soul .... " From Bundawala the path led through a broad grassy plain . And then over sand of a muddy , moribund hue : a withered lake , apparently . And then through stray bits of swamp , broken by syrupy ponds which were filled with canary-colored lilies , and then through a grove bright with banyan and mimosa . Now and again we passed a group of sickly young men , all with desperately infected eyes and curiously long , spidery legs ; all of them carrying bright azure bags on their backs  --  sugar or salt , or textiles , possibly . We had left the tipoys behind in Bundawala ; we did the whole day 's journey on foot . We came to . a halt , toward dusk , beside a long lily pond . Here the grass was firm and clean and the men went swimming ; except for Nimbalimba , who hid bashfully among the reeds . I could see his bright red fez among the cattails . Manioc was distributed , and strips of sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Abuluru produced a large green jug of p'mori which he 'd stolen in Bundawala . We sipped it , one by one : it was bitter and raw , and had the sentimentalizingeffect of vodka . " Let us all , " cried Osseladossa , " forget the past ! Let us drinkto each other ! Let us be friends forever and ever .... " " Let us drink to Assanda , " said Ndjoluva : " he is weary but wise . " " And let us drink to Jassa , " said Oudange , " he is sad but gentle . " " Let us drink to Marissa , " said Ndjoluva . " He is cruel butstrong . " " And let us drink now to Sambula . He is homely but patient , " said Oudange .   Nimbalimba leaned over and whispered tipsily in my ear . " Everyone , you see , Sambula , possesses two hearts . " " One good and one bad ? " I murmured suspiciously . " Oh no , " he said in a reassuring tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies . And one that creeps along on the ground . " We finished the p'mori . Momboola smashed the jug on a rock in a fit of joy . The sun was beginning to set . The air was like crystal , the light had never appeared so exultant , so glorious ; gold , living gold ran down the branches in the narrow streams , rippled over the grass and swarmed through the cattails . And the men , inspired by the p'mori , began to boast of their powers of love . " One night , down in Libreville , " said Momboola , the pockmarkedone , " I made love to a lady eleven times . Eleven distinct times . And each was better than the one before . " " One night in Massakori , " said Abuluru defiantly , " I made love to eleven different ladies . Yes . 1 do not lie . Eleven passionate ladies ; and they all went home happy " ' " Well , " roared Osscladossa , shaking his fist , " why do you tell such trivialities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Banana , and not too long ago , I made love to eleven different ladies , and to each eleven times . Yes , I cut a notch each time in the tree beside us . And the tree is still there , if you do n't believe me ! A fine old baobab , half a kilometer from the beach ! " " Come , Osscladossa , " said Bambo , rather wistfully , " show us your crocodile . " Osseladossa grinned and proudly showed us his crocodile ; a tattoo ingeniously engraved on his person , a tiny lizard which , with a bit of encouragement , grew into a fierce , scaly crocodile . " That 's his way , " said Abuluru , with a wink , " of flattering the Crocodile Spirit . " " And what about you , Balibobotee ? " said Momboola insinuatingly . " Me ? " said Balibobotee with hauteur . " I do n't need crocodiles to please the ladies ! "   " Well , and you , Oudange ? " Momboola turned his little mandrill eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity hung over him like a cloak , hiding the hot bitter turbulence in his heart . We grew drowsy . The sun sank ; the lily pool grew misty . And presently Ndjoluva began to sing in his low , heart-rending voice : songs of arrogance , of dread , or unfulfillable yearning . And then , just before darkness fell , we all grew alert . We opened our eyes and sat up : we glanced about and listened . " Did you hear something odd ? " said Momboola in a whisper . Nimbalimba rose to his feet . " I smell a woman , " he said softly . And a pang of uneasiness seized us all . What disturbed us ? What was happening ? Nothing tangible , certainly : nothing visible in the least . Perhaps it was merely the p'mori . A bewilderment had touched us ; a faint whiff of chaos . We rose . Osseladossa opened the bags and prepared our beds . Ndjoluva gathered some twigs and built a fire . None of us spoke . We suddenly felt very tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood . We heard footsteps , and then a low voice among the leaves . " We are friends , " said someone in a dark sullen tone . A shape rose from the lianas ; noiselessly and sinuously , as though the vines had congealed into smooth black flesh . Then we recognized him : a young guide , a kiongozi , whom we 'd met in Bundawala , who had begged to go with us as far as Zoanda . He was a powerful truculent fellow , built like an ape , with a skull like an ape 's . He came to a halt and waited , half defiant , half pleading . His ugly flat eyes were shining in the firelight . Oudange rose calmly . " Why have you come , Koloke ? " " I have brought . . . " he began . And then another figure emerged from the leaves behind him : a shape so utterly incongru- ous , so bright and bizarre , that the whole scene took on a theatrical absurdity . It was Yusupov 's wife . She strolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair with a casual gesture , plucked at her tattered red dress , then turned and faced us with an air of defiance . " Well , I decided to join you , " she said in a cool flat tone : she spoke a fluent colonial French . " What has happened ? " said Alessandro , rather tensely . " Happened ? " she said , with disgust . " Nothing . Nothing at all . That 's it , exactly . Nothing has happened . For weeks , for months , for years ! " Her voice rose , her eyes grew fiery . " Nothing , not even a caress . Not even a quarrel , not even a blow ! He 's not a man . He 's a worm ; a great white slug ! " She sat down with a sigh of exhaustion . Balibobotee brought her some tea and a biscuit . Joshua gave her a cigarette . " And now ? " said Alessandro , with a veiled antagonism . " Where do you plan to go ? " She shrugged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Bukandu . . . . We 'll see . From Bukandu I can get to Fort Archambault . " " So you 're running away , " murmured Alessandro . " Well , we 're not going to Bukandu , unfortunately . " She raised her eyes ; she looked at him with sudden fury . " You 're not ? Very well . It does n't matter , God knows . . . . " She turned her head ; she looked at the rest of us , slowly , one by one ; and then she smiled . The firelight leapt , and her face and body took on a subtle animation . Her weariness left her . And at that moment she looked , not beautiful quite , but oddly magnificent . P151A peculiar little man came wandering through the trees , ringing a small bronze bell . On top of his head he wore the head of a lynx , and on top of that , at a coquettish angle , a long blue feather . " Well , " said Oudange affably : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to , Ujiji ? Where are you going ? " The old man peered at him reproachfully . He was warped and cracked , all covered with scars and black as a panther , with a yellow tangle of beard , like a great dahlia ; and he smelled like a carcass . " Going ? " he whimpered . " Just on and on . Toward the edge of the world . Where did I see you last ? In Kumbala , was n't it ? You were just a baby then . I never forget faces . ' Well , I 'm growing old ; very old . " He opened his eyes a little wider . The whites were a dirty beige , heavily veined ; the irises were a shaggy purple . He gazed at us carefully : a gaze that seemed to glide deeper and deeper : a gaze of wonder , then of consternation , then successively of rage , pity and oblivion . He shook his head , tugged at his beard , and continued eerily on his way.  | " Good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept among the trees . But there was no answer ; none , except the tinkling of his little bell , dying away among the shadows . We went on . First came Oudange , and then Marius and Alessandro . Then came Shela , with Koloke carrying her sack . Then came Ndjoluva and Bambo , Nimbalimba and Momboola , Abuluru and Osseladossa , all heavily laden ; then Joshua and I. And last of all , plaintive and pendulous , poor old Balibobotee . But a new alertness had entered the procession . Shela 's presence had subtly galvanized us all . Her shape was like a scarlet thread drawn , unexpectedly , through the chaotic monotony of trees . It gave point ; it gave tension ; a new arriere-pensee had entered our lives . We seemed to be moving through an eternity of trees . Still , insect-laden trees soaked in an endless sea of sunlight . Little by little a sense of the uncanny crept over us . Our shadows grew longer in the deepening afternoon . And mile by mile , as the forest darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller . The land lost its color . Shape , light and mood , all grew somber , insubstantial . Once we were drenched in a strange noiseless shower . From the leaves high above us a vast horde of caterpillars  --  thousands and thousands  --  fell to the ground , quite inexplicably . We were covered with furry shapes of a brilliant indigo , which crept convulsivelyover our arms and hands and hair . We shook them off ; there were thousands more . We stepped gingerly over their crushed bodies : the air was filled with a peppery scent . Then the wood grew still darker . Our shadows were lost in the all-enveloping shade . The light grew blue and watery . The Negroes glanced about uneasily .   " Turn this way , bwana , " said Koloke suddenly , tugging at Alessandro'ssleeve . His small eyes were shining gently , like a chimpanzee 's . We paused . Oudange shook his head impassively and wandered on . " Wait , " whispered Koloke , turning to Marius ; his eyes shot a vicious little look at Oudange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings trouble . Yes , yes , believe me ! " Oudange turned a second time and looked at him gravely . There was a sparkle of hidden conflict ; a microscopical hint of fury . Koloke looked down at the ground , and we followed Oudange . Now we were enclosed in a perpetual twilight , penetrated , like a daydream , by streaks of light and fluttering birds . Once , deep in the stillness , there was the agonizing scream of a parrot ; and then a desperate flurry of wings , which gradually died away . And once Ndjoluva took a random shot at a boar , half hidden among the trunks . He missed ; the boar plunged furiously through the underbrush . Ndjoluva tried again . But the bullet went wild : and then we heard , in the gray distance , a quick low cry . We entered a glade , surrounded by tiny black huts . A group of withered creatures hovered in the center , murmuring gently . They watched us pass with a kind of frozen melancholy : only their filmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small shape lay on the ground , covered with a dark tattered blanket . Oudange knelt down and lifted the cloth : a little girl lay there , her face and shoulders covered with blood . Oudange looked up ; he glanced swiftly at Ndjoluva . The villagers stood in a circle , silent and inscrutable . " What happened ? " said Oudange . But the villagers gazed past him with a heartbroken dignity . " She is dead , " said Oudangc . A vague ripple ran through the villagers ; they nodded faintly , and there was a great dark sigh . " What was her name ? " said Oudange.  | But no one answered . They seemed to be waiting . They stared at the sky , as though in expectation of some supernatural verdict . Oudange closed his eyes and bowed his head . He looked as though he were praying . And the villagers suddenly melted , they buried their faces in their hands , then drifted noiselessly into the wood . Oudange turned his head and looked up at us with deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped it on the dead girl 's wrist . Then he rose and we went on our way . The path led past a tiny stream , then through a narrow gully filled with stunted acacia . We heard a faint rustling behind us ; a twig snapping , nothing more . We paused and turned . Among the deep gray shadows , scarcely discernible , stood an aisle of gazing , grief-stricken apparitions . The whole village was stealthily following us , driven by some bizarre passion . They were wringing their hands and rolling their eyes . And then , as we continued on our way , they began to chant softly . We hurried on , touched and troubled . Bambo 's eyes were huge with dread . And it grew contagious : I too felt a tingling sensation , a hot , exhilarating rush of energy ; the first brief pang of hysteria . Now and again one of us turned . A dead branch fell : we were petrified with alarm . Once we heard a distant rumbling . Drums in the valley ? Or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we saw a row of tiny shapes : too small and squat to be men : and yet , somehow , they might have been men . The landscape now grew strangely calm and idyllic . But this very calm struck us like a vision in a nightmare . The very grandeur was like a threat . The sweep and majesty of light on the hills , the flicker of light among the boughs , the dazzling artifice of light among the ferns and mosses  --  it all began to look a bit macabre . Nimbalimba climbed a tree when we reached the top of theP155hill . It was a towering palm : we could see him clinging to the top , like a dark fruit . " What do you see ? " called Abuluru , the bald one . " Nothing , " called Nimbalimba . " Just a valley and rocks .. . And an anthill . " " You 're sure it 's an anthill ? " " I am sure . . . . Now I see something moving . " " Look closely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And a wild boar drinking . " " What else , Nimbalimba ? " " Wait . . . . Something moving behind the rocks . " " Climb a little higher , Nimbalimba . Look again . " " Yes , " called Nimbalimba excitedly . " There is a hut . . . . At the edge of the stream . " And now once more it grew darker . Slowly we crept through the noiseless valley . It was a small deserted cabin ; a single window , a door , a chimney . It was sunk in dilapidation , saturated in stillness ; but a tense , gesticulating stillness which hung breathlessly in the leaves . It was like a voice , a strangled cry . Marius kicked at the door . It gasped and crumbled to dust . The light shot into the room like a dagger . It was filled with the jungle . There was a rustling and fluttering . Two tiny birds shot past us , and an apple-green snake dove into the floor . Invisible creatures went scurrying through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevice . They hung like stalactites from the roof , cast long tendrils over the walls , coiled over the floor and wound through the mossy furniture . A canvas cot , stained and rotted , stood in the middle of the room . The sheets were still creased with the weight of a sleeper 's body . I raised the pillow ; there was a nest of small blue spiders . BesideP156the bed lay a wrinkled map , clotted with moisture ; it clung to my fingers as I touched it . It was a map of the Congo , marked with indecipherable names and numbers . A kerosene lamp , filled with moths , hung from a hook near the window . Two empty bottles , filled with ants , lay in a dusty corner . Several books lay scattered under the bed , warped and odorous with mold ; cheap yellowbackedvolumes  --  Pascal , Baudelaire . I picked up one of them : a swarm of tiny worms slid to the floor . I began to turn the pages ; they clung heavily together , and smelled of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrawl : " We think we are shutting in the light . What we are really shutting in is the darkness . " But what was strongest of all was the smell which permeated the room . A hint of camphor , a touch of ammonia ; and something else too , a scent of anguish , a piercing whiff of some extremityof the mind . And then , as we walked out again toward the light and the air , I picked up the handkerchief from the floor . It had stiffened , the blood had turned a deep green . In one corner two gothic initials were embroidered in black : L.S.We sat in a circle around the dying fire , whispering , speculating . One by one the Negroes rose and pissed into the steaming embers . Then , one by one , they dropped off to sleep . Ndjoluva lay with his huge head in Bambo 's lap . Balibobotee had crept among the trees , followed by Momboola . Nimbalimba had rolled into a ball . Only Oudange still sat on his haunches , massive and taciturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking of , Alessandro ? " said Joshua , peering mistily through his heavy glasses . Alessandro blinked , and raised his enervated brows . " I was thinking of Venice , " he said in a feeble voice . " Of the sea . And the towers . And the music from the cafes ... "  | " And what about you , Marius ? " Marius grumbled ; he looked sullen and contemptuous . The scar on his face looked sharp and blue , like a tattooed hatchet . " I was thinking of nothing at all . Of a glass of cognac , if you wish , and a game of chess , down in the Rue du Bac .... " Joshua turned to me : " And you ? " he said shyly , in his naive persistent way . " What were you thinking ? " " I was thinking of a man , " I said . " A dying man . Coughing blood . And reading Baudelaire in the middle of Africa . . . " " And you , Shela ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of a girl , " she said , with a touch of menace . " A dead girl . With a golden bracelet on her wrist .... " She rose and stood still for a moment , facing the firelight , like a dancer on the stage . She seemed suddenly to flower : she stared at the flames and smiled , with a kind of sly , voluptuous amusement . She looked wonderfully stately , with her tiny waist and flowing hips . Then she turned her head slowly : her neck was long and slender , her head was narrow , sharp and serpentine . She cast a piercing look at Marius . Then she turned and vanished among the trees . None of us spoke . The magnetism of her body was hovering over us . The rhythm of her voice seemed to linger among the firelit branches . Darkness ; torpor . Everything was sinking in the flood of the night . Trees and hills ; personalities and passions . Everything was swallowed , engulfed in this dark unanimity . Everything we did was in harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed only fragments of some vast migrating current . I watched their faces by the dying firelight . They 'd all fallen asleep . I felt uncannily close to them ; closer than ever before , andp158than they 'd ever know . I felt like a diver at the bottom of the sea , exploring a new and spectacular landscape . Their thoughts , as they slept , moved like luminous fish through the waters . I saw them stirring all around me ; I felt the flickering of their fins . But when I tried to snatch at them they darted away , quick as light . I looked at Bambo and Ndjoluva , and weird old Abuluru ; at Koloke and Osseladossa and in the distance , Oudange . They were absolutely black , like the night itself . Their teeth and eyes  --  even these had vanished . They had merged with the hues of nature , with the essence of earth and of jungle ; they looked inhuman . And the others , close beside me , looked white , evanescent . Their pale Caucasian skin looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marius , the animal ; Joshua , the idealist ; and Alessandro , the artist . Each of them already touched , faintly mutilated by the claws of the jungle . In Alessandro 's sleeping face I could see the gleam of isolation , the lines of a gathering desiccation . His eyelidslooked parched ; his lips were pressed together . Marius looked shaggy , leonine . his face looked heavy and hungry , great matted curls fell over his forehead and temples . His lips were parted in a kind of snarl . And in Joshua too there were signs of a struggle . He looked like a child in the clutch of a nightmare . He was panting ; his brow was wet ; his lips were moving uneasily . There they lay , plunged in the African blackness . The lost Utopian ; the exhausted humanist ; the self-destroying nihilist . Each struggling toward his own ephemeral vision . And each suffering his own blind , galvanizing pang . And near by , at the other end of the fire , lay the half-breed Shela ; neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt child of an ancient ambivalence , born with a demon that never left her . Then the firelight died . I saw nothing , heard nothing at all . I felt poised in the heart of the world . I felt my finger tips resting light as a feather on the pulse of some great prehistoric mammal . A warm , almost electrifying sense of propinquity seized me ; a sense of dark human origins , waiting to be exposed at thep159core . Almost , almost . But still not quite ; never quite . All I felt was this pulsating warmth , like the warmth of a great artery ; and then an uncontrollable rush of horror . Now the night began to fade , the darkness grew fragmentary . Pale strips of fog were drifting among the tree trunks . I saw Momboola stirring ; and near him , Nimbalimba . Was it the light which troubled them , which filtered into their dreams ? Or something else ? It was almost cool now . A damp gray web lay over the grass . The fire was dead ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaking the dawn into splinters , came the sound of a gun . The Negroes sprang to their feet ; and all except Oudange scattered like a herd of deer among the trees . Oudange stood still and listened , sniffing the air , like an old stag . We waited ; but there was nothing more . One by one the men crept back toward the clearing , clinging instinctively to the spots of shadow . " Come , " said Oudange calmly , with a hint of mockery . " The night is over . There are no ghosts now . Only men . " He glanced at me with an apologetic air . " Yes , this is bad country , bwana . We call it Subalangala : the Hill Which Bites Like a Snake . " He gazed about him , counting the men , seizing each with a quick , deep look . Everyone was here . Everyone except Koloke . Then he said to Ndjoluva , with a kind of gentle melancholy : " Your gun is gone , Ndjoluva ? " Ndjoluva lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , hairless cheeks . P160At noon the jungle lies like a corpse ; utterly still ; only the flies keep buzzing . Everything lies absolutely immobilized , pinned down by the vertical rays of light . An hour passes . Nothing happens . There is only the rustle of the lizard , the spiraling fall of a leaf . Then , ever so slowly , another hour creeps by . Something begins to stir . An imperceptible clamor gathers . Suddenly , in midafternoon , the grasshoppers begin : a dry piercing note , like a splinter of heat . Then toward evening the various birds join in  --  the chirp and the caw , the trill and the warble . Then dusk : the frogs begin to bellow . The heron calls . The cricket starts chattering . And an apprehensive stirring begins in the deep of the wood  --  the tiny , invisible preludes to slaughter . Then the early night , with its elaborate ambush . And finally , after intervals of peculiar silence , when the whole forest seems suddenly paralyzed , comes the rush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roar of the lion , the long hysterical shriek of the lemur . All day we wandered on , saying nothing , merely listening . I could feel my hearing growing more and more acute ; I could feel my brain singling out each strand in that fabric of noises that hovered perpetually in the air ; those desperate little warnings and wailings , those grindings and whistlings , those infinitesimal squeals and protestations . P161Toward evening we passed through a manzanilla wood . Anthills , like tremendous tombstones , brittle as basalt , loomed in the shadows all around us . We stopped to watch them for a moment : the fighters with their enormous mandibles , the smooth and wingless , hollow-footed workers , the winged males waiting for the nuptial flight and the queen , huge , white and procreative . It was a miracle of equalitarian efficiency ; a society of monsters . The anthillslooked like miniature skyscrapers in some nightmarish projectionof the future . " They 've been watching us , " said Oudange cryptically . " They 've been following us . " Bambo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood leaning against the anthills , digging and sucking them out of their shells . They were ravenous : we were running short of supplies . And we were already two days behind our schedule . Nothing to worry about , precisely ; nothing had gone demonstrably wrong . ' What was it then that seemed oppressive ? Nothing that one could see , hear , touch , put into words . Something in our hearts . A sense of secret inadequacy ; or more properly , a sense of secret decay . Some shadowy impediment had arisen  --  within as well as without . That night I saw it in their faces . They were like fugitives in a dream , fleeing from some half-apprehended enemy but held back , weighed down , obstructed by some veiled manipulation of natural laws . " Who , Oudange ? " I asked quietly . " Who is it that 's following us ? " " They 're waiting to attack , " said Oudange grimly . " Who ? " I whispered . " Who is it , Oudange ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We built an improvised fortress for the night behind a deserted anthill , a wall of branches concealed by a drapery of twigs and vines . Here we crouched in silence , listening and waiting .   " How many are there , do you think ? " we asked . " Twenty perhaps , " said Oudange . " Or thirty . Or perhaps only two or three . " " Are they angry at us ? " we asked . " Oh , very angry , " muttered Oudange . " Because they think we brought the sickness ? " " No , no , " said Oudange huskily . " Because we refused to stay and join their tribes ? " " No , " said Oudange . " Nothing like that . " " Because Ndjoluva 's bullet killed the girl ? " Oudange shook his head and stroked his little hawk claws . " Well , why ? " I asked . " Do they want to rob us ? Or has theOracle warned them ? Do they think we are sorcerers ? " Oudange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bwana . And so we waited . Hour after hour , under the labyrinthical stillness of the night , we watched and waited . The sky was flooded with clouds which hung in the moonlight , fleeced with silver , inconceivably serene , wandering lazily toward the west like a flock of sheep heading homeward . The stars shone between them like the lights of distant farmhouses . The sky was so utterly calm , so idyllic and pastoral , I could almost hear the sound of bells and the bleating of lambs . But then when I looked down again and saw the shapes of the earth , the squat manzanilla trees and the futuristic anthills , the peacefulness vanished . Everything seemed to smolder . Nothing stirred , trees and anthills looked like beasts waiting to spring . The insects kept singing . The Negroes snored . Deep in the wood an owl was hooting . And the smell of a carcass near by  --  a wild boar , perhaps  --  grew vile and insistent . Once there was a distant rustle , like the sound of rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought ; I nudged Marius . We listened . But nothing happened . Presently the clouds vanished and the full moon poured downThe Ants 163P163on us . Shela rose from her hammock and drew both hands over her temples . " This heat , " she whispered . " Horrible . " I could feel the sudden leaping in Marius . He was staring at Shela with his small violent eyes : his lips parted , his pupils narrowed . Everyone was wide awake . Joshua lay staring at the sky  --  whisperingto himself , I thought . Alessandro was lighting a cigarette : his bony face flashed for an instant into brightness . Oudange sat on his haunches beside the guns . And beyond , outside our fortress , I could see the whites of Osseladossa 's eyes . Shela leaned over Alessandro . " A cigarette , " she whispered . As she sucked her light from his own their faces moved together , she placed her hand on his shoulder , her body swayed above his . She seemed to be rearing , hissing , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright in front of us , arms folded , flicking the ashes from her cigarette , like an actress in a melodrama . " Well , what are we waiting for ? " she said , rather theatrically . " What are we all afraid of ? Men ? Beasts ? Ghosts ? Does anyone know ? " She shrugged her shoulders and turned her back . She ran her palm over the nape of her neck . Then she turned her head and shot a fiery , undisguised look at Marius . Her eyes passed over the rest of us with a kind of cursory defiance , then she sauntered into the darkness , her head erect and dangerous , her broad hips gliding and weaving like a swimmer 's . Marius rose like an automaton , stiff and stultified ; he looked around with a vacuous leer ; then he followed her into the shadows . " Yes , " said Joshua quietly , after a moment . " What is it we 're afraid of ? Do you know ? Not men . Nor beasts . What on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , " I said absently . " Sambula , " he murmured , staring at me through the darkness . His mild gray eyes looked enormous , like those of a souba lemur . His look hung in the air , luminous and questioning , separated from his body by a sudden leap of yearning . " Listen , Sambula . Do you know why I 've really come ? I 'm beginning to realize , little by little . I thought I 'd come to collect some odd bits of nature . Beetles , moths , butterflies . Tiny hieroglyphics , you know , so to speak , which might yield some strange , wonderful lesson someday . Yes . That 's what I thought . But the lesson I 'm learning is odder than I expected . I 've always lived quietly , Sambula . Like one of my larvae in the cocoon . I 've lived in dark little rooms full of books , in dark little museums full of neatly labeled skeletons . I never realized that men existed . And now I 'm learning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay back . The white stars glittered . The night , the world , the spirit of man , all seemed wildly paradoxical ; being so unalterably what they were and yet their very opposite , so perpetually drawn to what was nearest and yet most remote , so continually split between what they naturally possessed and what they hopelessly lacked , so eternally disguised by their need to be precisely what they could never be , so enigmatically cursed by the yearning of what is pure in them for the impure , of what is creative in them for the suicidal , of what is angelic in them for the brutal . I could see it in all of us , like the mask of an incurable disease . I could see in Joshua 's puzzled , spectacled face a sensual ambiguity , a deep capacity for corruption ; just as in Marius 's dissolute egotism there was a frightening naivete ; and in Alessandro 's burning lucidity a tortured confusion ; and in Shela 's blind perversity a kind of bitter honesty , a fatally misdirected innocence . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we build our only possible salvation ; yes , and it 's our very strength , our imagination , our aspiration , our love , which pave the way for our most terrible defeats . P165Bambo crept through the morning mist and squatted beside me . His tattered shirt was dripping with dew ; he was shivering . " I have seen a leopard , " he whispered breathlessly . " Down by the stream I saw him , bwana . He stood in my path and looked at me gently . I thought he would spring at me , but he did n't spring . He lay down in front of me and waited . I did n't dare go forward . I did n't dare go backward . I was frightened , bwana . Kabisa ! I almost lay down and died ! There was blood on the leopard 's paws , and he began to lick the blood .... " I raised my head and looked at Bambo ; he was crouching beneath the anthill , absolutely frozen , staring through the trees with a crazy torpor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter , Bambo ? " He turned his head slowly . Something in his face appalled me . It radiated a kind of bestial magic . His hair looked thick and tawny in the early morning , his eyes were flaming , his tattooed little features looked incredibly swollen and masklike . A thrill of misery shot through me  --  something between horror and compassion . Momboola came running wild-eyed into our fortress , carrying a dew-drenched gun . He seized Oudange by the shoulder and cried to him in the Bantu dialect . The morning light poured through the leaves ; a sickly mustardhuedlight . The others turned , one by one , and wearily opened their eyes . Oudange nodded and stared at the gun . " What 's happened ? " moaned Joshua . " Koloke has been found , " said Oudange casually . " Momboola found him down by the stream . But nothing was left of poor old Koloke ; almost nothing . Only the bones and the hair and the little red loincloth . " " He 's dead ? " whispered Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with placidity . " He must have been sleeping . The leopard found him , and then , of course , after that . . . " He bowed to wipe the dew and the blood from the gun . P166We slept all afternoon in the edge of the wood . At nightfall we rose and entered the plain of Zougadi . This was the twenty-second day of our journey . And that night for the first time I came face to face with it . The real unutterable thing : the thing I 'd never dared to visualize . Death . My own death . ' the possibility , corrupt and glaring , of my own extinction . It was like swimming alone at night in a hot , shoreless sea . I felt abominably alone . Twelve men and a woman marching in a column through the Equator . No other trace of humanity . No trace of history even . It might for all we knew have been the wastes of Betelgeuse . Human feeling shriveled and expired like a drop of rain in a volcano . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken with a strange new chill . The light of the moon transformed their colors , their very shapes . They looked like figures on a stage , or in some vast old amphitheater ; so utterly pitiable , so intense in their hopelessceremony , so dreadful and lovable . There they were  --  stumbling , groping , coughing , limping , sighing ; so very alive and so very close to annihilation . I could reach out and touch them  --  Oudange with his bracelets glittering , Balibobotee with his hugep167shorts drooping like a naughty child 's , Nimbalimba with his little fez , and Bambo , like a pelican , with his pink shirt and scrawny legs ; the sulky Osseladossa with his great blue turban , and bald Abuluru , and the dandy Ndjoluva in his yellow loincloth , and ugly Momboola with his knives dangling about him ; and then Shela , like a shadow in her long spattered crimson ; and the three white men , clothed alike , their differences more hidden , more intricate than those of the blacks . Like figures in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a cloud covered the moon , and then they looked like a procession of the dead , on its way through the outer fringes of existence . And a moment later I saw them for what they were  --  neither a tapestry nor a symbol , but simply human fragments , odd , haphazard , hurled on this continentlike shells on a beach . A lunatic brightness covered the earth . I 'd never seen a night of such penetrating brilliance . The trees and bushes seemed laden with snow , and the hanging moss shone like a cavern of icicles . Once , as the path broadened into a clearing , Joshua raised his arm and whispered : " There . Look . Is that Nagala ? " We stared . But there was nothing at all ; only the endless flood of the plain . " There is nothing , " said Oudange carefully . " From here one can not see it . " But there was a queer little undertone in his voice . And for a moment it did seem , as I peered toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance , like a cloud of smoke . At that moment there was a delicate stirring behind us . ' We all heard it simultaneously : we all stood frozen . There was a certain intensity in that rustle , a tiny , ominous kind of pupose . All around us hovered the warm dark presence of an adversary . At that same moment , everything grew hazy . The moon dis-P168solved ; the light grew diffused . The earth was exuding a flood of mist . The porters faded suddenly like carp darting toward the bottom of a pond . Oudange beckoned and we crept behind him , quickly and intently . Bambo cried out in terror . " There ! " he shouted . " There , there ! " A long shape loped heavily through the fog ; I saw it dive past Momboola and then melt into the earth . Osseladossa ran up and raised his gun . " Wait , " cried Oudange . We stepped closer . There on the ground , snarling feebly through the wet pale air , lay a wounded leopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its belly . A maniacal green shone in its eyes . It lay without stirring , electrically coiled . It bared its teeth with a vicious deliberation , and a strangled sound crept forth  --  half hiss , half cough . It was dying ; even in death the flame of hatred was implacable . Osseladossa fired three times . " Kolokc 's leopard , " muttered Oudange as he leaned over the body . There was no time to strip the hide . On we went without a word ; deeper and deeper into the fog . It was like walking blindfolded . I kept reaching out to touch Momboola 's shoulder , for fear of losing him . Once Alessandro slipped and fell into a shallow pool of water ; his neck struck a rock and started to bleed . Once Joshua called ; he had lost his way in the milky distance . Once Marius roared with rage ; he had walked headlong into an anthill . Then the fog dissolved as suddenly as it had come . We found ourselves on a small plateau , tufted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsidian . Oudange looked around . " I do n't know this land , " he said in a low , rather reproachful voice . " ' We 're lost ? " growled Marius . " Yes . We 're lost , " said Oudange . We came to a halt . A shock of realization passed through me ; P169the land looked unimaginably lifeless . We stared strangely at one another . I saw a new expression in Marius 's face  --  a quick murderousflush . " Should we turn back ? " said Joshua slowly . " Turning back , " said Marius in a thick dry tone , " would be suicide . " " We 'll never get there , " muttered Alessandro . " Never . " " Yes , we 'll get there , " said Oudange ; " I promise you that we 'll get there , Assanda . " His eyes fell gently on Alessandro ; and a mysterious sadness fell on Alessandro , like a cloud . He looked away and said nothing more . And once again we followed Oudange through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moon seemed to penetrate the waste , to grind it into something shrill and homicidal . It was n't land we were crossing , it was some awful spiritual concoction , an embodiment of bitterness and pain , a scene of pure melancholia . It was then , that night  --  the night of the leopard  --  that I first felt a dangerous new numbness in my heart . As though the jungle had begun to seep into my arteries : only a twinge , only a glimpse  --  but it was enough . Everything changed after that night . The moments of beauty were more gripping  --  they were like desperate paeans of praise . And the moments of terror were deeper  --  they were like a hiss from the bottom of my soul . P170Soon after dawn we reached a deep , treeless estuary . Here we halted ; Alessandro was ready to collapse . The heat of the coming day was gathering ominously , crawling from the east like the sound of a faraway flood . We found a moss-walled cavern in the southem side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fell asleep without a word . I woke up toward noon . Balibobotee was cooking a large pot of rice . Plumes of smoke clung to the roof of the cave . Outside the golden brilliance of the day was seething . A crude little frieze had been carved on the rock behind Balibobotee ; a group of wild beasts , designed with a primitive zest and economy . Very old , no doubt ; immeasurably old . Layers of moss and lichen had softened the outlines . There was a dragon with a lion 's head pursuing a school of minnows : and in the corner a crocodile and a jackal , each devouring a small , slender fish . " What does it mean , Balibobotee ? " Balibobotee grinned sardonically . " Mean , Sambula ? Must everythingmean something ? Who knows what it means ? It 's very old , you know . The man who carved it died a thousand years ago . " Ile peered up at the carvings and shook his head slyly . " If you ask me , " said Abuluru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it 's a picture of the white man devouring the black . Times do n't change , Balibobotee ; evil is as old as the moon . Storms , plagues , droughts , the White Man ; they 've always existed . They 'll always exist . They 're stronger than we are , and there 's nothing to be done . " " But the White Man helps us too , " said Bambo , who 'd been listening gravely , dipping his finger in the pot . " He brings us medicines . He brings us gifts  --  new words , pretty colors . " " Yes , " said Abuluru gloomily . " Gifts . Medicines . New words . Pretty colors . And why ? Have you ever thought why ? " " Why , Abuluru ? " " To keep us in his power . All white men are sorcerers . There it is . I ca n't help it . It 's no fault of mine . Excuse me , Sambula ; but I 've seen you at it too , once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny that you are a sorcerer , please . And Jassa . Why do you suppose he catches all those moths ? And Assanda . Why does he pin our faces to bits of yellow paper ? And Marissa . Why does he pick up small stones and put them in bottles ? " " The White Man tries to teach us new things , " said Bambo meekly . " Yes . New Things , " growled Abuluru . " I am sick of New Things . Someday the world will explode with all these New Things . " I strolled out into the sunlight for a moment . It was like a blow on the head . I staggered . The sweat poured from me instantly . The familiar fever stirred in my brain : great zigzags shot across my vision  --  black , white , onyx-colored . I knelt among the rocks and was sick ; agonizingly sick . I crept back into the cave . It was like a watery labyrinth ; recess upon recess , vista upon vista of russet-hued stalactites with small blue grottoes hidden in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows . Drops of water fell rhythmically upon the stone . There was a wonderful coolness ; the first real coolness that I 'd found in Africa . An oblong hollow deep in the cave was filled with clear , sweetsmellingwater . It was exactly the shape and size of a bathtub . I lay down and idly splashed the water over my arms and forehead . A shadow stirred : I turned : yes , it was Shela . " Sambula , " she said languidly , with her forefinger on her cheek . " Why are you called Sambula ? " I explained why I was called Sambula . " You 're very dark , " she said , with a shameless glance . " Your face is n't much to look at , God knows . But you 're well built ; you 're husky . Was your father Portuguese ? Or Italian , perhaps ? " Neither , I said ; I was feeling a shade ill at ease . " You really do n't need to turn around like that , " remarked Shela . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see her maliciousnarrow eyes shining through the bluish light of the cave . " What are you afraid of ? " she whispered . " I wo n't bite you . I wo n't poison you . " She dipped her hands in the water and raised my face to her own . " I hate Marius , " she said suddenly , blowing the cigarette smoke through the ferns . " I despise Joshua . And I fear Alessandro . You 're the only one I trust . " " You hate Marius ? " I said carefully . She looked intently at the sky . " I wish he were dead . " Then she added : " But it 's you I 'm talking about . You 're a strange man , Sambula . Gentle . Aloof . Ever so patient . But inside you there 's something hard ; hard as granite . You 're unutterably selfish . You 're incapable of real passion . You really frighten me sometimes , Sambula . " " I 'm sorry , " I said apologetically .   " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she added cunningly . " Not at all . It 's just that you 're a little unreal . I see you , I hear you , I 'm touching you ; yes , you exist . But you 're like a salamander . You keep changing your color . You 're strong ; but you 're also very weak in a way . You 're clever , but you 're also blind . . . . Come , kiss me , Sambula . " Her body lay spread on the moss , like a shawl . Her arms were cast back , and her armpits sparkled like flames . The warm brown skin was powdered with flakes of sunlight . Her face , her whole body had unaccountably changed ; the half-closed eyes , the halfopenmouth , the legs half parted , the hands half folded , all flickeredwith an extraordinary sexual radiance . The arrowy pubic hair seemed to dart , like a serpent 's tongue . Her face had lost all trace of expression : it was a mask . The intensity of the eyes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core of her body , which gazed at me with a glittering slyness . She looked half dead and yet almost incandescent . She looked wildly desirable ; yet somehow alien , a bit repellent . ' We climbed back , a little later , through the estuary toward the cave . " You 're hiding something , " said Shela suddenly . " Tell me , my dear . What are you up to , really ? " A curious thought shot through my mind , like a needle : a magneticcontact had suddenly been established . " Have you ever , " I said blandly , " heard of a man named Leonard Speght ? " " Speght , " she murmured . The tone of her voice , the light in her eyes revealed nothing . We walked on silently . It was as though a deep stream were flowing between us . The feeling between us grew blurred ; it stealthily receded . Something treacherous had leapt from a dark corner of our being . Then she looked at me , quickly , astutely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathe me . " Speght ? Oh yes , I knew him . Slightly . Everybody knew him . By reputation , at least . What he was like inside , God only knows !   He was a scoundrel , " she said , with fury . " He had a spark of genius , but the Congo killed it . He turned into an unspeakable scoundrel . " " He was hated ? " I said . " Hated ? " She paused . " Not really , I think . " " Well , what was it about him that ... " " Yes ? " " That , well , disconcerted them ? " She looked weary , almost haggard . " Oh nothing , mind you , in him . He was human enough . A scoundrel , but human . Weak , in fact . Broken . Pitiable . But you see , down here people cease being men . Yes . Really . Sooner or later . I was the only one who saw through him . To the rest he became a legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all talked about him ; more and more as time went on . And the more they talked , of course , the less they understood him . He became a jungle deity . He became an Evil Spirit . " Her voice had grown soft and strangely passionate ; she drew her hand imperceptibly from mine . She stood alone in the rocky shadow ; feeble , miserable , diseased . " Look , " I said , " why did you finally let him ... " She stared furiously at the cliffs . " Yes ? " " Why did you let him go ? All alone ? Into that wilderness ? You must have known surely . . . " " Oh , I knew , " she cried . " Of course I knew ! I knew everything he did . I began to feed on misery and self-torture . I wanted him to die , finally . I could n't stand it . " " I sec , " I said gently . " Yes , " she said , throwing back her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I remember nothing , nothing at all . " A waterfall hung at the further end of the ravine . Motionless , absolutely frozen , it hung there , like a braid of crystal , flashing into life as it touched the pool , steaming and spuming among theP175pebbles . I was sitting with Joshua in the tawny torpor of the afternoon . " We 're off again , " I said , " in the morning . " Joshua nodded halfheartedly . " Alessandro 's better ? " I said , after a while . Joshua glanced at me uneasily . " I ca n't be sure . Perhaps . Perhaps . " " Have you noticed ? " I said quietly . " How they look at him ? How they avoid him ? Almost as though ... " Joshua raised his eyes ; he was watching the tireless effervescence , the leap and lunge of the waterfall . He took off his glasses and wiped the spray from the lenses . Then he said , unexpectedly : " Tell me , Sambula . Do you believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who knows , " I said , " what he really believes ? " " But you believe , " insisted Joshua , peering at me through his desperate myopia . " I can see that you believe ! " " Yes , I believe , " I said reluctantly . " I believe because I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid of this dazzling onrush of nature . I 'm afraid of all this hissing and bubbling and roaring  --  this interminable golden an-archy ! " " Then you believe , " he murmured , " in its power ? " " In its power to destroy , perhaps . But not in its omnipotence . Not in its finality . I believe in man . In the possibility of goodness and reason . In the chance , just the outside chance , perhaps , of salvation . I must believe in it . I must . If I believed in nothing but this glitter and chaos , I would give up , Joshua . I think I would die . " The sun passed for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was washed with light ; the leap of the spray was shot with amber . Life . Death . Salvation . Chaos . Yes , I thought ; but how incomparablyvaster , how infinitely deeper and darker it all really is . IIere we talk of God and anarchy , of goodness and reason ; at the soundP176of each word the reality shrivels . The human language , it seems , has a flavor of arsenic . The real passion and terror lurk where words never penetrate . God . Love . Yes , already there 's an obsolete ring about them . Everything 's changed . Our past has withered . Our whole framework has dissolved . We 're like children waking up to a strange new world , white and cold and appalling as an operating room . We 're learning the words for all those sparkling rows of instruments , but no words for the shadows stirring at the roots of the heart . We keep wondering why we live , why we suffer , why we love ; above all what we can do , if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose gods are still the visible terrors of their world ; lucky the ones who still have names for the invisible terrors of the soul ! We found Balibobotcc crouching beside the stream , dangling a worm at the end of a line . " What arc you doing , Balibobotee ? " " Fishing , " moaned Balibobotee . We squatted beside him and peered into the water . The evening light trembled on the pebbles below . Two large-headed fish with long , delicate whiskers were hovering in the shade , flicking their tails . " Are they good to eat ? " I whispered , pointing to the fish . Balibobotee smiled tolerantly . " No , no , my dear . They are not for eating . They are called kou'bhali ; the cobra fish . " " Then why are you fishing ? " " I like to fish , " sighed Balibobotee . " After all , " he went on , in musing tones , as Bambo and Abuluru came up and joined us , " life is really like a fish . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fine silver scales , but a soft white belly ; and round , greedy eyes ; and a hard , haughty tail . It slips and slides away , you can only catch it by cunning  --  with a net , or a hook . "  | " Well , " said Bambo wistfully , " I think life is more like a bird . It flutters over the hills and eats worms and insects . It has a long red beak , and is beautiful only from a distance . ' Hie bright blue feathers are full of vermin . " Abuluru was listening cynically . He had laundered his loincloth in the stream and laid it on a boulder to dry . " To me , " he grumbled , " life does n't look like a bird , or even a fish . To me it looks more like a hippopotamus . It means well but is clumsy . It looks big but is stupid . It eats much but is weary . It goes splashing in the mud . ' Why , " he demanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful feathers ? " We sat quietly for a while . It grew dark ; the kou'bhali vanished . Bambo kept muttering vaguely to himself , and Momboola , who had wandered up , was arranging some white pebbles in the shape of a star . " What on earth are you muttering , Bambo ? " said Momboola irritably . " I am making a poem , " said Bambo , with mysterious eyes . " A poem ? What kind of poem ? " " An American poem , " said Bambo haughtily . " But you 've never been in America , Bambo ! " " Well , " declared Bambo , " that 's why I 've made a poem about America . . . . Listen . " And he recited his poem , in lugubrious tones : " America comes at night like a bird with yellow eyes . America comes at dawn like a hill with a long nose . America comes at noon like a cloud with a big stomach . America comes at dusk like a waterfall with white hair . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird ! " Now it was night . Oudange had lit a fire near the mouth of the cave . We could see him leaning over the flames , puffing and blowing . The flames leapt ; the whole ravine swiftly receded as the ruddyP178highlights began to play among the boulders . A horde of zebrastripedmoths fluttered in and out of the light . Osseladossa was crouching beside Oudange , pointing his feet toward the fire , then digging between his toes with a knife , extracting the heat-dazed parasites . Far down the ravine I saw a shadow trotting to and fro with a strange liquid rhythm . The eyes shone dimly ; a hyena , perhaps . The fever was upon me . I crept through the stifling darkness of the cave and groped my way toward the stars above the estuary . The cliff rose vertical against the sky , monumentally phallic , an epitome of the African obsession . The stars lay scattered among the bamboos like tiny fireflies . Far away shone the waterfall : the light fell on it oddly , the spiraling waters seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound far off ; too high for an owl , too shrill for a heron . Then silence ; and then a voice , close by and familiar . I could sec their silhouettes stirring faintly among the rocks . He raised his head and turned . But she swiftly drew him down again ; she seemed to devour , to envelop , engulf him . I could hear the brief , violent shudder of his body ; and then a stifled moan as he buried his face in her belly . Then he subsided and they lay silently , arm in arm , facing the sky . " Come , " she whispered . " Kiss me , Marius . " His shoulders rose ; he seemed to be gripping her by the throat . " You whore , " he muttered . " You miserable whore . " She gasped with pain . " No , no , " she cried softly ; and he sank back again with his head on her shoulder . " You 'd like to kill me , " she whispered . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the cliff . I was shivering with the chill of fever . It was like standing on tiptoe , poised like a dancer on thep179brink of motion , clad in vapors , free of time , free of space , freed of guilt . There was a penetrating beauty in this sensation , a heighteningof isolation which bordered on music . Horror there was none ; nor any sense of defeat or extinction . Just this perilously delicate equilibrium , complete in itself . And suddenly it seemed that sleep , search , love , life itself , were no longer in the least essential . I 'd found at last , in this intoxicating freedom which flowed through the night , a fulfillment of all desire , both the dreamed-of and undreamed . The breath from the ravine passed over my face . A star hung twinkling above the monolith , like a great spermatozoon . A flawless certitude passed through my senses . Everything grew clear . I understood ; I knew . And then I felt myself falling , drifting to the ground like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet me . The next morning Bambo found me sleeping on the edge of the cliff . My right shoulder was swollen and bruised , but that was all . It was growing light . The fever was gone . A herd of shadows was prowling along the estuary . " Look , " said Bambo , kneeling among the rocks . It was merely another rock , I thought ; heavily dented , cylindrical . Then I recognized the features , stained with a lichenous patina  --  the rows of rings on the neck , the huge umbilicus , the breasts like little cones and the mutilated genitals : half man and half woman , with an adumbration of the beast . But the head was really what struck me  --  hairless and hydrocephalic , with eyes blank yet fanatical , a gorilla nose , fat carplike lips . It stared through the shadows , through the rocks and gravel , through Bambo and me and all palpable substance . The roots had bored , the weather had split , the spiders had nested , the sun had bleached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecipherable but electrifying . We crawled along the edge of the cliff . The air was now glori-P18o ously clear . Far , far the land extended , far the heave and swell of the shadows , unimaginably far the great currents of foliage . It was a new note of music ; a chord freshly struck ; one more gigantic nuance of the continent . " There it is , " whispered Bambo , and touched me lightly on theshoulder . " Je , je . There it is .... " I turned . Bambo 's eyes were deep and grave , his lips were parted ; he was trembling a little . There , infinitely remote , like a pebble lost in the tides of the jungle , rose a thimble-shaped hill ; or perhaps only a denser pyramid of haze . " Nagala ? " I said . " Nagala , " said Bambo , murmuring the word as though it were a call or a song , or an abracadabra . It was the first time I 'd heard one of the natives utter the name ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but like an incantation . A moment later it was gone . I heard the note of awe , of incredulityin Bambo 's voice still echoing faintly . I stared : but some effect of the light , some modulation of atmosphere had intervened . Nagala had vanished . I kept staring ; but there was nothing . " Come , " said Bambo gently , taking my hand . " Let Jassa heal your shoulder . And then we start for Boom'gahala . " P181In Boom'gahala everyone looked desperately bored . They barely turned their eyes as we passed ; huge imbecilic eyes set deep in faces of a nerveless loveliness . The women looked like huntresses , the men like mighty warriors . Their bodies were lean and long and tigerish , but their eyes were the eyes of cocaine addicts . All of Boom'gahala seemed to be recovering from a fabulous week end . " Well , " said Balibobotee crisply , " they 're lazy this month . " " And next month ? " I inquired . " Next month , " Balibobotee confessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do they ever work , Balibobotee ? " " No . Not really , Sambula . " " Do n't they hunt ? Do n't they fish ? " " Well , not much , " said Balibobotee demurely . " They steal . That is their profession . Boom'gahala is famous for its thieves . They are the cleverest thieves in Africa . " I grew thoughtful ; then I said : " Perhaps we 'd better be careful . " " Oh no , " said Balibobotee lightly ; " this is not their stealing season . They are resting , as you see . But two months from now ... , Three surly young warriors came wandering up . They wanted medical treatment ; one for a carbuncle on his neck , one for some boils which were festering under his tight-fitting bracelets , and the third , a stocky , bull-necked fellow , for lovesickness . " Lovesickness ? " said Joshua . The warrior nodded shyly . He had been suffering considerable pain . He had been in a state of continual erection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both indecorous and impractical , quite aside from the pain . Joshua gave him some white powders  --  soda , possibly , or saltpeter  --  and treated the wounds of the two other patients . A bevy of tiny old men  --  fifteen or twenty of them  --  now crept up shamefacedly . They too wanted treatment . What for ? They explained , with much ceremony and circumlocution . " This we do n't mind , " they said sadly , pointing to their withered arms ; " nor this , " and they pointed to the white hairs dangling from their nipples ; " nor even this , " and they pointed to their missing teeth . " But this ! " They sighed despondently as they pointed to their shrunken loins . Their complaint was , in short , precisely the oppositeof the young warrior 's . Did we have some other kind of powder , perhaps ? A black powder ? A red powder ? Joshua shook his head . Balibobotee turned to them with severity . " We all grow old , " he informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable to be old , he added sententiously , and be removed from the clutches of pusillanimity and desire . They listened halfheartedly , then crept away again , rather guiltily . Finally the medicine man of Boom'gahala appeared . He came to demand some chickens on behalf of the village . We explained that we had no chickens . Well , he suggested , a sheep might do . We had no sheep , we said wearily . He looked shocked and indignant . He was laden with fetishes , even more than was customary : a python 's head , a buffalo 's jaw , a cock 's comb , a leopard 's claw , a lizard 's tail , a giraffe 's ear , and a crocodile 's tongue . " You do n't even have a goat ? " he demanded . " Not even a goat , " we replied . " ' Well , we are all , " he said crossly , " like little seeds cast loose byP183the winds . We are like petals torn from the stalk . We are like hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trout . Out of the wilderness we come . Into the wilderness we shall return . Some kind of calamity will surely fall on you ; you must leave Boom ' - gahala at once ! " That evening we camped in a great golden meadow surrounded by a twisted mass of palmetto . This was our twenty-fourth day . Alessandrolooked horrifyingly weak ; two sores on his thigh had refused to heal , the infection had spread , he was panting with fever . Joshua gave him the usual quinine and aspirin and sprinkled sulfa crystals into the wounds . Oudange shook his head and scratched his armpitsportentously . " There 's a path due west , " he presently observed , " to Fort Philippe . Assanda and the lady could reach Fort Philippe in three days . In Fort Philippe they could rest . I could find a guide in Boom'gahala . Assanda and the lady are ill : much too ill for Nagala ! " Alessandro shook his head . " I 'm staying with you , " he muttered . " Oudange is right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Marius stared at him and said : " Go to Fort Philippe , Ales-sandro . " Alessandro was lying in the hammock , which Momboola had slung between two tamarisks . The rest of us were squatting on an enormous fallen trunk  --  dark and lustrous as ebony , and engraved by decades of termites in exquisite serpentine patterns . A filmy languor hung in the air ; even Oudange looked querulous and listless . " I have no interest in Fort Philippe , " said Alessandro wearily ; his eyes were burning like small red flames in the evening light . His voice trembled . His face had altered incredibly ; his hair had sud- denly thinned and he seemed almost bald . The whole effect of his head was of a skull-like fanaticism . I could smell the coppery scent of rot in his body . " You understand , do n't you ? " I said gently , taking his hand in mine : it was hot and dry . " You ca n't go on like this , Alessandro . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Marius , and Marius gravely returned his look . A deep and intricate feeling shone through that mutual gaze , an ancient idealism , a flicker of love : and a flicker of hate as well . Or something akin to hate  --  a kind of guilt perhaps ; something stranger and deeper than jealousy . There was a touch of poison in that long incomprehensible gaze . I found Shela alone in the tent . There was a glitter of violence in her eyes . Her own little madness was rising to a crisis . The negroid strain had taken possession , as it were ; a flavor of superstitionand strategy hung about her . She really looked like a witch , with her piercing eyes and sinuous features and her long , rich , ravenous body . " Sit down , Sambula , " she whispered hoarsely . " Come . Be frank with me . What 's going to happen ? " I shook my head . " God knows . I do n't understand these people . " " Which people ? " She muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . She smiled cunningly . " It 's you , " she said slowly , " who 've gone mad , my dear . " " Well , perhaps , " I said . It was dark , but the firelight cast a nervous triangle across Shela 's body . A hot dull wind had risen ; sparks were flying through the air . One had lit on the tent and burned a round black wound in the canvas .   " I 've been watching you , " she said , staring dreamily at the roof of the tent . The air was thick with the smell of smoke and moldy canvas , and the scent of mangoes cast forth by Shela 's body . She was shining with heat . I felt suddenly drawn to her ; drawn as to something alien and evil , perversely drawn , mystified , a bit intoxicated . " I 've been watching all of you , " she said wearily . " You 're mad , all four of you . You 're frantically digging your way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through pestilenceand fever . And why ? Why , for God 's sake ? To reach a ridiculouslittle hill . It 's like looking for the perfect lover , dear Sambula ; you 'll never reach it . It 's like looking for a god ; do n't you know that God comes only to those who never look for Him ? And worst of all , it 's like looking for death . Underneath all that mystery , that morbid craving , what is there really ? You 're frightened of life . You think you 're looking for reality . But you 're really looking for the great , the final escape ! " It was a curious moment . She suddenly cast off her heavy lassitude , her smoldering contempt ; she looked at me with a yearning tenderness . The human soul at certain moments seems actually to unfurl ; the masquerade falls off like dead bark from a tree . She was no longer vengeful , calculating , possessed ; she was merely desperatelytired and lonely . She caught my glance . Her eyes grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sambula , " she whispered . " Make love to me . I need it . Dreadfully . " I leaned over her and she drew my head to her breast . I kissed her ; but it was no use . The moment was gone . The desire had fled , as swiftly and unaccountably as it had come . Pity had killed it ; and of course distrust . I now felt only a kind of dread . Iler beauty had withered in less than three days , it was gone utterly , without a trace . The sullen brilliance , the tension , the flamboyance had vanished . She looked at me helplessly . " Yes . I know , " she said . " I know . It 's over . " Her face was pinched and twisted , like that of a child on the brink of tears . " It 's all over , " she whispered , and closed her eyes and turned away . I woke up and found a strange warm light filling the morning . Nimbalimba woke up at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We rose and listened : there was a crackling noise in the east , like the rattle of distant gunfire . We crossed the glade and looked into the deep dry valley . A swampy brightness was creeping over the horizon , but the darkness of the night still covered the valley . And through the darkness shone a flickering stream ; a ruby-tasseled onrush of flames . A breeze had arisen : the woods were on fire . The slopes beyond rose black and lifeless  --  burned into charcoal , wholly devoured . The sky was rapidly growing lighter . Great plumes of smoke were unfurlingover the valley . Jets of flame leapt quixotically through the mist . Oudange came running up behind us , followed by Marius and Momboola . The distant leap of the fire was reflected on their eyes . " Quick , quick , " shouted Momboola . The oily elephant grass below us was exploding like a string of firecrackers . A wall of black smoke rose into the air . Flames shot over the ground like horizontal streaks of lightning . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor issuing from the blackened slopes . Eddies of heat swirled about in the fluted light , and as the wind abruptly shifted the flames shot forth with a roar . Sparks were rocketing and cascading through the sky . Then the sun was eclipsed . The pillars of smoke grew tall and opaque . Now we felt it : our eyes were blurred and smarting , the heat came lunging at us in great thick spasms . For an instant Nagala hung transfixed in the distance  --  it exhaled a volcanic radiance , trembled , glittered , collapsed : and then it was hidden by clouds of smoke . P187The Negroes were rushing about with burning stalks : they set fire to the dry palmettos and slowly drove it eastward , beating out the flames to the west . We cut large whips from the shrubbery and ran to and fro , killing sparks , crushing the wayward strips of flame . The billowing smoke began to choke us ; our hands and feet were painfully scorched . Clouds of tiny embers , like fireflies , lit on our skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were driving swiftly toward each other , leaping and exultant , like armies marching to battle . The flames rippled across the hillside , the saplings burst into bloom . Everythingdarted and danced . The Negroes called through the smoke , coughing and shrieking with excitement , flourishing their torches like banners , driving the line of flame to the east . Momboola 's hair caught fire and he flung himself to the ground , grinding his head in the thick black dust . The colonnades of fire drew closer and closer . The aisle between them was swiftly narrowing , and shafts of air sprang up like geysers , scattering about great showers of sparks . And suddenly , miraculously , the whole place grew winged . Wings were filling that narrowingoasis of green  --  a great frenzy of wings , large and small , smooth and crested , blue and scarlet and emerald . Thousands of parrots there were , driven forth by the flames , driven from copse to copse , too weak or too stupid to climb over the fire : they clung exhausted to the boughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palmettos , the lianas , the rocks , their eyes wild and rubylike with the enveloping firelight , their wings already limp with the recognition of death . Hovering feebly among the boughs , suffocating and singed : their glorious colors seemed to turn into flames : their plumage flashed in a final tawdry magnificence . And then , at a hidden signal , they all began to cry ; a cry such as I 'd never heard in my life , a hoarse and agonizing cackle , an earsplitting crescendo that pierced the roar of the flames like an arrow . We could see the armies of fire shuddering as they almost met , raising their spears , casting forth streamers of gold and chrysanthemums of smoke . We heard cries in the distance ; a herd of gazelles was leaping through the haze , darting chaotically back and forth in the intolerable heat . Some of them , insane with terror , dove straight into the flames ; then the whole flock turned and shot toward a corridor to the left . We saw them floating over the charred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be flying rather than leaping , like a horde of giant locusts . They were followed by other shapes , veiled , distorted by the smoke : panicky monkeys darting from bush to bush , a few light-blinded lemurs , a jackal or two , all fleeing from the tightening cul-de-sac of fire . Then the two battalions met . A spectacular fusillade filled the air , a great explosion of embers like fountains boiling through the smoke . They embraced one another , intertwined , interpenetrated . The flames lost direction , they spiraled about in a kind of internecinefury . They began to subside , little by little ; so it seemed . But the energy of the fire was still implacable . The flames shot sideward with a concerted intensity , they gathered speed and swung around in a vicious semicircle . They sprang to strike at us from behind ; we saw nothing but bayonets of flame all around us . An asphyxiating aura swept over the meadow . A glitter of calculation hung over the flames ; they rose higher and higher , gathering a frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a rattling as of machine guns as a clump of bamboos burst into smoke . And then abruptly , inexplicably , the whole drama collapsed ; the flames crumpled , the smoke grew tenuous , and the sparks fell listlessly to the ground . The roar faded away , only a long low hissing filled the valley . As we turned back to the clearing Balibobotee came running up . His eyes were sparkling with rage . " She 's gone , " he cried . " She 's gone ! " We looked into the tent . Yes , she was gone ; gone for good . And so , we discovered , was Abuluru . And so was a large unopened sack of provisions ; the most precious of all , filled with coffee and choco-P189late . And gone , likewise , was our only compass , and one of our two remaining guns . We peered through the trees . There was nothing , not a trace . We listened : far away we could hear a crackling sound , like thousandsof infinitesimal hands applauding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream  --  wounded gazelles , perhaps , or lemurs lost in the daylight . P190We entered a new dark soporific air . Tall bluish trees , resembling eucalyptus but darker , rose interminably through the morning stillness . A scent of curry clung to the air . This , said Oudange , was the notorious fetishist country we were approaching ; Kalagouma , the land of prophets and clairvoyants . And beyond a doubt there was something rather odd in the atmosphere ; we all grew aware of it . Time collapsed , like a telescope . Past and future seemed in some inexplicable manner to blend . Glancing into the future was like a subtle stirring of memory : and recollections took on an air of prophecy , of speculation . Momboola tried to plead with us to avoid the Kalagouma and go westward , over the unhaunted savannahs ; he was afraid of the crippling powers of the Kalagouma . " My friend Malongo once entered here , " he said morosely , " and he came back with a voice like a girl 's . Bangouala once entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moola Mutandi entered and developed a snout , like a tapir 's . Let us go , " he pleaded gently , " through the savannahs , bwana ! " But we could n't , argued Oudange : the loss of time would be fatal . And so we followed him deeper into the sunless wood . The whole place , we found , was swarming with lemurs ; they felt atP191home in the clean , spicy darkness . They made their nests in the tall black trees and abhorred the sun . We saw them leaping from limb to limb without the slightest sound . Their white markings and yellow eyes shone through the leaves and vanished . Oudange told us all about them . The commonest type he called the potto : the potto had reddish fur , a stumpy tail , and an extraordinarilyjovial , inquisitive face . He spent his time eating small black nuts , and playfully dropped the shells on our heads as we passed . Another lemur was called the groo-loo ; he spent most of his time in a sort of daydream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groo-loo was a sad , neurotic little beast ; he began to weep like a child when we passed underneath . A third kind was the souba , a tiny brown creature three inches long , who clung to the bark like a squirrel , hissing at us vituperatively . A fourth kind was the ayeaye : aye-aye meant " oh , look , " said Oudange , and he was overjoyed when we finally caught sight of an aye-aye , busily digging grubs among the branches . This was the prettiest of the lemurs , black as sable , with a tremendous bushy tail , hands as delicate as a violinist 's , and strangely luminous , worried eyes . " Only lemurs live here ? " I asked . " In this particular forest ? " " Yes , only the lemurs , " said Oudange . " The other animals are afraid . Even the leopard . The lemurs , you see , are ghosts : lemur means ghost in the Bantu dialect . And the lemur casts a spell on other animals . He makes them sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . Whenever an animal dies willingly we know that a lemur has bewitched it . " I asked whether the lemur has a power over men as well . Only the aye-aye , said Oudange ; the aye-aye brings happiness . When a man has been touched by the aye-aye he can consider himself lucky . It prolongs his life , for one thing . And for another , he grows irresistible to the ladies ; his neck grows thicker , his thumb grows broader , his loins grow powerful , his chest begins to swell . But the aye-aye , unfortunately , was very rare : rare and next to impossible to capture . Many men had spent years trying vainly to capture the aye-aye . And in any case , said Oudange , it was highly unlikely that a captured aye-aye would care to exercise his beneficentmagic . We arrived in Popokura , as it happened , just in time to witness the annual circumcisions . Popokura , we were told , though less elegant than Yalemba , had a great reputation for oligarchical refinements . The chieftain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded and we presented him with the usual salt and beads and buttons , as well as a long silver knife . Finally he consented . We hid among the shrubs ; it was important that the boys themselves should n't catch sight of us . Presently the boys , the chosen neophytes , appeared on the scene , marching in a column to a rapid beating of tambourines . They were all in their early teens , and had just spent a whole year of acute mortification in the open brush , unseen by their fellow villagersand , most particularly , by their mothers . During this period they walked on all fours like a beast , and suffered flagellation at the hands of a protector , crouching on their knees under the protector'slegs while he beat them with a rod on the buttocks , teaching them bit by bit the essential meaning of Good and Evil . And during this year in the wilderness they likewise learned the art of poison and inoculation , special therapeutic dances , and an esoteric language , with the result that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorpion , even of ants and bees ; and a gradual chemical alteration in their blood made them unappetizing to the great cats . In short they had nothing to fear from the jungle ; or almost nothing . They wore straw masks rising to two tall horns and ballet-like skirts of rigid straw . Everything was painted white  --  the omnipotent , longed-for color : masks , skirt , hair and skin . The medicineP193man himself wore nothing but a shabby loincloth . The music grew subdued , the medicine man spun around in a circle , waving the great ceremonial knife to and fro . Then the protectors advanced , each leading his disciple . The villagers of Popokura stood among the trunks , gesticulating and humming . One by one the candidates were led to the center , stripped of their masks and horns and skirts and simultaneously of their adolescent shame and guilt , while the medicine man with a proficient flick of the knife carved away the foreskin and sprinkled the bleeding member with blue powder . And then , one by one , still bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millet beer from a bowl , and triumphantly called attention to the various symptoms of their completed puberty . The sound of trumpets emerged from the wood , imitating the call of wild beasts during the rutting season . And shortly the macabre ballet began , degenerating by degrees into the usual drunken orgy . Finally we crept away , when no one was looking , and made our way through the trampled outskirts of Popokura . The moon had n't risen yet . But the humid night air caught and disseminated the brilliance of the starlight . Nothing stirred , the shrubs looked pale and petrified as statues . But there it was ; I felt it ; the disturbance for which no word quite exists , neither anxiety nor conscience , neither guilt nor premonition ; that sudden chill that comes from knowing that the brutality of the world is close at hand . The terror grew . Its source , its nature remained obscure . But there it was , unmistakable ; clear as the stars piercing the foliage . Then I saw something moving . A deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noiseless as a shadow ; a panther , possibly ? " Be calm , " I said to myself . " Do n't move . Perhapsit 's nothing ; a trick of the fancy . " I closed my eyes for an instant , then opened them again . The shape was still there , but closer ; unmistakably closer . Now I could hear it breathing , it seemed to sigh with yearning . Then it paused . And now I smelled it : the faint scent of carbon which issues from a man stricken with panic . I slid from the hammock , darted sideways , and lit on him from behind . But his skin was like that of an eel ; it slipped from under me . I felt myself hurled head first to the ground , heard a faint grinding in the nape of my neck and felt an atrocious pain flow down my spine . For a moment I lay stunned . Then I felt his legs tighten around my abdomen , squeezing my breath away . The stars were spinning in a fiery whirlpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scream ; impossible . I felt nauseated . I began to vomit ; but my throat remained locked . In a final thrust of desperation I pressed my face against his neck and bit ; I felt the tendon hardeningand the blood spurting across my lips . I felt his legs still tightening and began to lose consciousness . My eyes closed , it seemed that I was floating in a new , infinitely gentle ambience , rising and falling in the swell of the sea . Then I felt his grip lessening . He was sobbing and groaning . My strength returned with an almost mesmerized intensity , we both rose to our feet , I freed my right arm and flung it across his head , with the edge of my palm chopping at his neck like a knife . He fell : luck was with me . He fell like a broken bough . He lay on his back gurgling helplessly , and as I leaned over him I saw the look of childlike anguish , the deep bewildered misery in his face . " Momboola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone mad . " He looked up at me in a peculiar way : hatred , defeat , fulfillment , tenderness , disgust  --  impossible to tell which it was . But I was beginning to understand . " What have I done to you , Momboola ? " " No , no , " he whispered hoarsely . " It was n't you . It was n't you . " " Who was it then ? " " Not you , Sambula , " he whispered ; tears were rolling down hisP195face , tears of pain , of humiliation . I could taste the blood on my tongue ; I could feel the thick warm blood on my knuckles . " Well , who was it ? " I said softly . " Was it .. He nodded before I spoke the name . " Why did you want to kill him ? Why do you hate him ? Why are you afraid of him , Momboola ? " Momboola closed his eyes . " He will kill us all , " he moaned , pressing his face to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magabwa . He will kill us all .... " I lay down again in my hammock and tried to fall asleep . But I could n't . My brain was spinning like a gyroscope , conjuring forth image upon image ; the lemurs glaring from the boughs , the neophytesdancing , the incomprehensible frenzy and lamentation of Momboola . How can one ever explain , in this shadowy land where time does n't exist , where the individual soul scarcely exists , where hope and logic are out of the question , the real nature of evil ? Here evil was a thing everlasting and inexorable , leaking continually from the mind like resin from a tree ; a force that took on an absolute reality , like sunlight , sickness , crocodiles , death . Sin as a purely human effluence was unimagined , the only pain was earthly , evil was animisticand all-enveloping , the human became fused with the inhuman , and all things were touched with the hopeless antiquity of guilt . And in a way , Africa was not really a climate in the normal sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distillation , a vision . Here reason and science fell away like a chrysalis , were discarded as purely ephemeral secretions of the human brain , which is rooted in prehistory , which draws its wisdom from a bottomless well of suffering , which is freed from tangible chains , which is first and forevera thing of the spirit ; which has , after all these millennia of slaughter , no lasting faith in an eventual earthly paradise , but , unlikeall other animals , fixes its gaze on the supernatural ; which sees in all things an oracular layer of meaning , a monstrous ambivalence , an inexhaustible wealth of symbols , so that at last the line between fact and imagination dissolves ; which compensates for the terrors of death with an inherited vision of a superlife , derived from a struggle without beginning or end , from an infinite and terrible accumulation of memories . This , says Africa , is the nature of man ; this is his only real salvation . P197At noon we came upon a group of musicians playing tipsily under a banyan tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine mosaic ; he played a tiny two-stringed lyre . Another was draped in cockatoo feathers . He played a perforated horn , which sounded like the croaking of frogs . The third wore nothing but two rather dowdy elephant 's ears , and played a towering triple drum . A wedding had just taken place in Kanda-kanda . The palms were laden with flowers , and a flavor of dying festivity hung in the atmosphere . The wedding guests lolled about in the shade . " They are waiting , " said Balibobotee , " for the wedding embrace . " I looked puzzled , no doubt . Among the Lamba-Djunge , he observed , the initial wedding embrace was always performed in the presence of the entire tribe . A white sheet was laid in the middle of a field . Men , women and children all gathered solemnly . The little bride was brought out by the other women of the family  --  by the aunts , preferably  --  and lay down on the sheet with her eyes blindfolded , while the oldest of the aunts sprinkled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a great crescendo of drums . He was allowed , if he felt a bit shy , to wear a mask . He did an introductory dance , calculated to bring his passions to a suitable pitch . The embrace , carefully rehearsed on both sides and highly ritualistic , was then performed ; accompanied by grunts from the impassioned groom , little squeals from the bride , and delicate expressions of alarm and approval from the audience . " The Lamba-Djunge , " Balibobotee concluded primly , " are very modest , you see . " " Modest ? " I said , a little skeptically . " Oh yes , " said Balibobotee . " The girls of the Lamba-Djunge remain pure until their wedding day . This is a very unusual custom in the Congo , one might say . But among the Lamba-Djunge fornication is distinctly frowned on . Yes . Really . It is considered improper . And so the whole tribe watches the wedding embrace , to make absolutely sure that the bride is a virgin . " " Can they really be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Balibobotee . " And there is blood on the sheet . The aunts rush up and triumphantly wave the bloodstained sheet in the air . The women nod and smile . The men clap their hands . The children begin to sing and throw oleander blossoms . It is all very dignified , among the LambaDjunge . Very respectable . " Later in the day , he added , the groom would pierce the lips of his bride with a knife and insert a small wooden peg , which would gradually be widened as she grew older . We watched a group of Lamba-Djunge women stroll past , stiffly , superciliously . They all wore immense wooden disks in both lips , almost as large as dinner plates . Their mouths looked like preposterousbeaks , and stirred with a clicking like castanets . It was quite impossible for them to speak : they merely moaned and bleated and chanted . Why did they wear these dreadful things ? " Oh , to appease the ancestral monster , " said Balibobotee , shrugging his soft brown shoulders . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , by a subtle form of flattery : by imitating and perpetuating his frightfulappearance . Among the Lamba-Djunge the girls were betrothedP199immediately on birth , and usually were married at the age of six or seven ; and the rest of their lives was spent in impersonating the ancestral beast  --  they wore these loathsome wooden disks , they covered their backs with tribal cicatrices , and they molded their hair into locks with crimson clay , which rattled lightly as they turned their heads . They were incredibly vain ; and their compulsoryhideousness had finally been turned into a kind of chic , a bizarre affectation of elegance and even beauty . The path led downhill through mighty tree ferns and mimosas . The men walked swiftly and noiselessly on their leathery feet , singingodd little fire songs and water songs and hammock songs . We crossed a foaming torrent over a bamboo bridge suspended from vines . Everything , in this damp prolific area , seemed disproportionateand disgusting . Fleets of dragonflies shot past and huge migrations of land crabs crawled along in a solid mass , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of silvery mucus along the trunks . Long white worms and acidulous bugs lay tucked in colonies beneath the rocks . Colossal mushrooms , shaped like gloves and helmets and teapots , lay scattered eerily among the ferns . Once a cloud of flying ants suddenly enveloped us , filling our eyes and nostrils with a spicy sting , like paprika . Now the path grew marshy . We were entering the Malawari swamp . Vile-smelling pools of water gurgled at every step and we had to step gingerly from mound to mound . Bubbles of gas sprang from the mud as it coiled around our ankles . We were caught in a fetid , motionless heat . This was an unspeakably corrupt and lacerated stretch of land , thick with the primordial slime . Stretches of shallow water shone through the haze , with great dim shapes stirring nebulously among the cattails . Momboola pointed ; we paused . There , in the mists of evening , two full-grown hippos were making love . They plunged and thrashed about , she with aP200high coquettish air , he with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous grunting and groaning , an unsavory dripping and expectoration . Threads of sea-green saliva trailed from his cavernous jaws ; and I detected an odor like that of ripe herring . The water rippled lightly against their bellies while the gnats swarmed above them in dusky spirals . She twisted and twitched in an indelicate manner : then she stood stock-still and closed her eyes mysteriously . She swayed slightly and seemed , perhaps , to smile . His idiotic tiny eyes were swollen with tears . He splashed about preposterously , blinded with love . Finally he seized and possessed her ; and the act reached a climax unutterably absurd , two vast snouts gaping skyward with a moan of anguish . It was over in a second . He slid back into the water with a look of mortification , while she sniffed among the reeds with a sly , satisfied air . We came to a halt beside the river M'Bala . Alessandro bandaged his swellings ; Marius opened a pack of cigarettes ; Joshua lay down exhausted and yawned . We were tired  --  fiercely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , all in the same instinctive posture ; some chewing , some muttering , some dozing , some excreting . They were falling , from sheer weariness , into identical forms of behavior ; they became merely a group ; they lost precision as men . It was a final strength-saving stratagem , perhaps . Suddenly I feared and detested them ; their stillness , their obscurity . We were sick , all four of us . Joshua 's eyes were red and swollen , almost blind , and his pale northern skin was violently inflamed . Marius was feverish with insect bites , and I was weak with malaria . But Alessandro was worst off ; his infections were spreading at an alarming rate ; and he was sinking into a strange chronic apathy . We spoke in whispers . We scarcely moved . We scarcely breathed . We were close to the border line . The strange dull calm of real extremity was falling over us . P201Beyond a turn in the river rose Mount Nagala . It looked utterly commonplace ; a peak in the jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery ; colorless , drab . Why on earth had we come ? The whole voyage seemed incredibly pointless , insane . We had quite forgotten our original reasons for coming ; we clung to empty pretexts , mutual protestations . The real motives had evaporated like steam in the fiery heat . Only an obscure necessitylingered on , an urge beyond logic , like the urge which drives the lemmings into the sea . " Yes , " said Marius , nudging me lightly . " It looks horrible , does n't it ? At last we 're almost there . And look at it . Just look at it . " " We 're almost there , " whimpered Joshua , " and now we 're wondering why we 've come . " " Yes , " said Alessandro suddenly , staring across the river with bloodshot eyes . " We 're almost there . But not quite . Not quite , my friends . " The light grew unexpectedly sharp beyond Nagala ; drawing a golden edge around the clouds , casting a golden sheet over the swamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleakness went . The earthliness faded . For an instant all things fell into a breath-taking harmony . The light flashed on the facets of granite and obsidian ; everything was drawn into the momentary perfection of things , that light which gathered in the world like a fisherman 's net drawn through the waters . Yes , there were times after all , unpredictable and blinding moments , when Africa did seem unimaginably lovely . Moments when the mists parted , the curtain rose , the light grew staggering , the filth and anarchy vanished . Those egg-shaped hills , range upon nameless range , would open their eyes like newly born creatures . The savannahs listened ; a great stillness filled the valley ; an overwhelmingfreshness flowed from the heart of things . For several minutes we were lost in a daydream ; we said nothing . Then Joshua turned to Alessandro . " What is it , Alessandro ? What does it mean to you ? "  | Alessandro raised his desolate face and stared at the hill ; with utter resignation , almost disgust . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It means all that I 'll never find . All that I 've wanted , sought , struggled for , groped for , bled for , sweated for , and secretly knew that I 'd never find . It means love , Joshua . It means fulfillment . And peace . " The young Negroes were bathing down in the M'Bala ; listlessly scattering the water over their bony shoulders . Now the light was dying . Balibobotee was building a fire . " To me , " I said dreamily , " it means something else . It means the inner darkness ; the uncontrollable . Call it nature if you wish . Or call it instinct . Call it unreason . Call it evil . Call it the devil . I long to see it face to face . I long to recognize it and touch it . And finally free myself of it . " " Yes , " said Joshua , turning toward me , drawing a deep breath . I could hardly see his face , the night was falling so swiftly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered , " it means God , Sam-bula . " " And to me , " said Marius brusquely , grinding his cigarette in the sand , " to me , my friends , it means death . " The prowling scents of the night gave way to those of early morning . A silvery freshness fell on the jungle for just a little while  --  for five minutes , perhaps , or ten  --  while the sunlight still was lean and hazy and horizontal . For a little while the great marshy flowers still sparkled with moisture and cast forth their fragrance  --  a whole labyrinth of scents , cool , subtle , pervasive , which created an invisible architecture among the trees , a brief and airy symmetry which was like a hymn to the power of light . But then the light sharpened . The rays grew tense and vertical . The leaves and the petals stiffened . The glint of dew vanished . The fine multifoliate fragrance died and a new scent emerged  --  the hard , brittle odor ofp203extermination . The heat swallowed everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The central mystery of things flowed forth , like poisonous sap under the blow of an axe ; it spread from bough to bough and from body to body . Preposterous new fauna uncoiled in the sizzling air and a new kind of anguish seized us  --  God knows what we really felt  --  pain , panic , defiance , an unspeakable boredom , an animal desolation that tore through reason like a spider web . We remembered nothing , we looked forward to nothing , we hoped and feared nothing : only the thrust of the flesh still clung to us , and that thin ghostly overtone , call it what you will , that hint of magic and divination which lingers on , like a wisp of smoke , when all trace of human discipline has boiled away . Nimbalimba painted a large white crescent on his chest . Osseladossa made a sacred paste of ashes and urine and kneaded it into his hair . Balibobotee kept humming a propitiatory song in praise of the turtle . Oudange picked up two bright blue feathers and tucked them into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one had ever made love , carrying a small green bottle at the end of a string . " What is that , Bambo ? " " My children , Sambula . And my grandchildren ! " " In that little bottle ? " He nodded gravely ; he uncorked the bottle and held it to the light . There was a faint , familiar scent of rotting proteins . It was his semen , he explained , which he made a policy of preserving each ' time ; soon the bottle would be full , and he would offer it to his bush spirit , and for a while , at least , he would be immune to harmful emanations . Poor Bambo was unbelievably thin . His eyes shone like blue coals . But there was a hidden strength in him , a virginal calm , just a hint of the miraculous . I put my arm around him , tilted his hideous little head , and kissed him gently on the brow . I-lis eyes grew glazed ; two tears oozed forth . " Sambula , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . "  |p204We  crossed the river M'Bala at Benagabou and finally entered the Kalagouma . This was the real and unconquerable core of Africa , the penetralia of the continent from which the breath of nature herself spread outward in gradual , tremendous ripples . Here the equatorial wood resembled a mighty mosque . Negroes moved silently under the boughs , laden with fetishes of elephant hair , hyena teeth , marabou feathers : " Thus they participate , " said Oudange , " in the intuition of the elephant , the slyness of the hyena , and the perspicacity of the marabou ! " Then Nimbalimba , terribly lean by now , took my arm and said in a whisper : " In three days we 'll be there , Sambula . " I nodded ; but I scarcely believed him . " Yes , we 'll be there , " he repeated tensely . " Now we are safe . All things are well . " I glanced at him quickly ; he caught my look ; he grew agitated . " You are never troubled ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest are sleeping ? " " Why should I be troubled , Nimbalimba ? If we are safe ? " " Ah , " said Nimbalimba unhappily , " our journey will be safe . But after we are there  --  then the unsafety begins ! " Nimbalimba was ill ; I could smell it in his breath . His face wasThe Bat 205P205lined and hollow and his single eye had lost its brightness . His wild warm look hung in the air like an all-consuming question . He walked quietly beside me for several minutes . Then he said with sudden misery : " Oh , Sambula , why must we go there ? What drives you there ? ' What is it ? Is it to show your strength ? Is it a northern craziness ? " I smiled wanly . " Perhaps . Yes , I suppose so , " I said . Nimbalimba 's face grew strangely gentle . He raised his arm and pointed . There , beyond the encircling fringe of the wood , a little bit to the east , rose Mount Nagala . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to grow alive : the radiance along the peak grew vibrant . The grossness of shape dissolved in the boiling purity of light . It seemed to move ; it seemed to swell ; it seemed about to spring . The shape grew leonine and the tassels of rock below the pinnacle shuddered in the windy light , like a great yellow mane . It blazed with the pride and the power of impregnability . As we walked along in silence I thought I heard a rumbling far away , like a gathering avalanche ; or like the roar of a beast of prey . I felt Alessandro close beside me . " Yes , " he panted . " Look at that hill . Look at it carefully . Today it 's yellow . Yesterday it was blue ; do you remember ? And the day before it was red . Tomorrow it may be black . Or maybe , who knows , it will be gone altogether . " His voice was feeble and listless , yet strangely intense ; the voice of a man in the grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " I feel that it hardly exists ; except in our hopes ; that it 's only a dream , a symptom of our illness . It represents all that obsesses us . Love , fear , annihilation . Sometimes it looks uncannily like a man . Have you noticed it too ? Yes , it 's something that we who 've lost our God are building into a god . Does He love us , do you think ? Will He ever forgive us ? " " Come , my dear , " said Balibobotee , as we approached Gouassa . " Come ; we 'll visit the bokonon. "  | The bokonon was the prophet who lived near Gouassa . Or rather , the interpreter , the diviner of omens . We came to a painted hut with a low , tangled roof . A smiling old man , surprisingly light in color , almost cafe au lait , sat cross-legged in front of a carved mahogany table on which stood a row of idols , all in the usual state of priapism . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkling water over the sand and scrutinizing the pattern left by the drops . " Greetings , " said Balibobotee . " How are you , Bwa'hala ? " The bokonon ignored him and looked at me in a disconcerting way . " Well , what is it , " he said airily , " that you 're looking for today ? " Without waiting for an answer he handed me a little bowl , in which lay a single polished palm nut . " Whisper your question , " said the bokonon softly , " to the nut , please . " I raised the bowl and whispered my question to the nut , and returned the bowl to the bokonon ; who placed the nut to his ear , rolled it around in his palm , and raised it to his nostrils . He looked at me with his small audacious eyes . His expression was one of a deep and clever sweetness , and his hands lay on the white sand like lobster claws , bright vermilion in the evening light . He seemed to smile : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " he murmured finally . " You 'll find what you 're looking for , I suppose . But I ca n't be sure . " " When will I find it ? " I asked him . " And where ? " He looked down at the white sand and at the bowl with the palm nut . " I do n't know , " he said , smiling apologetically . " It is full of confusion . I can guess , but I ca n't be sure . " The hut was filled with a loathsome stench of human refuse . Something stirred in the corner  --  a tiny yellow animal with a long black snout . Was it possible that the bokonon did know , after all , but pretended not to ? Merely human understanding was out of its depth here . Perhaps he really did see into the future with those rubylike eyes ; or perhaps he was a victim ; or perhaps he was a fox . P207Or again , perhaps he understood something of a totally different nature  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misgivings . Balibobotee tiptoed away , and I was left alone with the bokonon . The bokonon turned and spoke to me in a new , intimate tone . " Yes , I know , " he said in a warm , wonderfully peaceful and soothingvoice , " to you it seems strange . You live under a different sun . You believe in different laws . I 've been sitting in this but ever since I was a child . I 've never left it . My eyes are used only to darkness . I 've never , for forty years , looked into the daylight . So my sight , you see , has become exceptional . I can see through things . I can see the bones of the world . The visible world  --  trees , birds , monkeys  --  all drift away . It 's only an accident , the skin and hair which covers the body . You live , your skin is white , and presently you die : it 's all only an accident . But the bones of the world are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die but exist forever and ever , and your skin is neither white nor black , but a beautiful pearly gray . " He placed his hands around the bowl and set the palm nut rolling around ; he sighed contentedly . " We know that something in us is undestroyable . But what ? Our bodies ? No , no . Our achievements ? Our children ? No , no . Our love ? Our fear ? Perhaps ; but probably no . Need we know exactly what it is ? The important thing is to know that something in us , something tiny , maybe no larger than a toenail or an eyelash , was always alive and will stay alive when we are dead . And it is this knowledge , my dear white child , which holds all men together , even in the darkest places , and creates an endless alliance of man . All other alliances are an illusion . All other alliances lead to misery . " Deeper and deeper ; darker and darker . No place in the world , I felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing looked clear . Nothing looked reasonable . Everything seemed laden with an oppressive double entendre . Life was like an echo ; even death was an ambiguity . I looked around at Alessandro and Marius , at Momboola and Osseladossa . Suddenly I realized how appallingly all of us had changed . We were haggard and sick and spasmodically feverish , we were invalids , we were living altogether on our nerve . Complete exhaustion lay just around the corner ; we were skimming along on the very edge of lunacy . We had changed , changed incalculably . We were stripped of surface oddities  --  they had been luxuries , after all  --  and the basic , ungovernable oddities at the root of the soul were exposed . We were scraps of humanity struggling , struggling to keep alive ; and yet for that very reason our hearts grew keener , and our natures grew deeper , simpler , more intrinsic . The energy for the maintenance of complexities had been burned away . The individual lacework faded , the universal mask emerged . Treachery , kindness , stupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The climate of the Congo was like a powerful X ray which penetrated all disguises and gradually revealed , with fearful clarity , the spiritual skeleton of a man . On we crept through this eternal vegetable twilight . Everything was hypersensitive ; sight and sound and intuition took on a razoredgedacuteness . We heard the beetles grinding within the trunks , we saw the cobwebs floating through the summits of trees . The cicadas began to scream , like a surgical instrument boring into the brain , piercing and lacerating the fragile membranes . I found a baby bat among the roots of a tree , with its wrinkled wings wrapped around it like a cape . I held it in the palm of my hand ; it was fluffy and weightless as a moth . I stretched out one of the wings ; the fabric was breath-takingly delicate , tremulous as thistledown . It quivered with anguish , its tiny face peered at me desperately , tortured by the intolerable grossness of light and sound playing upon its tissues ; and it uttered a shrill , almost inaudible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed nerves in my hand . The Bat 209p209That night we were too weary to reach Gouassa . We flung ourselves on the mossy ground at dusk , too listless even to be hungry . Balibobotee opened our last tin of meat and boiled us a pot of tea ; we smoked our last cigarettes and fell into a deep dispirited slumber . Now the trees drew closer ; the air grew hypnotic . I could hear poor old Balibobotee whimpering in his sleep . Nimbalimba was snoring gently ; Momboola was groaning . Bambo had built a tiny cage out of wire and filled it with fireflies : it hung from a bough , vibrating very faintly with a greenish-white glow and weaving its phosphorescent pattern on the long beards of moss . I listened closely  --  from an infinite distance came the sound of some great storm stirring in the pit of the world , some uncontrollable shifting of the seas , some grinding at the very base of Eurasia . The leaves rustled ; the air cooled . An echo floated overhead , so faint as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then stillness again . And the full flood of the night . The jungle night . More than blackness , immeasurably more than stillness . The real unmitigated night in all its wild complexity , its animality , its rank , impenetrable vastness . Moonlight hung in the boughs ; it hung in long hazy strands , silvering the vines and fungi , shedding a ghostly pattern on the wild old trunks . A stealthy odor radiated from the earth , a blend of night-blooming flowers , ancient roots , budding rushes . A telepathic music emerged ; I listened still more closely . There was a piercing note in the distance , like the sound of a mighty violin , now poignant and throbbing and now too low to be heard . A new agitation crept through the jungle , a nervous tension touched with despair . The sound gradually deepened . Nimbalimba stopped snoring . Momboola had vanished . I sat absolutely still : there , thirty feet away , beside a fallen trunk , two dark bodies were stirring , locked in some horrible sort ofP210struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a thick , vicious thrust of the loins . I smelled the scent of sexual crisis . There was a low quick snarl , like a cat 's . Then silence . Nothing more . The jungle night withdrew , crouching beyond the trees with its eyes fixed on us , like a wild bird watching its paralyzed victim . Toward dawn I heard a feeble cry among the trees . I always slept lightly , but of late more lightly than usual . A snapping twig , a crackling ember was enough to wake me up . I rose . A faint gray pallor was beginning to haunt the wood , I could see the shapes of the men on the ground , rigid and inert , like fallen statues . I counted them instinctively ; one was missing ; Nimbalimba . I stared through the misty trees . I was about to call : and then I saw him . Or what I saw , rather , was a shadowy creature on all fours creeping with a dreadful uncouthness through the brush , shaking with some uncontrollable spasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran up and called his name . He opened his mouth and tried to speak ; his tongue fell out , blackened , distended like a polyp . He muttered something . I leaned over . I could smell the poison in his blood . " What is it , Nimbalimba ? What 's happened ? " He fell over on his side , shuddering and foaming with pain , and pointed a withered shaking hand to his ankle . It was furiously swollen , the skin shone like glass . Then he whispered heavily : " I am in pain , Sambula . Stay . Do n't leave me . " He leaned his head against me and closed his one eye . " It will be better soon , " I muttered . " Let me call Jassa . " " Do n't call Jassa , " he whispered . " Jassa can help you , Nimbalimba . " " No man can help me , " he said in a fierce hot sigh . I placed my hand on his forehead ; it was boiling . He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to vomit . Then he fell back again , shivering wildly . He grew utterly limp . I understood : he had crept into the brush to die , like an animal . I stroked his dripping forehead . " Do n't be frightened , " I whispered . " Dear Nimbalimba . " He clutched wildly at my hand and kissed it . I leaned down ; I could smell the horrible sweetness of death rising from him . And then he stopped shivering . The sweat grew dry under my hand . They all gathered around the dead boy silently . Oudange examined his ankle : yes , he knew what had happened . The boy had been struck by a huge black mamba . We buried him immediately after sunrise . The Negroes placed him in his grave in a sitting position , as was proper , wearing his scarlet fez , with a drinking cup beside him , and a little pot to cook his food , and a small bottle of salt . Osseladossa fondled the dead boy 's wrist watch yearningly , but Oudange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Momboola , who was the oldest , knelt beside the grave and scattered the earth on the boy 's head ; he pointed to the sky and began to chant . Ndjoluva reached down and seized the dead boy 's hand and cried farewell . And Bambo , who had especially loved Nimbalimba , lay down on his belly beside the grave , buried his tattooed face in the earth and wept bitterly . Joshua knelt down and prayed ; he too had been fond of Nimbalimba . Then we rose without a word and started through the trees toward Gouassa . This was the twenty-seventh day of our journey . The grasses hissed : a vile humidity filled the air . P212Sometimes a bird dove past and stirred the air with the sweep of wings ; the feathers flashed like a great orchid and were gone . And for a moment everything seemed a bit less terrible . But only for a moment . The ferocity of the sun had withered our minds . The intolerable dampness had sapped our strength . The ache and anxiety hung from us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , not the slightest nestle . Our pride , our sense of privacy had vanished completely , we had lost even the faintest remnant of shame . Everything was done in the open , grossly , flagrantly . We all squatted in the shade at dawn and at dusk ; and the Negroes , in the grip of lust , relieved themselves with an apelike exhibitionism . Only Ndjoluva , I noticed , was a shade more fastidious : he still preferred to step discreetly among the bushes . An odd little thing occurred near Gouassa . I saw him crouching in the shade of a small banana tree . His posture was unusual ; I had a vague impression that he might be suffering from hemorrhoids . He reached down , with a meditative look in his eyes , and drew a small bright object from the sphincter ; he slipped it on his little finger with a dreamy smile ; he cocked his head ; then he grew tense and preoccupied . Presently he drew the ring from his fingerThe Lion 213P213and restored it cautiously to the rectum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled when he saw me . " So it was n't really the frogs , " I said , " who stole my ring , Ndjoluva ? " He looked guiltily at the ground . " Frogs ? " he whispered . " Which frogs ? " " You know perfectly well , " I said bitterly . " Come . Give me my ring , Ndjoluva . " He cast a pleading look at me . " No , no , bwana ! Please ! Ndjoluva needs the golden medicine . Without it Ndjoluva suffers . From the tiny demons . Please , bwana . . . " So I shrugged my shoulders . " Well , keep the ring , " I said , with dignity . " But never speak to me about the frogs , please , Ndjoluva . " That afternoon it began to rain slightly and Momboola pitched our tent for us . I sat in the stuffy darkness beside the sick man , while Marius and Oudange went out with a gun . Alessandro turned his sunken face to me and began to whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sambula ? You 'll be there in another day or two . Yes , you 'll be there . But not I. Wait . Let me finish . I knew I 'd never reach Nagala . I knew it when I started . I 've never reached anything . It 's always been just beyond my reach  --  love , genius , peace of mind , salvation itself  --  I 've struggled for them , God , how I 've struggled ! But I was born unlucky . I was born split in two . I was born half dead . Listen , Sambula . You think my sicknessis one of the body ? You 're wrong . It 's a sickness of the soul , pure and simple . I believe in nothing . I 've nothing to live for , nothing to fight for , nothing to die for . I 've nothing left but a sense of utter confusion filling the world . Infinite confusion , infinite falseness . They call Africa the Dark Continent . But it 's a blaze , a dazzle of truth compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is filled with the real sorcerers and idolaters ! I 've been a perpetual exile , Sambula . . . . " " We 're all exiles , " I said softly . " But it takes strength , " sighed Alessandro . " And I 've no strength left . I 've come to the end , Sambula .... " His head fell back , a violent tremor shot through him . His face grew frozen ; it was the face of a corpse . The rain stopped and I crept through the bamboo grove down to the dell where I heard the waters tinkling . The evening sun shot forth for an instant before setting . The bamboo stalks were crested with a red-hot powder ; they rustled as I passed , brittle and glassy . Once I turned . I thought I heard footsteps somewhere behind me . But no . Nothing stirred , absolutely nothing . There was the humming of cicadas and the trickling of waters , the sense of a breathless climactic pause . I turned again . What was it ? Stealthily following me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw nothing . Silence covered the wood ; it crouched over the pool . Silence hung from the boughs like a long gray moss . Silence hung in the very light , which was deepening to a reptilian gray . Through the trees I could see the broken outline of Nagala , uncannily near . Here the brush was opulent and thorny . I stooped to burrow my way toward the water . A large plum-colored snake was threadingits way through the fallen vines . It paused and raised its flat , vindictive head , showing the china-smooth gleam of its throat . Its tongue flicked lightly as it flowed under a log . I reached the edge of the pool and saw the forest come to an end . Beyond the water lay a stretch of savannah , tufted here and there with casuarina trees . A layer of fog was gathering over the shore . Now I saw the great pyramid of Nagala clearly : it had cast off the glitter of bronze , the leonine splendor . It looked hideousP215and truculent , like a rhinoceros ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it was twilight  --  that strangely beautiful and incredibly brief interval between day and night , which in Africa is like a sudden lapse of consciousness , a momentary withdrawal into anotherepoch : an instant of miraculous peace among all animals . A cool gray light fell over the pool . A herd of shadows was moving over the plain toward the water . They paused at the edge and drank . I could see their bearded profiles , their black ponderous chests as they raised and lowered their heads . Strangely gentle they looked , in all their shaggy brutality ; exquisitely pastoral and serene . They paused , flicking their tails and casting their heads to drive off the gnats . Then they strolled along the shore and vanished into the dusk . Another herd now rose out of the mist , antlered and circumspect , slenderer than the buffaloes . The moon was rising : an icy glow fell on the labyrinth of heads and horns . These were the large antelopes , Hippotragus equinus . They stood in a stately phalanx along the shore , bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain . I saw the gleam of ripples spreading across the pool . Now smaller creatures were gathering , singly and in twos ; I could see them ever so faintly among the reeds , jackals perhaps , a lynx or two , possibly a panther . Once I saw the frail , shivering silhouette of a gazelle . And then abruptly there was stillness . An electrical pause hung over the shore ; the drinking beasts grew motionless , then shot into the darkness . For three or four minutes the shore was deserted . The truce had come to an end . The real night had begun . And out of the thicket I saw one last shape come gliding and raising its mighty head , incomparably majestic ; the single shape from which all the others had fled . The eyes shone like lanterns . The devastating strength hung rippling about the shoulders like a shawl . The long pale body passed noiselessly through the reeds , paused at the water 's edge , looked casually about , bowed to drink , gazed at    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
