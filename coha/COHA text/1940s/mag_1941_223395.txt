United Aircraft Corp . this week announced the biggest aviation stock offering in ten years : 265,669 shares of convertible preferred stock at $100 a share , to be offered to United 's 35,000 shareholders . <P> Paradoxically , United will use the proceeds ( about $26,000,000 ) not for expansion but to pull in its horns . As it was when it set aside a $4,000,000 reserve ( TIME , Nov. 17 ) , it is thinking of the day when the war will be over . With a backlog of $500,000,000 and less than $25,000,000 in capital , United is financing its roaring business out of sales . But when those Gov ernment checks stop arriving , it will have to have more capital . There will be conversion and development expenses . And United may want to buy the $40,000,000 worth of plants the Government has been building for its use .
