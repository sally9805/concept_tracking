Down from a Trans-Siberian Railway carriage at the frontier station of Manchouli stepped Japan 's Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka one day last week . His hair was full of cinders and his head was full of plans . It was good to set foot once again on the soil of Manchukuo , since the previous Sunday more securely Japanese than ever . " I had not expected a neutrality pact with Russia at all , " grinned Yosuke Matsuoka . " It was negotiated in ten minutes . " <P> On to Tokyo sped the pleased little diplomat , through border country from which Japanese troops were already being moved south to new spheres of action . In his brief case was the precious pact , signed by himself and Russia 's Premier Viacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov just a week before . Tokyo newspapers were already hailing it as a " new sword " in Japan 's hand , with which Japan would try to settle its differences with Great Britain , the U.S. , The Netherlands Indies and China-diplomatically , if possible . If diplomacy did not succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> On the other side of the border , in Siberia , troops were also on the move , going westward and to the southwest . Russia , as well as Japan , had need of the seasoned soldiers who had stood guard in the northeast of Asia . If Adolf Hitler 's legions ousted Great Britain from the Near East , an outlet to the Persian Gulf might be Russia 's if she could take it . <P> Pravda Speaks . These troop movements explained why the pact was made , as well as how it would work . To wishful thinkers who thought it was not worth the paper it was written on , the Communist Party 's Pravda had some rude words to say . " All arguments of the British and American press lead one to conclude that . . . the pact . . . disturbed the plans of London and Washington politicians . " Citing Washington reports that the U.S. had hoped to lure Moscow into keeping Japan from attacking Singapore and the East Indies Pravda added : " The ' ungrateful ' Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pact . . . directed against embroiling the Soviet Union in war . Is n't that annoying ? ' ' <P> Pravda also took the trouble to deny that Germany had put pressure on Russia to sign , stated flatly that the Kremlin had refused an invitation to join the Axis last November . In other words , Russia was playing a lone hand , with the object of keeping out of trouble . If by keeping out of trouble Russia got others into trouble , that would be so much the better . <P> Security First has been Russia 's policy since strong , expansionist states grew up on either side of her . When collective security failed , the Kremlin turned to an opportunistic , but no less consistent , policy of diverting aggression elsewhere . The Non-Aggression Pact with Germany turned Germany toward other enemies , has made Russia secure from German attack through a year and a half of war . Last fortnight 's pact may mean security against Japan for longer . And by last fortnight Joseph Stalin must have feared a day would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be juicy pickings in the Middle East . Already there were reports that Russia had demanded the northern provinces of Iran , " to protect the Baku oil fields . "
