ALAS , THE POOR SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT 441 V G ONE is the image of Jehovah ; gone the public inspector rustling in academic gown . What we have today in the school administrator is a general factotum for the system , staggering under a load of duties but without any true business of his own . And we shall hardly create a better functionary until we decide what the schools are for . Surely no man is versatile enough to meet the qualifications which the profession demands of him now : the managerial boss , the public relations expert , the leader who inspires others to teach . With the expansion of our schools to include " all the youth of all the people , " no board has thought to stake out the limits of the school . How can the school be a spiritual force in the community when it is becoming a mere duplication of the community , and when the latest argument among educators is whether the school should move out into the community or the community be brought into the school ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run the whole education of the community , taking the whole town to be his school . If there were only a municipal beginners ' band , a town-endowed theater , a tax-supported " Y , " then we could let the school , which does all these things badly , concentrate on other matters . Back in 1878 , the superintendent at least knew what the proper job should be . According to the Minneapolis Annual Report of that year : " To devise a course of study for a school population as large as ours , and to arrange it so that no matter when the pupil comes into it , or how long he remains , he shall get the greatest possible good , is one of the unsolved problems of our time . " After seventy years of fumbling , the high-pressure , eating-meeting head of our schools has come no closer to a solution than the writer of that report . The paradox of our educational system is that the classroom teacher is fundamentally more important than her boss , that we venerate the great teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The responsibility comes back to the people in the end . If we continue to see the school as a little replica of the community , the pupils will become success-hounds , materialists , and in the sacred name of freedom and democracy , self-seekers . But if we believe ? as we indicate that we do by our instinctive respect for good teaching  --  that education is , above all else , the act of spiritual evaluation , of weighing action , of appreciation of things seen and unseen , of searching into meaning , of establishing relationships , then we must make clear that this is the aim of our schools . The teachers ' colleges have certainly dinned into us the text  --  as formulated by Bolton , Cole , and Jessup  --  that " not only is it the privilege of the superintendent to be a discoverer of those things that promote the world 's advancement , but it is even a rarer opportunity to stimulate others to accomplish these things . Every superintendent must stimulate some of his teachers to accomplish more than he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who tailors himself to every whim of the times . If we want the school administrator to believe that his primary function is to promote creative teaching , then we must stop asking him to spread himself thin . And we must train him to give us schools not " like life , " but better than life . THE LAST GENERATION A Story MIRIAM ALLEN DEFORD N O ATTEMPT was made to conceal the accident that occurred in the desert of New Mexico on May 11 , 1950 . It would have been impossible to keep it secret , since two internationally-known physicists , a high-ranking Army officer , and a prominent Senator from the Deep South lost their lives in the disaster . The explosion itself was singularly small . The seventeen men killed  --  the rest were workmen and minor scientists  --  died from concussion and asphyxiation . There was no fire . A lake of green glass suddenly appeared in the sand waste , but the atomic waves were dissipated quickly . There was no delayed bodily erosion as in Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed was proof that no chain reaction had been started . The organizers of the experiment counted their dead and breathed freely again . The first significant date after that was May 31st , the next one June 2d . These passed unnoticed . Rats and mice still infested fields and houses and peopled laboratories . Perhaps some laboratory workers observed that no litters of white mice appeared after the beginning of June . Puppies and kittens arrived regularly until the middle of July ; after that , pet owners and breeders were puzzled to see that the animals mated , but did not breed . A Dr. Wardour , of Melbourne , seems to have been the first to make public a suspicion of the horrible truth . Doubtlessother physicians had already confirmed it so far as they themselves were concerned , but kept it quiet on the supposition that it applied to them alone , and was a reflection on their professional standing . But Dr Wardour was so popular an obstetrician that he felt morally sure it was not some sudden boycott that caused him to have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovered that no physician in Melbourne had been visited after that date by any woman newly pregnant . None of them had any deliveries scheduled for after the following March . The alarmed investigation spread throughout Australia , then to the entire civilized world . Reluctantly at first , and then in panic , medical associations queried their members . Maternity hospitals followed suit . By the end of 1950 , the answer was given with appalling finality . So far as could be ascertained , every mammal on earth , male and female , from the lowliest platypus to man himself , was sterile . The unmanageable and unpredictable rays from New Mexico had done their work . II NITIAL endeavors to keep the terrible news quiet were , as might have been foreseen , entirely futile . An enterprising reporter on a New York paper nosed it out almost at once . For months the front page of every newspaper in every city dealt with no other subject . Second-rate scientists erupted in predictions and pronouncements : the damage was temporary ; it would last a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect only this generation ; a way to reverse the action was in course of discovery , had already been discovered . The first-rate scientists kept their mouths shut , or said frankly that not enough was known about what had happened to make any predictions at all . Quacks with sure-fire cures ran riot , until in most countries they were rounded up and jailed . Among the masses of the ignorant , in the depths of India and China and Africa , witch doctors became the dominant rulers of the frightened people . There was the usual rise in the suicide rate which occurs whenever people balanced delicately on the edge receive a sudden unbalancing shock . A Mrs. Jenkins of Lancashire , England , for a while became world-famous by her insistence , with supporting evidence , that she was going to have a baby . When , against her protests , she was examined by a London surgeon , she was shown to be suffering from a tumor . Mental hospitals and psychiatric clinics were crowded by women convinced that they were pregnant ; so common did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special form of mental disorder . Meanwhile , time went on and there was no change . Observation of other domestic animals  --  such as sheep and swine  --  was limited because of their set seasons for breeding . Experiments with cows and horses showed that they were affected just as were human beings ; and zoos soon reported the same of their captive animals . The last child known to have been born on earth was the youngest daughter of peasants in southern Sweden . Her birthday was April 16 , 1951 . Her mother had carried her four other children a correspondingly long time . The child 's name was Ingrid Anderson . R IT became definitely certain that , for an unforeseeable period at least , the human race , together with all other species of the mammalia , had come to an end , large mass-effects began to be felt . If the variation in the genes caused by the atomic rays were permanent , then humanity 's day was over . When the youngest children now alive were dead ? say by 2070 at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for a few surviving elephants and whales , the world would by then be left to the birds , the fish , the reptiles , the insects , and other sub-mammalian orders . Even if this suddenly induced sterility were not inherited , and the next generation were able to continue the race , a severe dislocation of life was inevitable . And even by the end of 1951 , three major results of the disaster had become solidified . In the first place , children became the only hope of humanity . For the first time in the world 's sad history , children became so valuable that nowhere on earth was a child hungry , or cold , or abused . The death of a child was the supreme calamity , the killing of a child the most atrocious and severely-punished crime . Next , with universal death staring it in the face , mankind at last turned in horror from the thought of war . The struggling and weak United Nations unanimously transformed itself into a true World Federation , with plenipotentiary powers . Humanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in the third place  --  though many branches of science were neglected in despair  --  the physicists , biophysicists , chemists , and biologists became the most important and powerful people on earth . Education in these fields was widespread and intensive . Anything research workers desired was theirs  --  except experimental animals , for after two or three years , there were no more rats or guinea pigs to be had , and jealously cherished dogs and cats were guarded by their owners . There was no lack , however , of men and women who eagerly offered themselves for experimental purposes . Most of these were young people frustrated of parenthood ; others offered themselves solely for the good of humanity . There were not lacking also those possessed by an itch for publicity ; and as the years went on , many persons sought their livelihood by this means , since gradually one trade and industry after another ceased to exist . Makcrs of baby foods and clothing for infants went first , together with obstetricians and midwives ; then , in order , followed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , nursery school managers , writers of juvenile books , toymakers , and all the rest . Long before the first child of the latest generation became nubile , it was dishearteningly obvious that the transformation caused by the 1950 accident was hereditary ; for the last kittens and puppies grew up , came into heat , mated  --  but no offspring appeared . Young people were allowed and urged to marry as young as possible , and by 1970 millions of them had done so , all over the world . But no child was conceived . Microscopic examinations made of sample sections of the populations of all countries showed the same invariable findings  --  complete lack of viability of both ova and sperm . By 1971 , nobody on earth was less than twenty years old . There were hardly any dogs and cats left on earth , and only a few old cows and horses . Rats , mice , and squirrels had long been gone , and with them some diseases , such as plague , typhus , and tularemia , had practically ceased to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were no schools of lower than college grade , and soon there would be no need for any except those for advanced study . Zoos were almost depopulated , most of their live exhibits having been replaced by cleverly stuffed and mounted animals . Hundreds of professions and occupations had ceased to exist , either because they had catered to children or adolescents , or because they depended on animal industry . In many  --  though far from all  --  cases those trained in these fields were able to make adaptations ; pediatricians , for example , became specialists in geriatrics ; plastics took the place of leather or furs , though surviving specimens of these vanishing commodities became far more valuable than pearls or diamonds . Dairy farmers and their subsidiaries were hard hit , since there was no more milk , butter , or cheese . Butchers and cattle ranchers were out of a job ; there was no more beef , pork , or lamb , and people lived entirely on chickens and other fowl. , fish , vegetables , and fruit , with a sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rattlesnake steaks . Even the most overpopulated portions of the globe were beginning to look empty , as the older inhabitants died off . This was least apparent in such places as India , partly because of the removal of tigers and other predatory animals . However , the huge increase in cobras now that there were no mongooses almost balanced that slight advantage . In Europe and America , and in the Antipodes , the lowering of the population was easily observable . Ironically enough , the human race in dying became also healthier than it had ever been . There was enough food for everybody now , even the poorest ; moreover , the imminence of universal extinction gave sharp impetus to medical research . If a man could no longer hope to survive in his descendants , then at least he wanted to stay alive as long as possible . ( The earlier suicide wave had dropped to almost nothing . ) On the other hand , the impossibility of handing on property beyond the next generation killed the urge toward accumulation of great wealth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all their fortunes for the benefit of the general public . O N APRIL 16 , 1971 , Ingrid Anderson , the youngest human being on earth , celebrated her twentieth birthday . By pure chance , this girl had become a symbol . It was on this date that the World Government formally established four research commissions , with quarters in Shanghai , Chicago , Paris , and Moscow , for a final intensive effort to discover a way to reverse the disaster of May 11 , 1950 . They became known as the Ingrid Anderson Research Commissions  --  popularly known as IARC . IARC had a specified life-span of twenty years . When the youngest woman on earth was forty , she might still , in the old days , be quite capable of child-bearing for several years to come ; but it was unlikely that if the scientists discovered a means of re-inducing human fertility , enough women in their forties would conceive for the first time to repopulate the earth and preserve our intricate industrial civilization . Nearly all the most eminent scientists alive were workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited . At first they were all members of the generation alive in 1950 ; gradually young people from what was ( rather hopelessly ) universally known as the Last Generation joined the staffs , After 1980 most of the men and women who had been active scientific workers thirty years before had grown old , resigned , or died . At that date the average age of IARC was 42.5 . Nearly all of them were married . There were , of course , no children . The four sections of IARC communicated daily with one another by television-. phone and teletype , besides which the chiefs of staff held frequent conferences in one or another of the headquarters cities , since by this time every part of the earth was within five hours of every other part by rocket plane . The language they employed was Esperanto . When the World Government , now permanently located in San Francisco , celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the first United Nations Conference for International Organization , in 1985 , the directors of IARC were the principal guests of honor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitless facilities , none of their lines of investigation and experiment had proved successful . It was understood , of course , that no announcement would ever be made unless it was the one great announcement for which a sick and terrified humanity waited . IARC was heavily guarded ; no leaks ever seeped out to cause panic or frantic hope . And the years went on , and still IARC was silent . In 1988 , the youngest people in the world were thirty-seven years old . There was no youth left on earth , and very little laughter . A realization even more dreadful than humanity 's extinction itself had seized the Last Generation : for the first time its members were brought face to face with the horrifying probabilities of their future . Unless I.A.R.0 could work a seeming miracle , inevitably the time would come when all living men and women would be at least seventy years old , then eighty , then ninety , then a hundred or more . How could civilization be maintained by ahandful of feeble old people ? What of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its great cities falling to ruins , there would be only half a dozen centenarians ? What  --  worst of all  --  of the unfortunate old creature who would find himself or herself the last human being ? As the dreadful possibilities grew more clear , two parallel waves struck the Last Generation , affecting particularly those in the most advanced centers of culture  --  a wave of religious mysticism , drowning fear and horror in a dream ; and a cologaa/ wave of suicides , far greater than that at the beginning of the era  --  and this although attempted and unsuccessful suicide was now rated next to murder in the hierarchy of crime , and heavily punished . Mankind as a whole began to divide roughly into three categories : those who had given way to despair and terror , who lived only to escape from reality , either by the feverish pursuit of pleasure , the ecstasy of mysticism , or the desperate gate of suicide ; those too bovine and inert , too unimaginative , to face the future ; and those who still had faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special meeting . of the chiefs of staff of IARC was called in the Paris headquarters . IARC was strictly international ; its staffs were of all peoples , and it was seldom that anyone was attached to a headquarters situated in his own country . The chief of the Shanghai IARC was an American Negro , Arthur Ramsdell . The Chicago chief was Joseph Callahan , whose father had been Irish , his mother a German Jewish refugee settled in Mexico . These represented the older generation  --  both had been boys in 1951 . The other two were younger . The Moscow chief was a woman , Renee Loisy , who despite her French name had also English and Russian blood . The Paris chief was Chinese ; his name was Liu Chen-ping . All of those attending the conference , and indeed all the more responsible members of their staffs as well , knew why the meeting had been called . It was a crucial conference  --  the most crucial IARC had ever held . But there was little formality in the gathering ; these people knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in daily communication for many years . " Loisy is ready to make her report , " said Callahan . " Fellow-workers , " said Renee Loisy , without preliminaries , " I have to announce that I am pregnant . The father of my child is my husband , Karel Batak , who as you know is also a member of our Moscow staff . " I need not remind you that as this new line of investigation began to look more hopeful , I volunteered to be its subject , since by its very nature it might be fatally dangerous if unsuccessful , and we did not consider it right to allow anyone outside our ranks to undergo that peril . You will also remember that a year ago this council voted to permit Karel Batak to join me in the experiment . " What seventeen years of research by means of radioactive waves , glandular therapy , serology , infra-red light treatment , and every other conceivable method has uniformly failed to accomplish , has at last been brought about by the simple but revolutionary means you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our colleague , Arthur Ramsdell . " She paused . Modestly Ramsdell waved away a respectful murmur . " What has succeeded with Batak and me will undoubtedly succeed with every healthy man and woman of proper age , " Loisy went on . " There remains now only to plan making our announcement to the world in such a way as to avoid undue excitement and confusion , and then to make our final report to the World Government and to dissolve IARC . " The human race has been saved from extinction ! " uoa a minute there was an awed silence . J It was interrupted by Liu Chen-ping . " One moment , " he said in his soft voice . " I think there is more than that for us to determine . " " What , then ? " asked Joseph Callahan. " 1 ask you to hear me out before you comment on what I am going to say , " Liu continued . " To some  --  perhaps to all  --  of you it will seem monstrous . But I should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak . " What I want you to consider , straightforwardly and solemnly , is whether it is after all desirable to preserve the species to which we belong . " I can see your horror at my words . But increasingly , for fourteen years , I have had before my mind 's eye a contrast  --  a contrast between the world as it was in 1950 , and the world as it is today . " I was not born in 1950 . But I have read ? read not only the literature of before that date , but also the innumerable works on history , economics , and politics published since . I have I think , as keen a grasp on the realization of the past as has the oldest man or woman alive . " In the half-century preceding 1950 , the whole globe had twice been ravaged by a devastating total war , and a third such war was imminent . Today there is no war . " In 1950 the world was divided among more than a hundred sovereign nationalities , each jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a universal World Government , democratically elected and conducted , and with authority over every human being on earth . " In 1950 mass starvation and famine , and disastrous economic depressions , were endemic . Today everyone in the world is well fed , well clothed , well housed , well educated . " I need not mention other aspects of the situation  --  the prevalence of crime in 1950 , its virtual absence today ; the treatment of alien races and nationalities by peoples numerically superior to them ; the relative position of the sexes then and now . " Re-people the world , and how can we guarantee that we are not thereby bringing back all the evils which in 1950 made life hardly worth the living to at least a large minority of its inhabitants ? " You will say , I know , that even this is better than extinction of the human race . All I ask you to consider now , deeply and soberly , is : is it ? " His voice dropped . Callahan was the first to speak . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have known these doubts . Nevertheless I am not in agreement with Liu . " The contrast he has drawn is true and painful . But the worst he foresees is still only a possibility . There is the other possibility that this hard eAperience has taught humanity a lesson  --  that the human race may never , especially since its first new members will be guided by us of this generation , go back to the bad old days . " And there is another and vitally important matter which I think we have forgotten . Loisy is to have a child ? " " If Liu 's voice carries , " said Renee Loisy in a low murmur , " I agree that that child can never be born . The first child to be conceived since 1950 will also be the last child to be conceived , forever . " " That too , Loisy , " Callahan continued . " But I was thinking of something else . We must face . facts . A complete and radical variation in evolution such as overtook all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not simple and unconnected ; it must have infinite ramifications and repercussions . " How do we know that a re-reversal such as we have brought about by Rams-dell 's method will not be equally complex ? To put it baldly , how do we know that the children born henceforth will be physically and mentally normal ? The answer is that we do not know . We have no way , short of waiting to see , to find out how far heredity itself has been altered by this twofold wrench at its foundations . " As I said , I am , in spite of everything , opposed to Liu 's opinion . But if we override his proposal , then I am in favor of keeping our secret not only until after Loisy 's child has been born , but until enough other children have been born ( probably , for the sake of secrecy , to other members of our staffs ) to be sure that they are healthy , sound creatures . In other words , I recommend that we reserve our announcement for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  April 16 , 1991 . " Ramsdell , what is your feeling on this matter ? " Arthur Ramsdell 's deep voice spoke hesitantly . T MAY be because I come from a race I with a deep biological instinct , " he said slowly , " but I can not agree with Liu . I hope you will believe that it is not because by chance nit on the method which finally solved our problem . I feel merely that life itself is sacred and desirable , at all costs and at all risks . For myself , I would rather be a Negro child born in America in 1935 , as I was  --  with all that that implies  --  than never to have been born at all . " I want to say , though , that if the majority opinion is against me , you can count on me loyally and faithfully to obey ; and I know we can all say that of ourselves and of those members of our staffs who have even a glimpse of precisely what our recent work has been . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest researches , and announce on April 16 , 1991 , that we have failed . I suggest that if we decide to do this , we devote the remaining two years and eight months of our existence to the solving of another problem  --  a date and a means for euthanasia of the last remnants of our species . The fate of a few old people , alone in a life they can no longer maintain , waiting only to die of hungex and neglect , is too horrible for any civilized person to contemplate . " However , I think the person most concerned in this decision is the one who has not yet spoken  --  Loisy . I believe hers should be the deciding voice . " " I do not concur in that , " said Rea &; Loisy promptly . " Ours is a democratic body ; the majority must decide . Indeed , I do not think we as chiefs of staff have the right to determine our stand without consultation of our colleagues . My recommendation is that we place the entire question before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago , since our largest hall is in that city . We need not , if you think it undesirable , give them the exact details of our successful experiment . But IARC has for seventeen years been the most important body on earth . Every person connected with it is an eminent scientist in some field . Only a vote of the entire membership , together with a pledge of secrecy , which I am certain every one of them will keep , should determine whether humanity is to live or to die . I do not suggest that the matter should be put to a vote of all the people on earth ; I do not , and I know you do not , think that a valid opinion could be obtained except from people fully informed and , because of their lifelong scientific preoccupations , emotionally aloof  --  or at least relatively so . But my unchangeable belief is that only TARO as a whole should say the final word . " Renee Loisy 's proposal was adopted , and the meeting was held as arranged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers , Batak siding with Ramsdell . Many other of the world 's most famous biophysicists and biologists also spoke , together with several noted historians and economists whom the chiefs of staff had invited under special pledges of necessity and secrecy . World Government guards insured the complete privacy of the meeting , which lasted for an entire week . Groups of IARC members discussed and debated day and night . Finally , on May 7 , 1988 , the vote was cast . The ballots bore only two words , with a square after each for a registry by the voting-machines . The words were " Life " and " Death . " On the morning of May 8 , 1988 , which was a Sunday , the members of IARCgathered , in silent solemnity , to hear the results of their vote . Over the soundproof hall a religious hush prevailed as Joseph Callahan , chief of staff of their host city , stood before the microphone . " Comrades of IARC , " he said , " yesterday you cast 820 ballots . Previously you  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whatever the vote , the minority would obey it , and that if it were for the action recommended by Comrade Liu , each of us would forever keep the secret of the actual success of our researches , however strongly he or she might feel opposed to the decision . " Fellow-scientists , fellow men and women , the fate of the human race has been decided . By your ballots you determined whether mankind was to live or to die . " I shall now read the vote . " W HAT was the decision ? I can not tell you . As I write , it is not yet 1988 . Pastoral KATE BRACKETT TN THIS half-wild young field , how strange are sheep ; ? I Scattered some days like stones across the green ; And some days ( by what tides of light or air ? ) Turned all one way , like boats that lie asleep At anchor , or like worshippers at prayer . From clean square lines the cow 's firm belly swells ; Horses are packed with muscle , strung with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same As clustered rippling of the oldest hills ; The oldest boulders show these smooth-worn curves . Stepping high-heeled , capriciously , they lift Long tapered ears and meek Hebraic faces . Watching , I feel old England 's dampness creep ; See in the Cotswold dusk a huddled drift Of sheep along a road hedged in and deep ; Hear the sad fluting of the dreaming man , Shepherd in Ur five thousand years ago . His liquid notes still seek and slide along : And these were old when history began , The sheep , the dream , the sorrow and the song .
