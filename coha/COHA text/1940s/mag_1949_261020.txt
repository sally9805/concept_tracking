A congressional committee posed the question : What can the Government do to combat the recession ? Federal Reserve Loard Chairman Thomas B. McCabe , a Pennsylvania banker and businessman before he was a Government official , this week gave them a **26;9551;TOOLONG businessman 's answer . <P> Although President Truman , who appointed McCabe , has done plenty of talking about raising taxes , the FRB chairman 's remedy was just the opposite . The big trouble now , said Tom McCabe , was that there was a great shortage of risk capital , although " such risk taking has long been an American tradition . " Businessmen either did not have the cash or found investment too risky in the face of high taxes . The thing to do , he said , was to ease taxes on business and businessmen . McCabe recommended that Congress study the entire tax structure , and consider such changes as : <P> Reducing income taxes , particularly in the upper brackets , to make cash available for investment . <P> Eliminating double taxation of dividends ( they are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <P> Revising the tax exemption on local government securities , thus removing some of the benefits of buying municipal bonds instead of corporation stocks . <P> Liberalizing the " carry-back " and " carry-forward " tax provisions which enable businessmen to cut their business losses . <P> Allowing businessmen to speed up amortization , for tax purposes , of new plants and equipment , thus encouraging them to expand . <P> Revising , and perhaps liberalizing , the capital gains and losses regulations . <P> Liberalizing the restrictions now barring insurance companies from investing in common stocks . <P> If these changes were made , McCabe thought that business could step up expansion . Said he : " I am a confirmed optimist regarding the future of America . I firmly believe that the basic characteristics of our economy are expansion and growth . Economic expansion today presents a strikingly different challenge from that of a hundred years ago . Then , the frontier development was the opening up of our great Western resources . The geographic frontier is gone , but we still have a frontier of development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
