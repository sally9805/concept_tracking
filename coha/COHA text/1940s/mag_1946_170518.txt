LEARNING HOW TO BEHAVE ( 95 pp . ) <P> Arthur M. Schlesinger-Mocm/7/on ( $2 ) . <P> Harvard Historian Schlesinger* is almost apologetic about this busman 's holiday-a review of American books of etiquette from the 17th Century to the present day . " Nothing that concerns human beings can fail to concern the historian , " he wrote ; " the rise and progress of courtesy . . . deserves attention . " <P> Rough , religious Americans of the 17th Century had a handful of homemade rules of etiquette that were ambitious ( " Cloath your selves with the Silk of Piety , the Satin of Sanctity , the Purple of Modesty . . . " ) and sometimes blunt ( " Fish and visitors stink in three days " ) . By the 18th Century , they had learned to plagiarize the French and English rule-books , after carefully tossing out all that smacked of aristocratic cynicism . <P> Andrew Jackson 's entry into the White House-previously tenanted only by the " better people " - symbolized a sharp break from accepted manners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the new-rich were afraid that mere courtesy was not enough . Ostentation became the rule . Wrote one commentator : " Always keep callers waiting , till they have had time to notice the outlay of money in your parlors . . . . " <P> If It Bites , Say Nothing . But most etiquettists were deadly serious in wising-up social aspirants : " Do not seize ladies by the waist . " Never let your hostess " know that you have found . . . insects in your bed . " If you " throw down a waiter loaded with splendid cut glass . . . you should not . .. appear the least mortified . " <P> By the turn of the 19th Century , conversational ease had become a " hallmark of the elite . " Tasteful topics must be chosen , e.g. : " The conversation may gradually center on the Egyptian obelisk , or the Tower of London . " Some guides printed " model conversations . " Example : <P> The Gentleman : " We must be careful not to step on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , indeed , that would be a mishap . But trains are graceful in spite of their inconvenience . " <P> The Gentleman : " Oh , I admire them , of course . Only I have such a dread of stepping on them and bringing down the wrath of the fair wearer on my devoted head . " <P> Formality v. Courtesy . Schlesinger agrees with Emerson that " defect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions , " and holds that today 's abhorrence of snobbish formalities should not extend to contempt for simple courtesy . He finds promise of improved manners not so much in private homes as in public dealings : 1 ) in the businessman 's realization that courtesy increases dividends ; 2 ) in the wartime effort to make the G.I. respect the forms of citizens of other nations ; 3 ) in the basically polite approach of the Good Neighbor Policy . <P> <P> - Not to be confused with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. , his son , author of a Pulitzer Prize biography of Andrew Jackson : The Age of Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
