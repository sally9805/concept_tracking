They are n't revamped 1942 sets but sleek . new models featuring many of the improvements developed for the armed services . Two months after the industry has been given the green light for reconversion  --  expected as soon as Germany falls  --  new model radios will start rolling off assembly lines . Within four months every major company expects to be in production . Television sets will start moving out of factories six to nine months after reconversion . Prices-of the new radios will be substantially above 1941 levels , costing 15% to 50% more than they did in pre-war days . Prices of television receivers , never marketed in volume prior to the war . will range from $125 for the simplest table set up to $1,000 or more for luxury models . These are highlights of a ' Wall Street IJournal survey of major radio and television producers .

Manufacturers point gut that in order to assure equitable distribution among distributors and dealers they 'll have to parcel out their production until dealers are able to build up a backlog of sets . Here is a preview of what post-war receiving sets will be like .. Table models and personal radios will be more compact as manufacturers take advantinge of powerful smaller tubes that have ' been developed during the war . One firm plans to make a set , not much larger than a billfold , which will fit easily into a man 's coat pocket or woman 's handbag . Getting Its power from tiny batteries , it will be enclosed in wood or plastic cases . Sound receivers  --  they will be the first sets made  --  will offer better quality speakers . more durable tubes and condensers and streamlined cabinets Radios selling for more than $100 will be equipped for staticless frequency modulation ( F. M. ) in addition to standard broadcast reception . Prices Will Be 15% to 50% Higher As to prices of these sound sets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The extent of the increase will differ with each manufacturer . Balersoli Radio &; Phonograph Corp. , for example , which sold R. small table radio for $16 in 1941 estimates that a similar set will sell for $24 . Another maker which did a large business in console type sets in the $75 bracket . predicts these will cost around $90 . The higher prices for these radios , it is agreed , will stem from increased labor costs and the fact that the companies will have a hangover of wartime abnormalities of operation and supply As one executive put It " we 'll have to learn all over again how to operate on an economical basis " The long-awaited television sets , most radio men predict , wo n't start moving off assembly lines until about six to nine months after production gets under way . It will take that long , they point out , to tool up and get the necessary supplies . Big Initial Demand Expelled While there wo n't be a national market for television receivers for at least five years after the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the nine telecasting stations now in operation are located in heavily populated areas , Television programs now originate in New York , Philadelphia , Schenectady . Chicago and Los Angeles What will these television sets be like ' They 'll range from table models restricted solely to television to console combinations including standard broadcasting . FM , shortwave and a record player . How much will they Cost ? Table models , naturally , will be the cheapest . In this group . Philco Corp .. largest radio maker in the country , plans to offer a set giving just television sight and sound for $125 to $150 . A. feature of the Philco television receivers will be a flat-face picture tuba , known as the Plane-O-Scope . Most other manufacturers use R. curved surface tube to reproduce images . An important advantage claimed for this new tube , which was developed by Philco engineers , is that the picture can be viewed from any angle without suffering distortion . Philco executives say it also will improve the clarity of pictuies Screen Projection Model Planned The Emerson Radio &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television set for $150 . About 18 inches high and 14 inches wide . this set will project the picture from the rear onto a motion picture screen attached to the wall . It will use a three-inch cathode ray tube Ithe television picture tube ) and through the use of a system of lenses , will create a picture 18 inches by 24 inches . This set will also have a standard broadcast attachment . For about $200 , the Radio Corp . of Amer-ica ica will make a direct view model , creating a picture 81 , inches by 81 , inches . This set will also incorporate the standard broadcast feature . The General Electric Co. ' s model , which will sell for skghtly more than $200. will show a picture 7W3 inches by 91/2 Inches . This set will be good only for receiving television programs . having no standard band attachment . For console type television sets , makers indicate that prices will range anywhere from $225 to $800 , depending upon the number of features included . Some super-de luxe sets will retail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower end of the price range will offer either direct front-view pictures or images reflected from a mirror attached to the tilted lid of the cabinet . In either event , however , the picture will be no larger than tholie for the table models , averaging about 8 by 10 inches . One large company , for instance , which plans to start its console line at $300 will give a television picture 814 by 814 , inches . In addition , this set will include standard and FM broadcasting services . This company 's projection model , which will create a picture 18 by 24 inches , will sell for not less than $400 ? and probably more . While the industry is well aware that these prices will seem high to the buying public when compared with sound radios , they point out that the cost of the pre-war television set was much higher , ranging between $500 to $800 . They are confident , however , that as volume increases prices will come down even more . There would seem to be some justification for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were whittled down in the years before the war . in 1923. for MI/times , when volume production was just starting , the average price for a receiver was $270 . By 1936. however , when production had jumped to more than 8 million units , the average price had plummeted to $55 And in 1941 , the last full year of production , the average price for the approximately 13 million sets made was $35 Radio men warn , however , that the price of television receivers wo n't drop anywhere near as much as those of sound receivers . The television receiver , they point out , is an extremely complicated mechanism , embodying many more parts than a sound receiver . A direct view table model set with a 10'inch picture tube , for instance , requires about 20 tubes just for television and its accompanying sound . A projection type model would require about 28 tubes JUSt for television . The average sound receiver today has about five or six tubes . The story is the same for other parts . The number of condensers and resistors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 115 for each , depending upon the type of set . This compares with about 20 of each for a sound receiver . The most expensive single item in a television set is the picture tube , which before the war cost around $75 to $85 for a 12-inch tube . ' While manufacturers wo n't say definitely how much these tubes will cost after the war , they are hopeful that through mass production they v , ill be able to get them down to around $25 . Meantime . while waiting for the starting gun , manufacturers have surveyed the outlook for their Industry and have concluded that they face the busiest period in the 25-year history of the industry , They estimate there is a pent-up demand for about 25 million radios . Based on pre-war sales of about 10 million sets a year , this would mean that even if the industry could start off at full blast , which , of course , it so n't , it would take more than two years just to fill these needs . The biggest sales volume , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both television and sound , which before the war , it is estimated , accounted for about three quarters of all the sets sold . Of the balance , most of the business . It is anticipated , will be in **26;707;TOOLONG combinations . Heading the list of radio makers is the Philco Corp. , which for the period 3930 to 1942 made more receivers ( home and auto ) than any other company . Other prominent makers include Radio Corp , of America , Zenith Radio Corp .. Emerson Radio &; Phonograph Corp. , General Electric Co. , Majestic Radio &; Television Corp .. Farnsworth Television &; Radio Corp .. Crosley Corp. , Strombei g-Carlson , Galvin Mfg . Corp. , and Magnavox Co . Competing with these and other old line companies for the public 's radio dollars will be a group of newcomers who , having gotten into the electronics business as a result of the war , now plan to stay in it . One of these Is Bendix Aviation ? Corp. , which plans to make a complete line of home receivers . Westinghouse Electric &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has announced plans to re-enter the field .
