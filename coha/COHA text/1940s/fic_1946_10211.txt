much he loved her , how his whole life had changed since he had known her , how he would do something great in the world for her sake . " What are you doing on the stairs ? " he called almost angrily . And the spell was broken . Summer was the children'sworld . The minute the old car had backfired and roared its way down the driveway , the minute they had waved and heard the last bang and pulled the gate shut , the garden was theirs , the world was theirs , the summer world . They could pick cherries , or go for a walk in the forest , or out across the fields to the brickkiln or to one of the farms ; they could build secret houses in the trees . Francoise might pick one of her mixed bunches of flowers to paint and then take it up as an offering to her father 's study . Pierre might sneak up there and sit for hours on the floor reading books of philosophy and history . The day was theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small imperious gods , each with his special devotion , and , like the gods on Olympus , squabbling a good deal among themselves . But before they were quite free , each had his appointed task . The little ones ran up to help Bo-Bo make the beds . Francoise swept the downstairs rooms ( Lou-Lou was alone now , so the housework had been divided up ) . Pierre went to the kitchen to dry the dishes . He and Lou-Lou had long heart-to-heart talks about love ( Pierre was , if possible , more sentimental than she , so he made a sympatheticaudience ) and about Marxism . She could not tease him as all the Duchesnes did . She was properly impressed , even though she did n't understand what he was talking about and crossed herselfP101frequently . They were good friends , he and Lou-Lou . It eased his sense of inferiority to show off to her , and she felt that he was more her own kind than the Duchesnes . But this morning Lou-Lou was out of sorts . She called him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it did n't break . She behaved like a grownup who does n't want to be bothered with children . Pierre brooded on being called clumsy and tried to think of something that would make her pay attention to him . " What 's the matter with you this morning ? I bet it 's Jacques again ! " " You be quiet ! " she answered savagely . He had drawn blood with the first prick . Lou-Lou looked as if she were going to cry . She was not a handsome girl . She was strong and coarse-looking , but she had beautiful deep blue eyes set far apart , and her full bosom and air of sexual vitality , of great reserve energy in repose , was the sort to make boys whistle when she went past . More than anything she wanted to get married . But everything always seemed to go wrong . One young man had moved away and never answered her carefullycomposed sentimental letters . Another had left her when she refused to sleep with him , for Lou-Lou was a good Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was Jacques , whom she loved fiercely and wanted more than she had ever wanted anyone , so she bit her pillow at night and felt dizzy when she thought of him . " What 's the matter , does n't he love you any more ? " Pierre went on relentlessly and crudely , as only a fifteen-year-old boy avid of experiences he does n't understand can be crude and relentless . Lou-Lou burst into tears . She ran out into the court at the back and left him feeling very foolish , with the dish towel in his hand . " Oh well , women , " he said to himself . Lou-Lou was ashamed of herself . She washed her face at the pump and came back , dignified and silent . It was a shame to havep102given way before that silly fat little boy . What did he know about love ? " I 'm sorry , Lou-Lou , " Pierre murmured , blushing furiously . He would have liked to put an arm around her but he did n't know how , and he blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his great astonishment she slapped his face . " And keep your eyes where they belong ! " she said savagely . It was true , he had been looking at her breasts , but how did she read his thoughts like that ? What was happening to him ? Pierre would have liked to fall through the floor , vanish . Instead he dried the dishes meticulously , keeping his eyes fixed to each one as if his life depended on it . Lou-Lou was thinking , All men are the same . All they want is to lay hands on you , without love , without tenderness . What do they know about how a woman feels , she asked herself , about how a woman wants children , about how a woman wants a man , for life , for always , not dirtily under a bush for a thrill ? What did Jacques want of her , always laughing and teasing and trying to get her into a corner ? He thinks he 's too good for me , that 's it . " Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness . And Pierre was glad to go , glad to take refuge in his books up on the third floor , glad to be by himself and not to think . Or rather to think about the revolution and how he would be a hero when he grew up . But he was routed out by the little ones who ran up to get him to work in the garden . Croll came only two days a week now ; he was getting old , and the Duchesnes were having to cut down everywhereon expenses . Besides , the children were old enough to take on some responsibilities . They worked very hard in the garden . It was in the family tradition . They had watched their mother doing it for years , and they wanted to be like her . Sometimes Colette went quite white when they had finished carrying the pails for the evening watering , but this was morning and every-P103one full of energy . Even Solange for a little while worked quite hard , earning a word of praise from Francoise , who , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ; Well done , Solange . You can go and play now , " she said . " Pierre , you 're doing nothing  --  you have n't even got half through the row . Look at Colette 's row . " Pierre hated working in the garden . He was sweating already . The children had no respect for him . They were all as hard as nails and he was so white and soft . He was no good at games and cried when he lost . " I 'll help you , Pierre , " said Colette magnanimously . She had been reading Little Women and wanted more than anything at the moment to be good like Jo and Beth and Amy . And then she loved Pierre . He wanted to be a poet ; she never told him , because she did n't dare , but she had decided to be a poet too . She kept a little book of poems addressed to the fairies for whom she made nests and houses all over the garden . Colette believed in fairies with an unshakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a plum-tree fairy and a willow fairy with long green hair ; the goats knew it too . She had seen them shy when a fairy sat on their backs . Francoise felt happy this morning . She took one look at LouLouat breakfast and decided that something had gone wrong with Jacques . That was enough to make her feel happy . But then she was pleased with her painting of the daisies . The black had helped . And for once she felt eased of the struggle against her parents . Perhaps everything would be all right . The sun poured down on them . Pierre thought he would die if they did n't stop soon . He took off his shirt . Solange made up a song about weeding ; it turned into another about how fat Pierre was , and then she stopped because Colette frowned ; she stopped and dissolved in wicked , delighted giggles . Though there were only two years between her and Colette , she seemed like a baby , wanting nothing so much in the world as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At night she stroked and even sucked an old shawl which she would not be parted from . At seven she was having reading difficulties still . Everyone took it for granted that she would not be brilliant . She was just to be the darling , the cherished , the baby . It did n't matter whether she learned to read or not . That was Paul 's feeling , and even Melanie and Bo-Bo found themselves slipping into it . But Melanie wondered sometimes what she would become . Pierre sat down between the rows of carrots and wiped his face and neck with a huge handkerchief . It was really hot . Even the birds were quiet in the blaze of noon . The trees did n't stir . The air seemed to have a pulse , as waves of heat beat up from the earth . Francoise decided they had ( lone enough . The three girls ran panting to the willow and lay down on their backs under it , and Pierre finally pulled himself together and followedthem . For once they were all silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colette chewed a piece of grass thoughtfully . " Sale petit Boche , " said Solange in the tone of voice she had heard Lou-Lou use . They all laughed , and then they were silent . It was not quite nice somehow to hear Solange say those words . It made them feel uncomfortable . " Whatever you do , " Colette admonished earnestly , " you must n't say that to him . " But Solange had to try it once more . " Sale Boche , " she said again , with evident relish . " Stop it , Solange ! I 'll slap you . " It was clear that Francoise meant what she said . " Why does he have to come here in the first place , that 's what I want to know ? " Colette broke in angrily . To them all it seemed a menace , an end to their privacy and freedom . With Mamie away all day , they would have him on their hands . They would have to be polite.  | " His father is a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered in a very grown-up voice . " Besides , he 's a guest . He 'll have to behave himself . " " He 's a German . " " And just what is wrong with being a German ? " Pierre sat up . A pack of silly little girls , silly little bourgeoises , ignorant and prejudiced . Colette stopped chewing her piece of grass . Solange rolled over on her stomach and looked at him with amused indulgence . Francoiseresented his tone . " They 're the enemy , that 's all . They invaded Belgium in 1914 . " " They killed Lou-Lou 's mother and all her brothers and sisters , " Solange broke in excitedly . Pierre spat with conviction , with so much conviction that it reached all the way from where he was sitting to the path . For a moment they were so lost in admiration of this feat that they almost forgot what they were arguing about . " Old wives ' tales . Do you still believe all those atrocity stories ? Nothing but Allied propaganda . Everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of expansion , that 's all . Only Germany had the hard luck to want to expand after everyone else had grabbed the plums . " " They killed Lou-Lou 's mother , " said Solange . She was in a rage . " They killed Lou-Lou 's mother , " she screamed at him , standing up and stamping her foot . " I hate the Germans  --  hate them  --  hate them , " she chanted . She was red in the face . " All right , you hate them , " he said wearily . But when she had quieted down , he went on . " You 're an ignorant little puss , " he said , tickling her leg with a piece of grass . Solange giggled before she had time to remember she was angry , and regretted it at once . " I do n't care what you say , " she said , lifting her head a moment and then burying it in her arms , " when Hans comes I 'm going to put a frog in his bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " said Colette grimly . Everything seemed all mixed up and difficult and sad all at once . The day was spoiled . She felt ashamed of Solange but she could n't decide just why . She was only repeating what she heard . But it had sounded horrid . " Are n't you ever going to forget the past ? " Pierre asked earnestly . " Ca n't you see we 'll never get anywhere in this . Godforsaken little country unless we 're part of something bigger , unless we work with people everywhere all over the world for the revolution ? " For once they were too absorbed by his own conviction to pick up the word " revolution " and fling it at him . The revolution was Pierre 's King Charles 's Head . " The Left is stronger in Germany than it is anywhere else in the world . They are our best friends . Jaures knew that . Jaures believed in the German working people . If he had lived --  " " Who was Jaures ? " Colette asked . She always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . It bored her . And now he would go on for hours . " Jaures , my child , was the great French socialist and labor leader . If he had lived , there would have been no war . " Francoise had had enough . She got up and yawned . " Where are you going ? " He was talking to and for Francoise . Colette was too young to understand these things . " If you listened to me once in a while you might learn something . " " I 'm not interested in politics . " " What are you interested in ? " " Art , " she said crisply , and walked away , her head high , looking very handsome and self-assured . But Pierre was not to he pushed aside . " Art , art , " he called as he got up heavily and trotted after her . " My God , Franci , who 's going to have a chance to be interested in art or anything else if we have another war ? " " Another war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was infuriating , illogical . " You 're impossible . I do n't know why I bother to talk to you . "  | " Why do you ? " They were standing under the arbor at the front door now . " I hate you , " he said passionately . " All you Duchesnes . You think you know everything . I hate you ! I hate you ! " he shouted as she went in and closed the door behind her . The day was spoiled beyond repair . Colette gave it up . She felt tired . Why did they always pull at each other ? Why could n't they ever sit and talk quietly like grown-up people ? And then she rememberedeven grown-up people could n't talk about these things quietly . The fairies never argued or got angry . They were always very quiet and happy , living their lives . She would go now and make a bower for a fairy out of marguerites . She would weave a tiny little crown for a fairy and leave it in a secret place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cherry tree . Melanie never got usedto the wonders of having a car , a little flying sofa on which she and Paul sat every morning whisking through the cool green alleys of trees , coming out into the great lawns and the artificial lakes of the park , watching the sun filter its way through shining layers of leaves  --  all green , all light , all shadow . Brussels never looked so beautiful as early in the morning when they turned out of the forestinto the great avenues : servants were out flinging pails of water down the stone steps , washing the sidewalks ; all the windows shone in the light ; the city seemed to have an airy elegance , to be made all of light and space . But it was , after all , an intimate elegance , the elegance of a provincial drawing room where one was well known . Sometimes they saw the King out for his morning ride , looking like a kindly professor ; this sight , so familiar to thousands of citizens who smiled and said , " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a good view , seemed the very signature of home . There was the King , at home in his capital , loved , honored , taken for granted . People felt happy seeing him ride past . All was well . All over the city people were getting ready for business , the waiters taking the chairs off the tables , the florists unpacking basketsof flowers to set up on the small street stands , the tobacconists standing in their doorways waiting for customers , and Melanie 's heart sang to be part of the city , to be part of this innocent gay morning world . Always , every morning , she had the feeling that something wonderful might happen . She ran to open the mail , convinced that there would be good news . It was absurd to be so optimistic , she knew , but she felt happy . How could she help it ? It was ever so much better to have the weight of the big house off their shoulders . And then Paul was with her now . Paul would be upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big drawingboard , whistling , reciting poetry under his breath . They had never been so close . They had never been less in love , perhaps that was why . " He 's my good friend , my dear , " she thought happily . Would it be like this always ? Had they really come to port ? Summer meant a lull in business and a chance to catch up . Melanie had time to draw up inventories , make plans , time to breathe and enjoy , time to run upstairs and see how Paul was getting on , time to do the show window herself . There was nothing she liked better . In the smaller place there was more intimacy between the Duchesnes and the people who worked for them than there had ever been . Melanie brought cold lunch in a hamper from the country , and Paul sometimes went out and got a bottle of beer , or the Jeans brought up hot soup or coffee , and the whole family gathered for an informal picnicky lunch in Paul 's studio . Sometimes friends dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theater , and an old friend . The business felt ten years younger in the new place . They were n't making any money , but who cared ? As long as they could keep going , times were bound to change.  |p109Every  day palaces were going up in the Avenue des Nations , embassies , great houses built by rich importers from the Congo . There were big orders just around the corner , and meanwhile what fun to be making a window , all blue and white with the modern pewter Melanie had invested in . " Hand me the big platter , mademoiselle . See , that will just do it . " Melanie was so busy and pleased with what she was doing that she did n't notice Mademoiselle 's monosyllabic answers . Mademoisellehad arrived very late and been properly scolded . Perhaps she was still a little upset . When Melanie climbed out of the window and back into the shop , a little out of breath with the effort , she turned to her and said , " Allons , am I forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Friends ? " " That 's better , " she said as Mademoiselle shook her outstretched hand . But now she had a chance to look her in the eyes , it was clear that something was wrong . That man again , I suppose , Melanie thought angrily . Mlle. Louvois had been living for years  --  everyone knew about it  --  with one of the big couturiers in Brussels . And for years she had been going through one crisis after another , incurably romantic , incurably sentimental . She was getting older . She wore too much make-up . Her hair had gotten a brighter and brighter red . It could n't go on forever . And what was to become of her then ? When the bell tinkled and a shy young girl came in to ask if by chance they needed another salesgirl or typist , Melanie talked to her to give Mademoiselle a chance to pull herself together . And soon Melanie was making all sorts of promises , calling up friends , determined to get the child a job . Paul was reciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had arrived at his favorite passage : " Ils tracent dans fair leur cercle eblouissant , Mais it y Pend toujours quelque goutte de sang , "  |p110he  declaimed , surrounded by little pots of paint and the fine Japanesebrushes he used for his designs . Something in Paul 's voice and the majesty of the poem , its grandioseself-pity , broke down all Mlle. Louvois 's defenses . She did not want to cry . It would ruin her make-up . But she could n't help it . Paul was never surprised by violent emotion . It was so evidently there in everyone , just under the skin , waiting to leap out . Looking into people 's eyes as they walked along the street , he saw it  --  murder , despair , violence , just under the skin . " The beautiful and the mondaine like you , mademoiselle , should never cry , " he said quietly without moving toward her . Curious creature , he was thinking . This is what happens when a woman imagines that love can be everything . " Idiot ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost . There was no stopping the tears of shame , of despair , the ugly female tears , the tears of the betrayed . They tore at her face and through her whole body as if they had claws . Paul nodded his head sadly . Poor woman . Poor woman , he thought , and he came round and sat on the arm of the chair oppositeher . " Tell me the whole story , old friend , " he said kindly . " We 've been through a lot together here . Tell me , " he said , pouring out a little glass of brandy from the cupboard and handing it to her . The brandy nearly choked her , but then it crept through her veins like consolation . She looked at him with great grateful eyes , still full of tears . " Oh , monsieur . " But little by little the story came out , the petty sordid story of the middle-aged man tired of his mistress , keeping her on out of pity , going to see her once a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl to work for him , going to bed with her . Old old story , Paul thought . And yet it was not like that . Because at the bottom of it was the helpless , devouringneed to love , to love through everything and in spite of everything , beyond humiliation , beyond despair . Only children and thep111very old know this love , understand it , love naked without hope , without anything to sustain it , without anything to help it through the bad times as marriage does , as physical passion does  --  the impossible , Paul was thinking . And against his thoughts the broken , childish counterpoint of Mademoiselle 's story poured out . " I know I am getting old and ugly , " she said harshly , " but I love him . I have loved him for twenty years . Does that count for nothing ? He 's not young himself . He wo n't find a young girl who can love him as I do  --  we have all our lives behind us  --  the things we remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That would be true if you were his wife , my poor Louise . " She made a gesture of abnegation . She blew her nose . " I know , " she said simply and with dignity . Paul was a comfort to people just because his view of life was pessimistic , because he was never surprised or indignant . He was comforting because he suggested that there was nothing to do but accept . The outward change would not happen , so the inward change was necessary . He could be truly objective , as if at such moments there were no blood in the mind , as if it were crystalclearand crystal-cool , a machine for calculating human emotion , not feeling it . " You must go on loving him . " " I ca n't help it , " she said quietly . " But you can not expect him to come back , to be the same , to change now . He wo n't change . Because in the absolutely pure abstract sense there is no such thing as enduring love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes ; no two people ever stay at the point of romantic love forever  --  but that is where you have wished this to stay , where it had to be to exist at all . It was love in a vacuum . " " But then , " she asked passionately , " what 's the meaning ? What is it all for ? " " Ah , my poor Louise , that you have to answer for yourself . The meaning is in you . After all , for you it is the same as it always was.  |p112For  you it is there , as it always was . It is he who has lost you , lost all he felt for you , and that is a great loss . He has lost his youth , his constancy  --  he has lost the meaning . " Outside the window a flock of white pigeons wheeled and turned and settled one by one on the ridge of a red-tiled roof . Paul and Louise both turned at this rush of movement in the air outside and watched them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had laid down a great burden she had been carrying alone . And she turned from the pigeons , from the blue air outside , to Paul and looked at him with a sort of wonder . Madame was lucky to have such a husband . He would never falter . He would never change . " What is it , Louise ? " he asked gently , seeing the mask of sufferingclose down again over her face which had looked so pure , so serene a moment before . Jealousy , the most degrading human emotion , what did one do with that ? For the physical images which Paul 's gentle words had dissipated had seized her again . Horror and degradation . And all that had been pure and violent between her and Charles turned to something filthy . For the first time in her life Mademoiselle used an ugly word . " Ah yes , ah yes , they 're not easy , these little tortures we set ourselves to suffer , to surpass . We live through them  --  we shut our eyes and grit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are sensitive , aware like you , we open our eyes and stare at them , stare at them until we have seen and understood everything , examined it , possessed it . The possession of physical suffering in silence , in acceptance , that is something . And do you think that a single human being lives through his life without some horror , some humiliation , some ache in the flesh , some such torture ? Nonsense , we 're all on the rack in one way or another . " What can he have suffered , she wondered bitterly , with his wife and three beautiful daughters , his whole natural life ? Not , like her , shut away from all normal joys and sorrows , shut into this prison where the light was never turned off , where one must endure the blaze night and day , day and night.  | " No , " she said sharply , " you do n't know  --  you ca n't know and then , catching herself up , " I 'm sorry , monsieur . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look into people 's lives . Look into anyone 's life . There is always a nightmare somewhere . " He was standing at the window looking out . What would he say next ? Where was he leading her ? " Yours ? " she asked . For a moment she thought he had n't heard . He stood so still looking out . Then he gave a little bitter laugh , a mocking laugh , and came over and sat down opposite her . " Mine ? To be a failure . What do you think ? " His voice had turned to acid , all the gentleness gone out of it . " To be caught between two worlds without the strength to live fully in either  --  to want the purest possible life , to want to live in and for the idea , to want to go far out where no one has ever been , into the stratosphere  --  and to want to be understood , to be listened to , to be published , what ? To be a success  --  yes , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit it : to want those second-rate barterers and grocers , the publishers and editors to want my commodity , to want what I have to sell . Idiotic , is n't it ? And the result , mademoiselle  --  " He got to his feet and walked up and down , now as if he were enjoying himself , like an actor on a stage , playing some dramatic scene of self-revelation for her ; and she thought . They 're all children really . Even he . What a child he seemed to her suddenly , what a boy . " The result , " he went on  --  " that I am nothing , a poor father , a poor husband  --  yes , I am , inconsiderate , selfish  --  and a bad philosopher . Ah , you do n't know what it is to come here day after day and feel satisfied when I have made an adequate design for a desk , to see the gratitude in my wife 's eyes because now at last after all these years I am of some use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the same time to know that I am compromising what I really mean , that I am getting farther and farther from thep114life I meant to have , from the things I meant to do  --  " He stopped and went back to his desk and stood there leaning on it looking at her . He had never looked at her before , and for one moment their eyes met and each shivered with the contact as if each had seen more than he meant to see , given more than he knew he was giving . Melanie came in . " Where is everybody ? " she asked , looked from Paul to Mlle. Louvois and understood at once what had been happening . Paul will have been comforting her , she thought gratefully . He always knows what to say . " It 's time for lunch , my children , and we have a most delicious potato salad , if I say so myself  --  and cold ham which Jean somehowinveigled out of his friend down the street . " She sat down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Allons , mademoiselle , un peu de courage ! " she said with that commanding warmth they all depended on . Mademoiselle , who felt she had been carried way out into some new sphere , saw the familiar world click back into place again . When Hans finallycame early in August and turned out to be brown and fair and shy , they all loved him at once . Melanie had always wanted sons . Now she called Pierre and Hans " My two boys , " and if she had asked them to do some heroic act they would have been overwhelmed with happiness ; as it was , Hans worked like a beaver in the garden , waiting at the gate for her to come home , longing for a word of praise , homage in his heart . Pierre wrote her rhapsodic poems in Flemish addressed to some heroic earth-goddess whom Melanie did not recognize as herself . Back from the office in the evening , surrounded by her troop ofp115children , Melanie felt : This is how life should be , standing barefootedby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was handed on to Solange and then to Francoise and then to Pierre and finally to Hans , who poured it over the cabbages one by one , and then the carrots , the onions , the beans . It was hot . They were all tired after the day . But the rhythm of arms swinging the pails , the heat , the laughter , all had the air of happiness over them . How lucky they were to live in the country , to be a houseful of children , to be safe , to have drawn the magic circle of home around them  --  this was the only security that mattered , the security of love , the security of the family  --  beside it the peril and insecurity of the business , the way in which they could go on , send the children to university , pay the bills , was a small light peril . With one 's bare feet touching the cool hard earth in the garden , it seemed quite unreal . With the air full of " Hurry up , Mamie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans at the pump , all move up one ! " or " Oh , Mamie , I 'm too out of breath , do n't make me laugh , " from a small , red-faced , giggling Solange who held everything up while she dropped her pail . The children did not examine happiness . They lived in it as fish live in water . It was splashing water from the pump over your body when you were hot . It was the lovely relaxed tiredness of finishingthe job and lying down on the grass , feeling your heart pumping violently all through your body . It was hunger and waiting for the supper bell . To Solange it was the gold hairs on Hans 's hard brown arms . It was summer and friendship and home . It was Papa throwing open his window and leaning out to call down a greeting . And to Hans it was superlatively the Duchesnes , all of them , all of them together and the house and the garden and the goats and the ducks . At home everything felt very still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not make them out . Their business seemed to be going on the rocks , and nobody cared . They were familiar with servants ; they did their own work , and yet theyp116behaved like aristocrats . They did n't seem to want anything they did n't have . They did n't worry all the time . And they talked so much about everything , things he had never heard talked about : Lou-Lou 's love affairs , history , the characters of all the children . Everyone was treated with respect , as if his opinions mattered , even the children 's . Everyone seemed to be responsible for himself . More than anything , none of them seemed afraid . It was that , perhaps  --  theabsence of fear . What made it ? And why was it so differentat home ? " Hans , hurry up , you 'll be late for supper ! " He went in slowly . " Our engineer is late , " Mamie teased as she ladled out the soup from a great tureen . With such a large family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their meals in the big formal diningroom , cool and delicious in summer , looking out into the French garden . " Our engineer is taking his time . " He had told them his dreams of being a dam builder , of going to America to study the great new dams there . So now he was the engineer and Pierre the poet . Mamie behaved as if they were alreadyestablished in their professions . She talked to them seriously about literature , about engineering , as if they were men . " What shall we have after supper , children , Nils Holgersson or poems ? Papa said he would read . " " Poems , poems ! " they shouted like birds opening their mouths and vociferously calling for worms . Solange would fall asleep , of course ; she always did . It was still a little difficult for Hans to follow French poetry , and sometimes they asked him to read from Goethe and Schiller . Or Pierre would bring downstairs his precious Karel van de Woestyne , the great Flemish poet , and defy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes Colette curled up beside Hans and leaned her head on his shoulder . Then he stopped breathing , he was so happy . The magic circle really closed around him . He was inside.  |p117Pierre  's fierce defense of Germans seemed triumphantly vindicated . For was n't Hans a German they could all love ? And did anyone even remember how they had talked that afternoon two weeks before ? He himself , plunged into this new atmosphere , still tingling with the shock of it , like a diver changing from one element to another , responding to the shock of water , had had no time yet to catch his breath . He was simply splashing around happily in a new life . He listened ; he observed ; he adapted himself so that he might become as much as possible a Duchesne . He had the lover 's madness , the wild desire to please , and the special awareness which made it easy to please . The summer seemed an enchantment , and his lettershome were long paeans of praise , " Today we cleared out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into the muck ; yesterday we went for a long walk to the big farm . These farms are built around a court and all the manure piled up in the middle , but the peasants are good people , though I do n't know how they can stand the smell . " . . . " Today I had a long argument with Pierre about Marxism ; he has read a great deal ; he talks about Rosa Luxemburg  --  could you send me a book about her ? " . . . " Today Tante Melanie said I had cut the hedges very well ; it was a hard job and my wrists are sore from holding the big shears . I am learning a lot here . " . . . " Colette showed me a poem today . It was very good . She is a funny little girl ; she believes in fairies ; she looks like Greta Garbo ; she seems very old and very young at the same time . I think she is a genius . " ... " I have gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , often talked about Hans and his parents . Melanie especially held him up as an example of a well-brought-up boy , disciplined , able to handle himself , and compared him with Pierre , the always-late , lazy individualist , selfish and spoiled . " Of course Pierre is an intelligent boy , " she would add , " but what a pity that Emile and Suzanne have no idea how to bring him up . "  | But as the long , hot August days shimmered on the edge of autumn , as the grass turned brown except under the trees , and every now and then the heavy thud of an apple falling startled the goats , and the terrifying summer storms began , the tension in the air , playing on the children 's nerves , changed the honeymoon atmosphere they had lived in for weeks . It was nothing tangible  --  Solange still climbed up onto Hans 's lap and whispered secrets in his ear ; Colette brought him her poems ; Pierre and he went for long walks , arguing about politics and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long bout of painting every day for hours , so she had by the end of August a whole set of flower pieces , so beautiful that Mamie had them framed and hung in the dining room . Everything seemed the same and they did not know themselves what was happening . But there were tiny incidents . One day Hans found Croll evening up the hedge he had clipped a few days before himself . Lou-Lou in the kitchen heard him shout at the old man , " Stop that , you old fool . That 's my job . I did it last week , " saw Croll obstinately shake his head and go on quietly . For anyone could see the pure line of the hedge was gone . It must be flat as a table , cut with an unerring eye and knowing hands . She stood in the kitchen window with her hands on her hips and saw the whole scene played out , saw Hans snatch the shears out of the old man 's hands and stamp his foot . She had been waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she was glad . She ran out , her sabots clattering on the stone court . She would show that little Boche how decent people behaved . " Do something else . The hedge is my job . " Hans was standing imperiously before the helpless old man like a young troll , on fire with pride and anger , brandishing the shears . Lou-Lou walked up to him and slapped his face , took the shears out of his hands , and gave them back to Croll . " Do n't pay any attention to the boy , Croll. "  | " Who do you think you are ? " Hans was blazing now with anger and humiliation . " How dare you touch me ? " " Here in this house we do n't treat anyone as you just treated that old man , " she said , and walked off . " You 're nothing but a servant . I 'll tell Madame , " he shouted helplessly after her . But this was too much . Lou-Lou came back and faced him . " Oh , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . She 'll be furious ; Croll has worked here for twenty years . No one has the right to speak to him as you did  --  or to me either , for that matter . Go ahead and tell her , you little " She paused here as if she could n't quite bring out the word . " You little German ! " she said with pure hatred . So that 's how they really feel , Hans thought , burning with shame , with anger . So that 's how they really feel ! It seemed then suddenly as if all the happiness of the last weeks were a sham , a beautiful stage-set put up for his benefit over the reality  --  hatred . He went up to his room and walked up and down , cursing . Of course Tante Melanie would take Lou-Lou 's side . Was n't she a Belgian ? Were n't they all Belgians ? But when Melanie and Paul came home , Lou-Lou did n't tell them . Nothing was said . Nothing had changed . Everyone loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants behaved that way , well , they were servants . Who cared about them ? He and Lou-Lou avoided each other , and that was that . Lou-Lou had n't told Madame because she was a little ashamed herself , but she told Pierre , and Pierre was shocked . Hans was his friend . Well , perhaps it was the heat and he had lost his temper . Anyone might do that , Pierre reasoned , but he found himself observingHans with a new detachment , wondering about him  --  perhaps a little glad in spite of himself to discover the flaw in everyone 's hero , to guess that there might be a flaw . Pierre and Uncle Paul were always having long discussions aboutp120Belgium , and one evening when they had sat outside under the apple trees until it was quite dark , they were deep in argument . The little ones had long since gone to bed . For once Francoise was sittingleaning against her father , enjoying the coolness , pleased with herself and the world . Hans lay on his back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure of Bo-Bo moving back and forth from the window , half listening as Uncle Paul 's voice rose and fell , a human accompaniment to the steady song of the crickets . At first it had astonished Hans  --  now he had grown accustomed to this constant criticism of one 's own country , " dense , heavy little country , " as Uncle Paul called it , " narrow provincial little country . " Now he was talking again : " Do n't you see , Pierre , that your Flemish movement is only an exacerbated provincialism , the apotheosis of provincialism ? Culturallyno one denies its reality and its importance . Politically it just does n't make sense . It 's a little like the Catholic Church  --  as long as you look at it as a mystical experience it is all very well . No one wants to deny anyone their little ecstasies . But the minute it becomes a political power , a political power which must by its very nature defend property , defend privilege , it is simply a menace and must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I can not see as practical anything which divides the country  --  the proof is how useful it was to Germany during the war . Who made the University of Ghent into a Flemish-speaking university ? The Germans , " said Uncle Paul with a shrug . In the grass , where he had lain so relaxed , Hans began to listen attentively , the hair on his neck prickling . Germany , Germany , would they never stop thinking and talking about Germany ? " Just because Germany used a strong inner compulsion , used what was already there , does n't mean it was bad . I do n't see that , " said Pierre , warming to the argument . " No , but the fact remains that many Belgians , because of their being partisans of one group within the country against another ,  |p121found  themselves playing the German hand . And that , I suggest , is a weakness . " " Well , a great many Belgians now play the French hand or the British hand , and that seems to me just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . " " They happen to be civilized peoples , my dear Pierre . " They had forgotten Hans for once . " And we , you infer , are not civilized ? Is that it ? " His voice came up at them out of the dark icily . " Well , " said Paul gently ( he had no desire to make anyone unhappy ; it was far too peaceful an evening ) , " well , you were never conquered by Rome , you know . " Hans sat up . " And you 're proud of that ? " " Perhaps it civilized us , " Paul answered gently , yawned , and got up to go . They wo n't even talk to me , that was what flashed through Hans 's mind . I 'm a barbarian to them . The hot , helpless anger flowed through him . I hate them all , he thought bitterly . He had never really been in the magic circle . They had never really includedhim , only pretended to . All the time they held themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . I love them . It is n't fair , he said , feeling intolerably lonely now everyone had gone in and left him , even Pierre . They were there in the lighted house going quietly to bed , clothed in righteousness , and he was outside , lying in the grass in the dark , in the wrong . A German . What did it mean to be a German ? Suddenly he wanted to go home , go back to his father and mother , to the quiet house in Frankfort , to be safe from criticism , from doubt . To be a German again and proud of it . But when he went upstairs to bed he met Melanie coming from the bathroom in her wrapper and he flung his arms around her and held her so tight she laughed . " You 'll strangle me , Hansche . " " I love you , " he said in a strained , thick voice . She rumpled his hair back and looked at him tenderly . " Of course you do . I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family . Run along now to bed , " she said , pushing him gently , with just the simple authority in the touch of her hand which could heal any child . It was something in the air . They felt the difference , the slight hostility around them , nobody 's fault , nobody 's intention . But there it was . All except Melanie . She refused to believe such things . Hansche was her own boy , the faithful worker in the garden , and she hated to think of his leaving . Paul made an effort now to draw Hans into their discussions . He even asked him and Pierre to come up sometimes into his sacred study and listen to the radio . And one evening he made a great effort to get Munich , so that they could hear Adolf Hitler giving a pre-election speech . " I 'd like to hear him once  --  he must be a very powerful orator , " Paul had said at dinner . But he was out of temper before they finally got through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys sat on the floor ; Paul bent over the radio , testing dials and cursing quietly . " Ca n't we just hear Big Ben first ? " Melanie asked innocently . That was what she liked best of all , to hear Big Ben ring over the air , making England seem so close . Better than any words . Solid and safe . But Paul answered irritably , " I 've been trying for half an hour to get through to Munich  --  There , at last , " he said , settling down to listen as a Strauss waltz burst on them loudly . Melanie vanished into the hall to waltz happily by herself . " It 's just ten . He 'll be on in a minute . " Hans waited eagerly for the German voice . He was thrilled thinking of Munich . He had heard his family discussing Hitler contemptuously , but he had not been particularly interested until now . They did n't know anything about politics , his feeling was  --  and at school one of his best friends was an ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full force of the German languageused as a spellbinder , traveling through the night to all the corners of Germany and even here to find a solitary boy sitting on the floor of a Belgian house . With a movement of sudden shyness before the force of his own emotion , Hans slid over to where he was hidden behind the desk and no one could see him . " We are not , have never been , defeated . This is the beginning of a new Germany  --  Germany is great . Germany is powerful  --  Ger-many  --  Germany  --  Germany  --  " Hans was tingling all over . The tears came to his eyes . Germany . The thing to fight for , to die for . Who could understand the flood of love , of passion that the word " Germany , " as it was shouted by that voice of a people , could do to a German ? It was life pouring in , breaking over like a great wave . Beside the shock of it , the exhilaration , the long intellectual arguments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was wine , intoxication , power . His life , his power . " Paul , I ca n't stand this . What ranting ! " Melanie went off to bed in disgust . This is not Germany speaking , she thought , just some madman , some hysteric who will be defeated in the election . It was too wild and fantastic to be taken seriously . Paul smiled . It was interesting psychologically . The man undoubtedlyknew how to talk to Germans . After a moment , curious to see its effect on Hans , Paul got up and looked behind the desk . He was met by a flushed excited face , the glare of tear-filled eyes , which blazed at him defiantly , as if to say , " This may be funny to you . But to me it 's deathly serious . " Pierre too was fascinated . And yet there was a striking difference in the two boys ' faces . Pierre was judging what he heard . He frowned as he concentrated with the effort to understand each sentence in a foreign language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul for his reaction . And he was eager to discuss the whole thing with Hans when at last it was over . He called over to the desk gaily :  | " Well , Hans , what chance has he got ? Tell us the worst . " Hans shook his head like a dog shaking off water . What had Pierre asked ? He felt ashamed of his emotion , ashamed and exhausted . It seemed unreal now , a sort of nightmare . " Of course the man is a fanatic , " he said condescendingly . But inside him a voice seemed to answer , You are betraying Germany when you say that . He was upset . He wanted to be alone , and , leaving them to wonder what was going on inside him , he went upstairs to bed . But there , lying in bed , he had the sensation that his bed was a ship and he was sailing away very fast , sailing away from everythinghere , but he wanted to stay . He did n't want to go . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have time to think , to be himself . " This is all nonsense , " he said , getting up and turning on the light as if to banish a ghost . " The man will never be elected . That 's impossible . All reasonable people like my parents will be against him . How could I have been so moved by a screaming hysteric ? " He took down a volume of Rilke 's poems and after reading here or there , as if to find a talisman , touch it , and go on , he fell asleep . Downstairs Paul was writing to Schmidt . What did he think about a speech like that ? How many people would take it seriously ? What was happening in Germany ? In spite of himself he felt a deep anxiety , and a pen and a piece of paper seemed poor things with which to try to pierce the darkness . The letter ended : You must come here for a visit soon . I simply must talk to you , old friend  --  in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this old Europe . Your son has given us great pleasure . He is charming , intelligent , and , as Melanie constantly says , " so well brought up . " But I was interested and perhaps a shade alarmed to see what a powerfuleffect Adolf Hitler 's speech made on him . Is there much talk of National Socialism . among his school friends ? Surely we are not going to become the slaves of incantations and witch doctors ? Your faithful oldPAULp125For once Melanie wassitting on the back seat because they were taking Francoise to town for the day and she was sitting on the front seat with her father . It was still early enough for the coolness to be in the air , and it flowed past like water , bathing their faces , in the open car . There they were just ahead of her , her husband and her eldest , their voices lost in the roar of the motor , so there seemed an invisiblebarrier between her and them , as if they were faces on a screen and she an audience watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them . Franrcoise had wedged herself as far to the right as she could and was looking out coolly , not givingher father an inch ; Paul was evidently talking to her tenderly , consolingly , drawing her to him with the magnet of his love , saying , " Open to me , " wooing this elder daughter of his , as he was always impelled to woo every female creature of whatever age . How can she resist him ? Melanie wondered in admiration . I never could . But from the time she was a little girl Francoise had resisted her father , resisted and fought her way out of the net of tenderness he flung over her , tore her way out fiercely over and over again , would not be touched . That was it , Melanie said , a fierce chastity ; against it Paul 's desire to possess a soul , to penetrate to the very inmost core of a person , seemed a sort of rape . Who would win in the end ? Could it go on forever ? Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had noticed it before : the end of summer is a dangeroustime . The children were getting on one another 's nerves . Solange had a tantrum the other day over nothing at all ; Colette looked listless and tired ( was she suffering already at Hans leaving next week ? ) . There was emotion in the air , in the dusty leaves , in the screams of the birds . And then Lou-Lou . Lou-Lou was becoming a problem . She wasp126obviously head over ears in love with Jacques , but did he want to marry her ? Was there anything in it besides the gossip of the little ones ? Lou-Lou would make a devoted wife , and she was a good girl , responsible , honest , but Melanie had a queer feeling that the last thing Jacques wanted was a devoted wife . He was charming ; he was an excellent worker . Monsieur Plante could hardly do withouthim at the shop . And yet what was it about Jacques ? He never seemed quite grown-up though he was nearly thirty  --  as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where nothing would grow , as if he had learned to live on air because the root was blasted . But Lou-Lou could not live on air , on charm , on flirtation . Passionate , reserved  --  she waited . She suffered . She looked bruised , like a fruit stained by its own ripeness ; it was time she married . I must have a talk with Jacques , Melanie thought . So she surveyed her world , in the morning , on the way to the business , on this late August day . She was sending Francoise over to M. Plante 's to look at a children 's chest that she had decided to let her decorate : her first real job . The car slowed down and stopped , and they all poured up the back stairs laden with packages . Then Francoise had to be greeted , embraced , told how lovely she looked by the two demoiselles . She did look lovely in a raspberrycoloredlinen dress , her eyes shining . One wanted to pop a raspberryinto her mouth and make her smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someday she would be the patronne ; she would run the business . This was taken for granted by everyone . It had always been inevitable , as if she were the crown princess of a reigningdynasty . The business had gone down from mother to daughter , and so it would proceed . Francoise herself had no doubts about this and no conflict . It was what she wanted too . So that every time she came into town she was looking ahead at her kingdom . She plied everyone in sight with questions . She liked nothing better than to be given a job , sorting samples out  --  or best of all to go with her mother to some client 's house and be asked her own opinion about curtains , colors , textures.  |p127But  today was even better than the usual days and more exciting . Today she was on her own . Today she would have a chance to do something original , to be entirely responsible . Her head was full of birds and flowers and arabesques of trees , of elephants and monkeysand all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big toy box for a child . " There , my big girl . Now run along . M. Plante is expecting you  --  only be back for lunch at twelve . " Melanie gave her a kiss and turned back to her desk . " Only no flirting with that handsome friend of yours , " Paul called maliciously after her . Francoise ran down the stairs blushing . Her father was uncanny . How did he know ? How had he found out ? It was terrible to have such a father . Yes , Jacques would be there . And for the first time she was armed . She was going there as Melanie 's daughter , as an artist , as a part of the business . She did not even have to talk to him . He would see how grown-up she was and how serious and how little time she had for him . But oh , it was a queer thing to have one 's knees go back on one like this . She stopped to look in at the lingerie , salmon-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Francoise looked at each strangely impersonal piece of feminine underwear . What would it be like to have a lover ? No , she said to herself , as if she were closing a door firmly , and walked on . People turned to watch her go past  --  the long swinging stride , something selfabsorbed , splendid  --  wondered who she was , where she was going  --  not today , but in the end , for life . " Ah , mademoiselle . " M. Plante bowed as he opened the door to her . He was a little old man and he wore a green shade to protect his eyes . " Come in . We are waiting for you . You will see what a beautiful job we have done for you . " Francoise hardly listened . She was intoxicated by the smell of wood and chips and sawdust , by the steady hum of a mechanical saw and the sweet shrill scrape of a plane . Carpenters have blue eyes , she thought idiotically , for M.p126Plante did indeed have very clear pure blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . She looked at everything and was disappointed that much of it seemed ugly . Did her mother really have to sell things like that to make a living ? Out of the corner of an eye she saw Jacques bending over a workbench , doing something that required great concentration . He did n't look up . Was he even aware that she had gone past ? M. Plante noticed the shadow that had fallen like a curtain over her face . " Mademoiselle is not pleased ? " " Oh yes , " she breathed , and knelt down to open the doors . It was all just as she had dreamed it would be , with a secret drawer at the back and a leaf that slipped out to make the chest into a desk . " It is beautiful . " M. Plante nodded his head and ran his hand over the surface thoughtfully . " Not bad , not bad at all . Jacques is turning into a fine workman . " " Jacques ? " " Jacques Croll , one of our young workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anything you want changed . I 'll send him in in a moment , and meanwhile use the desk there . There is paper and anything else you may need . " It was not at all the daughter of the patronne , but the hindside of a little girl , with her head entirely hidden in the chest , whom Jacques found when he sauntered in . " Hi there , " he said as she backed out . " Like it ? You look like a donkey in his stall . " " It 's perfect , " she said in a husky voice . She looked as if she were on the point of tears . " Well , if it 's perfect , you do n't need to look so sad about it , Franci . I made it for you , " he added with a dazzling smile . " Did you find the secret drawer ? " He sat down cross-legged on the floor beside her . " What are you going to paint on the doors ? " " Maybe an elephant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle Books , with maybe the white seal inside and the jungle stories outside , " she said solemnly . She was too happy to smile . This was life , her life . And Jacques was part of it . They were making something together . It would always be like this . Now they were talking about something , now there was a subject between them , she felt safe . " What are the Jungle Books ? " he asked . " You do n't know the Jungle Books ? Oh , Jacques . " And then it was all pouring out . She could talk , and , having found her voice , at last able to talk to Jacques , she could n't stop . She told him the whole story of Mowgli as they sat on the floor , looking into the chest . And while she talked , he watched her . He remembered the jade rabbit . He remembered her as a little girl for whom he used to fly kites . He was sorry for everything . He would have liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratch her under the chin , make her laugh . " You 're looking very grown-up today , " he said when the story was finished . " You were n't listening . " Perhaps she had bored him . Perhaps she had talked too much . She fell desperately silent . " Oh yes , I was , but I was looking at you . I was thinking what a beauty the little girl I used to fly kites with has grown into . I was remembering my sins , " he said lightly . She looked straight ahead , waiting , waiting for something to happen , she did n't know what . He felt the lightness was wrong . You could n't talk to Francoise the way you could talk to other girls . Queer little creature . So still and so wild . He saw the pulse in her throat beating , beating . It pierced him all through , as if he were holding a bird in his hand , too much life in too small a space . He would have liked to take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she were a little girl again . Someone , he thought savagely , will break her heart . His hand closed over hers , tight , as if he would crush it . " Franci , " he whispered , " darling . "  | This was what she had been waiting for , this  --  a great blaze of fireworks inside her , spreading all through her as if the crimson tree of her blood were on fire . But what Jacques saw was a young girl , too young , a wild creature caught in his hand , staring straight ahead , severe , frozen . He had done the wrong thing . He stood up and lit a cigarette . " I must be getting back to work . " He inhaled deeply , and she watched the smoke come out of his mouth , not smoke any more , just a breath . It seemed like magic ; everything he did was magic now . " And you , my girl , must be getting to work too . " He gave her a last blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might tell Lou-Lou that I 'll be round tomorrow night , " he added , unconscious of the havoc he left behind him ; a lifetime compressed into a stroke of lightning when in a few seconds all was illuminated and then all blasted . In the darkness the child towered into a woman . It is not , after all , the fearfulness of what each person has to meet alone and in himself ; it is this set in counterpoint against daily living . It seemed for a while simply impossible for Francoise to go back and face having lunch with the family . What right had families to know what was going on inside their children ? It seemed to Francoise indecent . How could you live so close to people unless you could feel quite solitary and free , be allowed one place , your own soul , to withdraw into ? Would her father never understand that ? She could n't pretend that nothing had happened . It must show . It must be blazing on her face . But she could hold up a shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Mamie leaned out of the studio window and called down to her in the street . " The soup will be cold . " Hot soup on a day like this ! It seemed the last straw . " Well , were you pleased , my treasure ? Is it what you wanted ? " she said , holding her at arm 's length and looking at her proudly , and Francoise answered from her dream , from her mask : " Yes , Mamie. "  | " Papa has cadged a bottle of beer to celebrate your first job . " Francoise could escape to wash her hands and come back only when they had started eating and she could seem to be absorbed in drinking her soup . Paul was in one of his gay moods , teasing the two demoiselles . " Beware of this drink , " he said , handing Mlle. Zumpt a tiny glass of beer , " it is very strong . You will find yourself writing thousands of francs instead of hundreds on the account books . " And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with whole hearts . " Francoise is silent . Francoise does n't smile . Francoise can not believe she has such a foolish papa . Francoise is thinking about the beautiful design she will make for the chest . " Her name was like an invocation as he spoke it and as they drank to her . Only Mlle. Louvois , with her clear blue eyes , looked at Francoise and turned the conversation away . The child was suffering , that was clear enough . But the strange thing about families is that they are so concealed behind prefabricated ideas about each other that the obvious escapes them . Francoise was often moody , silent for no reason , and it was Melanie 's habit to ignore the moods . They always passed . " Oh , I am hungry ! " she ejaculated now , putting as much energy and zest into eating as she did into everything else . " Have another roll , Mlle. Louvois ; you 're eating nothing . " " Maurice was here this morning , " Paul said , " as full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater was doing marvelously  --  they have cut the debt down to a hundred thousand francs , a mere bagatelle , " he said solemnly , for it was well known that Maurice had absolutely no idea of the value of money . " He is putting on Dr. Knocke , and I could see that all the time he was talking he was wondering what pieces of furniture he could make off with for the set . I felt impelled to get up from that chair you are sitting in , Mlle. Zumpt , so he could really look it over . " They all laughed at Maurice , but it was impossible not to love him . He might have been covered with spangles . He always came into a room as the clown enters the arena in Paris , the serious clown , the sad clown all in spangles , with a white face , who stretches out his arms as the trumpets blow and waits for the applause , a glittering and tragic figure . They stopped laughing to listen to steps running up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he was . " Hello , old man ; forgive me , Melanie  --  mesdemoiselles "  --  he greeted them all effusively and hurriedly  --  " forgive my interrupting . I just wondered if I could possibly borrow that chair  --  it is just what we need  --  " He was interrupted by a gale of laughter and stood there , delighted to have been amusing without knowing it , his head cocked on one side . His face was so mobile that no one remembered exactly what he looked like  --  one remembered a vermilion tie , very black hair , little crinkly eyes , and the famous devilish eyebrows with pointed tufts that gave him the look of a faun . " Here you are , you devil . You have no conscience . What do you think Mademoiselle will sit on now ? Stripping us of our last stick of furniture for a paltry play , turning people out of house and home ! " " You shall all have tickets , a box , anything you like . " He had now grasped the chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know the play ? A little marvel of wit  --  and a perfect part for me . I 'm in heaven ! " " Well , as long as you 're in heaven , all 's right with the world , " Paul bantered . There was always an edge in his banter with Maurice . " Cabotin , " he added under his breath as Maurice crashed down the stairs . " He ! " Paul called down , " you can have the chair but not the whole building with it . " But all the answer they got was a whistle and then the loud purr of Maurice 's racing car . " What a madman , " sighed Mlle. Louvois.  | " Well , he enjoys himself , " Paul answered cynically . Francoise looked at her father with a flash of hatred . She adored Maurice . If she could have chosen to be like someone , it would be to be like him . " He has so much fantasy , " Melanie broke in enthusiastically , " and look what he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his standing desk with his coffee and looked at the drawing on it critically . " Yes , yes , " he sighed , " he has a sort of genius . He plucks a nettle and wears it like a laurel wreath . " ( Maurice had been a failure in Paris and then came back to Brussels and succeeded in creating his own theater . ) Melanie looked at her husband critically . There was always the stain of acid in his appreciation of anyone 's success . " Monsieur is a cynic , " said Mlle. Zumpt , with her genius for the obvious . " Well , well , " Paul mocked her , " you have been with us for twenty years , mademoiselle , and it dawns upon you that I am a cynic . Bravo ! What discrimination , what perspicacity ! " There it was again , the edge , the cutting edge in his voice . " You are impossible , Paul , " said Melanie , laughing at him . They did not take him seriously . They did not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only , thought Mlle. Louvois , he has a different way of showing off , that 's all . Only Francoise took him seriously , and as he met her level judginggaze he felt uncomfortable . He went over and put an arm around her , feeling her whole body go tense against him . " My little girl does not approve . My little girl thinks her papa is a disgrace . " " Yes , I do , " said Francoise coldly . Melanie looked at her in amazement . " What is the matter with you , Franci ? Why are you so glum ? Papa is not serious . " But mercifully the bell rang downstairs , and with cries of " A customer , en avant , children ! " she and Mlle. Zumpt went downstairs , leaving Francoise to clear away.  | This was what she had dreaded , to be left alone with her father . She knew , she waited for the change in his voice , the tearing tenderness , the ache of love that would attack her . " My treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , watching her pile up the dishes . With an immense effort she looked up and smiled . " Nothing , Papa , " she said , and made her escape . Paul was in the mood to talk . He wandered up and down , erased the penciled letters under the India ink , looked at his drawing , hummed a little tune , went to the window restlessly and looked at the row of pigeons making their everlasting murmur , bobbing their necks in and out at each other , swelling their breasts . The fact is , he thought , I am envious of Maurice . How wonderful it would he to be an actor , to give full rein to one 's personality , to be involved in an art and not a science , to be able to use oneself instead of painfully eliminating oneself . " Yes , yes , " he sighed , and then called down to Mlle. Louvois . In the last weeks he had come to depend on her . His temptation had never been physical infidelity , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked place of intimacy , of understanding with any woman . He did it with the purest intentions . It was always to help , and he had helped many women with his power to analyze and synthesize experience . It was not a temptation to sin , but to use the real power he had been given , the power of understanding . It had never occurred to him that it was forcing a way into the most closely guarded places in each human being , and that must be dangerous , involving serious responsibility . He had the daring of the amateur where a professional psychiatrist might have hesitated . And quite unconsciously he took it for granted that his " patients " would finally focus their emotions on him . Mlle. Louvois already felt that some invisible screen which.stood between people was removed where she and Paul were concerned . She could talk to him as she had never been able to talk ; she discoveredthings in herself that she had not known were there . Shep135was learning a great deal about marriage that she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melanie that she knew so much . It seemed not exactly disloyal , but as if she were looking through a keyhole . Once , as Paul was talking on about his wife , she had interrupted him . " Do n't say it . " " Why not ? " He had been startled . He did n't know what she meant , did n't seem to feel that he was a man and she a woman , that there are things about women that it is better not to say about one to another . But today he was anxious to find out what was the matter with Francoise . " Your daughter is in love . " " Nonsense . " Paul was walking up and down as he did so often , his hands in the pockets of his corduroy jacket , pacing up and down as if he could never rest , never sit quiet , never live as other people did , without straining every minute after some invisible quarry . " Nonsense , " he said again . " She 's a mere child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has violent crushes like any girl of her age  --  on Jacques , for instance . My dear Louise , you are incurably romantic , " he ended impatiently . She lit a cigarette and puffed a few times thoughtfully . She was sitting in a leather chair and it felt cool against her back . " I should n't be up here at all , you know . I should be downstairs finding something to do . " But she did n't move . " There 's nothing to do on a day like this . Too hot . Who would even buy an ash tray when the sidewalks are like ovens ? Stay here and talk to me . I 'm bored . I 'm restless . Will there be a storm ? " He went over to the window and looked out critically , as if he were judging the sky and found it wanting . It was perfectly blue and hard , like the roof of a huge tent , shutting the heat in . He smiled as he thought of Emile . " Emile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not really ? " " Yes , really . That 's what it is to be a natural man . Now you ,  |p136for  instance , might be terrified , but you would never have the audacity to get under the bed , to admit to yourself how frightened you were . " But before she could answer he turned his back on her and asked crossly , " What makes you so sure Francoise is in love ? " " Oh , the way she looked when she came in  --  I do n't know . " What was it really ? She could n't tell exactly why . " She looked dazzled and hurt and terrified that anyone would notice her . She made an effort not to show anything . You ca n't explain these things , but I knew right away . Is it Jacques ? " Now suddenly Paul seemed to come to life , to focus on the situation . " You do n't mean it seriously , Louise ? " The intensity of his voice made her hesitate . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader . " She shrugged her shoulders . " That was my impression . I may be wrong . " " But Jacques is nothing , a lame duck we 've helped along . A nice boy , to be sure " Paul was upset . This was the last straw in the middle of all the heat , at the end of the summer , to have Francoise get into trouble . She was too young , much too young . " You mean he 's not suitable ? " she teased . It was amusing . to see Paul so upset . " Suitable ! Well , of course it 's nothing but a childish infatuation . Suitable ! Why , she 's much too good for him . " " Well , do n't get upset . She has to grow up sometime . She has to fall in love . It wo n't last . " " You do n't know Frangoise . You do n't know what a whole person she is , how serious . Why , a thing like this could blast her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately . " It 's all wrong . " And then , " I do n't believe it anyway . I 'll go and speak to Jacques . I 'll tell him to mind his own business . " He really looked as if he were going to run out of the building without another word . " Are you crazy , Paul ? " She was sorry now that she had told him.  |p137But  how could she know he would take it like this ? " For heaven 's sake , do n't do anything at all . You 're the one who will blast her life if you rush in like that . Give it time , " she implored him , " and besides , I may be wrong . I am incurably romantic . You said so yourself . " " I must speak to Melanie . I must talk to my wife . " He was all impatience , all fire . " She 's having a business conference with Mlle. Zumpt . It looks as if that new order would go through , half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her . " " Oh , Paul , you know I could n't interrupt her . She 'd be furious . " Yes , that was true . Melanie concentrated on whatever she was doing completely . And in the daytime the business was sacred . " For a philosopher you certainly behave badly , " she added . " This is n't philosophy . This is life . This is my daughter . Ca n't you understand ? " " You ca n't stop her heart from beating . " " My dear Louise , she 's fifteen . " " Yes , that 's what I say . It is n't important . It wo n't last . Why get so upset about the inevitable ? You would n't have her unfeeling , insensitive , would you ? " she asked pointedly . He had talked enough about the price one pays for awareness . Was he unwilling to have it paid when it came close to him ? Suddenly he sat down as if he were tired of his own violence , as if he dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had long conversations with all these weeks . " I was taken by surprise , " he said quietly . " I had no idea  --  " For once he was n't able to articulate it in those beautiful flowing sentences as if he were dictating a book . ( Often she had wished she could write down what he said exactly as he said it . But now he was a human being , troubled , vulnerable , she loved him as she had not done before . ) Now above all he wanted his wife . He wanted to talk to Melanie . He felt tired and old . What did Louise know about having chil/dren ? About how one felt about one 's own child ? Now it was unbearable that she should suffer  --  and shut one out of her suffering . For now he was remembering F'rancoise 's face , the fold of her lips , the brilliance of her eyes . Why had n't he guessed ? Why had he let her go ? Louise smoked silently . With all her heart she wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business , and she was no one 's wife . When he got up and went to his desk and set himself silently to work , she slipped out . He did n't even know that she had gone . The boys were to leavethe next day . Already they were turning the house upside down looking for a misplaced pencil or a pair of rubbers , followed everywhereby the little ones , who were near to tears and got continually in the way . Everyone was jumpy and on edge . And everything here in the house smelled of parting . " Shall we have a last game of Le Nain Jaune ? " " Shall we climb the cherry tree for the last time ? " So Bo-Bo finally gave her consent : yes , they could take a picnic lunch and go to the forest . That would get them out of the way and into new surroundings . At once they became wildly gay . Francoise , working in the veranda , angry with the world , heard them stampede past , up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rucksacks ) like wild Indians . It seemed impossible for any one of them to speak in a normal tone of voice . All was screams and shouts and loud hilarity . And Bo-Bo thought she would never get them out of the kitchen without damage . They had to stuff the hard-boiled eggs , wrap up salt in a little piece of paper , make endless lettuce sandwiches , apple-butter sandwiches , put milk in a thermos , pack the rucksacks  --  and Pierre insisted onp139taking several books in case they should want to read . Then when the two boys had selected walking sticks from the stand in the hall and stood ready like mountain climbers , full of responsibility  --  then the sun went under a cloud . Would it rain ? Must the little ones take raincoats ? Bo-Bo finally compromised on sweaters tied around their middles . They were off . " Do n't go too far , " Bo-Bo called after them . " Take care that Solange does n't get tired . Do n't sit on the damp ground without something under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone . Now they were really off and on their own , the four children , who had been so hilarious a moment before , fell silent . They had to walk down the whole avenue to the main road before they crossed over and the adventure really began . The forest stood before them , very still and huge . Once across the car lines , they were in an entirely strange new world . There were no paths in the forest , or so it seemed , because the brush was all cut out and the tall , straight beech trees rose up on every side , making thousands of alleyways , shedding bronze leaves in the autumn so the whole floor of the forest was a golden carpet . High , high overhead , if you looked up , you could see tiny pieces of blue sky , clouds ; the surf of the wind in the tops of the trees never stopped . It was like being underwater , far down below on the earth . " I 'm scared , " Solange said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was like Little Red Riding Hood 's forest : there might be wolves . " What are you scared of ? " Hans teased . " Wolves , " she answered truthfully . " Wolves , eh ? Well , if we see a wolf I 'll kill him with my knife and give you the skin for a rug . " Hans was in his element . He whistled happily and loudly , as if he did n't hear the hush all around them , the silence of the forest which made whistling seem an impertinence.  | " Shh , Hans . " Pierre was bringing up the rear and already would have liked to sit down . Hans turned . " Why ? " " Because we ca n't hear anything , " Colette answered for him . Hans and Pierre had been on the verge of fighting for days , and she did n't want that  --  not on the last day . " Like what ? " Their feet sounded very loud on the leaves , now he had stopped . Solange tried walking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to help . " Like a bird , " Colette answered dreamily . They went on in silence . It was very cool now they had left the road , cool like a cave . But there were no birds singing . It was all still , silence suspendedaround them , and they the only interruption . " Let 's sit down and listen , " Pierre volunteered . But Hans insisted on going on . They were making for one of the small ponds deep in the forest , a pond where one might find frogs ' eggs in the spring . They had often been there with Mamie on a Sunday armed with nets and bottles . Hans was whistling again . " Stop it , Hans , " Colette said impatiently . " I 'll whistle if I want to , " he said crossly , and began again . He was whistling " Deutschland Ober Alles , " but luckily none of them recognized it . " Oh , the beautiful moss ! " Colette cried and ran to the foot of a tree . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firm . She pressed her hands on them with delight . Solange lay down to feel one against her cheek . " Ca n't I take some home ? " she begged . " Just wait a minute , Hans . " It was what the fairies liked better than anything , but she was afraid Hans would think that was childish . " All right , " he said importantly , looking at his watch . Pierre sat down and looked up at the trees , at their long green trunks . Now they were deep in the forest , and the gray trunks hadpI41turned green , a fine film of moss covering them . High , high up overhead the leaves were beginning to turn . Here and there a gold branch waved among all the green . How could he leave all this ? Go home to study in the family living room under the evening lamp , his mother sewing beside him , his father making drawings of specimens , pressing flowers , looking at him with gentle deep eyes , asking , without ever asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . It 's not my life , he was thinking . It 's not what I want . He felt too big for his parents , too powerful , as if he would knock into the furniture in the little house , as if he were a prisoner of their gentleness . There was the gold branch among all the green leaves , the summer gone already . He felt very sentimental and full of pity for himself . Someone was throwing leaves at his face . They got in his eyes and down under his shirt collar . " Stop it , " he said angrily . " What is this ? Leave me alone . " That Hans , what a nuisance he was , always trying to run everybody . " That 's not funny , " he said as he pulled himself up . The little ones were laughing at him . They were stuffing leaves into the rucksack . " Stop it ! " he said , in a passion of anger suddenly . " Hurry up , we 're only halfway there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so he could be by himself . Since they all thought him so funny , they could go on ahead . Solange was out of breath . No one paid any attention to her . Hans and Colette just kept on silently , side by side , as if no one else in the world existed . They had started out cheerfully , but now something in the stillnessmade them feel sad and lonely and a little cold . " Are you sure we 're on the right path ? " Pierre shouted from far behind . " Of course , " Colette and Hans called back . They had left parting behind them when they set out ; now here it was again , all around them in the forest , in the stillness.  | " Wait for me , " Solange cried , suddenly panic-stricken . She had seen something moving in a bush , or so she thought . It seemed as if they had been walking for hours , for days , as if they could never go back all that way , but finally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a brook , to the little stone bridge , and knew that the pond was just a few yards away . Pierre caught up , and everyone felt cheerful again , at the prospect of eating . They spread the sweaters and rucksacks out on the ground to sit on , and Hans made a pile of dry leaves for Colette . They were ravenous . They were excited to be so far from anywhere , all by themselves . They laughed very loudly and then , in spite of themselves , half listened for an echo . They wanted to be as close together as possible . " You 've already had one egg and a half , Pierre . That 's no fair . " Pierre , as usual , was absent-mindedly eating everything in sight . " I 'm sorry . Here "  --  he offered Colette a half-eaten egg  --  " you canhave the rest . " Hans was already up and looking for stones to skip across the pond . His idea of an excursion was to do something every minute . Pierre , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to lie on his back and dream . " Hans , " he called with his mouth full , " come back and sit down . We want to talk . " " Oh , all right . " He came back and lay down gracefully on his side . He looked very handsome and self-assured , as if he were on the best of terms with his own body , and Solange and Colette watched him attentively while they ate their sandwiches . " What shall we talk about ? " " About what we 'll do next summer , " Solange suggested . Of course they would all be together again . Hans and Pierre had both been formally invited . It seemed like a safe enough subject , and they embarked on it eagerly . For lately they had come to realize that there were unsafe subjects , subjects they had better keep away from , subjects thatp143made Hans and Pierre go for each other like two dogs with their hackles raised . " Next summer , " Hans was saying thoughtfully , " we might build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish . " Pierre did n't like climbing trees . He was afraid of falling . " It 's only because you 're scared that you say that . " " We 'll have a fire at the end of the garden and cook potatoes , " Colette interrupted quickly . But Pierre was determined to be irritating . " Well , maybe I am scared . I do n't think physical strength is important one way or another . You despise anyone who 's weak or scared , but it 's the weak often who accomplish the great things in the world . " " You 're not weak , you 're just soft , " Hans said , digging a hole viciously with a stick . Solange moved over to where she could hold Colette 's hand . It was not nice suddenly . It was not a conversation at all . It was this thing that happened now whenever they were together , like a shadow over the sun when nothing came right . Hans and Pierre felt it too . They did n't either of them want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the orbit of hatred as if it were a magnet . Ever since Lou-Lou had called him a German in that contemptuous voice something had been happening inside Hans . He watched everyone for signs of their real feelings ; the only two people he really trusted were Tante Melanie and Colette . And because he was ready to be slapped with a word , he was always looking for a chance to slap someone else first . Especially Pierre . Pierre was easy to tease because he was clumsy and fiery all at once and because he too was an outsider . Hans sensed the shade of condescension in the Duchesnes ' attitude toward Pierre . " All right , I 'm soft . " Pierre sat up and glared at Hans . " Do n't , Pierre , " Colette begged . " It 's our last day . " But they were spoiling for a fight . As well try to stop a thunder/storm . Pierre went on , " But at least I 'm not taken in by hysterics like your dear Adolf . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The forest seemed to whirl round Hans 's head . He was black with rage . He wanted to kill him . He sprang to his feet and stood looking down at Pierre , who was frightened now and showed it . " All right , let 's fight it out . " Colette stood up too and grasped one of Hans 's hands . " Oh no , Hans . " She turned imploringly to Pierre . " No , Pierre , please do n't . " She was near to tears . " You stay out of this . " Hans pushed her away savagely . " Will you fight or wo n't you ? You coward ! " Pierre had gone quite white and looked shockingly scared . He stammered slightly , " If we f-fight you 'll win , but that wo n't mean I 'm wrong and you 're right . It 'll only m-mean that you 're stronger . " While he spoke he got up . " I thought you Belgians were supposed to be brave , but I guess you 're only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't stand alone . " Hans was watching him narrowly . This was his chance to get back at them all . He 'd show them who was strongest , who was brave . He 'd lick the pants off that fat boy . " Stop it , Hans ! " Colette screamed . " Stop it ! You 're crazy ! " But she did n't go near him . He had drawn a circle of anger around himself like a wall . Only Solange rushed at him in a passion and beat him with her fists . " I hate you ! I hate you ! " she cried , tears streaming down her face , choking with rage . He could n't hit her . He flung her off roughly and went up and punched Pierre on the nose . He was taken completely by surprise . He could n't see for a moment , but when he did he lunged at Hans and closed in . Pierre had never been taught to box and he was soft , but he was heavier than Hans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to and because he was mad . He kicked and bit and wrestled like a savage . There was no sportsmanship in it . Once hep145had Hans down , but the lithe boy wriggled out and twisted Pierre 's arm . To Colette , to Solange , it looked as if they would kill each other . Pierre 's mouth was all bloody . He looked terrifying . Hans was still cool and angry like steel . There was never any doubt who would win in the long run . " Pierre , oh , Pierre , " Colette whispered as if it were a prayer . Hans hit him hard in the eye with a fist , and Pierre began to bawl loudly , hitting out with both arms blindly , but on the defensive now . " Hit him back , Pierre . Hit him ! " Solange screamed . But Hans got in another punch on the mouth . Pierre was reeling . " Have you had enough ? " Hans asked grimly . Pierre sat down , weeping unashamedly . " Yes , " he sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree and was sick . Hans went off to wash his face in the pond . His shirt was torn and he had a big scratch across his chest . Solange sat down beside Pierre , crying as if her heart would break . His head was hidden in his arms . She did n't dare touch him . " Help me pack the rucksacks , Solange , " said Colette when she came back . She said it stiffly , as if she were coming back from a long way off . They would never say anything about it , but they were both terribly ashamed of Pierre . Solange 's tears were tears of shame . It was Hans who brought back a wet handkerchief to wipe Pierre 's face . " Here , " he said shyly , " use this . " He had won , and he had had to fight and win , but there was no triumph in it . He felt achingly sad and lonely now . Colette and Solange ignored him as if he had ceased to exist . They walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out of the forest , which had become a nightmare , a hostile place , a place to be forgotten as quickly as possible and never gone back to again . It was the place  --  though none knew it  --  where each had become involved against his will in conflicts far larger than himself ,  |p146had  been forced out of love into old hate , had been seized with passions hardly his own , had been violently used . It was true that each knew himself betrayed : each sick and exhaustedand dazed , like soldiers after a battle . From far off they could see the sunlight at the edge of the forest , the safe normal trolley car rattling past , the familiar horn , and they ran to reach it as if the whole forest were marshaled against them and they were making their escape . Once in their own avenue again , they slowed down . Colette and Solange walked hand in hand ; Hans , a little ahead , alone ; Pierre , as usual , in the rear . Now , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened was their own business . They must keep it from the family . They agreed to say that Pierre had fallen and hit his mouth on a stone . Hans would sneak in the back way and change his shirt . No one must ever know . They themselves would forget it , pretend , if they could , that it had never happened . It was extraordinaryhow empty the house felt now the two boys had gone . Like lovers who have not had a chance to be alone , the family were shy , especially at mealtimes , to find themselves face to face , with no strangers . The little ones were embarrassed when their mother talked on about Hans ; and Francoise , everyone knew , was suffering , so they must all try to be gay and matter-of-fact as if they could n't tell she 'd been crying again . The magic circle was failing them : there were gaps . There were windy places , frightening dark places , even here back in the little breakfast room under the eveninglamp . Like a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air.  |p147Only  Bo-Bo seemed more than ever the same , unchanged , a rock . She said , " Lou-Lou is out of her wits . She forgot to put the laundryto soak last night " ; she said , " We must have the chair covers in the salon cleaned before they are put away , madame " ; she said , " The hens are laying again , thank heavens . " Everyone made appropriateresponses , thankful for Bo-Bo , with whom each had his own unchangeable relationship , Bo-Bo who saw and knew everything and could be counted on to behave as if she saw and knew nothing . It was a relief when the chairs grated back and the family could stop pretending it was a unit and disperse . For once Melanie and Paul sat at the uncleared table long after everyone had gone . " Hello , my dear , " he said after looking at her a moment , as she sat leaning on one elbow , her cheek on her hand , meditative , astonishinglyyoung . Silently they tasted each other 's smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly needing to express what each knew the other was thinking . But when the smile had gone , sadness passed over Melanie 's face like a visible shadow . She got up and began to clear away , saying as she did so : " Jacques is coming tonight . I 'll speak to him while Lou-Lou is changing her dress . " " What are you going to say to him ? " " I do n't know . " Paul was playing the piano on the table , his long nervous hands tapping out the rhythm in his mind . " Yes , yes , " he said to himself . It meant , Yes , yes , we are getting old . It meant , Yes , yes , we are helpless to help our children even though we may try . And then he got up , for he did n't want to see Jacques at all . He went over and stopped Melanie with her hands full of dishes , lifted her chin , and looked at her half humorously , tenderly . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and went upstairs . They had talked so much about the whole matter that these halfp148sentences were all they needed now to communicate . At first Melanie had refused to believe that Francoise was in love with Jacques . Like Paul , she was too surprised , too unused to the idea that the child was growing up . It seemed fantastic . Besides , Jacques ( they all knew it and teased him about it ) was obviously courting Lou-Lou . She shied off from admitting that it could be serious  --  and if it were , Francoise was really a child . She would get over it She would have to . Paul and Melanie had decided not to push her , not to try to penetrate her silences , to leave her alone . This they had done for almost a week , but it was hard , almost impossible , to live in the same house with this silent suffering and not put out a hand . For Melanie it had been a fearful week . Her flesh ached to hold Franci in her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her that she would come through , that they all loved her , that she was their dear , their eldest . It was against her whole nature to sit passivelyand be a witness to suffering . Eventually they would have to talk . They would have to break down the dam . We ca n't , she thought , go on living like this , strangers to each other , under the same roof . But for once Paul , sensitized , fully awake to his daughter 's nature , had been adamant . She must be absolutely free of pressure , free to suffer if she must , free to be herself . But oh , it was hard  --  it was hard to do . A half hour later Paul looked down from his study window into the dusk and saw Melanie and the tall , handsome boy walking up and down , up and down the paths , arm in arm , her emphatic right hand punctuating her speech . She is stronger , more selfless than I am , he thought . She moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife , he thought , and suddenly , as if his heart had opened to an irresistible flood , he turned and went up the stairs to Franci 's room . It was not a conscious transition , a conscious avowal , only in his heart he recognized that Francoise and he were somehow of the same kind and Melanie another kind . And seeing this , he knew he could help her . But when he reached her closedp149door he stood outside , hesitating , stood a long time , not daring to knock . Down in the garden Melanie was talking about Lou-Lou . " She loves you . She wants to marry . Do n't you think , Jacques , that it is time you made up your mind ? " she said abruptly , breakingthe easy rhythm of their walk . His hand pulled out from her arm . He stood in the path , facing her but looking down so she could n't read his eyes . How handsome he is , she thought . After a moment he shrugged his shoulders and smiled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , I do n't want to marry . " What did it remind her of ? That tone of voice ? That look ? Years and years ago , sitting on the steps at his father 's , the first day she found him , when he said , " I do n't like work . " Yes , that was how he looked then . But it had not been true . " You do n't want children ? A home ? " she asked gently . " You want to go on forever living in other people 's houses ? Playing with other people 's children ? I do n't understand you . " For a moment Jacques looked as if he would run away . Instead he drew her arm through his and they walked silently down the long path away from the house , into the dusk . She waited for him to answer , but he did n't answer . Only in the gentle way he held her arm , in the very slight pressure of his hand , she felt that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to tell her that he knew she was his friend . " You know how fond I am of you , Jacques . I 've watched you grow from an irresponsible boy into a man , from a boy who said he hated work into an expert craftsman  --  you remember how you felt about going to work ? And now look at you ! Perhaps this feelingabout marriage is just as false , just as much an idea of yoursShe waited , but still he did n't answer , only walked a little faster . " Are you in love with Lou-Lou ? " she asked directly.  |p150He  stopped to light a cigarette . They were standing near a bench under the cherry tree , and Melanie sat down and looked up at him earnestly . How impenetrable he seemed ! What was going on in his mind ? Not Francoise ? The thought crossed her mind with a fearfuldread . Not Francoise ! " I do n't know , " he said , sitting down beside her abruptly . " Am I in love ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without enthusiasm . " But marriage  --  forever  --  well  --  " The arrogance of men , Melanie thought , suddenly angry . " Well , you had better make up your mind before you break someone 's heart , " she said coldly . It was nearly dark now . In the distance she could see Paul 's lighted window , the only light on in this side of the house . From somewhere the summer wind brought the scent of stock , drenching the night air . An owl cried far off . " That 's an owl . " Jacques sat up , delighted at any interruption . " Pay attention to what I 'm saying , Jacques . This is serious . " But instead of saying anything , she fell silent . They sat in the dark , and Jacques wondered why smoking in the dark was no pleasure . He was waiting for something to happen . He thought of Lou-Lou somewhere far off in the house , the woman waiting for him , the woman he wanted . He threw away his cigarette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ? " he asked suddenly . Then they both laughed . It sounded absurd . And yet that was what stuck in his mind . He could imagine going to bed with LouLouwell enough , too well . He could imagine her cooking the supperand washing the dishes , bearing his children , standing so handsome at the ironing board . But he could not imagine what he would find to say to her all his life , or she to him . The idea terrifiedhim . And in his laughter Melanie heard the terror , the gasp of being caught . " My dear , " she said , taking his hand in hers in a firm clasp . - " Lou-Lou will never mind if you do n't talk at all . She 'll talk for both of you . That 's the least of your worries . "  |p151It  struck them both suddenly as howlingly funny . They laughed uproariously , until the tears were rolling down Melanie 's cheeks . They did n't know why they were laughing except the relief of havinggot down to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give you one of the apartments in town for a year as a wedding present , " Melanie said when they were comfortably walking back again toward the house , at ease now , delighted with themselves . " That 'll give you a chance to get on your feet , to buy some furniture . " She could n't afford it , of course , but who can afford happiness ? She felt immensely happy . As they reached the front door and stood under the arbor in the dark she kissed him on both cheeks . She looked at him gravely a moment . " This is the right thing , Jacques . I hope you will be happy . " And then they went in together . It flashed through Melanie 's mind that it had been almost too easy . But surely it was the right thing for Jacques now to settle down ? And Lou-Lou loved him , really loved him . She would build the marriage on a firm foundation . She would know how to construct a life for them both with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family should be . Something in Jacques she would never touch , the wildness , the scream of emptiness  --  coulda person ever fill that ? Answer it ? Besides , Melanie was learning that it was not what was given but what one brought to a marriage that was important . The gifts were never equal , the gifts of self at least . There was no absolute communion . Only ore person was willing to go out much farther to meet the other , avid once this place of meeting was established , they could build . For the time being , at least , Lou-Lou and Jacques would have no difficulty in finding a meeting place . Passion would take them there . And for the rest , who could ever tell ? When Paul finally knocked on Francoise 's door she was lying on her bed in the dark . She thought it was Colette , who often came in to kiss her good night . When she saw her father standing there she was too startled for a moment to pull on her dressing gown . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in and sit down for a moment ? " " Of course . " Paul came into the room and looked around . He was amused to see how impersonal an atmosphere Francoise made around herself even here in her own room . There were two rows of books  --  schoolbooksand a few books of her own , Katherine Mansfield , Tolstoy , Romain Rolland , three or four of the early Colette 's  --  a desk which she never used except for lessons , as her drawing board was downstairs ; over the desk a newspaper photo of Lindbergh , an enlarged snapshot of Swiss mountains , and in a small leather case two very old battered photographs of Melanie and Paul , one a passport picture . " Where on earth did you dig up that awful picture of me darling ? " he said , sitting down at the desk in the window . It had been taken shortly after the war , and he looked like a frightened convict . " I found it years ago when Mamie was clearing out her desk . " Francoise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , in her slip , intensely still . All her quills are standing straight out and ready to prick like a little porcupine , Paul thought to himself . It was quite impossible to make small talk with Francoise . She forced people , by her intensityand complete lack of social grace , to meet her directly or not at all . She could not play any game with anyone , not even with her father . And she resented this quality in herself more than any other . What a lot of anguish she would save herself if she could smile now and tease him about his convict 's face . But she could n't . She could only murmur something about liking the photo ; she could only wait like St. Sebastian , tied to a tree , for the arrows to pierce , the arrows of tenderness , of love , the arrows that went to the heart . Paul refrained from looking at her . He picked a Colette out of the bookcase and leafed it over.  | " You would like to get away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel her mind as if he were a doctor feeling out fracture in a bone . He put his hand unerringly on the truth . That was what seemed so terrible . For all her life Francoise had instinctively hiddenthe fracture , hidden the wound . Comfort , understanding , which to most children would be a blessing , was to her an agony . Once things were known , explored by someone else , her own secret things , she could no longer deal with them . Her roots were nourishedon silence . So now she winced . " Why should I ? " " Darling , you are not happy . It does n't take any very extraordinaryperception to see that . And when one is unhappy one imagines that one can leave unhappiness behind by moving to another place . I wish we could afford to send you to England to school , but we ca n't . " His tone of voice was practical ; she felt reassured for a moment and sat down on the pillow at the end of the bed . Paul lit a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on , as he always did , inexorablyexposing her to herself , " because something tremendous is happeninginside you and you feel that everything here threatens it . With us you are a child , our little girl . And now you are growing up , you feel stifled by the little girl , by all our ideas about you . You want to be yourself and you think that is impossible here . Is n't that it ? " he asked , turning and looking at her keenly for the first time . " I do n't know , " Francoise answered in a flat , dull voice . She was holding herself back with all the power and the passion with which she would one day give herself wholly . But not to him , not to him . That would be to lose everything , lose her own soul and get nothing in return . " Do you mind if I go on talking a little , talking to myself as well as you ? Perhaps we can help each other , " he said gently . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would go on anyway , whether she answered or not.  | She looked extraordinarily handsome , sitting very straight on the bed . She had always had dignity as a child . Now there was something more fiery and absolute that made Paul want to talk to her as a woman . " I 'm going to tell you a story about myself , " he said after a moment . " Long before I met your mother , when I was still at the Lycee , a cousin of my father 's came to stay with us for a month . She was ten years older than I. She played the piano professionally , and all that month I sat in the next room to her in the afternoons after school , when I was supposed to be studying , and listened . She played Bach magnificently . It seemed to me while I listened that my whole life was clear before me . I suddenly understood all sorts of things I had never even glimpsed before . I would come out of my study at dinnertime on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her . " I had never known any women . I had never been in love before , and now what I felt was so intense that I wondered how I could live from day to day . " It seemed as if Paul had forgotten his daughter as he talked . And Franrcoise breathed more freely , relaxed , wanted to hear the end of the story . She had always thought of her father and mother together . It was strange , a little disconcerting , deeply exciting to know there had been something else , long before she was born , another life  --  her father 's . " I spent all my pocket money on violets for her , and she was , I see now , charming to me . But at the time everything she did was cruel because of course she could n't love me  --  I was a mere child  --  and I did love her . " There Paul stopped , puffing his cigarette , as if he had finished . " What happened ? " " What happened ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and a few years later she married . I never saw her again . " Then Paul got up and came over and sat on the bed like a student , leaning over , his hands between his knees.  | " But you see , Franci , that is n't really what happened . That 's what I wanted to tell you . " Where was he leading her ? Into what trap ? Francoise was torn between wanting desperately to know and the terror of being caught suddenly . But she finally asked : " What happened , really ? " " I grew up . In that month I learned everything one can learn about love , love in the purest and most passionate sense , love in the abstract , detached from life , in its essence . And that was because she did n't love me . I never learned anything about her , but I learned a great deal about myself . So that when years later I met your mother , I was ready to live all this knowledge in reality and not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is infinitely harder to love someone and to be loved than to understand all about it in one 's mind . " " Yes , " she murmured , blushing fiercely , " I know . " " But one grows up in a day through the other things . In this last week you 've grown up . You might be able to hide that from us , but you ca n't hide it from yourself . It does n't matter who it is who has opened all the doors for you like a great gust of wind , but they are open . All that I want you to know , my darling , " he said , getting up and standing beside her while she bent her head in an agony of shame , " is that this that looks to you now like nothing but pain and nightmare is only the beginning of your real life and not the end  --  the beginning of love and not the end . " He went out quietly and closed the door behind him . The end ? The beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and difficult and everything had the power to hurt . Franci turned over on her stomach and wept . Maybe she would forget Jacques someday , but not now . And now was where she was , now . How could she live through tomorrowand the next day and the next , forever and ever ? Stay here in the family , have to endure her father 's eyes , her mother 's eyes , the eyes of everyone she loved and hated , day after day ?  | " I ca n't ! I ca n't ! " she sobbed , not caring now who heard , who came . Colette sat up in her bed on the floor below and listened . Papa had been up and then come down again , and now he and Mamie were talking in his study . What was happening to Francoise ? What had he done to her ? The dark seemed full of suffering and terror , the night full of weeping . But although she was frightened of the dark ( there had always been a polar bear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny child ) , she must get to Francoisebefore something awful happened . Somewhere between the child world and the grown-up world Colette moved , registering shock like a sensitive instrument for registering earthquake . So much one was never told  --  like the day before when she had found a pail of bloody cloths in the bathroom and run out screaming into the hall , thinking someone had been fearfully wounded . And then Bo-Bo had come and talked to her about how women bore their children and every month went through a period of bleeding and that this was nothing . It was all so frightening and full of mystery . She wanted to grow up , and know , and not be frightened any more . Tonight the house was full of grown-up suffering and mystery , where she did not belong . But she braved the polar bear , crept , trembling with fear , up the dark stairs and flung herself on Francoise , whispering desperately : " You must n't cry , Franci . You must n't . Everyone loves you . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then , as Francoise turned and buried her face in the pillow again : " Franci , everyone loves you . " " That 's just it , " the broken voice sobbed , " that 's just it . " But just because Colette could n't understand , she was able to comfort her sister . They went to sleep together , curled into each other 's arms.  |p157This  was Lou-Lou 's wedding day and it was raining , so all the plans for a collation in the garden had to be changed at the last minute . Already , early in the morning , before breakfast , the house was a hive of activity . For once Lou-Lou herself was not allowed to do anything at all : Colette took up her breakfast on a tray , a rose covered with raindrops , which she had run out at the last minute to pick , lying across the napkin . And Lou-Lou looked like a rose herself , a rose covered with raindrops , for she wept continually with happiness and when she saw Colette burst into loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's your wedding day , " Colette said shyly . She had very rarely been in Lou-Lou 's room and she was shocked to see a bleeding heart hanging over the bed , a rosary at the foot , and a pink-and-blue statue of the Virgin standing in a shell on the dresser . Lou-Lou explained in a stifled voice that she was going to miss them all . The fact was , she had not imagined leaving this house , the children , all the known familiar world ; she had not imagined that marriage would be a terrible parting as well as a meeting . And Colette was embarrassed , standing by the bed shyly telling Lou-Lou that of course they would come and see her often . " And now , " said Colette firmly , in a very good imitation of her mother , " you must eat your breakfast , Lou-Lou . " Then she ran down the three flights of stairs and arrived breathlessin the kitchen , where Solange and Bo-Bo were sitting , surrounded by all the silver , cleaning it fiercely . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done today . " She 's crying , Bo-Bo , " she said , as if she were a courier bringing a report from a battle . " People always cry on their wedding day , " sniffed Bo-Bo . There would be enough sentiment floating around without her adding to it today . " You grind the coffee , my treasure ; we have to have breakfast anyway . " Colette thoughtfully poured coffee into the cup of the grinder , held it between her knees , and struggled to turn the stiff handle . She strained and pushed till it seemed impossible to move the handle , but finally it made the right sound  --  a steady crackling of coffee beans  --  and slowly the little drawer at the bottom filled with fine coffee powder and its bitter strong smell , the morning incense . Colette decided , as she emptied the drawer , that she would never marry . How could she leave Mamie and the house ? What would they do without her ? Melanie , in her sabots , was out in the potager picking lettuces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettuces , and even the rain running down her face and neck was warm and gentle , like a promise . She was proud of Francoise , who had refused to go to a friend for the week end , insisting that she wanted to help . My brave girl , she thought , my fine brave girl . Ever since Melanie had told her that Jacques was getting married Francoise had somehow got hold of herself . All this week she had been working on the designs for the chest , talked gladly of their plans to send her next year to the Academy of Design , seemed in fact like a different person . She had got through this alone . Melaniewas proud , proud and  --  yes , admit it , she said to herself , pullinga snail off a lettuce leaf  --  a little sad . She had hoped for some confidences , for some communion with her child . But that had not happened . She was to be admired and loved from a distance , like a stranger . How , Melanie asked herself honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She stood up and looked round at this garden where she had spent so many years , at the earth she passionately loved ; with the rain leaking into her sabots and her wet dress clinging to her legs , she stood , a stout , indomitable woman , her hands full of mud and small green lettuces , and felt the life go out of her in a flood , leav/ing her empty . What is it all for ? What does it mean ? If she should die , the garden would turn into a wilderness in a couple of years . All that backbreaking work , all that love and care would go for nothing . What was left when one died ? What did a life mean ? What made one go on ? Melanie rarely indulged in such speculations . For one thing , there was no time . But when she did , like everything else she did , her whole being was involved . She was shaken to the roots . Where is Paul ? she thought wildly . But , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little while . She was not alone in a meaningless universe . She was responsible for all these lives . And Jacques , dear boy , was getting married today . Whatever the abyss , the emptiness within , life does n't stop ; life , which seems such a burden , is really the bearer , the support , the lifter of hearts . Melanie wiped her forehead with a muddy hand and called in through the kitchen window : " Allons , les enfants  --  it 's time to ring the bell for breakfast ! " Francoise , standing at her window , half listening for the breakfastbell , looking out at the purple and black leaves of the maple , listening to the steady drip of water from the eaves ( the gutters must be choked and the water spilling over ) , Francoise was hardly thinking . She had been in a state of intoxication for the last week , intoxication at being herself . When Mamie had told her the date for the wedding , she had wondered how she would bear it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . And then this extraordinary thing had happened . The pain stopped  --  stopped like a tooth that stops aching for no reason . Some blessing had come to her , all unasked , unexpected . She felt full of power , the power to do her work , power to live and to be herself . When she woke up now , the first thing she thought of was the design for the chest ; next week she would start painting it . She hardly thought of Jacques at all . That was finished . It had been a major operation . Now she was completely well , so well that she could even move among the family without getting all tied up in knots . It was sop160simple to love her mother , her father , and to know herself loved and appreciated . Why had she never been able to know this be-fore ? Everything gleamed and glistened around her . Even the rain this morning seemed to her beautiful and appropriate . I am myself , she thought , walking down the stairs like a princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had there been such a morning of cleaning and cooking and preparations of all sorts . Paul opened the door to his study and flooded the house with music , a whole hour of waltzes  --  so Melanie waltzed along the halls with the mop ; Solange and Colette finished all the silver and laid the big table in the dining room , counting and recounting the guests , and Bo-Bo was busy in the kitchen , calling out when there was a spoon to be licked or , best of all , the saucepan with chocolate sauce to be scraped . Lou-Lou refused to stay in her room , she was so nervous and frightened , so they let her do what she wanted  --  which , it appeared , was to slosh down the tiled floors downstairs one last time . So there the bride was , on her knees , squeezing out the old rag , workingaway in her first really happy moment of the day . Francoise had retired to the veranda to make place cards for everyone . And then , before they were half ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take place in the little church in Jacques 's village , Paul driving them all over in the car . " Hurry up , Mamie . We have to wash , " the little ones pleaded outside the bathroom door . They had put on their best white corduroydresses . What would Bo-Bo say if she knew they were going to wash their black hands and faces after they were dressed instead of before ? Melanie at the last moment could n't find a whole stocking and had to borrow one of Bo-Bo 's . Paul was sitting in the car blowing the horn at regular intervals and trying to . keep the rain out of his coat collar.  |p161Lou-Lou  had been ready for hours . Her shoes pinched her feet terribly . She was entirely occupied with trying to manage her long dress , her floppy hat , and her bunch of roses , which was just as well , as it gave her something to think about . They must find the umbrellas  --  tell Bo-Bo to keep the cat out of the dining room . Where is Francoise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car , Lou-Lou and Paul in front , the rest of the family squashed onto one another 's laps in the back . Bo-Bo waved from the front door . For an hour or two she would have the house to herself . The roast should have been in the oven a half hour ago ! Heavens , where are my wits ? I would n't be marryingthat rascal , she thought to herself , not for the world . Bo-Bo had seen a lot of marriages in her life , and she had come to the conclusion that they were hardly worth all the trouble they caused . It was her private opinion that any woman who saw what she was getting in for would run away at the church door . But then they never do know , she considered , and perhaps that is just as well for the future of the race ... . In the rain the village looked somber , all black and gray , black umbrellas , black Sunday suits , black dresses and shawls , and the dark gray of roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou-Lou , " Paul said as they pulled up in front of the church in a murmur of " There she is ! There 's the bride ! "  --  " well , " Paul went on , " it 's your last chance to change your mind . " The awful thing was that now she was in for it , Lou-Lou 's only emotion was terror . She had forgotten Jacques 's kisses , his blue eyes  --  she only knew that she was marrying a stranger , someone who might be cruel , violent , in some unknown way terrible . She clasped her rosary and prayer book and prayed , " Mary , help me . " And then she was being embraced and teased by her uncle from Brussels , the only member of the family who had been able to come and who would give her away . He was an enormous redfacedman with a stubble of gray hair ; he earned his living as a masseur and quack doctor in the popular quarter of Brussels.  | The whole village was pouring into the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many stopped to light a candle at the small shrine of St. Joseph ; in spite of the rain  --  a penetrating drizzlelike a cloud in the air  --  the outer porch and steps of the church were crowded , and Melanie was soon deep in conversation with La Grande Louise , while Paul went in with the children . Solange and Colette pinched each other 's arms convulsively as they recognized people . Solange would surely have the giggles before the service was over , and then what would she do ? Colette wondered . They had been brought up to hate everything about the Catholic Church , so now the smell of incense , the altar , the statues of the saints , and the large gory painting of the Crucifixion over the altar fascinated them as if they were in the presence of some pagan sacrifice . " Look at the Virgin , " Solange whispered loudly . " Shh , " Colette answered . Would they know when to kneel ? Francoise waited . All of this had nothing to do with her . She was outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone tapped her on the shoulder and she turned to face the two demoisellesfrom in town . They smiled and nodded and she smiled back . When would it begin ? She felt her father beside her , knew he was wondering how she would manage , shivered slightly at the idea that he might take her arm . Like Lou-Lou , she wondered desperately why she had ever come . But Paul was not thinking of her , as a matter of fact . Always and in spite of himself he was deeply moved in a church . Always he questioned himself when he was in the presence of faith . Was it arrogance , intellectual pride that kept him from taking this overwhelmingly simple answer to all his questions ? There was such a tiny line between himself , sitting there outside it all , and the woman just in front of them , on her knees , her face in her hands . At any moment , anywhere in the span of one 's life , it couldp163happen , the gesture could be made , the abnegation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What in all these images and symbols was the impossible ? The bleeding heart , the suffering man on the cross , the everlasting compassion of the woman in blue ? Was he so superior to these symbols that he could stare at them coldly , unmoved , and not recognize his deepest longings there ? Was it possibleat all to come to faith , to life through reason , holding the heart hack at the door of revelation while the mind climbed slowly and painfully to the same final place ? But if Paul prayed , it was a prayer to suffer and struggle to the end in the way he had chosen . It was not to yield . It was to keep the mind pure and stern , even in agony , even in love . Jacques and Lou-Lou were kneeling now at the altar , and all over the church the women wept in an ecstasy of remembrance , . of compassion for their own lost youth , for the solemnity of innocence , for the pure moment of happiness given to them once more  --  noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulgingover her tight shoes , noting how she trembled and how Jacques did not . At last it was over . Lou-Lou tripped on her dress as she walked down the aisle , triumphant , blushing , the traces of tears making her eyes smile brilliantly  --  and everyone loved her for tripping , for being clumsy and quite unconscious with relief and happiness . But Jacques was eagerly searching the crowd for someone  --  and when he found her he shamelessly winked at Francoise . Before she knew it she had winked back . It was so unexpected , so charming  --  it made a pact between her and Jacques . It said to her , " You know , this is all nonsense . " It was the only thing that could have touched her to the quick , made her blaze again with happiness , with the sense of infinite things to come , of the whole future opened out . It was like a miracle . And Melanie , who had lost her family in the crush at the door , .  |p164was  amazed to be met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones after her , giggling excitedly and calling : " We must hurry , you know , or they 'll get there before us ! " This time Paul would take the wedding party back in the car  --  Lou-Lou and Jacques , Croll and the uncle and the uncle 's highly rouged enormous wife . The children and Melanie would walk to the streetcar and go home that way with the two demoiselles . At home M. Plante and Simone and Francis were to make up the luncheon party . The rain had stopped ; a weak watery sun was trying to shine through the low gray sky . The little ones jabbered on . " Did n't Jacques look handsome ? .. . Did you see his white carnation ? . . . Why is there so much blood on the statues , Mamie ? " And Francoise smiled to herself , tasting and tasting again the look in Jacques 's eyes , the mischievous look , the companionable wonderful wink he had given her like a present on his wedding day . The luncheon went off splendidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children enjoyed themselves running back and forth to the kitchen as waiters ; Bo-Bo was made to come in for the champagne and the speeches , laughing in spite of herself at the uncle 's broad jokes at Lou-Lou 's expense . Simone and Melanie exchanged tender amused glances . Simone thought , " What a genius these people have for living , for making happiness around them . " It was all so simple and natural and human , Paul putting everyone at his ease , complimenting the women , going the uncle one better when it came to his turn to make a speech , enjoying to the full this preposterous combination of people , outrageous in his humor , delighted with himself . " The groom ! The groom ! " They shouted noisily as the champagnewas passed once more by Francoise . " A-hum . " Jacques cleared his throat theatrically and threw down his napkin . They waited expectantly . Just as he was going to speak , Lou-Lou 's aunt belched quite loudly , and this was greetedp165with roars of laughter and applause which only increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg your pardon , I 'm sure , " not certain whether she should be angry or not . Jacques waited for silence . " Give him a chance , now he is on his feet ! " roared the uncle . " Come on , young man ! " " I would like , " Jacques said quietly , and the murmur of laughter stopped as they felt the sincerity in his voice , " I would like to propose a toast to M. and Mme. Duchesne . I would like to speak of them first as our patrons  --  for my father , for myself , and for LouLou . I would like to go back ten years , when I first came here as a returned soldier , and try to tell you something of their kindness , their understanding . " Melanie looked down at Croll 's gnarled , short-fingered hands lying on the table  --  it was strange to see them without a tool , a watering pot , a young plant in them . He had sat beside her silently all through the luncheon , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as everyone else laughed aloud . And now he had laid his hands on the table , one on each side of his plate as if he had abandoned them . She looked up at his face and was moved to see tears in his eyes . Was he at last proud of his son ? Or was he remembering things long ago , going back to his own life ? She would never know . No one would ever know . But she was glad , after all these years of bending beside him over the garden , to sit beside him now and drink champagne . She had missed some of what Jacques was saying , as the table applauded loudly , smiling at Paul and Melanie . What was that ? " This house , these splendid children , " Jacques went on . The champagne had made him eloquent . " The life here . No one could tell what it has meant to me . " Lou-Lou was weeping unashamedly by now and needed a handkerchief . Paul began to be a little uncomfortable . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once he had begun , Jacques had a great deal to say.  | " I have not yet spoken of our patrons in business . Here M. Plante , Mlle. Zumpt , and Mlle. Louvois will bear me out  --  it would be impossible to find an atmosphere more friendly than the Duchesnes have created at the Maison Bernard . That is what we who have had the honor to work for them know in our hearts . But what the world knows is that the Maison Bernard has done something for Belgium , has proved what Belgian craftsmen and artisans can do , has filled innumerable Belgian homes with beautiful things , has set a standard in price and quality of which we can all be proud . " " Hear , hear , " called Francis in English . He was delighted with Jacques . What a fine boy , how handsome and self-assured ! " I give you , " Jacques finished , " the Maison Bernard and M. and Mme. Duchesne ! " Everyone rose to this and clinked glasses solemnly and then sat down in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A fine young man . " Lou-Lou 's aunt , who had become quite flirtatious by this time , pressed his hand and said , " You should go into politics . " " Yes , yes , " said Paul half to himself , and grinned at Melanie . " Well , " he said to the company at large as he pushed back his chair , " no more champagne , no more speeches . My friends , it 's time we sent the young couple on their way . " It was high time if there was to be anything left of Lou-Lou , who , now she had begun to cry , found it impossible to stop . The taxi was waiting to take them into Brussels . Bo-Bo ran out into the kitchen to get a handful of rice : it might as well begin with all the proper trimmings , even if it was to end badly . Jacques pulled Lou-Lou over to where Croll was standing , lookingvery glum , in a corner . " Wish us luck , Father . Embrace your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deaf to catch what he said . He stared at them with something like anger , made an awkward gesture toward Lou-Lou as if he were going to kiss her , and then instead , as ifp167that would suggest more emotion than he could muster , growled : " Take care of her , you good-for-nothing . " Francoise was not there to see them off . But nobody noticed that . She was in the kitchen stacking up dishes , biting her underlip fiercely to keep from crying . It was all over . There was nothing more to do . " Well , that 's over , thank heavens , " Bo-Bo said dryly when she came back . " We 're going to miss Lou-Lou . She was a good girl , a good worker , " and Bo-Bo sighed . She sat down stiffly by the kitchen table . " Oh , my old bones , " she said . " They 're not much good to me any more , " she said crossly . " Come here , Franci , come here and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Franci , impelled by this familiar voice which had talked to her in that tone since she was a baby , came until she was close enough for Bo-Bo to pull her down on her lap . " Sit on Bo-Bo 's lap and have a good cry . There , there , that 's better , " she said , rocking the great girl as if she were a baby . " That 's right , " she said as Francoise dissolved into tears , crumbled into tears , into childhood again , buried her face in Bo-Bo 's neck , clung to her passionately . " I 'm so lonely , Bo-Bo . I 'm so lonely , " she cried . " There , there , my treasure , my beauty , " Bo-Bo crooned , " my little soul . " The little ones bounded in from the garden and stopped still in the doorway , looking at Franci with frightened , earnest faces : tiptoeing away as Bo-Bo signed to them over Franci 's head . " What 's the matter with her ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . " Is she sick ? " " I do n't know . " They walked hand in hand to the far end of the meadow , as if they had a secret , and when they had talked about it a little they decided to pick Franci a bunch of flowers . " The poppies are all spoiled by the rain , " Colette said in a desolatevoice . " I could give her my red shawl , " Solange said in an ecstasy of self-sacrifice.  | " She would n't like it , " Colette answered sensibly . " Besides , " she went on sadly , " a present wo n't help . " In the house Melanie and Simone could at last have a heart-tohearttalk . It seemed years and years since they had seen each other  --  for Simone had been in Geneva all the winter before and away at a seaside resort all summer . As Melanie seemed more and more rooted here in the house in the country , Simone was moving out into the world . They presented an almost complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in the low armchair , her knees wide apart so the long heavy cotton dress fell in wide folds , her hands clasped between her knees in an almost masculine gesture , the bare feet in sandals showing below her skirt and her brown lined face lit up only by the intent brilliant eyes , her hair pulled back uncompromisingly by the round comb  --  everything about her straight , honest , like a statue of an early saint carved out of wood . Simone lay on the chaise longue , delicate , swathed in gray , carefullymade up , a lace ruffle setting off her throat , a sapphire ring flashing on her perfectly manicured hands , almost impossibly elegantand finished like a porcelain figure , down to the slim aristocraticankle , to the silver buckles on her shoes . What could these two women have to say to each other ? Everything  --  simply everything , for always at every meeting they were astonished by the shock of love . They loved each other deeply , so they could scold each other like two sisters , disagree passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they recognizedat once that they had been starved for each other . And now they were already deep in . " But what a rich life there is here , Melanie ! Whenever I come here , I feel it . The children are wonderful , so absolutely different one from another  --  it must be a daily excitement to watch them growing . " It was Simone 's answer to a depression she felt under Melanie 's words , as if she were tired , as if for a moment she had lost her sense of proportion.  | " The children are everything , " Melanie said . " I live absolutely through and for them . " " And they adore you . " " Yes . " But Melanie was thinking something else as she admittedit . " What it is ? Paul ? " Melanie winced at this . " Paul ? I do n't know . I know nothing about Paul these days . We have both been troubled about Francoise  --  she is really far beyond her age emotionally , you know . " Simone nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , and now she looked out of the window , wondering . She was not a child to whom Melanie 's standards of goodness , of duty , purely ethical standards , could mean much yet . She was certainly an artist like her father . " But , " Melanie went on , thinking aloud , " apart from that communicationwe have about the children , he has walled in his own anxieties and conflict completely as if he had determined not to let me know  --  ever since he came into the business . We hardly talk to each other any more . " " And yet "  --  Simone turned toward her now those marvelous clear gray eyes  --  " yours is one of the few real marriages I know . " " One can get lost , far away from each other , even in a real marriage , " Melanie said quietly . " My darling , you 've always wanted the impossible , believed in the impossible , have n't you ? " But Melanie flashed out at this , " Is it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel included in it ? " " For years at a time , yes . I ca n't imagine having perfect communion with anyone on the deepest level for more than moments now and then . " " I feel such a failure , " Melanie said with fierce pride . " Nonsense , do n't be a goose . " Simone could be quite tough when necessary . It was this toughness at the center that always surprised people who were deceived by her fragile appearance.  | " You do n't know . " When Melanie looked worried and stubborn , unlike most women , she suddenly looked very young . " Any woman who has three magnificent daughters growing up around her and has managed to make life possible for an irascible , temperamental genius of a husband and kept a business going has no right to use the word failure . I 'm a failure if you like , but it would never occur to me to think so , " she added with a mischievoussmile . " You are a goose , my dear , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simone , it 's been such a strange summer ! " Melanie burst out , brushing aside all that Simone said . " Why strange ? " " Full of emotion . " Simone laughed aloud . " You think that because you live out here in the country all by yourselves that you can somehow shut out emotion . What 's wrong with emotion ? You should n't certainly be afraid of it , my darling . " " No , I 'm not afraid . But all this summer we have been getting more and more isolated from each other . The children are upset and do n't tell me what the matter is . Colette has looked ill for days at a time . Francoise imagines she is in love with Jacques . " Simone leaned forward at this and said , " Ah , " softly , as if that explained something she had wondered about . " Paul  --  " Here Melanie stopped so violently it was as if she had put a hand up to her mouth . " What about Paul ? " Simone asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , he spends hours and hours up in the studio in town talking to Mlle. Louvois . He 's not in love with her  --  at least I do n't think so  --  but , " Melanie said in the cold dry voice of a person determined not to cry , " it 's so humiliating that he can talk to her and not to me . It 's that , " she said , making a helpless gesture , letting her two hands fall into her lap with a sort of despair . Simone looked away , out of the window again . Colette andp171Solange were throwing green apples at a mark on a tree  --  their feet must be soaked through in that long wet grass , she thought . " Yes , " she said out of the silence , " that 's hard . But you know , of course , that one can never talk to the person one loves most . They 're too involved , too easily hurt . " " It should n't be like that , " Melanie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Simone shrugged her shoulders . " I shall never accept it . " Simone looked over at her humorously , " No , I do n't expect you will , " she said dryly . " But what is it all for , Simone ? " Melanie asked earnestly , like a schoolgirl , with all that innocence and fiery purity that was in her . " If you ca n't share the important things with your own children , with your husband , what is there left ? " Simone threw up her hands . " Oh , do n't ask me that . You know far better than I , my darling , for you really live out all these questions , live them out with genius . " She looked at Melanie thoughtfully , as if this speech , which had sounded a little formal , was only to make way for something more . " But , darling , " she went on , " you must n't live absolutely through and for the children , as you said just now that you did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for ? " " You ca n't possess the children , Melanie . " " I do n't want to , " Melanie said quickly . " I wonder . " " Oh , you do n't understand anything , " she said crossly . And then , because Melanie was too honest to let that stand , she added , with a rueful smile , " I guess you 're right , Oh , Simone , how hard it is to live the good life ! " With that they both laughed . For a wild moment Melanie wished passionately that she was elegant and slim and had silver buckles on her shoes , that she did not have to get up at five in the morning , that there was no mortgage to meet , that she did not have her own life at all . She got up and stretched , and as she got up , caught sight of Solange , sitting in the wet grass feeding the goat green apples . She pushed open the window and called im-periously , " Solange , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to get wet when you went out . Saperlipopette ! " " I refuse to be very worried about you , Melanie , " Simone said , catching her hand and pulling her down beside her on the sofa . " You 're too deep in the midst of life . " Melanie turned and hugged Simone and smiled . " You mean , " she said , " that there is no escape ? " Upstairs in Paul 's study , among the clouds of smoke , Francis was sitting on the desk swinging his legs , trying to get a word in edgewise as the torrent of Paul 's eloquence poured out . As always when he had been with people , Paul was excited , full of ideas , way up in the air . He had been walking up and down for the past hour , talking as if he might die tomorrow and he must tell Francis everything that was in his mind . Finally , exasperated , Francis broke in angrily , " My dear man , please let me finish one sentence before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leather armchair and took a long puff of the excellent cigar Francis had given him . " All right , I 'll give you five minutes , but do n't ask me to believe anything you say . " Francis threw a matchbox he had been playing with down on the floor . " You 're impossible . " " All right , I 'll be quiet , but while you 've been rushing around to Geneva , to Paris , to Berlin , I 've been sitting here in this room listening to the radio . I have been listening to Mr. Musso and Mr. Adolf and their friends and companions and to our Flemish nationalists here . " " But surely you do n't take them seriously , " Francis broke in impatiently . He never could understand what it was about Paulp173that forced him to listen  --  after all , he was a crank . That was clear enough . " They are symptoms , my dear Francis , and it 's by studying symptoms that one learns about a disease . The disease is an exasperatednationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on coolly . But this statement seemed to enrage Francis . He got up and shook his fists in the air , in a passion of anger and disbelief , and shouted , " No ! " " We can all shout No , ' Francis , that is easily done . " Paul was amused . He loved Francis dearly . He enjoyed making him angry , but , as usual , they got nowhere . The leopard does n't change his spots even if you throw a bottle of ink at him . And Paul recognized perfectly that it was men like Francis , who believed and fought for the impossible , who made an inch of progress possible  --  though they must always think in terms of miles . Francis lifted his hands over his head , open now , as if he had abandoned the fight , and let them fall . " All right , have it your way . I 'm not going to argue with you . " Then they laughed at each other happily as Francis sat down again on the desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life to them both , taking them back to schooldays . " Yes , yes , " Paul said , " yes , yes  --  " " You have n't told me a thing about yourself , Paul . " Francis turned to him earnestly . " What are you working on ? " Paul blew a smoke ring , then another , watching them , with great interest , float up into the air and get wider and wider before they vanished . " See , " he said in a mocking voice ; the harsh lightness , Francis knew , was Paul 's armor , the shield he held up when he was troubled in mind . " Yes , I see  --  a very pretty little trick . What of it ? " " It 's the perfect image of my work , a ring of smoke in the air . You can put your finger in the hole for a moment and then it is n't there . "  | " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " Paul shrugged and smiled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardinal . " I 'll try again . Imagine a tightrope walker who has got it into his mind that he will be able to do his whole act without a wire , in the air . He is obsessed with this idea . He becomes a virtuoso on the high wire because now he imagines all the time that it is n't there at all  --  and yet he ca n't bring himself to make the attempt . The trick is faith . Without faith he will fall and be killed . You see ? " Paul grinned . " No , " said Francis crossly . " Oh well , let it pass . I ca n't talk about my work . It only exists here , " said Paul , tapping his forehead . " Lunatics believe they are Napoleon . I have the illusion which you kindly call my work . ' The truth is I have n't done anything , written a word for four years . " Paul was still smiling , still holding up the shield . " But you will , my dear Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss , and then went on , glad to have thought of something definite and practical . " You have no idea how your reputation is growing , in spite of your obstinate refusal to help yourself in any way  --  in Paris the other day Percheron , of the Academy , spoke of you in the warmest terms . " " He 's a kind old fool . " And then Paul threw down the shield and got up and faced Francis . " Do n't you see , Francis , old friend , the struggle is with myself , against myself ? I do n't care what people say . The part of me that matters does n't care . It 's in here , " he said , hitting his head now with his fist . " There is the agony and the emptiness and the defeat . Oh , Francis , you do n't know , you ca n't imagine what these years have been . The only thing that 's kept me sane has been the business , making myself useful , helping Melanie a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis brightened . He was really enormously sensitive tosuffering . It was out of his sensitivity to it , his fear of it , that hewas such an optimist . " That is wonderful , Paul , really wonderful . " " In one sense wonderful  --  in another , a nightmare . For I'vep175wasted these years , thrown them away , as far as my real life is concerned . They have been nothing . Melanie knows , of course  --  and that only makes it worse . Because I ca n't talk to her . " " Why not ? " Paul shrugged . " Why make her suffer ? She ca n't help me there . And nothing is harder for Melanie than to see someone suffering and not to be able to help them . Her whole life is based on the idea that one can and must help , that it is failure not to be able to . Ca n't you see how impossible it all is ? " he asked angrily . After a moment Paul went on more quietly . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing and therefore I must be saved . I must have peace of mind . What she will never understand is that there are regions of the mind where ethical standards become simply meaningless , at least ethical standards in the sense of rules for the good life ' she is so fond of talking about . " Paul looked up and caught a fleeting expression , a troubled expression on Francis 's face ( what an endearing fellow he is , Paul thought ) . " Oh , I know , I should n't talk about Melanie like this . She is a fine woman and I love her . That simply has nothing to do with it . That is the plane of living . That is all very simple and clear . I love my wife . We have three beautiful children . We have an interestingbusiness which manages to keep us alive , more or less . All that is concrete , positive . Then throw in X , the unknown quantity  --  thiscrazy compulsion to think . " Paul laughed to himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't it ? " he asked savagely , but Francis interrupted him before he could go on . " What I do n't understand , Paul , is why you ca n't do both  --  why does it have to be one or the other ? Why must a normal life exclude philosophy ? Surely other people have managed  --  Spinoza  --  " At this Paul sat down despondently . " Yes , yes , you 're quite right , of course . " He turned to Francis half humorously . " Do you think I 'm crazy ? " " Maybe you are . But you know , Paul , what always strikes me when I come here is how much life goes on in this house . You said something about the good life ' just now , as if the good life excludedconflict , was some calm port of arrival like Fra Angelico 's Paradise . I have an idea that it would be nearer the truth to define it as a life lived always close to the point of conflict . " " In that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think that even you , Francis , would not bring yourself to admit that . " That night , after everyone was in bed , after the long exciting day , with Lou-Lou safely married , and all the dishes washed , with the house settled down again and Paul creeping in to bed at midnight , there was in spite of everything a great feeling of peace . He reached over for Melanie 's hand and held it gently in his own . She was already asleep . " Yes , yes , " he said to himself . PART THREEAutumn : 1936p179Melanie 's head waswhirling ; she might have had arms and legs of lead , so heavy did she feel when she woke up . But she could n't be ill  --  that was quite impossible with Bo-Bo leaving and so much to be done . And if she could n't be ill , she must be well . So she got up even earlier than usual and pampered herself by making a cup of tea before she went out into the garden . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lain for an hour , wide awake , with a pit of lonelinessin her stomach and her head on fire . Of course it was only right that Bo-Bo should be leaving  --  the children were grown-up : her work as a governess was finished and they could hardly expect her to stay on as housemaid and cook , which is what it amounted to . But Melanie , looking out into the garden , lost in mist , felt desolate . It was as if a sister , a close member of her family , were dying . She unlocked the heavy front door and stood for a moment under the arbor . She shivered , but it was not only the cold breath of the early morning mist that made her shiver , it was the magic of the garden . Everything close to the ground was lost in swirls ofp18o white mist , only here and there the shriveled stalk of a Canterbury bell stood above it and quite close to her in the near bed a single deep red rose , like the rose in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had flowered in the night . The bushes , the trees had melted away into ghosts of themselves . This was one garden , but then when she lifted her eyes there was a whole other garden high up in the air where the sun caught the treetops  --  a clear , brilliant garden of leaves and the light on pale yellow and deep gold . The mystery and the cold breath of autumn vanished up there into a radiant morning . The goats and ducks heard her sabots on the path and interruptedthese reflections with loud whinnies and quacks . " I 'm coming . I 'm coming , my beasties , " she murmured , clattering across the stone court behind the kitchen to start the business of the day . An hour later the autumn ravages in the garden were fully illuminatedin the sun and Melanie was hard at work stacking the bean poles , with piles of rotting stalks and leaves around her . Every time she stopped to catch her breath she saw something else that needed doing  --  it was time to rake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps one of the children would find time for it this week . They did their best to help her , but now they were all three studying very hard at school  --  and Croll had died the year before . Poor old Croll . He really died of grief because he had had to stop working . His rheumatism kept him in bed . It was autumn then too . And she had tried to cheer him by asking his advice about the garden in great detail , but he had only shaken his head and shut his eyes and growled something she could not hear . The fact was that he could n't bear to think that it would all go on without him , that they could actually manage by themselves though he had poured his life into every tree and bush and plant for thirty years . He would have liked it better if she had come to tell him that everything was going to ruin , a jungle , a desolationMelanie rubbed ' an arm across her forehead . She was sweating very much and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? shep181thought . The garden was suddenly huge and ominous , as if it would swallow her up , conquer her at last . Even the spade felt heavy , and the sunlight hurt her eyes . A crow cawed noisily and persistently somewhere down the road . She felt for a moment so dizzy that she leaned gratefully on the spade ; its worn handle was the one solid object in a world that whirled and dissolved all around her . She thought rapidly , " It 's Thursday . If I can hold out until Saturday , I can take a day in bed on Sunday , " and with this promise she forced herself to walk quickly and normally to the shed and put away the spade . She scratched Moise 's head . " I feel awfully queer , old lady  --  we 're not as young as we were , not as nimble , eh ? " The cold nose felt delicious in her burning hand . The children were grown-up now . It always came to her as a little shock to have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and although Colette and Solange were still called " the little ones , " they were big girls , Solange as pretty as ever , with the pinkest cheeks in the world and the bluest eyes , clear , clear blue eyes which always seemed to be dreaming and never did quite concentrate on the business at hand . And Colette tall and thin and pale , a little straggly , a little too serious  --  Melanie saw to it that she got an extra portion of everything . She had been having headacheslately  --  perhaps she had grown too fast . Perhaps she was making too great an effort to be the head of her class . The minute Melanie came into the house she was greeted by cries of : " Mamie , may I pick the rose for Bo-Bo ? " ( from Colette ) , and , " Mamie , look ! We 've wrapped up the gloves in a magnificent package  --  we stole the red ribbon from your box , is it all right ? " ( from Solange ) , and , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel unwrapped ? " ( from Francoise , who had painted a water color of the view from Bo-Bo 's own window ) . " Mamie ! Mamie ! Mamie ! " their voices cried , high-pitched with excitement , covering her with morning hugs and kisses , pulling her this way and that to see and approve first one thing and then another.  |p182And  then , " Shh ! She 's coming ! " " Well , children "  --  Bo-Bo gave a very good imitation of impatience to hide her emotion  --  " you are making enough noise to rouse the dead this morning . Is this a menagerie ? " The little ones howled with laughter . " Is this a menagerie ? " The phrase had sounded through their childhood . Everyone was shoutingand laughing a little louder than usual to cover up the hole , to put off the heart-bursting grief of Bo-Bo 's leaving . They were almost relieved when Papa finally came down in a fearful temper and forced them to be quiet . For a moment they sipped their coffee in silence while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Francoise 's painting . In six years she had aged . Her bright blue eyes looked out of a wrinkled face . Her hair was as frizzy as ever ( for she put it up in curlers every night ) , but it was almost white , and she had to move slowly , she who had always run everywhere . They had begged her to stay on , but she was too proud to stay  --  in a house where she had always carried a great burden of work  --  and be unable to maintain her own standards . And then  --  she had not confessed this  --  she looked forward to resting . All her life she had never stayed in bed for breakfast . She had never been spoiled ; she was looking forward to certain small comforts at her sister 's . She would miss the children more than she dared to imagine , but she would sleep late in the morning . In six years Bo-Bo 's fiery will had been tempered by pain . She was an old woman now , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and was glad to choose comfort . For the first time in her life she would live for herself . She would enjoy not through the pleasures of others but through her own . Instead of mending stockings in the evenings , she would be able to read . She would read philosophy and poetry  --  she would even read novels . With these thoughts Bo-Bo had armed herself against the wrench of leaving  --  and of course she would be coming back very often to see them . This was taken for granted.  | " You 'll come on Sunday , Bo-Bonne , " Melanie pleaded . " And scold us for all the things we 've forgotten ! " Solange added mischievously . The sun poured in on the breakfast table . It was a temptation to sit and sip the big cups of coffee slowly , to linger as if it were a Sunday . But Paul was already impatient to be off . " Is your trunk ready , Bo-Bo ? " He looked at his watch . " We have to leave in ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to pull the worn leather straps tight and carry it down . Francoise started to clear away , and Paul walked past the windows muffled in scarfs , wearing a thick leather jacket like armor . Soon the explosions , the whines , and hopeful put-put-puts of the old car trying to get started warned everyone to hurry . But Melanie was still sitting at the table and so was Bo-Bo . " Hurry up , Mamie , " Francoise called as she dashed through to collect her brief case . Every morning it seemed as if they could never get off in time , and by the time the whole family  --  complete with books and pencils and coats and gloves , with packages of vegetables from the garden for the two demoiselles and the jeans  --  were packed into the car , Paul was usually in a fury and everyone'sheart was beating fast . It was a drama they all secretly enjoyed , which started the day off at a proper pitch of excitement  --  excitement which rose in a crescendo until they got into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped off at school . The car was backed out of the garage now , and Paul blew the horn loudly . This was the second phase of his impatience , the danger signal . Usually it would have galvanized Melanie into action  --  thelittle ones went past the window dragging Bo-Bo 's trunk behind them and Paul got out to supervise its strapping onto the running board . Francoise called , " Wait for me ! " from the bathroom window . And then Bo-Bo , who had gone out into the hall to put on her hat , came back . " I 'm not going . "  | " But , Bo-Bo . . . " Melanie protested weakly . For the last half hour she had felt too ill to hide it any more . But Bo-Bo paid no attention . She pushed the window open and called out : " Never mind about the trunk . I 'm not going . " The two children dropped the trunk in amazement as Paul muttered , " Satre nom d'un , " and got back into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard . " Madame is ill . You run along , all of you , and I 'll stay here  --  never mind about the trunk . It can stay where it is , " and before they could protest she had slammed the door of the car and shouted , " Hurry up or you 'll be late for school ! " Three anxious faces looked back and waved through the little window at the back . Paul turned to Francoise in the seat beside him and asked : " What is the matter with everyone this morning ? Has Bo-Bo gone crazy ? " But no one answered him . It was better to be silent , safer . But a few moments later he turned to Francoise again and asked anxiously , " Do you think Mamie is really ill ? I did n't noticeanything . " Mamie ill ? It seemed quite impossible . She had never been ill in her life , not really ill . Solange was desperately going over her Latin lesson with a last hope that she might be able to remember about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and bronze leaves in the gutters . The day which had started so well had gone all queer . She felt sick to her stomach . But at home Melanie was lying in bed with a thermometer in her mouth and a delicious hot-water bottle at her feet , so glad to be able to lay down the burden of her body that it seemed the most exquisite happiness just to be lying still in a soft bed and not haveto move . " Oh , Bo-Bo , " she said with a sigh of contentment , " I believep185I 'll go to sleep . " And then , as Bo-Bo 's impassive face registered nothing of what she read on the thermometer , " Well ? " " Four degrees of fever , madame . When will you learn to take care of yourself ? Out in the garden this morning working with a fever like that ! " Melanie smiled . " I did n't know what was the matter with me . " " Well , now you know , you are not going to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The doctor ? Is that necessary ? " Bo-Bo laid a cool hand on her forehead , cool and dry as a piece of wood worn smooth by the sea . " Go to sleep now , " she said softly , and for a second Melanie felt and saw her mother so vividly behind her closed eyes that she did not want to open them . She just murmured , " You spoil me , Bo-Bonne , " and then she must have fallen asleep . For when she woke up the afternoon sun was streaming through the closed green curtains so that the whole room seemed to be under water . Her legs ached and there was a weight on her chest , but she felt inexpressibly happy and at peace , so much so that she began to weep . She had been dreaming about her mother . For so long , for years , there had not been a day when she could remember this sort of relaxation and peace , when the images of the past could float up into her consciousness  --  that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had needed to lie still . She had been cut off from whole layers of herself , the layers of experience and remembrance which nourish the present . Now , between sleeping and waking , uninterrupted by Bo-Bo 's silent attentions , the hot bowl of soup , the fresh hot-water bottle , the knowing cool hands plumping up her pillow  --  she abandoned herself to the necessity of daydreaming . On the roof the doves cooed persistently or flapped noisily down to the window sill . A streamer of sunlight lay across Paul 's bed through the slight crack in the curtains , but she was far away in the sea-green gloom , her open eyes looking inward.  | To go back into her childhood was a rest , not because it was childhood ( which has never been a restful time in anyone 's life ) but because she was a child in a peaceful world . School had meant passionate friendships which took her to Switzerland , to Italy , and England for long romantic summers . She and her friends had a sense of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves exceptional lives  --  and politics was only part of the great hope of her youth . For had n't they all taken for granted and believed that the nations were moving naturally toward world socialism ? Of course it had to be fought for  --  reforms were needed everywhere . She had worked hard for workmen 's compensation , for free clinics , but all these things would come to pass in time . War was unknown  --  progress was inevitable ; while all over Europe young people like herself , on fire for justice , plunged into the struggle . Remembering the sweetness , the extravagance of it all , she thought of her own children with a fearful tenderness . They had grown up in a world savage with hatred and spiritually and economicallydepleted . And what had she given them with which to endure and make a life in this world ? Character , perhaps . Yes , they were hard workers , all three , even Solange , in spite of her intellectual problems  --  andin Francoise a kind of indifference . For Francoise was throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She refused absolutely to be drawn into any discussions at home . She simply fled to her big table in the veranda and went to work painting flowers or , since she had entered the school of design , on one of her architectural projects . She had reacted to the uncertainty and trouble of her world by simply shutting it out . And she could do this because she had a real talent , a talent which would possess her . But she was not , Melanie thought compassionately , a very warm or considerate human being . And Paul , of course , had for years withdrawn into his work ; given up any effort to change or take part in any change outside it ;  |p187fastened  his whole mind to metaphysical exercises ; nailed himself down to a set of ' spiritual problems which had as much connection with daily life as algebra . Melanie turned over on her stomach and laid her cheek on the cool pillow . These reflections which had begun so peacefully and sprung from the heart were taking her into a maze of conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . She was suddenly very aware of the stillness of the house . It stood all around her , the walls , the ceilings , the big staircase outsidein the hall , the sturdy brick walls and the tiled roof  --  steadfast , supporting her as the bed on which she lay supported her , and she alone vulnerable and alive . One could try at least to build and maintain a framework of certainty , , of security for the children , like a house ; and then was n't it matter of living from day to day ? It seemed a curiously conservative end to the wild dreams of her youth  --  to be content to build her life within this house , within this garden , to feel so supported by them . But she wondered sometimesif her dreams had not been a man 's dreams  --  and even her young life of passionate free attachments to women , a young man 's life . And now she was a woman and this was a woman 's life . After a whole day in bed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the children 's voices in the hall : they must have come back early by trolley to see how she was . They were tiptoeingup the stairs , and she called out : " Come in , my treasures ! " They came in , subdued and anxious , with a bough of crimson maple leaves for her to see . And she thought with a pang , They look shabby  --  I really must manage to get them each a new suit this winter . " I have been having a wonderful lazy day , sleeping and being spoiled . " " Bo-Bo says you must stay in bed at least a week and we are not to let you get up . " They looked absurdly troubled.  | " I 'm not really ill , you know . Just a little fever , probably grippe . It 's nothing . Sit on the bed and tell me about school . " Solange burst into a long story of the whole day , how miraculous it was that she was n't called on in Latin because she had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just , which seemed much more triumphant somehow than if she had had a high mark ) , how Mlle. Treillere had stopped her in the hall and complimented her on her theme about autumn in the garden . But Colette was silent , observing her mother with quiet attention . " Come along , " she said when they had been there about a half hour . " Mamie must rest . " Yes , it was foolish to be so tired after a whole day in bed . She could rest again as the shell of the house filled with the murmur of voices ; doors banged ; the rake scratched far off in the garden ; there was water running in the taps again ; a plaintive mew dragged Melanie out of bed to let Fifi , the daughter of Filibert , in to find a soft place in the bed and purr and dig her claws into the eiderdownecstatically . Soon Paul would be home ... . But downstairs nothing seemed right . There was an awful emptiness in the kitchen , where Solange was peeling potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything seemed easy and fun  --  the evening chores were a game they played together . Now they were just chores . It was lonely in the kitchen , lonely in the garden , lonely everywhere , as the pigeons seemed to repeat relentlessly over and over . " Colette , come and help me , " Solange called . But her voice came back from far off : " I have to finish raking this path . You feed the animals , Little  --  and milk the goats , will you ? " It was cold and almost dark when Solange went out into the court and clattered across it to the safety and warmth and the close animal smell of the goat shed . What if Mamie were to die ? She stopped milking and leaned her head against Molse 's warm flank . Of course that was not going to happen  --  she knew it her/self . But in the last few hours she had been aware for the first time of how much Melanie held the whole fabric of their lives together . Without her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  everything seemed to have lost its reason for being . There was panic and emptiness and darkness instead of life and warmth and safety . What would Mamie think if she knew I had so little courage ? she asked herself , and went back to milking , quickly and deftly , for Solange had a sure touch with animals . Morse would never stand as still as that for anyone else . When she went back into the house with the pail of warm milk and saw Bo-Bo standing at the stove stirring the soup , she felt ashamed of her moment of wild grief . In the bright light of the kitchen , she saw it was foolishness . But in the shed she had realized something about their lives that she had never had to face before : someday Melanie would die ; one 's parents do not live forever ; eventually one must stand alone . And she felt fearfully unprepared . I must grow up , she said to herself . I must learn many things I do n't know . I must be ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look so serious all of a sudden . " Colette noticed at once that she had changed as they sat peeling potatoes in the small dining room . " I 've been thinking about our lives . " " What about them ? " " Well , " she said , and then stopped , because now it was to be put into words , she did n't know exactly what she had been thinking ; it had been a sensation of loneliness and independence , and how did people speak of sensations , except in poetry ? " I was thinking about growing up  --  how hard it is , " she added lamely , and blushed . It was unusual for Solange to reveal anything of her inner life . She was the clown and the baby of the family , and she had accepted her role passively until now , partly because she enjoyed it and partly out of a deep lack of confidence in herself . Colette was so much more articulate and intellectual . " I was thinking about Mamie , " she went on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her more than we have . "  | Colette nodded quickly . " I wish we were older . " She understoodso much more than she was able to do now . She was tied down by lessons ; there never seemed to be time for the real things any more  --  poems and reading and gardening and the long talks they used to have with their mother about ethics and conduct and what was right and the meanings of things . " There seems to be so little time for living . " " Mamie wanted to be an actress when she was a little girl , " Solange said apparently irrelevantly . " What made you think of that ? " " I was just thinking how differently people 's lives turn out from what they plan . " " Oh . " Colette leaned her chin on her hand and looked off through the walls of the little orange room and out into the darknessbeyond . She herself did not know what she wanted . Once she had wanted to write poems more than anything  --  now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done in the world  --  how did one have the right ? She had lost the beauty she had as a child  --  she looked sallow and worn beside Solange 's rosy fresh color . Her serious mouth , her deep thoughtful eyes , would come into their own much later . But this autumn was an autumn of conflict for Colette and she felt tired all the time . Just as she was about to speak they heard the roar of the car and ran out to open the doors of the garage and help Paul unload . " Hello , Papa , did you have a good day ? " " Hello , my birds , how is Mamie ? " " She 's been sleeping all day  --  she has a fever . " They watched him pull off his gloves and blow on his hands , as if he would never be really warm , and then turn to the car with a sigh and hand out one bundle after another . " Where 's Francoise ? " Colette asked . " Oh , she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late tonight . Run along , you 'll catch cold . You 've no business to be here without sweaters on . "  |p191It  was the same as always , and yet it was different . When Mamie was there , the evening arrival semed always the end of all sorts of adventures , the end of a real journey ; there was always so much to tell . It was the gayest and best moment in the whole day . There was always a surprise or a joke  --  an extra something for supper , a cake or a half pound of ham , or something wonderfulor amusing that had happened and with which Melanie would regale her family . Now they finished unpacking in silence , having paid no attention to their father 's remarks about cold . But when he had come in and extricated himself from the heavy leather coat , the scarf , the hat , and blown once more into his thin frozen hands , he looked at them tenderly and patted their heads . " My good little girls , my angels , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round them and they were safely home . Paul stood at the end of the bed and looked down at Melanie . She had flung an old white cashmere shawl that belonged to her mother round her shoulders , and as he stood and looked down , talking to her tenderly , he felt ashamed . How long it was since he had talked to her like this or felt so romantically and passionatelyabout his wife ! And she on her side felt as shy as a young girl , too exposed before his gaze , so she moved uneasily in the bed and laughed a little self-consciously . " I 'm not your swan . I 'm your goose , my darling  --  your silly goose to get ill like this just when there is so much to do . " " It 's time you learned that you 're not indispensable . You 'd be astonished to learn how well we got on without you , " he teased . " I do n't want you to get on well without me , " she said , frowninglike a peevish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stroked her forehead and told her that the whole world would fall to pieces without her and all the cities vanish in the winking of an eye and there be nothing left at all  --  and this , just this , was what she wanted to hear . " Myp192darling wife , " he said , kissing her smooth forehead , and then , as she had been doing all day so foolishly , she began to weep . " Do n't pay any attention . I 've been doing this all day . I 'm so happy . " It did n't make much sense , hilt he understood . He understood , as he would always understand everything , because it was his genius to understand . " You 're tired  --  I 'd better go . " " No , do n't go , " she pleaded . " It 's so long since we 've sat and talked . " Her hands followed the buttons on his waistcoat , and he stayed . After a moment he said thoughtfully , " I had a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked absent-mindedly , for she was thinking of him and wishing they could go off somewhere together . But of course it was impossible . It had always been impossible . But looking up at his face , she saw the change in it . " No , not a good letter , " she answered herself . " Well "  --  he got up restlessly and began walking up and down , picking up first the brush on her bureau and then the little box of lace and putting them down  --  " it sounds as if he 's in trouble . " In a second the safe walls of the house , the love and the tendernessand the security in which she had been cherished all seemed to fade away and her mind pushed out beyond the Belgian frontiers into the darkness and evil across the border , so near and so far away across the night . One shut out the suffering in order to be able to go on living , but it was always there , just across the border , like conscience itself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul went on , " to try to get him out . " " Out ? " Melanie sat up . " Out of Germany  --  for good ? He would n't do it , would he ? " " You 'd better read the letter , Melanie . I did n't mean to bother you with this tonight , " he added , but the fact was that Paul had been unable to think of anything else all day . He handed her the letter apologetically.  | " But , my dear , of course . " She sat up to read . It was dated a week before and had been mailed in Brussels . DEAR PAUL , I am giving this letter to a friend of mine who is coming to Brussels on business . I have not been able to tell you of my difficultieshere . No doubt you can imagine what it is to a professor of philosophy . to be ordered to eliminate Spinoza and Erasmus from his teaching , as well as all foreign-born philosophers . I must confess that in order to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of offering a course in the history of German philosophy which I thought would pass with the " authorities . " I had misjudged the extent to which we are already poisoned . I have resigned my position at the university , and that means that in the course of time , though perhaps not immediately , my life may well be in danger . From now on I shall be watched . I have stayed until . now partly because I have been able to help several Jewish colleagues to escape by being here . Now there seems no reason to prolong the agony of separation from my country , my wife , and my son . Hans is a convinced Nazi and now at an S.S. Elite training school . My wife will not leave her son . You can imagine that my decision has been a difficult one . But now it is made , the sooner I am able to act on it , the better for everyone concerned . I do not yet know what will be possible  --  there are changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation from the University of Brussels to give a lecture on a " safe " German philosopher like Nietzsche would get me a passport . If this fails , I will have to rely on more dangerous means . Here all is pain and confusion and growing darkness . My dear friend , you and yours are to me at this moment literally light . I think of the evening in your parlor , of your three daughters , of your splendid wife . I hesitate to place the burden of my destiny in your hands . But I do not see any other way of going on with the things in which we both believe and for which we live . Please do n't worry about me if you do n't hear again for several weeks . i have still some good friends here . Fear is the greatest corrupter but it has not touched all Germans yet . Believe me , your always devotedGERHART SCHMIDTp194Melanie laid the letter down on the sheet . " Oh , Paul " " Yes , it 's bad . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . Oh , Paul , " she said again . There were no tears in her eyes now . " What can we do right away ? " she asked then , sitting up as if she would get up and dress and put on her hat in an instant . " Lie down , darling , " Paul said , coming back to the bed . " The awful thing is that short of the invitation from the university , which I saw to this afternoon  --  they were most co-operative , by the way ; perhaps old Terborch is n't such a dried-up fossil as I have always imagined him to be  --  short of that , I do n't see anything to do but wait . " " Think of him , that quiet gentle man . What he has been through  --  What monsters ! " she said violently . And then more quietly , " Oh , Paul , the children " " Yes , the children , " he said harshly . " Our little Hans , whom we thought so well-brought-up and well-disciplined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torture . " " How will he stand it ? How can he ? " Paul stood at the window and looked out into the darkness of the garden . " The trouble is that it 's far easier to stand it than not to stand it . It 's far easier to torture than to be tortured  --  and the pressure on young boys in Germany now must be unbelievable . I wonder how many suicides there are : it would be interesting to have the figures . " Melanie watched his intellect at work with a kind of amazement . Even in a moment like this he moved instinctively toward the abstract . She was thinking , if it were my child  --  what then ? What if Hans were her son , as she had so often half pretended that he was . What would one do ? I must get well . I must be about , she thought in sudden panic  --  as if there were hardly time now to prepare her own children for the future . One must ask more of them than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love  --  for what a weariness of hatred lay ahead she was beginning to understand , though she did not yet name it " war . " Paul had gone back to his study and opened the door so she could hear Beethoven 's " Seventh Symphony " broadcast from Berlin . But Melanie 's moment of panic and resolution was swallowed up in the week to come by the many things that happened while she was in bed . Afterward she looked back on this week of convalescence  --  it was , after all , only a slight attack of flu , but she stayed in bed because she had a few degrees of fever every night  --  as a sort of vacation , in which , just as if she were on a journey , she could sit back and enjoy her family without any of the responsibilities of the household . Every evening the little ones brought their lessons up to her room ; she heard Solange 's recitations for her and then read aloud to them for an hour . Sometimes , if there were a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they all listened together , and then even Francoise would come up to join them . Best of all , Paul had talked to her one whole afternoon about his new book and what he hoped to do . It was a long time since he had been willing to let her know at all what he was thinking about , and she had not even known that he was planning a new book . That was the best news of all . All these things pushed Schmidt into the background  --  at least until the university should have an answer to the invitation to lecture . They could do nothing until then . Then she also had a chance to read  --  a new biography of Mme. du Deffand , several volumes of Sainte-Beuve 's Causeries du Lundi , which she had missed , and a life of Horace Walpole in Englishp196which Paul found for her in a secondhand bookstore . They all vied with one another to invent things to amuse her and spoil her : Simone arrived one morning with a basketful of goodies , a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a glass jar , and two pounds of pain d la grecque , speculose , and other specialties which they used to buy in quarter pounds when they were at boarding school and hoard in their bureau drawers . They munched them now , spoiling their lunches completely just as they had used to do , and had a long gay talk about the old days . But in spite of everything there was a distance between them , however hard they tried to re-create their perfect intimacy by remembering it . Was it simply that in spite of her understanding and wisdom Simone 's life was too different from Melanie 's ? She did not have any of the Duchesnes ' material difficulties to face , and sometimes it seemed to Melanie as if these were the very foundationof everything . Whatever she had managed to accomplish had been done in spite of there being no money and no security . So every day of peace was snatched out of peril , and that made it doubly precious . You could n't talk about these things  --  it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupations and triumphs in Simone 's life made her seem far away , on another planet . And then she had no children . This added to the slightly rarefied atmosphere in which she moved . " You know , Simone , it is awful , but I have so little time for readingor just thinking now  --  it 's years since I 've lain like this for hours , doing nothing  --  that I sometimes think I am becoming childish for sheer lack of using my mind ! " Simone had been talking about Gide , whom Melanie hardly knew . But that , of course , was nonsense , as Simone made quite clear at once , pointing out that it would be quite impossible for Melanie to live as she did , working on all sorts of practical social problems , without knowing very well what she was doing and without thinkingout one situation after another . Only last month she had hadp197a long session with the judge at the children 's court about the problems of delinquency . " Well , it 's different  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh well , I do n't know what I mean , darling  --  give me one more of those heavenly pains a la grecque and tell me more about Gide . We are way off the point . " But then Simone wanted to hear all about the children , and Melanie all about Francis . She had expected him to be in the depths of depression , but to her surprise Simone laughed ironically , with a shade of criticism in her laughter , and said : " Yes , you would think so . But do you know , Melanie , he has persuaded himself that Hitler does n't want war . " She shrugged her shoulders . " That is what happens to men when they have an idle fixe . Peace is Francis ' idle fixe , and he simply will not admit the reality . I knew it long ago  --  I think I knew it on the day of Briand 's funeral . Certainly the crowd then , that silent dumb crowd which felt despair rather than grief , mourned for peace as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be another war ? " Melanie 's throat felt so tight and dry she could hardly say the words . " Yes . " Until now , until the other day when Schmidt 's letter came , she had refused to believe it possible . And even now she had a superstitiousfeeling that one must not believe  --  or it would happen . Perhaps that was what made Francis behave as he did . Once more , as she had the first day she was ill , she felt unspeakablytired as if she were made of lead . And when Simone had left she lay for a long time without moving and wondered , as sick people do , how she would ever make the strength to climb back again into the struggle , now that it led surely and inevitably into darkness . Later she decided that she must speak to the children . They must know . And one evening when Solange and Colette were curled up on the bed like cats and Francoise came up to show them her plans for a modern study , Melanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , children , there is something I think we should talk about as a family . " Francoise sat down gingerly on the end of the bed . She hated family talks and she still had a lot of work to do . " Shall I get Papa ? " Colette asked . " Papa is working . We 'd better not disturb him . " But all these preliminaries had made everyone nervous . Had the business gone bankrupt ? Colette wondered . Or was it that one of them had done something so awful that it must be discussedin public ? " Do n't look so solemn , my little owls , " for their six eyes were fastened on Melanie 's face as if they expected some doom . " It 's not as bad as all that . " And then she told them quietly that they must fill these next years as full as possible of all the things they most wanted to do and to be , as there might quite possibly be war . " I feel , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can for the future is very great . This applies to the garden , for instance  --  we must get in supplies of seeds now , and we must clean out the old hives and try to get hold of a swarm of bees . We must gradually become as self-supporting as possible . But it means also , for you children , that you must think ahead . " Now that she was talking about it , it seemed quite unreal to Melanie , and for a moment she wondered if she had been foolish to frighten them . But instead of being frightened they were delighted . They had always loved to make plans , and now here was a chance to make real ones , necessary ones . Solange burst out with the question she had been storing up for months : " Do you think , Mamie , that I could work on a farm next summer ? Then I would be ready to help . " She was blushing furiously , having at last given away her most intimate secret . " Oh , Solange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself could think of nothing . She felt confused . For everything she wanted to do seemed to take such a long time . " I wonder "  --  Melanie 's own eyes were shining now with the possibilities this emergency opened up  --  " I wonder , darling , " she answered Solange , " if it would n't be better to go for the summer to the School of Agriculture  --  they have a model farm and you would learn new methods . " Solange groaned humorously . A school sounded very different from a real farm . Nobody wanted to go to school in the summer . " I tell you what . We 'll get Papa to drive us over there and you shall see for yourself . " " A picnic  --  a picnic on Sunday ! " Colette cried happily . It was years and years since they had had a picnic all together . " Only we must ask Papa  --  perhaps later , as he is working so hard now . Perhaps in the spring . " Their faces fell . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had accepted the idea of war already . It was part of their vocabulary . " We had better get everything settled now . " " Oh , my darlings , I did n't mean that it would happen as soon as all that ! " F'rancoise got up to go . She had been hearing talk of war all year at the school ; there were constant fights among the boys  --  some of them ardent Flamingantistes , already inoculated with Nazi propaganda . ( " Who wants to fight for France ? " they said defiantly . ) She had long ago accepted the fact . It seemed rather naive of her mother to bring it up now . And besides , how would it change her life to think ahead to the war ? One must go on as one had started . There was nothing else to do . " Do n't go , Franci , " the little ones begged . " We want to talk . " " I have to work , " she said shortly . " You 're just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and smiled at them ; they all three seemed to her like children , " You settle the world , my friends  --  I have to work . "  |p200Solange  shook her head . " She works all the time . I ca n't understand it . " Melanie and Colette laughed . " No , I 'm sure you ca n't understand it , " Colette teased , " lazy-bones . " " I hate school , " Solange answered without malice , " and she 's doing what she wants . " Colette looked thoughtful . She played with the fringe of her mother 's shawl . Finally she turned to her mother shyly . " Mamie ? " " What is it , my treasure ? " " Do you think "  --  it was frightfully difficult to ask , now she had come to the point  --  " do you think I could somehow go to England next summer ? " Now she had begun , it all tumbled out . " I could work my way . It would n't cost much , only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling , if that 's what you want to do . " What a wonderful evening it was ! All the things Colette and Solange had secretly hoped and prayed for seemed to be suddenly possible  --  and all because there was going to be a war ! " What I want is to be responsible for the animals , " Solange went on decidedly . " I think we should have sheep . Then we can have the wool and also meat when the lambs come . " But Colette was dreaming about Keats 's house , about great forests , about cathedrals , about Katherine Mansfield 's country and Shakespeare'scountry  --  England ; the word was magic . She would live there . She would see the clipped hedges and the cottage gardens full of flowers , and the green rolling hills and the great oak trees . She climbed over the bed and hugged her mother passionately . " Oh , Mamie , I 'm so happy , " she said . " You ca n't imagine . " That is being young , Melanie thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a great adventure . But in her bed that night Colette lay wide awake and could n't sleep . She felt ashamed of having asked to go to England . If Solange were away at a farm and she went away too , who would help Mamie in the house ? And then if they must really think nowp201about the future and what they wanted to do and how to be preparedif the war came , going to England was just a luxury . For the last year Colette had hoped that something would happen to decide things for her . And now it had come , but it did n't make it any easier . Solange , she thought , was really a saint  --  she wanted so little in life . She was perfectly happy as long as she was allowed to be with animals and plants or helping in the house . She seemed to have no personal ambition . But her own life was nothing but confusion these days . For a year she had hardly written , and her little notebook lay at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her last year 's poems  --  they seemed so childish . Whatever she wrote now she tore up . She had become extremely critical . And then , whenever she had a free hour , there were so many things in the garden and the house that needed doing . She thought sometimes that her conscience had grown too big for the rest of her . As a doctor I know I can be useful , she said to herself , but how do I know I can ever write a really beautiful poem ? Sometimes it seemed as if she could never make up her mind unless she could get away from home , get away from her parents , get away from her awareness of their problems and their relationship . And so England had become an escape , a dreamworld , a place where she could be her real self again , where she could be quiet and released for a while from the immediate pressure of this enormousdecision . England was , in a way , poetry . And that was why now , lying awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so selfishly . Her head was bursting . She felt that in a moment she would scream or throw herself out of the window . It really did occur to her that that would solve everything , and she was in a cold sweat with terror that she would do it . So she ran out of her room , bumping into the door in the dark , and slipped down the stairs , trembling violently . There was a light under her father 's door . " Papa is working . " How often through her childhood those words had meant ,  | " No , we ca n't go on a picnic , " or " Do n't talk so loudly in the hall . " Above all , they meant he must not be interrupted . The linoleum was icy under her bare feet ; she was shaking so much , she was afraid she 'd knock against the stair rail and startle him . Now she was this far , it seemed impossible to go back . Should she instead creep into her mother 's warm bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to rest . That would be worse . Finally she scratched at the door very softly , like a mouse , and waited . There was no sound from inside . So with a sudden movement , brought on by cold and fear , she pushed open the door and closed it softly behind her . He was sitting at his desk , back to her . " Hello there . " He turned and welcomed her as if it were the most normal thing in the world to have his daughter appear in the middle of the night in her nightgown . " Do you mind , Papa , if I just come and sit here a little while ?  --  I wo n't disturb you . I 'll just put on your wrapper . " His beautiful Jaeger wrapper , bought long ago in the good days , hung on the door . " Of course , my bird , my treasure . " He got up and helped her thin arms into the long sleeves . " There , now you look like a monk . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lap and get warm . " She buried her face in his neck , smelling his delicious smell of shaving soap and tobacco , and clung to him passionately , whispering , " Oh , Papa , " over and over , and he rocked her as he had rocked them all through their childish griefs , on his thin pointed knees . After a moment he lifted her chin and looked at the intense face before him . But she did not want to be looked at . She buried her face in his shoulder and clung to him tightly , remembering the peril she had been in . But after a moment she got up and went over to a little stool and sat on it . " You see , Papa , " she said gravely , " I am stuck about my life . "  |p203He  lifted his eyebrows slightly . " Your life , eh ? What about your life ? I admit that one 's life is apt to look a little strange in the middle of the night . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was frowning now , the dark frown which screwed up her face . " Well , we have lots of time  --  let 's talk about it . " She explained then what they had been told about the war and that she had wanted to go to England . " All that seems to me very sensible , my dear . What is troubling you , then ? " She was , he thought , an amazing child . He wondered , counting back rapidly , how old she was exactly  --  for in her ability to analyze herself and others she seemed far older than sixteen . And yet , crouched over on her stool , she looked like a little girl , the little girl who had made nests for field mice and fairies all over the garden , the little girl who wrote poems and was always full of secrets . But she did not talk like a little girl . " How is one to decide , Papa , between serving poetry and serving life itself ? " Paul laughed ; the pointed thrust of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " That 's a pretty big question to try to solve in the middle of the night . I do n't wonder you were frightened . " " Oh , I was n't frightened of the question . I was frightened because it seemed impossible to decide without betraying something . I mean , I have always wanted to be a poet . But lately I ca n't write any more , so how can I know any more ? How can I know what is right , Papa ? " " Do n't you think , darling , " he asked gently , " that it 's perhaps a mistake to try to force a decision now ? You 're still very young . Many people write poems when they 're your age and then stop as they grow older . " " But I do n't want to stop ! " She besought , not him , but her destiny itself . " That 's just what 's so terrible . "  | " No one is forcing you , are they ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were clenched with the effort of explaining . " You see , I want to be useful . " " Yes , yes , " Paul murmured . He understood her struggle so well , but he was surprised that she should have come to it so young . This was the crisis he had been through only ten years ago , when he was thirty  --  when he had decided to try to help Melanie in the business . At Colette 's age most young people would be thinking of expressing themselves without too much sense of responsibility to the world at large . This was Melanie 's doing , of course , with her high standards of behavior , her uncompromising ideals . He did not like it . " Yes , yes , " he said again . " If I am not a poet I want to be a doctor  --  a children 's doctor , and if so , I would have to begin choosing my courses at the universityfor that , next year . You see , I do have to decide , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then when Mamie said the war might come I thought : I want to be ready . " " I think you must n't worry too much about the war . I think we shall have to go on living as if there were to be peace  --  there is nothing else we can do . And , my darling , life does n't stop for a war . There will be plenty to be done afterward , and perhaps it is for that you should be getting ready . We ca n't accelerate our lives now beyond the normal . That would be false , and perhaps even fatal . No , what you must come to discover is where your own deepest need lies  --  that is hard enough . " " Yes , Papa . " " You would n't be a very good doctor , you know , if you only did it out of a sense of duty without a real vocation . " " I know . Oh , Papa , if I only believed I could be a poet ! " she said passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Colette , " he said , for the first time severely , because he felt that here he was combating Melanie 's absolute ideas . " We live by faith in the end , not by reason . If you are a real poet you 'll never be sure  --  there 'll always be the enormous risk to take , the risk that you are following a will-o ' - the- wisp , asp205my father used to say . And you may not even know when you die , whether you had the right to take the risk . I do n't expect to know , " he added with a bitter smile . So there was , after all , to be no answer tonight . Paul looked at Colette observantly . " My darling , come here , come to Papa . " The magnet of love pulled her back to sit once more on his knees , safe in childhood . " You mus n't try to solve these things with your hard-working little mind any more . You must really have a little faith in life itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroking her soft straight hair , " you 'll know what is right . Something will tell you  --  and until then try not to worry too much . You have time , my bird , you have all the time in the world , years and years . I want you to go to England as you planned next summer and enjoy yourself , and not worry any more . " " I 'll try , Papa . " She felt much better now . But still there was no answer . When she had gone , Paul sat looking at the stool where she had been sitting and realized that a child was a witness , and Colette , more sensitive than the others , had always been a silent and tormented witness of his struggle with Melanie , pierced by it as a child might be haunted for a whole lifetime by a single scene of violence . But he and Melanie lived out their conflict  --  it was in a sense the very basis of their marriage , the rock which split them but on which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Colette had only received the impact of the conflict like a bruise  --  she was trying desperately to be both her mother and her father in one person . Every flaw , every hesitation , every compromise in him or in Melanie he saw now was reflected in Colette 's enormous eyes as if they were an enlarging mirror . And then he remembered Louise . He had thought of Louise as his own problem . Now he realized that any problem of his became imperceptibly the children 's problem as well ; consciously or unconsciouslythey stood as witnesses to his life . He sat with his head in his hands for a long time , knowing the whole of his responsibility and what he felt to be the whole of his failure . But upstairs Colette was already fast asleep . If Melanie 's illness lefta hole in the life of the house in the country , at least she was there upstairs , ready to comfort and give advice , to be waited on and cherished . At the business in town everyone felt themselves listeningin vain for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a climate for them all . Now the ice age seemed to have set in . Nothing was right . Mlle. Louvois and Mlle. Zumpt had a tiff . They were not on speaking terms and communicatedentirely through Jean , who got so tired of running up and down stairs that he tried several times to give notice and had to be calmed down by Monsieur . Paul himself had a lot of work to do on the new order . He wanted only to be left in peace at his drawing board , making minute calculations and drawings , and to recite poems while he worked . Instead he found himself drawn into the stupid quarrel downstairs and finally blew up in a rage and ordered the demoiselles to make it up or leave . He stayed , grimly , until he had seen them shake hands , and then went upstairs and banged his door as if to say , " Just dare come up and disturb me again ! " It made Mlle. Louvois very nervous to have to make decisions on her own . The curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green . Would gray be just as suitable ? Would gray be just as suitable ? She asked herself stupidly over and over , and finally hesitated so long that the wholesale house hung up on her . And Mlle. Zumpt , who had of course been listening , smiled . By the end of the morning Louise was close to tears.  |p207She  was no longer an attractive woman . She wore a turban now to hide her graying hair ; she had stopped dyeing it and it had not grown out , so it was a hideous particolored mixture . Her heavy make-up seemed only to emphasize the oldness of the face . Only her clear blue eyes looked incongruously innocent and young , so she reminded Paul sometimes of a Siamese cat . He pitied her so deeply that his pity was very close to tenderness . She had , of course , fallen passionately in love with him and now nursed this hopeless love as she had once nursed and lived by her long love affair . Melanie was shocked that he had allowed such a thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affair at all . What she did n't know was that he had given so much of himself to Louise , had talked to her so intimately of his own problems , that he was himself indebted to her . A real intimacy had existed between them , an intimacy based on their equal unhappiness , and they were bound together by what they knew about each other . He blamed himself bitterly for having fallen into the whole thing . What a sentimental fool he had been ! But after all , he asked himself then , could he have done differently ? A man with a divining rod in his hands can not help it if he is thrown to the ground by the force of the current when he is led to it . He had a very real power to understand and to help . Could one deny this power , refuse to use it when a human being was in trouble ? He was annoyed with himself for thinking so much about her . He was aware of her downstairs all the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door . When she finally did it was nearly time for lunch . " Sit down , Louise  --  and have a cigarette . I 'll be with you in a moment . I hope Mlle. Zumpt and you have come to your senses . " " Oh , it 's been a fine morning . " She laughed ironically . " Madame will be in a fury when she comes back and finds what a mess everything is in . " In six years they had grown used to each other . And for Louise the best moments now were these , when she could sit quietly while he worked , and smoke a cigarette in peace . At such times she felt herself keenly alive  --  she thought of many things which never came to her mind when she was alone . For she was a woman who would never be completely herself except through another person , within a relationship . And for all its outward slightness , this was a real relationship and one which fully occupied her heart . Strange , she thought as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the intoxication of the smoke in her lungs , looking out as she had done a million times on the red tiled roofs opposite and the row of pigeons  --  six years of her life were framed by this static scene  --  strange how in a novel it would be inconceivable that she should still be sitting here . No writer , she thought , half amused at the idea , would dare to hold two people in such suspense for so long a time . Once , on some warm spring evening , he would have kissed her ; or , more likely , the , tension would have exploded finally in a quarrel and she would have left the business , as indeed she had thought of doing many times . But a real life was so much longer and more obscure than a life in any novel , for the novelist inevitably looks to the few moments of crisis to illuminate his characters , whereas , she thought , character is really developed and matured in the interminable spaces between . In six years Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still she sat here looking at the red roofs and the pigeons , waiting for him to finish his drawing and talk to her , as she had done years and years ago . And still the suspense was there , the bubble of excitement in her throat when she knocked at the door , the sense of something imminent between them which might at any moment in all the years have resolved itself  --  and yet , she saw now , would never never do so . " What is Jacques doing ? " she asked suddenly . " Oh , I do n't know , " Paul answered indifferently , still absorbed in what he was doing . " He 's got a little shop of his own now and makes a good living mending old furniture and making an occa-1p209sional piece . He has become a satisfied paterfamilias  --  he has settled down . " His tone mocked the words as if nothing could be more stupid and fruitless than Jacques 's life . " We never see him any more . " And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point before laying it down , he added , " What made you ask ? " and sat down with a sigh opposite her , thinking , as he did so , We are getting old , my poor Louise ; for she did indeed look badly this morning . " I was wondering about Francoise . " Paul shrugged . " Oh , Francoise has forgotten all that . That 's ancient history . At her age six years is an eternity . " " And at our age ? " She smiled a little sadly . " A moment  --  an interminable moment , which is quite a different thing . We have n't changed  --  or hardly  --  but Francoise is a different person . " " What is she like ? I never see her any more . " Paul smoked for a moment in silence . He was thinking of how little he really knew of his eldest daughter . " She has succeeded admirably in divorcing herself from her family  --  she lives with us , but that is the most that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about her plans and her work , but as for what really goes on inside her  --  you know as much as I do . He smiled with a trace of bitterness . " She has made her escape . " " Is she happy ? " Louise asked innocently . " A perfectly irrelevant question  --  no one is happy at twenty-one  --  she 's fearfully ambitious . She is determined to be graduatedavec la plus grande distinction . ' I have an idea that she haswrapped her emotional life up in a sort of cocoon for the time being  --  but how do I know ? " he added . " She never brings any of her school friends home any more . All sorts of things may be going on . " " And that does n't worry you  --  and Madame ? " Louise could n't imagine Melanie not knowing what was happening to her children . Everyone spoke of the Duchesne family as the closest , the most intimately linked of any family they knew . It had often been discusseddownstairs  --  that and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " Paul said quietly , " you know it was a battle for years . But then Francoise won . After the business about Jacques she never confided in us again . She 's a strong character , stronger even than her mother , because she is more personally ambitious . And even Melanie finally understood that Francoise had won her independence , not by moving out , by going away  --  which I 'm sure she must have considered  --  but within the family . That is quite a triumph , eh ? " he ended , as if he enjoyed the triumph immensely himself . " You are generous , Paul . " " No , I 'm not generous . Not a bit . I should be fearfully jealous of any man Francoise loved . Which is , I suppose , why it 's a good thing that I am unaware of that not impossible he  --  if he exists . " And then he added as an afterthought , " Melanie is generous . " " Yes , she is . " On that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them inevitably think of themselves  --  Louise , especially , with her divided loyalty , could never hear the name without a sharp pain . And feeling the emotion in the silence , Paul was drawn in spite of himself to speak , to explore the wound , to put a new dressing on it . " It 's not been a very gay six years for you , my poor Louise , " he said gently . " I do n't know , " she said , looking at him steadily with her clear glance , " not gay perhaps . Not empty either . At least , " she added half humorously , " I have n't settled down . " Paul got up and began to pace the floor . He was irritated with himself for going on with this , irritated by his own lack of courage , with his holding on to her love , because in some way he needed it now . If she were not there , in that chair , for an hour or so every day , he would miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and that so negative , little more than this irritation , this rest/lessness  --  and then whatever went on in her imagination . Not answering her look or what she had said , he laughed suddenly . " Madness and craziness , " he said savagely . " But you know , Louise , you have somehow or other built yourself into my life . " Now that he had said it  --  so much more than he had ever been willing to admit until today  --  she realized suddenly that this was the last thing she wanted to hear . As long as she had been sure that nothing would happen , that she was locked safely into the impossible , she could enjoy these hours on which her life depended without guilt , without torment . The last three years had in some ways been the happiest , the richest of her life , just because she had stopped believing in the possibility of anything more . " Nonsense , " she said with surprising vehemence . " I wo n't hear of such a thing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said gravely , " it is true . " And then he went on , apparentlyirrelevantly , " You know , Louise , I am working again  --  at my own work . I have begun a new book . " " Paul , that is wonderful . That is good . " How many times he had told her that he would never write again , that it was perfectly pointless to try to express his ideas , to go through the fearful labor of condensation and clarification again , since there was no one to read what he wrote . And always she had believed , always said he would have to write again when he once more had something to say , and when the ideas were fully matured , they would demand to be expressed . " What did I tell you ? " " Yes . " He came over and took her hand in both of his and kissed it . " You believed in the impossible . I ca n't imagine why , but you did . " But she would not say again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cost , exploit this moment for more than what it held in itself . On this point she had in the last moments come to a final understanding with herself . " I love you . " The words were spoken before he was aware of what he was saying.  |p212Gently  she pulled her hand from him . " No , " she said quietly , " I have been useful . That is enough . " And for the first time in this strange conversation he looked at her , for herself and not for himself , in amazement . " What has happened to you , Louise ? " " I do n't know . " " You 've changed . Since we 've been here this morning  --  you 've changed . What is it ? " For a moment , as it is said a drowning man sees his whole life spread out before him , she saw her whole life spread out . But she was not drowning . She was coming into the fullness of her real self . She laughed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think it is possible that at my age one can suddenly grow up ? It sounds ridiculous , I guess . " But her voice betrayed that it was not ridiculousat all . This , then , was the harvest of those six years in which nothing at all had happened . It would take her a long time , many hours of solitude to explore fully the significance , the total gift of the last few minutes . But for the moment it was she who must dress the wound , not he . Because her wound was healed . " You have been a good friend to me , Paul , " she said at last . In spite of herself , it sounded like a farewell . Two weeks later theuniversity still had no word from Schmidt ; the absence of news had become a tangible part of Paul 's and Melanie 's life . It was the last thing they talked of before they went to sleep , and when Melanie got up at seven , in the dark , and wondered why she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By now he might be in hiding or  --  this she steadfastly refused to admit  --  already caught , trapped , and shut up in a concentration camp . Her thoughts turnedp213to his wife , whom they had never seen , of whom they knew nothing except that she had chosen to stay in Germany . Was she doing it only for the sake of her son , in the hope that he would change and eventually come back to her and then flee with her to join Gerhart ? Or was it a real divorce , a divorce in the mind ? Could she be a convinced Nazi ? In the early morning , at seven even , it was still quite dark ; the autumn rains had begun ; and Melanie had at times a feeling of claustrophobia , as if the immense darkness of Germany hung over them and would swallow them up . It was a relief when the dim gray dawn came and one by one the familiar trees and shrubs of her garden made their appearance and the natural day chased away the spooks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a permanent part of their lives . It was all very well to remind herself that the aftereffects of grippe were known to be fatigue and melancholy ; she could push them away violently by an effort of will and by keeping busy , but the fact remained , anxiety had taken up permanent residence in the bottom of the heart . The radio , Paul 's great source of relaxation , had now become a Cassandra they must live with every day , the loud repeated voice of terror , bringing bad news and the presence of evil into the house . Melanie wished sometimes that they did n't have a radio . Perhaps if they did not listen or hear the loud voice of the Nazi , they would be able better to keep in touch with the voice of Germany , the gentle heroic voice of Schmidt and all the others whose silent struggle , whose silent suffering Melanie felt she was listening to and trying to reach all day long . Paul talked now of going into Germany himself to find Schmidt . He would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting himself killed , which would be no help to anyone . So every morning Melanie hoped against hope that there might be some word . If the telephone rang at the office , her heart was in her mouth . Would n't Schmidt be able to get some message through somehow , soon ?  | The days of this autumn had become interminable . So it was a relief when their old friend Emile Poiret turned up one rainy day under a big black umbrella to ask them to help him  --  it was a relief because Emile 's trouble was a human and practical one that Melanie could help to solve . Here was something she could do . It was , of course , about Pierre . They had seen very little of Pierre in the last years . They knew that he was writing Flemish poems , had even published two small books , and that he had spent two months in Russia and come back an enthusiastic Communist . But the few times he had come out to the Duchesnes ' on a Sunday , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore cheap flashy suits  --  he threw his weight about a good deal . He had become , in fact , an intellectual snob , surrounded himself with an adoring group of young Flemish enthusiasts , and would take no criticism from anyone about either his life or his work . His articles on Russia had made quite a sensation in the Brussels Soir , and on the few thousand francs they brought in , he had set himself up in a hotel and made a fool of himself by taking prostitutesup to his room not for the usual purpose but to convert them to Communism , and because , incurably romantic , he had some idea of saving them from their sordid lives with his flaming and nebulous ideas . Most of this the Duchesnes had already heard  --  it was common gossip . Pierre had graduated with honors from the university in the field of comparative literature ( he had amazing facility with languages ) , and he was not one to hide his light under a bushel . Whatever he did , he was anxious to do publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had a little daughter ten years old as well as the grown-up boy  --  showed his contempt for them and their ideas openly , borrowed money from them whenever possible ; but they actually knew very little about his life . It had been a terrible shock to Emile and Suzanne when they were faced with debts amounting to three thousand francs , threep215or four months ' salary to Emile  --  a sum which it would be crushinglydifficult to pay . But it was not the money ; it was , as Emile said , not even the criminal tendencies this pointed to ; it was " the lack of heart . " It had come to him like a stroke of lightning that their son , their brilliant and adored son , did not love them . And he took this to be his own fault . He sat now in Paul 's studio  --  he had not even taken off his overcoat  --  with tears pouring unashamedly down his cheeks . Paul and Melanie looked at each other , exchanged one glance of completeunderstanding , and then Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of brandy for just such emergencies : " First of all , drink this ; it will make you feel better . " Emile made a wide gesture of despair , as if this were the final and worst misunderstanding . " But , Paul , you know very well I do not drink wine . " " This is medicine , " Paul answered firmly , and handed him a small glass , which Emile drank as if it were medicine , in one gulp , and then shook himself like a dog and blew his nose on an enormousblue handkerchief . " I feel it in my chest . " He beamed as he polished his glasses . " Secondly , " Paul said , taking out his wallet , " and before we considerthe serious aspects of the affair , here is three thousand francs . " And , as Emile made a gesture of protest , " It happens that we are rich today , enormously rich , because we have just been paid a hundred thousand francs by a skinflint factory owner  --  " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed for mortgageson the two houses and bills , but anyway , they had enough to give to Emile , and that was the main thing . Here Melanie inter-rupted : " And of course , Emile , this is a loan to Pierre . We shall expect him to pay it back himself , little by little . " " Now , " Paul said , sitting down opposite Emile , " now , my dear man , take off your coat and let 's talk about the thing that really matters  --  Pierre himself . "  |p216The  Duchesnes had always dazzled Emile . He looked at them in amazement . They acted with such speed and efficiency in any emergency that one hardly had time to realize what was happening . He looked from one to the other and shook his head . " You are good , so good , " he said gently . " I can not refuse . " " What does Pierre say to all this himself ? " " Oh "  --  Emile stammered slightly in his anxiety  --  " he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . He would be furious . " And once more Melanie and Paul exchanged a wordless communication . At that moment Pierre himself was walking in the park near the Palais Royal , trying to make up his mind whether he dared to go to Tante Melanie and make a clean breast of the whole business . He had gone back to his hotel room after breakfast to find that he was locked out for unpaid bills  --  and , far worse than that , that the manager had got into touch with his father , who must by now be on the way . The idea of meeting his father in the lobby of the hotel in front of the supercilious clerk was more than he could face , and he had simply run away , hatless , in a light raincoat . Here at least no one would look at him  --  for there was no one here . He walked aimlessly , looking down at the pebbly path and the sad crumpled leaves , and , as the violent emotion of the first half hour left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hair as the whole humiliation swept over him  --  how he had swaggered in and out of the hotel , been insolent to the clerk , and all because he wanted people to know he was someone important , Pierre Poiret the journalist , Pierre Poiret the Flemish poet  --  and all the time they had no doubt been snickering behind their hands , knowing it to be all false , false armor that he wore to hide his sense of inferiority . Now his father was probably already at the desk , weeping and wringing his hands and making humble apologies to the manager . At this Pierre ground his teeth . For the insane part of the whole business was that it had all happened through a petty miscalculation in hisp217accounts . He had simply made a mistake anyonc might make over a few thousand francs  --  careless , perhaps , but hardly criminal . It was crystal-clear that if he had been some bourgeois wine merchant the hotel would never have acted as they did . They would have reminded him gently that his bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been waiting for a chance to do so for weeks , ever since he started bringing Jeanne and Suzy and MarieAngeup to his room . They were putting him out because he was a Communist . When he had got to this point , Pierre began to feel better . So  --  he was really a martyr to the cause . In that case , he need not feel ashamed or humiliated . He lifted his head and looked critically at the great chestnuts all around him . Lines of poetry rushed to his lips : " In the day of my humiliation , I walked under the dying chestnuts , lonely . " He fished around in his pockets for a pencil and wrote the line down on an old envelope , shifted the position of " lonely , " and then buried the envelope in his pocket again like a squirrel with a nut . He felt elated  --  he would leave the country , get the Soir to send him to Czechoslovakia or Finland . His head buzzed with plans . In the end this might be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance he saw a small stout woman walking toward him fast : Tante Melanie ! In his state of excitement it seemed possible that she was looking for him , that she had come like conscience itself to find him and humiliate him in a far deeper way than the clerk at the hotel could do . The woman came nearer and nearer ; he found it impossible to run away . He walked steadily toward her until he saw that she was somebody entirely different  --  an old crone with too much make-up on and a squinting eye . He was astounded to realize that he was almost disappointed that it was not Tante Melanie . I hate them , he muttered to himself , I hate them . For the last few years all his efforts had one unadmitted purpose  --  to make the Duchesnes respect him and take him at his own evaluation of him- self . They must admit that he was a genius , an exception to all their rules . They must come to him and confess that they had been wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they called him selfish toward his parents , because he was serving a great destiny . When his first book came out and Paul wrote him a long detailed letter of criticism he had been furious . What does he know about what I am trying to do ? he had shouted to a group of his admirers . What does he know about poetry ? And he had never answered the letter , though for some reason he had carried it in his wallet ever since and reread it often . Ever since he had been a small boy his attitude to the Duchesnes had been ambivalent . On the one hand , the house in the country was his promised land , the one place he could remember where he had ever felt at home . On the other hand , it was the scene of his humiliation  --  for always , and quite without intending to , the Duchesnes had made him feel inferior . They had taught him manners , and that in itself , meant so kindly , was a fearful humiliation . They criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all for his own good , but he was not their own child , so the criticism seemed barbed and rankled afterward . He had determined never to see them again until he could see them on his own terms , but now he was so filled with tenderness when he thought of Tante Melanie that there were tears in his eyes and he was on the point of running to her the moment the least thing went wrong . He felt cold and terribly lonely and thought with distaste of the few places where he could go , the disorderly dirty apartments of student friends , or home . Home , he thought bitterly , to face his father 's gentle forgiving gaze ? His mother 's tears and protestations ? It would be better to ship out as a common seaman on a freighter for Brazil . The terrible thing was that this one little slip , this mathematical error , would now stand up and seem to prove that there was something wrong about his whole life . The injustice of it ! The mean/ness of human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes were locked up , his typewriter , his books and papers  --  without three thousand francs his hands were tied . The only people he could imagine having that sum on hand were the Duchesnes . " I ca n't , I ca n't , " he muttered aloud , clenching his teeth . And then he had an inspiration . He would ask Dupierreux to send him to Spain  --  true , no one yet had sensed the significance of the war in Spain . They still talked about it as if it were a local affair . It was a tremendous chance for a reporter . He would come back covered with glory . But when Pierre got to the office of the Soir , he was told that Dupierreux was in conference and could see no one until tomorrow . The girl at the telephone desk looked him up and down , and he realized suddenly that he must look like a wild man , with the water running down from his hair , his collar soaked . With her uninterested glance his whole plan collapsed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile sweetly and tell him that they were of course sending seasoned reporters to the front . A mere student with three articles on Russia to his credit could not be considered . Pierre was glad to be out on the street again , where at least he was invisible , where no one would look at him appraisinglyand inevitably read his distress . He looked at his watch . It was half-past eleven . If he hurried he could be at the Maison Bernard before the gathering at lunch time . Now he had made his decision , he did not think of what he would say when he arrived . He thought of nothing except that now he was on his way to the one place in the world where he wanted to be . Panting  --  he had run the last four blocks  --  sweating , drenched , he burst into the studio upstairs and found the last person he had expected  --  his father . Before Emile got up , before anyone could accuse , forgive , demand , do any of the things Pierre had imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him on both cheeks.  | " You 're soaked , " she said severely . " Come along to the bathroom  --  takeoff your coat and hang it where it wo n't ruin the furniture . Where have you been ? " She had meant to be angry , but now that she saw him she could n't be anything at first except glad to see him  --  and her question meant really , " Where have you been all these years ? We 've missed you . " " You see "  --  Emile turned to Paul warmly  --  " you see , we all turn to you as soon as we are in trouble . " " Yes , yes , " Paul sighed , and then added mischievously , " but in that case it would be nice if you came to see us a little more often when you are not in trouble  --  eh ? It 's awful how we never see each other any more , Emile . " Melanie was looking at Pierre critically  --  he had grown much thinner , let his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a caricature of a poet . But his wide-apart clear blue eyes had not changed , nor the sullen expression in the eyebrows , drawn close togetherand quite heavy . And Pierre , who was stripped now of every hope of playing a part , since his father had told them the whole story , let himself be propelled back into the studio without a word . " Hello , Father , " he said with a sheepish smile , and sat down heavily in the nearest chair . " The Duchesnes have generously given me three thousand francs to pay your hotel bill , " Emile began clumsily . " Oh . " Pierre was not surprised , nor even , it seemed , particularly grateful . " You might at least thank them , " Emile said gently . " Thank you very much , " Pierre answered , like a child repeating a lesson . " Our lion is as meek as a lamb , " Paul teased . " Not a growl , not a roar , Pierrot ? Why , we had heard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byron at very least  --  and now you are cast down for a tiny little debt ? Come , come  --  " But Melanie saw that the boy was close to tears.  | " No , Paul , do n't tease him . Look , I suggest that we talk about all this later . It 's nearly lunch time . You 'll stay to lunch , Emile , of course ? " Pierre 's last hope vanished as his father accepted the invitation . " You will want to talk , " Melanie added , and took them into the little study-bedroom next to the studio , where Paul sometimes slept when he stayed in town . " There , my children , make yourselves comfortable ; we 'll call you in half an hour . " The door closed behind her . Pierre was alone with his father . The room was like a prison cell . There was nothing to sit on but the bed  --  the single window opened onto a court and was , for some reason , barred . Emile sat down . Pierre went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . Let him begin . But Emile was silent . He knew that it was a terrible thing for the boy to find him just here just now  --  that it must seem a betrayal  --  for the Duchesnes had been his people , his friends always  --  and one reason Emile had seen little of them was not to trespass on this center of his son 's life . In his innocence , Emile could wait , forever if necessary . But Pierre , in his guilt , turned after a moment and said with an aggressiveintonation : " Well ? Are n't you going to say anything ? " Before the naked hatred in the boy 's eyes , Emile dropped his own . " Pierre , " he asked in a perfectly detached voice , as if it were a scientific question , " why do you hate us so much ? " This was the last question Pierre had expected , penetrating as it did with frightful honesty to the very core of his confusion . It took from him his only arm . He blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask me that ? " Emile was sitting forward with his hands clasped between his knees , a familiar gesture , one which had always irritated Pierre , for it was exactly the position of a workman on the trolley cars . " Because , " he went on with the same quiet voice , " I never understoodyou before . I never understood this fact in your life  --  that youp222have always hated and despised us . It 's a tragic fact , Pierre . And I blame myself that I have refused to recognize it until now . " The man is so terribly good , Pierre said to himself . Why then had this goodness always irritated him ? " Why do you hate us , Pierre ? " he asked again There was going to have to be an answer . Downstairs Pierre could hear Melanie 's voice and then Mlle. Zumpt laughing . Outside , just outside the door , was the whole normal world , but here he was caught in sickness and death . " You are an intelligent boy , " Emile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his manner . The tears , the gentle suffering which always set Pierre on edge , seemed to have vanished . " You must have thought about this a great deal in all these years . I think you will have to try to answer me , Pierre . " Pierre turned his back on his father and stared at the window . If he answered now , he would be tearing up the very root of his life , his pride . The long war with his father would be over and his father would have won . But he knew very well that he would never have the patience to be silent . His father 's own interminable patience had come to an end , and the silence now was an absolute vacuum , a suspense which no one could sustain forever , certainly not he . Some violence , some rush of emotion would have to fill it . Pierre felt as if the tension in his head would burst it open . And Emile waited . When Pierre spoke , he spoke to the barred window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me do things that I did n't believe in . " " I never forced you to do anything . " Now Pierre turned savagely on him . " No , that 's just it . You sat there and looked at me until I wanted to kill you . Why did n't you force me ? Why did n't you ? " he said hysterically . Emile smiled one of his rare illuminating smiles . " My poor child . "   " Do n't pity me , " Pierre answered furiously . " Do n't you see ? It 's a way of life I do n't believe in . I do n't believe in your saintly compassion . I believe in violence . I believe in revolution . I hate your church and your Christ ! " He felt as though he were shrieking . " And what else ? " Emile asked , as if it were the most natural thing in the world for a young man to deny God , as if it had hardly shocked him . " I felt that home was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be swallowed up , destroyed . It was I or you , do n't you see ? " For a moment Emile was silent , as if he were weighing evidence quietly , and then he-said , " Sit down ; Pierre . Sit down , " he said again , and Pierre sat down with his head in his hands , abjectly . He was beginning to see for the first time that under his gentleness his father was strong , deeply strong , and in his heart he was glad . " This is my failure , Pierre , not yours . And it is for me now to beg your pardon . " " No . " " You were always brilliant , and I was always afraid that this brilliance would lead you away from the human things . I did not impose my will on you  --  no , I did worse than that . I tried to be your conscience . You are right . I made your home a prison . " Here Emile knocked his forehead with his closed fist in a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " I have been stupid . " Pierre put his head in his hands and wept convulsively . What a waste the years behind him seemed , an interminable waste he had dragged along after him , a waste of pride , a waste of hatred  --  since it was ending now in this abject state , in his weeping in his father 's presence . Emile had not moved . He sat still with his hands clasped between his knees . At this moment of failure he had communicated with his son for the first time in years . His words had actually penetrated , moved the boy . Here , when he had been wholly cast down , he was mysteriously lifted up by the Divine Compassion . He hadP224come to understanding . The inexhaustible miracle of life filled him with joy . But although Pierre had been for a moment touched by his father , a moment of illumination ( which he thought of as weakness the next day ) does not change a life . At first he sank back gratefullyinto being once more a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking him back to the country with them for an indefinite stay . He was to take his time . He was to work at the novel he had begun and have the long quiet autumn days to himself in the empty house  --  and in return he was to help in the garden . In these days what struck him most was how little anything had changed here . Every morning he got up in the dark , went down to the kitchen to get a pot of hot water to shave with , dressed , and threw his bedclothes together in a semblance of order . There was the ritual of breakfast , the noisy ritual of the family 's departurefor town , and then silence and solitude . From his window over the garage he looked out on the black earth and frozen cabbagesof the potager , covered with frost in the morning so they gleamed moon-like in the dark . He sat for hours watching the poplartrees tremble and sway and the leaves fall one by one . Everythingin the house was as he had remembered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast room , the melancholy portrait of Paul as a boy , the Sunday smell of the salon , the familiar book of French nursery songs open on the piano , the dark green linoleum in the front hall , so cold underfoot  --  and the gay sunny veranda where Francoise painted at her high table . Nothing had changed . It was all just as he had remembered it a thousand times , on a slow train in Russia , in his dingy hotel room , and on his long walks by himself through Brussels . And more important than the things themselves , the atmosphere of the house was exactly the same  --  the enormous amount of life going on , the violent argu-P225ments , the scenes of reconciliation afterward , the precious warmth of the evening " good nights " on the stairs . He had come home . He was so happy that tears filled his eyes a dozen times a day . He had no desire to see any of his old friends in town . His life for the past two years seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed a long tender letter to his father and mother , asking their forgiveness and promising to think deeply about the future and to- try to be worthy of their trust . And having mailed it , he forgot all about them too , as if nothing whatever existed except the Duchesnes and the house and the garden . But after the first days he began to be aware that there were changes , that there was a difference after all , that it was no longer quite the same . Was it that he had forgotten how hard everyone worked here ? Of course in the old days there had been Bo-Bo and Louise and Marie , and , in the garden , Croll . Now there was no one , but  --  no , it was not only that . In his hours of hating the Duchesnes he had often reminded himself of how enclosed they were in their own corner of the world and accused them of intolerablesmugness . Their Olympian attitude , he had told himself a hundred times , was only a kind of escapism . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the world around her was none of her concern , still refused to be drawn into political arguments , still scorned his offers to inform her . But of course for him the heart of this house and the reason for his rooted attachment to the family was Tante Melanie . And it was in her that he began to notice the change . She still rallied herselfand everyone around her to the daily tasks as if each day were a battle into which one plunged with zest . She still loved to sit at the table after supper and talk endlessly of everything under the sun , from gardening to Dostoevski and from Fascism to Picasso . He had never surprised her in a moment of lassitude or doubt . And yet there was a difference . Six years ago she could not have possibly kept herself from taking a high moral attitude toward his own escapades , for instance . ButP226to his enormous surprise and uneasiness , no one had scolded him or insisted on " a heart-to-heart " talk ; they seemed simply as happy to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Uncle Paul , of course , teased hint incessantly about his debts , about his poems , about his political stand , and about his insistence that he would go to prison rather than serve a year in the army . But that was very different from the inquisition he had expected and steeled himself to meet . When after a week nothing at all had been said , he began to wish to explain himself , all unasked . He realized with a flash of self-knowledge that disturbed him , that he had been fighting a war all these years with something in the Duchesnes which no longer existed . At my age , he said to himself , I take absolutely for granted that in six years I shall be a differentperson . But it never occurs to me that a grownup will change . One expected grownups to be one thing and not another , to have been finally molded into the shape in which they would die . It was quite a shock to Pierre to find this was not so . They do respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept me as I am , without humiliating me . The fact filled him with shame . He saw himself now as unbearably crude and narrow . And the person he chose to confide in was Colette , Colette who had shared the secret of writing poetry with him when they were both children , Colette who was now unlike any girl he had ever seen , in that she seemed absolutely untouched sexually and years older than her age in understanding . She puzzled him and he was very curious about her . But it was hard to get her alone  --  when she came back from school she was always doing lessons or running out to the garden . And when he followed her out , she seemed strangely impersonal , telling him what to do to help but not particularly interested in what he had to say . Once he asked her if she wrote poems still and she answered " No " with such finality that he did n't dare pursue the matter any further . Once he asked her if she were in love and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course not , " as if she had more serious things than that to worry about . P227Finally one warm Sunday afternoon he persuaded her to come for a walk  --  " Just to the end of the road where we can see the fields . " " They walked quickly , as if they were on an errand and had little time . " Do you think I 've changed much , Colette ? " he asked after a moment , because this seemed as good as any other way to begin . " I do n't know . I have n't thought about it . " She gave him a mischievous sidelong look . " You 're much thinner . " " You 've changed , " he said insistently . " I expect so , " but she would not give him an inch . " Why do you treat me like this , Colette ? " he asked in exasperation . " After all , we 're old friends  --  we used to have fine talks . Do n't you remember ? " She kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in following it up and kicking it on another few yards . They had used to play this game for hours , and for once Pierre moved quickly and got ahead of her . " Pay attention , " he went on angrily as he kicked it a good ten yards . " I am paying attention , " she answered , running ahead . She was laughing at him quite gaily , and as he caught up with her he pulled her arm through his and adjusted his step to hers . " There ; that 's better . " What did she think of him really ? He wanted to know that suddenly more than anything else in the world . " Is it ? " " More friendly . Now we can talk , " he said happily . She had not drawn her arm away . " I do n't want to talk . " " You 're a funny girl . " For some reason they stopped in the middle of the road and stood there , silently , warily , facing each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I think you 're awful . "   " Why ? " he grinned back . " Well "  --  she walked on alone , frowning thoughtfully  --  " as far as I can see , Pierre , you 're completely selfish . That 's one thing . " " Have you read my poems ? " " I do n't see what that has to do with it . " " It has everything to do with it , " he shouted angrily . " Do n't you see ? " " No , " she answered with another sidelong look . It occurred to him that she was simply teasing him and none of this was serious . " As a matter of fact , I have read your poems . Most of them seem to me rather loose and romantic and very much like you , " but now she blushed because she felt she had gone too far , farther than she meant , seeing him collapse before her eyes so visibly as if she had put a pin into a balloon . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what I think , " she said , suddenly skipping like a little girl and picking up a crimson maple leaf from the black road . All Pierre 's old anger and frustration filled him again . What made these people so damnably sure of themselves ? Only because they did n't know anything of the world ; had no idea what the real conflicts were ; did n't realize that the banks of Belgium controlledits politics and , for one step forward , forced the legislature one step back ; knew nothing of Russia , of Spain , of anything but their private lives and their absurd old-fashioned ethical standards which drove them to try to be useful without ever going to the root of the matter , to work in clinics or against child delinquency without ever examining the political framework behind them . He walked on ahead with his head bent , his hands shoved into his pockets , raging . " You think that because I 'm trying to say things in my poems that will reach the masses , things that have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted back at her . She ran to catch up with him . " Besides , " he went on more quietly , " all you 're doing is repeating what you 've heard your father say . "   " Perhaps I am , but I think my father is a very wise man . Do n't you ? " she asked directly . " He has all the faults of the pure intellectual , " he said pompously . " Namely ? " " First of all , complete detachment . He does n't know what is going on . He lives in an ivory tower . " Colette was frowning now  --  always these same questions came up wherever one turned . It was awful . " But , Pierre , " she asked seriously , now they were really talking , " if you believe that nothing is possible without the revolution , I should think you would work for that , really work , not by writing poems , but through the unions , or whatever one does  --  by going directly into politics --  " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , so I try to put my writing at the service of the revolution . " At last he was given a chance to explain himself , and Pierre was wildly happy . He sniffed the air . He looked around at the small closed chateau they were passing . " I bet you do n't know who lives there . " " No , I do n't . " " You see , " he said in triumph , " you do n't even know your own neighbors . " " Summer people , " Colette said with perfect contempt . " We know the people in the village . " " Touche , " he admitted . " No "  --  this is what he had wanted to talk about all along  --  " I ca n't define your family really . Your father and mother are the best people I know . I love them more than my own parents . " " Well , then , " Colette asked gently , " what 's wrong ? Why do you always fight us ? " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of despair and giving in  --  " because if I did n't I would have to change my life , everything I believe in , begin again from the beginning --  " " I do n't see that . Why does everyone have to be alike , do the " Why ? " he grinned back . " Well "  --  she walked on alone , frowning thoughtfully  --  " as far as I can see , Pierre , you 're completely selfish . That 's one thing . " " Have you read my poems ? " " I do n't see what that has to do with it . " " It has everything to do with it , " he shouted angrily . " Do n't you see ?

All Pierre 's old anger and frustration filled him again . What made these people so damnably sure of themselves ?

He looked around at the small closed chateau they were passing . " I bet you do n't know who lives there . " " No , I do n't .

" " Because "  --  he threw up his hands in a gesture of despair and giving in  --  " because if I did n't I would have to change my life , everything I believe in , begin again from the beginning --  " I do n't see that . Why does everyone have to be alike , do thep230same things , believe the same things in the same way ? That 's Nazism . Why ca n't we be ourselves and you be yourself ? Why do you take our mere existence as an attack on yourself , Pierre ? It 's so strange , " she said passionately . " Because , " he exploded , " do n't you see , when I 'm with you I do n't believe in myself any more . " Colette saw suddenly what anguish and self-torture there had always been behind his boastfulness , and she remembered the fight in the woods , the horror and shame of it  --  it came back vividly , and she understood that they had been cruel to Pierre that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had despised him because he was beaten  --  whereas instead he had shown the purest kind ofcourage , the courage of the weak in the face of the strong , the extreme courage of the coward who makes himself brave by an act of will . " We 're a horribly critical family , " she admitted , slipping her arm through his . " Oh , Colette , " he murmured in an agony of self-pity , " I 've been so lonely always . " But what he did n't tell her , what he had n't quite the courage to confess , was , " I 've been so wrong all these years . " They were coming to the end of the avenue , where the rough pavestones gave way to a dirt road , where a last avenue of maples ended in open fields . On one side stood a white summer villa , the windows boarded up for the winter , and on the other , black plowed hills , rolling off gently one after another to a wide , faroffhorizon . Here Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . " How I love this country . I love it passionately , " Pierre said after a moment . " Oh , Colette , I want to be useful . " But she did n't hear him . She was sniffing the wind like a colt , her eyes shining . " Be quiet , Pierre ; the larks are singing . " Each was lost in himself , lifted up in an ecstasy of wind and sunP231and space . " I want to be useful . " Never had Pierre said those exact words before . He was amazed at himself . " You 're a family of magicians , Colette  --  you are dangerous people . One is not safe within a mile of any of you , " he broke out as they turned back to houses and people , to the crowded trees and dark- . ness of the avenue . And Colette laughed , though she had no idea what he meant ' It was strange , Paulthought , sitting at his desk on a Sunday morning not long after Pierre had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world drove them all inward rather than outward . This autumn seemed above all a season of evaluation and self-questioning , in which each in his own way set his personal life against the huge pattern of terror  --  even Pierre . Outside , it was a still , sunlit morning , gentle and radiant after the long cold weeks of rain . The cat stretched herself out on the window sill , her two front paws laid meekly on either side of her tummy while she licked it passionately , lying flat on her back in a most abandoned position . Fifi was far more attached to Paul than Filibert had ever been and so , perversely , he was far less interested in her . He tolerated her presence , he teased her mercilessly , and he pretended not to be flattered when she wound herself round his legs purring loudly . " Cat , " he said to her severely , " you distract me . You make it quite impossible for me to concentrate on anything but the superior quality of the fur on your stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ austeres '  --  you are a little devil . " But still he watched her and sighed , " Yes , yes . " The truth was , he had found it impossible to do any real work since Schmidt 's letter . It created an inward suspense , as if he were hung up in the air in a vacuum . Now Francis was pulling wires to try to find out if Schmidt were still in Berlin , and Melanie had written to his wife , a perfectly normal letter telling the family news and asking for news of them . They should have an answer to this in a day or so . Something must give them an inkling soon of what had happened and what might be done . " Yes , yes , " Paul murmured again , picking up a sheaf of papers , glancing at them absent-mindedly , and then laying them down again . With the future so uncertain , the past had become extraordinarilyvivid . He found himself looking back to his student days more and more , turning backward as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been young in a way his own children  --  even Solangc , with her funny little air of responsibility as she went out to take care of her animals  --  had never been . They had had no chance to be extravagant , to have their favorite books bound in expensive special bindings ( he remembered the bindery where he had spent hours as a young man , choosing a fine leather and examining the hundreds of designs , the smell of morocco , the delicious cool parchments ) , to go for week ends to Paris or to London . His family had never been really rich , and yet , as he looked back , his student days seemed to him extravagantly free and rich by comparison with Colette 's for instance . Much more had been asked of her at an early age . Was this a loss ? Or a gain ? It would take another ten years to begin to know , and by then they would be plunged into ' the utter dislocation , anguish , and terror of another war . Because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest self now . And because of this , time had assumed a false importance . There was no time . A child like Colette actually weighed whether she ought to spend a summer in England  --  it seemed fantastic  --  at sixteen ! Fifi , having licked her fur into flat wet decency , now stretched , sighed , and closed her eyes . " Cat , " Paul said to her , though she was not listening , " you areP233emancipated from the past and from the future  --  emancipated from time , lucky creature . You live in the eternal present of the true mystic . " For must one not try to be at every instant the whole of what one would choose to be for eternity ? To fail now , to be less than the utmost possible , was perhaps to fail for all eternity . And if I should die tomorrow , Paul asked himself , what should I leave behind me ? Three dead books , three living children , and somewhere in the deepest part of me a sense of utter failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all I have done all my life is to ask questions , to push one step further down a long black tunnel with the hope , with the desperate conviction that there must be a light at the end . But what if there were not ? Could one live and die in darkness ? Emile did not . Melanie did not . Far away from him , as far as if he breathed a different air , they moved in light . They lived by faith . In other words , they are sane , and I , he said to himself , am insane ; driven by a demon ; longing above all for love and for true brotherhood , and shutting out even my old friends like Francis , like Emile , because I pretend to see and to know more than they do about things which after all one can only feel , not seize with the intellect . In the last years he had been increasingly lonely , depending almost entirely on Louise for companionship , but when he did have an afternoon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was relieved to be alone again . They did not really know what he was talking about , and as a result , in an effort to explain himself , he talked too much , and badly . In writing , in setting his ideas down with the utmost precision , so they might have the abstract beauty of a geometrical figure , he had only been doing what the poet does when he takes the infinite pains to express his admiration of his lady 's eyes in a sonnet . It came back to him vividly how in 1919 , in his first book , he had had the sensation of writing a letter to Schmidt , a letter that could n't be written until the means of communication were open and the barriers of the war down . And everything he had ever written had perhaps been written in a desperate desire to communicate what he always failed to communicate through living itself . They had been a long apologia for his failure toward Melanie , toward the children , toward Emile , Francis , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you startled me ! " He turned to see Melanie standing in the door . " I 'm interrupting . " " No , no , " he said , looking at her as an explorer who has spent a year under the glare of snow and sun might look at a green tree . " Come in . I 've only been asking myself all the old questions that have no answers  --  and talking to Fifi , " he added with a smile which said better than any words that he was truly glad to see her . For even after all these years she never approached him with any feeling of certainty , always with the same inner trembling that it would be the wrong time or that , for some unknown reason , she would not please him . She gave a shy little laugh and confessed , " I felt lonely . I do n't know why . " " What a strange autumn it is , " he said as she sat down in the comfortable armchair . " Here we have been living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly it seems as if a crisis were at hand . I ca n't work . " He shrugged . " Even the children feel it . Colette looks as if she sat up half the night thinking . You , my dear , say you feel lonely ; Pierre turns up in a mess , expecting us to be able to solve his problems for him  --  heaven knows why . What is it in the air ? " he asked meditatively . " I have a funny feeling , " she answered , and he was struck with the parallel to his own thinking , " that everything is getting sifted down to its essence . I feel myself changing . It 's peaceful here , Paul . " She looked at the neat desk , the rows of books , the broad beam of sunlight crossing the room with motes of dust dancing in it . " I wish we could sell the business , " she said suddenly and violently . " Why not ? "   " Well "  --  Melanie frowned  --  " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to design on her own , give her a start . Then , " she added as if she were a little ashamed , " I think of our people , the two demoiselles , how would they live ? And the Jeans ? And M. Plante ? Things are not going to be easy for anyone now . Paul , I just ca n't see turning them out . " " It 's Schmidt 's letter , is n't it , Melanie ? It 's that  --  the shock , the cr , iL  --  ;  --  Arange " I do n't think it 's strange at all , " Melanie answered indignantly . In a second she was her old self , matter-of-fact , forthright . " After all , it 's a sign that there is no hope for Germany  --  at least the good Germans are once more not going to have a chance . We know now that there will be war . " " I told you there would be war ten years ago . I 've always known it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact that pierces us where we live . It 's different . It 's no longer an exercise in political dialectic . It 's what we 're going to have to live , Paul . Oh , do n't you see the difference ? Why does n't Schmidt let us know what to do ? " she interrupted herself impatiently . " We 're none of us very good at living in suspense , are we ? And yet that will be our element from now on . " " There 's never been any real security  --  not since before the last war  --  but there 's always been hope , I suppose that 's it . Now "  --  she laughed at the image as she thought of it  --  " we 're rather like Noah before the flood . We have to think of something to do . " " There 's nothing to do . " " Oh , Paul "  --  she got up and went to the window , looking down on the little orchard , on the white table and chairs under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paths laid out at her feet  --  " how can you say that ? " ( She , for one , must see to it that they got a hive of bees ; and how the apples needed pruning ! ) " There 's your work . That has to be done . Those are the things that count , that really matter now . That 's what I meant about the business  --  it does n't seem to matter . " She came and put one hand on his shoulder , tenderly . " I suppose that 's why I felt lonely  --  for a long time it 's been little more than a means of keeping us going financially . I never could imagine doing something I did n't believe in . " She was like a tree that has suddenly lost all its leaves in a blast of hurricane wind . The hopes , the faith of twenty years , lay strewn around her . Paul took her hand in his and warmed it as if she were cold . " That 's what you meant about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and put an arm around her , so they were both leaning against the desk looking out . " I suppose so . " She let her head rest on his shoulder . Here was rest , love , peace  --  here and nowhere else in the world . For a moment she let herself rest in it . " And the beginning ? " " Oh , do n't ask . " She turned from him to hide the rush of tears . " I do n't know . There 's no giving up the business , Paul . It will have to go on for another five years or so . " Everything would go on as before : outwardly there would be no change in their lives . Only inside the frame they would have to change , grow , build new faith to meet the new and terrible future . How did one do that ? " But your book , darling . " She looked him full in the face , not hiding her tears now . " That 's what is good , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe so much in what you are trying to do , Paul . In the last weeks I think I have come to understand it as I never did before  --  I have sometimes not understood , I know . Partly because quite literally I could n't follow you , but more because ... " Here she hesitated , and Paul interrupted : " Because you wondered if the critics were right and I had been pursuing a chimera of my own all these years . " " No . " Again she frowned the characteristic frown which all the children had inherited , as if thinking for her and for them were a physical as well as a mental process . " No  --  I ca n't say it , " she ended , smiling . " I do n't quite know myself . Is n't it true , Paul ,  |p237that  we have missed a great deal of each other all these years ? Can we ever catch up ? " Standing before her , he took her face in his hands , exploring it with his fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small stubborn nose and the beautiful sad mouth ; delicately he traced it with his fingers and then he said : " I 've missed you , Melanie . I 've missed you . " All these years their beds had touched each other in the night ; they had slept side by side ; they had lived side by side ; they had loved each other deeply and silently . And yet there had been a sense of parting , a profound loneliness , as if there were some **27;1345;TOOLONG . Could it be dispelled now , literally like a mist burned off by the sun ? " I have n't loved you enough , " he went on , kissing her hungrily and lightly wherever his fingers had touched her face . " We 're middle-aged , Paul  --  and I feel so young , it 's absurd . " She drew away from him to look at him and she was blushing deeply . " Nobody knows a damn thing about love until they 're middleaged . That 's one thing I 'm sure of . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family . Heavens , it 's nearly one ! " And as she left him Paul sat down at his desk , trembling with eagerness to go on with his work . It takes a long time , all one 's life , to learn to love one person well  --  with enough distance , with enough humility , he thought  --  and he was flooded with happiness , thinking of the years ahead . It was true , as Paultold Louise , Francoise had forgotten Jacques  --  or , if she had not forgotten him , he meant the final shame of childhood , the last time she would ever expose herself to grownups , the last time she would give herself away . When , standing at her high drawing table in the drafting room at the art school , she sometimes remembered the wedding and what had happened afterward , she bit her lip and worked with a ferocity of concentration which the other students noticed . One made the experiment of teasing her ; a curly-headed handsome boy put an arm around her and said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mood . Francoise is thinking of someone . " Francoise turned like a flash and slapped his face . It was a savage , hard slap ; the laughter which greeted it was both astonished and admiring . After that they left her alone when she was moody . She had soon learned what that wink of Jacques at the wedding implied . It was not the dear and secret comradeship , the silent understanding she had believed it to mean . It was something quite different , shameful , wrong . For the next time they had met , when she was sent to M. Plante 's on an errand , Jacques had kissed her full on the mouth . She had never been kissed before , and this strange tongue forcing itself into her mouth filled her with horror and revulsion . Nothing of the fire and ecstasy of that one moment by the chest weeks before was in his kiss . It seemed to her filthy , and afterward she had wiped her mouth over and over again , as if she would never get the taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed her profoundly , as if a delicate equilibrium inside her had been smashed . It had made her dizzy with fear , and she had decided there and then that she would never let another man come anywhere near her . The boys at the school sensed this fierce guarded quality in her at once and left her alone . She never did belong in any of the gangs which set themselves up , fought among themselves , gathered in the park near the school at the lunch hour , and had their private jokes . Her friends were a gentle Argentinian Jew who adored her silently and would never dare to tell her so , and a tough angry Flemish girl from the Lower City in Brussels , whom Francoiseitp239respected because she was talented and because she laughed at the boys . With these two Francoise relaxed and enjoyed herself , but she never asked them to come home . They were part of her life at the school , but neither was part of her real life . Once Antonio had taken her to a concert , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afterward preferred to go alone . Music had become her one real passion . She spent all her pocket money on records and concerts  --  listening to music , she felt released from all the tensions . She became fully herself . One night as she got off the trolley and entered the pitch-dark of the avenue she had had an impulse to turn back . It was always an ordeal , the final quarter mile in the dark . Every time a leaf rustled , her heart jumped . Often she stopped and stood still , transfixed with terror , only to run wildly , her heart in her mouth , until at last she could click the gate behind her  --  safe . But her freedom to come home late at night alone was worth the terror . That was what she told herself on the particular night when she had for some reason wanted to turn back . And then , when she was only a hundred yards from home , a hand had suddenly been put across her mouth and she was grasped fiercely across one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted blood on her mouth , tore herself loose and ran blindly , weeping with terror , hearing a guttural drunken curse behind her . Her clothes were drenched with sweat when she finally got to her room and turned on the light . She lay on her bed , cold to the marrow and without the strength to undress . Later she rinsed her mouth over and over and still it tasted of blood . But she did not tell her family what had happened . The next time she went to a concert she took an umbrella with her . In the fierce determination to keep her freedom , to keep her inner life intact , she found the courage to face the terror alone . It was a tremendous victory , and when she thought of it she felt elated  --  at least in the daytime . At night the smell of the man who had seized her haunted her  --  she would turn on the light fifty timesP240during the night , imagining that he had somehow got into the room . The only thing she shared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had finished a design for furnishing a child 's nursery , for an exhibition room in an art gallery , for a workman 's recreation hall , she always brought it home to be criticizedand talked over . She trusted her mother 's judgment more than that of any of her teachers  --  and Melanie was not slow to criticize the academic point of view at the school . But there was one ambition she had not discussed with her parents , and that was her ambition to be a stage designer . She had not told Paul and Melanie that there was to be a contest for designs for Peer Gynt at the school  --  and she did not bring her ideas and plans home . The anxiety about Schmidt and the talk of war had touched her very little . She worked late every evening at the school and fell into bed when she got back . Her terrors , her dreams were all her own . Maurice , the quixotic , extravagant Maurice of the Brussels Theater , was to be the judge , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winner a chance to do a production for him at the theater . The competitive spirit , always strong at the school , ran high . Francoise had helped hang the exhibit of drawings , winnowed down now to ten , of which Maurice would choose the three best . Hers had not been among the first choices of the judges from the school , but among the last . She herself looked at her designs , now they were up , with a feeling of despair . They were so bare and understated compared to the others . She had been praised for her ingenuity in using four set pieces which could be shifted around for all the outdoor scenes , but she had felt disappointed to be praised for mechanical rather than imaginative reasons . Beside the Argentineboy 's rich colors and fantastic baroque sets , they looked queerly bare and undramatic . Of course the lighting would have to do everything  --  Mauricewould know that . It was one of his pet theories that people were lighting modern sets with the most old-fashioned andP241unimaginative techniques . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm : " You 've got to suggest , rather than state . The motion picture , the film can state more completely than any theatrical set  --  but it can not suggest . That is for us , " he had said last time he was at the house in the country , and Francoise had listened , rapt . Now today , for the first time , he would see her work and judge it . Francoise dressed in clean clothes from top to toe , as if she were going to be examined by a doctor ; she put on her best gray suit , a suit she had had made two years before with her first real money ; she ironed her one ruffled blouse , a Christmas present from Paul 's brother in the lingerie business ; she brushed and brushed her straight dark hair until it shone and then braided it over her head . She wore no make-up , but her eyes shone and her cheeks were pink with excitement . The family viewed these preparations with amusement and curiosity . Solange and Colette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Oh , it 's nothing , some sort of reception at the school . " But Francoise had a fine contempt for all social occasions and would have worn her oldest clothes on purpose if it were only that . Solange and Colette winked at each other and determined to find out somehow . And Paul surveyed her with a smile and added his observations : " Your Argentinian must be making headway after all . " " Nonsense , he 's nothing but a boy , " she answered without selfconsciousness . But Melanie held her at arm 's length and kissed her and said simply , " Well , whatever the secret is , you look beautiful , my darling , and we wish you luck . " She kissed her on both cheeks . " It 's terribly important ! " Francoise called back as she made her escape . In the course of the afternoon they forgot all about Francoise because everyone was waiting anxiously for the postman . Surely there would be an afternoon mail  --  surely there would be a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green gate for hours watching for the dark blue cap and big bag to appear around the corner , listening for the horn in the distance  --  would he never come ? Had he just given up the avenue for the afternoon ? " He 'll never come if you watch for him , " Colette called from the shed where she was chopping kindling . In a corner of the big studio where the designs were hung , Francoise giggled with Antonio out of sheer nervousness . They had some joke which would not have seemed funny at all at any other time but now convulsed them both . The room was full of people , talking loudly and self-consciously and keeping an eye on the door . But unlike the postman , who seemed to have no sense of responsibility , Maurice strode in exactly on time , his vermilion tie , his crest of black hair , his baggy English tweeds making an amusing contrast to the director of the school , correct in his pin-striped trousers and afternoon coat . " He looks like a funeral-parlor director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put a handkerchief in her mouth to keep back a shout of laughter . As Maurice stopped before each set of drawings and model , the student who had made them was introduced and given the chance to " defend " his project . It was impossible not to love Maurice ; as he talked to each student , the perspiring drawn faces broke into smiles , the clammy hands relaxed , the stammered " Yes sirs " gave way to good talk . Everyone felt the difference between the man who was an artist himself and the pompous director who , if he made a criticism , always seemed to be about to write down a grade in his little black book . With instinctive tact , Maurice did not greet Francoise as an old friend but looked at her designs exactly as he had looked at all the others ; if anything , he was more severe with her . Francoise was notp243a bit shy now that she was speaking of her work . She spoke passionatelyin defense of her bare stage , of what could be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That is adequate , mademoiselle . You need not go on , " he interrupted . " You are to answer questions , not deliver a lecture . " Francoise glowered at him , blushed to the roots of her hair , and shut up like a clam . But she felt better when Maurice gave her arm a gentle squeeze as he passed on to the next drawings . " Stupid old fool , " Antonio whispered , and that was comforting too . How she hated authority ! How she longed to be out of school and doing her own work ! It was time for the students to go into another room and wait for the results . As soon as they were seated in the small theater , the buzz of subdued conversation rose to a roar . Boys and girls shouted across to each other ; a disagreement in one corner turned into a fist fight . In the middle of the noise , Francoise sat very still in a knot of anger and pride . Flow angry Mamie will be , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could n't wait now to get home and tell them . In an amazingly short time the director , followed by Maurice , looking artificially solemn as if he were playing the part as well as he could , walked out onto the stage and the director raised his hand for silence . Like magic , the roar ceased and there was absolute stillness . The wild animals became in an instant an attentive host of young , upturned human faces . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he began , and coughed deprecatingly , " we can not possibly express the deep satisfaction and pride we feel in having had the distinguished assistance of our most celebratedman of the theater in helping us to decide the various merits of your designs . " Someone in the back of the hall coughed deprecatingly in a perfect imitation of the director , and a gale of laughter swept the theater . Francoise watched with delight how Maurice swallowed a smile as if he were swallowing a piece of chocolate . The director flushed , brought his hammer down furiously on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of voice : " I must ask you to restrain your levity . This hysterical atmosphere is hardly appropriate to the solemnity of the occasion . " The laughter made itself felt now like a physical earthquake  --  soundless , but shaking shoulders and chests with violence . " You are savages , " the director went on icily . The savages now engaged in an epidemic of nose-blowing , innocent coughing , and squeaks quickly suppressed in sneezes . Francoise began to be frightened . It was really too much . They were going too far . " I will wait for appropriate behavior from you . " The director looked as if he were about to have apoplexy and sat down , crossed his legs , and put on a patient face as if it were a mask he had just taken out of his pocket . For a second hysterical laughter and chastened silence hung in the balance  --  a single giggle might have tipped the affair over into open revolt . They had laughed at the director so much behind his back that this outbreak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to hear the results . Curiosity won just in time . As quickly as it had come , the laughter passed over ; for an eternity the students sat once more in strained silence . Wrist watches ticked as loudly as grandfather clocks . The director waited . Finally he rose and announced , as if he were meting out punishmentsto the unworthy , that Mr. Maurice Bernard had named Jacques Francais first , Francoise Duchesne second , and Antonio de Marco third in the contest . " You are dismissed , " he said quite unnecessarily as the shouts and applause rocked the hall . Francoise , smiling , triumphant , wearing her success like a rose in her mouth , pushed her way out of the crowd of hands and arms , patting her , embracing her , shaking her two hands , and made her way to the stage . Maurice jumped down to throw his arms around her and kiss her on both cheeks.  | " To think of it  --  that little Francoise  --  that little Francoise  --  and I never dreamed ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in magic . " Here , let 's get out of this  --  come along with me and celebrate . " It was all like a dream . Francoise found herself sitting beside him in the racing car , being driven with careless grandeur , the horn blowing , " Malbrouk s'en va-t-en guerre , " crazily down the wide avenues , to one of the big cafes on the Avenue Louise . Maurice never stopped talking , praising , admiring , laughing loudly over the students ' demonstration against the director . " Oh , " he said happily , " I like this country . I love these people who never will take any kind of authority seriously  --  what a splendidgang of boys and girls . What spirit ! Ah yes , one must know how to laugh in this world , Francoise  --  and to cry , eh ? " he said , turning to her solemn and radiant face and almost knocking down a policeman . She had always adored Maurice . He was the antithesis of her own family , perhaps that was one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresponsible about money , full of fantasy as a child , and with a child 's amoral nature . He was in debt  --  he had made his wife unhappy  --  he was not to he trusted  --  and yet  --  and yet  --  the very people who seemed to relish his misadventures loved him in spite of themselves . " He 's an artist , " they would end with a shrug , as if that explained everything . " He 's a genius  --  what can you expect ? " The Duchesnes , critical as they were of him , always ran to meet him with cries of joy whenever he came . And always when they were children he had come laden with presents  --  the kind of presents no one else ever thought of  --  an immense teddy bear when everyone else considered Francoise too old for toys ( she still kept it always on the end of her bed ) , a living white rabbit for Solange when she was still a tiny child . " Do you remember the rabbit you brought Solange years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do remember him . " " And how Solange cried when he disappeared  --  it was awful . "  |p246Never  , never had Francoise imagined she would be talking like this to Maurice ; walking with Maurice into a cafe where the headwaiterbowed and scraped and murmured , " This is an honor , " and gave them the best corner ; Maurice ordering , as if it were the most natural thing in the world , a Chdteaubriand aux pommes frites , a cress salad , a bottle of Chateau-Neuf du Pape  --  and Francoise felt almost frightened when she saw how much it would cost . They had been brought up to be as frugal as birds  --  a dinner like this in a big restaurant was unheard of . Oh , what she would have to tell when she got home ! " What are you thinking about , eh ? With those great shining eyes ? " Maurice twinkled . " I was thinking how jealous the family will be . " " They wo n't be worried ? You had n't better phone ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said rather grandly . And again Maurice looked at her , amused and delighted . " Oh , you do , do you ? " " Well , I 'm grown-up , you know . I graduate next year . " Yes , she was grown-up indeed , with a waiter gravely pouring wine into her glass , another waiter whisking her plate away and putting in its place a perfect round succulent steak covered with sauce Biarnaiseand with a mound of tiny thin fried potatoes beside it . " Yes , " Maurice answered with appropriate gravity , " you seem very grown-up . Your scene designs are extremely good , Francoise , did I tell you that ? " He lifted his glass and looked at it speculatively , while Francoise , her fork suspended in mid-air with the first heavenly mouthful of steak on it , waited breathlessly for what he would say next . " Let 's drink to doing a play together one of these days  --  only first you will have either to eat your mouthful of steak or to put it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her glass . They drank silently . " Mmm , " she said , " that 's good . " She was wondering how to ask him more about what he had said  --  a play at the theater  --  andp247when ? And what about Jacques Francais ? It would n't be fair if he did n't get a chance . Maurice was eating and drinking with obvious relish and did n't notice her hesitation . He went on , " I have great plans for next season  --  we 'll go to Paris , for one thing . With a repertory of Belgian plays . I want to get a dramatization with music of Till Eulenspiegel  --  how would you like that ? How would you like to do some designs for that this summer ? " " But what about Jacques Francais ? He was first , " Francoise wrenched out of her . " Who 's he ? What are you talking about ? " " The boy whose designs were best for Peer Gynt  --  they told us that perhaps you would " " Oh well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have forgotten all about it . His designs were good , but I am really more interested in you  --  Oh , do n't worry about that . " He pushed Jacques away as if he did n't exist . Francoise 's face , which had been open and smiling a moment before , now closed as if she had pulled a visor down and wore a helmet . She had always heard how it was , how one had to know the right people , make contacts , and often the students had told her enviously that she would never have to worry as she could step right into her mother 's business . But the idea was revolting . The violence , the purity in her flashed out suddenly . " It 's not fair , " she murmured almost inaudibly , but Maurice saw her dark face turned away from him , the tears of anger in her eyes . " Why , my dear child "  --  he threw his napkin down and reached over to take her hand  --  " do n't be upset . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the world . Come , do n't be a little goose . " He must make her smile again somehow . " You 're a little puritan like your mother . I would never have believed it ! But , Francoise , " he pleaded , " it 's my business and mine alone "  --  he laid a hand on his chest  --  " whom I choose to design for me . What in hell does a prize at some stupid school of design have to do with it ? " he asked in exasperation .   Everything around their meeting had been gay , magical , impossible Oh , let it stay like that just for tonight , Francoise said to herself desperately . I am a fool to care . I must n't let this spoil everything . But she was down in a dark hole and she could n't climb out . She drank her glass down in one gulp and was surprised at the effect it had almost at once . She began to feel dreamy and pleased with everything , with her steak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyebrows raised in an amused question as she glanced at him . " Am I a goose ? " she asked thoughtfully . " I suppose I am . " " A beautiful goose , a snow goose , that 's what you are . " He poured charm over her , dressed her in charm . No one had told Francoise she was beautiful . The boys at school were much too shy ; sometimesher father said so , but she knew what he really meant was that he loved her and not that she was beautiful at all . She was flushed now with the wine and the food and all that had happened . " Oh , I 'm so happy , " she sighed . " That 's better . For that you shall have an ice cream , a Coupe St. Jacques . " " May I have chocolate instead ? " she asked hopefully . " You may have anything you like  --  and two demitasses , waiter . " And then to amuse her , to make her go on laughing with pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour about the actresses in his company ( he was a perfect mimic ) , about the scenes they made over their clothes , about the plays he would do , about the theater itself , with the mixture of hatred , exasperation , and passion which it always raises in its true lovers . And Francoise listened , delighted , like a child at a play , drinking in the lingo , the atmosphere , learning it by heart . " There , " he said at last , " now I have a rehearsal , and you must go home . I 'll have time to drive you part of the way if we can get this turtle of a waiter to bring us a check . " But when he said good-by he kissed her on both cheeks and made her promise to give him some designs for Till by the fall , P249that he would count on her , that she must n't have any more foolish ideas . What would the family think ? She was too excited to be frightened on the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her own powers to be scared of any man . But when she got home there were lights on everywhere ; and when she burst in , full of her story , she found the whole family moving furniture , her father carrying an armchair up from the salon , Solange with a broom in her hand , Mamie with an armful of sheets and blankets . They leaned over the stairs and , before she could speak , announced : " Schmidt is coming  --  he 's coming from Switzerland  --  in a plane  --  he 'll be here tomorrow . Is n't it wonderful ? We are making BoBo'sroom into a study ! " It was a great night . No one got to bed till long after midnight . They praised Francoise 's luck , sitting around the table eating bread and pear jam and drinking hot chocolate , and heard the story over and over . Solange asked , " Tell us about the steak again . " And Mamie , " He really wants you to design a play ? " And Colette , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were so tired and excited they talked about everything at once . What a lot had happened in one day ! But in her room alone , when the excitement had subsided and the house all around her was dark and still , Francoise felt dissatisfied , jarred , as if she had been floating along on air and had been jolted down to earth . The family had not taken her worry about Jacques Francais seriously at all ; they had brushed it aside just as Maurice did . It was not her sense of justice that suffered so much as that hard core of independence she had created for herself . She did not want to depend on people 's kindness , on their interest , to do what she dreamed of doing . At the school she knew well what would be said  --  she had been already " hors contours " because of her mother 's position . Maurice 's interest was probably half friendshipfor her family . She was set apart by privilege  --  they would be right to say so . Would she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed with her hands behind her head , staring at the ceiling . No , that was not it at all . It was not that . It was somethingquite different . It was that she longed more than anything now to be taken in , to be part of the company of her contemporaries , to be accepted for herself , to share in their struggles . In that instant her whole attitude to her own life suffered a violentchange . She was so excited by this new idea of participation with others that she could n't sleep . It was like coming out of prison . Why not do a play with the people at the school ? Why not make something of their own ? In the dark still house she was not alone . Each in his bed lay wide awake , burning with expectation , leaning out from his closed secret garden , each in his own way , to embrace the world . The silence of the night was full of longing and of love . The next morningeveryone , even Pierre , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school so that the whole family could go to the airport together  --  all except Francoise , who could not afford to take a day off so close to the examinations . Their work of the night beforewas only a beginning  --  the whole house had to be scrubbed and polished , and all this to be done before eleven o'clock , when they must set out on the great expedition . They worked fiercely , joyfully , in the relief of at last being able to do something for Schmidt , to serve him , to show their love and their admiration by making sure that every pane of glass let in the sunlight ( it was a beautiful clear morning with a powder of frost on the grass ; the garden looked like fairyland ) , by heating an unheard-of amount of water so that he could have a hot bath , by making his bed withP251the fine linen sheets from Paul 's parents ' house . Paul went down to the cellar to bring up the bottle of Quetsch in his honor , and then paced restlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an agony of impatience . It reminded him vividly of that afternoon in 1920 when they had first seen Schmidt after the war . But they must n't overwhelm him  --  and Paul hurried down once more to tell Melanie and the children not to shout , to be very gentle and quiet and restrain their affection . They hugged one another to get a little of the exuberance out of their systems . And finally the time came to leave . Of course they were early and of course the plane was late . They stood in the wind and the sun , half frozen , stamping their feet , blowing their noses . Paul had gone into the restaurant to get warm , but nothing would tear the others from their whole view of the sky . They looked and looked until their eyes ached . Where was it ? Could something have happened ? He was coming from so far , from so many perils , not until they saw him with their own eyes could they be quite sure , could they quite believe he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " for him this is not the joy it is for us . He has left everything  --  we must n't be too happy . " And then , as they tried to take the smiles and hide them somewhere ( but nothing could dim their shining eyes  --  and Pierre had gone quite white with emotion ) , at last they saw it , a speck on the horizon , so tiny it could never have crossed the mountains , and then suddenly larger , roaring over their heads so they waved madly and shrieked and all the rest of the crowd wondered whom they could be expecting  --  a brother , a sweetheart ? Clumsily , like a big bird , unaccustomed to land maneuvering , the plane which had looked so small and light hummed heavily across the field . Now they were silent as Paul ran out of the building pulling on his gloves , shouting excitedly , as if they could n't see , " Well , there it is ! "   And there he was , smiling too and waving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot about not being happy and they swarmed around him shouting , " Hello , here we are ! " Melanie threw her arms around him and kissed him warmly . He shook Paul 's hand . He turned to Colette , hesitated , and asked , " But this is not Francoise ? " " No , it 's Colette , the middle one , and this is Solange our youngest . You will see Francoise tonight . And this is Pierre Poiret , Emile 's son  --  you remember Emile ? " " Of course . How do you do , Pierre ? " Now that he had arrived , it seemed to take an eternity before they could bundle him up and carry him off , take him home . The passport official was as slow and stubborn and hard to convince as every passport official would be from now on . He examined every paper in Schmidt 's wallet , and in his brief case , slowly and methodically . He turned the passport itself over and over in his hands . " You understand that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " It is forbidden to take a job during that time . " " I understand that . " Melanie and Paul stood beside Schmidt ; Melanie kept her hand firmly on Paul 's arm to prevent him from exploding with anger . " Have you friends in Brussels ? " " We are responsible for Herr Schmidt , " Paul said stiffly and formally , but he looked as if he would kill the man gladly . " And who are you ? Identification papers , please . " The Duchesnes now had to submit to a cross-examination . How long had they known this German citizen and under what circumstances ? What was Paul 's profession ? When he said " philosopher , " the passport official raised his eyebrows cynically . " You earn your living as a philosopher ? Why are you not connected with a university ? " " That is none of your business , " Melanie broke in angrily .   " I asked your husband a question , madame . " " I have private means , " Paul answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maison Bernard , " Melanieinterrupted . This seemed to annoy the official extremely . " Oh , so you 're in business . Well , why did n't you say so at once ? " " I am going to report you for rudeness , " Paul said icily . " Youbehave like a Nazi . This is Belgium . " The man turned red . " I 'm sorry . I shall have to have further guarantees . It is my duty to make sure that everything is en regle . You will have to wait . " " But he has a visa from the Belgian consulate in Geneva ! " Melanie protested . " I 'm sorry . " The official disappeared into an inner office with all Schmidt 's papers . " Do n't worry . I am used to this . This is nothing , my dear friends . Please do n't be angry , " Schmidt said gently . " It 's outrageous ! " Melanie stamped her foot with anger . " Petty officialdom , bureaucracy , " Paul muttered . All their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man who had given up everything , family , country , profession  --  everything -- to come to freedom , and now he was being treated like a potential criminal ! And they were helpless to do anything . But Melanie had an idea . " Paul , telephone Francis at once . He has influence . For heaven 's sake , get us out of this . Tell him to come here if necessary . " " What is happening , Mamie ? " asked Colette anxiously . The children had been waiting half an hour in the car . " It is not , " Schmidt said quietly , " a very honorable thing to be a German citizen this year . He is quite right , your Belgian official . " " Oh , this is awful ! " Melanie said bitterly . " Run along , Colette , we 'll be there as soon as we can . Papa is telephoning Francis . " An hour later Schmidt 's passport and papers were handed back to him but with regret . The official seemed thoroughly disgruntled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said angrily and as if he had hoped his duty would involve sending Schmidt back to Switzerland . " You do it in an intolerable way , " Paul answered . All the way home he was too angry to speak . He drove grimly while Melanie and Schmidt talked about the children and the businessand the garden . She felt forced to talk about these safe subjectsbecause they could not yet ask Gerhart about himself . In the back the children sang to keep warm . But as they turned into the avenue , everyone fell silent . " This is it . This is your avenue , is it not ? " Schmidt asked . At last they had him safe . They were opening the green gate . " Run ahead and light the fire in the salon , " Melanie called to thechildren . And Solange called back , " You can have a hot bath at once . We heated lots of water this morning ! " At this everyone laughed , glad to have something to laugh about . " He looks quite clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking a glass of Quetsch , smoking a cigar , as he had done years before , with the children gathered around him listening to him as if he were an oracle , Melanie sewingin the big armchair , Paul stretched out on the sofa . Silently Schmidt tasted his liqueur . " Yes , yes , " Paul murmured half to himself . He was thinking how sixteen years before Schmidt had broken down and told them it was terrible in Germany . And now ? " It seems unbelievable that you 're here . " Melanie looked up and smiled at him warmly , and then she added because she could n't wait another moment , " How did you manage ? Do tell us , Gerhart , tell us the whole story . " He smiled deprecatingly . He smiled a great deal , just as he had always done , and almost mechanically , as if it were a form of politenessand not hard to do . But always as if it were something to be done , not a spontaneous communication from the heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made the decision itP255was surprisingly easy to get away . I had a doctor friend diagnose t.b . and arranged with a sanatorium in Switzerland . Officially I shall be in Davos for the next six months . " After all their visions of his wandering alone through woods , hunted by the Gestapo and perhaps crawling over the border at night ! " Oh , " Solange said with such obvious disappointment that Schmidt laughed aloud , really laughed for the first time . He turned to her then earnestly . " Things are not to be imagined  --  you see , life is at the same time so perfectly normal and so perfectly abnormal . I was in great danger , as a matter of fact , but the danger was intangible  --  it never materialized . " He waited a moment , unconscious of their bewilderment , choosing his words with care , speaking a little stiffly as he always did in French . " You see , the danger was inside . In me . I could n't make up my mind to leave . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical business of getting out just meant a little ingenuity , a little courage  --  yes , I confess that at the Swiss border I was badly frightened for a moment  --  but that is nothing . Of course if I had stayed two weeks longer it might have been impossible . I had to decide , " he said again , painfully , half to himself . The whole family listened in silence . Pierre , who burned with questions , felt that he had no right to speak . They were awed by this experience , more strange , simple , and terrible than any they had known . For the first time Schmidt 's face showed his inner agitation ; he rubbed his forehead with one hand , back and forth , back and forth , as if he were rubbing away a knot inside . " You ca n't imagine what it is to leave one 's own country , " he said almost in a whisper . Melanie was quick to protect him . " Do n't , Gerhart  --  do n't talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all the time in the world . "  | " I want to tell you , " he said earnestly , " but I am tired . " It was all empty around him  --  they felt it , the emptiness , as if there were a chill in the air . Subdued , silent , Solange and Colette went out into the garden hand in hand . Schmidt went to rest in his room and unpack his one small valise , which Pierre insisted on carrying upstairs for him . Melanie slipped an arm through Paul 's ; they stood and looked out at the familiar battered white table and chairs under the apple tree . " Oh , Paul , " she murmured , " how lucky we are . " " Yes , yes , " he sighed . It was , for once , a perfect clear day ; the leafless branches of the trees shone like golden wire against the pale blue sky . " I could n't leave this , " she said suddenly . " I could n't  --  leave you . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Paul answered simply . " Poor man , poor man , " she repeated ; " poor man . " " We do n't understand yet what is happening in the world  --  we do n't know . " He went softly upstairs , leaving her alone in the salon . Melanie was glad there were things to do , the roast to put into the oven  --  yes , it was high time . She had managed to get a roast of Australian beef . Once more she felt tangibly supported by the framework of her life , by the house , the table to be set , the things to be done . She hoped , incongruously , that Gerhart would enjoy his dinner . But after a funeral the sensible Irish eat a great deal , weep themselves out , and then eat and drink mightily . Could they help Schmidt back into life with these simple things : food , the family , work in the garden ? It seemed the whole reason of their existence at this moment to try to do so . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world itself , into cutting the beans into thin , thin slices , into seeing that the oven was just hot enough , into marshaling the children to their holiday tasks . P257And Schmidt , lying on his bed , tense , exhausted , relaxed as he heard her voice call : " Hurry up , children , the table must be laid  --  I need your help , " and Colette and Solange 's flute voices answer from far off : " We 're coming ! " When the bell rang for lunch he was fast asleep . He woke with a start , wondering where he was , suddenly hungry . They each had a tiny glass of beer ( two bottles were divided among them as a celebration ) and behaved as if its effect were that of champagne . The chill , the emptiness seemed to have been driven away by the Australian beef . Solange , whose irrepressible laughter could never be held in check for long , convulsed them all , including herself , with an imitation of her hated mathematics teacher whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onion , " or " Old Potato , " or , worst of all ; " Old Salad . " And Schmidt insisted that Paul do his imitation of a concert pianist , which he had not done for years but which the children had clamored for when they were little . And that led them to speak of Bo-Bo , to all sorts of humorous and tender memories . " But where is Francoise ? I dam longing to see her , " Gerhart said as they got up to go into the salon for coffee . By now he was firmly established in the family as " Uncle Gerhart . " " She must be quite grown-up . " " Oh , she is , " Solange teased , hanging onto his arm , looking up at him , and shaking her curls . " She 's very grand and grown-up . We never see her any more . She works all the time . " He had already admired the set of flower paintings in the dining room and now wanted to hear all about her and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred his coffee thoughtfully and turned to Melanie with a bitter smile . " She is making these beautiful paintings and scenery for the theater  --  and you see , Hans "  --  they had been careful not to mentionHans , and everyone stiffened as his name was spoken  --  " Hans is being trained now.in the arts of oppression and violence . Yes ,   he is being taught systematically and scientifically how to beat up the Jews . " " No , it 's not possible , " Melanie said fiercely . He nodded his head . " It does not seem possible , but it is so . You see , you can not imagine , " he said softly . " No one can imagine . We Germans ourselves do not imagine . My wife , for instance , does not want to know what Hans has become . She refuses to admit it , in her mind . She has shut it out because it is too painful . " He was speaking passionately now , though he never raised his voice , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You see , when he comes home he looks so fine and strong , and he is a handsomeboy , brown and tall , holding himself well  --  and he is gentle with his mother , a good boy at home . He tells us that he is helping to make a new Germany , and she sees him fine and flaming before her , and she does not visualize what this means . She will not believe it . " " She does n't believe you ? " Melanie asked tentatively . " She has n't seen the things I tell her with her eyes  --  she has seen Hans , and he is better and dearer to her than any argument . Here you have already heard many terrible stories , I am sure . You think of Germany as a place of great suffering , intolerable brutality and suffering , and it seems inconceivable that people do not protest . But you must understand that these stories are not heard in Germany . Oh , one here perhaps , one there  --  but it is so easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over an isolated case , to put it down to individual enmity or brutality  --  in every country the police are apt to be brutal . There is always some excuse . And each time one has made the excuse , silenced one 's conscience , it is a little easier the next time . So that now , after three years , things that no one could have accepted in the beginning seem almost inevitable . " " But there must be many people like you who are not like that ? " Colette asked . A spasm of grief , pain , bitterness passed over Schmidt 's face , as F her words had been a physical blow . " That is what one wouldP259have hoped . " He shook his head from side to side miserably . " It is so difficult to tell you , to explain , what it is like  --  If we professors could have got together at the very beginning , taken a stand together  --  butwe were not organized . Many were unconvinced of the necessity for action . And then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly disappeared . Their families disappeared . It was as if they had never existed . " He hesitated a moment . " It was easy to persuade oneself that it was better to go on existing , to do what one could secretly , and otherwise to conform . Two of my colleagues committed suicide . Two escaped at the beginningone a Jew  --  they are in America now . One died in a concentration camp last year . At first I stayed because I could help friends who needed my help  --  my oldest friend , the lawyer Jacob Goldstein , was shot while trying to get over the border . We believe that he must have been denounced . " He was speaking rapidly now , feverishly , as if he wanted to tell them everything as fast as possible . No one spoke . They listened . They felt the wind of fear in the room , the taste , the smell of fear . Just a hundred miles away , just across an invisible border line , these things happened . Life was like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss ? That is the question I have asked myself over and over . The shame  --  the shame of it  --  " he said , covering his face with his hands as if he were unable to look them in the eye . " But the people are not like that . I do n't believe it , " Pierre broke in , his eyes blazing . " The trade unions , the organized Left " " I do n't know . I do n't understand , myself , " Schmidt said quietly . " But it does not happen all at once . It is not white and then black . The choices are never so clear . The people have been slowly poisoned until they do n't know themselves what has happened . They do n't want to know because they have been given a faith , and that was what they needed . " You must not forget , Pierre , that in Germany freedom , democ racy , meant starvation for many , misery of every sort , shame , de-P260feat , despair . Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you we have hope , we have pride , we have full employment , we have food . These are a kind of freedom . And then , " he went on , speaking directly to Pierre , " there is no such thing as the People . There are in a time like this only individuals and individualconsciences . The strongest and the bravest were the first to go  --  hundreds are dead already or already broken . You can break the spirit  --  that is what is so frightful . I have seen it happen . " Solange got up and went over to her mother , sitting on the end of the chaise longue , stroking her mother 's feet . She was on the brink of tears . Before he went on , Schmidt got up and shut the door , an involuntarygesture of which he was n't even conscious . Melanie understoodnow suddenly why he had been speaking so softly  --  he could not realize yet that there was no danger of being overheard . " I came to you so full of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said as he came back . " It might be better to be silent . " " We have to know , " Colette said sharply . " Yes , dear child , " he said gently , " you are right . You do . I will tell you a story of someone I knew slightly and afterward heard much of . I believe that I must have made the decision to leave as a result of this man . He was also a lawyer , an Aryan . " He smiled . " You see , one falls into the Nazi terminology in spite of oneself . He had the courage to defend a Jew in a small case of robbery , and though he lost his case , his defense was an impassioned plea for justice and so an attack on the Nazi courts . Shortly afterward he was tried for sedition  --  this was . two years ago . He was given a mild sentence , and this so enraged the Party that he was taken out of prison before his sentence had elapsed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , they were much too clever to let him die there . They sent him back alive to Frankfort , alive and apparently sane , an old , white-haired , broken man . He is very gentle now . He does n't bother anyone . He can be seen and pointed out sitting in the sun on a bench reserved for AryansP261in the park . His presence is a constant reminder of what opposition to the Party means . " For a moment Melanie wondered if she would not ask the children to leave . The tears were rolling down Solange 's cheeks , silently , though she was making an enormous effort to hide them . But no , they must know the truth . They must be given this weapon of knowing . She had no right to protect them . Colette seemed frozen into thought , hunched up in her chair , her chin in her hands . " I wanted to be able to go on fighting , " Schmidt went on . " You see  --  " " But if everyone leaves , Uncle Gerhart  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing will happen in Germany for a long time , I believe for many years . The Nazis will be there for a long time , perhaps a cen-tury . " " No . " Melanie dropped the sock she had been darning . " That is impossible , Gerhart . " " The alternative is war . " " Yes , " Paul answered quickly , " I know . " " And no one but the Nazi is prepared for war , " Schmidt went on . Then he saw Solange crying . " Oh , my little one , " he said in German , " liebchen  --  we must not despair . " The sobs that Solange had held down until now burst out , and she threw herself onto Melanie 's breast , crying bitterly . " She is too young  --  I am so sorry , so sorry . " He turned to Melanie , his troubled eyes dim behind the glasses . " No , " Solange sobbed , " no , I 'm not too young . " " No , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must n't he , darling , for lacking self-control ? We must learn to face these things , to be able to face them , Solange dear . That is the least we can do . "   " I  --  I 'm sorry . " She got up and ran out of the room and Colette followed to comfort her . " I hate the Germans ! " she cried when they were safe in the nursery , " I hate them . Why are they there , always there ? " she cried in a passion of rage . " Ever since we were little it 's always been the Germans , the Germans . Why ca n't they leave us alone ? " She was in a real fury , wanting to break everything in the room , tear up , destroy , and there was nothing to throw but the pillow which she hurled on the ground . Colette waited for the tantrum to be over , brought her a washragto wipe her face on , and then sat on the bed beside her with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German and you do n't hate him . " " Yes , I do , " she sobbed . " There 's no peace anywhere . " She felt as if their whole life had been invaded by evil and terror and that it would never be the same again . " They 'll come here . They 'll kill us all  --  they 'll put us in concentration camps , " she sobbed . " We have to be ready , " Colette said severely . " We have to have courage . Mamie is right . " Solange embraced Colette with all her force , clinging to her passionately . " We 'll stay together . Nothing will part us ever , will it , Colette ? " And Colette answered , " Of course not . " But she was thinking  --  having made her decision in the last hour  --  I 'm going to be a doctor . Next year at the university I can begin . It was an enormous relief to have decided that once and for all . Pierre came in , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . " I feel ashamed of my whole life , " he said . Colette looked at him in amazement . She resisted the impulse to say coldly , " It 's about time . " From the window , if they had looked out , they could have seen Melanie with her pruning knife , up in the apple tree , and Paul and Gerhart , wrapped up in coats and mufflers , pacing up and down , P263up and down the garden paths in the sunlight , talking philosophy . Gerhart was quite unaware that he had already made a revolution in the house . It was true , their lives would never be quite the same again . Now , after two orthree weeks of fine weather , St. Martin 's little summer faded and the interminable cold and damp of a Belgian winter set in . The sky closed down like a lid . The garden looked desolate , and everyonewore sabots outside because of the mud . The excitement , the emotion , and the great decisions raised up in the first week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more its routine pattern . Paul was apt to find excuses to stay at home in order to be able to continue his endless discussions with his friend ; Gerhart himself , who had been unable to work seriously for a year , set himself to writing a short book on Nietzsche  --  a defense of Nietzsche against the Nazi appropriation of him . Pierre worked fast and carelessly at his novel  --  he was no longer interested in it , but hoped to make a little money on it . And then he had decided to go into the army as an officer 's candidate . In the morning the men had the house to themselves . In the evening , when the whole family gathered for supper , they sat around the table for hours talking . It seemed as if Uncle Gerharthad always been a member of the family  --  they took him for granted . They teased him about his admiration of Francoise , who had always been his particular friend ; they saw that he had the best cut of meat and the largest egg ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own private difficulties and growing sense of exile . In making the decision to come , he had still been wrapped upp264in Germany  --  it was his relation to Germany which had forced the decision . He had not imagined what the new life he was embarking on would be like , what it would be like once he had left , to know that he would probably never go back . His safeness here , the cherishing atmosphere and the influence he saw that he had on the Duchesnes , bringing them their first direct experience of Fascism  --  all only served to set in relief his inner loneliness , his sense of loss , and the question of what he could do in the end . In his talks with Paul he always emphasized the importance , the necessity for work of a philosophical and spiritual nature . He believeddeeply in what Paul was trying to do and respected his solitary effort . But the book on Nietzsche was an exercise rather than anything else , something to do , until he should have come to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt a need  --  and it was strange and against his nature and all his habits to feel it  --  a need for active service of some sort . He was nearly fifty and ill equipped for anything except a professorship : it was possible that the University of Brussels would offer him a visiting lectureship for one year . Paul was pulling wires to bring this about . But , althoughSchmidt had responded gratefully to the idea , in his heart he was reluctant to undertake it . He had begun to keep a notebook , jotting down a sentence or two every day , as if he were keeping a record of an illness , a chart of his progress as an exile . Perhaps much later it would be useful to others  --  or , if not , it gave him at least the illusion that his sufferingmight someday serve . His terror was that , now he had taken the huge step of leaving , it would prove to have led nowhere . Anything active he undertook now would risk endangering his wife and son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not share them , and when he himself was safe , seemed practically impossible . He would have to take another name , bury himself in a life so different from his old one that he would not be traced . He slept badly . The fears he had mastered while he wasP265in Germany attacked him now . He woke up several times screaminghoarsely , dreaming that he was being tortured . Of this conflict he said nothing to anyone , only jotting down inhis notebook short sentences : Exile : in its obsolete meaning the word is defined as " To devastate ; ruin . " The spiritual severance and the spiritual attachment  --  to despise what one loves ; to be ashamed of one 's own country . All negative , all destructive , poisoning the power to act . The physical malaise  --  this no one can imagine who has not experiencedit . The very smells are strange ; the food in one 's mouth ; the language . I used to enjoy speaking French . Now I find it a great effort . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that I have expressed myself badly . I feel here almost never wholly myself . There is something missing . The children ask me all the time about Germany . They are fascinated . They listen as to an evil fairy tale . And it becomes more and more painful for me to talk . At the same time I myself come back to the subject and am more savage than I need to be , out of fear of not facing the whole truth . The whole truth ? Where is the responsibility ? How far is the witness of a crime guilty ? When Pierre says , " The German people are not to blame , " can I honestly agree with him ? In the answers to these questions lie my future and the future of many others , perhaps whole peoples . The temptation to feel oneself an exception and so separate , havingspecial rights . The exile has no rights . He has only duties and opportunities . Never to forget that given the choice of martyrdom or exile , one chose exile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , in a sense , justify his choice . To seek out the levels and the conflicts where the struggle , which is perhaps already lost for several generations in Germany , can still be won . Spain ? America ? As far as I can find out , in Spain there is acute awareness of the magnitude of the struggle , of the internationalnature of Fascism . In Spain it is open war ; in America , should I go there , I would be again a teller of fairy tales to children . I am nearsighted , sedentary , completely untrained for a life of ac- tion . How far is this persistent idea of Spain an escape , a quick violent means to solve a problem of conscience ? How far is it a cool decision to go where I can be most useful ? But in the last analysis one does what one has to do . Forcing a decision now is cowardice . I must be patient . I must think . Avoid other exiles . The temptation of the past . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false unity , a sort of stage-set security where we can act out our play The True Germany . So many have n't the strength to do more than this , and who shall blame them who has not known the experience himself ? I am protected because I am separated from my family . I am truly free and alone , so my responsibility is very great . The temptation to despair , to give up because one knows how difficult it was in Germany for an honest man to stem the rising tide . Will he be of any use anywhere else ? Are the people of the free countries , so sure of themselves , really so much braver than we were ? The worst temptation  --  cynicism , to justify one 's own cowardice by pretending to a superior knowledge of evil , and that evil will always win . To give up before the second battle because one has lost the first . And this is really once more the temptation to be a witness and not a participant , the one who sees all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the confusion and difficulty of even the smallest action . What one believes is scarcely important ; it is , I am certain , how one acts on one 's belief . Judge a man not by what he says but by what he does . The people who say they are anti-Nazi in Germany behind closed doors , and have not done anything to prove it , cannotbe believed , or rather , their belief has no virtue in it , no creative power . Is this not really the Christian ethic ? It is here that the passivity of the Church becomes criminal because it is the living symbol of the truth and yet does not act upon it . A man can say he is a Christian and yet in no way behave like one . But no man can say he is a Nazi and not be forced to do something sooner or later to perpetrate or be a witness to positive evil . And it it so much easier to do evil than to do good that the good man must be a thousand times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferocious than the evil or he will have no chance . In the end it is all almost unbearably simple  --  it comes down to the individual conscience . And here philosophical inquiry is important , must go on . I suppose what separates me so painfully from Paul is that I feelP267responsible , am in a sense guilty . It makes a gulf between us . He has a right to go on with his work quietly . I no longer have that right  --  more than that , it has become spiritually impossible for me to do so . It was on a Sunday afternoon in late November when Gerhart wrote the final paragraph . As he sat at his desk , looking out at a steady hard rain which the wind had slanted so it looked like the rain on Japanese prints , he felt more peaceful , more truly at peace with himself than he had for a long time . He had become accustomed now to the landscape outside his window ; it no longer looked strange and foreign , was no longer to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner life . So he sat , wrapped up in a blanket to keep warm , and lit his pipe . The tinkling of the tea bell roused him and he went down to find that there were guests for tea , Francis and Simone , whom he remembered as old friends of the Duchesnes . Always now he felt a slight hesitation in meeting strangers , dreading the shock of discovery , dreading the necessity to explain himself once more , dreadingpity as much as disagreement . The salon , as he pushed open the door , looked full of people  --  and he was glad to take the tray out of Solange 's hands and so make his entrance as one of the family . " This is Uncle Gerhart , " Solange said proudly , as if she were exhibiting something greatly to everyone 's credit . Francis rose to shake hands , and Gerhart went over to the chaise longue where Simone , as always , was stretched out , to kiss her hand . " We have been meaning to come to see you , Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great pleasure , " she said warmly . " Sit down , Gerhart , and have a cup of tea quickly before Francis starts asking you so many questions that you wo n't have a chance to drink it , " Paul said in his teasing voice . " Perhaps I will ask him so many questions that he wo n't have time to ask me any , " Gerhart said , smiling his formal smile .   The children passed the big plates of bread and butter and jam while Simone and Melanie kept up a steady conversation about how prices had gone up , about the garden , about the children , about the new Lenormand play Simone had seen in Paris . And then , when everyone was settled , when everyone was supplied with bread and butter and tea , there came a pause , a silence , as if they were all waiting for someone to take the plunge , to come out with it , whatever it might be . For there was something in the air , and Gerhart felt it at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said gently , " is it not so ? " Melanie and Paul looked at each other half amusedly and half guiltily , and Paul turned to Francis . " This is the most devilishly perspicacious man we have ever had in the house . He had not been here two weeks before he knew all our secret problems and was busily at work helping us to solve them . He is , you know , a sort of St. Nicolas , performing daily miracles . " The tribute was so unexpected that Gerhart blushed to the roots of his hair . " Nonsense , " he murmured while the children shouted at his blushes and Solange had to get up and embrace him . " But it 's quite true , " Melanie protested amid the laughter . " The conspiracy , " Francis said smilingly , " if there is one , is that Paul and Melanie have some crazy idea that you and I are going to disagree , Herr Schmidt . But we will show them that it is quite unfounded . " " Heavens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gerhart said . " This is not fair . " He looked so much like a frightened schoolboy that Solange felt it necessary to go to him ; she sat down on the floor by his chair while he stroked her hair absent-mindedly . She tried to hide her pleasure at this mark of affection by looking as solemn as possible . " Let 's examine them instead , " Francis said . " Let 's make them tell us why they think we will disagree Ah-ha ! " he said , as if it were a game , pointing his finger maliciously at Paul . " NowP269we 've got you . " Yes , it had suddenly become a game , and yet underneath the children felt the suspense . Frangoise was frowning her deep frown of rejection and disapproval whenever political discussions came up . Melanie looked at Simone for support and cut through all these preliminaries by stating simply : " It 's just , Gerhart , that Francis does n't believe there will be war . " " Why discuss it ? " Francoise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If there is , there is ; if there is n't , there is n't . And no amount of arguing will affect it one way or another . I am sick of all this talk . " Everyone turned and looked at her in amazement . For Francoise , who rarely spoke in any gathering , it was an amazingly long and passionate speech . Before Melanie could scold her Schmidt had interposed gently , " She is quite right , you know . Let us talk of something else . " Again there was a silence and this time an uncomfortable one . It was as if they were under some spell and things could n't come out right . " I was in Berlin a month ago , " Francis said , lighting a cigar and lighting Schmidt 's for him on the same match . " Ah , then you see , he knows far more than I do . " Schmidt was delighted with this chance to escape . " What was your impression , Francis ? " Melanie asked . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said half apologetically , and Schmidt answered at once : " Do n't apologize . I 've never liked it myself . I 'm a Frankforter , you know . What do they talk about in Berlin these days ? " " The anti-Semitism is perfectly deadly , as you all know . I was assured , however , that Germany had no territorial aspirations beyondpossibly the Sudetenland  --  this has not become official yet , but I gather they will start a big propaganda war about it very soon and expect the English to back them up . Everyone told me they were astonished at the ease with which they reoccupied the Rhine- land  --  even high officers had believed that they were taking a great risk . Well , after all , that was inevitable sooner or later . " Gerhart Schmidt listened attentively . With all his heart he wished not to enter into an argument with Francis . It was a far greater effort to him than he ever showed to argue with people , especially in French . And disagreement had always tasted like ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy with Francoise . It was one of the things that drew him to her . But at the same time he knew that he had no right to keep silent . Outside Germany as he was , safe as he was , the least he could do was to tell the truth constantly , and never to shirk doing it just because it happened to be a Sunday afternoon and he was for once feeling peaceful . " Did you hear anything about Spain , for instance ? " he asked tentatively . " I did n't hear anything directly , of course . But I gather that they are very pleased with the behavior of German planes , especiallythe dive bombers , and that a good deal more help is being sent than will ever be officially admitted . Why ? " Francoise tried to imagine a way to leave the room without being noticed , but gave it up after a while . She was interested in the two men rather than in what they were saying  --  they were so very different . Francis always looked rosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath and had been singing in it . His optimism , his buoyancy were evident even in his dress , his bright ties , his way of smiling quickly and warmly and leaning forward as he talked , and he talked quickly and emphatically with enthusiasm . Uncle Gerhart , on the other hand , seemed almost absent-minded by contrast , as if he were always thinking ahead to something he was coming to and had n't said yet . He seemed both wary and tired , and always he spilled cigar ash on his waistcoat and then brushed it away without looking , so that he was apt to brush a clean place and leave the ashes just where they were . But Francoise felt they were both essentially gentle people , friendly people , and under normalcircumstances there could have been no antagonism between them . They would have enjoyed each other  --  they both liked to laugh . But now for the last few years the terrible thing was that people born to like each other got into fierce hateful arguments . It was like a sickness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had hardly listened to the conversation which had moved a long way in the last quarter of an hour . " You are a pessimist , Herr Schmidt , " Francis was saying . He was perhaps a little nettled by the children 's obvious rapt attention to everything Gerhart said ; for the first time there was an edge of exasperation in his voice . " Do n't you see , " he went on , " that anything we do now against Germany means war ? Do n't you see our hands are tied ? Surely the occupation of the Rhineland proves that . " " But are they tied in Spain , where Fascism can still be openly fought ? Would it be so impossible for us to sneak a few planes across the border and four or five divisions ? " " You are oversimplifying , Herr Schmidt , " Francis said , shrugging his shoulders . " I think he 's right , " Melanie said decidedly . " We ca n't let innocentpeople suffer . We have a responsibility . " " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives are at stake , " Francis said passionately . " Is there peace in Germany ? Is there peace in Spain ? Or in our hearts here now ? " Gerhart answered quietly ; but his eyes behind his glasses had narrowed . " That 's metaphysics  --  what goes on in the hearts and minds of people is a matter for priests and psychoanalysts . " " Why , Francis . " Simone sat up in astonishment . " You surely do n't believe that . What a terrible thing to say ! " " Well , if you 're talking about peace in the heart , you 're talking about Heaven as far as I 'm concerned , " Francis answered sharply . And Gerhart was thinking , What a waste . What a senseless quarrel . It was time to put a stop to it . It was time to make his own position quite clear .   " Yes , yes , " Paul murmured . It was the first time he had spoken . " Well , " Gerhart said , smiling as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can . That is all . You do your damnedest to keep the peace of Europe and I shall go to Spain . " " You mean that really ? " Pierre asked excitedly . Colette and Solange looked stunned . It was like a sudden change in weather , a violent frost , a blight . No , he could not be going away ! That was impossible ! " Yes , I have decided . It is what I must do . " " But , Gerhart , " Melanie said , as if she were scolding a child , " no , you ca n't do that . Why , you 're not a soldier . You 'll be no good to them . " " Yes , Gerhart , what is this romantic idea ? " Paul asked . " You 'll never get papers , " Francis added , as if that were final . " I think he is quite right , " Colette said emphatically . " Darling , no one asked your opinion . " Melanie was shocked ather air of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become part of the - family . Solange curled around where she was sitting on the floor so she could put a hand on his knee . " Do n't go , Uncle Gerhart , we need you here . We need you , " she said passionately . " I 'll come back , my bird . As you all know , I 'll probably be put to some perfectly safe job like censoring , as I 'm afraid it 's true that I would not be a very good soldier . " " But , Gerhart "  --  Paul was angry himself now  --  " what an utter waste ! How can you think of burying yourself in such perfectly useless work when you are a philosopher ? How can you abandon all that you have begun in the last twenty years ? Other people can do clerical jobs . No one can write your books . " " I ca n't help it , Paul . I 've got to be part of the struggle somewhere . I did n't leave Germany and my family to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that ? I could not live with myself . I could not write . I 'm sorry to distress you and to have said this so suddenly without preparation , " he said , P273turning to Francis with a mischievous smile , for now he had come out with it , Gerhart felt very happy . " But somehow or other our discussion forced it out of me . " And then he got up and took Melanie 's hand . " You have been so kind , so wonderfully kind , " he said gently . " I think I will go upstairs now if you will excuse me . " The children rose in a body , Francoise first of all , and followed him without a word , as if they were attending a funeral . " Yes , yes , " Paul murmured . " We must be going too . " Simone felt that it was time they left . The Duchesnes obviously wanted to be alone . " What a tragedy ! " Francis sighed . " A man with so much to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Francis ? " Paul asked ironically . " You know , I envy him . He has reached a place we still have to reach . He has made peace with himself . " " Oh , Paul , you sound so sanctimonious , " Melanie broke in . " All that will happen is that he 'll get killed by some senseless Italian bomb , and what good will that do ? " Once more there was a great rift in the security of the house and the garden and of all their lives  --  and through it blew the cold wind of fear , of desolation , the wind that was gathering power , that would become hurricane . And what did they have to pit against it ?
