In six months seven U.S. oil companies have folded their rigs and suspended drilling in Colombia . Last week Shell , having sunk $90 million trying to get profitably established , announced that it was forced to curtail operations . That left only two small outfits drilling for new fields in Colombia . Three big U.S. companies ( Socony-Vacuum , Texaco and Jersey Standard 's Tropical ) have put too much money into old , producing fields to pull out now ; but they have virtually given up trying to find new oil for the present . <P> Reason for suspension was that Colombia had just about succeeded in pricing itself out of the oil business . While Venezuela 's tough but sense-making petroleum code fostered a billion-dollar industry , Colombia 's confusing , ultra-nationalist oil laws had crippled efforts to develop resources . It often took ten years to get an exploration concession through Colombian courts . After that , the million dollars spent on drilling a new well would be subject to tax whether oil was found or not . Extra-legal riders of one sort or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government take , in taxes and royalties , sometimes ran over half the value of a company 's net revenue . " Colombia , " growled an oilman in Bogota , " is the graveyard of oil profits from other countries . " <P> But Colombian politicos did not seem disturbed by the virtual shutdown on wildcatting . Their country was bigger than Venezuela , they reasoned , with coffee , gold and other cash products besides oil . Many even argued that an oil boom would hinder the country 's all-round development , and pointed to oil-rich Venezuela 's deficient agriculture and industry for proof . " What will Venezuela have to show for lying supine before the drillers ? " snapped a young Colombian oil-ministry bureaucrat . " Holes , that 's all . "
