txt The death of Lord Keynes will be felt almost as deeply here  --  and , for that matter , throughout the civilized world ? as in his native England . His ideas were controversial at their inception and remain so today ; but even his severest critics conceded his great intellectual gifts , and none has attempted : o deny his enormous influence on contemporary economic thought and on the practical governmental policies , both here and in Great Britain , which followed from that influence . John Maynard Keynes may almost be said to have been born an intellectual and an economist . Like John Stuart Mill , he was the remarkable son of a remarkable father . That father ? John Neville Keynes  --  who , at the age of 93 , survives his more celebrated son ? is himself the author of works on logic and on economics which still hold positions of high authority in their respective fields . John Maynard came into international prominence when he resigned his position with the British Treasury to protest against the economic clauses of Versailles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That book had a variety of qualities that led to instant acclaim . On the literary side it was a brilliant piece of writing . On the economic side , at a time when no Allied statesman dared to talk anything but nonsense concerning the reparations that could be extracted from Germany , it reminded the world of the actual state of Europe at the end of the war , " a matter of life and death , of starvation and existence , and of the fearful convulsions of a dying.civilization . " Keynes ' book was , perhaps , eventually too influential for the world's. good , for it underestimated the German ability to pay and overstated the inherent difficulties of transfer . But at the moment of its appearance it was a sorely needed corrective to extravagant expectations and impossible demands . It was Lord Keynes whose ideas dominated the Bretton Woods agreements , for which he worked so tirelessly . He was the chief British figure in conducting the Anglo-American loan negotiations which , it is to be hoped , Congress will soon ratify . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next decade as the author of the " General Theory , " a book setting forth highly unorthodox ideas of the causes determining interest rates , prices , employment and prosperity . No one has attempted to deny Keynes ' great intellectual gifts , and both disciple and critic are likely to subscribe to the wise and eloquent passage at the close of the " General Theory " : The ideas of economists and political philosophers , both when they are right and when they are wrong , are more powerful than is commonly understood . Indeed , the world is ruled by little else . Practical men , who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intel- lectual influences , are usually th slaves of some defunct economist Madmen in authority , who hea voices in the air , are distilling their frenzy froth some- academic scrib bier of a few years back . I an sure that the power of vested in terests is vastly exaggerated corn pared with the gradual encroach ment of ideas . * * * Soon or late , 1 is ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil .
