Letters BEATEN PATH TO THE EDITOR : As a concert pianist who has consistently and sometimes to his advantage tried to answer the question asked in the title of Mark A. Schubart 's excellent piece , " Does It Have to Be Beethoven ? " I should like to comment upon some of the ideas expressed in the article . Undoubtedly it is ever so much easier to follow the beaten path for both performer and audience . I think the trouble lies in the fact that the great majority of celebrated ? . and therefore " big box office " ? performers choose to serve their public rather than lead them . Surely an audience will prefer  --  sound unheard , so to speak ? Tchaikovsky , Chopin or Rachmaninoff to Roger Sessions or Darius Milhaud , but it is the task and duty of the performer  --  be he a conductor , soloist or leader of a chamber music organization ? to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand and appreciate the new works , in which he . the performer . believes . ANDOR FOLDER . New York SOUND SLEEPER TO THE EDITOR : In a note accompanying Mark A. Schubart 's article on modern music , " Does It Have to Be Beethoven ? " Olin Downes is quoted as having written of Stravinsky 's " Sacre du Printemps " : " We now take our ' Sacre ' as a nightcap , thank you . " It may interest Mr. Schubert to know that the first time I heard the " Sacre " Soporific ? one Sunday afternoon some years ago at Carnegie Hall , it also struck me as a " nightcap " ? for all of its noise and " new speech . " I fell asleep . WILLIAM S. Lapiniqcorr . Montclair , N. J. Anyone who has not slept through the " Sacre " will conclude that Mr. Lippincott could dote in a boiler factory . ? Editor . NO SLIGHT TO THE EDITOR : My article in the Magazine of Sept , , 22 told the story of the Fourth Marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as the headline seemed to indicate  --  purport to tell the full story of all units . Previous accounts of the Corregidor siege have been published in military magazines , but none of them has done more than mention the Fourth Marines . My article was not intended to slight Army or Navy units , but to give overdue credit to an " outfit " that had been largely ignored by contemporary historians . HANSON W. BALDWIN . New York . MORE TO THE EDITOR : The most revealing , the most soul-stirring- article was Hanson Baldwin 's " Corregidor : the Full Story . " We need more of them . ELEANOR BRESHEARS . New York . RETORT To THE EDITOR : Since S. J. Woolf in his letter thinks you printed my article , " A Modernist Explains Modern Art , " as a personal compliment to him and since name-calling is the main weapon in his arsenal  --  which weapon he certainly handles with incisive cleverness  --  it will not be amiss to become personal for a moment . I did not mention Mr. Woolf in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unimportant . As artist he is unimportant because , trained in the skilled copying of surface facts which is our inheritance from the nineteenth century , he has never overcome that training with its implications of decadence in the long historical view . Leon Battista Alberti , writing about 1460 , said , " The old painter Demetrius greatly injured his glory because he was more zealous in catching resemblances than in attaining beauty . " Mr. Woolf is in the same predicament as Demetrius . He does not understand what kind of " beauty " can be distinct from that seen in nature . As critic of modern art Mr. Woolf is unimportant because of his impressive ignorance . In my recent books , New Art Education and Experiencing American Pictures , I have tried to state the case for our creative rebirth so simply that even Mr. Woolf would understand . If I and other writers have failed it may not be our fault . RALPH M. PEARSON . Nyack , N. Y. 0141EILLIARA TO THE EDITOR : It happens that just before seeing the article on Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came across some verses by O'Neill written in 1912 and printed in The New London Telegraph . Here are some stanzas , called by Clark " characteristic " : They told me the water was lovely , that I ought to go for a swim , The air was maybe a trifle cool : " You wo n't mind it when you get in . " ... I girded my icy garments ' round my quaking limbs so blue ; And I beat it back to the bathhouse to warm up for an age or two . Heed not the tempter 's chatter , pass them the skeptic 's grin ; For the greatest bull That a boob can pull Is " It 's great when you get in . " They shed an interesting sidelight on a great playwright 's progress . M. ARGON . New York . IT MOVES TO THE EDITOR : I 'd like to ask what rulers Anne O'Hare McCormick had in mind when she wrote in " As If It Were the Day After Waterloo " : " To argue over minor affairs as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Galileo must have felt when the rulers of his day drew their maps and based their pot . idles on the assumption that the earth was flat . " It is difficult to believe that there were rulers in Europe in Galileo 's day who supposed the earth flat . Galileo was born in 1564 , and Magellan had circumnavigated the globe more than forty years before that . ELOISE LIDDON SOM . New York . Mrs. McCormick nodded , apparently forgetting the famed dictum attributed to Galileo : " Eppur si muove ( Still it does move ) . " Eppue she made her point. ? Editor.
