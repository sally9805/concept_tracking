Music : ( In and down under : ) MEREDITH " For what avail , the plow or sail , Or land or life , if freedom fail ? " Music : ( Up and out . ) MEREDITH This is Burgess Meredith speaking from Hollywood . Last Sunday I read a statement about the principles upon which the Free Company was founded  --  something about its membership and something about what it has accomplished . I want to repeat that statement today , for the benefit of those in the radio audience who missed it last week.Some people have too little faith in America . Some people have been listening to harsh voices from across the seas , and the voices have been getting louder . Some people are just confused . It was to deal with this confusion in one way , in one medium of expression , that a group of writers and actors , and Columbia itself , formed The Free Company.The Free Company has the endorsement and cooperation of the Attorney General of the United States and the Solicitor General of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their talents to the proposition that we have in this country a way of life that is unique and precious , and something to be infinitely proud of . It 's the American way of life , in the spring of 1941 , with all its flaws and all its problems  --  still the best way of life on earth . Who are some of the members of The Free Company ? Well , there 's James Boyd , chairman of The Free Company , and the author of the series of American historical stories  --  " Drums , " " Marching On . " " The Long Hunt " and " Bitter Creek . " He 's a dollar-a-year man at the Department of Justice , and served as First Lieutenant in the A.E.F. at St. Mihiel and Meusse-Argonne offensives.Robert E. Sherwood , chairman of The Free Company writers , is a Pulitzer Prize winner with a list of more than half a dozen stage successes to his credit , of which his latest is the anti-totalitarian play , " There Shall Be No Night . " He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . Then , there are other eminent Americans  --  Paul Green , Archibald MacLeish , Sherwood Anderson , Stephen Vincent Bent , George M. Cohan , Marc Connelly , Norman Corwin , Ernest Heming way , Elmer Rice , William Saroyan , Orson Welles , and many others . Columbia 's vice-president in charge of broadcasts , W. B. Lewis , is a member , and Columbia supplies the production , the music , some of the cast and the time.All these individuals form a Free Company , a company to interpret the true spirit of the Bill of Rights  --  the honest way , the American way of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Today , Maxwell Anderson writes on freedom to worship God . Here we take that freedom as a matter of course . But it can be lost and the playwright shows us a nation where men not only may not worship God each in his own way , but where they may not worship any God at all , except the State.We present Paul Muni in " The Miracle of the Danube , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under first narration : ) p. 3 MEREDITH Under the medieval towers of an ancient fortress on the banks of the Danube , a military trial is being held . Officers sit square and erect on tall , hand-carved chairs about a long table . ( Sound of meeting coming to order . ) The officer in charge is General Merck , a veteran of the first World War . A major and several other subordinates sit with him , to share the examination . The accused prisoner is Captain Cassell , now somewhat worn and worried by imprisonment and uncertainty . MERCK Captain Cassell , I have known you and your work for several years . You have been recommended to the higher command for acts of distinguished service and for devotion to our common cause . Nevertheless , as these officers know , there is no possibility of leniency toward those who have knowingly , or even unwittingly , abetted the enemies of our nation or our cause . We shall hear the charges against you in order . Lieutenant , read the accusations . LIEUTENANT ( Reading ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the charge of Captain Cassell , escaped during a transfer . This was held accidental , and was passed over at the time , but is now recalled , because of later occurrences . MERCK I allow you to speak in regard to that charge , Captain . p. 4 CASSELL Thank you , General Merck . It is true . They escaped . MERCK You have nothing to say about the circumstances ? CASSELL I would have given my life  --  to avoid  --  any betrayal . MERCK We shall go into that later . Read the next charge . LIEUTENANT ( Reading ) On February 10 , 1939 , Captain Cassell was in command of the firing squads at the Moravian prison . Seven graves were dug at his order to accommodate the prisoners executed on that day . Only six of these graves were filled , and no trace of the seventh body was found . This also was passed over as an error in the records . MERCK Do you wish to comment on this , Captain ? CASSELL Yes , General Merck . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the greater part of the years 1939 and 1940 , Captain Cassell was employed among others in the work of transferring populations in Central Europe . This work necessitated occasional executions and the stranding of refugee groups within restricted territorial limits . Captain Cassell appeared to be an exemplary officer , eager to carry out the policies of the State . They knew him as The Reaper . His headquarters were known as Castle Blood . He was depended on more and more by his superiors . p. 5 MERCK You will note , Captain , that we give you , all possible credit ? CASSELL I tried to be a good soldier , General Merck . MERCK Continue . LIEUTENANT But there began to appear certain cracks and lesions in Captain Cassell 's efficiency . Four religious leaders , determined enemies of the State , slipped through his hands into Sweden , with a number of followers , and were not recaptured . There was a riot at a concentration camp on the eastern border and the Captain failed at a critical moment , to give a necessary order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrusted with the liquidation of a large body of undesirables who had been collected at a southeastern boundary . These men and women escaped . Escaped in such fashion , that Captain Cassell must be held responsible . It has been found necessary , therefore to subject Captain Cassell to military trial . MERCK Captain Cassell , you are aware , no doubt , that these are capital charges ? I ask you directly . Were you remiss ? Were any of these lapses intentional ? CASSELL No , sir . MERCK Then how do you explain them ? CASSELL I  --  I can not . MERCK Come , sir . You are your own enemy . We are all friendly here . We do not intend to lose so valuable a servant from the ranks . Begin at the first lapse . The three women who escaped into Sweden . How did that happen ? p. 6 CASSELL There were four of them . Three women  --  and a man . MERCK In the records , there are only the three . CASSELL Yes . The man joined them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them was ill  --  and he was taking care of her . He seemed to be a kind of doctor . MERCK But the escape ? CASSELL It was his doing . His , only . MERCK But how ? CASSELL He spoke to me  --  about the women . He spoke to me very strangely  --  and for some reason , I could not take my eyes from his face . He had a way of speaking at once passionately and slowly  --  so that you waited for his words . MERCK Come  --  what does this mean ? Did he talk you into letting them go ? CASSELL No . I refused him . I laughed at him . I despised him . MERCK But the evidence shows that a catch had been overlooked on one of the doors and that the three disappeared into the night . CASSELL Yes , that 's true . But not because I was affected by what he said . Not because I connived at escape . I laughed at him , as I said , and turned him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I looked personally at the lock on every door . Perhaps in my anger at this vagrant , I was not so careful as I should have been . He stood there talking and made me angry . But if there was an oversight , it was , I assure you , unintentional . p. 7 MERCK For the moment , I shall accept that explanation . Let us look next at the seven graves which were dug for those sentenced to be shot on December 9 , at the Krug fortress . Six men had been sentenced , six Polish Jews convicted of sabotage while working on the great central military road . Your records , however , show that seven men were ordered before the firing squads , seven graves were dug , and that the orders for this seventh execution were cancelled at the last moment . On the face of it , this looks like connivance at escape . CASSELL It was the custom in the Krug fortress , to place those condemned to death , in a common cell . I shut those six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw to this personally . Then as I turned away , I saw this seventh man with them . MAJOR A seventh ? CASSELL Yes , Major . MAJOR Who was it ? CASSELL It was the same man who had argued with me about the women  --  on the night of their escape . MERCK How did he come there ? CASSELL I did n't know how he came there . But he was there  --  and I said to myself  --  This time nothing shall go wrong ! He 's got himself , somehow , into the death cell with the condemned ! Very well , let him die with the others ! I know I had no right to order an execution without sanction of the court , but that man was my evil demon  --  he 'd got me into trouble once , and he was trying it again ! p. 8 MERCK Calmly , calmly , Captain . CASSELL Very well , I ordered him shot . The prisoners were marched from the cells , and he came with the others . He stood up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down among them , telling them to have courage . But when the firing was over , when they were shot down , he was not among them . His body was n't there ! MERCK Where was it ? CASSELL I do n't know ! I tell you I do n't know ! But was this to be held against me ? Would I have ordered him shot if I 'd wanted him to escape ? MERCK Calmly , calmly ! CASSELL I ca n't speak of him calmly ! I 'm sorry ! MAJOR You made an effort to locate this man ? CASSELL We made every effort , Major . The guards were questioned . The locks were examined . The civil and military authorities went over the ground inch by inch . They found nothing suspicious . MERCK Let us proceed to the next charge . In the summer of 1940 , you were conducting a consignment of prisoners from the eastern border to a Baltic port . Among them were four ministers who had banded together to resist the interpretation of Christianity which is orthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their followers , escaped from the freight car in which they were being transported . This car was under your guard . p. 9 CASSELL The car caught fire , General Merck . It was necessary to open the doors . MERCK In what fashion did the car catch fire ? CASSELL I  --  I can not say how the fire originated , sir . MAJOR This man who escaped at the time of the executions  --  did he have any part in the escape from the box-car ? CASSELL Yes  --  ( Pause ) . Yes  --  he was there . MAJOR What part did he take in the affair ? CASSELL I  --  It 's difficult  --  MERCK Tell us the story of that escape . CASSELL All of it ? MERCK Yes  --  from the beginning . CASSELL I will try . It will not be believed . However , I will try . We were in the car . I saw his face among the other prisoners in the car . ( Fade out ) I was walking ( Cut-back ) . CASSELL You  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come forward ! How do you come to be among these prisoners ? p. 10 STRANGER I came in with them . CASSELL Do you know what prison they 're bound for ? STRANGER Yes . CASSELL Do you know the reputation of that prison ? STRANGER I do . CASSELL Then that 's what will happen to you , my friend . You have pushed in once too often where you 're not wanted . First torture then death . STRANGER I am accustomed to torture . CASSELL And to death , too , I suppose ? STRANGER Yes , even to death . CASSELL Who are you ? STRANGER Do n't you remember ? CASSELL No . STRANGER The picture in the silver frame ; the reproduction of the Giotto that hung in your mother 's room ; the face in that picture . Surely it comes back to you now . CASSELL What are you trying to tell me ? STRANGER The plainest , simplest truth . My face is the face in a picture by Giotto . CASSELL Do n't talk rot like that . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 STRANGER But this is not fantasy . My face is that face . My hands are those hands . My garments are the same . CASSELL What do you mean ? How could you be a man out of a picture ? I see you before my eyes  --  and you 're real . STRANGER The others here have not seen me . See  --  they stare at you  --  because you talk with the empty air . ( Pause ) CASSELL You lie ! You lie ! You 're trying to confuse me  --  to mislead me ! Why are you here ? STRANGER You bring me here . You create me out of your mind  --  out of your horror and regret , for the blood you have spilled . For the man you were . You bring me here  --  because you hate yourself and what you do . CASSELL We shall see whether you arc real ! We shall see ! ( End of cut-back . ) CASSELL I sealed the car doors together ; I kept my automatic ready against an escape . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught fire . Soon it was necessary to open the door for air . Our car was the last on the train , and I therefore climbed to the roof and thence down to the coupling , which I loosed . When the car was free , I set the brakes and we came to a stop in the dark near a village . At the point of my automatic , I held the prisoners within the car while I ran to look at the housing . Then I saw that I had somehow been fooled . There was no fire . I turned to the car door in a rage  --  and the prisoners began pouring out  --  that painted face in the lead ! I emptied my gun at him point-blank  --  and he did not fall ! I swear to you , General  --  I swear to you , gentlemen  --  within three paces , I fired ten times at his heart without effect , for he stood and spoke to me still ! The other prisoners made off in the dark . Then he , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car in the night . p. 12 MAJOR And you expect us to believe that ? CASSELL No , gentlemen , I do not expect you to believe it . I wake in the night and say to myself that it can not be true  --  that I am a respectable officer , that I am sane , that I live in a sane world where these things can not happen . There are no ghosts , no shadows , no things like men that will not fall when you shoot them through . I know that . And yet this happened as I have told it ! MAJOR Did you ever see this man again ? This figure out of the Giotto painting ? CASSELL Not  --  for some months . MERCK In justice to the Captain , perhaps I should tell you of his conduct after this episode of the box-car . He came to the general staff with a request that he be put under some rigorous mental and physical discipline . He was sent to an academy in the Black Mountains and there underwent a course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hours of labor and instruction , no comforts , cold water , a Lacedemonean diet . After six weeks , Captain Cassell emerged from this training , a new man . He was placed in charge of the liquidation of a certain province . He became known at this time , as the Grim Reaper . The faltering which had marked his previous actions , had disappeared . He showed no aversion to violence or the shedding of blood . For nearly a year , he led the way among the military protectors of that region . There was talk of making him governor-general over the whole area . p. 13 MAJOR What was the nature of your work at this time , Captain Cassell ? CASSELL I was in charge of the extermination of the intelligent . All leaders or thinkers , all writers or artists , all who stood out in any way , were arrested and in some fashion eliminated . MAJOR Did you feel any reluctance in carrying out this work ? CASSELL ( Desperately ) None . It is not the business of an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , I am convinced and was convinced then , that it is essential to the welfare of our master nation that we make slaves of our inferiors . An acceptance of slavery is only possible among those who can not think for themselves and who have no leaders . It was my duty , for the good of our country , to eliminate the leadership among the subject people . MAJOR You never softened your blows , never drew back your hand , never allowed yourself to be overcome by pity ? CASSELL Never ! If only because I had made errors in the past . I determined never to slip again ! I had learned my lesson . The time was gone when a face out of a cheap reproduction could come between me and those who were condemned ! MAJOR Do you mean  --  that this face still haunted you ? ( Pause ) p. 14 CASSELL At times . At times . Faintly . I refused to see it . I drew a curtain of blood between that face and me . Then it ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . MAJOR Then this last occurrence  --  this last charge against you  --  the freeing of the boatload of prisoners on the Rumanian frontier  --  how do you account for that ? CASSELL I do n't know ! I do n't know ! MERCK You understand that we must make these inquiries , Captain . Tell us what happened on the river steamer on the Danube . CASSELL I had conducted two hundred prisoners on board the steamer Constanta . There were twenty guards . My instructions were to land the prisoners on a small island near the Rumanian frontier , execute the able-bodied among them and abandon the others without supplies . We arrived at a point near that island at night  --  on the sixth of last November . Since we were unable to locate the channel in the dark , it was necessary to wait ' til dawn before landing prisoners . They slept on the deck , men , women and children . Half of the guards went below deck to sleep , the others remained on duty . I was awake and on deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the moon rose , and I could see an outline of the river bank some mile or so away . As I looked toward that shore , a man came walking out from it . p. 15 MERCK But , Captain Cassell , there was a mile of water , you say , between you and the shore . CASSELL Yes . MERCK Then I do n't follow you . CASSELL This man came walking across the water . MAJOR Is it profitable to listen further , General Merck ? MERCK We must hear him out . Go on , Captain . CASSELL He came walking across the water . Very slowly . It must have been half an hour before he came near enough so that we could see his face . MERCK When you saw it  --  what face was it ? CASSELL The face of the Giotto Christ . MAJOR Your phantom , my dear Captain , your phantom . CASSELL No . This time he was not a phantom . MAJOR How do you know ? CASSELL Because the prisoners saw him . They woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such proof is hardly acceptable . CASSELL Also , I had set the guards at the rail to keep him off the boat , but now the guards were phantoms , and he stepped through them as if they were n't there ! He was real , and they were spectres , with the moon shining through them ! p. 16 MERCK I think you confuse the matter , Captain . The men of the guard were flesh and blood , and this ghostly figure passed through their ranks because he was a shadow  --  a memory of a painted face . CASSELL No , he was real , and the guard was made up of shadows . He was real among them , as he is real among you now . MERCK Is he among us now ? CASSELL You do n't see him ? MERCK No . CASSELL There ! Behind you ! Where the light falls ! You see no one there ? MERCK Nothing , Captain . CASSELL ( To the Giotto ) Why have you come here ? THE GIOTTO Was I ever with you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never called for you ! I have drenched myself with blood to be rid of you ! I have filled the air with screams and covered half the earth with terror to be rid of you ! MAJOR ( Aside ) Would it be possible to declare him of unsound mind ? MERCK We can hardly escape the issue of guilt or innocence . MAJOR And if he is guilty ? p. 17 MERCK The guilty must be punished . MAJOR Very well . MERCK What happened , Captain , after this man came across the water to your ship ? CASSELL He came through the soldiers . They had become like air , unreal  --  they could not stop him . And then this thing came over me , that I had felt before . MERCK What thing ? CASSELL I was glad that he had come . In some horrible way I was glad that I could n't hurt him , glad that he would conquer , that I would betray my rank and my orders ! In some horrible way , it did n't matter  --  for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in a country of ghosts . He and I and the band of prisoners were real . But the soldiers and the nation that lay behind them were unreal . The armies , the men of the government , the men of the secret police , all the forces of our nation were shadows that could not stop a wind ! There was only one reality  --  this man and I on the dark river , and the group of prisoners sent there to die . MERCK And what came of this ? CASSELL I do n't know . I think I must have let them go . MAJOR You mean you allowed the prisoners to escape ? p. 18 CASSELL Yes . MERCK You knew that this was an action deserving of death ? CASSELL It seemed not to matter . MERCK I think we need take no further testimony . To my mind , Captain Cassell is guilty and his usefulness is at an end . Is there any dissent ? MAJOR None , General Merck . MERCK Then the Lieutenant will record the sentence . Captain Cassell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your brother officers , and it is my unpleasant duty to inform you that there is only one military consequence to your action  --  CASSELL You , too , are shadows , you of this court ! MERCK Be quiet , sir ! CASSELL You are all shadows  --  ghostly folk about a table in a city of ghosts . The chairs and walls show through your forms , your voices come from a distance  --  echoes of men  --  MERCK You will face a firing squad in the prison yard in the morning . CASSELL And they too will be shadows ! Why should I fear them , or any among this nation of spectres ? I know now , that I am free of you ! He and I sit together here , and we are real in the midst of a cackling assemblage of shadows ! p. 19 MERCK The court is dismissed . CASSELL Go , and leave me ! I know what you think  --  insofar as you think  --  insofar as you exist at all ! My mind is clear and I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are empty ! And my happiness is here  --  in the face of this one reality , this one friend , who says that I did well when I did a kindness  --  that I was worthiest when I could not kill ! MERCK ( At a distance ) Your prisoner , Sergeant . CASSELL Now that I have said these things they will make an end of me . They will put me to death  --  out of their world . THE GIOTTO They put me to death long ago . CASSELL I must face the firing squad in the morning . Will you stay with me then ? THE GIOTTO Yes , I will stay with you . CASSELL And the night . If I am alone my mind will torture me . Will you stay with me in the night ? THE GIOTTO Yes , I will stay . CASSELL Will you say again the words you said on the bank of the Danube ? THE GIOTTO " No man can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one , and love the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despise the other " p. 20 CASSELL And the rest  --  ? THE GIOTTO Yes . " Blessed are the poor in spirit , For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven . " Blessed are they that mourn , For they shall be comforted . " Blessed are the meek , For they shall inherit the earth . " Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness , For they shall be filled . " Blessed are the merciful , For they shall obtain mercy . " SERGEANT This way , Captain . CASSELL Yes , I 'm ready . MEREDITH So Captain Cassell went to his death because his inner spirit would not be denied . That death was one of triumph and of comfort . He had found again his true belief , had made his peace with God . The freedom of every man and every woman to find that peace is , of all freedoms , the most fundamental , precious and profound . The powers of darkness know that well and that is why , when they would enslave mankind , they strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this threat in other lands , let us renew our resolve that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom that government of the people , by the people , and for the people , shall not perish from the eath .
