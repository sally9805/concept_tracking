The chunky little Marvita was on her strangest assignment . The 122-ton Newfoundland customs cutter , with election officials and ballot boxes aboard , was serving as a floating polling booth for the first election in Labrador 's history . <P> The voting list was the census . That excluded Labrador 's several hundred white stationers who go down north from Newfoundland every summer to live in frame and moss tilts and fish inshore , also the 1,200 summer floaters who fish from vessels offshore . Only the 4,000 year-around white livyers ( meaning live here ) and the 1,500 Eskimos , half-breeds , Nascopie and Montagnais Indians could vote . <P> Last week the Marvita chugged into tiny Hebron , most northern of bleak Labrador 's mission-trading posts . Parka-clad voters padded aboard to mark ballots , picking one of the five candidates-a fisherman , a clergyman , an ex-Ranger , two wireless operators-as Labrador 's lone representative at next month 's national convention in St. John 's . <P> After eight hours at Hebron , the Marvita moved downshore to Nutak , then on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle Harbour next month , she would stop at 37 Labrador hamlets hugging 800 miles of rugged coastline . <P> Tundra Trudgers . So sparsely settled is Labrador that at no point would more than 300 trudge over the tundra to vote . At Comfort Bight there were only two : Fisherman Stanley Green and his wife . At Henley Harbour there were 27 , all named Stone . Bradley John Point 's five were all Pottles , Northwest Island 's 14 all Bakers . <P> Most of the Eskimo voters would be picked up offshore from the missions of the Moravian Brethren who came out from Germany to Christianize the Eskimos in 1764 . Like the whites , the Eskimos are content to hug the coast . Their needs are few : cod , salmon , trout and seabirds for food , seal for their blubber lamps . They neither wash nor cook , and they have no need for roads . The sea is their kayak highway in summer ; during the long winter , transport by husky-drawn komatik ( sled ) is fast and cheap . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . There , in good seasons , they barter their prized Labrador mink and fox pelts ; in bad seasons , pick up their Government dole . Only the Indians wage a battle for existence in the virtually unmapped , unknown interior , and they are losing . Where rigor and hardship have failed to decimate them , intermarriage and the ills brought by the white man have succeeded . <P> The Marvita has just about time enough to complete her job this season . Soon the Arctic ice would seal in the Labrador coast for the winter .
