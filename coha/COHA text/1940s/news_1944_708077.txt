txt Anthony Eden , Britain 's Foreign Secretary , arrived here unexpectedly tonight to touch off speculation encompassing the whole of the political possibilities in the European sitution . At the same time it was announced that the question of American commanders for the final drive against Japan had been decided in advance of the present meeting of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill , thus providing a possible answer to Gov . Thomas E. Dewey 's demand yesterday for elevation of Gen. Douglas in the Pacific Command . Open Forum on Economics The second Quebec conference , labeled at first as mainly military with emphasis on the Pacific , was ' turned by Mr. Eden 's arrival into ! what could be a wide open forum of the Anglo-American leaders on matters ranging from the economic problems that brought Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. , here yesterday , to the grave European questions that required the personal appearance of the British Foreign Secretary . Matters of such weight that they could not be entrusted to diplomatic cables could include a first hand report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer from inside the Reich . With departure from Washington for Quebec tonight of Sir AlexCadogan to talk with Mr. Church // ill , it was assumed that one of the matters the Anglo-American leaders would discuss here would be the impasse in the first phase of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference that appears to have arisen through the reported refusal of Soviet Russia to go along with the British and Americans on the place of small nations in the proposed international security organization , and means to deal with any member of the proposed council that may become an " aggressor . " Pacific Command Not Issue But while the scope of the conference seemed to broaden in other respects , Stephen T. Early , the President 's press secretary , made a statement today that definitely excluded from the conference agenda the question of American commands for the final drive in the Pacific . Although Mr. Early specifically refused to comment on the press , conference remarks made yesterday by Gov . Thomas E. Dewey at Valentine , Neb. , in which he called for a bigger'role in the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no consideration here of A Commander in Chief for the climatic stage of the war against Japan was generally interpreted as providing an answer to Mr. Dewey . " There is no question present in this conference of a new so-called super-command in the Pacific area , " Mr. Early said . " Was it decided in advance , " he was asked . " That 's my understanding , " Mr. Early replied . " But I do n't know whether it 's a new command , the status quo , or what . " He added that " that question came up before we came here and was disposed of . " " Was it decided by the President at his Pearl Harbor conference ? " Mr. Early was asked . " I 've told you all I can , " he replied . Decision Made Earlier Mr. Early 's statement was interpreted here as meaning that the great decision as to Pacific strategy has been made to the extent that the Navy will have its chance to try the bold , knockout blow for victory against Japan which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific , " it was surmised here , will be the naval officer who heads the combined operation calculated to carry the war first to the Japanese islands . It was pointed out that Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in western Europe , commands operations in a relatively limited area of the total European war against Germany . Thus , the " Eisenhower of the Pacific " might not command the several campaign ? ! against Japan that would comprise the whole Allied war against the Japanese , but may be the man whose forces are regarded as having the best chance of delivering the knockout blow first . In the absence of official information from the citadel , where Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill are conferring , it can only be surmised from the logic of developments what the decision as to the Pacific war will be , but there are certain guides that would lead to the conclusion that the final blow against Japan will not be one campaign , but several , and that all of the others will contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry the war to Japanese soil and sink the Japanese Navy under the waters of the Pacific . Leaders Closeted Together Except for a short while late this afternoon when he called on Quebec officials and drove through the city streets to the applause of Quebec citizens who then had their first look at him since the conference a year ago , Mr. Churchill spent most of the day in conference with the President . Mr. Morgenthau and W. L. King , Prime Minister of Canada , lunched with , them . Robin Cruikshank , representative of the British Ministry of Information , said at a press conference that the quotation attributed to Mr. Churchill when he greeted the President on Monday , that he had been " frightfully sick " on the voyage from Britain , had caused some misunderstanding in Britain because the Prime Minister was known to be a good sailor . What Mr. Churchill really told Mr. Roosevelt , said Mr. Cruikshank , was that he had been " frightfully hot " for several days of the voyage .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
