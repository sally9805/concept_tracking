THE BEST OF TIMES ( 188 pp . ) Ludwig Bemelmans - Simon &; Schuster ( $3.95 ) <P> " The average Austrian , " says Bemelmans , " is like the cocker spaniel , helplessly affectionate and sentimental . " Bemelmans himself has been a U.S. citizen since he was a young man , but his native affectionateness and sentimentality ( he was raised in the Tyrol ) still run like a groundswell under his clear prose and brilliantly childlike paintings and drawings . No man can be more superficial than he when commenting on the causes of contemporary misery ( " If politicians can clean up the messes they have made and are making , then Paris will be the old place again " ) , but it is precisely this relaxed laziness of thought that gives him not only his sensuous warmth but his faculty to echo , like a verbatim record , whatever scenes or conversations may happen to brush up against his impressionable senses . <P> The Best of Times is his description of a journey through Europe , for Holiday magazine , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe revisited - a nostalgic , often beautiful restatement of things that have survived , and a horrified reporting of things that now lie in ruin . Like the vivid paintings and drawings that accompany them , the numerous anecdotes carry a rich embroidery of Bemelmanly fantasy . <P> What 's Left ? In Paris the traditional agent de police sketched by Bemelmans as a square-topped pyramid balanced on twin sticks , still stalked the streets in his cap and dark blue cape . The portly headwaiter too , who greeted both Barbara Hutton and Marshal von Brauchitsch with the same bow , had weathered the storm without a ruffle . Georges , the pander of the prewar underworld , had actually improved his status ; he was now a respectable black-marketeer . <P> In Austria , where traditions never die , the new civil servants still played the favorite national drama - gravely concocting and slowly handing back &; forth list upon list of government decrees , which must be " carefully aged , like bottles of rare wine " before they could enter public life . And on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now paying the price of cooperation with Hitler , were playing the same drama as if they were still in it . " Please , Herr Oberregierungsrat , " requested the ex-judge , " will you have the kindness to hand me that shovel ? " " With the greatest of pleasure , Your Excellency , " replies the ex-ministerial councillor . <P> " Not a bad life , " said the Hungarian Count who has lost his huge estates , as he sat darning his seeks in an Arlberg farmyard . " In me you behold the only decent-living Hungarian ... I have never made love to a woman behind her husband 's back ... I have never had an ' affair . ' I have always done it correctly . " <P> " And how is that ? " <P> " . . . Very simple . I have always fallen in love with them and married them-always . " <P> " How often have you married ? " <P> " About ten times , I think . " <P> " But what did you do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with a new one ? " <P> " Oh , I threw her out , of course . " <P>
