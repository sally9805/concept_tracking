If you do n't object to 100 million people eavesdropping on your private life , life can be beautiful-after a fashion . In its role of vulgar Lady Bountiful , radio is showering quiz-answering Americans from its loudspeaking horn of plenty . It supervises their marriages and honeymoons , builds houses for them , gets them jobs-even fixes their teeth or buys them wooden legs . <P> Every Day Is Christmas . Through the openhandedness of sponsors , Americans are now driving new cars , thumbing well-filled bank books , taking jaunts to <P> Europe , vacationing on private islands in Minnesota lakes and sailing the inland waterways aboard their own yachts . All they have to do is to be ready when the time comes to answer some such question as : " How old was Julius Caesar when he married the daughter of Lucius Cinna ? " ( Answer : 17 . ) <P> Radio can even provide a new personality , or renovate an old one . A Twin Falls , Idaho matron who reported that she had " always suffered from inferiority and insecurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , " she testifies , " I can meet anyone , look them in the eye and feel equal . " <P> Every Man a King . Last week New York Star Columnist Max Lerner took a wincing look at the good fortune that radio 's cornucopia had showered on the family of Edward Easton , an unemployed jewelry salesman of Attleboro , Mass . Mrs. Easton had correctly named a tune on ABC 's Stop the Music . Wrote Lerner : <P> " Consider what the horn of plenty poured out for the Eastons : a two-week vacation in Paris for the family . ( After Paris you still need to find a job . ) A place-setting for twelve at the table ( here come the relatives ) . A $2,500 television set ( here come the neighbors ) ... A diamond ring and a diamond watch and bracelet , valued at $6,000 . . . About $4,000 worth of men 's furnishings for Mr. Easton ( all dressed up but where do we go ? ) . A $1,500 wardrobe and an $1,800 ' natural Norwegian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage set . And , for its first use , a trip to New York ' for a complete glamor re-do . ' <P> " If I wrote a novel about the Eastons I know how my first chapter would end . Three minutes after Mrs. Easton answered the phone and gave the right formula . . . the doorbell rang . It was an insurance salesman . He had been passing through Attleboro with his car radio on , listening , of course , to Stop the Music . When he heard the address , he headed for the house . He was Johnny-on-the-spot , the first of an intolerable army of mercenaries . I did n't make up the insuranceman episode . That , too , happened to the Eastons. "
