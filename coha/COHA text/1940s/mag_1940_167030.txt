On the newspaper maps , day by day , the grey shadow bulged down swiftly , erupted in a black spearhead that raced past the ancient , memorable place names - Amiens , Arras , Abbeville-turned and hooked northward up the coast . Claws thrust out , curving , into the pocketed white space . On these daily map-pictures the U. S. watched the Allies thrashing as desperately as a fat bird in a falcon 's talons . <P> The U. S. had passed the first shocked realization that perhaps soon nothing but a shrunken ocean would lie between Adolf Hitler and America . Last fortnight the nation had agreed on the imperative necessity of arming . Last week , as little seemed to come out of Washington but newsreel pep talks , the cry changed to Action-no time now for diddling around , for chitchat , for political guff . <P> There was sympathy for the fatigue lines under Franklin Roosevelt 's eyes , but the nation also wanted action on the dramatic scale of the 100 days of 1933 . Only a few people expected anti-aircraft guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole wanted assurance that industry , finance , labor , politicians would all fuse in a national mobilization for defense . <P> Everyone wanted to help . Hundreds of gossips wrote the Federal Bureau of Investigation volunteering to spy on their neighbors . To Washington flocked businessmen , big &; small , proffering services . The President ordered memos drafted by all of his aides , their ideas to be boiled into a page . The Capitol combined the worried gloom of the last Hoover days with the rampant confusion of NRA Blue Eagle times . <P> Gradually the picture cleared . The President had been repeatedly advised to form a Defense Council , or War Industries Board , to mobilize the nation 's sprawling economy . Mr. Roosevelt moved slowly , carefully . Only last fall his embryo War Resources Board had been quickly dynamited out of existence by Brainmen Tommy Corcoran and Ben Cohen , who insisted that Big Business could not be trusted to run a war . Now the President , at least for the time being , placed the aircraft procurement program under Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who is closest to him of all men-Harry Hopkins , Secretary of Commerce , who moved into the First Secretary 's Office in the White House . Long-legged Mr. Hopkins , whose slouching ease masks the electric speed of his mind , called in business bigshots , squared away at the country 's biggest task . <P> In the brief struggle within the Inner Circle for control of the aircraft program , Tommy the Cork had backed Federal Lender Jones against Secretary Morgen than , who hates The Cork 's guts . Messrs , Jones &; Corcoran had sought control through vast RFC loans to the air industry ; Mr. Morgenthau contended there were no bottlenecks within the industry , there was no bottle . He wanted a new aviation industry , set up on a mammoth scale , and the President agreed with him .
