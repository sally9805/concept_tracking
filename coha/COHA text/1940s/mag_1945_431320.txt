 | Millions of dollars are lying unclaimed in banks from coast to coast ? belonging to people who have forgotten they own the money or who actually do n't know it is theirs . Millions more in every state are labeled " lost " by insurance companies ? belonging to policyholders who ca n't be found or to beneficiaries who never turn up to collect . Fantastic as it may seem , people do deposit from a few dollars to several thousand in banks , then drop out of sight ! Husbands do take out insurance policies for their wives or children , then die without having said a word about it . Sailors start bank accounts between voyages and are never heard from again . Proud parents open small bank accounts for their first-born , then forget the gift and , of course , never tell their child . Immigrants deposit their savings secretly and fade into nowhere . leaving their treasure behind . People lose their bankbooks and mistakenly think that means they 've lost the money , too . Or they stop paying on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim cash already paid . It happens every day , in every city , to thousands of people . Every twelve months our banks and insurance companies go on detective sprees looking for the owners of accounts . Under the laws of many states , any money that has remained dormant in financial institutions for a specified number of years ? ranging from 7 in Oregon to 30 in Connecticut ? is turned over to state officials . The institutions would much prefer to find the missing owner , of course , to protect their clients and straighten out their own books . The laws generally safeguard the owners , too , by requiring that the dormant accounts be publicized in local newspapers before the money is turned over . Thus the annual treasure hunts . Only , in this instance , the hunts are topsy-turvy , for the money is seeking the owner . And the results are sometimes comic or romantic , often mysterious . Right now , for instance , the East River Savings Bank in New York would like to know the whereabouts of one Valeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valeria played on Broadway in several hit shows during the ' 20 's , but since then she has disappeared . Her last known address was a building that has been torn down ; her name is not in any of the telephone or city directories ; she has n't been in touch with her bank since 1929 . The East River is seeking high and low for her , for if she does n't show up in the next few months , her account will be advertised as dormant and then handed over to New York State . And the Union Dime Savings Bank of New York  | would like to find Manoel Servos ( or Zervos ) , a dishwasher ; last known address , 102 West 40th Street , Manhattan . Servos accumulated several thousands in the Union Dime before he dropped out of sight . The bank has searched Greek societies throughout the country , has been in touch with draft boards , the State Department , even the Greek government . But no Servos . If he does n't pop up soon , his fortune also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about John M. Smith , birthplace Philadelphia , business address , Manhattan , who gave his occupation as " A mailer " when he deposited a batch of hundred-dollar bills in a New York bank before 1929 ? There 's a tidy treasure waiting for him if he 'll claim it . And where is Mary Davis , last address , West 134th Street ? Or Lulu Levenson of East 48th Street , Brooklyn ? Or Jose Rodriguez of Oak Street , Jamaica , Long Island ? These are real names , real people who must have struggled hard for their savings . Yet they have vanished . In Boston , recently , a ' corporation offered prizes to amateur detectives who could trace the owners of $5,000,000 on deposit in New England institutions . In Seattle , Washington , the First National Bank has been putting on a radio show in an effort to find its missing depositors and give them back their own money . In New York last fall ten savings banks reported 3,500 abandoned accounts of $10 or more . In Maine , Maryland , New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making thousands of telephone calls , sending out representatives on personal visits to far-distant places , in an attempt to remind their clients of forgotten dollars . One woman walked into a Chicago bank a few months ago and asked if her sister 's name was on a dormant-account list . " Years ago , Mother opened accounts for Sister and me at this bank , " she explained , " but Sister has been living in Canada since her marriage , and , besides , she was always so scatterbrained that she 's probably forgotten her account . " The bank obligingly checked its lists and found not Sister 's name but that of the woman who was doing the looking . It took a lot of convincing to make her believe she was the scatterbrained one . Another successful search reunited a brother and sister who had been separated for thirty-three years . A bank advertised the brother 's account . A friend told the sister about the name . Although sure it was a coincidence , she decided to investigate . And she found it really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . They met for the first time in three decades at the bank . @#  | Sometimes the forgotten cash is delivered at a crucial moment . One life-insurance company tells of its prolonged search for the holder of a $2,500 policy . Finally , after all mail had been returned " unclaimed , " a representative was sent out . After following many leads , he came to a small town in northern Minnesota . " Yes , " he was told , " there 's a person by that name here , but it 's a woman . " He kept on and discovered that the policyholder had died accidentally , without saying a word about his insurance , and that the woman was his widow and beneficiary . Thinking she was penniless , she had moved away from her home town and had taken any job she could get . She was working as a charwoman when the insurance agent found her and gave her her check . It was back in the ' 30 's that legislators in various states suddenly woke up to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books of banking institutions . As one state after another passed laws requiring that these funds be turned over for state use , banks set up human lost-and-found departments and started out to find Rip Van Winkle capitalists , and Insurance companies intensified their already active detective work . John Barrymore 's name showed up on one bank 's graveyard list . But when notified , that fabulous actor refused to claim his $7,500 , on the ground that " my creditors will get it anyway . " Finally his creditors did get it . Just before Barrymore 's death , a lawyer walked into the bank with the proper papers and drew out the deposit . New York 's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia read his name in a dormant-account advertisement . The fiery little Mayor had been " too busy to bother with it . " And as the banks checked through their inactive files , they found the names of Dustin Farnum , star of stage and screen in days gone by ; of Mae Murray , also of silent-film days ; of Neysa McMein , the illustrator ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Laurette Taylor , playing on Broadway now ; of Edna Wallace Hopper , the beauty authority . AND they found , too , that abandoned accounts appear much more frequently in industrial areas and seaports than in small towns , where nearly everybody knows everybody else . They discovered that the most forgetful people are likely to be artists , doctors , and dentists . And they quickly reached the conclusion that rich and poor are identical when it comes to neglecting a bank account . One bank uncovered the name of a rival institution 's president on its abandoned list ! Upon hearing that he was about to be advertised as " lost , " the president in person delivered a $100 check to make his account active . In another case , an officer of a Rhode Island bank recognized the name of one of his neighbors as a " missing depositor . " Any number of reasons may be responsible for a lost account . In one instance , the treasurer of a church died , leaving his records in such chaos that no one could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , where it was . Years later , when the treasurer 's name was advertised as the owner of a $600 dormant account , the minister declared  | it was heaven 's answer to his prayer for a new roof . In another instance , an uninformed woman said her reason for neglecting her deposit was that her children had torn up her bankbook and she thought that meant her money was forfeited . In a third , a daughter was astonished to discover that her father had deposited $500 in her name when she was born . " Father died when I was a child , " she said . " And no one ever told me I had this money in the bank . " Probably the most frequent cause of dead accounts is sheer forgetfulness . One man hurried into a Philadelphia bank the day after his name had been advertised as a " lost depositor " and demanded that the bank apologize in print . " I never had an account here , " he said . " You have made me look like a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name was as advertised . Signatures were compared , and they checked ; addresses were compared , and they checked , too . The depositor finally was obliged to admit that the money was his and that he long ago had completely forgotten his early thrift . Lots of banks have on their books small accounts for clubs and unions that are headed straight for the graveyard . Once upon a time the societies existed , collected dues from their members , and deposited them . But now the clubs are gone , the members have scattered , and their dues will end in state cash boxes eventually . SUCCESSFUL as many of the hunts have been , the total of unclaimed honey in America today still runs into the millions . And it 's a virtual certainty : hat after the war the sums will skyrocket , for many of our fighting men will have forgotten their savings accounts or wo n't return to claim them . And despite the fact that rightful owners may get back their funds even after the periods of grace have expired and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an account at that late stage is a gigantic task indeed . So watch those " unclaimed " lists when they 're published from year to year , to see if your name or the name of a friend or relative is included . Look around your attic or unused desk for a forgotten bankbook or lapsed insurance policy or old bond or stock certificate , and check on their value . Ask your husband tonight if he left a bank account behind in the dim years of the past . It 'll be an exciting game by itself . And it may reveal a hoard of lost treasure !
