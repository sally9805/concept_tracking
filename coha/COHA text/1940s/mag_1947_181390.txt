Dan Bankhead had a fine old Southern name , a good fast ball and a fair curve . For the Memphis Red Sox in the Negro American League , he had won ten games against five losses . Branch Rickey personally scouted him and decided he could help the Dodgers . <P> Last week , in his Brooklyn debut , big ( 6 ft. 3 in . ) Dan Bankhead , fifth Negro player to reach the majors , winged Pirate Outfielder Wally Westlake with a fast ball . A few breaths were tight-held-this might be the " incident " that many baseball men had feared . But Westlake trotted casually down to first . It was clear that , within the space of a single season , fans and players alike were beginning to take Negro players for granted . <P> Brooklyn 's Jackie Robinson had done his part in the club 's pennant drive , hitting .300 or a few points over or under and leading the league in stolen bases ( 25 ) . Of the other four Negroes in the majors , the St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released after a month 's trial ; Cleveland 's Larry Doby was still hanging on , as a pretty impotent pinch hitter . <P> Whether or not Bankhead would bolster the Dodgers ' sagging pitching staff might take some time to tell . In his 3 ? inning relief stint against the Pirates-on a day when Kiner &; Co. really had their hitting shoes on-he gave up 10 hits and 8 runs . He could n't ever do much worse than that , and he looked as though he could do quite a lot better . His batting , on the other hand , could not be improved on : his first time at bat , Bankhead fouled off several pitches , then banged a home run into the left field stands .
