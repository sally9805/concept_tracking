Dr. Paul R. Hawley , onetime Veterans Administration medical boss and now executive director for Blue Cross-Blue Shield , is dead set against compulsory health insurance . He is also a realist . In Washington last week , speaking to the District Medical Society , he sounded a warning : doctors getting set for an all-out fight against compulsory health insurance had better put their own house in order . Hawley had been talking to people all over the country , he said , and " I 've come to the conclusion , with a great deal of regret , that the confidence of some of our people has been shaken in the unselfishness and spirit of public service in the medical profession . "
