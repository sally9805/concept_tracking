A FEW YEARS AGO there was in a large American city a residential section chiefly inhabited by Jews . Eventually the more well-to-do Jewish families moved away , though the poorer ones remained . Negroes , most of them also poor , moved into the vacated dwellings . The area was badly overcrowded , with few public recreational or other facilities . Tension began to mount dangerously close to the point of explosion . One day a baseball thrown from a schoolyard broke a window in the house next door . There was a mad rush of the frightened group of boys from the scene , in the course of which a Negro boy was accidentally knocked down , struck his head on the curb and was killed . Wild rumors ran through the district ; a riot seemed likely . Practical solution . At this juncture , a team of trained experts in inter-group relations was sent into the district to study the situation and see what could be done . They analyzed the facts-carefully to be sure they were accounting for.all of the elements in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste their time making speeches about the dangers which come from prejudice , or distributing leaflets showing how minorities ought to stand together . Instead , they unemotionally pointed out to the Jewish and Negro leaders that the area badly needed a playground ; the broken window which had caused the death of the Negro boy had resulted from an attempt to play baseball in a completely inadequate area . Leaders of the two groups saw the point . They began collecting funds to buy land for a real playground ; most of the contributions which poured in were a dollar or less . When a wealthy philanthropist , not a resident of the district , offered to make a substantial donation , it was politely but firmly refused . The people of this area wanted the playground to be their own project . To be sure , tension still remains , and eradicating it will be a long , hard job , requiring many types of approach . Nevertheless , a sound beginning . has been made . This incident illustrates one very important attack upon the problem of anti-Semitism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this series of articles . I have shown that hatred based on race , religion or culture is a serious matter in the United States today , that it operates in many ways and at many levels in the community . It is reassuring to know that this whole problem is at present being attacked more intelligently and more vigorously than ever before , using the tools of modern science to determine what makes people prejudiced , and how this evil can best be eradicated . Three suggestions . What follows is chiefly a summary of the views on practical procedure of such leading experts as Will Maslow of the American Jewish Congress , Abraham Citron , Dr. Isidor Chein and Dr. Max Wolff of the Commission on Community Interrelations of the AJC , Arnold Forster of the Anti-Defamation League and Dr. L. M , Birkhead of the Friends of Democracy , to name only a few . ( None of these experts , of course , necessarily agrees with all the statements below . ) First , it is of the greatest importance that we should keep our whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insecurity and apprehension . BER 29 , 1947 *Second , prejudice must be fought at all levels , in all aspects , and in many ways , simultaneously . Third , when we come to specific areas of activity , there arc some phases of the problem which can be attacked directly and boldly . Most important of all is education , to counteract the various types of prejudice which the child picks up , almost unconsciously , from his parents , in his school and from his playmates . Everything possible should be done to teach the truths which scientists have demonstrated in their laboratories in recent decades : that there are no inherited cultural characteristics , that all groups have the same potentialities , that ? variations ? such as high or low intelligence ? exist in all groups , that every human being is a product of his personal heredity and of his personal environment in the formative years . Publicity , too . The next important field is that of law and social action . Every effort should he made to remove discrimination under existing law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be made to pass laws forbidding discrimination which arises from tolerated social custom . Other states should follow the example of the few which now have laws against discrimination in employment , public entertainment , advertising , etc. , and a federal law of the same character is desirable . Colleges should be legally compelled to abolish the selection of students on an arbitrary basis of race , religion or cultural background . As an immediate step , pending the passage of such laws , public money should be withheld from all educational institutions practising discrimination . Tax exemption on their property should be canceled . Gifts to such institutions should no longer be tax-exempt . The professional spreaders of prejudice , the salesmen of hate , whose activities I described earlier in this series , can be checkmated in several ways . Morris Ernst has proposed that all groups which attempt to influence public opinion should he required by law to disclose the pertinent ? facts about themselves through systematic registration procedures , which would include the names and addresses of all who contribute money to their support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these ultra-nationalist supporters of anti-Semitism and other types of prejudice are receiving large contributions from wealthy men and women whose support would be stopped if news of what they arc doing were made public . Less secrecy . A great part of the vicious propaganda now being circulated is anonymous . The situation would be enormously bettered if anyone who distributes more than a few copies of any public statement Ernst suggests 250 as the limit - were required by law to put on every piece of such material the name and address of the person or group responsible . Legislation to this effect would he a logical extension of the law which now requires all newspapers and other periodicals to publish twice a year the name and addresses of all individuals owning more than one percent of their assets . Some of the foregoing suggestions are embodied in the report of President Truman 's Committee on Civil Rights , published/ in October , 1947 . The committee recommends : C. Laws forbidding all types of dis-crimination ; C. The prohibition , in particular , of discrimination in employment in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or private , which receive federal aid ; C. The abolition of discrimination in the schools and colleges ; C. Statutes against restrictive covenants in housing . The committee recognizes of course that laws are not enough and that we also need public education . It suggests a long-term campaign of this sort . The members of the President 's committee also recognize that , at this moment , some of their recommenda 23 tions are counsels of perfection . It will take a long , hIrd fight , for example , to get Southerners in Congress to accept some of the proposals . Nevertheless , the report of the committee can be of tremendous importance . Because the authors did not compromise with opportunism , did not confine their recommendations to what is possible this year or next , their report will remain a guiding star for the enemies of discrimination for a long time to come . Returning now to the view of the private experts in this field : They emphasize heavily the point that while we must work at every possible level and in every possible way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass roots . Since nearly all minority prejudice , as anti-Semitism , exists to a greater or less extent on an emotional level , and is resistant to rational and logical argument alone , it is important to utilize an attack that is also at the emotional level and demonstrates by concrete action that all groups can work together for a common cause . Effective technique . Whenever someone makes a remark derogatory to a minority group and it is not answered , careful tests have shown that at least one bystander in six has his prejudice increased . Yet if someone else who is present speaks up promptly , is unemotional and reasonable , and appeals to historic American democratic principles ' and a sense of fair play , the bad effect is offset . An ambitious plan is now under way to train leaders in the task of combating anti-minority prejudice and practices , through trade unions , cooperatives , clubs and other groups of all types . These potential leaders are taught how to make a definite factual study of their community , or a part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate the amount of discriminatibn existing there . They are shown how to develop charts and graphs which closely indicate , for example , the difference in wages and chance for advancement which exists between minority and majority-group members of equal educational and professional preparation . This difference constitutes an " index of discrimination . " Interested individuals are shown what to do and what to avoid in attempting to reduce discrimination Of special importance is the fact that , in such cases , action follows upon research ; indeed , action and research can often be combined in a single community project . The information that has been collected is not , as is so often the case with research studies , allowed to gather dust on the shelves , unread and ignored . ( Anyone interested in obtaining further details of this work should write to the Conn-mission on Community Interrelations of the American Jewish Congress , 212 West Fiftieth Street , New York 19 . ) Discussion works . The fact that there are fed prosecntions under laws against discrimination does not necessarily mean that the laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against Discrimination , established by a recent state law , has changed the attitude of many hundreds of employers by private discussion with them , reinforced by quietly pointing out that discrimination is illegal and can be the cause of a fine or imprisonment . Undoubtedly , in thousands of other cases , employers have modified their practices , without saying anything to anyone about it , since the new law came into force . Members of minorities who are seeking employment have had their morale increased to an unmeasurable but certainly tremendous degree by the realization that now , when they are denied employment on arbitrary grounds of race , religion or national origin , they are no longer completely helpless as was once the case . Now they can " do something about it . " " Stand up , you ! " It is also of the greatest importance that leaders of the community , people whose personal prestige is high with all sorts of groups , should " stand up and be counted " against prejudice of every sort . As Carey McWilliams has recently pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination ? or still worse , if they actually condone it ? they give moral support to multitudes of little people who translate their prejudice into concrete action in the fields of employment , education , recreation and housing . What we need , in plain English , is a lot of distinguished people who have guts enough to speak out , and to keep on speaking out , against this evil . Thurman Arnold , former Assistant Attorney General of the US and an outstanding lawyer , , was invited not long ago to join a golf club near Washington , D. C. , where he is now practising . Sitting in the office of the club secretary , he wrote out a check for his initiation and first year 's dues . Then he happened to notice on the secretary 's desk a document about the club which contained the fatal words , " Gentiles only . " " Is that statement correct ? " asked Arnold . " Yes , sir , it is , " said the secretary . " That 's all I need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had just written , tossed the pieces on the secretary 's desk and walked out . Dorothy Thompson , the widely known columnist and speaker , was at a dinner party several years ago where the conversation took an anti-Semitic turn . She listened for about half an hour to talk in which " the Jews " were blamed for everything that was out of sorts in the world . From consideration for her hostess , she stood it as long as she could , but finally she got up and said : " I 've seen too much of the horrible results of this sort of thing and am leaving this place immediately . " And she did . Word soon got around among hostesses that here was one person who practices what she preaches . She is just as popular a dinner guest as she ever was ? which is very popular indeed-=but people no longer tell stories about Jews or other minority groups in her presence . Another story . President Truman 's Committee on Civil Rights , whose chairman was Charles E. Wilson of General Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , The committee contained two Negro members , As the discussions continued , members of the committee began to realize more keenly than ever that the national capital itself practises segregation of Negroes . It occurred to the committeemen that it might be interesting and useful to try a little experiment in breaking down the bars . Purple waiter . One day at lunch hour the entire committee went over to a fashionable and exclusive hotel , and marched to the door of the main dining , room . One of the white members spoke quietly to the bead waiter . " I want a table for my party of 15 , " he said , indicating with a gesture his group , which , of course , Included the two Negro members . The head waiter turned several shades of purple , but he knew when he was licked ; at least half the members of the committee were the sort of people known by sight to every hotel employee in Washington . " Yes , sir , " he said meekly . The committee lunched together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that day , but on many subsequent days . And after that first time , there was not even a flicker of hesitation about giving them seats . Washington hotels , of course , not only refuse Negro guests dining-room privileges , but bedrooms . One day , one of the white members of the committee called up the manager of another popular and fashionable hotel , a man known to him personally . " Two friends of mine are in need of rooms for tonight , " he said . " I hope you can accommodate them . They are Negroes . " " Yes , sir , " said the manager . And that was that . From then on , the two Negro members stayed at that hotel whenever they were in Washington . Leadership . William H. Harrison , vice-president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , held an important post in Washington during the war , in charge of a large body of civilian employees in the Signal Corps . One day , an additional worker was needed and , according to the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CSC sent over a Negro . Within an hour , a delegation horn the white workers came into Harrison 's office . " You have just hired a Negro to work in this division , " they said . " If you do n't fire him instantly , all of us white workers will quit as of today . " Harrison looked at them thoughtfully for a long minute before he spoke . " Is that all ? " he asked . " Do n't you understand ? " continued the spokesman . " We are all going to quit . " " I heard you , " said Harrison , - Our new employee ? who happens to be a Negro -- -is going to have a fair try at this job . I expect each of you to help , and I suggest that you go back to work . Is there anything else ? " The members of the delegation looked at each other silently for a moment , and then heat a retreat . They were all hack at work the following morning . From then on , Negroes -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were fired , too , but for proved incompetence , and not because of the color of their skin . If we had a couple of hundred outstanding Americans who believed in civil liberties as do those I have quoted , we might well have an Archimedes lever which would move the world . " I 'm ashamed . " But you do n't have to be a big shot in order to stand up and speak when somebody indulges in prejudiced talk . On a crowded Fifth Avenue bus in New York City , not long ago , a woman passenger observed loudly that " all these Jews " are " crowding the buses , and it 's an outrage . " A fellow passenger , a man , spoke up , in a calm and dignified way . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , " he said , " for such false and un-American talk . " Whereupon another woman added her voice : " I agree with him . Fm a Christian , but it makes me ashamed to hear talk of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the war , this problem of emotional prejudice arose in many war plants when members of minorities , such as Negroes , were introduced to work alongside of biased whites . In a big St. Louis plant , for example , most of the workers were poor whites from the South , with strong anti-Negro attitudes ; when a few Negro workers were hired , they threatened to strike . They were called together in groups and were talked to by a high official of the US Army , who pointed out that their work in the plant was just as necessary as that of soldiers in the front lines and that if they left their jobs for any reason , they would betray their fighting men and their country . It worked . Intolerance needed ! Experts are convinced that much actual discrimination and a great deal of the verbal expression of prejudice are practised merely because they have a passive cultural momentum . They are supported by the flimsy grounds of past practice . Much conversational bigotry , for example , is casual , indulged in merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When citizens challenge these customs in an intelligent and determined way , the practices simply collapse . What is needed is a complete and decisive abandonment , by more and more Americans , of old habits of passive acceptance of bigotry . We must develop active , vigorous intolerance ? intolerance for the expression of prejudice . I hope I do n't need to emphasize again that only in a sound and healthy society , dedicated to peace and prosperity , can we maintain conditions which give real hope of finally ending this tragic evil of discrimination . As international hostility mounts toward hysteria and pushes the nation into wartime totalitarianism , frustrated aggressions express themselves in attacks upon minorities . When depression grips the land , and there are a dozen ? or a hundred ? applicants for every job , the anti-Semite , the Negro hater , the opponent of those of Mexican or Oriental blood , has a field day . We must learn , however painful and disturbing the lesson may be to many of our financial , industrial and political rulers , to keep our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other nations of the world .
