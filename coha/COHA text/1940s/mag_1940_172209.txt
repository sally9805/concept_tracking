&gt; Who will wham the most home runs-Joe Di Maggio , Jimmy Foxx , Hank Greenberg or Ted Williams ? <P> &gt; Who will prove to be the No.1 rookie of the year-Giant Johnny Rucker , Yankee Marvin Breuer , Red Mike McCormick or Dodger Peewee Reese ? <P> &gt; Can begoggled little Dominic Di Maggio , purchased from the San Francisco Seals for $75,000 , do for the Red Sox what Brother Joe has done for the Yankees ? <P> &gt; Will the Pirates go places under their new manager , fiery Frankie Frisch , who led the Cardinals to a world championship in 1934 ? <P> &gt; Will the bat-mighty Cardinals or the pitch-mighty Reds win the National League pennant ? <P> &gt; Can the Red Sox or the Indians prevent the World Champion Yankees from winning the American League pennant for the fifth year in a row ? <P> These problems momentarily supplanted the world 's more serious perplexities for 200,000 U. S. citizens who last week crammed into eight major-league ball parks to salute the opening of the 1940 baseball season . In Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 30,000 equally earnest baseball fans , tossed the first ball , then settled back to watch the opening day 's headliner : Washington Senators v. Boston Red Sox . <P> On the mound for Boston was diamond-wise Robert Moses ( " Ole Mose " ) Grove , No. 1 Red Sox pitcher despite his 40 years . With masterful control and rare cunning , resorted to when the blaze died out of his famed fireball five years ago , Ole Mose confounded Washington batters . Up they came and down they went . By the eighth inning , no Senator had even got to first base on a walk . Then , after retiring 21 batters in a row-with a no-hit , no-run game almost in the palm of his glove-Grove faltered . One hit was chalked up against him , then another . Regaining control in time 's nick , Ole Mose blasted his way out , wound up with a two-hit shutout ( 1-to-0 ) - as spectacular a game as any of the 287 he has won in 15 brilliant years of big-league baseball . <P> In baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down as the best performance of 1940 's opening day , were it not for a dimple-chinned kid young enough to be his son : 21-year-old Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians . Like Grove , Feller is his team 's No. 1 pitcher and was therefore assigned to start the Indians ' opener , against the White Sox in Chicago 's Comiskey Park . <P> Among his audience there was no President , but , in a box near home plate , were three spectators young Feller was just as anxious to please : his parents and his kid sister Marguerite , who had gone to Chicago from their farm in Van Meter , Iowa . Ma Feller in years gone by had often " cried her eyes out " because little Bob and his father used to spend so much time behind the barn playing ball . Last week , when the last White Sox batter had been put out , Ma Feller was in tears again , but for a different reason . <P> Young Bob , with the poise and savvy of a seasoned oldtimer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-to-0 ) -a feat that had not been accomplished in a big-league park since 1938 and had never before in the history of major-league baseball been accomplished on an opening day .
