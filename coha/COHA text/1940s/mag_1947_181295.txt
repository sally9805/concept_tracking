In an endless column , several hundred taxis churred past the gleaming Montevideo office building that houses the U.S. Embassy . No others ( except for emergency calls ) were on the streets . In this reproachful fashion , Monte cabbies protested last week against the beating of a fellow driver by U.S. sailors . <P> Chauffeur Teodoro Prez was the complainant . During last month 's inauguration of President Toms Berreta , he picked up three U.S. bluejackets from the good-will U.S. naval squadron led by the cruiser Fresno . The sailormen slugged him and robbed him . <P> Sailors ' scuffles are a familiar story in many a port , and in Latin America they have often helped feed anti-U.S . feeling . The Prez story was another case of a friendly visit marred by hoodlums in uniform . Said a Monte sidewalk philosopher : " It 's a pity these sailors should have picked on Uruguay , the only country in South America that really likes the U.S. "                 @ @ @ @
