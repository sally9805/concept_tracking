&gt;U.S. synthetic rubber supplies may be stretched from two to five times by generous admixture of lignin , a gummy byproduct of the paper industry . <P> &gt;U.S. plastics supplies can probably be doubled by adding lignin-and though plastics have been tiresomely fanfared as coming wartime substitutes for metals in civilian goods , engineers last week confessed that plastics are as scarce as metals , will go almost exclusively into armaments . <P> &gt;In the last 30 days , use of lignin-itself a plastic as well as a plastic " extender " - has increased fourfold in making airplane pattern plates . <P> This is the latest chapter in the utilization of lignin-the greatest industrial-waste on earth . In time , chemists believe , it will spawn as many useful derivatives as coal tar and become the basis of a great chemical industry . But so far , in spite of 40 years of head-scratching and an increasing number of derivatives , chemists have found uses for less than .05% of the 3,000,000 tons of lignin available each year in the U.S. and Canada . Yet lignin production goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulp before the pulp is made into good sulfite papers . <P> Lignin is a dark , resinous substance lying like mortar among the cellulose-walled cells of all plants . It makes wood woody , constitutes about 25% ( by weight ) of the coniferous trees from which most paper is made . From the vats of U.S. mills every day are drained some 12,000,000 gallons of lignin waste . Papermen find it harder to get rid of than old razor blades . It is often poured into streams-a practice now forbidden in some States because the lignin absorbs free oxygen from the water , asphyxiates fish . Where stream pollution is forbidden , lignin wastes are now bothersomely and expensively dehydrated and burned-except at a few enterprising U.S. mills . <P> Marathon Strides . Highly enterprising is Marathon Paper Mills of Rothschild , Wis. , makers of food containers and chemicals . In 1927 Marathon summoned Chemical Engineer Guy C. Howard , gave him a platoon of Ph.D.s and the job of finding more profitable channels for waste lignin than the Wisconsin River . Today , after 15 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste liquors , precipitates out calcium lignin sulfonate , turns it into : <P> &gt;Vanillin , the flavor constituent of vanilla . Last year one-half of U.S. vanillin was synthesized from U.S. lignin , consumed by General Foods , Hershey , National Biscuit , countless numbers of ice-cream makers , the Army &; Navy . <P> &gt;Tanning chemicals more efficient than traditional tanbarks , which are increasingly scarce as U.S. imports are cut off and blighted U.S. chestnut trees ( a major source ) are becoming extinct . <P> &gt;Agents which disperse cement more efficiently through sand , gravel , water . <P> &gt;Water-softening agents , widely used in U.S. locomotives .
