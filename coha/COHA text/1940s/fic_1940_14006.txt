An abandoned rejectory in a war-torn country . Bare stone walls and floor . A statue of the Madonna occupies a niche in the centre of the back wall . Below it is a long table . Two tall narrow deep-set windows  --  one on each side of the room . The reddish light of early morning streams through these windows : the two beams cross diagonally below the statue . At the table sit five officers . They are holding court-martial . Outside , there are sounds of far-off guns ; occasional near-by shots ; faint bugle-calls , marching soldiers , cries and shouts of people . Muffled , of course , by the stone walls . A young soldier stands before the tribunal . He has just heard sentence pronounced upon him . RIVAS Take him away ! rapping on table.Next ! YOUNG SOLDIER crying out in protest.Do n't shoot me ! No , no GUARD dragging him out.Come along ! YOUNG SOLDIER I did n't know he was a spy  --  he spoke so kind . No !

KENT sympathetically.Is it necessary that I believe ? MORENO If you were only of my faith ! KENT What difference does that make ? p. 19 MORENO I 'd like you to understand  --  it would be easier KENT It 's a poet 's business to understand MORENO You are a poet ? KENT Two volumes . MORENO You look but twenty-three . KENT Twenty-four . MORENO A poet in this bloody business ? KENT Why not ? We dream a truth:But what is truth  --  if not action , too ? MORENO Unkind truthto lead you into action here ! KENT To fight  --  for freedom:The good old cause . It 's in my blood:the love of it  --  faith in it.

MORENO My own case ! p. 20 KENT Suddenly you discover there are thingsworth dying for  --  ideas  --  you have to die for ! MORENO Though the causeI die for may not be yours !  --  It 's easier now to tell my story . KENT Well ? MORENO You said : ' Seeds sown in childhood '  --  that 's where I 'll begin  --  this strange end I 've come to is rooted there : I see it now : in those early years.Freedom was your food and drink , you say.I was nurtured  --  steeped  --  in our religion.Yes  --  that was my food and drink.I dreamed that I should be a priest:give myself completely to the church.My father died . Then I knew that I must workinstead : after school was overlearn a trade or keep a shop:insure my mother 's living.It was she who taught me  --  faith and reverence . pause . KENT Yes ? MORENO I had a sudden thought:if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sands of my life running out  --  with only an hour of it left ? pause.Perhaps . But she was goodand I was happy . More than all the saintsshe loved Madonna . I remember that.She had me kneel beside her when she prayedand I came to love her , too  --  that tall , radiant other-Motherstanding in the niche . I talked to her , even as my mother did  --  and thought she talked to me.She always granted what I asked.I adored her face  --  her image  --  the one with the blue cape:it seemed to float out from her  --  as if she were walking toward me , against a bright blowing wind . You 'll see why I tell you this in just a moment Adolescent years were tumultuous enough  --  and early manhood : I was caughtin many conflicts : ambitions , desires , passions  --  and I forgot  --  finding my way  --  you know how it is  --  untilI hit upon mechanics  --  flying  --  had a talent for it . After that , came Dorotea  --  marriage  --  and I settled down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling in  --  I joined , of course:took my orders as they came  --  bombed town after town : the new techniqueI gloried in it p. 21 KENT in a low voice.No ! MORENO Yes . I did.Won medal after medal . Each town destroyed , left desolate , every building smashed , meant triumph , victory for our side.I even gloated to see the people run ; days when I dived low enough to see.They fell like tenpins  --  yes  --  That 's what I thought  --  tenpins ! A devil knows a kind of joy.I knew that joy : to see the dust rise froma row of homes , houses blown to bits , factories a-flame  --  perhaps a school . KENT a low groan.Oh ! MORENO Wait ! Do n't hate me yet ! But that 's the truth . I sayI knew the power of Satan:his wild , blood-curdling power ! I must tell you all  --  Or you 'll never understand what happened next . KENT Go on . MORENO One night , word reached me from my wife : Pepita  --  our little girl  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for leave . Just a day . A night.I sought a church . I entered  --  stumbled:The mis-step jarred my glory into dust  --  Or else it was frayed nerves  --  just plain fatigue:For suddenly I was weary of the dog-fights andincessant roar  --  Oh ! ghastly weary  --  sick unto death of Satan and his thrills ! But  --  to lose that golden child ! It seemed , just then , more than I could bear ! I sank down on the floor before Our Lady:As I knelt there , all my childhod 's faithrose up within me like a flood  --  a white , silver flood  --  I was immersed  --  There she stood , Madonna !  --  her image was the same:the very same I used to talk to , love and worship.Yes , and there was the cape , the blue cape , floating , blowing in the wind . I implored her to save our child:Pepita , with the curls and great eyesand dancing feet then I waited Surely , in a moment , I would hear Madonna say , as in the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A faint sound of organ music heard off-stage.I waited long  --  with eyes tight-closed  --  listening for that word . Then , I heard a sound:at first I thought it was an organ-notewandering through the arches overhead But no ! It was her voice  --  far-off  --  and tremulous with grieving : " Intercede for your child ? Lo  --  what have you done with mine ? " Startled , I raised my head and looked into her face.It was alive , as ever was my mother's.Pale and serene , as before  --  but different : More sorrowful than my memory could recall.Was I living on that fatal daywhen she first beheld her Son upon the Cross ? No  --  this was some fresh agonythat had left its imprint on her brow.Before I recovered from the stab of seeing this , she spoke again : " Come with me , " I heard her say , in the summoning tones of twilight chimes , " and look upon what I shall show you.Then return and pray  --  ask once morethat I spare Pepita 's life . " She stepped down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say all the legends.But that she should step down for me  --  a simple airman praying for his child:that was the miracle ! " Come , " she said  --  and moved in majesty down the aisle . I followed  --  staggered after  --  out the great carved doors  --  into the square  --  through the streets . We passed in and outof noisy crowds . Sometimes I almost lost her:then I would catch sight of the blue capeblowing in the wind : run fast:overtake her . That blue cape ! As it moved and floated on the air  --  it sent forth a fragrance:like a breath of heaven ! It was peace  --  I longed to wrap it round meforever and forever ! I feel its healing now  --  just to speak of it to you ! Presto !  --  as in a fairy tale  --  the street ran across an enemy town . We were in the market place.It was morning , ten by the clock.The square was jammed  --  mostly women.I could hear them talking:some had children by the hand:others kept a watchful eyeon the older ones at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? p. 22 KENT with quiet intensity.No . At Flanders , my father said , soldiers often told him they saw the Christ.He walked across the fields among the fallenon many a moonlight night.Where women are  --  Why should not Madonna walk ? MORENO Just so . I kept close and listened . A babel of voices and sounds heard off stage  --  more or less veiled as of a scene recollected : tooting of cars , braying of donkeys , bits of song , cheery calls , shouting of wares , laughter and cries of children , the talk of women . " Carrots this morning . Beets , too . " " Where 's the oranges ? " " Gone to pay for tanks and seed . " " My son came home last night . An arm gone . " " Lucky you have him at all . Mine was killed . " " Too bad too bad " " Bread not so good  --  getting scarce " " No matter  --  we 'll make it do " " Rosalie 's going to have a baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But she 's glad ! Reminds her of Silva ! " " Adolfo ! Come here ! A raid 's likely " " Five thousand invaders landed yesterday ! " " So-so ? We 'll drive them out yet ! " " Sure we will !

Quick  --  the subways ! The cellars ! Run  --  run ! Children  --  children ! " " Blackbirds  --  monstrous Blackbirds ! " p. 23 MORENO " Look , Felipe ! "  --  Madonna whispered , " There are you in the first plane leading  --  " I swearI seemed to be standing by her sidein the midst of scurrying frightened women , yet  --  when she said that  --  I saw myself  --  I was myselfstrapped in that plane high overhead ! It was as if I had left my body  --  a chrysalis from which I had escaped  --  and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this hand in that stray sunbeam  --  lean out to look below  --  to get the range:I saw the cold and gloating triumphon my facethe crowd of women in the square  --  another chance to terrorize and kill , perhaps surrender of the town  --  if I could but kill the lot ! I said between my teeth I should have asked younot to hate me  --  when I began ! KENT I 'm listening  --  not hating MORENO I saw , I felt , my hand release the lever:the eggs of death dropped down  --  and then  --  my feet upon the solid earth  --  even as I heard my plane zoom off  --  I stood among my victims:their screams were in my ears  --  women , children  --  old men  --  mangled , wounded " Look ! "  --  Our Lady said:and there at my feet was a tiny girl:with curls like my Pepita 's  --  so like  --  I gasped with horror and would have fled:But Madonna laid her hand upon my arm : " Who killed her ? " she asked  --  " I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own child ! " Across the square were others , silent , bleeding  --  and they all looked like my Pepita ! " But the mothers  --  See ! " And Madonna turned my gaze upon a tangleof skirts and feet and arms  --  women  --  dead . " Mothers like me , " she breathed  --  and spread her arms above them , love and pity streaming from her eyes . " It was my Son who gave the worldthis truth , " she communed aloud  --  and the sound was as if the windhad softly brushed the organ keys  --  " Inasmuch as ye do it unto the leastof these  --  ye do it unto Me . " " Come , " she led  --  I followed  --  We stepped within a schoolhouse.The teacher was at the blackboard Murmur and hum of children 's voices are heard off stage  --  as in a school room.Teacher .

The scene faded  --  became a hospital  --  a row of boys and girlstaking the air upon the porches.Then another city  --  another  --  and I always circling in the sky above  --  a bird of prey  --  a hawk of death  --  the cities telescoped  --  it was allone mad confusion  --  fleeing men and women  --  fire  --  death and terror  --  terror now for me as well I could bear no more only cry outin my frenzy : " Save them Madonna save them ! " I reached to grasp her cloak.It slipped between my fingers  --  and she was gone ! I was left alone to endure the agony  --  the agony I myself had made.I think I fainted.Certainly I swooned into a blackness:purgatory could not be blacker . I fell and fell through space . and struck at last a hardness:A floor beneath me : I was safe  --  within the shelter of the church . Madonna was standing quietlyupon her pedestal  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sure knowledge that she had led me all that night . " Will you pray me now to save your child ?

All went dark and blank as before Until a hand shook and shook my shoulder.The touch was rough  --  not gentle like Our Lady's.It was the Sergeant.He stood there with an order  --  and a telegram.I seized them both  --  tore at the telegram.It was from my wife.Pepita had died in the early morning . p. 26 KENT after a pause.I 'm sorry . MORENO What else could I expect ? That Life should run to meet mewhen I had so lavishly seeded Death ?
