Corporations wawa tie permute ( ' to amortize plant expansion cost over a five-year period , at an annual amortization rate of 20 per cent . The subcommittee agreed to put under one title the amortization plan , the excess profits tax and a repeal of the profit limitation set-up under the Vinson-Trammel act . Speedy enactment of the excess profits tax measure had been promised by Congressional leaders , President Roosevelt said at his press conference today . As a result of assurances of passage , he added , industry was assembling materials in anticipation of defense contracts , so that the whole program would be greatly speeded . In explaining the subcommittee 's action , its chairman , Representative Jere Cooper of Tennessee , said that the group would meet again Monday for further consideration of the rate and base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction as to when the bill could be brought before the House , but said that his subcommittee was laboring long and hard to get the measure in proper form for consideration . After explaining that the subcommittee would recommend to the full committee the incorporation of the three items under one title , Mr. Cooper said : " We also tentatively agreed to recommend to the full committee that amortization be allowed for a period of five years on new plants , plant expansions and equipment if it is certified by the National Defense Advisory Commission cr the War or Navy Departments after July 10 , 1940 , which was the , date of the statement by the White House that such an amortization was agreed upon for national defense . " An emergency facility is to be defined as any land , building , machinery , or equipment or part thereof , the construction , reconstruction , erection or installation of which was completed after July 10 , 1940 , or which was acquired after // FOR AMORTIZATION ON DEFENSE PLANTS // such date and with respect to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If a corporation erects a new plant or extends an existing plant , and the certificate is issued for such facility , the corporation may amortize the cost of that property over a period of five years , which means it may take 20 per cent in amortization each year . It could deduct this much from all taxes on income and excess profits . The corporation is required to take 20 per cent depreciation allowance , neither more nor less . Choice of Bases Is Allowed " We will also recommend that a corporation may continue on a depreciation basis instead of an amortization basis if it desires to do so . Even after it elects to take the amortization basis it can change back to the depreciation basis by giving proper notice , but it can not thereafter return to the amortization basis . " Speaking in reply to questions about conferences which he held this week with Chairman Doughton of the House Ways and Means Committee and Chairman Harrison of the Senate Finance Committee , President Roosevelt said that Senator Harrison had reported the Congress to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . At the same time Senator Harrison reported that the Congress would like to clear away questions relating to amortization allowances for plants being erected to expedite the defense program . Mr. Roosevelt commended industry generally for going ahead on the defense program and trusting the government to work out acceptable agreements . Some builders , he added , had rushed preliminary work on programs even where lack of legislation had made it impossible for contracts to be signed . Two Tax Plans Proposed By The Associated Press . WASHINGTON , Aug. 2 ? While the plan to encourage industry to expand plants for defense purposes was being tentatively approved today by the House tax subcommittee , its members had before them at least two plans for an excess profits tax . One , proposed by Treasury tax experts , would give corporations a flat $5,000 exemption in figuring the tax , plus a non-taxable credit determined by applying average earnings over a base period-1936 to 1939 , inclusive  --  to currently invested capital . Under this application , a corporation would be allowed a credit amounting to snot less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , plus 4 per cent of the remainder of invested capital . The maximum credit would be 10 per cent of invested capital . New corporations would be allowed a credit of 10 per cent of the first $500,000 of invested capital and 8 per cent of the remainder . An example of the way this credit system would work was given in th case of a concern with $1,000 , - 000 currently invested which has earned $80,000 , or 8 per cent annually , on an average over the four-year base period . Since its average earnings are more than 6 per cent and less than 10 per cent it would be allowed a credit equal to its average earnings ? $80,000 ? plus the $5,000 flat exemption or a total of $85,000 . If its average earnings had been $40,000 , or 4 per cent of invested capital , its credit would amount to 6 per cent of the first $500,000 of invested capital , or $30,000 ; plus 4 per cent of the remainder , or $20,000 ; plus the $5,000 flat exemption . Suggested Rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent on income up to 15 per cent of invested capital , minus the credit . A 40 per cent rate would be levied on income between 15 and 30 per cent of invested capital and 50 per cent on that above 30 per cent . In defining invested capital , the Treasury plan would count borrowed capital as invested capital provided the concern 's total of all capital did not exceed $100.000 If the total of the concern 's equity capital ( common and preferred stock , surplus and undivided profit ) and its borrowed capital exceeded $100,000 but was less than $1,000,000 , it could count 66 2-3 per cent of the amount borrowed as invested capital . A counter-plan proposed by the Joint Congressional Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation would levy a 40 per cent tax on taxable excess profits and would offer a concern organized prior to Jan. 1 , 1940 , two alternatives as to figuring their deductions : 1 . A specific exemption of $5,000 plus the average net income for the base period increased by 8 per cent of the new capital paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the taxable year . 2 . A specific exemption of $5,000 plus 5 per cent of the first $500,000 of invested capital , 4 per cent of the next $500,000 of invested capital , 3 per cent of the next $1,000,000 of invested capital and 2 per cent of the capital invested over $2,000,000 . To corporations organized after Jan. 1 , 1940. would be allowed a flat $5,000 plus 8 per cent of the invested capital as of the taxable year .
