Pastor Norman Vincent Peale of Manhattan 's august Marble Collegiate Reformed Church went to Hollywood as technical adviser for Warner Brothers ' clerical production One Foot In Heaven . Returned to his cure , Pastor Peale 's chief criticism of the industry was its penchant for putting too many drinking scenes in pictures . Other observations : <P> Hollywood is a " very quiet , sleepy little town , and you need a spyglass to see anyone on the streets after midnight . Motion-picture people are wholesome , friendly and home-loving folks . Those people have n't time to be wild because in Hollywood it 's work , work , work all the time . Hollywood has one foot in heaven . . . . "
