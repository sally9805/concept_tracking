txt LONDON , May ** the great air battles now being fought over enemy territory almost every day and night , more than half a million men are engaged on both sides . This pre-invasion battering of the Luftwaffe and Nazi communications far behind the outer ramparts of Hitler 's Fortress Europe has already placed a terrific burden upon the RAF and the United States Strategic Air Force in Europe , but the climax has not  --  yet been reached . That will come only when D-Day arrives . From that time on , General Eisenhower has said he will call upon the men of the air force who have been doing nearly all the fighting in this theatre since Dunkerque to make one last , great , superhuman effort to insure success of the amphibious operations . In 1940 , when Hitler was experimenting with a plan to defeat Britain without invasion , the Luftwaffe dropped 40,000 tons of bombs upon this country . Last month the RAF and American Air Forces dropped about 80,000 tons of bombs on Germany . These figures are striking enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that in one of the so-called big air raids of the last war twelve planes had to make two trips each to drop 3,000 pounds on the target . Now it is not uncommon for the RAF to drop 4,500 tons of high explosive , and 250,000 incendiaries to boot , in a single night . Results of the Offensive In April the United States Air Forces fought twenty-three major battles in daylight in the air over enemy territory . The RAF in , the same period attacked Germany by night fifteen times . So far as the weather permits , the offensive will continue with mounting ferocity this month . Its aim is to destroy the Luftwaffe 's fighter strength , reduce the enemy industrial potential , tangle his rail communications to the front , and destroy at last his strategic reserve of war material at key defense centers . It is longrange artillery preparation for the assault on the Nazi fortifications . It is more for the plane provides a means for waging war far behind the enemy 's front line . That the air offensive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has reduced German war strength by 25 to 30 per cent already . But such figures are at best only a scientific guess . Whether airpower can achieve all results its advocates claim for it can only be determined when the Wehrmacht finally cracks and nazism collapses . But an effort on so large a scale can not be maintained without affecting Allied economy and manpower . The manufacture of aircraft to create the growing frontline strength and reserve has become a major industry both here and in the United States . Millions of men and vast quantities of material which in old-fashioned wars would have gone to the Army and Navy are used now in the struggle to achieve mastery of the air over the enemy in Europe and in the Pacific to replace losses due to battle attrition . That was the choice that had to be made early in the war . The die was cast and now it is too late to change even if it were desirable . Germany entered the war boasting of a front-line air strength of 24,000 combat planes and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard struggle to overcome that lead . But long before either Britain or the United States had planes enough to do the job they were doing now plans were made for using them . That is why it is possible now to conduct an air of- ' fensive on a scale that three years I ago , even two years ago , would have seemed impossible . Main- I tenance , repair , replacements of men and machines , traffic control and all the other myriad details involved in large-scale air attack were worked out for the many operating now by the few who blazed the trail in 1940 and 1941 . Speeding Up the Attack The growth of the air forces and the weight of the attack they can deliver have grown so steadily . ' that the public is hardly aware the distance that has been traveled . There is no statistical substitute for first-hand experience of air attack . But some comparisons may help . In one of the first RAF attacks of this war thirty Whitleys and twenty Hampdeni dropped forty 500-pound bombs and eighty-four 2,000-pound bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hours to do it . Now the RAF cascades several hundred tons of bombs on a target in less than an hour . Twelve days ' operation by the RAF and the United States Air Forces based on this island now consume about the same amount of high-octane gas as the RAF used in the whole year of 1940 When the Battle of Britain was fought . Only a year ago Lieut . Gen. Ira C. Eaker expressed the opinion that an air force which fought ten major engagements in a month was operating at a high level of efficiency . The United States Air Forces , now considerably bigger than the RAF , have more than doubled this figure recently and the RAF has bettered it by 50 per cent . But every time 2,000 bombers are sent against the enemy *from 12,000 to 20,000 fighting men of Britain or the United States are in action against the enemy , It takes pretty close to ten divisions of men ion the ground to keep them flying . Some 500,000 Germans at anti-aircraft guns and as many as 1,000 German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , which is n't always any more . Every time 2,000 planes come back there are 8,000 engines to be overhauled and checked , more than 15,000 electrically heated flying suits and oxygen masks to be folded , inspected and repaired . Armorers who fit bombs into bombbays , weather men who decide which of several targets offers the best conditions , telephonists and countless others who play their inconspicuous ' but important parts in the operations all are on duty around the clock . The Work of Five Years This elaborate machine has been built up gradually but steadily since 1939 when the RAF had little more than a plan for the strategic bombing of Germany and United States help had hardly progressed beyond the blueprint stage . A vast network of airfields had to be laid out on this small island which Charles A. Lindbergh held was n't big enough to serve as a base for air fleets the size of those operating from here now . While the machine was building , those who serve as cogs in it were acquiring the skill and experience which enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight only a year ago . But the plan of operation , the strategy of the campaign , has not changed . It is just that now , with more planes , more men and more skill , it is possible to carry on the job on a scale and at a tempo that were impossible before . There are more planes here than have ever been used against the enemy . There is more than one crew for each plane . Intelligence Officers have multiplied to the point where they can work in shifts , planning attacks and interrogating crews after they have come back . Some planes are able to do two missions in a single day , with alternate crews . Some stations have as many as six lead crews  --  that is , crews who have the best navigator , bombardier and pilot . The strain of battle is too great to permit the same crews to fight every day , so this factor is important in maintaining the offensive to take full advantage of the weather when it is good . When the planes come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repair crews . Those which can be made serviceable for next day 's operations are tackled first . Repair crews often go on working all through the night to get them fit for battle when daylight breaks . Others are repaired by crews working in shifts . One factor that has made possible operations on the present large scale , in which RAF and American planes are able to drop 18,000 tons of bombs in a single twenty-four-hour period , was careful advance preparation . Long before the presence of the Ninth Air Force in Britain was ever announced airports were ready for it with huge reserves of fuel and ammunition stored and earmarked . Pressure on men and machines ? on ground crews as well as air crews ? is great already , but the limit has not yet been reached . It will come when General Eisenhower gives orders to step up operations for the invasion , at which time it may be that big as well as medium bombers will be expected to fly two and even three missions a day . It is something of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strain on the air crews has been reduced . Recently American bomber losses have fallen to less than 3 per cent , while fighter losses have been held to just over 1 per cent . Only a year ago 5 per cent losses were considered reasonably light . Has Luftwaffe Reserves ? The reluctance of the Luftwaffe to come up and fight is regarded as a mark of its weakened condition . But there are many who would not be surprised to see Hitler make good the boasts of his propaganda chiefs by producing unexpected reserves when the invasion begins . The only trouble with that theory is that while planes can be built and stored underground , the only place where crews can be trained to fl them is in the air . American and British ? strategists do not place much faith in Hitler 's reserves . Still the Luftwaffe remains a force to be reckoned with , and nobody knows its exact strength . Of one thing , however , American Air Force officials are sure . That is , that the Luftwaffe is weaker now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace losses is less than it was even a few months ago . On March 13 a high officer of the American Air Force said that given thirty to sixty days of clear weather the Luftwaffe could be driven from the skies . Fifty-four days have passed since then , but if the Luftwaffe is still defending Germany the air force spokesman can blame it on the European climate , which from Jan. 1 until the close of the first week in April produced only eleven perfect days suitable for visual bombing . Battering of Germany on the Present Scale Is Result of Years of Toil
