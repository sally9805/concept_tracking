Y. , Dec. ** United States Government made its 146th annual payment of six yards of calico today to each Indian of the Iroquois confederacy , in solemn accordance with the Treaty of Canandaigua , signed Nov. 11 , 1794 . Bolts of bright printed cloth and unprinted muslin were handed to chiefs of the Six Nations in cavernous Tonawanda Community House , set in the snow-flecked hills near Batavia . A low chant filled the great hall , drums thumped a Steady but barely audible beat as Ho-Sta-Oot ( Wall of Rock ) , a Tonawanda Seneca , designated as " caller , " uttered the traditional ; welcome to fellow-chiefs of the Six Nations . " Mohawks , elder brothers , Keepers of the Eastern Door , will not be with us , " he droned . " They did not answer the summons in 1794 . " Oneidas , , Keepers of the Wamptua , " amt .

" Such faith is unique in a world of broken promises and of enslaved peoples , " he said . A murmur washed against the great walls of the long house . Dr. Parker motioned to a driedup little man at his side , Peter Doctor Go-Noh-Da-Gieh ( the War Chief ) , called on him for a prayer . The words came softly , in Seneca , from withered lips . Hidden in deep ' shadow in a remote gallery , an Indian chorus of mixed voices provided even softer background with the , music of O-Kee-Weh , the Iroquois death hymn . Representatives of the office of Indian Affairs in Washington and Charles H.

They entered the darkened room in slow , colorful procession , keeping time to drum throbs and Indian chants . The musicians were the older folk of the confederacy , wrinkled and toothless , but sure of the beat . An ancient written record of the meeting at Canandaigua supplied the material for the text of the reenactment . Counsels Against Signing The cast enacted different stages in the growth and development of an Iroquois , from babyhood to his taking the arms of a warrior . The tribal dances were woven in the scenes and were enriched with the music and hymns of the Six Nations . The lights at last played on the scene depicting the Iroquois at Canandaigua , meeting with Colonel Timothy Pickering and other agents of the new United States of America ; undecided on signing away their rights to the lands in and west of the Ohio Valley . Red Jacket , played by Chief Wall of Iron , counseled against the , treaty . " Brothers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be those agreed upon in the council at Buffalo Creek , " he urged . " They must include the Muskingum line . It is this line , or the Six Nations do not sign . " The actors played their parts with convincing fervor . The warriors and assembled sachems growled approval , the lighting etching their high cheek bones and face paint . Moccasined feet thudded in the broad hall . A messenger , Eagle Feather Dancing , raced down the center aisle . Breathlessly he told Red Jacket that Big Turtle , war chief of the Mianie , had been beaten at Fallen Timber by Mad Anthony Wayne . Red Jacket turned to the sachems around him . " Brothers , this is the end , " he said . " Our cause is lost . We must sign . " Red Jacket Gives Warning One by one the chiefs of the six nations put their marks on the treaty . Red Jacket was last . He signed , then hurled the quill from him . He turned , the strong light full on his face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great waters , " he said . " We are encircled . We are encompassed . Wild spirits ride upon the wind . The waters are disturbed . They rise . They press upon us . The waves settle over us . We vanish . We mingle with the common elements . What marks our extinction ? We disappear forever . " The , hidden choir took up again the melancholy chant of the death song . Dr. Parker closed the ceremony on the fading scene against this background . When the re-enactment ended , Lyman Johnson , Ta-Won-Noys , The Owl , a gaunt and aged Tonawanda , clad in ancient buckskins , rose on the platform . From a cloth wrapper he took a cracked and faded parchment , one of three existing copies of the original treaty . He held it a moment in the light , restored it to the wrapper .. " You see here , for the first time exposed to public view , " said Dr. Parker , " a treaty sacredly kept for 146 years , perhaps the only treaty that has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty for generations . Ta-WonNoys is superstitious about it . He consented to exhibit it only after long debate with members of the council . White folk and Red folk filtered out of Tonawanda Community House . The sun was dying , red in a purling sky . Snowdrifts and road ice were rosy in the light . Peter Doctor , oldest of the Senecas , looked across the hills where the wind made a track through the brown grass . He told of his birth in an Indian cabin in this same spot in October , 1861 . A smile creased his leathery features . " My cabin is in Rochester Museum now , but my mother 's cabin still stands down there , " he said , pointing down into the valley . " My mother was 70 years old when she died . I do not pass her cabin often . It gives a man a funny feeling . " Peter Doctor said he still has a farm , but seldom works it . His kindly features creased in another grin . " The sun farms it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing sun in the clear wintry sky . He said : " Our people were civilized people with a veneer of savagery . Over there white men have turned to savagery with a veneer of civilization . " He waved vaguely to indicate great distance .
