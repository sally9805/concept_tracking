If a man suffering from gallstones went to a textbook of surgery to study his disease , he . would find things like this : " Whereas in cases of simple cholelithiasis cholecystostomy is the operation of choice , in cases of acute calculous cholecystitis cholecystectomy is to be preferred . " In plainer English : In cases of simple gallstones , it is best to remove the stones and leave the gall bladder alone ; but if a patient has an inflamed gall bladder as well as stones , it is wiser to remove both stones and bladder together . <P> Such complex gibberish annoys Surgeon Moses Benmosch of Manhattan 's Mount Sinai Hospital . Surgeon Benmosch believes that patients have more guts when they are told more about them . This week Dr. Benmosch published the first popular primer of surgery : A Surgeon Explains to the Layman ( Simon &; Schuster ; $3 ) . His book is chock-full of bold diagrams , simple descriptions of operations . Dr. Benmosch 's bookside manner is calm and reassuring , should serve as a tonic for healthy-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benmosch , " are rather pretty to look at once they are out - very similar to roughly rounded , uncut , semiprecious stones . . . in various shades of yellow , pink or green with red flecks . . . . Some may be microscopic in size , others as large as a hen 's egg . And a patient may be suffering from just one large gallstone or from a thousand tiny ones . " <P> Gallstones are common in middle-aged gall bladders , attack three or four women to every man . Some people can live comfortably with them for years , but if the stones slip into the gall-bladder ducts and cork them up , they cause excruciating pains in the pit of the stomach , the breastbone , or the right side of the back . <P> The gall bladder is a " pear-shaped sack . . . which hangs from the under surface of the liver like a droplight from a ceiling . " The liver manufactures from 30 to 50 ounces of bile every day , and the overflow ( up to one ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as from the liver , the bile trickles into the small intestine , where it helps digest fats . <P> The formation of gallstones , says Dr. Benmosch , is very like the process of cooking old-fashioned rock candy . In candymaking , slender threads are dropped into syrup , and sugar crystallizes around the threads . In the formation of gallstones : 1 ) the juices in the gall bladder become thickened by bacterial infection ; 2 ) delicate cells drop off the bladder walls into the cavity , combine with the thick juices to form a tiny core ; 3 ) cholesterol ( one of the solids in bile ) gathers around the nucleus , hardens into a stone . <P> Most surgeons prefer to cut out the gall bladder with the stones because a sack , once diseased , usually becomes inflamed again . The operation is not difficult , and since the gall bladder is not an essential organ ( horses have none ) , a patient need only follow a low-fat diet to stay healthy . <P> Stomach Ulcers . An ulcer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excessive flow of hydrochloric acid . To the question " Why ulcers ? " Dr. Benmosch frankly answers : " We do n't know . " Most doctors blame alcohol , cigarets and nerves .
