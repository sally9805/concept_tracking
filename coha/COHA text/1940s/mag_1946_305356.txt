Martin Graebner was a 41st Division chaplain in New Guinea and the Philippines . Now he is a University of Chicago graduate student ( philosophy ) , living in a tiny prefabricated shack with his wife and baby . The Graebners have seen only one movie in the last six months . By skimping in this and a dozen other ways , solemn , 31-year-old Martin Graebner manages to scrape through on $140 a month . The G.I. Bill of Rights allows him $90 . He makes up the difference by acting as campus Lutheran chaplain . <P> Graebner 's background is not entirely typical of G.I. students ( most of whom have no profession yet ) but his budgeting problems are . A University of Chicago School of Business survey reported last week : " Veterans attending college in the Chicago area can not live on their Government allowance , but must dip into savings or take outside jobs to meet expenses . " The figures : the average single man spends $115 a month , the average married man $165 . The Government allowances are $65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans estimated that only 5% of the students were getting by on G.I. allotments alone . At U.C.L.A. one veteran , asked how much he budgeted for entertainment , replied : " We just ca n't afford it . " <P> The colleges had not been flooded-as Chicago 's Chancellor Robert M. Hutchins and others feared-with " educational hobos . " Most veterans seemed grateful for the help they got , more than glad to work out the difference . For vets out for an easy time , the 52-20 club ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) was a simpler solution . But many a vet at college still felt that the Government had promised to underwrite the whole cost of his education . So did some veteran-conscious congressmen . Three bills to increase allotments died when the 79th Congress adjourned , may be up again next session .
