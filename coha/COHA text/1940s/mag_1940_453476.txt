EVERYTHING is asleep now . The faint light from a taper standing on my trunk shows five field beds on which the other Sisters are already asleep . Their sleep is calm , much unlike the squeaks and giggles and noisy greetings that welcomed my return today . I alone am awake . Writing one 's diary becomes a sort of vice , and here I am , scribbling as fast as I can , with my book on my knees , after a day 's shaking in a cattle wagon and cart . But if one does not write things down directly , next day everything 's forgotten . What happened ? Well , nothing in particular . I arrived , said ' How do you do , ' was shown the hospital , was given dinner , and went to bed ? anti that 's all . But now , as I sit writing here , in the peace and silence of night , with the giant shadows creeping on the walls of this gloomy vaulted chamber ( I do not know why the bedroom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd of reminiscences , impressions , and plans make my head burst . I must write them down before I go to sleep . I came to this place through a world all strewn with rubbish , smelling of dirt of the filthy cattle wagon , dark with brutality , gray with misery , gloomy as if overhung by a leaden cloud . I return to my post at the last moment . Our hospital is on the front line . From every side ? north from Mohiley and from Minsk , south from Kalinowicze , cast from beyond the river Dnieper , and especially west , from the wreckage of theancient front of the Great War  --  the boundless sea of howling , cowardly , bloodthirsty mob draws in upon us . Tho people in our hospital are the same : the ' Head , ' Dr. Mroezek ; the lady-doctor , , Rizka Dowgiallo ; Mrs. Henrietta Wolbeck ? she is Head Sister , small , bright , smart , and tough as iron , never forgetting , in the most tragic moments , to draw her powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , gentle Lithuanian girl ; Ira Krzyzanowska , nicknamed Peo ' ; Halka Skibniewska , bright tomboy , with bobbed hair and a sunny smile whirls brightens the darkest hours ; and good old Olesia Bialkowska , who used to be housekeeper , a buxom old maid , slightly pretentious , but a good old soul , through and through , curling pins and all . There are other Sisters , twelve in all , but they are new to me . I think this confounded building has much to do with the gloom which weighs upon us . An old house , belonging lately to some Russians , empty since the beginning of the war , plundered half a year ago ; lately whitewashed and disinfected in order to bring in the hospital . A house without tradition and today a whitewashed tomb , without even the insignificant tradition of the last inhabitants . Arc we to give it life and warmth ? The old building has countless rooms , halls , glass and open galleries , hiding places , and twisting stairs . The hall and sickrooms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the dining room , ' crocodiles ' room , ' or respectable abode of the elder Sisters , and ' goats ' room ' or ' chapel ' in which I am writing , cold as a clog kennel . Besides these , downstairs , are the isolated parts of the hospital : the first ward for the typhus patients , izolatka ; the second room for those suspected of typhus , the separatka ; and the kitchen . A dull house , inside and outside . A dead-looking mock-garden and pseudo-park . On the other side , the red brick wall of the distillery , three hundred paces away . On the third side , something that used to be a lawn or flower bed ; on the fourth , the yard , and a little way off the first houses of the village . I do n't like to have the village under my nose . I do n't like to have a red brick wall directly before my eyes . I should n't like to have a ploughed field or a road looking as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of fresh walls . My heart is heavy . My brother Maurice is somewhere far away in the snow and darkness with his squadron . Where is he now ? I feel as if a brutal hand had grasped my heart and squeezed it hard , as the brute of a soldier I saw today did to the squirrel . Oh , God ! Anything but that dismal clay , that heavy lump in my heart and that dreadful anxiety ! A nice way to begin duty : I must pull myself together and work ? work ! A week later A week has passed since my arrival . A week , a string of days utterly uneventful , sterilized of interest like our hospital bandages ; it unrolls its white ribbon indifferently , endlessly . It covers blood , it is smeared with blood , but it always remains the same ? even , endless white ribbon . Our hospital , ourselves , our life here , are involved in that great thing called ' Poland 's military action . ' Our Army Corps is already engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on our side . We are on the east side of our Polish Army facing the Bolshevik Headquarters . The Bolsheviks harry us from the side of Osipowieze and Ziobin , and here they are preparing now a final attack , concentrating their forces . It is a good thing , at least , that there is so much work . I have two sickrooms to attend to , about sixty patients . In the evening I feel so tired sometimes that my head swims , throbs , and seems as if it would burst . Jane and Peo have set up a school for the sanitary soldiers and the children of the farm hands . In the eve . ning , after twelve hours of duty , they still feel energetic enough to stay there till late . I am much ashamed of myself , but as yet . I can not force myself to help them . Every morning I make a resolution to do so ; but in the evening I jump out of the sickly atmosphere of the ward and trudge on through the snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of an hour 's airing , but it ends in a couple of hours ' tramping . Today , for instance , I have just come back from one of these long walks . By the path trodden in the deep snow , across the fields , I always go in the same direction , to the village cemetery . The farther from the house , the more open becomes the snow-covered world , marked with thorny trees standing out against the wintry sky . It may be very poetical and easy to dream elegies in a village cemetery , or to dream of heroic crests and plumes amid the thunder of cannon . But it is hard to creep like an ant among sixty sickbeds , reeking of iodine , and know nothing and wait passively when fighting is going on around . The other Sisters laugh and talk , write letters and teach children . Do they see nothing ? Why , our days are numbered . Dr. Mroczek says nothing , but I see he knows . The chief attack of the Bolsheviks will come from Mohilev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in my conscience and try to make an honest reckoning . No , I 'm not afraid . It is not that , Only . . . there are no crests and plumes and glory ? butchery alone , tons of human flesh . And what will be the end of it ? Where is the true way that leads to Poland ? A few days later There it is . At last something has occurred that has scattered my gloomy mood and I am myself again . The hospital is nearly all evacuated ; tomorrow we shall be here no longer . That is , if we do not fall into the enemy 's hands before that time . We are like the last remnants of a crew on board a sinking ship . The boats that we await are the horses which have gone with the hospital and which will come back to fetch us . But I must begin at the beginning . Maurice always says that the most difficult thing is to make up your mind to do a thing , and that , once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a resolution and swear to myself on my honor that I will go on writing this diary under all circumstances , however hard they may be . I command no one and have a very small amount of responsibility . But I mean to be such as a member of my family ought to be . Let this witness stand beside me ; it will help me not to lose my head . Besides , a diary is like a constant examination of conscience ? like the eyes of somebody very clear , standing behind me . Having been on night duty in the hospital , I had a free morning , and resolved to make the most of it , to get out of Cichinicze into the wide world . Our officer in charge , Mr. Stiller , was going to Rohaczew , twenty miles away . We got into the broad , low , comfortable straw-filled sledge ? Peo , Halka Skibniewska , and I. That ' wide world ' ? great hubbub ? the streets crammed with loaded wagons going this way and that . We said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 3 P.M. Then we dived into the crowd . To the shops to buy some buttons , tapes , elastics , yeast , a lamp glass ? it 's shopping all the same . Suddenly ? boom ! . . Boom ! ? after a minute ? again . The street gets white with panic . People run to hide in houses and gates , their teeth chattering . What is it ? We ask the soldiers . The Bolsheviks are shelling the station . ' So , there we are ! We walk on through the streets on the excuse of shopping ? in fact , so as not to be afraid . Anyway it is a change . Terrible ? but . . . never mind . My heart feels lighter directly , as if a hand had lifted off my spirit all the depression and forebodings of former days . We arc at the cafe an hour too soon . We order cakes . The gunfire goes on , but sounds more distant . Stiller bursts in ; he is pale . Damp clusters of long fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not taken off . ' Sisters , please come directly ? everything else afterwards . ' We run out , rush into the sledge . He takes up the reins and tells the driver to whip up the horses . The sledge rolls madly from one side of the street to the other . Before coming to the station , he takes a narrow street to the right . Off we gallop , the last houses of the town are passed . Hop ! The sledge jumps up a yard high against a step . We are now in the open , on the main road . Mr. Stiller gives up the reins to the soldier and turns to us , explaining : ' We are in retreat . The whole of our first division is gone . That which you saw was the remainder of it . The Bolsheviks will be in Rohaczew in half an hour at most , if they dare enter . Our hospital has been forgotten . ' We were struck dumb by the news  - -  the horses tore on . Hard lumps from under their hoofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Stiller turned to us again : ' Remember , Sisters , not a word to anyone . I am going to the Head , ' So we waited in our goats ' room and unpacked our parcels . After a moment Henrietta sent for us . Everybody was assembled in the crocodiles ' room . Dr. Mroczek greeted us gayly . ' Well , Sisters , to work . Translocation ? Mr. Stiller brought us orders . I know there had been no orders . By evening we must be hero no longer . ' Squeaks , laughter . . . . A translocat ion is always fun , and everybody wants to get away from this house . By evening every thing was ready . At midnight the last transport had departed . We sent out MO sick men . Twenty of the worst cases and we Sisters alone remained . Nearly all the orderlies had gone with the hospital . Dr. Mroczek entered . ' Well clone , little Sisters ? and now off to your own bags and away with you ; the horses are waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeaks with delight . ' Swallow ' catches me up and dances round the room . A sledge drive in the moonlight ! ' And if there is room , take these two officers with you . They were slightly wounded , but did not go with the hospital . They are very uneasy , ' added Dr. Mroczek , and went out . If there is room enough . . . And the doctor . The Head Sister said she had to stay , because there were not enough horses . Dr. Psarski said the same , and also Rizka Dowgiallo , the chemist Nehrebecki , and the commissariat officer Stiller . That was impossible . We sent Henrietta to say that we would not go if the others were staying . The doctor was angry , but Dr. Jdzka Dowgiallo took our part . Dr. Mroczek yielded . ' Twelve of you womenfolk against me alone ? what can I do ! ' He only sent Dr. Psarski in a sledge towards Itohaczew for news . Butt rers must pack their trunks tit and ready for the journey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crammed my things into it . We went to bed . They are asleep and I 'm writing . Perhaps it will be the last time I shall write . Well , it does not matter . I am not afraid . My pencil flies over the paper . How I wish I could let that pencil write on and fly into tomorrow . What will happen ? Now I must go to sleep , the first pleasant sleep in this beastly house . Is Captivity Two days and one night have passed since we were captured by the Bolsheviks , and the second night is approaching . It is my night for duty . We are all crammed together in the izolatka , the patients and four of us Sisters who have remained ? Halka , Peo , Olesia , and I. It is the only room without broken windows , and that because it is situated at the back of the house . There is proper accommodation for four people ; now it contains twenty-three patients , as well as the four of us . It is stuffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard peeping in through the window . My hospital apron is red with the blood of the dead whom we buried . I wrap myself sip as well as I can and write , till the last moment of my life . The clay before yesterday , in the morning , we woke up with our trunks packed up . Peo and Halka were on duty ; Knocik and I went for a walk . We had not gone half a mile when suddenly we heard shots . A band of children came running towards us . A boy explained that at the entrance to Cichinicze a few Polish Uhlans were fighting with some hundred Bolsheviks . One of them had fallen from his horse ; the others caught him up on the saddle and fled . The Bolsheviks were coming on . We returned home as fast as we could . Knocik rushed ahead without waiting for me . Suddenly many shots sounded quite near . I saw that one of our lieutenants , with a few soldiers , started shooting from behind the garden fence . My eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road leading from Cichinieze , approached a thick black mass . It stopped . Small points scattered over the fields , like spilled quicksilver . The road from Cichinicze was empty by that time ; only from the other side shots came thick and fast , first high up , dzinag , dziang , then with dry knocking sounds , hitting on the fence as if nuts were cracked . Our soldiers lay down and went on shooting . I walked towards the house very slowly , just to master myself , because I felt the blood tingling in my veins . When I reached shelter , I tore into the house at full speed . Upstairs in the dining room , the windows of which face Cichinicze , I found Dr. Mroczek distributing rifles and cartridges to the remaining staff . Suddenly the lieutenant burst in . I take the command . Sanitaries , follow me ! Three of you remain under the doctor 's command ! My regiment is not far away . ' We shall easily hold our position till relief comes ! ' They ran out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows , and shots began popping . Far out , in the fields , the little black figures jumped up and ran forward . Our men aimed at them , but I did not see any result . The Bolsheviks aimed badly too . It was only after some time that dark holes began to appear in the ceiling and plaster showered upon our heads . They were aiming too high . I did not feel nervous at all in the beginning , but I knew very well that it would become hotter by and by . So I tried to brace myself up , to be sure not to funk in any case . There was nothing for us to do but to hand cartridges to those who were shooting . I sat down on a case and began to think that , as a matter of fact , there was absolutely no reason why I should be a coward . My father was always brave ; so was Maurice ; my uncles and my grandfather had been in the Insurrection . Further back , as far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family . No , I concluded , I should not turn coward . Meantime , the cannonade diminished , then stopped almost completely . Just a shot every now and then . Dr. Mroczek ordered dinner , because , he said , that business would drag on . Suddenly , we heard shots coining thick and fast , accompanied by an infernal noise of breaking glass , which poured out of all three double windows . ' Down on the floor ! ' called Dr. Mroczek . I lay down and asked , ' What is that ? ' ' Well , confound them , they are peppering at us with a machine gun from the distillery , ' answered the doctor . We found out that the pause in the shooting was due to the Bolsheviks ' hoisting up the machine gull to position on the second story of the strongly built distillery , which was about two or three hundred yards distant from our house . Now they could shoot at our men in the garden from above with an advantage . I crawled towards the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red unplastered building I saw the black nose of a machine gun pulling nervously at something below , to the left . The door , banged with boot and gun , flew open suddenly and in burst a soldier , his peasant face heated by the utmost interior fire , a face such as Kossak likes to paint . ' Cartridges ! Our men are shooting their last . ' I filled his pockets with cartridges ; Peo seized a water bottle from the table ( the glass was gone somewhere ) and handed it to him . He drank with great gulps . We filled our aprons with as many cartridges as we could , and carried them to the garden . Our men were shooting from behind the trees , running constantly from one tree to another . The lieutenant ordered it so that the Bolsheviks might think there were more of them . We went to and from the house carrying full aprons of cartridges . The machine gun clucked , but there was no time to be afraid . Each time we came from the house we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and footprints stretching out beyond the garden , into the fields . We brought enough cartridges , so , slipping home for the last time , Peo stopped me in the hall . From the hall there is a door to the laboratory . She opened a cupboard , found what she wanted , gliding with her deft , manicured fingers over familiar jars and bottles , lifted a glass stopper , took out small bottles with a white powder inside . " Zosia , ' said Peo , ' take that ? it is strychnine . Keep it on you . . . but only in extreme emergency . . . in extrem-i-ty , remember ! ' 1 hid the bottle in a pocket , under my apron . They say that soldiers are less afraid of bullets when they have gun in hand . Those bottles certainly had a calming effect on us . Pm snatched up a bottle of ether . We must break it so that they would n't get drunk on it . I grasped another big bottle . We ran out under the machine-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly it goes through that thin neck ! After some seconds which seemed an eternity , I smashed the bottle against the steps of the porch . Then we realized that we might just as well have done it indoors , in the laboratory . Coining back , we seized a big can of alcohol . The clack of a few bullets on the door stopped us ; we could not break that metal can . On second thoughts , we poured its contents into the water closet . As we came back , the entrance door opened and in ran the lieutenant in command of our defense . ' Where is the Head Doctor ? ' he asked , breathing heavily . We ran upstairs together . There we came upon an idyllic scene . The Sisters sat round the table , curled up and looking rather sheepish , while Dr. Mroczek , ladle in hand , served tomato soup into the plates , joking , and saying that , if we must go to the other world , better go with a full stomach than with an empty one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Mroczek ! Ile fell today into the grave so clumsily that I had to straighten his neck . ) The lieutenant burst out : ' It is not a time for making fun . The sanitaries have all fled . Down below only Stiller , Nehrebecki , and my men continue shooting . Is there a horse ? I shall skip over to my regiment for help , because I alone know the country round here . It is the last hope . ' You can take my Nelly , or Haiku 's mare , ' I put in from my corner . Where are they ? ' I will show you , ' I answered , and ran out with him . So once again I had to run out of the safe protecting door into the rain of bullets . Every time when I jumped out I felt as if I were leaping into cold water ? but after the first moment it was all right , I swam on . I ran out and the lieutenant followed me . The stables were halfway towards the machine gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their shelter and heard the bullets whip the cloth and clash upon the preserve tins , The Bolsheviks had noticed us . The machine-gun fire chased us and tramped on our heels . Before it caught us , we were in the stables . At the same time the machine gun began hailing bullets upon the wooden wall of the building . White holes appeared . The horses , mad with fear , roared and plunged , tied to their leather straps . Nelly 's nervous wiry body was straining like a bowstring . The lieutenant put on the saddle . I fastened the reins . I ran to open the stable door ; it crashed open , making a square patch of light . Horse and rider leaped out . Good-bye , Sister ! ' was all I heard . Mad shooting followed him . Now I began running again from cart to cart and up to the porch . After an unproductive race , the machine gun came back at me while I struggled in vain with the locked front door . Seeing it was no good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , the izolatka . Here I came upon an entirely different world ? the everyday hospital life . Half of our patients were unconscious , not knowing anything of what was going on . Peo and Lala had succeeded in calming the others . They went about , talking to the patients , giving medicine . Lala , who had been on night duty , had not left the sickroom and had not eaten anything yet . She went about her duties with absolute calm , but half dazed . I told her to go and rest , but it took ages to persuade the obstinate Lithuanian girl to go . Finally she started making notes for me about the medicines taken by each man , and she dressed me in her apron , not forgetting to button it neatly and to smooth my ruffled white collar . She had hardly turned to go when suddenly we heard a deafening bang . Somebody must have thrown a hand grenade into our house . The sick jumped out of bed in a panic , which spreads so easily in a defenseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie to calm the men , when suddenly we heard a series of explosions . ' Lela , ' I shouted through the noise of bursting shells , ' say the Sub tuum prcesidium , for I might get the words mixed up myself . ' Lala knelt before the Mndonna 's picture . It was a very large Byzantine picture of Cur Lady , with a dark face and a golden robe , very old and in the possession of my family for many centuries past . I had saved it from our house and now it drew the eyes of all our group of sick , helpless men . I fell on my knees and repeated the prayer after Lala ; the sick echoed the words , and the panic ceased . We felt that from that moment our souls were united for better or worse . I had proposed prayer as a means of calming the patients , but as I knelt down the spirit of prayer overcame me . I can not recollect the words , but the thoughts I remember . ' 0 God of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best looked for so many ages on our deadly strifes ; before that very , very picture of thine my ancestors have prayed ever since they embraced Christianity . 0 thou , our Help and Consolation , how many times women and children and old men have turned to thee as their only refuge ! ' Outside , the noise and shooting had stopped . Peace reigned inside our sickroom . Suddenly the door opened and the head of Halka Skibniewska appeared . She beckoned to me . I went with her into the passage . Three of our soldiers stood there , with guns still smoking . Zosia , what can we do with them ? ' asked Hale with despair in her voice . The Bolsheviks arc in the garden . They will be here in a moment . They may possibly let the sick alone , but what about these ? ' I looked at ' these . ' They stood there , motionless , waiting for our decision . They had been shooting to the last moment , and now their faces expressed wild determination . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the latter shows only passive indifference in tragic moments . I felt a flow of admiration for those men . It seemed that at that moment there was no one dearer to me . We had to save them . Get into bed ! ' I called . There 's no time , ' whispered Halka feverishly . Quickly I opened the store under the staircase . We ran in with the soldiers and I shut the door . Undress , ' I commanded , pulling at a boot while Mika pulled at a sleeve . When they were in their underclothes we gave them slippers and dressing gowns . Quick , to the sickroom and to bed , ' I ordered . It 's no good , ' said one of them , a gloomy giant . ' Only trouble in vain for the young ladies . ' Please , Sisters , ' said another , there is a peasant from the village who is leading those Bolsheviks and showing them the way . He had a quarrel with Stasze- wicz here . He was jealous about a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The third , a short , flaxen-haired , red-faced peasant from Masovia , straightened himself to say , ' That 's right . ' What should we do ? They must not be recognized . ' Halka , shave and bandage . ' I looked round the shed ; there , in the corner , I saw large dusty scissors ? probably used in former clays to shear sheep or to cut wire . With that old rusty instrument I proceeded to cut Staszewicz 's hair in a shameful way , leaving clumps all over his head . Halka found in her apron pocket small manicure scissors , so her work with the two other soldiers went quicker . When hair and moustaches were shaved , we seized bandage , gauze , and iodine . I painted half of Staszewicz 's head with iodine , rubbing it in so hard with cotton wool that the skin became black . ' And if they ask us what is our sickness ? ' asked the poor fellows , who began to regain hope . Make no reply ; you have brain fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool on Staszewicz 's head . ' And you have inflammation of the jaw ? and you dysen ( cry . ' Having pronounced this diagnosis , we put them to bed and breathed a sigh of relief . Now we picked up the guns and uniforms and carried them far away , into the garden , into the shrubbery . Peo walked ahead , erect , indifferent to the whistle of bullets ; I tried to do the same . Hardly had we returned when suddenly we heard a wild roar in the courtyard . A black crowd covered the lawn , I could distinguish the faces of those nearest , distorted with fury . We heard . no words , only a thunder-like yell of the mob , gathered into one roar . The faces of our patients seemed petrified , only the hands ? thin , parchment : like hands  --  pressed round the handles of the stretchers . These hands lived and strained and spoke of a terrible anxiety , After a moment we shook off our inertia and said to each other , ' We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Halka stayed while I went to get news . On the way I came upon the keeper of the stores and Nehrebccki , the chemist , cutting off their N.C.O. shoulder straps . I began to understand the yell of the crowd : ' Co-o-ome o-o-outl ' From the courtyard , through the bolted door , a horrible voice was crying , ' Co-ome o-out , all of you ! Officers first ? those who do n't come will be shot all the same ! ' By the narrow staircase leading from the first floor a sad troop of men and women descended , reluctantly , with bowed heads . First went Dr. Mroczek , pale but calm he was speaking to those behind . I saw him put some sort of white powder into his mouth as he unbolted the door . Behind him Henrietta , then Lala with a glazed look in her eyes , fixed before her . Behind her those two officers , then Stiller and Lesiewski , carrying his little daughter in his arms . His wife was trying to hold him back by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Stachu , do n't go there ? Stachu , do n't go there , do n't go there ! ' She evidently did not understand her own words , repeating them mechanically in horrible anguish . Last came the Sisters in a compact group . Knocik , Stasia and Ela , sobbing aloud , and Dr. Azka Dowgiallo , with her hands in her jacket pockets and her head proudly thrown back . I caught her by the sleeve as she passed me . ' Mrs. gzka , where are you all going ? ' ' Why , do n't you hear they are telling us to come out ? We can not continue the defense . The Head wants to explain to them that this is a hospital , and that they should leave us in peace . Well , come along , we must not exasperate them . ' Suddenly her eyes fell on my apron and cap . ' On duty , Zosia ? Good , then , go back to your patients . ' A Bolshevik burst in through the open door , brandishing the butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and returned to the ward . Here I found Peo and Haiku struggling with poor Olesia , who , screaming like a peacock , tried alternately to stuff herself under a bed and to leap out of the window into the garden . At last we succeeded in calming her , and she fell exhausted into an armchair . Comparative silence reigned in the sickroom again , a silence broken now and again by shots . Who can be shooting now and why ? They probably want to frighten us out of the house . They sha n't . After a moment we heard a banging at our door , and hoarse yells : Co-ome 0-out ! Those who do n't obey will be killed all the same ! ' But they fell back before we decided what to answer . A short calm ? then angry shouting of Russian voices . Then for one moment we caught the calm voice of Dr. Mroczek , but it died in the hubbub . Suddenly a horrible scream from Henrietta . Then a shot . Then a dozen more shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish . We sprang to the door and wanted to run to where some awful tragedy was going on . But in that moment from all corners of the sickroom voices rose in supplication : ' Sisters , do n't leave us . ' One of the soldiers we had just put to bed jumped out and lay down on the threshold to bar the passage . ' Kill us first , Sisters . ' Kill us , Sisters , ' groaned the ward . One man , unconscious with typhoid fever , rolled his head on the pillow , fixing us with his burning , senseless eyes . Parched lips opened , but no words were uttered ; only those eyes spoke . ' 0o-ooh ! ' a groan escaped his throat , a moaning call for help . There is something strangely pathetic in the helplessness of so many grown men . A boy of sixteen , a voluntary soldier , ? a great favorite of all the hospital , who had passed the typhus crisis and was getting better , ? drew out his thin hand from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that bloodless boyish hand , which reminded me of the orphanage children catching hold of their young lady , ' asking for sweets . All right , all right , ' we told the sick . We will remain with you , of course we will . We only wanted to know something ? perhaps to help someone . There is something bad going on there . And no harm will be done to you here , you know . ' We sat down on the edges of the stretchers , trying to calm the more restless . Sick men arc like children ; they are calmed easily . A few minutes afterwards silence again reigned in the hospital , silence broken now and then by the sniffings of Olesia , who , sitting in a corner , was blowing her nose loudly . A terrible uncertainty beset us . We could neither go out nor speak to each other . The eyes of all our patients , heavy with anguish , were fixed on us . Only with our eyes could we communicate to each other the unmistakable knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Why did Henrietta scream like that ? ' Suddenly we heard a simultaneous banging at all the windows ? again that same intolerable yell : Co-once 0-0-out ! ' Behind the door a voice began to speak Russian . ( What hoarse voices those men have ! ) ' Ey , you there ? why have you not come out yet ? We thought we had finished with you all and here there are some more of you . Simeon , climb in through the window and drive them all out of there ! ' Our windows , though on the ground floor , were pretty high . ' Climb in yourself , if you want to risk your head , ' grumbled Simeon . We must speak to them , ' said Peo . So we went all three to the window , which we opened . At the sight of us the crowd began to yell louder . Two Red soldiers were standing on a bench , making faces and obscene gestures at us . I gripped my bottle of strychnine firmer in my hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to make herself heard . ' Listen to us , you fellows , ' she began in Russian . ' It is understood that we are your prisoners , but you must understand that we can not leave this room because of the sick men lying here . Of course you will do them no harm . We have no weapons ; you can come in and see for yourselves . ' Oh , do n't be afraid ? we do n't know how to shoot , ' she added after a moment , with a somewhat humorous disdain which she could not restrain . As a matter of fact , the ' heroes ' looked as if they were in no hurry to answer our invitation , fearing a trap of some kind . They did not enter the house , although the door was broken out . They only repeated obstinately and stupidly : ' Co-ome out , we tell you ! If not , we will set the house on fire . ' A young lad stepped out , an anemic type of army clerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from sword and knife to revolver and hand grenades hanging from his belt . He shouted : What 's the use of hobnobbing with those cursed blood-drinkers ! Do n't you know how to shoot ! And who killed our sailor who lies there on the road ! That 's what you deserve ! ' He pulled out a hand grenade and hurled it at us . We sprang aside . The hand grenade , well-aimed , fell on the floor , at the other end of the room , between the unconscious typhus patient and the young volunteer boy . We knew that hand grenades do not explode on falling , but only a few moments after the safety stop has been pulled out by the thrower . Our eyes were turned spellbound to the small object , lying on the border of two lives . The typhus patient was perfectly unconscious , but the boy jumped up on the bed and , wrapped in his blanket , stood pressing himself against the wall in an agony of fear . We felt our knees bend . What the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that black point between the two stretchers . Luckily the hand grenade did not explode . We sat frightened , not knowing what to do , afraid to go up to the window ? where guns and grenades threatened us . . . . But what was that new word which the mob began to shout ? It was no longer ' Come out ! ' Pialka suddenly grew pale . ' They want to burn us , ' she gasped . It was true . ' Fire ! Burn them ! ' the crowd was roaring . In a sudden determination , Halka approached the window . One step , like a leap into eternity ? and she stood out , in her white hospital apron , framed by the window casement . The first clouds of smoke rose in gusts from below , screening her now and then from the eyes of the crowd . ' Listen to me , put the fire out ! ' called Halka . ' We will all come out ? only help us to carry out the patients ! ' A mocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful when somebody gives them occasion to laugh . Amid the jeerings and mockings , unexpectedly , without any reason whatever , the atmosphere became less hostile . ' Leave them alone and let them go to the deuce . Let them be roasted , if they like . Hurry up ; do n't you see the house is burning ? ' Hearing that , Peo and I leaned out of the window to see what was going on . ' And if you wo n't come out we can go in and we can roast you , ' sympathetically remarked a thin , consumptive-looking man with a goatee , throwing an armful of damp straw under our window . ' A little sauce wo n't hurt , ' called out a beardless Bolshevik , with the nice rosy face of a boy of eighteen . So speaking , he poured on the straw a canful of paraffin , stolen from our supplies , amid general approval . Thick black suffocating smoke entered the room . We closed the window and ran to save the patients . Luckily our separatha had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be beyond our strength . We stuck in the corridor with our first patient , a tall , strong man , sick with brain fever . Impossible ; we had twenty-three patients . And besides , what use would it be to carry them out into the keen frost ? We carried the litter in again . Deathlike silence fell on our ward . I saw some of the conscious men 's lips move silently , as if in prayer . Peo buried her face in her hands , praying probably also . Behind the damp windows puffs of brown smoke rose into the air . It was a bright day , with the sun streaming in through the windows ; but the smoke had become so thick that it obscured the light at times . After a moment , light shone again in the ward . Halka and I wrote sitting on an empty litter awaiting death . How long we sat there I do not know . Each of us was probably examining her conscience and bidding her people farewell . I think it must have lasted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the window I saw that the crowd had dispersed , the straw and paraffin which had been laid at the four corners of the house had gone out , and only some of the beams smoked . Opening the window , I leaned out and saw a number of people crossing the courtyard bending over something , which was lying on the ground . The same thing happened in many places and on the road as well . In the farmyard a crowd surrounded the hospital wagons , which were loaded with food and clothes , stealing what they could lay their hands on . I shut the window . Halka and Peo lifted up their heads . ' Well , Zosia , how is it ? ' ' Better than we could expect , it seems to me . The fire has gone out . But do you hear . . In the rooms above us we heard distinctly the tramping of many feet and a hubbub of voices . Peo rose and took my hand . ' Come , Zosia , we will go upstairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sisters . Halka and Olesia will remain with the patients . ' So wo went upstairs together . The staircase was all muddy and dripping with melted snow , carried on the boots of the band . In the dining room a crowd of Bolsheviks were sitting round the table . With wild laughter and yelling they were snatching food out of full plates . All the spoons and knives and forks had been thrown on the floor . One Bolshevik had seized the soup tureen and tilted it , drinking greedily , indifferent to the streams of soup which were pouring behind his collar and clown his clothes . Several others standing behind were shaking him and demanding to have their turn . The beautiful large white azalea standing in the middle of the room , covered with snow-white flowers , was dripping with tomato sauce . Disgusted with the sight , we drew back unnoticed and went towards our goats ' room . There , besides the Bolsheviks , a whole crowd of peasants ? men , women , and children ? were plundering . All our boxes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wooden ones broken with the butt ends of guns , and our belongings thrown out on the floor . Women with horrible animal faces were ferreting and looking into all the corners of the room , pulling , tearing , and cramming away their spoils . Some of them were weeping and pitying us all the time . One especially , a big strong woman , was crying heartily , sniffing loudly . She kissed our hands , groaning ' Oh , poor dear ! ' every now and then , greedily cramming each time some new object into her large apron , which was already bulging and full . The Bolsheviks , armed with guns , lifted up now and then with the tines of their bayonets some new part of our apparel , crying out , ' Who wants that ? ' And , according to what the object proved to be , either a dozen hands were stretched out for it ( shoes and overcoats were most in demand ) or else it was thrown out of the window amid laughter and jokes . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other dainty articles , because the women took only the stronger linen , several pairs of our slippers , our needlework , and ? oh , horror ! ? Olesia 's false hair , which she must have forgotten to put on in the general confusion . Nobody took any notice of us . I squeezed through the crowd with difficulty towards toy bed , thinking that I might rescue some of my things . To my great surprise I noticed that one of my trunks had not been opened . It had been pushed under the bed and had escaped notice . Knceling beside it , I took out some of the things which I cared for most , leaving the rest . This diary I took out , the leather-covered book with my favorite poems , the prayer book which I had got on the day of my First Communion , and the stirrups which I had brought for Maurice but had not had the opportunity to live him , Before going down , I stopped to look round and see where Peo was . I saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way towards the door , energetically pushing aside those who would not let her pass . How strange that crowd was ! It not only tolerated but seemed to approve of our taking a share in the spoil . It rolffied calmly and shamelessly , in the sight of the owners . You could not call those people bandits ? just jackals . We got out into the corridor at last , and from there to the sickroom . Here only Peo proudly exhibited her spoils . Darling Peo ! ? unselfish as usual . Of her own things she had hardly taken anything , but each of us found something of ours ; Haiku her cloak , Olesia her uniform and boots , I my leather jacket and sweater . We found some linen and underclothes and several keepsakes of absent Sisters ? such as Hanka Trzcinska 's miniature portrait of her mother . : Raffia , encouraged by our example , also decided to go to carry off some more th ings . We enjoyed it immensely , and were much amused . For really , was it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see the joke and declared she would not move , begging us not to leave her alone . Peo remained to keep her company , while Halka and I went up to our goats ' room ; here , among the robbing women , we saw our maid Fruzia , who had already filled her apron with our things . Halka ran up to her . ' What a good thing you are here ! Please help us bring down some th ings . ' Fruzia looked askance at Halka , then gazed round fearfully and , shrugging her shoulders , answered in Russian : What do you want with me ? I do n't know you ' and quickly mixed in the crowd . We carried down some more things , but could not forget Fruzia . On our return to the ward , we noticed a white board hanging outside our door . U pon the board was written in Russian this inscription : - COMPARTMENT FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES TYPHUS - SMALLPDX - DYSENTERY Peo explained that she had put up that board during our absence , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever an undesirable guest ap- preached the door and read the inscription , he flew away like anything . But we were still in ignorance about what had happened to the rest of our Sisters . We were especially uneasy about Lala . Oh , why did she not stay with us ! We held a council and decided that we must find out what had happened to them and to the others . Peo and Olesia remained with the patients , and Haiku. and I went in quest of information . We met a lot of men at every step , but they either would not or could not tell us any-t king . Besides , seeing our white aprons , they tried to keep as far from us as they could . Some of them were even afraid to speak to us : ' You come from the infectious hospital . Keep away , Sisters , keep away , farther back ! ' Thinking we might learn something in the farm or in the village , we went out . It was late in the afternoon . The hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes seemed to scatter . Everything was becoming gray and cold . The crows were settling for their night 's rest with a low rustling of wings and shifting to make themselves more comfortable on the stiff branches of the trees . There , high above us , light still lingered , but below dusk was falling . In that twilight we distinguished a patch on the snow . We approached . A man was lying face downwards , half naked and his feet bare . We leaned over him . On his cropped hair there was a stain , as if from a blow , and a little blood . ' Perhaps he is still alive , ' we thought . ' Perhaps it is one of ours . ' We touched him with our hands . A hard cold hostility met my fingers . I started up . ' Halka , it is a corpse ! ' An icy fear seized me . I should have liked to run away . But something held my feet . Halka spoke in her melodious penetrating voice : Zosia , calm yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything for this poor fellow , but we must see who he is . ' A sickly feeling came over me . I struggled hard against it . Halka was trying to turn the man 's face upwards . With an utmost effort I seized him by the shoulders . We turned him slowly on his back . The open eyes of our Head Doctor stared at us ? from the trampled snow at our feet . We stood helplessly beside the corpse , looking out into the strangely empty world . Suddenly I caught Halka by the arm . A few steps farther another body was lying . . . a third . I looked round wildly behind me . . . a fourth . . . fifth , just visible in the dark which throws a veil over everything that is farther off . ' How many corpses are here ? ' I asked in a hoarse voice that sounded strange to me ? and then a horror came over me , because it seemed to me that somebody else had spoken . I began to tremble all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they arc not all dead . ' At this thought all fear departed . Hand in hand we ran up to every corpse in turn . Trembling with emotion and anguish , we turned over the bodies . I was no longer afraid ? no , only in a great hurry . We listened to their hearts ? in vain , all in vain . Some of them we did not even try to listen to ? they lay , a horrible mass , in a pool of blood ? covered with snow . Mr. Stiller lay near Dr. Mroczek . His face was frozen in a contortion of anger , his teeth showing , his fists clenched . Who knows ? perhaps he had thrown himself in the critical moment to the Head 's rescue . Nowakowski , poor fellow , had a broad , deep wound on his neck . Cutting off his officer 's shoulder straps did not help him . Near by were the two wounded officers  --  our patients . A few steps farther , we found a body which we could not recognize at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dark thick hair , his eyes closed , his face sweet and serene , almost smiling . He seemed to us to be only asleep , because we could not find at first sight the wound which had caused his death . ' Nehrebecki ! ' exclaimed Halka suddenly . ' He always wore his wedding ring on his second finger . They have been trying to take it off . Look at the skin torn off ! ' Nehrebecki ! How strangely death changes people ! It ennobles their faces or makes them animal-like . Nehrebecki had fought to the last moment . Halka had seen him shoot in the garden when all the others had thrown down their guns . Gun in hand , he had come to this place , to fight . The gun lay beside him , and his stiffened fingers were on it . That face , which looked as if a beautiful serene light shone through it , we could not recognize for that of our chemist Nehrebecki . Beside the dead bodies little groups of village children were hustling round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throwing snow and frozen mud at the faces , amid laughter . Little gray animals , melting noiselessly into the gray darkness at our approach . One thing became clear we could not leave the bodies of our dead a prey to those children and perhaps to beasts . So we returned home to fetch litters , and , calling Peo away , left Olesia with the patients and then once more departed . We met several Bolsheviks loafing about and asked them to help us , but a curse was all that we could get from them . It was with a great effort that I began the office of gravedigger . I knelt in the snow beside the first corpse , unable to decide to put my hands under it . Again Halka 's and Pco 's example spurred me on . We put Dr. Mroczek and Stiller on the stretchers . Halka remained with Stiller and the other dead , while Peo and I carried Dr. Mroczek . Oh dear , what a weight it was , to carry thus a human body over snowdrifts ! Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every so often we stuck and were forced to put down the litters on the snow . Our feet stag . gered , our legs bent , as if they were made of dough . We sank in the snow and rose . We had only one desire and one sinking fear at heart , not to let the corpse fall out . Things went better afterwards . One of us , always changing , remained on guard ; the others dragged the body ? one could hardly say they carried it . But our nervous effort doubled our strength , and the last round went easier and much quicker . Ten of those bodies we carried in this fashion , although some lay farther away than the others and the last was far out , on the main road leading to the village , about half a mile away from the house . We set the ten stretchers under our windows , so as to be able to look out , and , if necessary , defend the bodies . It had become completely dark . My nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , my hands suddenly felt limp and I slipped fainting beside the litter OIL the snow . Its fresh cold touch brought consciousness back and I rose to my feet before Peo ran up to help me . Oh , for a rest ! In a moment we should have it , if only Halka would bring the sheets to cover the dead . Suddenly a small figure wrapped in a large shawl slipped out of the darkness . A childish hand pulled at my apron and a child 's voice whispered , ' Sister . ' I recognized one of the Swallow 's pupils , who told its in a broken voice that beyond the garden , near the smithy , a Polish soldier was lying , that the Bolsheviks broke his head in the morning , and that he lived and screamed for a long time . The little girl was afraid , so she hid in a potato dump and came out to tell the Sisters only when it was dark . There was nothing to do . Halka , who is the weakest of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with the little girl . The sight was more terrible than all . The others were shot ; this man had been murdered with a piece of iron . His head was battered beyond recognition and brains were coming out of the skull . The trampled snow denoted that there had been many assailants , and that the athletic man had fought long and desperately . The girl shrieked and fled on seeing the bloody mess , and we were left alone with him , in the field . How we dragged the body to the house I do not know . As through a mist , I remember that when we had crawled up to the house I was kneeling beside the stretcher , unable to let go of the handles . I could not unbend my fingers and knelt waiting for Peo to help me . Meanwhile the Bolsheviks had put sentinels in front of our door and would not let us in . The frost was very keen and we were only in our hospital aprons . Oh , never mind ! We sat down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one of the commanders , on a round , gave orders that we should be let in . In our ward the air was stifling . People were crammed like herrings in a barrel . Halka and Olesia were lying on the floor with only their arms under their heads . They made room for us . Every now and then one of us would get up to give medicine or make a camphor injection or perform some other hospital duty . I tried to go to sleep , but the faces of the eleven dead stood up before my shut eyes . I must have been a little feverish , for after a moment I ceased to distinguish where I was , and the difference between dream and reality . After a horrible nightmare , I woke up and looked round . Where was I ? And why did my feet ache so ? Why , of course , they always do after a ball . It seemed to me I was in Slepianka , where I have been dancing a lot , and was dancing still . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stas R. was showing some funny step which he had learned in Paris . Mr. Z. invites me to dance with him . I can not , I 'm dancing with that tall Uhlan with a pince-nez . ' You see , I ca n't possibly , Mr. Z. ! ' ' Mr. Z. , Mr. Z. ! ' I called . Everything disappeared . I lifted my head and saw Peo sleeping . Oh , it is the goats ' room . ' But why are you dressed , Pco darling ? Are you on duty ? ' I ran up to the window . There was a full moon . In its light I saw a row of bodies and dead faces . Unclosed eyes with frozen pupils were gazing at me . I awoke . but when I regained my place and stretched myself on the floor , the phantoms returned . After a fearful nightmare , I caught Halka by the arm . ' Oh , Halka darling , do you know that I ca n't laugh ? It is horrible , but I feel that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Halle ? do you also feel like that ? ' Halka put a cold hand on my forehead , then got up and came back to me after a moment with a glass of something she gave me to drink . It was dawn before I could go to sleep .
