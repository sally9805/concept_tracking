says the third baby is the easiest one to have , and now I know why . It 's the easiest because it 's the funniest , because you 've been there twice , and you know . You know , for instance , how you 're going to look in a maternity dress about the seventh month , and you know how to release the footbrake on a baby carriage without fumbling amateurishly , and you know how to tie your shoes before and do knee-chests after , and while you 're not exactly casual , you 're a little bit off-hand about the whole thing . Sentimental people keep insisting that women go on to have a third baby because they love babies , and cynical people seem to maintain that a woman with two healthy , active children around the house will do anything for ten quiet days in the hospital ; my own position is somewhere between the two , but I agree that the third is the easiest . The whole event is far too recent for me to be deluded . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary discomfort . No one sent me any dainty pink sweaters , for instance . We only received one pair of booties , and those were a pair of rosebud-covered white ones that someone had sent my first child when he was born and which I had given , still in their original pink tissue paper , to a friend when her first child was born ; she had subsequently sent them to her cousin in Texas for a second baby , and the cousin sent them back East on the occasion of a mutual friend 's twins ; the mutual friend gave them to me , with a card saying " Love to Baby , " and the pink tissue paper hardly ruffled . I have them carefully set aside , because I know someone who is having a baby in June . I borrowed back my baby carriage from my next-door neighbor , took the crib down out of the attic , washed my way through the chest of baby shirts and woollen shawls , briefed the two incumbent children far enough ahead of time , and spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew exactly what I was taking with me to the hospital , but assembling it took time and eventually required an emergency trip to New York from our home in Vermont . I packed it , though , finally : a yellow nightgown trimmed with lace , a white nightgown that tied at the throat with a blue bow , two of the fanciest bed-jackets I could find ? that was what I went to New York for ? and then , two pounds of homemade fudge , as many mystery stories as I could cram in , and a hag of apples . Almost at the last minute I added a box of pralines , a bottle of expensive cologne , and my toothbrush . I have heard of people who take their own satin sheets to the hospital but that has always seemed to me a waste of good suitcase space . My doctor was very pleasant and my friends were very thoughtful ; for the last two weeks before I went to the hospital almost everyone I know called me almost once a day and said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled on a weekend to visit us when , according to the best astronomical figuring , I should have had a two-weeks-old baby ready to show them ; they arrived , were entertained with some restraint on my part , and left , eyeing me with disfavor and some suspicion . My mother sent me a telegram from California saying " Is everything all right ? Shall I come ? Where is baby ? " My children were sullen , my husband was embarrassed . EVERYTHING was , as I say , perfectly nor- mal , up to and including the frightful moment when I leaped out of bed at two in the morning as though there had been a pea under the mattress ; when I turned on the light my husband said sleepily , " Having baby ? " " I really do n't know , " I said nervously . I was looking for the clock , which I hide at night so that in the morning when the alarm rings I will have to wake up looking for it . It was hard to find it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my husband asked without any sign of pleased anticipation . " I ca n't find the clock , " I said . " Clock ? " my husband said . " Clock . Wake me five minutes apart . " I unlocked the suitcase and took out a mystery story , and sat down in the armchair with a blanket over me . After a few minutes the cat , who usually sleeps on the foot of my son 's bed , wandered in and settled down on a corner of the blanket by my feet . She slept as peacefully as my husband did most of the night , except that now and then she raised her head to regard me with a look of silent contempt . ? Because we live in a small country town and our hospital is five miles away I had an uneasy feeling that I ought to allow plenty of time , particularly since neither of us has ever learned to drive and consequently I must call our local taxi to take me to the hospital . At seven-thirty I called my doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said I would just give the children their breakfast and wash up the dishes and then run over to the hospital , and he said that wouldbe just fine and he 'd plan to meet me later , then ; the unspoken conviction between us was that I ought to be back in the fields before sundown . I went into the kitchen and proceeded methodically to work , humming cheerfully and stopping occasionally to grab the back of a chair and hold my breath . My husband told me later that he found his cup and saucer ( the one with " Father " written on it ) in the oven , but I am inclined to believe that he was too upset to be a completely reliable reporter . My own recollection is of doing everything the way I have a thousand times before ? school-morning short-cuts so familiar that / am hardly aware , usually , or of doing them at all . The frying pan , for instance . My single immediate object was a cup of coffee , and I decided to heat up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to make fresh ; it seemed brilliantly logical to heat it in the frying pan because anyone knows that a broad shallow container will heat liquid faster than a tall narrow one , like the coffeepot . I will not try to deny , however , that it looked funny . By the time the children came down everything seemed to be moving along handsomely ; my son grimly got two glasses and filled them with fruit juice for his sister and himself . He offered me one , but I had no desire to eat , or in fact to do anything which might upset my precarious balance between two , and three , children , or to interrupt my morning 's work for more than coffee , which / was still doggedly making in the frying pan . My husband came downstairs , sat in his usual place , said good-morning to the children , accepted the glass of fruit juice my son poured for him , and asked me brightly , " How do you feel ? " " Splendid , " I said , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing wonderfully Ivell . " " Good , " he said . " How soon do you think we ought to leave ? " " Around noon , probably , " I said . " Everything is fine , really . " My husband asked politely , " May I help you with breakfast ? " " No indeed , " I said . I stopped to catch my breath and smiled reassuringly . " I feel . so well , " I said . " Would you be offended , " he said , still very politely , " if I took this egg out of my glass ? " " Certainly not , " I said . " I 'm sorry , I ca n't think how it got there . " " It 's nothing at all , " my husband said . " I was just thirsty . " They were all staring at me oddly , and I kept giving them my reassuring smile ; I did feel splendid ; my months of waiting were nearly over , my careful preparations had finally been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow nightgown . " I 'm so pleased , " I said . I was slightly dizzy , perhaps . And there were pains , but they were authentic ones , not the feeble imitations I had been dreaming up the past few weeks . I patted my son on the head . " Well , " / said , in the tone I had used perhaps five hundred times in the last months . " Well , do we want a little boy or a little boy ? " " Wo n't you sit down ? " my husband said . He had the air of a man who expects that an explanation will somehow be given him for a series of extraordinary events in which he is unwillingly involved . " I think you ought to sit down , " he added urgently . It was about then that I realized that he was right . I ought to sit down . As a matter of fact , I ought to go to the hospital , right now , immediately . I dropped my reassuring smile and the fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better hurry , " I said inadequately . My husband called the taxi and brought down my suitcase . The children were going to stay with friends , and one of the things I had planned to do was drop them off on my way to the hospital ; now , however , I felt vitally that I had not the time . I began to talk fast . " You 'll have to take care of the children , " I told my husband . " See that . ... " I stopped . I remember thinking with incredible clarity and speed . " See that they finish their breakfast , " I said . Pajamas on the line , I thought , school , cats , toothbrushes . Milkman . Overalls to be mended ; laundry . " I ought to make a list , " I said vaguely . " Leave a note for the milkman tomorrow night . Soap , too . We need soap . " " Yes , dear , " my husband kept saying . " Yes dear yes dear . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . " See you later , " myson said casually . " Have a good time . " " Bring me a present , " my daughter added . " Do n't worry about a thing , " my husband said . " Now , do n't you worry , " I told him . " There 's nothing to worry about . " " Everything will be fine , " I said . " Do n't worry . " I waited for a good moment and then scrambled into the taxi without grace ; I did not dare risk my reassuring smile on the taxi driver but I nodded to him briskly . " I 'll be with you in an hour , " my husband said nervously . " And do n't worry . " " Everything will be fine , " I said " Do n't worry . " " Nothing to worry about , " the taxi driver said to my husband , and we started off , my husband standing at the curb wringing his hands and the taxi tacking insanely from side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I SAT very still in the back seat , trying not to breathe . I had one arm lovingly around my suitcase , which held my yellow nightgown , and I tried to light a cigarette without using any muscles except those in thy hands and my neck , and still not let go of my suitcase . " Going to be a beautiful day , " I said co the taxi driver at last . We had a twenty-minute trip ahead of us at least ? much longer , if he continued his zig-zag path . " Pretty warm for the time of year . " " Pretty warm yesterday , too . " the taxi driver said . " It was warm yesterday , " I conceded , and stopped to catch my breath . The driver , who was obviously avoiding looking at me in the mirror , said a little bit hysterically , " Probably be warm tomorrow , too . " I waited for a minute , and then I was able to say , dubiously , " I do n't know as it will stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , " the taxi driver said , " it was sure warm yesterday . " " Yesterday , " I said . " Yes , that was a warty day . " " Going to be nice today , too , " the taxi driver said . I clutched my suitcase tighter and made some small sound ? more like a yelp than anything else ? and the taxi veered madly off to the left and then began to pick up speed with enthusiasm . " Very warm indeed , " the driver babbled , leaning forward against the wheel . " Warmest day I ever saw for the time of year . Usually this time of year it 's colder . Yesterday it was terribly --  " " It was not , " I said . " It was freezing . I can see the tower of the hospital . " " I remember thinking how warm it was , " the driver said . He turned into the hospital drive . " It was so warns I noticed it right away . ' This is a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . " We pulled up with a magnificent flourish at the hospital entrance , and the driver skittered out of the front seat and came around and opened the door and took my arm . " My wife had five , " he said . " I 'll take the suitcase , Miss . Five , and never a minute 's trouble with any of them . " He rushed me in through the door and up to the desk . " Here , " he said to the desk clerk . " Pay me later , " he said to me , and fled . " Name ? " the desk clerk said to me politely , her pencil poised . " Name , " I said vaguely . I remembered , and told her . " Age ? " she asked . " Sex ? Occupation ? " " Writer , " I said . " Housewife , " she said . " Writer , " I said . " I 'll just put down housewife , " she said . " Doctor ? How many children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to now . " " Normal pregnancy ? " she said . " Blood test ? X-ray ? " " Look --  " I said . " Husband 's name ? " she said . " Address ? Occupation ? " " Just put down housewife , " I said . " I do n't remember his name , really . " " Legitimate ? " " What ? " I said . " Is your husband the father of this child ? Do you have a husband ? " " Please , " I said plaintively , " Can I go on upstairs ? " " Well , really , " she said , and sniffed . You 're only having a baby . " She waved delicately to a nurse , who took me by the same arm everybody else had been usiwv that morning , and in the elevator thisnurse was very nice . She asked me twice how I was feeling and said " Maternity ? " to me politely as we left the elevator ; I was carrying my own suitcase by then . T wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I got into the hospital nightgown . The nurses had all been to some occupational party the night before and one of them had been simply a riot ; she was still being a riot while I undressed , because every now and then one of the two other nurses would turn around to me and say , " Is n't she a riot , honestly ? " I made a few remarks , just to show that I too was light-hearted and not at all nervous ; I commented laughingly on the hospital nightgown , and asked with amusement tinged with foreboding what was the apparatus they were wheeling in on the tray . My doctor arrived about half an hour later ; he had obviously had three cups of coffee and a good cigar ; he patted me on the shoulder said , " How do we feel ? " " Pretty well , " I said , with an uneasy giggle that ended in a squawk . " How long do you suppose it will be before --  " " We do n't need to worry about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed pleasantly , and nodded to the nurses . They all bore down on me at once . One of them smoothed my pillow , one of them held my hand , and the third one stroked my forehead and said " After all , you 're only having a baby . " " Call me if you want me , " the doctor said to the nurses as he left . " I 'll be downstairs in the coffee shop . " " I 'll call you if I need you , " I told him ominously , and one of the nurses said in a honeyed voice , " Now , look , we do n't want our husband to get all worried . " I opened one eye : my husband was sitting , suddenly , beside the bed . He looked as though he were trying not to scream . ' ' They told me to come in here , " he said . " 1 i ? as trying to find the waiting room . " " The other end of the hall , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nurse came running . " Get him out of here , " I said , waving my head at my husband . " They told me --  " my husband began , looking miserably at the nurse . " It 's al-1-1-14-1 right , " the nurse said . She began to stroke my forehead again . " Hubby belongs right here . " " Either he goes or I go , " I said . The door slammed open and the doctor came in . " Heard you were here , " he said jovially , shaking my husband 's hand . " Look a little pale . " My husband smiled weakly . " Never lost a father yet , " the doctor said , and slapped him on the back . He turned to me . ' ' Flow do we feel ? " he said . " Terrible , " I said , and the doctor laughed again . " Just on my way downstairs , " he said to my husband . " Come along ? " No one seemed , actually , to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were there , open my eyes again and they were gone . This time , when I opened my eyes , a pleasant-faced nurse was standing beside me ; she was swabbing my arm with a piece of cotton . Although I am ordinarily timid about hypodermics I welcomed this one with what was almost a genuine echo of my old reassuring smile . " Well , well , " I said to the nurse . " Sure glad to see you . " " Sissy , " she said distinctly , and jabbed me in the arm . " How soon will this wear off ? " I asked her with deep suspicion ; I am always afraid with nurses that they feel that the psychological effect of a hypodermic is enough , and that I am actually being inoculated with some useless , although probably harmless , concoction . " You wo n't even notice , " she said enigmatically , and left . T HE hypodermic hit me suddenly , and I began to giggle about five minutes after she left . I was alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I opened my eyes and there was a woman standing beside the bed . She was human , not a nurse ; she was wearing a baggy blue bathrobe . " I 'm across the hall , " she said . " I been hearing you . " " I was laughing , " I said , with vast dignity . " I heard you , " she said . " Tomorrow it might be me , maybe . " " You here for a baby ? " " Someday , " she said gloomily " I was here two weeks ago , I was having pains . I come in the morning and that night they said to me , Go home , wait a while longer . ' So I went home , and I come again three dayslater , I was having pains . And they said to me , Go home , wait a while longer . ' And so yesterday I come again , I was having pains . So far they let me stay . " " That 's too bad , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She takes care of everything and sees the meals made , but she 's beginning to think I got her there with false pretenses . " " That 's too bad , " I said . I began to pound the wall with my fists . " Stop that , " she said . " Somebody 'll hear you . This is my third . The first two ? nothing . " " This is my third , " I said . " I do n't care who hears me . " " My kids , " she said . " Every time I come home they say to me , ' Where 's the baby ? ' My mother too . My husband , he keeps driving me over and driving we back . " " They kept telling me the third was the easiest , " I said . I began to giggle again . " There you go , " she said . " Laughing your head off . I wish I had something to laugh at . 1 .. HE waved her hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I opened my same weary eye and my husband was sitting comfortably in his chair . " I said , " he was saying loudly , " I said , ' Do you mind if I read ? ' " He had the New York Times on his knee . " Look , " I said . " Do I have anything to read ? Here 1 am , with nothing to do and no one to talk to and you sit there and read the New York Times right in front of me and here I am , with nothing ? " " How do we feel ? " the doctor asked . He was suddenly much taller than before and the walls of the room were rocking distinctly . " Doctor , " I said , and I believe that my voice was a little louder than I intended it should be . " You better give me --  " He patted me on the hand and it was my husband instead of the doctor . " Stop yelling , " he said . " I 'm not yelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . I 've changed my mind , I do n't want any baby , I want to go home and forget the whole thing . " " I know just how you feel , " he said . My only answer was a word which certainly I knew that I knew , although I had never honestly expected to hear it spoken in my own ladylike voice . " Stop yelling , " my husband said urgently . " Please stop saying that . " I had the idea that I was perfectly conscious , and I looked at him with dignity . " Who is doing this , " I asked . " You or me ? " " It 's all right , " the doctor said . " We 're on our way . " The walls were moving along on either side of me and the woman in the blue bathrobe was waving from a doorway . " She loved me for the dangers I had passed , " I said to the doctor , " and 1 loved her that she did pity them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " the doctor said . " Hold your breath .

Next time you must come to our --  " " It 's a girl , " the doctor said . " Sarah , " / said politely , as though I were introducing them .

The door was still open and a face peered around it . My husband , the doctor , and I , all turned happily to look . It was the woman in the blue bathrobe . " Had it yet ? " I asked her . " No , " she said . " You ? " " Yep , " I said . " You going home again ? " " Listen , " she said . " I been thinking .
