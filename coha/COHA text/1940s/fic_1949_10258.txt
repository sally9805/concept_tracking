My brain and heart were as empty as my belly , for I no longer believed in the gods . But when the week had passed , my head was anointed with oil , and having sworn the priestly oath , I was given a certificate . On this document was the great seal of the temple of Ammon and my name , and it entitled me to enter the House of Life . So we entered it , Mose , Belt , and I. Its gate was opened to us , and my name was inscribed in the Book of Life as my father Senmut 's name had been inscribed before me and his father 's name before him . But I was happy no longer . 4 In the I louse of Life , which was part of the great temple of Ammon , the teaching was supervised nominally by the royal physicians , each in his own branch . We saw them but seldom , however , for their prat- tices were large , they received costly presents from the wealthy , and they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any patient came to the House of Life whose sickness puzzled the ordinary doc- tors , or if these would not venture to undertake the cure , a royal physician would come to treat him and to demonstrate his proficiency before those who were specializing in his branch . Thus even the poorest sufferer might have the benefit of a royal physician 's care , to the glory of Ammon . The training period was a long one even for those with talent . We had to take a course on drugs and potions , learn the names and properties of herbs and the seasons and hours at which they must be gathered , and also dry them and make extracts from them ; for a physician must be able to prepare his own remedies at need . Many of us grumbled at this , not seeing the use of it , since by merely writing a prescription one could obtain from the House of Life all the known remedies correctly mixed and measured . Later , however , this knowl- edge was to stand me in good stead , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the different parts of the body , also the functions and purpose of every human organ . We learned to handle scalpel and forceps , hut above all we had to accustom our hands to recognize disease both through the natural orifices of the body and through the skin ; from the eyes also we had to detect the nature of a disorder . We must be able to deliver a woman in childbirth when the midwife 's help was of no avail . We must stimulate and alleviate pain as occasion required and learn to distinguish between trifling com- plaints and severe ones , between ailments of mental and physical 40 origin . We had to know truth from falsehood in the patients ' talk and what questions to ask in order to gain a clear picture of the complaint . The long period of probation was followed by the day when  --  after ceremonial purification  --  I was clothed in a white gown and started work in the reception hall , where I learned to draw teeth from the jaws of strong men , to bandage wounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was new to me ; thanks to my father 's teaching I made good progress and was promoted to the charge and instruction of my companions . Sometimes I received gifts such as are given to doctors , and I had my name engraved on the green stone that Neferneferneferhad given me so that I could set my seal below my prescriptions . I was put to ever more exacting tasks . I went on duty in the rooms where the incurably sick lay and attended renowned physicians at their treatments and at the operations , in which for every one that was cured ten died . I learned that death holds no terrors for a doctor and for the sick comes often as a merciful friend so that their faces after release are apt to be more serene than at any time during their life of drudgery . Yet I was blind and deaf until the day of awakening came as it had come in my childhood , when pictures , words , and letters sprang to life . Once more my eyes were opened , and I woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its joy because I asked myself " why ? " The dread key to all true knowledge is " why ? " It is mightier than the reed of Thoth , more potent than inscriptions in stone . It happened thus : A wife came to me who had had no children and who believed herself to be barren , for she was already forty years of age . But her monthly flow had ceased , and she was uneasy ; she came to the I-louse of Life because she feared that an evil spirit had taken possession of her and poisoned her body . As was prescribed in such cases , I planted grains of corn in some earth , watering half of them with Nile water and the rest with the woman 's urine . I then exposed the soil to the warmth of the sun and bade the woman return in two days . When she came again , the seeds had sprouted , those which had been watered with Nile water being small and the other shoots green and strong . What had been written of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rejoice , for holy Ammon in his grace has blessed yourwomb , and you shall bring forth a child like other favored women . " The poor soul wept for joy and gave me a silver bangle from her41wrist weighing two deben , ' for she had long ago given up hope . And as soon as she could believe me , she asked , " Is it a son ? " thinking me omniscient . I plucked up courage , looked her in the eye , and said , " It is a son . " For the chances were even and at that time my gambling luck was good . The woman rejoiced still more and gave me a bracelet from her other wrist , of two debcn weight . But when she had gone , I asked myself how it was possible for a grain of corn to know what no doctor could discover and know it before the eye could detect the signs of pregnancy ? Summoning up my resolution , I asked my teacher . He merely looked at me as if I were half-witted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this was no answer . I took courage again and asked the royal obstetrician in the maternity house . He said , " Ammon is chief of all the gods . His eye sees the womb that receives the seed ; if he permits germination , why should he not also allow corn to grow when moistened with water from the pregnant woman 's body ? " He , too , stared at me as if I were half-witted , but his was no answer . Then my eyes were opened , and I saw that the doctors in the House of Life knew the writings and the traditions but no more . If I asked why a festering wound must be burned while an ordinary one is merely dressed and bandaged and why boils are healed with mildew and cobwebs , they said only , " So it has always been . " In the same way a surgeon might perform the hundred and eighty-two operations and incisions prescribed , and perform them according to his experience and skill , well or badly , quickly or slowly , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because only these are described and illustrated in the books , and nothing else has ever been done . There were some cases in which the sufferer grew thin and pale , though the doctor could find in him no disease or injury ; he could be revived and cured by a diet of raw liver from the sacrificial beasts , bought at a high price , but one must on no account ask why . There were some who had pains in their bellies and whose hands and feet burned . They were given purges and narcotics ; some recovered , others perished , but no doctor could say beforehand who would live and whose belly would swell so that he died . No one knew why this was ; no one might seek to know . I soon noticed that I was asking too many questions , for people began to look at me askance , and those who had come after me were set in authority over me . Then I took off my white robe , cleaned myself , * A deben weighs approximately 31/ ounces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two silver rings that togetherweighed four deben. 5When I left the temple  --  a thing I had not done for years  --  I saw that while I had been working and studying Thebes had changed . I noted it as I walked along the Avenue of Rams and through the markets . There was restlessness everywhere ; people 's dress had become more elaborate and costly so that one could no longer distinguishmen from women by their wigs and pleated skirts . From wine shops and pleasure houses came shrill Syrian music ; foreign speech was heard in the streets , where Syrians and wealthy Negroes rubbed shoulders with Egyptians unabashed . The wealth and power of Egypt were immeasurable ; for centuries past no enemy had entered its cities , and men who had never known war had reached middle age . But I can not tell whether the people were any happier on this account , for their eyes were restless , their movements hurried , and they seemed always to be waiting impatiently for some new thing and could not be content with the day that was passing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rebelliousheart . On coming home , I found that my father Senmut had aged ; his back was bent , and he could no longer distinguish written characters . My mother Kipa was old also ; she panted as she moved and talked of nothing but her grave . For with his savings my father had bought a tomb in the City of the Dead on the west bank of the river . I had seen it : it was a handsome tomb built of mud bricks with the usual inscriptions and pictures on the walls , and all about it were hundreds and thousands of similar graves that the priests of Ammon sold to honest , thrifty folk at a high price  --  a price they paid to obtain immortality . I had written out a death book to be laid in their tomb so that they should not go astray on the long journey : a fine , fairly written book , though not adorned with colored pictures like those sold in the book court of Ammon 's temple . My mother gave me food , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found nothing to say to each other ; the house was strange to me , as were the street and the people in the street . My heart grew heavier still until I remembered the temple of Ptah and Thothmes who had been my friend and was to become an artist . I thought : I have four deben of silver in my pocket . I will seek out my friend43Thothmes , that we may rejoice together and make merry with wine , for I shall find no answer to my questions . So I took leave of my parents , saying that I must return to the House of Life , and shortly before sunset I found the temple of Ptah . Having learned from the porter where the art school lay , I entered and inquired for the student Thothmes ; only then did I hear that he had been expelled long ago . The students spat upon the ground before me when they spoke his name , because the teacher was present ; when he turned his back , they counseled me to go to a tavern called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay between the poor quarter and the rich and had an inscription over the door praising the wine from Ammon 's vineyard and also that from the harbor . Inside there were artists squatting on the floor drawing pictures while an old man sat in sad contemplation of the empty wine bowl before him . " Sinuhe , by all the potters ' wheels ! " cried someone , rising to greet me with his hands lifted in wonder . I recognized Thothmes , though his shoulder cloth was dirty and tattered and his eyes were bloodshot and there was a big bump on his forehead . He had grown older and thinner , and there were lines at the corners of his mouth , but his eyes still held that cheerful , impudent , irresistible glint , and he bent forwardtill our cheeks touched . I knew then that we were still friends . " My heart is heavy , " I said to him . " All is vanity , and I have sought you out so that we may rejoice our hearts with wine  --  for no one answers when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that he lacked the means to buy wine . " I carry four deben of silver on my wrists , " said I with pride . Thothmes then pointed at my head , which was still shaven because I wanted men to know that I was a priest of the first grade : it was all I had to be proud of . But now I was vexed that I had not let my hair grow and said impatiently , " I am a physician , not a priest . I think I read over the door that wine from the harbor can be had here ; let us see if it is good . " Thothmes ordered mixed wine , and a slave came to pour water over our hands and set roasted lotus seeds on a low table before us . The landlord himself brought the brightly colored goblets . Thothmes raised his , spilled a drop on the ground , and said , " For the divine Potter ! May the plague consume the art school and its teachers ! " And he ' recited the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goblet and let a drop fall on the ground . " In the name of Ammon ! May his boat leak to all eternity , may the bellies of his priests rupture , and may the pestilence destroy the ignorantteachers in the House of Life ! " But I said this in a low voice and looked about me lest a stranger should overhear my words . " Have no fear , " said Thothmes . " So many of Ammon 's ears have been boxed in this tavern that they have had enough of listening  --  and all of us here are lost already . I could not find even bread and beer if I had not hit upon the idea of making picture books for rich men 's children . " He showed me the scroll he had been working on when I came . I could not help laughing , for there he had drawn a fortress defended by a quaking , terrified cat against the onslaught of mice , also a hippopotamussinging in a treetop while a dove climbed painfully up the tree by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' brown eyes , but it faded as he unrolledthe papyrus further and disclosed the picture of a bald little priest leading a big Pharaoh on a rope to the temple , like a beast of sacrifice . Next he showed me a little Pharaoh bowing before a massive statue of Ammon . He nodded at my questioning look . " You see ? Grown people laugh at the pictures , too , because they 're so crazy . It is ridiculous for a mouse to attack a cat or a priest to lead a Pharaoh  --  but those who know begin to reflect upon a number of things . Therefore , I shall not lack for bread and beer  --  until the priests have me clubbed to death in the street . Such things have happened . " " Let us drink , " I said , and drink we did , but my heart was not gladdened . Presently I put my question to him . " Is it wrong to ask why ? " " Of course it is wrong , for a man who presumes to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of Kern . All must be as it has been  --  and you know it . I trembled with joy when I entered the art school  --  I was like a thirsty man who has found a spring , a hungry man clutching at bread . And I learned many fine things .... Oh , yes . I learned how to hold a pen and handle a chisel , how to model in wax what will be hewn from stone , how stone is polished , how colored stones are fitted together , and how to paint on alabaster . But when I longed to get to work and make such things as I had dreamed of , I was set to treading clay for others to handle . For high above everythingstands the convention . Art has its convention no less than writing , and he who breaks with it is damned . " From the beginning of time it has been laid down how one should represent a standing figure and how a sitting one , how a horse liftshis hooves , how an ox draws a sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever departs from it is unfit for the temple , and stone and chisel are denied him . 0 Sinuhe , my friend , I , too , have asked why  --  and only too often . That is why I sit here with bumps on my head . " We drank and grew merry , and my heart lightened as if a boil in it had been lanced , for I was no longer alone . " Sinuhe , my friend , we have been born into strange times . Everythingis melting  --  changing its shape  --  like clay on a potter 's wheel . Dress is changing , words , customs are changing , and people no longer believe in the gods  --  though they may fear them . Sinuhe , my friend , perhaps we were born to see the sunset of the world , for the world is already old , and twelve hundred years have passed since the building of the pyramids . When I think of this , I want to bury my head in my hands and cry like a child . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine in brightly colored goblets , and each time the landlord of the Syrian Jar refilled them he bowed and stretched forth his hands at knee level . From time to time a slave came to pour water over our hands . My heart grew light as a swallow on the threshold of winter ; I could have declaimed verse and taken the whole world into my arms . " Let us go to a pleasure house , " said Thothmes laughing . " Let us hear music and watch girls dancing and gladden our hearts  --  let us not ask why ' any more or demand that our cup be full . " We walked along the streets . The sun had set , and I met for the first time that Thebes where it is never night . In this flaring , noisy quarter torches flamed before the pleasure houses , and lamps burned on columns at the street corners . Slaves ran here and there with carryingchairs , and the shouts of runners mingled with the music from the houses and the roarings of the drunk . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and I was a little scared . The one to which Thothmes led me was called the Cat and Grapes . It was a pretty little house , full of soft , golden lamplight . There were soft mats to sit on , and young  --  and in my eyes lovely  --  girls beat time to the music of flutes and strings . When the music stopped , they sat with us and begged me to buy them wine , as their throats were as dry as chaff . Then two naked dancers performed a complicated dance requiring great skill , and I followed it with interest . As a doctor I was accustomed to the sight of naked girls and yet had never seen breasts swaying or little bellies and bottoms moving so seductively as these . But the music saddened me again , and I began to long for I knew not what . A beautiful girl took my hand and pressed her side to mine and said my eyes were those of a wise man . But her eyes were not as green as the Nile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it left her bosom bare , was not of royal linen . So I drank wine and neither looked into her eyes nor felt any wish to call her " my sister , " or take pleasure with her . And the last I remember of that place is a vicious kick from a Negro and a lump I got on my head when I fell down the steps . So it came about just as my mother Kipa had foretold : I lay in the street without a copper piece in my pocket until Thothmes drew my arm over his strong shoulder and led me to the jetty , where I could drink my fill of Nile water and bathe my face and my hands and my feet . That morning I entered the House of Life with swollen eyes and a smarting lump on my head , a dirty shoulder cloth , and without the smallest wish to ask , " Why ? " I was to be on duty among the deaf and those with ear diseases , so I washed myself quickly and put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who began to upbraid me in phrases I had read in the books and knew by heart . " What is to become of you if you run along the walls by night and drink without keeping tally of your cups ? What is to become of you if you idle away your time in pleasure houses , smiting wine jars with your stick to the alarm of honest citizens ? What is to become of you if you shed blood and run from the watchmen ? " But when he had done his duty , he smiled to himself with relief , took me to his room , and gave me a potion to cleanse my stomach . My spirits rose as I realized that wine and pleasure houses were winked at in the House of Life provided one stopped asking why. 6So , I , too , was smitten with Thebes fever and began to love the night more than the day , the flickering of torches more than sunlight , Syrian music more than the moans of the sick , and the whispering of pretty girls more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had anything to say against this as I fulfilled my tasks in the House of Life , satisfied my examiners , and kept a steady hand . It was all part of the initiate 's life ; few students could afford to set up house on their own and marry during their training , and my teacher gave me to understand that I would do well to sow my wild oats , give rein to mybody , and be of a merry heart . But I meddled with no woman though I thought I knew that their bodies did not really burn worse than fire . The times were full of unrest , and great Pharaoh was ill . I saw his shriveled old man 's face when he was carried to the temple at the autumn festival adorned with gold and precious stones , motionless as a statue with his head bowed beneath the weight of the double crown . The physicians could not longer help him ; rumor had it that his days were numbered and that his heir would soon succeed him  --  and the heir was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices in the temple of Ammon , and Ammon could not help his divine son though Pharaoh Amenhotep III had built for him the mightiest temple of all time . It was said that the King had grown wroth with the Egyptian gods and that he had sent swift messengers to his father-in-law , the king of Mitanni in Nahara , desiring that the miracle-working Ishtar of Niniveh be sent to heal him . But to the joy of the priests even foreign gods could not cure Pharaoh . When the river began to rise , the royal skull surgeon was summoned to the palace . In all the time I had been in the House of Life I had not once seen Ptahor , for trepanning was rare and during my training period I had not been allowed to attend the specialists at their treatments and operations . Now the old man was carried in haste from his villa to the House of Life , and I was careful to be at hand when he entered the purifying room . He was as bald as ever , his face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his discontented old mouth . He recognized me , smiled and said , " Ah , is it you , Sinuhe ? Have you come so far , son of Senmut ? " He handed me a black wooden box in which he kept his instruments and bade me follow him . This was an unmerited honor that even a royal physician might have envied me , and I bore myself accordingly . " I must test the steadiness of my hand , " said Ptahor , " and open a skull or two here , to see how it goes . " His eyes were watery , and his hand trembled slightly . We went into a room in which lay incurables , paralytics , and those with head injuries . Ptahor examined a few and chose an old man for whom death would come as a release , also a strong slave who had lost his speech and the use of his limbs from a blow on the head in a street brawl . They were given narcotics to drink and were then taken to the operatingtheater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fire . My task was to shave the heads of both patients with the keenest of razors . Then the heads were cleaned and washed once more , the scalps massaged with a numbing salve , and Ptahor was ready for his work . First he made an incision in the scalp of the old man and pushed the edges back regardless of the copious flow of blood . Then with swift movements he bored a hole in the bared skull with a large tubular bore and lifted out the circle of bone . The old man began to groan , and his face turned blue . " I see nothing the matter with his head , " said Ptahor . He replaced the bit of bone , stitched the edges of the scalp together , and bandaged the head ; whereupon the old man gave up the ghost . " My hands appear to tremble somewhat , " remarked Ptahor . " Perhapsone of the young men would bring me a cup of wine . " The onlookers , besides the teachers in the House of Life , consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Ptahor had had his wine , he turned his attention to the slave , who had been bound and drugged , yet still sat savagely glowering at us . Ptahor asked that he might be bound yet more firmly and that his head might be gripped in a vice that not even a giant could have shifted . He then opened up the scalp and this time was careful to stanch the flow of blood . The veins at the edges of the incision were cauterized and the blood stopped by special medicaments . Ptahor let other doctors do this , to spare his own hands . In the House of Life there was as a rule a " blood stancher , " a man of no education whose mere presence would stop a flow of blood in a short time , but Ptahor wished this to be a demonstration and desired also to save his strength for Pharaoh . When Ptahor had cleansed the outside of the skull , he pointed out to us the place where the bone had been crushed in . By means of bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull as large as the palm of one 's hand and then showed us how clotted blood had gathered among the white convolutions of the brain . With infinite care he removed the blood bit by bit and freed a bone splinter that had been forced into the brain substance . This operation took some time , so each pupil could follow his movements and impress the look of a brain upon his own memory . Next Ptahor closed the opening with a plate of silver that had been prepared meanwhile to correspond in shape to the piece of bone that had been removed and fixed it firmly in position with tiny clips . Then he stitched the edges of the wound together , bandaged it , and said , " Wake him . " For the patient had long ago lost consciousness . The slave was freed from his bonds , wine was poured down his throat , and he was given strong drugs to inhale . Presently he sat upand let forth a stream of curses . It was a miracle no one who had not witnessed it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unable to move his limbs . This time I had no need to ask why , for Ptahor explained that the bone splinter and the blood on the surface of the brain had been the cause of the symptoms . " If he is not dead within three days , he is cured , " said Ptahor . " In two weeks he will be able to thrash the man who stoned him . I do not think he will die . " With friendly courtesy he thanked all who had helped him , naming me among them , though I had but handed him his instruments as they were needed . I had not understood his purpose in this , but in giving me his ebony box to carry he had singled me out to be his assistant in Pharaoh 's palace . I had now served him at two operations and was therefore experienced and more useful to him than even the royal physicians where the opening of a skull was concerned . I did not understand this and was amazed when he said , " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ready , Sinuhe ? " Wrapped in my simple doctor 's mantle , I stepped up beside him in the carrying chair . The blood stancher sat on one of the poles , and Pharaoh 's slaves ran with us to the landing stage , at so smooth a pace that the chair never swayed . Pharaoh 's ship awaited us , manned by picked slaves who rowed swiftly : we seemed rather to fly over the water than float upon it . From Pharaoh 's landing stage we were borne rapidly to the golden house . I did not wonder at our haste , for soldiers were alp'eady marching along the streets of Thebes , gates were being closed , and merchants were carrying their goods into the warehouses and closing doors and shutters . It was clear from this that Pharaoh was soon to die . BOOK 3Thebes Fever50IA GREAT concourse of people from every walk of life had gathered by the walls of the golden house , and even the forbidden foreshore was thronged with boats -- the wooden rowing boats of the rich and the pitched-reed boats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran through the crowd like the rushing of distant waters , and the news that the royal skull surgeon was on his way sped from mouth to mouth . Then the people held up their hands in grief , while cries and lamentations followed us up to the palace ; for everyone knew that no Pharaoh had ever lived until the third sunrise after his skull had been opened . Through the gate of lilies we were taken to the royal apartments ; court chamberlains were our servants and prostrated themselves before us , for we carried death in our hands . A temporary cleansing room had been prepared , but after exchanging a few words with Pharaoh 's own physician , Ptahor raised his hands in sorrow and performed the cleansingceremonial in but a perfunctory manner . The sacred fire was borne after us , and having passed through a series of splendid rooms , we entered the royal bedchamber . Great Pharaoh lay beneath a golden canopy ; the bedposts were protectinggods , and the bedstead was supported by lions . His swollen body was naked , stripped of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aged head hung sideways , and he breathed stertoriously , saliva running from the corner of his mouth . So shadowy and ephemeral is mortal glory that he could not have been distinguished from any of the old men who lay dying in the reception hall of the House of Life . But on the walls of the room he was depicted as speedingin a chariot drawn by swift , plumed horses ; his powerful arm drew back the bowstring , and lions , pierced by his arrows , fell dead about his feet . We prostrated ourselves before him , knowing  --  as all who had seen death must know  --  that Ptahor 's arts were useless here . But since throughout the ages the skull of Pharaoh has been opened as a last resort , if natural death has not already supervened , it must be opened53now , and we set about our task . I lifted the lid of the ebony box and in the flame purified once more the scalpels , bores , and forceps . The court physician had already shaved and washed the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood to sit upon the bed and take Pharaoh 's head in his hands . Then the royal consort Taia stepped to the bed and forbade him . Hitherto she had stood by the wall with her arms raised in the gesture of grief , motionless as an image . Behind her stood the young heir to the throne , Amenhotep , and his sister Baketamon , but I had not yet dared to raise my eyes to them . Now that a stir ran through the room I looked , and recognized them from the statues in the temples . The prince was of my own age but taller . Princess Baketamon had noble and very lovely features and large , oval eyes . But more majestic than either was the royal consort Taia , though she was short and plump . Her complexion was very dark and her cheekbones broad and prominent . It was said that by birth she was a woman of the people and had Negro blood in her veins ; I do not know if this is so , for it is but hearsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no honorable titles in the records , yet her eyes were intelligent , bold , and piercing , and her whole bearing radiated power . When she moved her hand and looked upon the stancher of blood , he seemed dust beneath her broad , brown feet . I understood her feelings , for the fellow was an ox driver of low birth and could neither read nor write . He stood with bent head and hanging arms , with his mouth open and a vacant expression on his face . Unskilled , untalented though he was , he yet had the power to stop the flow of blood by his mere presence . Therefore he had been called from his plow and his oxen to be paid his fee in the temple , and despite all cleansing ceremonial the smell of cattle dung clung about him . He himself could not account for his powers . He possessed them , as a jewel may be found in a clod of earth , and they were such as can not be acquired through study or spiritual exercises . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen . " I will hold the god 's head if it be needful . " Ptahor protested that the task was an unpleasant and bloody one ; nevertheless , she took her place on the edge of the bed and most carefullyraised the head of her dying husband into her lap , heedless of the saliva that dripped onto her hands . " He is mine , " she said , " and no one else shall touch him . It is from my arms that he shall enter the realms of death . " " He shall step aboard the ship of his father the sun , " said Ptahor , incising the scalp with his flint knife . " Of the sun was he born , to the54sun shall he return , and all people shall praise his name from everlastingto everlasting  --  In the name of Set and all devils , what is the blood stancher about ? " He had been talking to distract the Queen 's thoughts from the operation , as a skillful doctor will talk to a patient to whom he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peasant , who was leaning against the door post with sleepy , half-shut eyes . Sluggish blood had begun to well from Pharaoh 's head and run down into his consort 's lap so that she flinched and her face turned a yellowish gray . The man roused himself from his thoughts  --  thoughts no doubt of his oxen and his irrigation ditches  --  remembered his duty , and approaching the bed , he looked at Pharaoh and raised his hands . The flow of blood ceased at once , and I washed and cleaned the head . " Forgive me , my little lady , " said Ptahor , taking the bore from my hand . " To the sun  --  ay , indeed , straight to his father in the golden ship , the blessing of Ammon be upon him . " While he was speaking , he spun the bore swiftly and deftly between his hands so that it grated its way into the bone . The prince opened his eyes , took a step forward , and his face quivered as he said , " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in Aton . " " Ay , indeed , Aton , " murmured Ptahor soothingly . " Aton , of course  --  a slip of the tongue . " He took his flint knife again and the ebonyhandledhammer , and with light taps began to remove the piece of bone . " For I remember that in his divine wisdom he raised up a temple to Aton . That was surely soon after the prince 's birth , was it not , fair Taia ? One moment . " He glanced uneasily at the prince , who was standing by the bed with clenched fists and twitching face . " A mouthful of wine would steady my hand and do the prince no harm . At such a time as this one might well break the seal of a royal jar . There ! " I handed him the forceps , and he jerked out the piece of bone with a grating noise . " A little light , Sinuhe ! " Ptahor heaved a sigh , for the worst was over , and so did I. The same feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his limbs stirred , his breathing grew slower , and he sank into a yet deeper coma . Ptahor contemplated Pharaoh 's brain thoughtfullyin the bright light , where it lay exposed : it was grayish blue , and it quivered. 55 " Hm , " he said musingly . " What is done is done . May his Aton do the rest for him , for this is a matter for gods , not men . " Lightly and carefully he fitted the piece of bone back into place , smearing size into the crack , drew together the edges of the wound , and bandaged it . The royal consort laid his head over a neck rest of rare wood and looked at Ptahor . Blood had dried upon her , but she did not heed it . Ptahor met her fearless gaze without making obeisance , and said in a low voice , " He will live until dawn , his god permitting . " Then he raised his hands in a gesture of sorrow , and so did I. But when he raised them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for who was I to pity royalty ? I purified the instruments in fire and put them back in the ebony box . " Your reward shall be great , " said the Queen , and she signed to us that we might go . A meal had been prepared for us in another room , and Ptahor looked with delight at the many wine jars that stood along the wall . Having closely examined the seal of one of these , he caused it to be opened , and a slave poured water over our hands . When were were alone again , Ptahor explained to me that RaHerachtewas the god of the Amenhoteps and that Aton was his manifestation : a god of great antiquity , older indeed than Ammon . " It is said that the present heir to the throne is the divine son of this Aton , " went on Ptahor . He took a draught of wine . " It was in the temple of Ra-Herachte that the royal consort saw her vision , after which she bore a son . She took with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Eie , and he saw to it that his wife was engaged as wet nurse to the heir . His daughter Nefertiti drank milk from the same breasts as the prince and played with him in the palace like a sister , so you may fancy what will come of that . " Ptahor drank again , sighed , and went on . " Ah , for an old man there is nothing more delightful than drinking wine and gossiping about what does not concern him . If you but knew , Sinuhe , how many secrets lie buried behind this old forehead . Perhaps there are kingly secrets among them . Many wonder why it is that no son has ever been born alive in the women 's wing of the palace , for that is against all medical law  --  and the man lying there with the opened skull was no milksop , either , in the days of his joy and strength . He found his consorton a hunting trip ; they say Taia was the daughter of some fowler and dwelt among the reeds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of her wisdom and venerated her parents , too , and filled their tomb with the costliest of gifts . Taia had nothing against his56pleasures so long as the women of the harem bore no man children . In this she had wonderfully good fortune , such as one could hardly believe possible if it had not happened . " Ptahor looked sideways at me and glancing round said quickly , " But , Sinuhe , never believe any stories you may hear ; they are only put about by ill-natured people  --  and everyone knows how gentle the queen is and how wise and what a gift she has for gathering useful men about her . Yes , yes ... " I led Ptahor out into the fresh air ; night had fallen , and in the east the lights of Thebes outshone the red glow in the sky . I was flushed with wine and felt again the city 's fever in my blood . Stars twinkled above my head , and the garden was filled with the scent of flowers . " Ptahor , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night sky , then  --  then I thirst after love ! " " There is no love , " said Ptahor emphatically . " A man is sad when he has no woman to lie with , and when he has lain with one , he is still sadder . So it has ever been and ever will be . " " Why ? " " Not even the gods know that . And never talk to me of love unless you want me to open your skull for you . I will do that for nothing and without requiring the smallest present from , you and so save you much sorrow . " It now seemed best for me to take upon myself the duties of a slave ; I lifted him in my arms and carried him to the room that had been put at our disposal . He was so little and old that I was not even breathless . When I had lain him down upon the bed , he fell asleep at once , after some little groping for a wine cup . I covered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went out again to the terrace of flowers  --  for I was young , and youth desires no sleep on the night of a king 's death . The murmuring voices of those who were passing the night by the palace walls reached the terrace like the distant sough of wind through r ushes . I awoke amid the scent of flowers as the lights of Thebes glowed a garish red against the eastern sky ; I remembered a pair of eyes green as Nile waters in the heat of summer  --  and found I was no longer alone . The light from the stars and from the thin sickle of the moon was so faint that I could not see whether a man or a woman was approaching , but someone drew near and peered into my face . I stirred , and the57newcomer , in a voice of authority that was yet shrill  --  almost childish  --  demanded , " Is it the Lonely One ? " I recognized the prince 's voice and his lanky figure and prostrated myself before him not daring to speak . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , you fool . No one can see us , so you need not bow to me . Keep that for the god whose son I am  --  for there is but one , and all others are his manifestations . Did you know that ? " Without waiting for an answer he added reflectively , " All others but Ammon , who is a false god . " I made a gesture of protest and said , " Oh ! " to show I feared such talk . " Let be ! " he said . " I saw you standing by my father , handing knife and hammer to that crazy old Ptahor . So I called you the Lonely One . To Ptahor my mother gave the name of Old Monkey . You must bear these names if you have to die before leaving the palace . But I thought of yours . " I thought he must be mad to talk thus wildly , though Ptahor had said that we must die if Pharaoh did , and the stancher of blood believed it . My hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . The prince was panting ; his hands twitched , and he mumbled to himself : " Restless . . . I would be  --  I would be in some other place . It is my god revealing himself . I know it  --  I fear it . Stay with me , Lonely One . He crushes my body with his strength , and my tongue is afflicted .... " I trembled , thinking him delirious . But he said to me in a commandingvoice , " Come ! " and I followed him . He led me down from the terrace and past Pharaoh 's lake , while from behind the walls came the murmuring voices of the mourners . I was in great dread , for Ptahor had stated that we might not leave the palace before the death of the king , but I could not gainsay the prince . He held his body tense and walked with such rapid , jerky steps that I had hard work to keep up with him . He was wearing only a loincloth , and the moon shone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs . It shone on his prominent ears and the tormented , agitated face that seemed to tell of some vision he alone could see . When we reached the shore , he said , " We will take a boat . I am going eastward to meet my father . " Without hesitating to choose his craft , he stepped into the nearest ; I followed him , and we began to row across . No one sought to hinder us , though we had stolen the boat . The night was uneasily astir ; other58craft were out on the river , and the red glow of Thebes showed ever brighter in the sky ahead . When we reached the farther shore , he set the boat adrift and started to walk forward as if he had been this way many times before . Others were abroad also , and we went unchallengedby the watch . Thebes knew that the king would die that night . The pace was wearing him out . Yet I wondered at the toughness of that young body , for though the night was cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The stars moved across the heavens , and the moon went down , and still he walked until we came up out of die valley into the desert , leaving Thebes behind us . The three hills in the east  --  the city 's guardians  --  loomed before us black against the sky . At last he sank down panting in the sand and said in a frightened voice , " Hold my hands , Sinuhe , for they tremble , and my heart thuds against my ribs . The hour draws near  --  it draws near for the world is desolate  --  you and I are alone . Where I go , you can not follow  --  and I do not want to be alone . " I gripped his wrists and felt that his whole twitching frame was bathed in cold sweat . The world about us was indeed desolate ; far off some jackal howled for a death ; slowly the stars paled and space about us turned a wan gray . Suddenly he shook off my hands and rising lifted his face to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said softly , with awe in his distracted , blazing face . " The god is coming . " Then again in a loud voice he shouted into the desert , " The god is coming ! " The air grew brighter , the hills before us flamed gold , and the sun rose  --  and with a shrill cry he sank swooning to the ground , his mouth moving , his limbs twitching convulsively and churning up the sand . But I was no longer afraid , for I had beard such cries in the forecourt of the House of Life and knew what to do . Lacking a peg to wedge between his teeth , I tore a strip from my loincloth , rolled it up , and stuffed it into his mouth . Then I began to massage his limbs . He would he sick and dazed when he awoke . I looked about me for help , but Thebes lay behind us , and not the meanest hovel was in sight . At that instant a falcon flew past me with a screech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arc above us , then sank again , and made as if to alight upon the prince 's forehead . Startled , I instinctively made the holy sign of Ammon ; had the prince had Horus in his mind when he greeted his god , and was Horus here manifest ? The boy moaned , and I bent to tend him . When I raised my head again , it seemed that the bird had taken human shape . Before me stood a young59man , godlike , beautiful in the sun 's rays . He carried a spear and wore the coarse shoulder cloth of a poor man . Though I did not believe in the gods , for safety 's sake I prostrated myself before him . " What 's this ? " he asked in the dialect of the Lower Kingdom . " Is the lad sick ? " Feeling very foolish , I rose to my knees and greeted him in the ordinary way . " If you are a robber , " I said , " you 'll get little from us , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for your help . " He screeched like a hawk , and the bird fell from the air to alight upon his shoulder . " I am Horemheb , son of the falcon , " he said proudly . " My parents are but cheese makers , but it was foretold at my birth that I should win command over many . The falcon flew before me , and I followed , having found no shelter for the night in the city . Thebes is shy of spears after dark . But I mean to enter Pharaoh 's service as a warrior . They say he is sick , therefore he may need strong arms to protect his sovereignty . " The prince moaned , passed his hands gropingly over his face , and contorted his limbs . I removed the rag from his mouth , wishing I had water with which to revive him . Horemheb surveyed him and asked coolly , " Is he dying ? " " He is not , " I replied impatiently . " He has the holy sickness . " Horemhcb gripped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not despise me though I come barefoot and am poor . I can write passably and read what is written , and I shall have command over many . Which god has taken possession of him ? " The people believe that a god speaks through those suffering from the holy sickness , hence his question . " He has his own god , " I answered , " and I think he is a little queerin the head . " " He is cold . " Horemheb drew off his cloak and spread it over the prince . " Morning in Thebes is chilly , but my own blood suffices to keep me warm . My god is Horns . This is surely a rich man 's son , for his skin is white and delicate , and he has never worked with his hands . And who are you ? " " A physician and initiate of the first grade of priesthood in Ammon 's temple in Thebes . " The heir to the throne sat up , moaned , and looked dazedly about him . His teeth chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant was as a cycle of time  --  I was ageless  --  hestretched forth a thousand hands above my head in benediction , and in every hand the symbol of eternal life . Must I not then believe ? " At the sight of Horemheb his eyes cleared , and he was beautiful in his radiant wonder . " Is it you whom Aton , the one god , has sent ? " " The falcon flew before me , and I followed ; that is why I am here . I know no more than that . " The prince looked with a frown at the other 's weapon . " You carry a spear , " he said in rebuke . Horemheb held it forth . " The shaft is of choice wood , " he said . " Its copper head longs to drink the blood of Pharaoh 's enemies . My spear is thirsty , and its name is Throat Slitter . " " Not blood ! " cried the prince . " Blood is an abomination to Aton . There is nothing more terrible than flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them strong ; it makes the gods fat and contented . As long as there is war , so long must blood Row . " " There will never be war again , " declared the heir to the throne . Horemheb laughed . " The lad 's daft ! War there has always been and always will be , forthe nations must test each other 's worth if they are to survive . " " All peoples are his children  --  all languages  --  all complexions  --  theblack land and the red . " The prince was gazing straight into the sun . " I shall raise temples to him in every land , and to the princes of those nds I shall send the symbol of life  --  for I have seen him ! Of him as I born and to him I shall return . " " He is mad , " said Horemheb to me , shaking his head in compassion . I can see he needs a doctor . " The prince raised his hand in greeting to the sun , and his face was cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking into other world . We let him finish his prayer and then began to lead m toward the city . He made no resistance . The fit had left him weak ; staggered and moaned as he went ; so at last we carried him between us , and the falcon flew ahead . When we came to the edge of cultivation , we saw a royal carrying'hair awaiting us . The slaves had lain down upon the ground , and outof the chair stepped a fat priest whose head was shaven and whoserk face was grave and beautiful . I stretched forth my hands at kneecl before him , for I took him to be Fie , of whom Ptahor had spoken. t he did not heed me . He threw himself prostrate before the princeand hailed him as king , so I knew that Amenhotep III was dead . The slaves then hastened to tend the new Pharaoh . His limbs were washed , massaged , and anointed , he was robed in royal linen , and upon his head was set the royal headdress . Meanwhile Eie spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinuhe ? " " He met his god , and I watched over him that no evil might befall . How do you know my name ? " He smiled . " It is for me to know all that goes on within the palace walls . I know your name and that you are a physician and that I might therefore entrust him to your care . You are also one of Ammon 's priests and have sworn him your oath . " There was a hint of menace in his tone as he said this . Throwing out my hands , I exclaimed , " What signifies an oath to Ammon ? " " You are right and have nothing to repent of . And this spearman ? " He pointed to Horemheb , who was standing apart , testing the spear point on his hand , with the falcon perched upon his shoulder . " It were better perhaps that he should die , " he added , " for Pharaoh 's secrets are shared by few . " " He covered Pharaoh with his cloak when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharaoh 's enemies . I believe he will be more useful to you alive than dead , priest Eie . " Eie threw a gold ring from his arm toward him , saying carelessly , " You may call upon me some time at the golden house , spearman . " But Horemheb let the gold ring fall in the sand at his feet and looked defiantly at Eie . " I take my orders from Pharaoh , and if I am not mistaken , Pharaoh is he who bears the royal headdress . The falcon led me to him , and that is sign enough . " Eie remained unruffled . " Gold is costly and is always of use , " he remarked . He picked up the gold ring and put it back upon his arm . " Make your obeisance to Pharaoh , but you must lay aside your spear in his presence . " The prince stepped forward . His face was pale and drawn but lighted still by a secret ecstasy that warmed my heart . " Follow me , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , for the truth has been revealed to me . " We walked with him to the chair , though Horemheb mumbled to himself , " Truth lies in my spear . " The porters set off at a trot to where the boat awaited us alongside the landing stage . We returned as we had come , unobserved , though the people stood packed outside the palace walls. 62We were allowed to enter the prince 's room , and he showed us big Cretan jars upon which were painted fish and other creatures . Word came that the Queen Mother was on her way to make her obeisance to him , so he gave us leave to go , promising to remember us both . When we had left him , Horemheb said to me in perplexity , " I am at a loss . I have nowhere to go . " " Stay here with an easy mind , " I counseled him . " He promised to remember you , and it is as well to be at hand when he does . The gods are capricious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with these flies ? " he demanded , pointing to the courtiers who were swarming at the prince 's door . " No , I have good reason to be uneasy , " he went on somberly . " What is to become of an Egypt whose ruler is afraid of blood and believes that all nations and languages and colors are of equal merit ? I was born a warrior , and my warrior sense tells me that such notions bode ill for such a man as I. " We parted , and I bade him ask for me at the House of Life if ever he needed a friend . Ptahor was waiting for me in our room , red eyed and irritable . " You were absent when Pharaoh drew his last breath at dawn , " he growled . " You were absent , and I slept ; and neither of us was there to see Pharaoh 's soul fly from his nostrils straight into the sun , like a bird . " I told him what had happened that night , and he raised his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Pharaoh is mad . " " I think not , " said I doubtfully . " I think he has knowledge of a new god . When his head has cleared , we may see wonders in the land of Kern . " " Ammon forbid ! Pour me out some wine , for my throat is as dry as roadside dust . " Shortly after this we were conveyed under guard to a pavilion in the I louse of Justice , where the Keeper of the Seal read the law to us from a leather scroll and told us that we must die since Pharaoh did not recover after his skull had been opened . I looked at Ptahor , but he only smiled when the executioner stepped forward with his sword . " Let the stancher of blood go first , " he said . " He is in a greater hurry than we are , for his mother is already preparing pease pottage for him iii the Western Land . " The stancher of blood took a warm farewell of us , made the holy sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leather63 scrolls . The executioner swung his sword in a great arc above the head of the condemned man , till it sang in the air , but stopped short as the edge just touched the back of his neck . But the blood stancher fell to the floor , and we thought he had swooned from terror , for there was not the smallest scratch upon him . When my turn came , I knelt with- out fear ; the executioner laughed and touched my neck with his blade without troubling to frighten me more . Ptahor considered he was too short to be required to kneel , and the executioner swung his sword over his neck , too . So we died , the law was accomplished , and we were given new names engraved in heavy gold rings . In Ptahor 's ring was written " I lc Who Is Like a Baboon " and in mine " He Who Is Alone . " Then Ptahor 's present was weighed out to him in gold and mine also , and we were clad in new robes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal linen and a collar heavy with silver and precious stones . When the servants tried to lift the blood stancher and revive him , they found him stone dead . I saw this with my own eyes and can vouch for its truth . But why he died I do not know , unless from the mere expecta- tion . Simple though he may be , a man who can arrest the flow of blood is not like other men . I-Ienceforth , being officially dead , I could not sign my name as Sinuhe without adding He Who Is Alone , and at court I could be known by no other name. 3 When I went back to the House of Life in my new clothes and with the gold ring on my arm , my teachers bowed before me . Yet I was still a pupil and had to write a detailed account of Pharaoh 's operation and death , attesting it with my name . I spent much time over this and ended with a description of the soul of Pharaoh flying from his nostrils in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later I had the satisfaction of hearing my report read to the people on each of the seventy days during which Pharaoh 's body was being prepared for immortality . During the whole of this period of mourning all pleasure houses , wine shops , and taverns in Thebes were closed so that to buy wine or hear music one had to enter by the back door . But when these seventy days had passed , I learned that I was now a qualified physician and might start to practice in whatever quarter of the city I chose . If on the other hand I preferred to pursue my studies in one or other of the special branches  --  among the dentists or ear doctors , 64 for instance , or the obstetricians , layers-on-of-hands , surgeons , or in any other of the fourteen different subjects in which instruction was given at the House of Life  --  I need only choose my branch . This was a special mark of favor , testifying how amply Ammon rewarded his ; crvants . I was young , and the learning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had been seized with the fever of Thebes ; I desired wealth : md fame ; I desired to profit by the period of my fame among the people . With the gold I had received I purchased a small house on the outskirtsof the fashionable quarter , furnished it according to my means , and bought a slave  --  a scraggy fellow with one eye , but good enough for me . His name was Kaptah . He assured me that his one eye was my good fortune , for now he could tell my would-be patients in the waiting room that he had been stone blind when I had bought him and that I had given him back partial sight . I had pictures painted on the walls of the waiting room . In one of these Imhotep the Wise , the god of doctors , was shown giving me instruction . I was painted small before him , as the custom is , but below the picture was an inscription that ran thus : Wisest and most skillful of thy disciples is Sinuhe , Son of Senmut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sacrifice to Ammon , that I might be seen to do him honor and win the confidence of my patients . lint in a third , great Pharaoh looked down upon me from the heavens iii the shape of a bird , while his servants weighed out gold for me and clothed me in new robes . I commissioned Thothmes to do these paintings for me although he was not an authorized artist and his name did not appear in the book in the temple of Ptah . But he was my friend , and because of his work those who looked upon the pictures for the first time raised their hands in astonishment , saying , " In truth he inspires faith , this Sinuhe , son of Senmut , He Who Is Alone , and will surely cure all his patients by Ins skill . " When all was ready , I sat down to await the sick . I sat for a long time , but none came . In the evening I went to a wine shop , having still a little gold and silver left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself a clever doctor ; I had no misgivings about the future and together with Thothmes made good cheer over my wine . In loud voices we discussed the affairs of the Two Kingdoms , for everywhere  --  in the market , before the merchants ' houses , in the taverns and pleas-65ure houses  --  such matters were vigorously debated by all at this time . It had come to pass as the old Keeper of the Seal had foretold . When the body of great Pharaoh had been made proof against death and attended to its resting place in the Valley of the Kings , where the doors of the tomb had been sealed with the royal seal , the Queen Mother ascended the throne bearing in her hands the scourge and the crook . Upon her chin was the beard of sovereignty and the lion 's tail was about her waist . The heir was not yet crowned Pharaoh , and it was said that he desired to purify himself and perform his devotions to the gods before he assumed power . But when the Queen Mother dismissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown priest , to honor at her right hand so that he surpassed in rank all the illustrious men of Egypt  --  then the temple of Ammon hummed like a beehive , there were ill omens , and misfortune attended the royal sacrifices . The priests interpreted many strange dreams that men had had . Winds veered from their usual quarter against all the laws of nature , and there was rain for two days running in the land of Egypt . Merchandise standing at the wharves suffered damage , and grain rotted . Certain pools on the outskirts of Thebes were turned to blood , and many went to see them . But the people were not yet afraid , for such things had happened in every age when the priests were angered . Though there was unrest and much empty talk , the mercenaries at the barracks  --  Egyptians , Syrians , Negroes , and Shardanas  --  were given lavish presents by the Queen Mother , and good order was maintained . The might of Egypt was undisputed ; in Syria it was upheld by the garrisons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaza  --  who in their childhood had dwelt at Pharaoh 's feet and grown up in the golden house  --  mourned his death as if he had been their father , and wrote letters to the Queen in which they declared themselves dust beneath her feet . The King of the land of Mitanni , in Naharani , sent his daughter as a bride to the new Pharaoh as his father had done before him and as had been agreed with the celestial Pharaoh before his death . Tadukhipa , for such was her name , arrived in Thebes with servants and slaves and asses laden with merchandise of great value . She was a child just six years old , and the prince took her to wife , for the kingdom of Mitanni was a wall between the wealth of Syria and the lands of the north , and guarded the caravan routes all the way from the land of the twin rivers to the sea . Rejoicing ceased among the priests of Sekhmet , the celestial daughter of Ammon , and the hinges of her temple gates were rusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ; we rejoiced our heartswith wine as we listened to Syrian music and watched the dancing girls . The fever of the city was in my blood ; yet each morning my one-eyed servant came to my bedside deferentially and brought me bread and a salt fish and filled my beaker with ale . Then I would wash thyself and sit down to await my patients , to listen to their woes and to heal them. 4It was floodtime . The waters had risen as high as to the temple walls , and when they sank again , the land sprouted forth in tender green , birds built their nests , and lotus flowers blossomed in the pools amid the perfume of acacias . One day Horernheb came to my house and greeted me . He was dressed in royal linen with a gold chain about his neck . In his hand he carried a whip denoting that he was an officer in Pharaoh 's household . But now he held no spear . " I come for counsel , Sinuhe the Lonely , " said he . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bull and as bold as a lion . There is nothing a doctor can do for you . " " I ask you as a friend not as a physician , " he said sitting down . Kaptah poured water over his hands , and I offered him cakes my mother Kipa had sent me and wine from the harbor , for my heart rejoiced at the sight of him . " You have been promoted then . You are now an officer of the householdand no doubt the light of all women 's eyes . " His face darkened . " And what filth it all is ! The palace is full of flies that blow on me . The Theban streets are hard and hurt my feet , and my sandals chafe them sore . " He kicked off the sandals and rubbed his toes . " I am an officer in the bodyguard , yes  --  but some of the officers are ten-year-olds whose side locks are still unshorn , and because of their high birth they laugh at me and mock me . Their arms have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gold and silver toys ; they might cut meat with them but never strike down an enemy . The soldiers drink and lie with the household slave girls and are without discipline . In the militaryschool they read outdated treatises  --  they have never seen war or known hunger and thirst or fear of the enemy . " He rattled the chain about his neck impatiently and went on . " What are chains and honors when they are won not in battle but in prostra-t ions before Pharaoh ? The Queen Mother has tied a beard to her chin and girded herself with the tail of a lion , but how can a warrior lookup to a woman as his chief ? In the days of the great Pharaohs the warrior was a man not altogether despised , but now the Thebans look upon his profession as the most contemptible of all and shut their doors to him . I waste my time . The days of my youth and strength trickle away while I study the arts of war under those who would turn and fly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falcon ! Soldiers are made upon the field of battle and nowhere else , and they are tried in the clash of arms . I will stay here no longer ! " He smote the table with his whip , overturning the wine cups , and my servant fled with a yelp of fear . " Horemheb , my friend  --  you are ill after all . Your eyes are fevered , and you are bathed in sweat . " " Am I not a man ? " He smote his chest . " I can lift a brawny slave in either hand and crack their heads together . I can bear heavy burdensas a soldier should , I can run long distances without becoming breathless , and I fear neither hunger and thirst nor the desert sun . But all this is shameful in their eyes , and the women in the golden house admire only such men as do not need to shave ; they like them with slender wrists and hairless chests and hips like girls ' . They admire the ones who carry sunshades and paint their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am despised for being strong and for having sunburned skin and hands , that show that I can work . " He fell silent , staring before him . At length he emptied his goblet . " You are alone , Sinuhe  --  and so am I , for I guess what is to come . I know that . I was born to a high command and that one day both kingdoms will have need of me . But I can no longer bear to be alone , Sinuhe . There are sparks of fire in my heart ; my throat feels tight ; I can not sleep . I must get away from Thebes  --  the filth stifles me , and the flies soil mc . " Looking at me then , he said in a low voice , " Sinuhe , you are a doctor . Give me a remedy that will conquer love . " " That is easy . I can give you berries that when dissolved in wine will make you strong and hot as the baboon so that women sigh in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nay , you misunderstand me , Sinuhe . There is nothing wrong with my strength . I want a remedy for folly . I want a remedy to quieten my heart  --  and turn it into stone . " " There is no such remedy . A smile  --  a glance from green eyes  --  and the physician 's arts are powerless . This I know . But the wise say that one evil spirit can be driven out by another . Whether this is true I know not  --  but I fancy the second might be worse than the first . " 68 " What do you mean ? " he demanded irritably . " I am weary of twisted phrases . " " Find another woman to drive the first from your heart . That is all I meant . Thebes is full of lovely , seductive women who paint their faces and wear the thinnest of linen . You may find one among them to smile upon you , being young and strong with slender limbs and a gold chain about your neck . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you desire . Even though she be married , there is no wall too high for love to surmount . When a woman desires a man , her cunning can remove all barriers . Stories from both kingdoms prove that . The love of women is said to be as constant as the wind , blowing always and merely changing its direction . Women 's virtue , they say , is like wax and melts in the heat . So it has been and ever will be . " " She is not married , " snapped Horemheb . " You are beside the mark with your prattle of constancy and virtue . She does not even see me though I dwell under her eyes nor take my hand if I stretch it forth to help her into her chair . " " She is then a lady of some distinction ? " " Vain to speak of her . She is lovelier than the moon and the stars and more remote . Truly I could more easily grasp the moon in my arms . Therefore , I must forget  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have surely not fallen victim to the charms of the Queen Mother , " I exclaimed jestingly , for I wanted to make him laugh . " She is too old and fat to please a young man . " " And she has her priest , " returned Horemheb with contempt . " I believe they were adulterers while the king yet lived . " I stopped him with my raised hand and said , " You have drunk from many poisoned wells since you came to Thebes . " " The one I desire paints her lips and cheeks yellow red , and her oval eyes are dark , and no one has yet touched those limbs veiled by the royal linen . Her name is Baketamon , and in her veins flows the blood of the Pharaohs . Now you know all my madness , Sinuhe . But if you tell anyone or remind me of it with so much as a word , I will seek you out and slay you wherever you may be  --  I will put your head between your legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly alarmed at what he said , for that a man of low birth should raise his eyes to Pharaoh 's daughter to desire her was a dire thing indeed . I answered , " No mortal may approach her . If she is to marry anyone , it will be her brother , the heir , who will raise her up to be his equal as royal consort . And thus it will be , for I read it in her eyes at the deathbed of the King when she looked at no one but her69brother . I feared her as a woman whose limbs will bring no warmth to any man , and emptiness and death dwell in her glance . Depart , Horemheb , my friend ; Thebes is no place for you . " He retorted impatiently , " All this I know better than you , and your chatter is as the buzz of flies in my ear . Let us rather return to what you said of the evil spirits , for my heart is full ; and , when I have drunk wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever it be . But her robe must be of royal linen ; she must wear a wig and paint her lips and checks yellow red , and to awaken my desire her eyes must be curved like the rainbow . " I smiled . " You say wisely . Let us therefore debate the matter like friends . " " Listen ! Among my fellow officers is one Kefta from Crete , whom I once had occasion to kick . He now respects me , and he invited me to go with him today to a reception at a house near the temple of some cat-headed god . I have forgotten the name of the god , having felt no inclination to go . " " You mean Bast . I know the temple , and the place is in all likelihoodwell suited to your purpose , for light women pray much to the cat-headed one and make sacrifice to win wealthy lovers . " " But I do not go without you , Sinuhe . I am of low birth , ignorant of behavior in Thebes and especially among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and were born here , and you must come with me . " I was flushed with wine , and his confidence in me was flattering ; I would not confess that my knowledge of women was as slight as his . I sent Kaptah for a carrying chair and bargained with the porters while Horemheb drank more wine to give himself courage . The men carried us to the temple of Bast . When they saw that torches and lamps burned before the doors of the house we were to visit , they began to complain loudly of their payment until Horemheb slashed at them with his whip and they fell into injured silence . I led the way in , and no one seemed surprised at our coming . Cheerfulservants poured water over our hands , and the aroma of hot dishes , of ointments and flowers , was wafted out as far as the veranda . Slaves adorned us with garlands , and we stepped boldly into the great hall . When we had entered , I had no eyes for any but the woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that her limbs gleamed through it like the limbs of a goddess . On her head she wore a heavy blue wig , and she had much red jewelry ; her eyebrows were blackened , and beneath her eyes was painted a green shadow . But greenerthan all green were the eyes themselves , like the Nile in the heat of summer , so that my heart was drowned in them . For this was Nefernefernefer , whom I had once met in the colonnade of Ammon 's great temple . She did not recognize me but smiled at Horemheb , who raised his officer 's whip in greeting . Kefta , the young Cretan , was there also ; he ran up to Horemheb and embraced him , calling him his friend . No one heeded me , and I had leisure to gaze at the sister of my heart . She was older than I remembered , and her eyes no longer smiled but were hard as green stones . They did not smile though her mouth smiled , and they rested first upon the gold chain about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . There was much shouting and laughter ; overturned wine jars and crushed flowers lay about the floor , and the Syrian musicians handled their instruments to such purpose that no conversation could be heard . It was evident that there had been a great deal of drinking , for one woman vomited . A servant handed her a bowl too late so that her dress was befouled and everyone laughed . Kefta the Cretan embraced me , also , smearing salve all over my face as he did so and calling me his friend . But Nefernefernefer looked at me and said , " Sinuhe ! I once knew a Sinuhe ; he also was to be a physician . " " I am that Sinuhe , " I said , looking her in the eye and trembling . " No , you are not he . " She made a gesture of denial . " The Sinuhe I knew was a young boy with eyes as clear as a gazelle 's  --  but you are a man with the ways of a man . There are two furrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his . " I showed her the ring with the green stone that I wore on my finger , but she shook her head , pretending to be puzzled , and said , " I must be entertaining a robber in my house , who has killed that Sinuhe and stolen the ring I once gave him in token of our friendship . His name also you have stolen , and the Sinuhe who pleased me no longer lives . " She raised her hands in the gesture of grief , and in my bitterness I took the ring from my finger and handed it to her , saying , " Take back your ring then , and I will go and vex you no longer . " But she said , " Do not go ! " and again , laying her hand lightly on my arm as she had done once before , she said softly , " Do not go ! " And I did not go though I knew that her body would burn me worse than fire and that never again could I be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wine was never more delectable in my mouth than then. sawn unu tnrcw it down ; she also removed her wig so that she was quite naked . She pressed her breasts together with tier hands , telling the servants to pour wine between them , and she let any drink there who cared to . Shc reeled down the room laughing loudly  --  young , beautiful , reckless  --  and , pausing before Horemheb , she offered him the wine between her breasts . He bent his head and drank . When he raised it again , his face was dark , and he looked the woman in the eyes , seized her bare head in his hands , and kissed her . Everyone laughed , and the woman laughed with them . Then becoming shy all at once , she demanded a fresh gown . Servants clad her , and she put on her wig again . She sat close to Horemheb and drank no more . The Syrian musicians played on ; I felt the fever of Thebes in my blood and knew that I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing mattered any more as long as I might sit beside the sister of my heart and gaze on the greenness of her eyes and the redness of her lips . Thus it was through Horemheb that I came to meet Nefernefernefer my beloved once again ; but it would have been better for me if I had never met her. 5 " Is this your house ? " I asked her as she sat beside me , surveying me with her hard green eyes . " This is my house , and these are my guests . I have guests every evening , for I do not care to be alone . " " And Metufer ? " I asked , for I wished to know all , despite the pain it might cause me . She frowned a little . " Did you not know that Metufer is dead ? He died because he misusedmoney Pharaoh had given his father for the building of a temple . Metufer died , and his father is no longer the royal master builder . Did you not know that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can almost believe that Ammon punished him , for he mocked the name of Ammon . " I told her how Metufer and the priest had spat in the face of Ammon 's statue to wash it and how they had rubbed themselves with Ammon 's sacred ointment . She smiled , but her eyes had a hard , distant look in them . Suddenly she said , " Why did you not come to me then , Sinuhe ? If you had72in visiting other women with my ring on your finger , , . . " I was but a boy and I feared you  --  but in my dreams y ! sister , Nefernefernefer , and  --  laugh at me if you will  --  1 have lain with any woman . I have been waiting to see you again . " She laughed and made a gesture of disbelief . " You are certainly lying . In your eyes I must seem an ugly old woman , and it diverts you to mock me and lie to me . " Her eyes wete gay now as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart swelled and ached as I looked at her . " It is true that I have never touched any woman , " I said , " but it may not be true that I have waited for you . Let me be honest . Very many women have come before me , young and old , pretty and plain , wise and simple ; but I have looked upon all alike with the eye of a physician ; and not one of them has stirred my heart ; though why this should be I can not tell . " " Perhaps when you were a little boy you fell from the top of a wagon load and landed astride the shaft , so that ever since then you have been melancholy and happier alone " ; and , as she laughed , she touched me lightly as no woman had ever touched me . Reply was needless , for she knew herself that what she said was untrue . She quickly withdrew her hand , whispering : " Let us drink wine together . I may yet take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the slaves carried some of the guests out to their chairs , and Horemheb put his arm about the woman beside him , calling her his sister . He took the gold chain from his neck and would have hung it about hers . But she resisted and said angrily , " I am a decent woman and no harlot ! " Rising , she moved away in an offended manner , but in the doorway beckoned secretly and Horemheb followed her . I saw nothing more of either of them that evening . Those who yet remained went on drinking . They staggered about the floor tripping over stools and rattling sistra they had filched from the musicians . They embraced , calling each other brother and friend  --  and then fell out with blows and cries of gelding and eunuch . I was drunk , not with wine but with the nearness of Nefernefernefer and with the touch of her hand , until at last she made a sign and the servants began to put out the lights , carry away tables and stools , and gather up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must go . " But each word stung my heart like salt in a wound , for I dreaded73losing her , and every moment not spent in her company seemed to me wasted . " Where will you go ? " she asked in feigned surprise . " I go to keep watch tonight in the street before your house . I go to make sacrifice in every temple in Thebes , in thanksgiving to the gods that I have met you again . I go to pluck blossoms from the trees to strew in your path when you leave your house and to buy myrrh with which to anoint your door posts . " She smiled and said , " It would be better if you did not go , for flowers and myrrh I have already . And if you go fired so with wine , you will run astray among strange women . That I will not allow . " Her words filled me with joy . I would have seized her , but she resistedme , saying , " Stop ! My servants can see us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " She led me out into her garden , which lay in moonlight and was filled with the scent of myrtle and acacia . The lotus flowers in the pool had closed their chalices for the night , and I saw that the edge of the pool was inlaid with colored stones . Servants poured water over our hands and brought us roast goose and fruits steeped in honey , and Nefernefernefer said , " Eat and enjoy yourself here with me , Sin uhc . " But my throat was roughened by desire , and I could not swallow . She gave me a mocking look and ate greedily . Each time she glanced at me the moonlight was mirrored in her eyes . I would have drawn her into my arms , but she pushed me away , saying , " Do you not know why Bast , the goddess of love , is portrayed as a cat ? " " I care neither for cats nor gods , " said I , reaching out to her , my eyes blurred with desire . She pushed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may lay your hands on my breast and my stomach if it will quiet you , but first you shall listen to me and learn why a woman is like a cat and why passion , too , is like a cat . Its paws are soft , but they hide claws that rip and tear and stab mercilessly into your heart . Ay , indeed , a woman is like a cat , for a cat also takes pleasure in tormenting its prey and torturing it without ever tiring of the game . Not until the creature is maimed will she devour it and then set forth to seek another victim . I tell you this because I would be honest with you ; I have never wished you ill . No , I have never wished you ill , " she repeated absently , taking my hand and moving it to her breast while the other she placed in her lap . I trembled , and the tears sprang from my eyes . Then she pushed me away again. 74 " You may leave me now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But if you do n't go now , you ca n't blame me for anything that may happen . " She gave me time to go , but I did not . Sighing a little then as if weary of the game , she said , " So let it be . You must have what you came for , but be gentle , for I am tired , and I fear I may fall asleep on your arm . " She took me to her room and to her couch of ivory and ebony . There , slipping off her robe , she opened her embrace to me . It was as if my whole self were being burned away to ashes by her body . Soon she yawned and told me , " I am very sleepy  --  and I must believe that you have never lain with a woman before , for you go about it very clumsily and give me no pleasure . But when a youth takes his first woman , he gives her a priceless treasure . I will ask no other presentof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you have had what you came for . " And when I sought to embrace her again , she defended herself and sent me away . I went home with a body molten and seething , knowing that never should I be able to forget her. 6On the following day I told my servant Kaptah to send away all my patients and bid them seek other doctors . I sent for a barber , washed and anointed myself with sweet-smelling oils , dressed , and ordered a chair , telling the porters to run . I desired to hasten to the house of Nefernefernefer without soiling my clothes or feet with dust . Kaptah looked after me with concern and shook his head , for I had never before left my workroom in the middle of the day , and he feared that if I neglected my patients the fees would dwindle . But I had one thought only , and my body burned as with fire  --  a glorious fire . A servant admitted me and led me to Nefernefernefer 's room . She was adorning herself before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you want , Sinuhe ? You weary me . " " You know very well what I want , " I said , trying to gather her into my arms and remembering her ardor of the night before . But she pushed me roughly away . " Is this malice or stupidity ? To come now ! A merchant has arrived75from Sidon with a jewel that was once a queen 's  --  a forehead ornamentfrom a tomb . This evening someone is to give it to me ; I have long yearned for a gem such as no one else possesses . Therefore I shall make myself beautiful and let them anoint my body . " She undressed without embarrassment and stretched herself upon the bed for a slave girl to rub salve into her limbs . My heart rose into my throat , and my hands sweated at the sight of her beauty . " Why tarry , Sinuhe ? " she asked when the slave had gone , leaving her lying there unconcernedly upon her bed . " Why have you not gone ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed at her , but she warded me off so adroitly that I could not take her and stood there finally shedding tears of thwarted desire . I said at last , " If I could buy you that jewel I would , as you well know  --  but no one else shall touch you  --  I will die first . " " Ali ? " she said , her eyes half shut . " You forbid anyone else to touch me ? And if I give up this day to you , Sinuhe  --  if I eat and drink and play with you today  --  since no one knows what tomorrow will bring  --  what will you give me ? " She stretched out on the bed so that her flat belly was hollowed . There was not a hair on her , either on her head or on her body . " I have indeed nothing to give you , " and I looked about me as I said it  --  at the floor of lapis lazuli inlaid with turquoises and at the many golden cups that were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " My knees gave beneath me , and I was turning away when she stopped me . " I am sorry for you , Sinuhe , " she said softly , stretching her lithe body once more . " You have already given me what you had that was worth giving  --  although its value appears to me much overrated .. But you have a house and clothes and all the instruments that a physician needs . You are not altogether poor , I think . " Trembling from head to foot , I said , " All that is yours , Nefernefernefer , if you wish . It is worth little , but the house is fitted up for a doctor 's use . A student in the House of Life might give a good price for it if his parents had the means . " " Do you think so ? " She turned her naked back to me , and as she contemplated herself in the glass , she drew her slender fingers along the black lines of her brows . " As you will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all youpossess may be transferred to me in my name . For though I live alone , I am not a woman to be despised , and I must make provision for the future when perhaps you will cast me off , Sinuhe . " I stared at her naked back ; my tongue grew thick in my mouth , and my heart began to beat so violently that I turned hastily and went . I found a law scribe who quickly made out the necessary papers and dispatched them to the royal archives for safekeeping . When I returned , Nefernefernefer had clothed herself in royal linen and wore a wig as red as gold ; neck , wrists , and ankles were adorned with the most splendid jewelry . At the entrance a handsome chair awaited her . Handing her the scribe 's receipt I said , " All that I possess is now yours , Nefernefernefer , even to the clothes I have on . Let us now eat and drink and take our pleasure together this day , for no one knows what tomorrow may bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ebony casket and said , " I am sorry , Sinuhe , but I find that my monthly trouble is upon me so you can not come to me as I had wished . You had better go now until I have made the appointed purification , for my head is heavy , and my body pains me . Come another day , and you shall have your desire . " I stared at her with death in my breast and could not speak . She stamped with impatience . " Away with you . I am in a hurry . " When I sought to touch her , she said , " Do not smudge the paint on my face . " I went home and set my belongings in order , that all might be ready for the new owner . My one-eyed slave followed every step I took , shaking his head , till his presence maddened me . I burst out , " Do not hang at my heels ; I am no longer your master . Another owns you now . Serve him obediently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him as you did from me , for it may be his stick is harder than mine . " Then he cast himself to the ground , raising his hands above his head in the depth of his grief and weeping bitterly . " Do not send me away , lord , for my old heart has grown into your ways and will break if you banish me . I have always been faithful to you , young and simple though you are . What I have stolen from you I have stolen with due regard to your advantage . I have run about the streets on my old legs in the noonday heat , crying your name and merits , though the servants of other physicians have beaten me and cast dung upon me . " My heart was as if filled with salt , and I had a bitter taste in my mouth as I looked at him . But I was touched , and gripping him by the shoulders I said , " Get up , Kaptah ! Of what use is all this outcry ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been content with your service , though you have often shown your temper in a shameless manner by slammingdoors and clattering the dishes when something has vexed you . And your pilfering has not angered me , for it is a slave 's right . I have been forced to hand you over against my will , for I had nothing else to give ; my house has gone , too , and all that I possess , so that not so much as the clothes upon my back are my own . You lament in vain . " Kaptah tore his hair and groaned , " This is an evil day ! " He mused heavily for a time , and then went on , " You are a great doctor , Sinuhe , despite your youth , and the world lies before you . It will be best , therefore , if I make haste to gather up those things that are of most value , and when darkness comes , we can fly . We can make our way to the Red Lands , where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea where the wine is sparkling and the women joyous . In the land of Mitanni , also , and in Babylon , where the rivers flow in the wrong direction , the arts of Egyptian physicians are highly regardedso that you may grow rich and I may become the servant of a respected master . Hasten , therefore , lord , that we may pack up your belongings before dark , " and he tugged at my sleeve . " Kaptah , Kaptah ! Spare me this witless chatter . My heart is grieved to death , and my body is no longer my own . I am bound with fetters that are stronger than copper chains though you do not see them . I can not fly , for to be absent from Thebes is to be in a glowing furnace . " My servant sat on the floor , for his feet were afflicted with painful swellings that I treated from time to time when I had leisure . He said , " It is clear that Ammon has abandoned us  --  which I can not wonder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , I have faithfully sacrificed one fifth of what I have stolen from you in thankfulness for having been given a young and simple master . Now he has abandoned me also . Well , well . . . We must change gods and hasten to make sacrifice to some other who will perhaps divert the evil from us and make all well again . " " No more of this nonsense . You forget we have nothing to sacrificesince all is now another 's . " " A man or a woman " 78 " A woman , " I answered  --  for what need was there to conceal it ? When he heard this , he burst out in fresh lamentation . " Oh , that I had never been born into this world ! Oh , that my mother had strangled me in my navel cord at birth ! For there is no bitterer fate for a slave than to serve a heartless woman  --  and heartless must she be who has done this to you . " " She is in no way heartless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I needs must talk of Nefernefernefer even to my slave , having no one else in whom to confide . " Naked upon her couch she is more beautiful than the moon . Her limbs gleam with costly oils , and her eyes are green as the Nile in the heat of summer . Happy are you and enviable , Kaptah , if you are permitted to live near her and breathe the same air . " Kaptah made yet louder outcry . " She will sell me for a porter or a quarryman  --  my lungs will be choked , and blood will spurt from under my nails , and I shall perish in the mud like a mangled donkey . " In my heart I knew that this might be the truth , for in the house of Nefernefernefer there would scarcely be bread and houseroom for such as he . Tears fell from my eyes , also , though I did n't know whether I wept for him or for myself . When Kaptah saw this , he fell silent at once and stared at me aghast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared not that my slave should see me weep . Touching my head with his broad hand , he said ruefully did not dream he was so white and pure  --  like a cloth before its first washing . For that alone would explain it . I marveled , indeed , that my master never sent me out for a girl when he came back at night from the wine shop , and the women I sent you for your pleasure went peevishly away , calling me rat and carrion crow . And there were young and comely ones among them . But my trouble was wasted , and like a blockhead I rejoiced , thinking you would never bring a wife into your house to cuff me on the head and throw scalding water over my feet whenever she had quarreled with you . Fool , blockhead that I was ! It is the first firebrand that burns down the hut . " He also said much more , and the sound of his voice was as the buzzing of flies in my ears . At length he ceased and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I could not eat , for my body was on fire ; and , when evening came , one thought alone filled my mind. 79BOOK 4NeferneferneferIEARLY in the morning I went to Nefernefernefer 's house , but she was still sleeping . When I roused her servants , they swore and threw slops over me , so I sat in the doorway like a beggar until I heard movement and talk in the house and then tried once more to enter . Nefernefernefer lay upon her bed . Her face looked small and white , and her green eyes were dark from wine drinking . " You bore me , " she said . " What is it you want ? " " To eat and drink and take pleasure with you , " I replied heavily , " for so you promised . " " That was yesterday . Today is a new day . " A slave girl drew off Nefer 's rumpled dress and oiled and rubbed her limbs . Nefer regarded herself in the mirror , painted her face , put on her wig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones set in antique gold , she placed it on her forehead . " It is beautiful , " she said , " and worth the price , though I am as weary as if I had been wrestling all night . " " So you lied to me yesterday , and there was nothing to hinder us , " I said , though in my heart I had known it . " I was mistaken  --  but my time should have come , and I fear you have got me with child , Sinuhe , for I was limp in your arms , and you were violent . " But she smiled mockingly . " So your jewel comes from a royal tomb in Syria  --  was n't that what you told me yesterday ? " " Ah , " she said softly . " It was found beneath the pillow of a Syrian merchant  --  but do not let that vex you . He was a paunchy man , as fat as a pig , and he smelled of onions . I have what I sought and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wig and ornament and dropped them carelessly on the floor beside the bed . Her bare skull was smooth and comely as she stretched herself out again and pillowed her head on her clasped hands . " I am weary , Sinuhe , and you abuse my weariness by thus devour-83ing me with your eyes when I have not strength to prevent you . You should remember that though I live alone I am not a woman to be despised . " " You know very well that I have no more to give you , for you already possess all that was mine . " I bowed my head down to the edge of the bed and caught the perfumeof her ointments and of her body . She put out her hand to touch my hair , then withdrew it quickly , laughing and shaking her head . " What deceivers men arc ! You lie to me , too , Sinuhe . I can not help my fondness for you  --  I am weak . " But when I would have taken her in my arms , she pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bitter resentment , " Weak , lonely though I may be , I will have no dealings with cheats and swindlers . You never told me that your father Senmut has a house in the poor quarter near the harbor . The house is worth little , but the ground it stands on lies near the quays , and his furniture might fetch something at the market . I might eat and drink and take pleasure with you today if you were to give me this property of yours  --  for no one knows what tomorrow may bring , and I must guard my reputation . " " My father 's property is not mine , " I said aghast . " You must not ask of me what is not mine to give , Nefernefernefer . " She tilted her head sideways , watching me with her green eyes . " Your father 's property is your lawful inheritance , Sinuhe , as well you know . And further , you never told me that he is blind and that he has entrusted you with the stewardship of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were your own . " This was true , for when my father 's sight had grown dim , he had given me his seal and asked me to look after his property as he could no longer see to sign his name . Kipa and he had often said that the house would fetch a good price and enable them to buy a little homesteadoutside the city and to live there until the time came for them to take possession of their tomb and start on the journey to immortality . I could not speak , so overwhelmed was I with horror at the thought of deceiving the mother and father who trusted me . But Neferneferneferhalf closed her eyes and murmured , " Take my head between your hands  --  touch my breast with your lips  --  for there is something about you that makes me weak , Sinuhe , so that I forget my own advantage where you are concerned . All day I will take my pleasure with you if you will make over your father 's property to me , however little it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was smooth and small , filling me with fever unspeakable . " So be it , " I said , and my voice grated on my own ears . But when I would have approached her , she said , " You shall enter into the realm that is already yours  --  but first seek out a law scribe to prepare the appointed documents , for I do not trust men 's promises , and I must guard my reputation . " I left her to send for a scribe , and each step away from her was torment . I urged him to hasten , and when all was done , I pressed my father 's seal on the paper and signed it with his name . But when I returned , the servants told me that Nefernefernefer was sleeping , and I had to wait until late evening for her to wake . At last she received me , took the scribe 's receipt , and slipped it carelessly into the black casket . " You are obstinate , Sinuhe , but I am a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have come for . " She lay upon the bed and opened her embrace , but took no pleasure in me . She turned her head aside to look at herself in the mirror , yawning behind her hands , so that the delight I sought was turned to ashes . When I arose from her couch , she said , " You have had what you wanted , Sinuhe ; now go , for you are very wearisome . Another day you may return , but you have no doubt had all you want . " I was like the shell of a blown egg as I staggered home . I desired to be at peace in a dark room , to bury my head in my hands and give vent to my misery in weeping . But on the veranda sat a stranger wearing a braided wig and a Syrian robe of many colors . He greeted me haughtily and said he had come to consult me as a physician . " I do not receive patients any more , " I told him , " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil swellings on my feet , " he said , and he mixed Syrian words with his speech . " Your intelligent slave Kaptah recommended your skill in treating such swellings . Relieve me from my torment and you shall not regret it . " So stubborn was he that at length I led him into my room and called to Kaptah for hot water to wash my hands . There was no reply , but not until I examined the feet of the Syrian , did I recognize Kaptah 's own gnarled and spavined joints . My slave plucked off his wig and burst into roars of laughter . " What mummery is this ? " I exclaimed , and I thrashed him till his laughter turned to howls . When I had thrown the stick aside , he said , 85 " Since I am no Ionger your slave but the slave of another , I may safely tell you that I think of making my escape and therefore wished to discover whether you would know me in this dress . " I reminded him of the punishments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be recaptured sooner or later , for what had he to live on ? But he replied , " Last night , having drunk much beer , I had a dream . You , lord , lay in a burning furnace , but I came to you with stern words and lifting you by the scruff of the neck plunged you into flowing water that carried you away . I have since been to the market to ask an interpreter of dreams what this means . He said that my master is in danger and has a long journey before him and that I for my boldness should come by many blows . This dream is true , for one need but see your face , lord , to know that you stand in great peril . The blows I have had already  --  therefore the end of the dream also must be true . For this reason I have disguised myself , for I am resolved to go with you upon your journey . " . " Your loyalty moves me , Kaptah , " I said and strove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long journey lies before me , but if so it is to the House of Death , where you will scarcely follow me . " " Tomorrow is hidden , " was Kaptah 's pert retort . " You are young and green as an unlicked calf , and I dare not let you set forth alone upon the troubled journey to the House of Death and the Western Land . Like enough I shall come with you to help you with my experience , for my heart is bound to you despite your foolishness . Though doubtless I have begotten many children in my time , yet I have never seen any of them and so have a whim to think of you as my son . By this I mean no offense ; I seek merely to express my affection for you . " This was carrying insolence too far , but I had not heart enough to thrash him , and he was no longer my slave . I shut myself into my room and covered my head and slept like the dead until morning , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deep enough . Yet when at last I awoke , the first things I remembered were the eyes of Nefernefernefer and her body , and I seemed to hold her smooth head in my hands and feel her bosom against mine . I washed , dressed , and anointed my face to go to her. 2Nefernefernefer received me in her garden beside the lotus pool . Her eyes were clear and gay and greener than the waters of the Nile. 86When she saw me she cried , " 0 Sinuhe ! So you have come back  --  then I am perhaps not yet so old and ugly . What do you want ? " I looked at her as a starveling looks at bread until she tilted her head in displeasure . " Sinuhe , Sinuhe  --  again ? I live alone , indeed , but I am no contemptiblewoman , and I must guard my reputation . " " Yesterday I made over to you all my father 's property ; and he is now a poor man , though formerly a respected physician . Being blind , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wash the linen of others . " " Yesterday was yesterday , and today is today . " Her eyes narrowed . " " But I am not extortionate . You may sit beside me and hold my hand . I am happy today and would at least share my heart 's gladness with you , if no other pleasure . " She laughed mischievously and stroked her belly with a light hand . " You do not ask why my heart is glad today , but I will tell you . You must know that a distinguished man from the Lower Kingdom has arrived in the city , and he brings with him a golden bowl of nearly a hundred deben weight , upon which are engraved many beautiful and diverting pictures . He is old , certainly , and so thin that his old shanks will chafe me , yet I believe that in the morning that bowl will adorn my house . " She feigned a deep sigh when I made no answer and sat with her dreamy gaze on the lotuses and the other flowers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stepped down into the pool . Her head rose from the water beside a lotus flower , and she was more fair than all the lotuses . Floating before me with her hands behind her head , she said , " You are silent today , Sinuhe ! Surely it is not I who have unwittingly wounded you ? I would gladly make amends if I could . " I answered in spite of myself , " You know well enough what it is I want , Nefernefernefer . " " Your face is flushed , and I can see the blood pulsing at your temples . Would it not be well to lay aside your robe and step down into the pool here with me to cool yourself this hot day ? None can see us here , so do not hesitate . " I stripped and stepped down into the pool , and my side touched hers . But when I would have held her , she evaded me , laughing and splashing water into my face . " I understand what you want , Sinuhe , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must give me a present , for you know that I am not a woman to be despised . " I shouted in my wrath , " Are you mad ? You know you have robbed me of everything ! I am ashamed and dare never again look my parents in the face . But I am still a physician , and my name is written in the Book of Life . Perhaps I may yet earn enough to give you a present worthy of you . Have pity on me now , for even in the water I burn as in fire and bite my hand till the blood flows when I look at you . " She stretched herself out on the water , her breasts rising above the surface like two rosy flowers . She looked at me from under her greenpaintedeyelids and said , " Can we think of nothing for you to give me ? For I weaken , Sinuhe ; it is troubling to me to see you naked in my pool . You are clumsy and without experience , yet I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet know  --  tricks to sharpen a man 's pleasure and a woman 's also . Consider this , Sinuhe ! " When I snatched at her , she stepped swiftly up out of the pool and standing behind a tree shook the water from her arms . " I am but a weak woman , and men are deceivers  --  you , too , Sinuhe ! My heart is heavy at the thought of it and the tears very near my eyes  --  for it is clear that you are tired of me . Were this not so , you would never have kept from me that your parents have furnished a fine tomb for themselves in the City of the Dead and have paid to the temple the sum needful for the embalming of their bodies against death and for the things necessary to their journey to the Western Land . " When I heard this , I tore at my breast with my hands till the blood came . " Shall I rob my parents of immortality and let their bodies dissolve into nothingness like the bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river for their crimes ? You can not demand such a thing of me ! " The tears were rolling down my cheeks . Though I groaned in anguish , I went up to her , and she pressed her nakedness against me , saying , " Give me your parents ' tomb and I will whisper my brother ' in your ear and be to you a fire of delight and teach you a thousand things unknown to you to bring you joy ! " I had no mastery of myself but wept . " Be it so , and may your name be accursed to all eternity  --  but withstandyou I can not , so powerful is the spell by which you hold me . " " Speak not of sorcery , for that offends me . As you are tedious and out of humor , I will send a servant for the scribe while we eat and88drink to gladden our hearts , that we may enjoy one another when the papers are in order . " And with a joyous laugh she ran into the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands and bowed , stretching forth their hands at knee level . But behind my back they sniggered and mocked me though I pretended that their sneering was no more than the buzzing of flies in my ear . When Nefernefernefercame down , they fell silent ; we ate and drank together , and there were five sorts of meat and twelve sorts of pastry , and we drank mixed wine , which goes quickly to the head . The law scribe came and wrote out the necessary papers . I made over to Nefernefernefer my parents ' tomb in the City of the Dead , with its furnishings , also their deposit in the temple , defrauding them of immortality and of their hope of journeying to the Western Land . I pressed my father 's seal upon the paper and signed it with his name , and the scribe undertook to dispatch the documents to the royal archives that same day and so make them legally valid . He handed the receipt to Nefernefernefer ; she put it into the black casket and paid him for his trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hour I am accursed and dishonoredbefore gods and men  --  it is a high price to pay . Prove to me now that it is not too high . " But she smiled . " Drink wine , my brother , that your heart may be gladdened . " When I would have seized her , she evaded me and filled my winecup from the jar . Presently she glanced at the sun and said , " See , theday is spent , and it will soon be evening . What do you stay for ? " " Well you know ! " " And well you know which well is deepest and which pit is bottomless , Sinuhe . I must hasten to dress and paint my face , for a golden goblet awaits me , which tomorrow will adorn my house . " When I would have gathered her into my arms , she slipped from me with a shrill laugh and called out for the servants , who instantly obeyed her summons . " How came this insufferable mendicant into my house ? Throw him out instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he resists , beat him . " The servants threw me out , numb as I was with wine and fury , and came again to beat me with sticks when I battered at the barred outer door . And when people began to gather about the spot because of my roaring , the servants declared , " This drunkard insulted our89mistress , who lives in her own house and is not a woman to be despised . " They beat me until I was senseless and left me to lie in the street , where men spat upon me and dogs made water upon my clothes . When I came to myself , I was without the will to rise and lay there motionless until the morning . The darkness hid me , and I felt that I should never dare to show my face again . The prince had named me He Who Is Alone and I was assuredly the loneliest mortal in the world that night . But when dawn came , when people began to move about the streets , and merchants displayed their merchandise before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and left the city and hid myself among the reeds for three days and three nights without food or drink . Heart and body were one hideous wound . If any had spoken to me then , I should have screamed aloud , and I feared for my reason . 3 On the third day I bathed my hands and feet and washed the dried blood from my clothes . Turning my face toward the city , I went to my own house . But the house was no longer mine , and at the door was the signboard of another doctor . I called Kaptah , and he came running , sobbing for joy , and threw his arms about my knees . " Master  --  for in my heart you are still my master , no matter who may give me orders . A young man has come here who fancies himself a great physician . He has been trying on your clothes and laughing in his delight . His mother has already been out into the kitchen to throw hot water over my feet and call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they say his hand is not as light as yours and that he does not understand their maladies as you do . " He babbled on , but his one red-rimmed eye was fixed upon me with a look of horror until I said at last , " Tell me all , Kaptah . My heart is already a stone within my breast and incapable of further pain . " Then , raising his arms to express the deepest woe , he declared , " I would have given my one remaining eye to spare you this grief  --  but evil is the day , and it is well that you came . Your parents are dead . " " My father Senmut and my mother Kipa , " said I , raising my hands as custom demands , and my heart stirred in my breast . " This day the servants of the law broke down their door , having yesterday given notice of eviction , but found them lying upon the bed uo longer breathing . Today , therefore , you must bring them to the f louse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pulled down , by order of the new owner . " " Did my parents know why this happened ? " I asked and could not look my slave in the face . " Your father Senmut came to seek you ; your mother led him , for lie could not see . They were old and frail , and they trembled as they walked . But I did not know where you were . Your father said that it was better that way , and he told how the servants of the law had thrown him out of his house and set seals upon his chests and all his property so that he and his wife owned no more than the rags they had upon them . When he asked the reason for it all , the bailiffs laughed and said that his son Sinuhe had sold house and property and the tomb of his parents for gold to give to a bad woman . After long hesitationyour father begged a copper piece of me , that he might dictate a letter to you through some scribe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just then the mother of this man came for me and beat me with a. stick because I was wasting my time in company with a beggar . Perhaps you will believe me when I tell you that I would have given your father the piece of copper , for though I have not yet been able to steal anything from my new lord , still I have copper and silver left of that I stole from you and my previous masters . But when I went back to the street , your parents had already gone . The mother of my new master forbade me to run after them and shut me into the roasting pit for the night so that I might not run away . " " My father left no message ? " " He left no message , lord . " Though my heart was a stone in my breast , my thoughts were serene as birds in cool air . Having reflected for a while , I said to Kaptah , " Give me all the copper and silver you have  --  give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other god will reward you if I can not . I must carry my parents to the House of Death , and I no longer have any means of paying for the embalming of their bodies . " Kaptah began to weep and lament , but at last he went to a corner of the garden , looking this way and that as a dog does that has buried a bone . Lifting up a stone , he drew forth a rag in which he had knotted his silver and copper , less than two deben , though it was the savings of a lifetime . He gave me all of it , though with many tears ; blessed be he , therefore , to all eternity. 90 91 I hastened to my father 's house , where I found the doors smashed and seals placed upon all that was within . Neighbors were standing n the garden ; they raised their hands and shrank from me in horror , uttering no word . In the inner room Senmut and Kipa lay on their bed , their faces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor stood a still smoldering brazier in whose fumes they had perished , having tightly closed the shutters and the doors . I swathed their bodies in the shroud , heedless of the seals on it , and sought out a donkey driver , who agreed to carry away the bodies . With his help I lifted them on to the ass 's back and brought them to the House of Death . But at the House of Death they would not take them , for I had not sufficient silver to pay for even the cheapest form of embalming . Then said I to the corpse washers , " I am Sinuhe , the son of Senmut , and my name is inscribed in the Book of Life , though a hard destinya has deprived me of silver enough to pay for my parents ' burial . There- fore , I beseech you in the name of Ammon and of all the gods of Egypt ; embalm the bodies of my parents , and I will serve you to the best of my skill for as long as it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbornness and cursed me , but at last the pox- eaten foreman accepted Kaptah 's money , hitched a hook under my father 's chin and slung him into the great bath . He did the same to my mother , throwing her into the same bath . There were thirty of these baths . Every clay one of them was filled and one emptied so that the bodies of the poor lay for thirty days steeped in salt and lye to preserve them against death . Nothing more than this was done for them though I did not know it at the time . I had to return to my father 's house with the shroud , which bore upon it the seal of the law . The foreman washer mocked me , saying , " Come back before tomorrow , or we will drag out the bodies of your parents and throw them to the dogs . " By this I saw that he fancied me a liar and no doctor . I returned stony hearted to my father 's house , though the crumbling mud bricks of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden and the pool of my childhood . Therefore , I turned swiftly away when I had put the covering back in its place , but in the door- way I met a scribe who plied his trade at a street corner by the spice dealer 's . He said , " Sinuhe , son of Senmut the Just  --  is it you ? " " It is I. " " Do not run from me , for I have a message to you from your father . He did not find you at your house . " I sank to the ground and covered my head with my hands while the scribe brought out a paper from which he read aloud : " I Senmut , whose name is inscribed in the Book of Life , and his wife Kipa send this greeting to our son Sinuhe , who in Pharaoh'sf house was given the name He Who Is Alone . The gods sent you tous ; throughout your life you have brought us only joy , and great hasIwen our pride in you . We are grieved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been able to help you as weshould have wished . And we believe that in all you did you werejustified and could not help yourself . Do not grieve for us thoughyou must sell our tomb , for assuredly you would not have done thiswithout good reason . But the servants of the law are in haste , and wehave no leisure to await our death . Death is as welcome to us now assleep to the weary  --  as home to the fugitive . Our life has been longand its joys many , but the greatest joy of all we had of you , SinuheGyou who came to us from the river when we were already old and solitary . " Therefore , we bless you . Do not grieve because we have no tomb , for all existence is but vanity , and it is perhaps best that we should vanish into nothingness , without seeking to encounter further perils and hardships on that difficult journey to the Western Land . Remem-f her always that our death was easy and that we blessed you before we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , may your heart be shielded from sorrow , and may you find as much joy in your children as we have found in you . Such is the desire of your father Scnmut and your mother Kipa . " The stone of my heart was melted and flowed out in tears upon the dust . The scribe said , " Here is the letter . It does not bear your father 's seal , nor could he see to write his name , but you will surely believe me when I tell you that I wrote it down word for word at his dictation ; moreover , your mother 's tears have blurred the characters here and there . " He showed me the paper , but my eyes were blinded by tears and saw nothing . Rolling it up he put it into my hand , and continued , " Your father Senmut was a just man and your mother Kipa a good woman  --  if rough-tongued at times , as is the way of women . So I wrote this for your father though he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the paper to you though it is good paper and could be cleaned and used again . " I reflected for a little and then said , " Nor have I any present for you , 92 1 93most excellent man . Take my shoulder cloth , for it is of good stuff though now dirty and creased . May all the gods of Egypt bless you , and may your body be preserved forever , for even you do not know the merit of the deed you have done . " He took the shoulder cloth and went , waving it above his head and laughing for joy . But I went to the House of Death clad only in a loincloth , like a slave or an ox driver , to serve the corpse washers for thirty days and nights. 4As a physician I fancied I had seen all there was to see of death and suffering and had hardened myself to foul smells and the handling of boils and festering wounds . On beginning my service in the House of Death , I found I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us but little trouble . They lay peacefully in their baths in the sharp smell of salt and lye , and I soon learned to handle the hook with which they were moved . But the bodies of those of the better class required more elaborate treatment , and to rinse out the entrails and put them in jars called for a hardened mind . Still more hardened must it be to witness Ammon 's plundering of the dead , exceeding that of the living . The price of embalming varied according to means , and the embalmers lied to the kindred of the dead , charging for many costly oils , salves , and preservatives that they vowed they used , though all was but one and the same sesame oil . Only the bodies of the illustrious were prepared with the full measure of skill . The others were filled with a corrosive oil that consumed the viscera , the cavity being then stuffed with reeds steeped in resin . For the poor not even this was done ; after their removal from the basin on the thirtieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to their relatives . The House of Death was supervised by the priests . Nevertheless , the body washers and embalmers stole all that they could lay their hands on and looked upon this as their right . Only those accursed of the gods or criminals fleeing from authority took service as corpse washers , and they could be recognized far off by the smell of salt and lye and cadavers inseparable from their trade so that people avoided them and would not admit them to wine shop or pleasure house . Since I had volunteered to work among them , the corpse washers supposed me to be like one of themselves , and they hid none of their actions from me . Had I not already witnessed worse things , I should94have fled appalled at the way in which they defiled the bodies of even the most distinguished , mutilating them in order to sell to sorceresses the organs these had need of . If there is a Western Land  --  which for my parents ' sake I hope there may be  --  I believe many of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their journey , despite the sums paid to the temple for their burial . But the greatest rejoicing in the House of Death occurred when the body of a young woman was brought in , no matter whether she were beautiful or plain . She was not immediately thrown into the bath , but for one night was kept as the corpse washers ' bedfellow ; they squabbled and cast lots as to who should have her first . For these tnen were so abhorred that not the wretchedest prostitute would submit to them , though they offered her gold . Not even Negresses would have them but held them in great dread . When once a man had entered the House of Death and taken service there as a corpse washer , he left the place but seldom because of the abhorrence in which his caste was held , and he lived out his life among the carcasses . For the first few days they all seemed to me to be under the curse of the gods , and their talk as they mocked and defiled the bodies outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were skilled craftsmen who held their trade in high honor , regarding it as the most important of all , and among the best of whom it was hereditary . Each of them specialized in some branch , as did the physicians in the House of Life , so that one dealt with the head , , mother the belly , a third the heart , a fourth the lungs , until each part of the body had been treated for its eternal preservation . Among them was an elderly man named Ramose , whose task was the most difficult of all : he had to detach the brain and draw it out through the nose with pincers , and then swill out the skull with purifyingoils . He noted the deftness of my hands with astonishment and began to instruct me so that by the time I had completed half myt service in the House of Death he made me his assistant , and life for me became more bearable . I helped him in his work , which was the cleanest and most highly regarded of any in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others no longer dared frighten me or throw guts and offal upon me . I do not know how it was he had this power , for he never raised his voice . When I observed the thieving and saw how little was done to preserve the bodies of the poor though the fee was large , I resolved to Delp my parents by myself and steal for them eternal life . For to my mind , my sin against them was already so hideous that it could be95made no blacker by a theft . The one hope and joy of their old age had been that of their own eternal preservation , and in my desire to fulfill this hope I embalmed them , with Ramose 's assistance , and bound them in strips of linen , remaining for this purpose forty days and nights in the House of Death . My stay was thus prolonged in order to steal enough for the proper treatment of the bodies . But I had no tomb for them  --  not so much as a wooden coffin  --  and could do no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to leave the House of Death , I became irresolute and my heart thudded in my breast . Ramose , who had noted my skill , invited me to remain as his assistant . I could then have earned and stolen much and lived out my life in the burrows of the House of Death without the knowledge of any of my friends and free from the vexations and sufferings of a normal life . Yet I would not  --  and who can tell why ? Having washed and purified myself most thoroughly , I stepped out of the House of Death , while the corpse washers shouted curses after me and jeered . They meant no ill by this ; it was their way of talking to one another , and the only way they knew . They helped me to carry out the oxhide . Although I had washed , the passers-by gave me a wide berth , holding their noses and making insulting gestures , so steeped was I in the stench of the House of Death . No one would ferry me across the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchman , I stole a reed boat and rowed my parents ' bodies over to the City of the Dead. 5The City of the Dead was strictly guarded by night and day , and I could not find one unwatched tomb in which to hide my parents so that they might live forever and enjoy the offerings that were brought for the rich and illustrious dead . So I bore them out into the desert , where the sun burned my back and drew the strength from my limbs till I cried out in the belief that I was dying . But I carried my burden up into the hills along dangerous tracks that only grave robbers dared to use and into the forbidden valley where the Pharaohs lie entombed . Jackals howled in the night , venomous snakes of the desert hissed at me , and scorpions crawled over the hot rocks . I felt no fear , for my heart was hardened against all danger . Young though I was , I would have greeted death gladly if death had had a mind for me. 96My return to sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bitterness of my shame , and life had nothing to offer me . I had not learned then that death avoids a man who desires it , to snatch at him whose heart holds fast to life . Serpents darted from my path , scorpions did me no harm , and the heat of the desert sun did not stifle me . The watchmen of the forbidden valley were blind and leaf and never heard the rattle of stones as I climbed down . If they had seen me , they would have killed me instantly and left my body to the jackals . So the forbidden valley opened out before me , deathly still ' nd to me more majestic in its desolation than all the enthroned Pharaohs in their lifetime had ever been . I walked about that valley all night , seeking the tomb of some great Pharaoh . Having come so far I felt that only the best was good enough for my parents . I sought and found a tomb whose Pharaoh had not long stepped aboard Ammon 's boat , that the offerings might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore faultlessly performed . When the moon went down , I dug a hole in the sand beside the doorway , and there I buried them . Far away in the desert jackals were howling . It seemed to me that Anubis was abroad , watching over my father and mother and bearing them company upon their last journey . And I knew that their hearts would not be found wanting in the great scales before Osiris , though they lacked the death books of the priests and the lies learned by rote to which the wealthy pinned their faith . Sweet was the relief in my soul as I scooped the sand over them , for they would live from everlasting to everlasting beside the great Pharaoh and humbly enjoy the good offerings set before him . In the Western Land they would journey in Pharaoh 's boat , eat Pharaoh 's bread , and drink his wine . As I was heaping the sand over them , my hand struck against something hard , and I found that I was holding a sacred scarab carved in red stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with holy signs . I trembled and my tears fell upon the sand , for it seemed to me that I had been given a sign from my parents telling me that they were contented and at peace . This I chose to believe , though I knew that the scarab must have fallen from among the furnishings of Pharaoh 's tomb . The moon had set , and the sky was growing pale . I bowed down in the sand ; I raised my hands and said farewell to my father Senmut and my mother Kipa . May their bodies endure forever , and may their lives97in the Western Land be full of all delight . For their sake alone I could hope that such a land exists though I no longer believe it . I regained the banks of the Nile that same day , drank of its waters , and lay down to sleep among the reeds . My feet were cut and torn , my hands bleeding . The desert had blinded me , and my body was scorched and blistered , but I lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6In the morning I awoke to the quacking of ducks among the reeds ; Ammon sailed in his golden boat across the sky , and from the far shore there came to my ears the murmur of the city . River craft glided under red sails ; washerwomen clapped their boards together , laughing and calling out to each other as they worked . The morning was young and fresh , but my heart was empty and life like ashes in my hands . I had made what atonement I could , and now there seemed no further purpose or goal to my existence . I wore a ragged loincloth , like a slave ; my back was burned and scabby ; and I possessed not so much as the smallest copper coin with which to buy food . I knew that if I moved I should soon run into the guards , who would challenge me . I should be unable to answer them , for I believed that the name Sinuhe was accursed and dishonored for all time . I was brooding upon this when I became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight I did not imagine him to be human but rather some specter from an evil dream . There was a hole where the nose should have been , his ears had been cut off , and he was horriblyemaciated . When I looked at him more closely , I saw that his hands were large and bony and his body tough and scarred as from burdens or the chafing of ropes . When he saw that I had observed him , he spoke . " What is that you hold so tightly in your hand ? " I unclenched it and showed him Pharaoh 's sacred scarab , which I had found in the sand of the forbidden valley , and he said , " Give it to me that it may bring me luck , for I stand in sore need of it , poor wretch that I am . " I answered , " I , too , am poor and own nothing but this scarab . I shall keep it as a talisman to bring me good fortune . " " Though I am poor and wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though that is too much to give for a bit of colored stone . But I feel compassion for your poverty . Here is the piece of silver . " And indeed he dug a silver piece from his belt . Nevertheless , I bemethe more firmly resolved to keep the scarab and obsessed with e idea that it would prosper me , and so I told him . He rejoined wrathfully , " You forget I might have slain you where you lay , for I was watching you for a long time as you slept , wondering what you held so tightly in your hand . I waited till you awoke , but I repent now of not having killed you , since you are so ungrateful . " " I see by your ears and nose that you are a criminal escaped from the quarries . You were welcome to kill me as I slept  --  it would have en a kindly action , for I am alone and have nowhere to go . But take eed and fly from here , for if the guards see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward from the walls or at the very least take yi iii back whence you came . " " What sort of stranger are you not to know that I need not fear the guards , being a free man and no slave ? I could enter the city if I wished , but I do not care to walk the streets , for my face terrifies the children . " " How can he be free who has been condemned to a lifetime of labor in the quarries , for so much I see by your nose and ears ? " I sneered , thinking he boasted . He answered , " Do you then not know that the prince , when he was crowned with the crown of the Upper and Lower Kingdoms , decreed that all bonds should be loosed and all slaves freed from mines and quarries so that those who work there now are free men and are paid for their toil ? " He laughed to himself and went on , " Many a stout fellow now dvells among the reeds and lives on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of the Dead  --  for the watchmen fear us , and we fear no one , not even the dead . No man does who has been in the mines ; there is no worse fate than to be sent there as a slave , as you well know . Many of us do not fear even the gods , though I believe that prudence is a virtue , and I am a pious man  --  if I have lived for ten years in a mine . I heard now for the first time that the heir had come to the throne as Amenhotep IV and liberated all slaves and prisoners so that the mines and quarries in the east by the coast were deserted , also those of Sinai . For there was none in Egypt so mad as to work in the mines of his own free will . The royal consort was the Princess of Mitanni , who still played with dolls , and Pharaoh served a new god . " His god is assuredly a very remarkable one , " said the ex-slave , " for98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deserted , and the wealth of Egypt sees no increase . I , indeed , am innocent of evil-doing , being the victim of injustice , but such things have always happened and always will . It is crazy to cut the fetters from hundreds and thousands of criminals in order that one innocent man may be freed . But that is Pharaoh 's affair not mine . Let him do my thinking for me . " He had been examining me as he spoke , feeling my arms and the scabs upon my back . He was not afraid of the smell that still hung about me from the House of Death , and it was clear he pitied me because of my youth , for he said , " Your skin is burned ; I have oil . Will you let me rub you ? " He rubbed oil into my legs and arms , but swore as he did it . " By Ammon , I know not why I do this , for of what use are you to me ? No one oiled me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the injustice done to me . " I knew well enough that all slaves and convicts protest their innocence , but he was good to me , and I wished to be as much to him . Moreover , I was so lonely I dreaded that he might go and leave me to my desolation . So I said , " Tell me of the injustice that was done you , that I may grieve with you . " " Know then , " he began , " that I was once a free man with land to till , a hut , a wife , oxen , and beer in my jar . But I had also a neighbor , an influential man named Anukis  --  may his body rot ! No eye could measure his land ; his cattle were as countless as grains of desert sand , and their bellowing was as the ocean 's roar  --  yet he coveted also my little plot of ground . He caused me all manner of vexation , and after every floodtime , when the ground was measured afresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I lost land . There was nothing I could do ; the surveyors listened to him and not to me , because he gave them handsome presents . " The noseless one sighed and rubbed more oil into my back . " Nevertheless , I might still be living in my hut had the gods not cursed me with a beautiful ( laughter . I had five sons and three daughters , for the poor breed rapidly . When they were full grown they were a help and a joy to me though one of the boys was stolen by a Syrian merchant when he was small . But my youngest daughter was very fair , and in my madness I was proud of her and did not make her do heavy work , or carry water , or tan her skin by toiling in the fields . It would have been wiser to cut off her hair and rub her face with soot , for my neighbor Anukis saw her and desired her and would have letwe keep my field if I had given him my daughter . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with her beauty she would get a decent man for a husband  --  one who would care for me in my old age and show me kindness . " At last his servants set upon me . I had nothing but my staff , but with that I smote one of them over the head so that he died . Then they cut off my nose and ears and sent me to the mines . My wife and children were sold as slaves , but the youngest one Anukis kept for himself , and when he had enjoyed her , he gave her to his servants . Therefore , I think it was unjust to send me to the mines . When after ten years the King freed me , I hastened home , but my cabin was torn clown , alien cattle grazed in my meadows , and my daughter would have nothing to do with me but threw hot water over my feet in the cowmen 's shack . I heard that Anukis was dead and that his tomb lies In the door . City of etoDead Thebes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is written there . But I can not read and no one has read it out to me though I found my way to the tomb by inquiry . " " If you wish it I will read the inscription for you , " I said . " May your body be preserved forever if you will do me this service , I or I would know what is written of Anukis before I die . " We went together to the City of the Dead , unchallenged by the guards , and wandered between the rows of tombs until we reached a large one before which meat had been set forth and many sorts of cakes , fruit , and flowers . A sealed wine jar stood there also . The noselessone ate of the offerings , giving some to me , and then bade me read what was written upon the door . And this is what I read to him : " I Anukis sowed seed and planted fruit trees , and my crops were plentiful because I feared the gods and sacrificed to them one fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , and no one upon my and went hungry at any time during my life , nor did my neighbors lack food , for I brought water to their fields and fed them with my grain in lean years . I dried the tears of the fatherless and robbed not the widows but forgave them their debts , and my name is blessed from end to end of the land . To him whose ox died , I Anukis gave a new , nd healthy one . I was scrupulous in removing no landmarks nor in h indering the water from flowing over my neighbor 's field . I walkedjustice and piety all my days . These things did I Anukis do , that he gods might be gracious to me and lighten my journey to the West- ( rn Land . " The noseless one listened reverently , and when I had finished , he shed bitter tears , saying , " I am a poor man and I believe all that is written . Thus I see that Anukis was a pious man , revered in death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tomb and do him honor . But I am miserable and an evildoer and have neither nose nor ears so that my shame is seen of all , and when I die , my body will be cast into the river , and I shall cease to be . Is not everything in this world great vanity ? " He broke the seal of the wine jar and drank . A watchman came up and menaced him with his stick , but my companion said , " Anukis was good to me in his day , and I would honor his memory by eating and drinking at his tomb . But if you lay hands upon me or upon my friend here beside me  --  a learned man  --  know that there are many sturdy fellows among the reeds , and some of us have knives and will come upon you by night and slit your throat . " He glared at the guard and was horrible to see . The man looked this way and that and went away . We ate and drank by the tomb of Anukis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade . He said , " I see now that it would have been better to give up my daughter willingly to Anukis . Perhaps he would have let me keep my hut and given me presents as well , for my daughter was beautiful and a virgin though now she is a worn-out pallet for his servants . I see that the rights of the rich and powerful are the only rights in this world and that the word of the poor man does not reach the ear of Pharaoh . " Raising the jar to his lips he laughed aloud and said , " Your health , most righteous Anukis , and may your body be preserved forever ! I have no wish to follow you to the Western Land , where you and your like live merrily , unvexed by the gods . Yet it appears to me but right that you should continue in your loving kindness on earth and share with me the golden goblets and the jewels in your tomb , so this next night I shall visit you when the moon is veiled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I exclaimed in consternation and unthinkingly made the holy sign of Ammon . " You would not become a grave robber , for that is the vilest of all crimes in the eyes of gods and men ! " But Noseless , fired with wine , retorted , " You talk great nonsense in your learned way . Anukis is in my debt , and I , being less merciful than he , will enforce my demands . If you try to stop me , I will break your neck . If you are wise , you will help me since four eyes see better than two , and together we could bear away more from the tomb than I could manage alone . That is if there is no moon . " IO2 " I do not wish to be hung head downward from a wall and flogged , " said I in a fright . But on reflection I knew that my shame could hardly he deeper though my friends should see me hanging thus , and death of itself held no terrors for me . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard the tombs , but the new Pharaoh had not given them the presents that were customary after a coronation . So they murmured among themselves , and when they had drunk wine  --  for there was much wine among the offerings  --  they began to break open the tombs and despoil them . No one hindered Noseless and me when we violated the tomb of Anukis , overturned his chest , and took away as many golden cups and valuables as we could carry . At dawn a throng of Syrian merchantshad gathered on the river bank to buy up the plunder and take it down the river in their ships . We sold our booty to them , receiving nearly two hundred deben in gold and silver , which we divided between us according to the weight stamped upon the metal . The price we got was , but a fraction of the true value of the goods , and the gold was alloyed , but Noseless rejoiced greatly . " I shall be a rich man , for in truth this trade is more profitable than staggering under burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . " But I said , " The pitcher goes once too often to the well . " So we parted , and I returned in a merchant 's boat to the other shore and Thebes . I bought new clothes and ate and drank at a wine shop , for the smell of the House of Death was leaving me . But all day long there came from the City of the Dead across the river the notes of horns and the clash of arms . Chariots thundered along the paths be-t ween the tombs , and Pharaoh 's bodyguard pursued the plundering soldiers and miners with spears till their death cries could be heard in Thebes . That evening the wall was lined with bodies hanging by the heels , and order was restored. 7I slept one night at an inn , and then went to what had been my house and called for Kaptah . He came limping forth , his cheeks swollenwith blows . When he saw me , he wept for joy and threw himself at my feet . " Lord , you have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat if you were alive you would surely return for more silver and103copper , for when once a man gives , he must go on giving . But you did not come though I have stolen from my new master as much as ever I did in my life , as you may see by my cheek and by my knee which he kicked yesterday . His mother , the old crocodile  --  may she rot !  --  threatens to sell me and I am in great fear . Let us leave this evil house , lord , and fly together . " I hestitated and he misunderstood me . " I have indeed stolen so much that I can take care of you for a time , and when it is all gone , I can work for you if you will only take me away . " " I came but to pay my debt to you , Kaptah , " I told him , and I counted gold and silver into his hand , many times the sum he had given me . " But if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you may go where you will . " " And if you free me , where shall I go since all my life I have been a slave ? Without you I am a blind kitten , a lamb forsaken by the ewe . Nor should you waste good gold upon my freedom  --  why pay for what is already yours ? " He blinked his one eye in sly reflection . " A big ship is now fitting out for Smyrna , and we might perhaps venture to sail in her if we first make lavish sacrifice to the gods . It is only a pity that I have not found a powerful enough god since I gave up Ammon , who made such mischief for me . " Remembering the scarab I had found I gave it to Kaptah , saying , " Here is a god who is very powerful , though small . Guard him well , for I believe he will bring us luck ; already I have gold in my purse . Clothe yourself as a Syrian , then , and escape if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught as a runaway slave . May the little god help you ; we will so save our money to pay our passage to Smyrna . I can no longer look anyone in the face in Thebes or in the whole land of Egypt , so I will go never to return . " " Make no vows , for who knows what tomorrow may bring ? A man who has once drunk of Nile waters can not quench his thirst elsewhere . I know not what evil you have done  --  you drop your eyes when you speak of it  --  but you are young and will one day forget . A man 's action is as a stone cast into a pool : it makes a splash and rings spread outward , but after a while the waters are still again , and there is no trace of the stone . Human memory is like that water . When sufficient time has passed , everyone will have forgotten you and your deed and you may return  --  and I hope that by then you will be rich and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall not return , " I said resolutely . Just then Kaptah'smistress called him in a shrill voice . I went to wait for him at the street turner , and after a time he joined me there with a basket . In the basket was a bundle , and he jingled some coppers in his hand . " The mother of all crocodiles has sent me marketing , " he said delightedly . " As usual she gave me too little money , but it will all help , or I believe Smyrna lies a long way from here . " His dress and wig were in the basket . We went down to the shore and he changed his clothes among the reeds . I bought him a handsome staff such as is used by servants and running footmen in the houses of the great . Next we went to the quay where the Syrian ships were berthed and found a big , three-masted vessel , on which a rope the thickness of a man 's body ran from stem to stern and from whose mastheadfluttered the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was glad to hear that I was a physician , for he respected Egyptian medicine , and many of his crew were sick . The scarab was bringing us luck indeed , for he entered us on the ship 's register and would take no money for our passage , which he said we should earn . From that moment Kaptah venerated the scarab as a god , anointing it daily and wrapping it in fine cloth . We cast off , the slaves began to bend to their oars , and in eighteen clays we reached the borders of the Two Kingdoms . In another eighteen days we reached the Delta , and in two more the sea lay before its , and there was no further shore in sight . When the ship began to roll , Kaptah 's face turned gray , and he clung to the great rope . Presentlyhe moaned to me that his stomach was rising to his ears and he was dying . The wind freshened , the ship rolled more steeply , and the captain headed her out to sea until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grew uneasy , for I could not understand how he would ever find it again . I no longer laughed at Kaptah because I felt giddy myself and had unpleasant sensations . Presently Kaptah vomited and sank down upon the deck ; his face was green , and he uttered never another word . I became alarmed , and when I saw that many other passengers were vomiting and moaning that they would perish and that they were strangely altered in the face , I hastened to the captain and told him that it was clear that the gods had put a curse on his vessel , as a terrible sickness had broken out on board despite my skill . I begged him to put back to land while he could still find any , or as a doctor I could not answer for the consequences . But the captain reassured me , saying we had a fair wind , which would bring us smartly along on our course , and that I should not mock the gods by calling this a storm . He swore by his beard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themoment he set foot on dry land and that I need not fear for my dignity as a physician . Yet , when I observed the misery of these travelers , I found it hard to believe him . Why I myself did not fall so gravely ill I can not say unless it was that immediately after my birth I had been put to rock on the Nile in a reed boat . I sought to tend Kaptah and the others , but when I would have touched the passengers , they cursed me . When I offered Kaptah some strengthening food , he turned away his face and snapped his jaws noisily like a hippopotamus , to empty his belly though there was no more in it . But Kaptah had never before turned from food , and I began to think he really would die . I was greatly cast down for I had begun to grow used to his nonsense . Night fell , and at last I slept , fearful though I was of the rolling of the ship , the terrifying smack of the sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Days passed , but none of the passengers died ; some indeed recovered enough to eat and walk about the deck . Only Kaptah lay still and touched no food yet showed some sign of life in that he began once more to pray to the scarab , from which I concluded that he had regained hope of reaching land alive . On the seventh day a coast line appeared , and the captain told me that we had sailed past Joppa and Tyre and would be able to make Smyrna direct , thanks to the favorable winds . How he knew all this I can not even now make out . On the following day we sighted Smyrna , and the captain made lavish sacrifice in his cabin to the sea gods and others . The sails were lowered , the oarsmen manned their oars , and rowed us into the port of Smyrna . When we had entered smooth water , Kaptah stood up and swore by his scarab that never again would he set foot aboard a ship . BOOK 5The Khabiri106II SPEAK now of Syria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this end I should explain first of all that the Red Lands differ from the Black Lands in every particular . There is , for example , no river there like ours ; instead , water pours from the sky and wets the ground . Every valley has its hill , and beyond every hill lies another valley . In each of these dwells a distinct people governed by a prince who pays tribute to Pharaoh  --  or did at the time of which I write . The dress of the people is colorful and expertly woven of wool and it covers them from head to foot , partly , I think , because it is cooler in their country than in Egypt and partly because they think it shameful to expose their bodies except when they relieve themselves in the open  --  which to an Egyptian is abomination . They wear their hair long and allow their beards to grow and eat always within doors . Their gods , of which each city has its own , demand human sacrifice . From all this it may readily be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Egypt . It is also clear that to those distinguished Egyptians who held residentposts in the Syrian cities , supervising taxation or commanding the garrisons , their task appeared more of a punishment than an honor . They yearned for the banks of the Nile  --  all but a few , that is , who had succumbed to the alien ways . These had altered the style of their garments and their thoughts and made sacrifice to strange gods . Moreover , the constant intrigues among the inhabitants , the cheating and roguery of the taxpayers , and the squabbles between rival princes embitteredthe lives of the Egyptian officials . I lived in Smyrna for two years during which I learned the Babylonianlanguage , both spoken and written ; for I was told that a man with this knowledge could make himself understood among educated people throughout the known world . The written characters , as is well known , are imprinted on clay with a sharp stylus , and all correspondencebetween kings is so conducted . Why this is so I can not tell unless109it be that paper will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed with which rulers forget their pacts and treaties . Syria differs from Egypt also in that the physician must seek out his patients , who , instead of coming to him , trust to their gods to send him to them . Moreover , they give their presents before and not after they have been cured . This profits the doctor , for patients tend to be forgetful once they are well again . It was my intention to follow my calling here quite unpretentiously , but Kaptah was of another mind . He wished me to lay out all I had in fine clothes and to hire criers who would make known my fame in every public place . These were to announce also that I did not visit patients but that they must come to me , and Kaptah forbade me to receive any who did not bring at least one gold piece with them as a present . I told him this was folly in a city where no one knew me and where the customs differed from those of the Black Land , but Kaptah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for when once he got an idea into his head , he was as stubborn as a donkey . He persuaded me also to visit those doctors who were held in highest repute and to say to them : " I am Sinuhe , an Egyptian physician to whom the new Pharaoh gave the name of Ile Who Is Alone , and I am a man of renown in my own country . I restore the dead to life and bring back sight to the blind if my god wills it  --  for I have a small but powerful god whom I carry with me in my traveling chest . Knowledge differs from one place to another , however , nor are diseases everywhere the same . For this reason I have come to your city to study maladies and to cure them and to profit by your learning and wisdom . " I do not mean in any way to encroach upon your practice , for who am I to compete with you ? I propose , therefore , that you send to me such patients as are under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and especially those requiring treatment with the knife  --  for the knife you do not use  --  that I may sec whether my god will bring them healing . And should such a patient he cured I will give you half of what he gives me , for I have not come here for gold but for knowledge . Should I fail to cure him , I will take nothing from him at all but send him back to you with his gift . " The physicians whom I met in the streets and market places visiting their patients and to whom I spoke swung their cloaks and fingered their beards and said : " You are young , but truly your god has blessed you with wisdom , for your words are agreeable to our ears . What you say of gold and ofIIOpresents is wise as is also your allusion to the knife . For we never use knives to heal the sick , a man who comes under the knife being more certain of death than he who does not . One thing only we desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cures by sorcery , for our own witchcraft is very powerful , and in that branch there is too much competitionboth in Smyrna and in the other cities along the coast . " This was true , for there were many illiterate men haunting the streets who undertook to heal the sick by means of magic and lived fatly in the homes of the credulous until their patients either recovered or died . In this way sick people with whom others had failed came to me , and I treated them , but those I could not cure I sent back to the physiciansof Smyrna . From Ammon 's temple I brought sacred fire to my house that I might carry out the prescribed purification and so venture to use the knife and to perform operations at which the physicians fingered their beards and marveled greatly . I was fortunate enough to give a blind man back his sight , although both physicians and sorcerershad smeared clay mixed with spittle upon his eyelids to no effect . I treated him with the needle , as the Egyptian manner is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the man lost his sight again , for the needle cure is but temporary . The merchants and wealthy men of Smyrna led an idle and luxuriouslife ; they were fatter than the Egyptians and suffered from breathlessnessand stomach troubles . I used the knife on them till they bled like pigs . When my medical stores were exhausted , I found good use for my knowledge in the matter of gathering herbs upon the right days and under favorable aspects of moon and stars , for in this the men of Smyrna had little science , and I dared not trust to their remedies . To the obese I gave relief from their abdominal pains and saved them from suffocation by means of medicines I sold to them at prices graded according to their means . I quarreled with none but gave presents to the doctors and city authorities , while Kaptah spread a good report of me and gave food to beggars and storytellers that they might cry my praises in street and market and preserve my name from oblivion . I earned a quantity of gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested with the merchants of Smyrna , who sent ships to Egypt , to the islands in the sea , and to the land of Hatti , so that I had a share in many vessels  --  a hundredth or a five-hundredth , according to my means at the time . Some ships were never seen again , but most of them returned , and my stakes in them  --  now doubled or tripled  --  were enteredIIIin the trading books . This was the custom in Smyrna , though unknownin Egypt . Even the poor speculated in this way and either increasedtheir funds or became still more impoverished ; ten or twenty of them would pool their copper pieces to buy a thousandth share in a vessel or her cargo . Thus I never had to keep gold in my house as a lure for robbers . Neither was I obliged to carry it with me when I traveled to other cities , such as Byblos and Sidon , in the course of my work , for then the merchant gave me a clay tablet to be presented at the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money from them whenever I required it . Thus all went well with me . I prospered , and Kaptah grew fat in his expensive new clothes and anointed himself with fine oils . Indeed he became insolent , and I was compelled to thrash him . But why everythingfavored Inc so I can not say. 2Nevertheless , I continued in loneliness , and life gave me no delight . I even wearied of wine , for it never cheered me but turned my face as black as soot so that when I had drunk I desired only to die . Therefore , I sought ever to increase my knowledge that no moment of the day should find me idle  --  for in idleness I fretted over myself and my deeds  --  and at night I slept like the dead . I acquainted myself with the gods of Smyrna to learn whether they might hold some hidden truth for me . Like all else , these gods differ from those of Egypt . Their great god was Baal , a cruel god who exacted human blood in return for his favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Moreover , the sea was greedy for sacrifice so that merchants and those in authority must be forever seeking new victims . No crippled slave was ever to be seen , and the poor were threatened with savage punishment for the least offense . Thus a poor man who stole a fish to feed his family was dismemberedas a sacrifice on the altar of Baal . Their female divinity was Astarte , also called Ishtar , like the Ishtar of Nineveh . She had many breasts and was robed every day afresh in jewels and thin garments , being served by women who for some reason were known as the virgins of the temple , though that they were not . On the contrary , they were there to be enjoyed  --  a mission regarded with favor by the goddess -- and the more exquisite the enjoyment , the more gold and silver was offered to the temple by the client. 112But the merchants of Smyrna guarded their own women with great strictness , shutting them up at home and clothing them from head to foot in thick garments lest they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple for the sake of variety and to win divine approval . Thus in Smyrna there were no pleasure houses like those of Egypt . If the temple girls were not to a man 's liking , he had to take a wife or buy himself a slave girl . Slave girls were for sale every day , for ships were continually coming into port with women and children on hoard of every size and color , both plump and thin , to suit all tastes . But the crippled and unfit were purchased cheaply for sacrifice to Baal on behalf of the city council , who would then laugh and slap their chests and commend themselves for their cunning in thus deceiving their god . I , too , made sacrifice to Baal since he was the god of the city and it was prudent to seek his favor . Being an Egyptian , I bought no human sacrifices for him ; I gave him gold . Sometimes I visited Astarte 's temple , which opened in the evenings , to listen to music and watch the temple women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the glory of their goddess . Since it was the custom I lay with them , and I marveled at the practices they taught me of which I had known nothing . But I was not cheered and did all from curiosity . When they had taught me what they had to impart , I wearied of them and no longer visited their temple . To my mind there were no accomplishmentsso monotonous as theirs . But Kaptah shook his head in concern for me , for my face was aging , the furrows between my brows were deepening , and my heart was sealed . His wish was that I should have a slave girl to beguile my leisure moments . Since he kept house and handled my money , he bought a girl for me who was to his own taste . He washed , dressed , and anointed her , and presented her to me one evening when , tired after the day 's work , I desired only to go to bed in peace . This girl was from the islands in the sea ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her eyes were round and gentle like the eyes of a heifer . She gazed at me in veneration and showed fear of the strange city to which she had been brought . Kaptah extolled her charms with the greatest earnestness , and to please him I took her . Yet , though I did my best to escape from my loneliness , my heart was not gladdened , and I could not bring myself to call her my sister . In showing her kindness I erred , for it made her arrogant , and she disturbed me in my interviews with patients . She ate a great deal and grew fat and was forever demanding jewels and new clothes . Also she dogged my footsteps in a continual desire to take pleasure with me . I13It was to no purpose that I made journeys inland and to the cities along the coast . On my return she was the first to greet me , with tears and persecution . I beat her , but in vain ; then she grew hotter than before , and life in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , for one day King Aziru , the ruler of the inland province of Amurru , came to me . I doctored his teeth , making him one tooth of ivory to replace one that had been knocked out in battle and coating other damaged ones with gold . While he remained in the city , conferring with the authorities on administrative business , he visited me every day . He met my slave girl , whom I called Keftiu after the islands in the sea , being unable to pronounceher heathenish name , and he found delight in her . This Aziru was white skinned and as strong as a bull . His beard was blue black and glossy , and his eyes held a bold gleam so that Keftiu began to look upon him with desire  --  for women are ever captivated by what is new . He admired her plumpness above all , and her garments , which she wore in the Greek manner , greatly inflamed him . Though they covered her throat , they left her breast bare , and he was accustomed to seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to restrain his desire , and sighing deeply , he said to me , " Truly you are my friend , Sinuhe the Egyptian , and you have mended my teeth and caused my mouth to glisten with gold whenever I open it , which will greatly enhance my dignity in the land of Amurru . For this I will make you such gifts as shall cause you to raise your hands in wonder . Nevertheless , I am forced to pain you against my will . " Ever since I laid eyes upon the woman in your house , she has pleased me , and I can no longer withstand my desire for her ; it tears at me like a wildcat and not all your arts can heal that sickness . I have never seen her like and can well fancy your fondness for her when she warms your bed at night . " Yet I desire her of you , that I may make her my wife among my other wives and release her from slavery . I tell you this openly , for you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask . But I tell you openly also that if you will not give her up of your free will , I will come and take her by force and carry her off to my country , where you could never find her even if you dared to seek . " At these words of his I raised my hands in delight , but Kaptah who had overheard tore his hair and lamented , " Evil is the day , and better were it that my master had never been born than that you should now take from him the only woman in whom he has found pleasure . Nor114can her loss be made good , for to my lord she is dearer than all the gold in the world  --  all the jewels , all the incense  --  and she is fairer than the full moon , and her belly is round and white as a heap of wheat  --  though you have not yet seen it  --  and her breasts arc like melons , which your own eyes can tell you . " Thus he babbled on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of merchants and hoped for a good price though both he and I desired nothing so much as to be rid of the girl . When Keftiu heard him , she wept also , saying that she would never forsake me  --  but as she wept she peeped admiringly between her fingers at the prince and his curly beard . I raised my hands , and having quieted them , I assumed a grave expression . " Aziru , King of Amurru and my friend ! Truly this woman is dear to my heart , and I call her my sister , but your friendship is dearer to me than anything else . In token of this friendship I will give her to you without payment , and I beg you to accept of her and do with her all that the wildcat within you desires  --  for if I do not deceive myself , her heart is inclined toward you , and she will be content , for in her body also lurk many wildcats . " Aziru cried aloud for joy . " Ah , Sinuhe , Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt  --  from this day you are my brother and my friend ; throughout the land of Amurru your name shall be blessed ; as my guest you shall sit at my right hand above all others , though they be kings . This I swear ! " He laughed so that his teeth flashed . Then as he looked at Keftiu , who had ceased weeping , his face changed . With glowing eyes he gazed at her , seized her by the arms so that the melons swayed , and swung her into his carrying chair without noticing her weight . So he departed , and neither I nor anyone else in Smyrna saw him for a while , for he shut himself up in his lodgings for three days and three nights . Kaptah and I rejoiced at having rid ourselves of the baggage , though he rebuked me for demanding nothing in exchange when Aziru would have given me whatever I asked . But I replied , " By giving him this girl , I have secured his friendship . No one knows what tomorrow may bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  being no more than grazing land for asses and sheep  --  yet a king 's friendship is the friendship of a king , and its worth may prove more than gold . " Kaptah shook his head , but he smeared the scarab with myrrh andI15 placed fresh dung before it in thanksgiving for being quit of Keftiu . Before Aziru returned to his own country he called on me , and bowing to the ground he said , " I offer you nothing , Sinuhe , for you have given me that which can not be requited with gifts . The girl is even more entrancing than I could have believed ; her eyes are like bottomless wells , and I do not weary of her though she has pressed out my seed as oil is pressed from olives . To be frank with you , my country is not a wealthy one , and I can acquire gold in no other way than by taxing the merchants who travel through it or by making war on my neighbors  --  and then the Egyptians are over me like horseflies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not make you such gifts as your action merits . But I promise that whenever you come to me and whatever you ask of me I will give it you if it be in my power to do so  --  as long as you do not ask me either for this woman or for horses , for I have few of them and need them for my chariots . And if any man offend you , send word to me and my men shall slay him , wherever he may be . No one shall come to hear of it , and your name will not be mentioned in the affair . So great is my friendship for you . " Then he embraced me in the Syrian manner . I saw that he honored and admired me , for he took the gold chain from his neck and hung it about mine though his deep sigh as he did so told me how great was this sacrifice . Therefore , I took from my own neck a gold chain I had been given by the richest shipowner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , and I hung it about his neck . He lost noth- ing by the exchange , and this greatly pleased him . And so we parted . 3 Now that I was free of the woman my heart was as light as a bird . My eyes longed to see new things , and I was filled with restlessness and a desire to be out of Smyrna . Spring had come again . The earth was fresh and green ; leaves budded on the trees ; there was a cooing of doves and frogs croaked in the pools . In the harbor ships were being fitted out for long voyages . With the spring also came word that the Khabiri had swarmed in from the desert and were ravaging the Syrian borders from the south to the north , burning villages and besieging cities . But Pharaoh 's armies came too , through the desert of Sinai from Tanis , and were giving battle to the Khabiri . They captured the chiefs and drove the enemy back into the desert . It happened every spring and had always happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were uneasy , for the city of Katna , garrisoned by Egyptian troops , had been plundered , the king slain , and all the Egyptians put to the sword without mercy shown to women or children and without any prisoners being taken and held for ransom . Such a thing had not been known within living memory , for the Khabiri were wont to avoid the fortified towns . War had broken out in Syria , and I had never seen war . I set forth to join Pharaoh 's forces and see whether it held some hidden truth for me and also to study the wounds inflicted by war clubs and other weapons . But above all I went because the commander of the troops was Horemheb , and in my loneliness I longed to see again the face of a friend and hear his voice . Having taken ship along the coast , I made my way inland with the supply column , among the ox-drawn sleds of grain and the donkeys laden with jars of oil and wine and sacks of onions . We came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ; the name of it was Jerusalem . A small Egyptian garrison was stationed here , and here also Horemheb had set up his headquarters . But the rumors that had reached Smyrna greatly exaggerated the size of his force , which comprised but one squadron of chariots and a couple of thousand archers and spearmen , while the Khabiri hordes were said to be as the sands of the desert . Horemheb received me in a dirty mud hut , with the words , " I knew a Sinuhe once . He , too , was a doctor and my friend . " He surveyed me , puzzled by the Syrian cloak I had taken to wearing . Like him I had aged , and my face had altered , but he knew the again and laughed , raising his gold-braided whip of office in salute . " By Ammon , it is Sinuhe ! I thought you were dead . " He drove out his staff officers and the scribes with their maps and papers and ordered in wine . " Marvelous are the ways of Ammon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this filthy , miserable town . " At his words my heart stirred in my breast , and I knew that I had missed him . I told him as much as I thought fit of my life and adventures , and he said , " Come with us and share the honors of war ! I mean to give these lousy Khabiri such a scalding that they will never forget me and will curse the day they were born . I was a green enough lad when we first met ; you were a man of the world and gave me good counsel . I have learned  --  I have learned  --  and I carry a golden whip in my hand , as you see . But I won it by degrading service in Pharaoh 's bodyguard , rounding up the robbers and convicts whom in his madness he had freed from the mines . Trouble enough they gave us before they were all destroyed. 6 117 " When I heard that the Khabiri were attacking , I asked Pharaoh to give me troops to repel them . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wealth and honors shower down more profusely in Pharaoh 's neighborhood than they do in the desert  --  moreover , the Khabiri have sharp spears and their war cries are most horrible , as I have good reason to know . But at last I was able to gain experience and exercise my troops in real battle . However , Pharaoh 's one concern is that I should build a temple here in Jerusalem to his new god and drive out the Khabiri without bloodshed ! " Horemheb burst out laughing and slapped his leg with his whip , and I laughed with him . Then he fell silent , and after another pull at the wine he went on : " To be frank , Sinuhe , I have changed somewhat since we last met , as a man must who lives in Pharaoh 's presence , whether he will or no . He disturbs me , for he thinks deeply  --  and talks  --  about his god , who differs from all other gods . I used often to feel as if a swarm of ants were loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without wine and a woman to clear my head , so strange is this divinity of his . The god is without form though he is everywhere at once ; his image is a circle and has hands , with which he blesses all that he has made ; and slave and lord are equal in his sight . Tell me , Sinuhe , is this not the raving of a sick man ? I can only think that he was bitten by a rabid ape when he was small  --  for who but a madman could fancy the Khabiri may be rooted without bloodshed ? " He drank again . " Horus is my god , and I have nothing against Ammon , either . But I can see that Ammon has grown too powerful , and the new god has set himself up in opposition to strengthen Pharaoh 's sovereignty . That is what the Queen Mother herself said to me , and it was echoed by Eie , the priest who now carries the crook upon the King 's right hand . With the help of Aton they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , for it is not fitting that Ammon 's priests should rule Egypt over the head of Pharaoh . That is sound statesmanship , and as a warriorI can well understand that a new god is indispensable . If Pharaoh were content merely to raise temples to him and fee priests into his service , I should have nothing to complain of . But Pharaoh thinks and talks too much about him . Whatever the occasion , sooner or later he brings the conversation round to him , by which he makes those about him crazier than himself . He says that he lives by truth but truth is like a sharp knife in the hands of a child ; a knife should be carried inits sheath and used only when need occurs . So it is with truth , and for no one is truth more dangerous than for the ruler . " He took another draught of wine . " I thank my falcon that I was able to leave Thebes , for the city is seething like a nest of serpents because of it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The priests of Ammon are already spreading pretty stories about Pharaoh 's origins and fomenting sedition against the new god . His marriage also has caused indignation , for the Princess of Mitanni , who used to play with dolls , died suddenly , and Pharaoh has raised up Nefertiti , the daughter of the priest , to be his consort . Certainly this Nefertiti is beautiful and dresses well , but she is very willful and her father 's daughter in everything . " " How did the Princess of Mitanni die ? " I asked , for I had seen the scared , wide-eyed child gazing out at Thebes as she was carried , decked out and adorned like an image , along the Avenue of Rams to the temple . " The physicians say she could not stand the climate , " he laughed . " And that is a barefaced lie , for it is common knowledge that no countryhas so healthy a climate as Egypt . But you yourself know that the death rate among the royal children is high  --  higher than in the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisest to name no names , but I would halt my chariot before Eie the priest 's house if I dared . " After this we lay down in the tent to sleep . In the morning I was roused by the sound of horns and saw the soldiers falling in by companies , while sergeants ran up and down the ranks yelling at them , buffeting them , and striking them with their whips . When all were paraded , Horemheb stepped out from the dirty but with his golden whip in his hand , and a servant held an umbrella over his head and kept the flies off him with a fly whisk while he addressed the soldiers : " Soldiers of Egypt ! This day I lead you into battle , for my scouts report that the Khabiri are encamped beyond the hills . What their numbers are I can not say , for these scouts took to their heels in a fright and never stayed to count them . I hope there will be enough to put an end to all of you so that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Egypt to raise an army of real men who love glory and the spoils of war . " He glared savagely at the troops , and the glare struck home : not one among them dared move an eyelash . " I shall lead you into battle , and you are to know  --  every one of you  --  that I go in the forefront and shall not stay to see which if any ofII8 I19you follow . For I am the son of Horus ; the falcon flies before me ; and I mean to vanquish the Khabiri if I have to do it alone . Nevertheless , I tell you now that this evening my whip will drip blood , for with my own hands I will flog any who do not follow me . And I tell you that my whip bites deeper than the spears of Khabiri , which are of poor copper and brittle . There is nothing terrible about the Khabiri save their voice , which is indeed appalling . If any of you quail at the sound of shrieks , stop your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old women  --  at least feign manhood : you wear loincloths , not skirts . If you defeat the Khabiri , you may share out their cattle among you and their other possessions , for they have collected much booty in the cities they have sacked . You may also divide their women among you ; I think you will enjoy a tumble with them tonight , for the Khabiri women are comely and fiery , and they love bold warriors . " Horemheb paused and surveyed his men , who with one accord raised a great shout , struck their shields with their spears , and brandishedtheir bows . He smiled and with a flick of his whip went on : " I see that you burn for your thrashing , but first we are to consecrate a temple to Pharaoh 's new god Aton . He is by nature an unwarlike god , and I do not think you will take much delight in him . Therefore , the main force may set out upon their march while the reserves stay behind to consecrate the temple and assure themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troops acclaimed him , then began to stream from the city in disorder , each company following its own standard , borne upon a pole . These emblems were lions ' tails and hawks and crocodile heads , which went before them into battle . The light chariots drove on ahead to clear the road . But those officers who held the highest command remained behind with the reserves and followed Horemheb to the temple , which stood on a rise at the outskirts of the city . The temple was small and built of timber . It had been hastily knocked together and daubed with mud . It was unlike other temples , being open in the middle , where the altar stood . No god was to be seen so that the puzzled soldiers looked about to find him . Horemheb told them , " The god is round and is like the sun 's disk , so look into the sky if your eyes can endure the brightness . He holds out his hands over you in benediction , though my mind rnisgives me that today after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-hot needles . " The soldiers murmured that Pharaoh 's god was too distant . They desired one before whom they might prostrate themselves and whomthey might touch with their hands if they dared . But they fell silent as the priest stepped forward , a slim youth with unshaven head , who bore a white cloth over his shoulder . His eyes were clear and eager , and upon the altar he offered up spring flowers and oil and wine , which made the soldiers laugh aloud . He also sang a hymn to Awn that was said to have been composed by Pharaoh . It was very long and monotonous , and the men listened to it with open mouths and very little comprehension . " Most beautiful art thou upon the horizon , Living Aton , source of all things living ! When thou arisest in the eastern skyAll lands are filled with thy glory . Fair art thou , great art thou , radiant above the world . Thy beams embrace all lands and them hast thou created , And they are bound together with the rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays touch the ground ; Exalted art thou ; yet the soles of thy feet move upon the dust . " The priest sang of darkness , of lions that slink from their lairs by night , and of serpents , and many of those who listened were afraid . He sang of the day 's brightness and declared that when the birds spread their wings in the morning it was in adoration of Aton . He declared also that this new god quickened the babe in the womb and gave fertility to the seed of man . Listening to him , one might fancy that there was not one tiny thing in the world with which Aton did not concern himself , nor could even a chick crack its shell and cheep without Aton 's help . The priest ended : " Thou alone dwellest in my heartAnd no man knoweth thee but the King thy son . Thou sharest thy thought with him , Thou anointest him with thy power . The world lieth between thy hands as thou didst create it ; By thy light do men liveAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou art life and men live through thee . All eyes are turned toward thy glory Until the hour of thy setting , All labor ceasethWhen thou declinest in the West . Since thy creation of the worldI20 I2IThou has prepared it for the coming of thy son : For him who was born of thee , The King who liveth by the truth , Lord of both Kingdoms , the Son of Ra , Who liveth by the truth . For the Lord of the Crowns didst thou create the world And for his great consort , his beloved , Queen of the Two Kingdoms , Nefertiti , Who shall live and bloom from everlasting to everlasting ! " The soldiers listened and wiggled their toes in the sand . When at last the song came to an end , they shouted in relief and to the honor of Pharaoh , for all that they grasped of the hymn was the intention to praise Pharaoh and hail him as the son of the god , which was right and fitting : so it had ever been and ever would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man , delighted by the acclamation of the troops , went away to write an account of the event to Pharaoh. 4The men marched away , followed by ox sleds and pack asses . Horemheb dashed ahead in his chariot , while the senior officers proceededin their chairs , complaining of the heat . I was content to sit on the back of a donkey like my friend the quartermaster , and I took with me my medical chest of which I expected to make good use . The column marched until evening with only a brief rest during which the men were allowed to eat and drink . An ever increasing number grew footsore and dropped out by the roadside , unable to rise despite the kicks and whippings of the sergeants . The men swore and sang by turns . With the lengthening of the shadows came the whine of arrows from the rocks bordering the road and now and then a cry from the ranks , where a man clutched his shoulder , in which an arrow was sticking , or fell headlong upon the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pressed onward until the troops were movingat a jog trot . The light chariots cleared the way ahead , and soon we saw lying along the roadside the bodies of Khabiri in ragged cloaks , their mouths and eyes crawling with flies . Some of our men fell out to turn these bodies over in search of plunder , but there was nothing left to take . The quartermaster sweated on his donkey and bade me take his122last greeting to his wife and children , for he felt that this was to be his last day . He told me where in Thebes his wife was to be found and begged me to see to it that no one looted his corpse  --  provided we were not all dead by evening , he added , with a gloomy shake of the head . At last there opened out before us the wide plain on which the Khabiri were encamped . Horemheb gave order for the sounding of horns and disposed his troops for attack , spearmen in the center and bowmen on either flank . The chariots , save for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a certain part elsewhere , and they raced off at such speed that the dust whirled up and hid them . From the valleys beyond the hills rose the smoke from burning villages . The Khabiri on the plain seemed numberless , and their howls and yells filled the air as they advanced upon us , shields and spear points glintingmenace in the sunlight . Horemheb shouted with a loud voice , " Stiffen your knees , you toads , for the fighters among them are few , and what you see are cattle and women and children  --  all to be yours before nightfall . In their cooking pots hot food awaits you . Away with you now , that we may eat , for already I am as famished as a crocodile ! " But the Khabiri host rolled nearer , far outnumbering ours . Their spears looked sharp in the sunlight , and battle held no charms for me . The ranks of our spearmen wavered , and they looked this way and that as I did . The sergeants slashed with their whips and swore  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly , for they stiffened their ranks , and the bowmen twanged nervously at their bowstrings , awaiting the signal . When the Khabiri had drawn near , they uttered their war cry , a howl so horrible that the blood left my head and my legs gave beneath me . At that instant they charged , letting fly with their arrows as they ran . The sound of the arrows was bzzzt , bzzzt , like the buzzing of flies . I know of no more maddening noise than the singing of arrows past the ear . Yet I was heartened to see how little damage they did , for they either flew over our heads or were warded off by the shields . Now Horemheb shouted , " Follow me , you scum ! " His charioteers gave the horses their heads and away they went after him ; the bowmenlet fly their arrows as one man , while the spearmen charged after the chariots . A cry burst from all throats  --  a yell more terrifying than the howl of the Khabiri  --  for each man was shrieking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also at the full pitch of my lungs and found therein great relief . The chariots thundered in among the attacking Khabiri , and away in the forefront , above the swirling dust and thrusting spears , glitteredthe plumed helmet of Horemheb . In the rear of the chariots charged the spearmen led by their battle standards  --  their lions ' tails and hawks  --  while the bowmen scattered about the plain discharging volleys into the harassed enemy . From this moment all was one hideous , clashing , thundering , shrieking , howling confusion . Arrows whistled past my ears ; my donkey shied and bolted into the thick of the struggle , and I yelled and kicked in my extremity but could not hold him . The Khabiri fought resolutely and without fear , and those of them who were trampled underfoot by the horses still lunged with their spears at those who charged over them , and many an Egyptian was slain as he stooped to lop off the hand of his victim in token of triumph . The reek of blood outdid the reek of sweating soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing flocks . Suddenly the Khabiri uttered a shriek of rage and set off in full retreat , for they saw that those chariots which had been sent round the plain had entered their camp ; their women were being attacked and the cattle driven off . This sight they could not endure but ran to the rescue , a move that was their undoing . The chariots rounded upon them and scattered them , and the remainder were dealt with by the spearmen and archers . When the sun had set , the plain was full of handless corpses , the camp was in flames , and from every quarter came the bellowing of frantic cattle . In the delirium of victory our men prolonged the massacre , plunging their spears into all they saw , slaying men who had already laid down their arms , braining children with their clubs , and madly shooting arrows into the stampeding livestock until Horemheb ordered the horns to be sounded ; whereupon officers and subordinates came to their senses and rounded up the rabble with their whips . But my mad donkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his back like a sack of flour till I hardly knew whether I was alive or dead . The soldiers laughed at me and mocked me until at last one of them smote the donkey on the muzzle with the butt of his spear , bringing the beast to a halt so that I could climb down . ThenceforwardI was known among them as the Son of the Wild Ass . The prisoners were driven together into enclosures , the weapons stacked , and herdsmen sent forth to round up the cattle . So numerous were the Khabiri that many of them had made good their escape , butHoremheb surmised that they would run all night and he in no trrl haste to return . In the light of the blazing tents and loads c.f tot.agr the sacred chest was brought forth and placed before Iioretohch. 1 k opened it and lifted out Sekhmet , the Lion-headed , whose .0 ven breast swelled proudly in the firelight . The soldiers , in high juhilann , sprinkled her with drops of the blood that was flowing from their wounds and cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These formed a great heap , and some men brought to it as many as four and five . Horemheb conferred chains and bracelets upon them and honored the most valiant with promotion . He was dusty and bloodstained , and his golden whip was dripping , but his eyes smiled upon his warriors as he hailed them as his own jolly ruffians and bruisers . There was much work for me , as the spears and clubs of the Khabiri inflicted horrible wounds . I labored in the light of the burning tents , and the cries of the wounded mingled with those of the women as they were dragged away by the soldiers , who cast lots for them . I washed and stitched together gaping wounds , thrust entrails back into gashed bellies , and replaced torn flaps of scalp . To those whose death was certain I gave beer and narcotics that they might pass away in peace during the night . I attended also some of the Khabiri whose injuries had prevented flight , stitching and dressing their wounds . For what reason I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horemheb would get a better price for them when he sold them as slaves if I healed them first . But many of them cared nothing for my help and rather tore open their wounds afresh when they heard the crying of their children and the lamentations of their ravished women . They curled up their legs , drew their garments over their heads , and bled to death . I watched them and felt less proud of the victory than before . ' I'licy were but poor starving desert folk , tempted by the cattle and grain of the valleys to make these desperate raids into Syria . They were gaunt and suffered often from eye diseases . Though they were valiant and terrifying in war and left behind them a trail of burning villages , yet I could not but feel compassion when I saw them draw their ragged garments over their heads to die . On the following day I met Horemheb and begged him to set up a guarded camp where the soldiers who had been most gravely wounded could recover since if they were taken straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Horemheb thanked me for my help , and said , " I never credited you124 I25withecuch valor as you displayed yesterday , riding into the thick of battle on your mad donkey . You can not have known that in war the physician 's task does not begin until the battle is over . I have heard the men call you the Son of the Wild Ass , and if you wish it , I will take you into battle in my own chariot . Good fortune must surely attend you since you are still alive , though you carried neither spear nor club . " " Your men praise your name and swear to follow wherever you lead them , " I said , to flatter him . " But how is it that you are not even wounded after charging alone into the thick of the spears ? Are you protected by some powerful magic , or how comes it that you feel no fear ? " " I know that I am destined to perform great deeds , though how I know this I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side or he has not , and I have had it since the falcon led me to Pharaoh . It is true , that my falcon did not love the palace and flew away never to return . But as we were marching across the desert of Sinai , enduring great hunger and greater thirst  --  for I suffered with my men to learn what they were feeling and so have command over them  --  I saw in some valley a burning bush . It was of living fire shaped like some big bush or tree , and it was not consumed but burned night and day . The earth round about it had a smell that went to my head and inspired me with courage . I saw it as I was driving ahead of my troops to hunt the wild beasts of the desert , and it was seen by no other save my charioteer , who can bear witness to the apparition . But from that moment I have known that no spear or arrow or war club can touch me before my appointed time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he had no reason to invent such a tale for my amusement . Indeed , I hardly think he could have done so , being a man who believed only in what he could touch with his hands . On the third day Horemheb divided his troops , sending some back to Jerusalem with the plunder  --  for not many traders came to the battlefield itself after our slaves , cooking pots , and grain  --  and another party he sent to herd the grazing cattle . I had set up a camp for the wounded , which was guarded by a special platoon , but the greater number of the sick men died . Horemheb himself set off with his chariots in pursuit of the Khabiri , for by questioning the prisoners he had learned that the fugitives had contrived to rescue and carry away their god . He took me with him against my will , and I stood behind him126in the chariot , clutching him round the waist and wishing I had never been born . He drove like a maniac , and I thought every instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the stones . But he only scoffed and told me he would give me a taste of war since I had come to find out what it had to say to me . He gave me a taste of it : I saw the chariots sweep like a storm over the Khabiri  --  the happily singing , palm-waving Khabiri  --  as they drove their stolen cattle to their hiding place in the wilderness . His horses trampled down women and children and the aged ; he was wreathed in the smoke of burning tents ; and in blood and tears the Khabiri learned that it was better to live in poverty in the desert and starve to death in their dens than to raid wealthy , fertile Syria , that they might smear their sun-dried skins with oil and stuff themselves with stolen grain . Thus I tasted war  --  which was war no longer but persecutionand murder  --  till Horemheb himself had had enough and turning , ordered the setting up of the boundary stones that the Khabirihad thrown down . He had caught up with the Khabiri god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scattering the bearers who dropped it and fled . The image was later chopped up into firewood and burned before Sekhmet . The warriors smote their chests saying , " See how we burn the god of the Khabiri ! " The name of this god was Jehou or Jahveh ; it was the only one the raiders possessed , and they had to return bereft to the wilderness . They were thus poorer , for all their erstwhile palm waving and songs of joy , than when they had set out. 5Horemheb returned to Jerusalem , which was thronged with refugees from the border country , and he sold back to them their grain and cooking pots . At this they tore their clothes and cried , " These robbers are worse than the Khabiri ! " But they suffered no hardship , for they were able to borrow money from their temples , from the merchants , and from the tax gatherers , who had streamed into Jerusalem from all over Syria . Thus Horemheb converted the spoils into gold and silver , which he distributed among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died despite my care . There remained so much more booty for their comrades , who had also stolen the clothes and weapons and treasure of the sick and given them neither water nor food so that they perished . What wonder that unskilledI27surgeons were ever eager to follow the troops into battle or that , despite their incompetence , they returned so wealthy ! Jerusalem was full of noise and clamor and the din of Syrian instruments . The soldiers squandered the gold and silver on beer and girls till the traders , having thus regained their money , went away . Horemheblevied a tax upon the merchants both when they came and when they left and was thus a rich man though he had abstained from his share of the spoils . He felt no elation , and when I went to take leave of him before setting forth for Smyrna , he said , " This campaign was over before it began , and in his letter to me Pharaoh upbraids me for shedding blood against his commands . I must go back to Egypt with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keeping of the temple . But what will be the outcome I know not , for these are the only trained troops in Egypt , and the rest are fit for nothing but dirtyingwalls and pinching women 's rumps in the market place . By Ammon , it is easy enough in Pharaoh 's golden palace to write songs in honor of one 's god and to believe that all nations may be governed by love ! Could he but hear the screams of mutilated men and the wailingof women in the burning villages when the enemy crosses the borders , he might think otherwise . " " Egypt has no enemies ; she is too rich and too powerful , " I said . " Also your fame has gone out over Syria , and the Khabiri will not remove the landmarks a second time . Why then should you not disband the troops , for in truth they rage in their cups like wild beasts , their sleeping dens stink , and they are verminous . " " You know not what you say , " he retorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for even the commander 's hut was full of lice . " Egypt is self-sufficient and is therein mistaken . The world is large and in the hidden places seed is being sown from which fire and destruction will be harvested . I have heard , for example , that the King of the Amorites is diligently amassing horses and chariots , whereas it would be more becoming in him to pay his tribute to Pharaoh with greater punctuality . At his banquets his high officials talk only of how the Amorites once ruled the whole world  --  which is in a sense true , as the last of the Hyksos dwell in the land of Amurru . " " That Aziru is my friend and a vain man , for I gilded his teeth . And I think he has other things on his mind , for I have heard that he has taken a wife who draws the strength from his loins . " " You know many things , " remarked Horemheb , looking at me attentively . " You are a free man , an independent man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden from others . If I were in your place and free , I should journey into every country seeking knowledge . I should go to the land of Mitanni , and also Babylon , and learn what manner of war chariots the Hittites now use and how they exercise their troops . I should visit the islands in the sea to note how big the ships there are , of which there is so much talk . But my name is known throughout all Syria , and perhaps I should not hear so very much . But you , Sinuhe , are clad in Syrian clothes and speak a language known to the educated of all nations . You are also a physician , and no one would imagine that you understand anything outside your profession . Moreover , your talk is simple and to my ears often childish , and you have a wide-eyed look . Yet I know that your heart is locked and what you carry within you is known to none . Is n't this true ? " " Perhaps . But what is it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were to furnish you with a good supply of gold and send you to the lands I spoke of to practice your craft and spread the fame of both Egyptian medicine and your own healing powers ? The rich and influential  --  even kings , perhaps  --  would summonyou , and you would look into their hearts . While you followed your calling , you would let your eyes be mine and your ears mine so that when you returned to Egypt you might render me account of all you have seen and heard . " " I do not intend ever to return  --  and besides there is danger in what you propose . I have no desire to hang head downward from the wall of a foreign city . " " No one knows what tomorrow may bring . I think you will come back to Egypt , for he who has once drunk of Nile waters can not quench his thirst elsewhere . Even the swallows and the cranes return each winter . Gold is but dust to me , and I would rather exchange it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the buzz of flies in my ear . I do n't ask you to do ill or to break the laws of any place . Do n't all great cities lure the traveler to visit their temples  --  do they not prepare all manner of banquets and diversions to attract him and his gold ? You are welcome everywhere if you bring gold . " Your arts also are welcome in lands where they slay the aged with an ax and expose the sick in the desert to die , as you know is done . Kings are proud and love to parade their soldiers to impress the stranger . You do no evil in noting how the men march and in what manner they are armed , in counting chariots and bearing in mind whether they are large and heavy or small and light and whether128 129they carry two or three men  --  for I have heard that some employ a shield bearer as well as a charioteer . It is also important to note whether the troops are well fed and gleaming with oil or gaunt and verminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a rumor that the Hittites have discovered some new metal and that weapons made of this can chip the edges of the finest copper ax . Whether this is true I do n't know ; it is possible that they have discovered some new way of hardeningcopper . However it may be , I should like to know more . But above all I would learn the hearts of the rulers and of the counselors . Look at me ! " I looked at him , and he appeared to grow before my eyes . He was godlike , and his look was a burning coal so that my heart quailed and I bowed before him . He said , " Do you believe now that I am a man of authority ? " " My heart tells me that you can command me , but I do not know why this should be , " I faltered , and my tongue was thick in my mouth . " Doubtless it is true that you are destined to hold command over many , as you said . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my cars your ears . I do n't know whether you will gain by what I see and hear , for in the matters you would learn of I am a dunce . Yet I will do it as well as I may and not for gold but because you are my friend and because plainly the gods have so willed it  --  if indeed there be any gods . " He said , " I do n't think you will repent of being my friend . I will give you gold for your journey , nevertheless , for if I know anything of men , you will have need of it . You do not ask why this knowledge is more precious to me than gold , but this I can tell you : The great Pharaohs sent clever men to foreign courts , but the envoys of this Pharaoh are muttonhcads who know no more than how to pleat their robes and wear their honors and in what order they must stand on the right or left hand of Pharaoh . So pay no heed to them if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as the buzz of flies in your ear . " When we parted , he laid aside his dignity , stroked my cheek , and touched my shoulders with his face , saying , " My heart is heavy because of your going , Sinuhe , for if you are alone , why , so am I. No man knows the secrets of my heart . " I believe that as he said this his thoughts were with the Princess Baketamon whose beauty had bewitched him . He gave me much gold , more than I could have imagined  --  I believe he gave me all the gold he had won in the Syrian campaign  --  and he130furnished me with an escort as far as the coast so that I could travel without fear of robbers . As soon as I arrived there , I placed the gold with a large trading company , exchanging it for clay tablets , which were safer to carry , being useless to thieves , after which I boarded a ship for Smyrna. 131BOOK 6The Day of the False KingIBEFORE starting on a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I journeyed unmolested through many lands acquiring wisdom , for such a time will hardly come again . I traveled through a world that for forty years had known no war . Kings everywhere protected caravan routes and the traders who used them , while their ships and Pharaoh 's swept the seas of pirates . Frontiers were open ; merchants and travelers who brought gold were welcome in every city , and there was neither bitterness nor dissension between men ; they bowed to one another , stretching forth their hands at knee level , and learned one another 's ways . Many of the educated spoke several languagesand wrote two kinds of script . Fields were watered and bore abundant crops , and in the Red Lands the river of the heavens did duty for our Nile and refreshed the earth . In those days cattle roved in safety over the grazing grounds , and the herdsmen carried no spears but played on pipes and sang merry songs . Vineyards prospered , and fruit trees bowed beneath their burdens ; priests were fat and shiny with oil ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temples in every country . The gods throve also and were gracious and grew fat upon burnt offerings . The rich became richer , the mighty yet mightier , and the poor poorer , as the gods have decreed , so that all were content and there was no murmuring . Such is the vision I have of this bygone time  --  a time never to return  --  when in my young manhood my limbs were unwearied by long journeys , when my eyes were eager for new things , and when my heart , thirsting for knowledge , drank its fill . And now having praised the past when even the sun shone more brightly and the winds were gentler than in these evil days , I will tell of my journeys and of all I saw and heard . But first I must speak of my return to Smyrna . When I came home , Kaptah ran to meet me , shouting and weepingfor joy , and threw himself at my feet . " Blessed be the day that brings my lord home ! " he cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I believed positively that you had been slit open with a spear because you were heedless of my warnings and went forth to see what war is like . Truly our scarab is a powerful god and has protected you , and blessed is the day . My heart is full of gladness at the sight of you , and the gladness flows from my eyes in tears  --  for I can not restrain them though I fancied myself your heir and expected to take possession of all the gold you placed with the Smyrna merchants . Yet I do not grieve over this lost wealth , for without you I am like a kid that has lost its dam , and my days are dark . Nor have I stolen more from you than formerly but have guarded your house and property and all your interests so that you return richer than you went . " He washed my feet and poured water over my hands and tended me in every way with uninterrupted outcry till I ordered him to be silent . " Make speedy preparation , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take many years and that will be full of hardships ; we go to the land of Mitanni and to Babylon and to the islands in the sea . " Then Kaptah cried , " Now truly I wish that I had never been born into this world and also that I had never grown fat and prosperous , for the more fortunate a man is the harder is it for him to renounce his ease . Were you to set forth for a month or two , as you have done before , I should say nothing but remain peacefully here in Smyrna . But if your journey is to last for years , you may never return and I never see you again . Therefore , I must come with you , taking our sacred scarab . Against such hazards you will need all possible good fortune , and without the scarab you would tumble into crevasses on your way and be transfixed by the spears of robbers . But it would be better to remain at our house in Smyrna . " For Kaptah had grown more impudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our scarab and when paying for something said our gold . But I wearied of this , and of his lamentation , and said , " My heart tells me that one fine day you will hang by the heels from the wall for your insolence . Resolve , therefore , whether you will come with me or stay here  --  and above all cease this continual caterwauling when I would make ready for a long journey . " At this Kaptah fell silent and became resigned to his fate , and we made ready to depart . Since he had sworn never again to set foot aboard a ship , we joined a caravan that was on its way to northern Syria , for I desired to see the cedars of Lebanon , whence came the136timber for the palaces and for the sacred boat of Ammon . Of the journey there was little to say ; it was uneventful and no robbers attackedus . The inns were good , and we ate and drank well ; at one or two of the stopping places sick people came to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I had had enough of donkeys . Though the dry wind parched my face so that I must be forever rubbing in oil and though the dust choked me and the sand fleas tormented me , yet these seemed but petty trials , and my eyes rejoiced at all they saw . I saw forests of cedar and trees that were so huge that no Egyptian would believe me if I were to describe them . The fragrance of these woods was most marvelous , and the streams were clear , and it seemed to me that no one who lived in so beautiful a country could be altogetherunhappy . But that was before I saw the slaves who felled and stripped the timber to send it down the hillside to the seashore . The misery of these slaves was terrible to witness ; their arms and legs were covered with festering sores torn by the bark and by their tools , and on their backs the weals cut by the scourge were alive with flies . At last we came to the city of Kadesh , where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls of the fortress were unguarded , the defenses had crumbled , and both officers and men lived in the city with their families , remembering that they were warriors only on the days when grain and onions and beer were distributed from Pharaoh 's stores . We lingered in the city long enough for the riding sores on Kaptah 's backside to heal . I cured many sick people , for the Egyptian physicians in this place were incompetent , and their names must long have been erased from the Book of Life  --  if indeed they had ever been inscribed there . In this city I had a seal cut for me in a rare stone , as befitted my dignity ; for seals also differ from those in Egypt , being worn not in a ring but hung about the neck in the form of cylinders that , when rolled over the tablet , leave their impression in the clay . The poor and illiterate merely press their thumbs upon it  --  if they ever have occasion to make their mark . We continued our journey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to a river flowing upward instead of down as the Nile does . We were told that we were in the land of Mitanni , and we paid the travelers ' tax into the royal revenues . But because we were Egyptians , the people greeted us with respect , coming up to us in the street and saying : " We bid you welcome ; our hearts rejoice at the sight of Egyptians , for it is long since we beheld them . Our hearts also are uneasy , for137your Pharaoh has sent us no soldiers , no arms , and no gold ; and the rumor runs that he has offered to our king some new god of whom we know nothing , though we have already Ishtar of Nineveh and a number of others who have hitherto protected us . " They invited me to their houses and gave me food and drink , and they also served Kaptah because he was an Egyptian , though only my servant , so that he said to me , " This is a good land . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears that these people are ignorant and credulous and would be easy to deceive . " The King of Mitanni and his court had gone up into the mountainsfor the hot season . I had no desire to follow them there , being impatient to see the wonders of Babylon , of which I had heard so much . But I did as floremheb had commanded me and spoke with the great ones and with the humble ; all told the same tale ; all were uneasy . The land of Mitanni had formerly been powerful , but now it seemed a land floating in the air , walled in by Babylon in the east , by savage tribes in the north , and in the west by the Hittites , the name of whose country was Hatti . The more I heard of the Hittites , who were greatly feared , the firmer became my resolve to journey to the land of Hatti also , but first I desired to visit Babylon . The inhabitants of the land of Mitanni were small of stature , their women were beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had been a mighty people in their time , for they said that they had once ruled over the peoples of the north and the south , the east and the west  --  but that is what every nation says . Ever since the time of the great Pharaohs this country had been dependent upon Egypt , and for two generations the daughters of its king had dwelt as wives in Pharaoh 's golden house . By listening to the talk and the complaint of the Mitannians , I came to understand that their country had been designed as a shield for Syria and Egypt against the might of Babylon and of the savage peoples , to receive in its body the spears aimed at Pharaoh 's sovereignty . For this reason , and this reason alone , the Pharaohs propped up the king 's tottering throne and sent him gold , arms , and mercenaries . But the people did not understand this , and they were exceedingly proud of their country and its power . I saw that it was a weary and declining nation with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaware of this , and they paid more attention to their food , preparing it in many remarkable ways ; they also squandered their time in trying on new clothes  --  their pointed shoes and tall hats  --  and they were particular in the choosing of jewelry . Their limbs were slender like those of the Egyptians , and the138women 's complexions were so transparent that one might see the blood flowing blue in their veins . They spoke and behaved with delicacyand were taught in their childhood to walk gracefully , men as well as women . To live here was pleasant ; even in the pleasure houses there was no brawling : all was silence and discretion so that I felt clumsy when I frequented them and drank my wine there . Yet my heart was heavy , for I had seen war and knew that if all that was said of the land of Hatti was true , then Mitanni was doomed . Their medicine also was of a high standard , and their physicians skillful men who knew their trade and also a great deal that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for expelling worms that was far less troublesome and unpleasant than any I had met with before . They could also cure blindness with the needle , and in this also I became more proficient . But they knew nothing of skull opening and said that only the gods could cure head injuries  --  and that even then the patients were never the same again so that it was better for them to die . Nevertheless , the people were curious ; they came to see me and brought their sick , being attracted by anything strange . Just as they loved to wear foreign clothes and jewelry and eat exotic dishes and drink imported wine , so they desired to be treated by an alien physician . Women came also and smiled upon me and told me of their maladies and complained that their men were lazy and tired and withoutvirility . I understood well enough what they were after but was careful not to give way to them , for I did not wish to offend against the laws of a foreign land . Instead I gave them drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained such drugs as would set even a dead man rutting from the doctors in Smyrna , the Syrians being the cleverest in the world in this matter and their medicines more powerful than those of Egypt . But whether the women gave these drugs to their husbands or to quite other men I do not know , though I fancy they preferred strangers , for they were free in their ways . Few of them had children , which again was a sign to me that the shadow of death hung over their land . I must mention that these people no longer knew the boundaries of their own kingdom since the boundary stones were constantly being moved . The Hittites bore them away in their chariots and set them up where they pleased . If the Mitannians protested , the Hittites laughed and challenged them to put them back again if that was their desire . But that was not their desire , for if what was told of the Hittiteswas true , there had never on this earth been seen so cruel ,      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
