txt Selection of a running mate for President Truman became a wideopen race today with the announced withdrawal of Supreme Court Justice William 0 . Douglas on whom the Democratic high command had counted to strengthen the national ticket . The immediate effect of the Douglas decision was to put Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky in the forefront of a large field of Vice Presidential prospects that included Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney of Wyoming , Gov . Mon C. Wallgren of Washington and forimer Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas . Although sentiment behind the Kentucky Senator was far from bandwagon proportions , there was a growing belief among leaders of the larger delegations that the nomination would go to him . At the same time some Democratic strategists clung to the hope that Justice Douglas might yet permit his name to be brought before the convention . His statement that he had not been and had not planned to be a candidate and that he did not plan to resign from the Supreme Court was not universally accepted as foreclosing his nomination for the Vice Presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas ' statement at La Grande , Ore. , was one of personal preference rather than a final refusal . Although Chairman J. Howard regarded the statement as equivalent to that issued by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , many insisted that Justice Douglas ' attitude might be changed by a personal appeal from President Truman . Close personal friends of the Justice who talked with him on the telephone tonight reported that he had not intended his La Grande statement as an irrevocable " no , " but had yet to be persuaded of the wisdom of becoming President Truman 's running mate . It thus became apparent that only an appeal from the President in the name of the party could swing Mr. Douglas around to an attitude of availability . Among those predicting the selection of Senator Barkley was Leslie Biffle , secretary of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee and i. timate of President Truman , who ha , a reputation of being right more often than wrong on such matters . In addition to being " acceptable " to President Truman , Mr. Biffle said , Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " certainly " would be placed in nomination . Senator Brian of Connecticut joined Mr. Biffle , sergeant at arms of the convention , in this prediction . There was general agreement among party wheelhorses that the nomination of Senator Barkley would help placate Southern factions that have been loudest in their opposition to the candidacy of President Truman . From various Southern delegations came reports of Mr. Barkley 's acceptability . Senator Barkley 's age ? he will be 71 on inauguration day  --  was mentioned as a factor operating against his nomination . But there were those like Mayor David Lawrence of Pittsburgh , a national committeeman , who were telling any who would listen that " a man is only as old as he feels " and that Senator Barkley had plenty of vigor despite his years . Truman Staying Aloof Meanwhile , President Truman was keeping " hands off " the maneuvering on the Vice Presidential nomination , at least for the present . Chairman said that Mr. Truman probably would have something to say on the matter in a few days but thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with the White House said that President Truman wanted to get the reaction of delegates on potential running mates before reaching a decision . He had already settled on Justice Douglas as the candidate that would add the most to the ticket and it remained to be seen whether he would accept Mr. Douglas 's statement of his position as final . Colonel Jacob M. Arvey , the Chicago leader who helped organize the pre-convention stop-Truman movement , was among those who rallied to the Barkley standard . Earlier he had given his endorsement to Justice Douglas but pointed to the Kentuckian when Mr. Douglas declared himself out of the running . News of the Douglas announcement was followed by a statement from Senator O'Mahoney that his name would be placed in nomination for the Vice Presidency by Gov . Lester C. Hunt of Wyoming . He said it would be a " winning team , " recalling that he and Hunt had been successful in 1934 when Mr. O'Mahoney was sent to the Senate and Mr. Hunt became Secretary of State in Wyoming . During the afternoon a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution suggesting Senator O'Mahoney for the Vice-Presidential nomination . It was made clear , however , that the endorsement was complimentary and not binding on the more than 200 delegates supporting the resolution . States represented included Colorado , Nebraska , Montana , Wyoming , Kansas , Iowa , Wisconsin , Michigan , North Dakota and Utah . Tracy S. McCraken , national committeeman from Wyoming , said Missouri was not represented and was not sure whether South Dakota and Oklahoma had delegates present . I The conference resolution described Senator O'Mahoney as " a great liberal and effective spokesman of the common man who , uniquely , has the admiration , the respect and the support of labor , agriculture and business alike . " At a press conference this afternoon , Chairman recalled that Justice Douglas had asked him several months ago to use his influence to prevent his name being brought before the convention because it would only cause him embarrassment . At the same time , the Democratic chairman told friends privately that he did not consider himself bound by a three-month-old conversation with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the Douglas nomination . Whether Justice Douglas may be prevailed upon ultimately to accept the Vice Presidential nomination , Chairman said his ; election by the convention was out of the question unless and until he let it be known that it was acceptable to him . " I do n't think he will be nominated unless he consents , " said Mr. . " I do n't think anyone wants to repeat the mistake they made on Eisenhower in pressing his candidacy before learning whether he was available . " Mr. declined an invitation to run through his list of possible vice presidential nominees . The list was long and he might offend by forgetting to mention one or two , he said . The list continued to lengthen after Justice Douglas ' withdrawal announcement . Former Mayor Edward Kelly of Chicago suggested Senator Scott Lucas of Illinois as the ideal candidate . But his chances were discounted by those who remembered his votes for the Taft-Hartley Act and for the Republican tax reduction program .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
