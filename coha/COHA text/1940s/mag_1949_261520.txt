AMERICA AND COSMIC MAN ( 247 pp. ) - Wyndham Lewis-Doubleday ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> When a girl has spent a lot of time and money fixing her face , it is tough to run slap into a wacky stranger who declares that he has fallen in love with her at first sight because she has the world 's muddiest skin and largest pores . Should she decide that any compliment , no matter how disconcerting , is better than no compliment at all ? Or should she tell the adoring stranger to mind his own damn business ? <P> U.S. readers will find themselves facing this uncomfortable decision again &; again as they read ( Percy ) Wyndham Lewis* passionate hymn of praise to the face of their country . For Lewis , who once edited a ferocious avant-garde magazine entitled Blast , is Britain 's quirkiest , most anarchical man of letters , and his point of view is always so unconventional that most people would feel safer at being in his bad books than in his good ones . In The Apes of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with rip-roaring violence ; in Time and Western Man ( 1928 ) he sought to " heal and reinvigorate " the ailing body of Western civilization with bursts of high-voltage shock treatment . But now , aged 64 , Lewis has decided that most of the Western species is as far beyond succor as Cro-Magnon Man , and he has fallen madly in love with " that wonderful country , " the U.S.A. <P> Great Big Promiscuous You . Lewis ' new book , based on a number of trips to the U.S. and a great deal of reading , may serve as a handy companion to Poet T.S . Eliot 's recent Notes Towards the Definition of Culture ( TIME , March 21 ) . The two men agree in their diagnosis of contemporary cultural trends-and draw totally opposite conclusions . The religious decline deplored by Eliot does not ruffle Lewis , who believes that " Christianity , as a unifier , became a bad joke long ago . " The loss of regional differences and " roots , " lamented by Eliot , is a joy to Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go looking around for a root . " <P> He regards the U.S. as destined to be a " great big promiscuous grave into which tumble , and there disintegrate , all that was formerly race , class , or nationhood . " Many Americans share with Eliot his fear of the standardizing power of technology and mass education ; Lewis relishes the prospect of " one intellectual and emotional standard " which he hopes will soon make " the inhabitant of Mexico City . . . indistinguishable from the dweller in Montreal . " <P> Love that Dirt . One thing wrong with Americans , in Lewis ' view , is that most of them fail to realize what a magnificent future they are building . Tied to petty , European standards of measurement , Americans keep thinking that they are a great nation , instead of " an advance copy " of the " rootless Elysium " that is to come . They worry because their cities are " irresponsible , dirty , corrupt , " when in Lewis ' opinion such conditions are " like nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gregarious habits and glad-handedness , when , as Lewis sees it , they should be reveling in their " beautiful human impulse to befriend , to treat all men as brothers .
