When he released the confidential letters which precipitated last month 's revolt of the admirals , Captain John G. Crommelin broke a whole lockerful of Navy rules &; regulations , was duly suspended from duty . Both Defense Secretary Louis Johnson and Navy Secretary Francis Matthews were hot for court-martialing him . Last week Admiral Forrest P. Sherman , the new Chief of Naval Operations , decided on a smarter , less severe move . <P> He argued that Airman Crommelin was famous as a flyer and fighting man , and that Crommelin 's impetuous and reckless revolt against civilian control had made him the darling of half the officers in the service . It seemed quite possible that a court-martial might make him both a hero and a martyr . It was certain to stir up new publicity ( Lieut . Commander Walter Winchell , U.S.N.R. , had rushed a New York lawyer to Washington to defend Crommelin ) . <P> Airman Sherman called in Crommelin and announced his verdict . Crommelin was to get a stiff letter of reprimand , and would be transferred away forthwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as aviation officer on the staff of Vice Admiral George D. Murray , Commander of the Western Sea Frontier . That was all . But in the letter of reprimand , Crommelin was sternly told that his defiance of his superiors had " brought into question your fitness to exercise command or to occupy a position of trust and confidence . " <P> That statement in Crommelin 's personnel file made it almost certain that he would not be promoted to rear admiral ( he was the second ranking airman in line ) by the selection board which meets this week . It also greatly diminished his chances of ever attaining flag rank .
