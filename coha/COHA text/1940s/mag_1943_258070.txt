On one Irish matter there is no argument in all Eire : the favorite Irish newspaper columnist is Brian O'Nolan , who writes for Dublin 's Irish Times . He is small , dark , young ( 31 ) . The impish O'Nolan , a novelist , playwright and civil servant , writes a six-a-week column titled Cruiskeen Lawn ( The Little Overflowing Jug ) under the pseudonym Myles na gCopaleen ( pronounced Copaleen , means Myles of the Little Horses ) . * <P> There is nothing like Cruiskeen Lawn or its author anywhere in English or American journalism . His column is written in what O'Nolan describes as " socalled English " three days of the week ; in " the kingly and melodious Irish " on the other three . It is as atmospheric of Dublin as the flower- &-vegetable; women of Moore Street , or the giant Nelson 's pillar which keeps a bleak eye socket on the drizzled city . Because he works as Assistant Principal , Local Government and Public Health officer all week , O'Nolan writes all six columns on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce , O'Nolan is a master of the monstrous pun . Erudite , ironic , he devotes many a column to the hilarious systematic destruction of literary cliches , to parodies of Eire 's leprechaun literature and the red-taped verbiage of Government service , to absurd home-economics hints . He is an unsparing , beloved critic of devotees of Irish , who overuse Eire 's national tongue ; a subtler critic of the clerics , who are not unaware of his innuendo and high irony . <P> A standard section of O'Nolan 's column is a paragraph or two of bogus Keatsiana , in which he hangs most of his laboriously manufactured puns on the poet and his " friend " Chapman . Samples : <P> &gt; Chapman and Keats went on tour with a pair of performing bears . Keats refused to believe they were tame and harmless , but consented to feed them . Chapman found Keats injecting a local anesthetic into the bears . They were numb but upright . " Chapman flew into a feverish temper and demanded the reason for this brutal and cynical outrage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " <P> &gt; In his youth Keats was a well-known amateur veterinary . An old lady brought him a sick cat , whose bladder Keats re moved . " ' A case of letting the bag out of the cat , ' he remarked afterwards to Chap man . " <P> &gt; Keats 's Irish terrier , Byrne , failed to come home one night . Chapman found the poet playing the violin , and remarked on his composure . " Keats smiled . . . ' And why should I not fiddle , ' he asked , ' while Byrne roams ? ' " <P> &gt; Keats was once a potato factor and , while delivering a ton of potatoes , was attacked by a ferocious pet pomeranian . <P> He kicked the dog and carried on . " ' When I make up my mind to deliver spuds , ' he remarked afterward to Chapman , ' I have no intention of letting a pomme de terre me . ' Chapman took no notice . " The Retort Discourteous . O'Nolan is in a class by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One column explained the use of an obsolete snow gauge ( complete with woodcut ) .
