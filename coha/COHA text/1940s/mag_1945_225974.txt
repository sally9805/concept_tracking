One day last week a gunman drifted into Chicago 's North Side , hunting funds he needed to settle a domestic problem ( springing his wife from jail ) . But he got tangled up with the police , and by the time the shooting stopped he was dead . So was a detective . Chicago , long accustomed to small-arms fire , paid little heed . But when police discovered that the dead gangster was from Detroit , Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly almost blew a gasket . Cried he : " I 'm tired of these hoodlums coming in here from neighboring areas and giving Chicago a bad name ! "
