The Administration is going to have another fling at making sense of its patchwork of press and information bureaus . Plans for it were cooking last week . It was a plan of Rooseveltian caliber ; and it added more alphabet to the soup . <P> To cure the confusion of agencies within agencies , and agencies without any connections , working enthusiastically at cross-purposes , a new and better agency would be created . On top of the Coordinator of Information , on top of the information section of the Office for Emergency Management , on top of the Rockefeller Committee , on top of the Office of Facts &; Figures , a new office would be set up . <P> Its probable name : the Office of War Information ( OWI ) . Its job : to supersede the information services of all the others , to act as an issuing office , frankly putting out the stories that the Government wants published . <P> Most of Washington believed that the President 's choice for the job was amiable News Analyst Elmer Davis . An able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had one worthwhile qualification : nobody in Washington has any particular reason for disliking him . But he was said to have refused the job . Mr. Davis said it was n't so . ( " I 'm not in the habit of refusing jobs that are not offered to me . " ) <P> But Davis or no Davis , rumors or no rumors , plans were in the making for a super press bureau - something that , in the terminology of other countries , might be called a Ministry of Information &; Propaganda .
