JIM DANDY takes place in all or part of a transparent egg shell which is broken and open along one side . Inside the shell are miserable and majestic ruins . These ruins represent immemorial and immediate reality , as thrown together by time , nature , art , religion , labor , science , invention , plan , accident , violence of war , and wear and tear of weather . The play happens as if everybody in it had survived pestilence , famine , ignorance , injustice , inhumanity , torture , crime and madness . In short , as if everybody in it were human . Prolonged suffering has given everybody in the play dignity , humor and simplicity . Everybody in the play is a miracle . A large copper plate on the librarian 's work counter names the ruins The Public Library . They are given their place in time in the engraving in stone at the base of the Doric column , broken in half by lightning or explosives , deep in a corner of the egg : Now or Never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A slender but strong tree with one strong branch stands across the stage from the Doric column . Near it a rose- tree standing in a patch of dry grass struggles for life with rocks and cement . The rose-tree has leaves but no flowers . There is a disengaged stairway of nine steps near the tree . At the center of the egg is the back end of a small jail with a second-floor window of steel bars . Standing at the window , in the striped jacket of the convict , is JIM SMITHER , a young man . He looks down at the people who are free , whistling softly : Careless Love . Falling brick has made a large Gothic arch directly beneath the jail window , which leads to a dark cave inhabited by a small boy and a small girl , LITTLE JOHNNY and LITTLE MOLLY . Hugging , they stand at the edge of the cave , looking out . They wear clothing made of scraps of fur and clusters of tree leaves . In her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shy and fearful as animals , and their eyes are enormous with love , hope , alarm , and anxiety . A small circle-shaped platform with three steps all around is a little to one side of the center of the egg . On the platform is a chair with a high carved back and handsomely carved arms and legs . A king might have sat in the chair at one time , but now sitting on the edge of it , uncomfortable and tense and out of place , is a lean man in the depths of despair whose name is FISHKIN . Resting on his knees is a large book bound in white leather . He is out-at-elbow but as neat as possible in a cheap suit of clothing . His face is like a hatchet , his neck and fingers long and thin . Reclining on a divan of faded purple velvet which rises three feet off the floor is FLORA , a woman no longer young but still beautiful , who wears a preposterous tight-fitting gown of red silk . Over her left breast is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around her neck is a tight collar of silver . High on her right arm is a plain flat bracelet of gold , with one jewel set in it . Her long black hair is combed straight back and tied in two braids . Near the end of each braid a small white ribbon is tied . She wears shining black stockings , and elevated shoes of silver . Her round full face has been covered with cream , powder and paint . Her chin is cupped in one hand , as if she were Cleopatra on an open boat on the River Nile . She is voluptuous , dreamy , desperate , wasted , pathetic , batty , and a delight to behold . Before her is the librarian 's work counter , upon the far end of which rests an enormous cash register . The counter is about the same height and length as the divan , but it stands a foot or two deeper in the egg . Near the far end of the counter is a large water jar on a metal frame , and attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper cups . TOMMY SINGH , in uniform , stands with rifle at parade rest beside a vertical house the size of a telephone booth . The house has a pointed roof in which is set a flag on a pole . The house or booth is open on one side . It stands deep in the shell . In it is a bench or shelf on which TOMMY sits now and then to smoke a cigarette . On the bench is a stringed instrument of ancient design . TOMMY thrashes the length and breadth of the stage at regular intervals ; halts ; brings his rifle from his shoulder to parade rest ; salutes ; rests ; returns the rifle to his shoulder ; about-faces ; and thrashes again . When he rests , he does so as if he were still keeping time . He thrashes about as if he were guarding the St. James Palace in London . His marching is authentic , impressive , ridiculous , but good to see . He is a tall wiry man of middle years with a sternly-fixed boyish Asiatic face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small house , takes up the stringed instrument , strums upon it softly , and sings native tunes . A glass revolving door , of the sort and size used by hotels and department stores , stands out in the open , deep in the egg . The glass around this door is stained and designed into the principal Biblical themes , including A Child Shall Lead Them . On top of the door is a glass globe of the world which lights up when the door is turned , revealing the blue of oceans and the brown and green of islands and continents . To the outermost edge of each of the door 's four partitions is attached a wire-metal-and-glass sculpture , each of a man and a woman , each different in size and design . These sculptures move and bend when the door is turned . Beyond the sculptures , inward along the partitions , small bells of all sorts and sizes and tones , including sleigh bells , and clusters of strips of thin colored glass , hang from wires , and ring and tinkle when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yellow , blue and green . MOLLY , who might be an old Russian peasant woman in black rags and black shawl , moves slowly around the outside of the glass door , studying the pictures of animals and men and grass and plants and trees and water and fish and sun and moon and stars . Now and then she stops suddenly , as if in terror looking back and all around . Finally , she discovers the entrance into the door ( which is also the exit ) . She gives the door a trial push , hears the music of the bells and glass , and stands back until silence returns . She enters the door , pushes once around , and gets out , apparently frightened . She enters the door again and slowly pushes around in it , gradually increasing her speed until the door is almost whirling and the music of the bells and glass is wild and a little mad . An old circus wagon with only one front wheel intact has been propped up on apple boxes on which names and initials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drawn . The other front wheel lies under the wagon . Over the sign of the wagon which formerly identified the animal in the cage a long piece of cardboard has been tacked and on the cardboard has been printed : Jim the Maharajah , Secrets , 5 . THE MAHARAJAH , a tall young man , wears a turban of white silk in which a large star and crescent of imitation silver set with imitation rubies is pinned . He wears a prize-fighter 's robe of light green , on the back of which has been sewn in white cloth : Kid Jim . In his wagon he has an assortment of small hand drums and a tambourine , one or another of which he takes up now and then and drums upon with his fingers . In his wagon he also has a triangle , several toy flutes , and whistles of several kinds . GIBBON , in a cheap three-piece suit , but without hat or shoes , sits under the wagon . His face is not unlike the face of a man , but he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and feet are covered with coarse hair . He is smoking a large curved pipe . When GIBBON is at ease , he walks on his hind legs , his trunk bent forward and his long arms dangling , but when he hurries he goes on all fours . If he is frightened he runs to the tree and tries to hide behind it , moaning . An old upright piano with its front boards gone stands near swinging doors made of wood and glass under an arch of Gothic design which leads to a street . The arch is slim and high and would appear to contain bells . The swinging doors might have belonged to a saloon when the accident or miracle which threw everything together in Jim Dandy took place . Seated at the piano , staring at its insides , is JOHNNY , a man in his early thirties who wears a black turtle-neck sweater under the black coat of his suit . He resembles a young priest . He is deeply relaxed in face and body , and when he moves he does so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all the time in the world and yet must hurry a little , or as if he did not want to disturb a meaningful rhythm he had discovered in time , and yet must keep the rhythm lithe and supple and perhaps purposeful . He speaks in the same way that he moves , but it is always as if he were restraining laughter . Beside the piano is a broken-down couch on which a runaway Eurasian girl of seventeen or eighteen with long disheveled black hair is trying to rest . She is a pretty girl , but grim and bewildered . She wears a boy 's blue jeans with the legs rolled up almost to her knees , red boots , and a boy 's white shirt with two buttons open at the collar . The shirt falls over her trousers . A clean white cloth , the size and shape of a dish-drying cloth , now tied around her neck , she sometimes uses as a covering for her head . When the play begins the bells and glass of the revolving door are heard as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door itself is not seen . Next , the man in jail is heard whistling , and gradually he is seen standing at the window . Now , the Maharajah 's drums are heard in accompaniment , and gradually he is seen in his wagon . Next , Tommy 's strumming is heard , and he is seen putting down the stringed instrument and taking up his rifle and thrashing nine paces , halting , facing about , and thrashing back . Now , a girl 's weeping is heard , and the runaway girl is seen sitting on the couch . After a moment , she lies back on the couch . Beginning softly the prisoner sings Careless Love , as FLORA is seen reclining on the divan . GIBBON is seen smoking his pipe , which he takes out of his mouth as he just barely moans . The children of the cave step a little out of the cave , dance half a minute or so , but grow frightened and run back silently . When the prisoner stops singing the runaway girl sits up again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNNY and LITTLE MOLLY tiptoe out of the cave toward her , but soon run back very swiftly . GIBBON is frightened by the weeping and moves to the tree and moans . JOHNNY stands and reaches out to the girl . She gets to her feet , and then wanders off through the swinging doors , as if asleep . Now , the whole scene is dimly visible , including the revolving door , around which MOLLY is moving , looking at the pictures in stained glass . She is going around inside the door when JOCK , a wild little man in a zoot suit , comes in through the swinging doors . His entrance is an enormous leap which delights GIBBON , who comes from behind the tree to be near him . JOCK leaps again , runs , halts , hoofs , slides , and halts again . He looks around at everybody , then shouts . ARIMATHEA Papa 's in jail ! Mama 's on bail ! Baby 's on the cornerShouting pussy for sale ! p. 3 GIBBON Hey ! Bobareebob ! ( JOCK collapses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bob ? JOCK opens the book he has brought with him and tries to read . GIBBON crowds him to get a look at the book . Suddenly JOCK slams the book shut , gets to his feet wearily , and goes to the librarian 's counter . He throws three kisses to FLORA , and GIBBON throws three kisses to her . FLORA gets off the divan and stands behind the counter . FLORA Must n't throw kisses in the public library . ARIMATHEA Well , all right , but give me another book ! This book 's about kings and queens . I never met a queen in my life , and I know I 'm not a king , but I saw a king once in a newsreel . What a phony ! The guy did n't even know how to dress . The king had no class , so give me another book . Give me something about bacteria ! Give me something that wo n't make me feel so inferior . Give me something to make me proud of my family , my name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my country , my religion , my Wassermann negative . FLORA Must n't yatatata , yatatata , yatatata in the public library . ARIMATHEA Well , all right , but take this imitation book and give me the real article . ( He leans forward to glance behind FLORA ) Give me a book about cave drawings . ( He sneaks another look ) Give me a book about Egyptian sculpture . ( His right hand trembles with longing to hold her as he makes a staccato sound of controlled passion , half grunt , half whistle , after which he looks longingly into her face ) Oh , woman , woman ! Give me something about the trials and tribulations of the first eye-witness ! ( Suddenly , wearily ) No . I 'm tired . Just give me a book about roses , and let me rest . How did roses ever happen ? p. 4 FLORA ( Stamping the book and Jock 's library card ) Very well , but this book is two days overdue . The fine is two cents , one cent a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Jock Arimathea . And I 'll pay . ( He flips a coin into the air , catches it in the palm of his right hand , smacks it onto the back of his left hand , and looks at it ) Tails ! Another war , no doubt . ( He slaps the coin on the counter ) FLORA Must n't throw money around in the public library . ARIMATHEA Call that money ? A jitney ? A nickel ? How did money ever happen ? What 's it mean ? What 's it for ? ( He examines the coin ) Now here 's the Indian and here 's the buffalo . Here 's moolah , cash , and dough , but what does it mean ? And why the hell does n't it grow on trees ? O.K. , sister , take my last nickel , to pay my fine . ( He drops the coin on the counter ) Now , give me my change . FLORA Very well , sir . FLORA presses down on one of the keys of the cash register whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all sorts of metal parts in the cash register click and clash and mesh and shift about , and finally the drawer comes out . p. 5 GIBBON Hah hah hah ! Is that all that happens ? FLORA Must n't laugh at the cash register in the public library . GIBBON Yes , ma'am . Would you please give me a book about people ? FLORA Have you a library card ? ARIMATHEA Just a minute , please . One customer at a time . I 've got change coming . FLORA Very well . Here 's your change . You gave me five cents . Your fine was two cents . ( Counting and dropping pennies one at a time into Jock 's outstretched hand ) Two and one is three , and one is four , and one is five . ( She reaches behind her and takes a book from a shelf ) And here 's a book about roses . ( She stamps the book and Jock 's library card , and hands the book to him ) Thank you , and come again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He collapses and GIBBON bends over him ) GIBBON What 's the matter , Bob ? ARIMATHEA My name 's Jock Arimathea and I 'm tired , that 's what 's the matter . ( He opens the book and looks into it and speaks slowly ) How did books ever happen ? ( He sprawls on his back ) p. 6 FLORA ( Leaning over the counter , to GIBBON ) Have you a card , sir ? GIBBON No , ma'am . FLORA Ca n't borrow books from the public library without a card . GIBBON I 've got to borrow books . I 've been around people all my life , but I ca n't understand them . Why are n't people decent animals ? Why are people proud ? How can I get a card ? FLORA ( Handing him a long white sheet of paper with printing on it ) Fill out this questionnaire and have it signed by three members of the public library in good standing . GIBBON Yes , ma'am . ( He bends over JOCK again ) What 's the matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you sign this piece of paper for me , so I can borrow books about people ? ARIMATHEA ( He puts his arms around GIBBON ) Listen , Gibbon ! Take my advice and do n't start reading . Forget books . Forget people . Leave them alone . Reading makes a man sick and tired . GIBBON I 've got to find out about people . I want to read every book ever written about them . p. 7 ARIMATHEA Do n't do it , Gibbon . Take my advice and stay unconscious . You do n't have to find out about people . Be yourself , Gibbon . Do n't be a fool like me . ( GIBBON sniffles and moans ) Now do n't cry . I guess I 've read half the books in this public library , but what good has it done me ? No good at all . Take my advice as a friend and do n't start reading . GIBBON You 're no friend of mine , Jock Arimathea . You 're like all the others , and I hate you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . You act as if you know more than I 'll ever know , but I 've forgotten more than you 'll ever know . You 're snobs , too . Every man I 've ever met has been a snob . You do n't have to be a snob , too , do you ? Please sign this piece of paper , so I can be a member of the public library and read books and find out about people . I do n't want to hate you , I just ca n't help it . Please put your name on this piece of paper . ARIMATHEA ( Getting up ) No . I 'm not going to put my name on that piece of paper because I do n't want you to make a fool of yourself . GIBBON Why do n't you want me to make a fool of myself ? I 'll tell you why . Because you are a snob . Because you think making a fool of myself is too good for me . Well , let me tell you something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool of myself as any man in the world . p. 8 ARIMATHEA Ah , poor Gibbon ! ( JOCK climbs the disengaged stairs and sits and reads ) GIBBON Do n't poor Gibbon me ! I 'm just as rich as you are . ( He goes to the circus wagon and looks in at THE MAHARAJAH ) Here 's a nickel . Give me a secret , please . ( THE MAHARAJAH takes the nickel and clangs the triangle in his wagon to attract attention , then shakes the tambourine ) MAHARAJAH ( Shouting ) Oyla , shoyla , boyla ! ( He beats a drum ) Ooban , dooban , doo-loo-loo-loo , loo ! The Maharajah gives the world another secret ! ( He hands GIBBON a sealed envelope . GIBBON goes to one side , tears open the envelope , takes out a folded sheet of paper , unfolds it and studies it ) GIBBON ( Reading ) Love . Love . Love ! Three times . What 's that mean ? What kind of a secret is that ? ( Suddenly shouting ) Love ? Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To THE MAHARAJAH ) This secret 's a lie . Give me another secret , or give me my money back . MAHARAJAH One nickel , one secret . No exchanges , no refunds . GIBBON Love ! Do you love me ? Why do n't you practice what you preach ? I hate you ! I hate everybody ! p. 9 SMITHER Hey , Gibbon ! I love you ! GIBBON Oh no you do n't ! You 're a criminal in jail . How do I know what terrible crime you 've committed ? SMITHER ( Crushed and lonely ) I 'm innocent . As God 's my witness , I 'm innocent . I love everybody . I 'd hug everybody in the world if I could get to them . I 'm innocent . GIBBON Ah ! That 's what they all say . If you were innocent , you would n't be in jail . ( He lies down in front of the circus wagon and studies the secret ) ( JIM SMITHER sings Nobody Loves a Man in Jail ) Nobody loves a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody knows what innocence isUntil he 's been taught . Nobody loves the poor outlaw ; Nobody loves the man who fell ; Nobody knows what heaven isUntil he 's been in hell . Nobody knows what freedom isUntil it 's taken away ; Nobody knows what living isUntil his dying day Innocence is guilt undone ; Heaven 's hell put back in place ; Freedom 's bondage broken from ; Living 's death in dire disgrace . He sings very slowly . He pauses sometimes for so long that one imagines he has stopped singing , but he takes the song up again . MOLLY comes out of the revolving door and stands looking up at him and listening . THE MAHARAJAH accompanies his singing on one of his toy flutes . This singing continues as counterpoint to the main action on the stage . It stops a moment or two before JIM SMITHER speaks again . GIBBON makes a paper airplane out of the questionnaire . He sails it , and it falls near JOHNNY who picks it up and after a moment sails it in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must n't throw paper airplanes in the public library . JOHNNY Why not ? FLORA Must n't disturb the readers in the public library . JOHNNY ( Looks around at the readers : JOCK , sitting at the top of the disengaged steps reading the book about roses ; GIBBON under the circus wagon reading the five-cent secret ; and FISHKIN on the platform , on the edge of the big chair , poring over the big book . His eyes rest on FISHKIN a moment , then he turns back to FLORA ) Him ? That impostor of a man ? Do you call him a reader ? ( Suddenly , shouting ) Hey , you ! Impostor ! ( FISHKIN slips off the edge of the chair ) FISHKIN ( His voice high-pitched ) Who ? Me ? JOHNNY Yes , you . What are you reading ? FISHKIN ( Picks up the book and gets to his feet ) I 'm reading The Bible . The Book of Genesis . JOHNNY The Bible ?

I 'm your friend , see ? I 'm the best friend you 've got . FLORA Must n't argue in the public library . FISHKIN This man has taken my book . JOHNNY Your book ? FISHKIN Yes , my book . JOHNNY How do you figure ? FISHKIN I 've read the book from cover to cover three times . Sometimes I almost believe I wrote it . Somebody wrote it , and it was surely somebody who knew me . I know most of the book by heart . That 's how I figure . JOHNNY That 's very interesting . Why do you keep reading the book all the time ? FISHKIN I do n't know . At any rate , I ca n't tell you . Just give me back my book , please . ( Suddenly , his voice pathetic with pleading ) Librarian , please ask the thief to give me back my book . FLORA ( To JOHNNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library . JOHNNY Why not ? What 's wrong with a little crying ? p. 12 FISHKIN ( Almost sobbing ) I 'm not crying . Why do you say I 'm crying ? I 'm not crying . I 'm not ! JOHNNY Watch your manners , please . Do n't make a liar out of the librarian . You are crying , but even if you were n't , common courtesy would forbid your saying so . You are crying , and I 'm all for it because I 'm your friend , see ? Just do n't tell the librarian you 're not crying when she says you are . It 's not nice . Must n't be discourteous in the public library . FISHKIN I 'm sorry , librarian . Perhaps I was crying and did n't know it . If so , I 'm sorry . Can I help it if I 'm miserable ? JOHNNY What are you miserable about ? FISHKIN None of your business . JOHNNY That 's not a nice way to talk to a friend . FISHKIN You 're not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused ) Listen , you ! When I tell you I 'm a friend , I 'm a friend , see ? So do n't try to tell me I 'm an enemy . Do n't try to tell me whose friend I am and whose friend I 'm not . Let me choose my friends in my own way . ( Almost laughing ) I 'd give up my life for you . p. 13 FISHKIN I do n't want anybody to give up his life for me . JOHNNY Is that so ? Why not ? FISHKIN Because I 'm not worth it . JOHNNY Oh , you 're worth my life , do n't worry about that . I 've got one foot in the grave already . FLORA ( To FISHKIN ) Here 's another book , sir . The Oxford Book of English Poetry . FISHKIN ( His voice pathetic again ) Please do not ask a Welshman to read The Oxford Book of English Poetry . I despise Oxford . I despise the English . I despise their poetry . All I want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNNY Think ? What the devil do you mean ? FISHKIN ( Softly ) I mean  --  think ! JOHNNY What the devil with ? FISHKIN ( Swiftly ) My head ! JOHNNY ( Swiftly ) Oh , yes . ( Slight pause ) What do you think about ? FISHKIN I think  --  ( Slight pause , suddenly , swiftly ) I wo n't tell , that 's all . I do n't have to . Why should I tell you what I think ? p. 14 JOHNNY Because I 'm your friend . On my word of honor , I 'm your friend . FISHKIN ( Slowly ) Well , I think , Why am I alive ? Why is such a nothingness alive ? What is the sense of it ? Who am I to be alive ? Who am I to know the things I know ? Why do I breathe ? What is the meaning of this body I inhabit ? Why is my voice so ridiculous ? Why is my countenance so stupid ? What am I supposed to do to make a little sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm nothing ? Why am I proud and happy sometimes ? Oh , yes , I have laughed  --  laughed as if I were a lord . What is the meaning of such nonsense ? I 'm nothing ! Why am I alive ? JOHNNY Well , I 'm your friend , see ? SMITHER I 'll tell you why you 're alive , brother . You 're alive to suffer . JOHNNY How do you know ? SMITHER I know , that 's all , and I 'm your friend whether you like it or not . FISHKIN ( Standing and shouting to JIM SMITHER ) All right , so I 'm alive to suffer , so what good is it ? You 're his friend whether he likes it or not and he 's my friend whether I like it or not , and you love everybody , so what good is it ? All right , so I 'm alive to suffer , so I 'm suffering . p. 15 JOHNNY Well , stop suffering and read The Oxford Book of English Poetry . FISHKIN ( Almost chanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you read this book ? The Bible ? FISHKIN ( Nods ) A little . JOHNNY All right . Here . Read it . ( He hands FISHKIN the book . FISHKIN sits on the edge of the big chair and opens the book again ) FLORA Must n't stand around in the public library making confusion and asking questions . Please sit down and read . JOHNNY No , thanks . I do n't enjoy it any more . FLORA Then why do you come to the public library ? JOHNNY Oh , I do n't know . I guess I come to the public library because I came here every day many years ago . I came in search of  --  well , the Holy Grail , let 's say . FLORA Must n't look for the Holy Grail in the public library . JOHNNY Perhaps not , but it 's here if it 's anywhere at all , and I come here in the hope of witnessing the arrival of someone so pure in heart that it will be revealed to him . The weeping girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps it will be revealed to her . Or to the man in the cage there . Or to the soldier thrashing about . Or to the prisoner . It must be revealed to someone again . I come to the public library to see the Holy Grail revealed . p. 16 FLORA Must n't expect miracles in the public library . She returns to the divan and stretches out on it . JIM SMITHER goes back to whistling Careless Love . JOHNNY sits at the piano and looks at everybody . He suddenly plays the piano . While he is playing , JIM CROW , a young Negro , comes in through the swinging doors and takes the center of the stage . He is wearing an old red circus coat and a red cap with green braid . Slung around his neck is a battered bugle , which he lifts to his lips . He blows a long and solemn call on the bugle . ARIMATHEA ( Shouting at the top of his lungs , absolutely delighted ) So have I heard on Africa 's burning shoreThe noble lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welcome , noble lion ! What 's the meaning of the noble roar ? CROW ( As if he were announcing the entry of a king ) Make way for Jim Dandy ! ARIMATHEA Never heard of him . CROW ( Holding the swinging doors open ) Mr. Jim Dandy  --  hisself ! JIM DANDY comes in . He is an enormously fat man , pouting like a hurt child , and looking like a tramp with manners . When JIM CROW reaches the center of the stage he kneels . JIM DANDY touches him elegantly on the shoulder with his walking stick , recently cut from a tree , and JIM CROW rises to his feet . In his left hand JIM DANDY holds a cricket , a metal device which makes a sound when pressed : clickety-clack . He studies the scene , notices the chair in which FISHKIN is seated , and presses the device as if to say something absolutely final , if incomprehensible . JIM CROW leaps onto the platform and gently escorts FISHKIN up and out of the chair and off the platform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . FISHKIN is in a rage . p. 17 FISHKIN ( Whispering ) Get back into your mother ! Who are you to be so high and mighty ? JIM DANDY presses the cricket : clickety-clack . JIM CROW brings a white heart-shaped rock out of his coat pocket and places it at the center of the chair 's black cushion , which JIM DANDY hands to him . JIM CROW places the cushion with the heart-shaped rock on it on the platform . JIM DANDY waves his stick over and around about the rock in a meaningless-meaningful way , and then presses the cricket again . MOLLY steps out of the revolving door and in a twinkling of an eye bursts out of her black rags and is a beautiful girl in a ballet costume . This happens as if a flower had burst into bloom , or a butterfly escaped its cocoon . She dances a ballet while JIM CROW sings on . JOHNNY plays the piano . TOMMY SINGH comes out of his booth strumming on the stringed instrument.THE MAHARAJAH makes an appropriate rhythm on the tambourine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if something were being celebrated . GIBBON stares up into Jim Dandy 's face and back at the sheet of paper he holds , and says , Love . Love .

The runaway girl comes in through the swinging doors , kneels , and holds her arms out to the children of the cave . p. 18 DANDY ( Waving his cane ) Children , run to loving arms ! The children run to the runaway girl 's arms , then go to JIM DANDY and stand before him . The runaway girl stands over the heart-shaped rock . FISHKIN is dumbfounded , slapping his forehead with amazement and chagrin . JOCK is altogether taken by the beauty of MOLLY . They dance together , with the little girl of the cave dancing around them . JOHNNY leaves the piano , goes to FLORA and lifts her off the divan into his arms and dances with her , while the boy of the cave tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping the music and dancing ) Why do you dance ? They 're going to hang me in the morning ! For God 's sake , somebody tell them I 'm innocent ! JIM DANDY turns and looks up at the prisoner in an agony of pity and helplessness . The children of the cave become frightened and run to the cave and hide . TOMMY SINGH puts away the stringed instrument and takes up the rifle and begins thrashing about again . GIBBON moans pathetically . JIM CROW stands beside JIM DANDY as if to protect him . MOLLY notices herself and is filled with shame and tries to hide in the revolving door . The runaway girl sits on the couch and weeps bitterly . JIM CROW , followed helplessly by GIBBON and JOCK , moves toward the prisoner , as the curtain begins to come down very slowly .

JIM CROW is kneeling in front of JIM DANDY . JIM DANDY touches him wearily with his stick and JIM CROW gets to his feet and stands beside him . JIM CROW brings the heart-shaped rock out of his pocket , looks at it a moment , and then puts it back in his pocket . He turns and looks up at the window of the jail , which is now empty . A funeral wreath of leaves and straw , fur and feathers , is under the window , with a valentine inside of it . The children of the cave are out of sight . JOCK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the circus wagon with GIBBON . Now and then he closes the book slowly and throws his arms around GIBBON , who says , What 's the matter , Bob ? GIBBON wears enormous old shoes now . Some hair has fallen from his hands and forehead . MOLLY is back in her black rags .. She sits at the top of the disengaged stairway and tightens her stockings while FISHKIN stands by and watches . He looks from her leg to the broken pillar , and then back to her leg , which MOLLY holds out and up . TOMMY SINGH is in his little house smoking a cigarette . The runaway girl is lying on the couch . She moans and mumbles and turns and sprawls . JIM THE MAHARAJAH leans against his wagon rolling a cigarette . He has removed his turban and wears a straw hat . He has also removed his robe , revealing a bright plaid wool shirt and corduroy pants . His sign now reads : Jim the Oracle , Fortunes , 5 . He looks into the sky and speaks softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens and what do I see ? I see flat on his feet , far below and far away , yet nearer than the inside of outside , the perfect defective thing whose breed is man , whose name is Jim , whose time is now , whose hope is love , whose fortune is life , whose reward is death , whose purpose is replenishment , whose pleasure is to quench thirst and satisfy hunger , whose best scheme is to dream and forget . ( Pause ) I am that man , and I 'm rolling a cigarette . ( He licks the cigarette , lights it , inhales and exhales ) I am that perfect defective thing which ca n't remember and ca n't forget . An Indian of the Cherokee Tribe , I wore the turban of the Hindu mystic , called myself Maharajah , and sold secrets . Not long ago , to cure the schooling I was given at Indian Institute , I joined the circus , worked as roustabout and caretaker of apes . In the eyes of one of them I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . Gibbon , at my feet . I took his wagon-cage and made it home , traveling the plains until the wheels fell off , and settled here . ( He searches the sky ) I look into the heavens and see myself : Jim the honest fake . Jim the wide-awake . The cheerful cheat , cheering from both feet . Jim the schemer , the dying dreamer . The monkey mystic , Christian and cannibalistic . The noble knave , gentle and brave . Liar , swindler , confidence man , snake in the grass , give me a coin and I 'll say your fairest dreams shall come to pass . But why not ? I do it in the absence of better science . I do it in the interim , while we wait . ( Slight pause ) I had three secrets and sold them all , changed my business , and put in a new stock of merchandise . My secrets were precious , for they were well-known . The first was love , repeated three times . A real bargain , yet my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love is the best secret there is , and I did not cheat them . If they had known the secret , they had not known it was the secret I was selling , and therefore needed it . I 'm satisfied that I gave full value . The second secret was patience . I learned that secret from rocks and ruins . Another bargain , but again my customers complained , for who does not know the wisdom of patience ? Rocks and ruins revealed the second secret , but the rose taught me the third . A secret of three words , in many ways it was the biggest bargain of all , but still my customers complained . The rose said to me and I said to my customers who bought the secret : be , beget , begone . ( Slight pause ) That finished the secret business . Now , I sell fortunes and forecasts . Why not ? I enjoy the work . ( He steps into his wagon , shakes the tambourine , beats a drum ) Oyla , shoyla , boyla ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fortune told . Ooban , dooban , doo-loo-loo-loo , loo ! Fishkin , I can be of help to you . p. 21 FISHKIN Drop dead ! MAHARAJAH You  --  Jock ! Oyla , oyla , oyla ! Let me tell your fortune . ARIMATHEA I know my fortune , and if I needed comfort , I have n't the price to pay for it . MAHARAJAH I 'll tell your fortune free , as a demonstration of my skill . ARIMATHEA Well , all right , tell it . What do you know about me that I do n't know ? MAHARAJAH I know this , and this is all of it , so listen carefully : You  --  Jock  --  shall go to heaven when you die . ( He clangs the triangle in his wagon ) Oyla , shoyla , boyla ! Ooban , dooban , doo-loo-loo-loo , loo ! ARIMATHEA Is that all ? MAHARAJAH I give you heaven and you ask for more ? The demonstration is over . I 've tried my skill and found it true . FISHKIN Drop dead ! Your skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you to sell secrets and forecasts ? There are no secrets . We know more than we need to know . Sell us bread . Sell us wine . Sell us apples . Sell us flowers . Sell us figs and peaches and grapes . You ca n't save our lives with secrets . We know what 's ahead . What we need is wine and bread . Drop dead ! p. 22 MAHARAJAH Ooban , dooban , doo-loo-loo-loo , loo ! FISHKIN It 's the end of the world , and you say doo-loo-loo-loo , loo ! MAHARAJAH You are mistaken , my friend . It 's not the end , it 's the beginning . It 's the beginning every time you think of it . FISHKIN ( Waving him down and away with impatience ) Ahkhp ! All is silent for a moment . JIM DANDY turns to the vacant jail window , stares at it , inhaling and exhaling mournfully . JIM CROW runs and fetches him a paper cup full of water . JIM DANDY drinks the water and hands the paper cup back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JIM CROW studies Jim Dandy 's face , searches his pockets , and brings out a stick of chewing gum . CROW A stick of chewing gum , Mr. Jim Dandy , to help you while away the time ? JIM DANDY accepts the stick of chewing gum , thoughtfully unwraps it , and places it in his mouth , chewing enormously and glaring at FISHKIN who has been watching him with distaste . JIM CROW begins to shine Jim Dandy 's shoes . FISHKIN Ahkhp ! ( He goes off in disgust ) JIM DANDY presses the cricket : clickety-clack . JIM CROW stops shining his shoes and stands at attention before him . p. 23 DANDY The rock , Jim . The talisman . The heart . CROW Yes , sir . JIM CROW hands JIM DANDY the heart-shaped rock . JIM DANDY studies it , turning it over and over , and looking up at the vacant jail window . DANDY We failed , Jim ! Good things died as they were being born . CROW ( Solemnly , broken-hearted ) Yes , sir . DANDY And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail again . CROW ( Pointing to FISHKIN ) It 's him , Mr. Jim Dandy ! He 's the one who laughed at us . ( Helplessly JIM CROW moves toward FISHKIN . JIM DANDY presses the cricket : clickety-clack . JIM CROW halts ) DANDY No , Jim ! That 's not the way . ( He hands JIM CROW the heart-shaped stone . JIM CROW puts it back in his pocket ) Sit down and remember that when we fail , no one else is to blame , only ourselves , you and I. CROW ( Sits ) Yes , sir . An old man carrying mail arrives with several packages of books and several pieces of mail for the librarian . p. 24 POSTMAN Postage due is two cents , ma'am . ( FLORA works the cash register , and once again it goes through its ridiculous rigmarole of honking , groaning and shifting , all of which makes JIM DANDY pout . The POSTMAN looks around at everybody ) Letter for Mr. Jim Smither ! CROW ( Softly ) He ai n't here no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window ) He used to be up there , but they took him away . Everything was going good , the way it ought to go , and then there he was in jail , no worse than any of the rest of us , and only until morning to live , and all alone . ( He stands ) Everything fell to pieces . Everything just fell to little old crying pieces . Could you give me the letter for Mr. Jim Smither , please ? POSTMAN No . I believe it 's against postal regulations . CROW We was good friends . He told me the whole story , how they made a criminal out of him , born innocent . I stayed up all night keeping him company . I promised to remember him . Let me keep his letter , please . Is it from his mother ? POSTMAN No , I do n't believe it is. p. 25 CROW Well , whoever it 's from , please let me keep it . POSTMAN I believe the letter is supposed to go to the Dead Letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me keep the letter . I talked to him all night . What good is the letter in the Dead Letter Office ? Give the man 's letter to his friend . I 'll keep it for him till I die . I promised to remember him , Mr. Postman . Please give me the letter . POSTMAN Well , all right . ( He hands JIM CROW the letter . He looks into his bag and brings out a bundle of letters ) Bundle of letters for Mr. Jim Dandy . Clickety-clack . The POSTMAN hands JIM DANDY the bundle of letters and goes . JIM DANDY hands the letters to JIM CROW . Clickety-clack . JIM CROW opens a letter , studies it a moment , and reads . CROW Letter from Juliet . ( JIM DANDY leans forward eagerly , hopefully ) She say , My dear husband , my life , my love , my darling , if you could only know how I need money  --  ( Clickety-clack . JIM DANDY makes a face of pain and shame and agony . JIM CROW opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cruelty to Animals . The Society say , In order to protect our fellow animals of city , field and farm from the inhuman treatment they are getting , we must have more and more money  --  ( Clickety-clack ) Another letter from Juliet . She say , Sweet sweet husband , heart of my heart , if I could only tell you how very much I need  --  ( Clickety-clack . JIM DANDY looks into Jim Crow 's eyes . JIM CROW nods , indicating that once again Juliet beseeches him not for love but for money . JIM DANDY sighs with anguish . Clickety-clack . JIM CROW opens another letter ) Letter from the Peace on Earth , Goodwill Among Men League , Incorporated . The League say , In order to protect our fellow man in city , village , factory , mine , field and farm , we appeal to you , before it is too late , to send us a little money to  --  ( Clickety-clack . JIM CROW finishes the sentence slowly and softly )  --  carry on the good work and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letter from the Citizens ' Committee on Control of Atomic Energy , Incorporated Under the Laws of the State of Delaware .

They say , Now , now , now or never . We must have more  --  ( Clickety-clack ) Letter from  --  ( Clickety-clack . JIM CROW begins to open another letter , but JIM DANDY gives him the clickety-clack and he puts the letter on the bottom of the bundle and looks at the last letter ) That 's all , Mr. Jim Dandy . This here letter is for Mr. Jim Smither . ( Clickety-clack . JIM CROW opens the letter and looks at it ) It 's from Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot. p. 26 DANDY I beg your pardon ? CROW Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot is what it says right here on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( JIM CROW gives the bugle an exceptionally dynamic work-out , especially invented for the occasion . GIBBON and FISHKIN and JOCK and TOMMY SINGH gather around JIM CROW . The runaway girl sits up . JOHNNY and FLORA and THE MAHARAJAH watch and listen ) What does the man say ? CROW ( Reading ) He say , Win your Christmas money now . DANDY ( Very slowly and clearly , as if to make sure of the words ) Win your Christmas money now ? CROW Yes , sir . Win your Christmas money now , that 's what it says right here . Win  --  money ! Win  --  money ! That 's what everybody needs  --  money ! Christmas money or Easter money or Thanksgiving money or Fourth of July money or Lincoln 's Birthday money or confederate money or counterfeit money . Any kind of money . Everybody got to win some , or find some , or inherit some , or make some on a machine . I know we ai n't got no more . I gave the man in the wagon our last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my friend away and hanged him . I did it because I thought the secret would tell us why they did that . Everything was going good , and then everything fell to little old crying pieces , and I bought the secret because I thought it would tell us why it happened that way , but all the secret said was patience . What kind of a secret is patience ? What good is patience to the man they hanged ? What he needed was money . By the time the letter came telling him how to get money , it was too late . The letter came too late for the poor man . We need money too . Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot , he do n't come asking for money like the man in the wagon , and the Society , and the League , and the Committee , and the Mothers , and Juliet  --  he say WIN it ! ( Clickety-clack ) p. 27 DANDY Read on , please . CROW Yes , sir . The Ex-Jockey say next , Why should you go without ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's different , that 's better ! He say , With  --  with ! Not without  --  with ! He do n't say patience , and take a man 's last nickel . ( Clickety-clack ) He say , Every day Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot 's selections bring money to the needy . ( Swiftly ) Every day money to the needy ! He say , Stop guessing ! He say , No man , nor no woman , nor no child in his right mind has got to suffer neither hunger , or cold , or pain , or embarrassment , or disease , or homelessness in this beautiful world ! No man , he say . No man  --  no man ! He say that ! ( Excited ) No man ! DANDY ( Simultaneously amazed , delighted and irritated by the letter , and moved by Jim Crow 's impassioned reading of it ) Let me behold the letter , please . CROW ( Hands him the letter ) Yes , sir ! He say , Go with  --  with ! He say , No man got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading the rest of the letter , at first softly and then with excitement , his voice mounting until he is shouting ) You can mingle with the rich . You can . Poor man , beggar man , thief  --  I do n't care who you are , where you are , what people think of you , or what your luck has been so far . Somewhere among every man 's ancestors is a prince or a lord , a priest or a saint , and do n't ever forget it . Stop dreaming ! Wake up ! Inherit the wealth of your ancestors ! Let Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot restore you to your proper place in the sun : healthy , wealthy and wise . Stop living like a mouse , live like the rich people do . Have yourself money all the time  --  money galore  --  money to burn  --  money to give to the poor . Get rid of your coughs and colds and aches and pains . Get rid of your fears . Escape from your nightmares . Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot has helped others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well-dressed , be confident , eat the best food in the best restaurants , buy the best seats at the best movies and plays  --  they 're entertaining , they 're educational , they 're good for you . Go to the ballet and watch them dance . Go to the opera and listen to them sing and holler . Get a kick out of this life for a change . Be somebody worthwhile for a change . Radiate positive vibrations wherever you go . Give the kind of tips that make people remember you . Make peo- ple say when they see you , Here comes Lucky Hogan , or Lucky Harrigan , or whatever your name is . ( JIM DANDY stands ) Meet pretty women in nice places and act non-chalant . There 's a pretty woman for every lucky man in the world . Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot says every man in the world is a lucky man if he only knew it , so why waste time ? You live only once and you 're entitled to your share of everything , so be a winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will send full particulars . Do n't wait ! Opportunity knocks but once . Yours with a smile , Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot . P.S. Do n't be pushed around all your life . Win your Christmas money now ! p. 28 FISHKIN It would n't help ! This remark is like a thunderbolt to JIM DANDY , who mumbles to himself with moist , slobbering lips , trying to control himself . DANDY ( Aside ) What unholy science and mischief is in this man to mock the hopes of all who live . This unbeliever whose enemy is miracle , who in the very seed blights beauty and befouls the blessed accident of grace . This accurate cynic who 's learned from his own juiceless chemistry a death-dealing truth which he will not have for himself alone but must spread abroad in all the world like a vile and contagious disease of the soul . I knew the truth he knows when my weight was sixty pounds and the number of my years sixteen . ( He turns to FISHKIN , speaking gently , trying to control his anger ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say  --  there is surely that in it  --  and earnestness of a sort , perhaps even love  --  still , I fancy you may be mistaken , for there is more to science than the facts and charts and measures and figures show . Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot has lived among the horses ; has known them well ; has ridden them in many important races ; there is science in him , too . FISHKIN ( Stubbornly ) Makes no difference ! It would n't help ! p. 29 DANDY ( Sitting in his chair ) May I ask why ? FISHKIN It would n't help because even if Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot named a horse as the winner of the next race , the horse would not win ! DANDY Would any horse win ? FISHKIN Yes , one horse would win , but not Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot 's horse . DANDY How do you know ? FISHKIN How do I know ? Drop dead , that 's how I know ! I bet the horses in Swansea as a boy ! I bet them in Liverpool as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bet them in New York and Chicago and Florida and Maryland and California and Mexico . Do you think this is what I have become for nothing ? Listen . I 'll tell you why it would n't help . For argument 's sake , let 's say the little man  --  Ex-Jockey Earl Catfoot  --  knows all the horses that run at all the tracks in all the races . Let 's say he really knows the horses  --  not just to pass through the stables and smell , but to meet as friends . So Mr. Catfoot goes to the horses and talks to them , and they talk to him . He says , Asia Joe , what do you know ? Bulldog Roy , how 's the boy ? Sammy 's Bird , what 's the good word ? Original Sin , are you going to win ? And so on and so forth , down the line . Well , do you think any one of the horses could tell him the truth ? Do you think any one of the horses could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Emphatically ) No ! Because not one of the horses knows . Before any race , nobody knows who 's going to win . After the race , everybody knows who won , but then it 's too late . ( Pause ) Drop dead . It would n't help ! p. 30 DANDY Stop , man ! ( Almost whispering ) For the love of God , stop ! Your science is true , but I loathe it . ( Suddenly shouting ) You blight me , sir ! ( Gently , softly ) You are right , you are right , but men live by miracle and your science permits them no life . The man was hanged ! Hanged for want . Do you think we were not hanged with him ? Is our guilt less than his , whatever his fault may have been ? He wanted miracle , as I want it , and was hanged . Please be good enough to leave me now , for I am undone and must see to my restoration . FISHKIN finds everyone against him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely . He stops beside JOHNNY at the piano . JOHNNY ( Softly ) I 'm your friend , see ? I 'm the best friend you 've got . Now , get away from me ! FISHKIN ( Almost to himself ) I do n't want any friends . ( He wanders off to MOLLY and looks up into her face , but she ignores him , so he goes to GIBBON ) Hello . GIBBON I hate you ! FISHKIN All right , hate me ! ( He turns to JOCK , hoping to find a friend ) What are you reading ? p. 31 ARIMATHEA ( In a rage ) The great scientist wants to know what I 'm reading ! I 'm reading this book ! ( He slams the book to the floor ) FISHKIN I only wanted to know the name of the book . ARIMATHEA ( Picks up the book ) What 's the difference what the name of the book is ? It 's full of the same old words and the same old lies . Do n't read , Gibbon ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to read . I 've got to find out about people . ( Pointing at JIM DANDY and FISHKIN and JIM CROW and THE MAHARAJAH ) I 've got to find out about him , and him , and him , and him . I 've got to find out about all the different kinds of people . ARIMATHEA You do n't have to find out about people at all . GIBBON Yes , I do . ARIMATHEA Well , you 'll never find out about them from books , I 'll tell you that . GIBBON ( To FISHKIN ) Ink pink you stink ! FISHKIN All right , I stink ! ARIMATHEA ( At the counter , to FLORA ) Give me another book , please . This book is supposed to be about roses , but it 's about the man who wrote the book , and he 's no rose . He 's a cabbage . p. 32 FLORA Must n't be bitter in the public library . ( In a hushed , dramatic , batty way ) Where there is love , there is beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where there is truth , there is mercy . Where there is mercy , there is hope . Where there is hope , there is life everlasting and indestructible  --  new time , new weather , new sunshine , new rain , new grass , new flowers , new leaves , new blossoms , new fruit . Must n't be bitter where there is love . ( As she speaks THE MAHARAJAH gets out of his wagon and moves to her and looks into her face ) ARIMATHEA What love ? I do n't see any love . FLORA Must n't be blind in the public library . MAHARAJAH ( Leaping back , pointing at FLORA , almost barking ) Ah-ha ! I saw you ! I saw the love of which you speak , lady ! I saw you ! ( To the others ) I saw this woman holding an infant to her breast . It was a wonderful thing to see , for the infant was a noble man , and the infant winked at me . ( Almost to himself ) Who  --  is  --  the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us make room for him . The infant 's on his way , for I saw him at her breast . He was not one man , but a multitude . He was all men rolled into one . Let us , who are not his father , draw away , so that the infant may not be too long delayed . p. 33 FISHKIN It would n't help ! MAHARAJAH Away , away ! I saw him wink , I tell you ! He draws away , taking JOCK and FISHKIN with him . THE MAHARAJAH discovers JOHNNY , who is now staring at FLORA . THE MAHARAJAH looks from FISHKIN to JOCK and nods knowingly . GIBBON and TOMMY SINGH come into the group and stand with THE MAHARAJAH and FISHKIN and JOCK . SINGH I say , what 's the bloody hush for ? MAHARAJAH Birth . FISHKIN Drop dead , birth would n't help ! MAHARAJAH ( Claps a hand over Fishkin 's mouth ) Shhhh ! FISHKIN Ahkhp ! DANDY ( Clickety-clack . JIM CROW looks at him eagerly . JIM DANDY is in terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . JIM CROW hands JIM DANDY the two letters from his wife , and JIM DANDY takes them with trembling hands and unfolds them and reads them silently , as his face trembles with anguish and tears come to his eyes . JIM CROW wants to comfort him . He brings a cigar out of a pocket . p. 34 CROW Cigar , Mr. Jim Dandy ? ( JIM DANDY takes the cigar , bites off the end and spits it out , and JIM CROW strikes a kitchen match and lights the cigar . JIM DANDY inhales and exhales and continues to read the letters from his wife , but in spite of the comfort of the cigar he is still in agony ) Music , Mr. Jim Dandy ? JIM DANDY does not answer , so JIM CROW goes to the piano and takes the chair just vacated by JOHNNY , who is moving toward FLORA . JIM CROW begins to play the piano very softly . The light dims , as if the sun had gone behind a cloud . FLORA moves toward JOHNNY . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not look directly at one another . DANDY ( Whispering ) Juliet , my wife , my wife ! JOHNNY ( To himself , above Jim Crow 's music ) Is this what became of us ? Where are the pals I was to bring together into the best nation yet ? Where are the girls who were to be the best religion ? ( MOLLY , in her black rags , dances ) The girls who woke up in the morning like flowers ; who were sculptured swift and white , and put laughter into the dirty streets ? Where are the girls who danced in and out of the great ideas and turned them into common folklore ? Who understood cause and effect , supply and demand , wealth and poverty , society and nature , health and disease , dream and reality , science and sorcery ? What happened to the girls ? Where are they now , who were beyond pride or shame , and did n't need the help of beauty parlor , patent medicine , equal rights , or psychiatry ? Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the junkyard world and having all the fun I thought was going to come to something better than this  --  youth in ruins ; science and crime in partnership ; the management of the affairs of men left to imbeciles , impostors , knaves and maniacs ; mankind a sickly suicide writing his foolish farewell note ; and the poet standing around with his mouth open . ( Suddenly , with passion , whispering ) Oh , frig the frigging rock that frigged me under the snow ! I thought I knew , I thought I knew , but now I know I do n't . ( Softly , after a pause ) Where 's the running girl who ran like the loveliest animal in the animal world to the boy who knew what he was going to do ? Where is she now ? And where 's he ? Where is the poet , immaculate in the gutter , and his pals , working their way with him to the best nation yet , kidding the pants off pride and pomposity . The pals who sent letters to men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the very Emperor : " Jim , you 'll drag yourself to the grave if you do n't behave . Traffic no more in the humble slave , for he is more Emperor than you , and better born . " To the very Queen : " Peg , are you sold to the Pretender ? Will you never wrestle with a working man ? I hang out in the back room at The Broken Bell . Come there incognito as yourself and raise a little wholesome hell . I wear a face , and a dog 's hide . Come for the healing and the buggy ride . " To the very Beggar : " Hodge , I ask alms of you . Turn out of your vaults the wicked hoarding of my precious gifts . I gave you honest scorn , now give it back , for I gave it when I was young , and it gave you greatness . Write my name in your will , it 's only fair .

I saw you slip the sword into the enemy heart , but I only laughed and told no one . It was you who blabbed and bragged yourself into fame and shame and the metal hat . Was it worth it , man ? What fun , what glory 's in a throne like that ? " ( Pause , laughing to himself ) Where is the poet , filthy in the fiction room , winking at the printed page , or in the corridor bowing to William Blake flapping down the hall to the reference room ? Filthy and free ! Where is he now ? ( He looks about ) So this is the common man home from the war , his pals dead or mad , the best nation lost , the girls dying beyond bedroom doors , or runaway from home , or batty in the public library . So this is kingdom come . So this is us . So these are the angels who walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , we gave it a go ! We moved that way a dozen years or so . ( With intensity and regret ) We almost made it  --  almost , almost  --  and then the party voted . ( Laughter in his speech ) I frig the frigging friendship they voted for me , who never wanted friendship so inept and false . Whose friendship 's for sale today , and what 's the price ? Five cents ? Mine , I 'll give away . Now , I want nothing else  --  only a quiet evening in the ruins , for I 'll never make it any more . During this talk FLORA coos like a dove every now and then , and occasionally lifts an arm as if to reach out to him . The children of the cave come out and move toward FLORA , while THE MAHARAJAH and the others watch . When JOHNNY stops talking , MOLLY stops dancing . JIM CROW stops playing the piano . FLORA speaks to JOHNNY , but does not look at him . She speaks with effort , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of cooing , humming , and moaning . p. 35 FLORA I want to tell you something , but I do n't seem to have the knack of talking out loud any more , except to say what is not permitted in the public library . And I do n't seem to remember anything else at all , except  --  ( Suddenly , eagerly ) Are you the man I once met on a train ? He got drunk . His name was Jim . I know I should have married him . In college he was a football player , but when I met him he was working for an insurance company . That 's why he got drunk . He said there is no insurance . Are you the man who said there is no insurance ? ( Slight pause ) He said there is no guarantee . He said there is no defense . He said there is no protection . He said there is no security and no safety . He got very drunk and said there is no ownership , public or private , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was crying . He said there is no friendship . He said a man 's best friend is himself , and that 's no friend at all . He said there is no communication . He wore good clothes and was n't noisy or a nuisance . He spoke only to me , and when he laughed he laughed softly . ( Slight pause , almost whispering ) He said there is no love , but when he said it he kissed me . ( Pause , turning to look at him for the first time , and then turning away ) Are you the man who kissed me ? JOHNNY I 'm afraid not , but I have been on a train . p. 36 FLORA He was very young . It was many years ago . Perhaps you 've forgotten . Do you remember having said to someone like me on a train when you were very drunk there is no love , as if to say why is there no love ? JOHNNY No , I do n't believe I was on that train . FLORA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a slight pause ) I met a newspaperman on a ship once , too . JOHNNY I know . They will find you on trains and buses , ships and airplanes , in revolving doors and elevators , on merry-go-rounds and escalators , in the next seat at the movie . They will find you as they go . FLORA He wrote a book . JOHNNY It was the least he could do . FLORA He was killed in London . JOHNNY I know , I know . FLORA It may have been suicide . He jumped or fell out of a hotel window . I read the story of his life on the obituary page of The New York Times . They did n't tell the truth about him , which makes me wonder if anybody ever knows the truth about anybody . They said he had searched for the truth all his life . He told me he knew the truth and was looking for something better . He died in London in 1939 . He was born in Tennessee in 1903 . ( She tries to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said what I wanted to say , although I thought I wanted to say something else .

( With almost pathetic brightness ) I 've had this job a good many years now , you know  --  day after day , year in and year out , except for a trip during my vacation every summer . So of course it is n't that I do n't know better . I know very well it is n't proper for the librarian to speak this way in the public library , but I suppose I had always believed the work would be temporary . When I first came here I do believe I was a good deal more efficient , but I find lately that I do things automatically  --  keep the rules , I mean  --  because I 'm so busy wondering about myself  --  what I 'm doing , you know , and what I 'll be doing next year , and whether or not someone will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 've gone to a great deal of trouble about my personal appearance these past few years . I 've always loved books , and of course books must be read , and read again , some of them , but I sometimes wonder if it is n't possible that books are n't everything . They do frequently seem awfully dead things , I must confess , and in the early summer every year they fill me with absolute sickness and loathing . I shudder to think what we 'd do without them , of course , but  --  Someone perhaps who would not feel that every rule of the public library must be kept . ( Pause ) Well , I 've talked enough for this year . ( Trying to smile ) You 've been most kind , and I know I shall not soon forget your kindness . ( She turns to go ) p. 37 JOHNNY Wait ! ( FLORA stops but does not turn to him ) Please do n't stop . FLORA ( Shyly , a little desperately ) I 'm afraid I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She almost faces him again ) JOHNNY Say anything . Have you bought a hat lately ? FLORA I bought shoes yesterday . JOHNNY Speak of that . What kind of shoes were they ? FLORA These that I 'm wearing . JOHNNY They 're very pretty , I must say . FLORA Thank you . JOHNNY Tell me about the man who fitted them to your feet . FLORA Well , he was old and little and had a cough that made his face turn moist and red . JOHNNY Had he children ? FLORA ( Almost laughing ) Oh , I do n't know . He did n't say , but he tried very hard to find something to suit me , and he had no pleasant remarks to make . He was rather ill , I believe . He seemed overworked and tired , but he was very patient . I felt as guilty as could be making him work so hard , but I did have my heart set on new shoes . ( She stops , embarrassed at what she 's saying and the silly fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , please . You must n't stop . FLORA Really ? JOHNNY Of course you must n't . FLORA Well , once I bought shoes from a young man who was fond of movies . JOHNNY What did he say ? FLORA He asked if I thought he looked like Rudolph Valentino , and I said he did although he did n't at all , and then he asked if I was an actress . JOHNNY What did you tell him ? FLORA ( Laughter in her voice ) I told him I was . ( A little ashamed ) I 'm not at all of course , but since he brought the matter up , I told him I was . ( Suddenly , pathetically ) Perhaps I am , but if I am , I 'm a poor one , for I ca n't for the life of me say what I really want to say  --  what I 've been trying so hard to say all this time . JOHNNY ( Gently ) Please say what you want to say . You can , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . FLORA Well , I 'll try again , but if what I say is silly to you please do n't laugh at me . I could n't bear it . I 'm so fearful of being laughed at . Perhaps it 's because I do appear so ridiculous . It would n't do at all for you to laugh at me , too , for I know I 'm not really ridiculous . ( Pause , with great effort ) It is n't your name I want to say . I do n't know your name , but even if I knew it , it would n't be that , although saying your name might help me to say what it is I really want to say . Believe I knew your name and who you are and had said your name and then  --  ( She stops and starts again desperately ) Well , if the words that have been said so many times before by so many others  --  if they are still the only words that can try to say again all the things that words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . ( Softly , almost with embarrassment ) I love you . ( The boy of the cave stands behind JOHNNY , the girl behind FLORA ) p. 39 JOHNNY ( Taking her by the shoulders ) I love you . They are n't easy words to say . They 're rather silly , mocking , little words , but what they try to mean is always wonderful and strange , and you 've said them and meant them , and they are the words that try to say what I mean . They can be said , I suppose , a hundred thousand different ways by the same man to the same woman and still mean something more , or something better , than each of them may ever know . I love you . I love you . Whoever you are , and whatever I mean by it , and whatever you understand by it , I love you . See ? But the words are no use . Here . ( He embraces her gently , kissing her forehead ) Now , what I mean has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must say in words , too . The best shall always be said without them , but the best must wait its proper turn . Before I say a better thing without words , I must tell you that by nature I am alone , as you are . Still , let us put together our aloneness . I will seek and encourage every possible comfort and delight , and I will hold back death on every side . I will speak gently and with solemn faith . I will put together the violence of truth and the healing of humor as our home . I will confound time and change with love and patience . I will believe . Together we shall be , we shall beget , and begone . ( He kisses FLORA violently , and she returns the kiss with all the helplessness of her whole life and body . The kiss is not unlike the struggling of animals standing on their hind legs . At last the kiss ends . He holds her at arm 's length , looks at her a moment tenderly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know now better than ever how alone you are . I look away because I want this said with no hurt to you . Neither art nor science nor religion nor poetry supports our faith in this action , this longing for continuity and meaning . The truth about us is fierce and heartless , dry and destructive , but despite it all I say you are out of every man 's understanding but mine . And I ask you to rest within yourself , so that I may rest there too , and resting make a place for you to rest in me . Seek no longer , as I no longer seek . Here is our own poor grail . You shall find no more , and I shall find no more . We are found , we are nothing , but I adore you . ( He smacks her on the behind , which makes her laugh with relief ) Come along with me and be my wife ! You are the girl I 've looked for all my life ! They go off quickly , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously and blows his nose as the curtain comes down. @x It could now be another century and another world , but it is still the same century and the same world , although things have changed and moved again . Gibbon 's tree is covered with leaves now , and the grass beneath the tree is green . It is early morning , before daybreak . JIM DANDY is asleep in his chair . His lips are parted and moist , and he is making noises with his breathing  --  enormous noises , as if he were mankind itself asleep . He mumbles in a mixture of languages . He sighs , groans , sobs , hums , sings , whistles , trembles , stiffens , and so on and so forth . DANDY ( In his sleep ) Alif , ba , ta . ( Moan ) Ha , waw , ya . ( Opening and closing of mouth , making a pilop-pilop sound ) Daleth , he , vau . ( Hum ) Eta , theta , iota . ( Singing sigh ) Sin , shin , chad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nun .

( Singing talk ) Row row , row row row . **26;2409;TOOLONG . Rig-jig-jig . Tra la , la la , la la . ( Hum and moan ) Oghlan ! Kef ! ( He whistles softly the first part of Careless Love , then stops , and JIM CROW whistles the rest of the song , while JIM DANDY seems to listen in his sleep , calming down a little ) TOMMY SINGH measures his area as if he were dreaming the act he performs . JACK ADAMS , an old man with a long white beard , occupies the jail now . Like JIM SMITHER , the young prisoner , he stands clutching the bars of the cell window . The runaway girl lies on Flora 's couch , fast asleep . She sobs softly in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus wagon , is older now , and an open book lies before him , as he sleeps . He wears reading glasses . There is little hair on his hands now , his forehead is high , his face clean-shaven . JIM THE MAHARAJAH , THE ORACLE , is in his wagon , asleep . The sign on his wagon now reads : Indian Chief Jim , Ice Cream , 5 . Alone now at the edge of the cave under the jail , standing in desolate loneliness , looking out , is the little girl . TOMMY SINGH puts up his rifle and sits on the bench in his little house , singing a native song as he strums the stringed instrument . He sings : Tai rani , mai rani , khon bharai pani . Anak fadak . Thunug munug dhari ghutku bhanjari . Digi digi digi digi . Lahar lahar . JOHNNY , still pretty much the same , comes in through the swinging doors , accompanied by LITTLE JOHNNY , the boy of the cave , now of the world , six or seven years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , move alike , and talk alike . JOHNNY stands near the center of things , looking around . LITTLE JOHNNY goes quietly to the cave , drawn to the girl there . He stands staring at her , and she at him , and then suddenly the girl turns and hides in the cave . LITTLE JOHNNY goes to GIBBON and flops down beside him and looks into Gibbon 's open book . JOHNNY strolls over to JIM CROW . He listens a moment to JIM DANDY mumbling and moaning in his sleep , then looks at JIM CROW . p. 42 CROW ( Softly ) He 's asleep  --  Jim Dandy . JOHNNY Why do n't you sleep ? It 's night enough . CROW Got to stand watch . Got to look after Jim Dandy . Do n't sleep when he sleep . Just stand watch . ( Pause ) I could smoke me a cigarette , though . You would n't have a little old cigarette , would you ? Any little old broken piece of cigarette . My whole spirit crying for smoke . JOHNNY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hands shaking as he takes a cigarette out of the pack ) Oh , I would n't take a whole pack , thanks . Just one . ( He hands the pack back and smiles at the cigarette desperately ) Just the one I need so bad . ( JOHNNY lights the cigarette for him with a match from a book of matches . JIM CROW inhales deeply , then exhales ) Man , that 's more like it , that 's fine now , that 's living for a minute . Got to live sometime in my life . Cigarette bring me living . Seem like cigarette take me out of my old black hide , carry me away from aches and pains . You know , man , seem like cigarette give me memories ? JOHNNY Is that so ? CROW Yeah , man , right now I remember friends ! I remember the best friends a man ever had . We was all kinds  --  all kinds  --  hanging around being friends . Working together and not being ashamed of each other , and not afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black , and brown , and red , and yellow . We was from all over the world working and eating and talking and singing and dancing and living and learning together . Man , that 's crazy . What right I got have a memory like that ? Cigarette give me crazy memories . What right I got remember friends ? p. 43 DANDY Alif , ba , ta . Qaf , kaf , lam . Oghlan , arev , arev ! ( Moaning and crying ) Juliet , Juliet , Juliet ! JOHNNY What 's the matter with him ? CROW He 's tired . He 's big and tired , all swollen from loneliness . Fat man 's wife cheat on him , ask him for money all the time . He got no friend in the whole world  --  except me . Fat man got no friend . He got no name , even . White trash give me the name Jim Crow , I give fat man the name Jim Dandy . ( Pause ) He got the manners of a great man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's generous ? CROW He 's generous all right . He 's just about the most generous man I ever see , but it 's more like he 's always wanting things , the same as a millionaire . All kinds of things . God knows the things he wants I never hear about . He tell me one time to find him a talisman . Man , I do n't even know what a talisman is . ( He brings the white heart-shaped stone out of his pocket ) Well , it 's this here rock . We was in a place by the sea and he say to me , Let us walk beside the sea and find a talisman . So we walk beside the sea and he tell me to look for a rock shaped like a star , and I look and look and I find a rock shaped like the head of a little girl , and I find a rock shaped like a pear , and I find a rock shaped like a flower , but no rock like a star . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a heart , white as snow in the waters of the sea , and I pick it up and show it to him and he say , Jim , you have found our talisman  --  no evil shall befall us . He dry the rock with his handkerchief and he say , You are the guardian of the talisman  --  guard it well . He wave his stick over my head and say , Alif , ba , ta  --  ha , waw , ya  --  and away we go back to town with the talisman in my pocket . ( Pause . The runaway girl weeps in her sleep ) Little while ago he wake up and ask for wine . I give him water from the jar over there , like I always do . He drink the water all right . He do n't say that 's not wine . He drink the water and go back to sleep . I 'd fetch him wine if I could find some , but where I going to find wine ? No vineyard here . No grapes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could find some . Seem like I ca n't find nothing . I steal for him , too . One time I steal him fresh bread from bakery wagon . I steal him three apples one time from a tree . He talk and talk about that  --  all about apples , all about trees . He say , oh I do n't know how many different kinds of things about apples and trees . He bless the bread I steal and break it and give me some and we sit down on a big rock by the side of the road and chew and chew and he talk and talk with his mouth full , and I just do n't know what he saying , but he saying something . Something big and good too , from the size of the words and the sound of his voice . He talk like a preacher sometime , and when I steal something he like he bless me . He blessing and waving his stick and looking at the talisman all the time . I catch him a chicken one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tell me about eggs . All about eggs . Eggs this and eggs that . He say everything come from the egg  --  everything ! He say everything is one big egg , everything we see and everything we do n't see . We was hungry , but he say we got to wait for the chicken to give us an egg , so we can look at it . He say seeing the egg satisfy our hunger , so we sit down and wait for the egg . We wait three days , but the chicken give us no egg , so then he was sad , and he bless the chicken for me to cut and clean and cook , and we eat the chicken . He tell me I do n't steal ! One time I steal him chocolate cake from bakery wagon , all stale and dry , and we walk along the streets and eat it . That time he was very hungry . When we got no more chocolate cake , he sit down and cry like a baby . Man , he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel along with him and shine his shoes  --  all wore out , big holes on the bottom . ( LITTLE JOHNNY stands beside JOHNNY ) p. 44 JOHNNY Well , what about you ? What 's he do for you ? CROW He give me importance . He give me work to do . Something to occupy my time . Man , I got time . Seem like I got more time than anybody in the whole world . One time we was by a circus and I steal him this old coat and hat and he wear them all winter , but in the summertime he take them off and give them to me . He need warm clothes in the winter . Fat man get to coughing in the winter , seem like he do n't stop till summertime . He give me something to occupy my time . Blow the bugle , run before him wherever he go , clear the way , announce the arrival , stand watch , protect him from thieves and killers . Where would I be right now , except for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where ! ( Pause ) I come from Texas . Texas is where I originated all right , but Texas not my home . My old black hide  --  that 's my home . I guess I be back in Texas now  --  some place , because that 's where he found me . He come pushing and puffing down the summer road in his bare feet , with the hounds barking and chasing around , snapping at his heels , and he jump up and down in the hot dirt and holler out to me  --  Hey , there , boy ! Call off these mad dogs ! Fetch me a pair of shoes ! Do n't you know who I am ? And right then and there I knew  --  Mr. Jim Dandy ! Yes , sir , I tell him . Yes , sir ! I turn and run from the field where I fooling with cotton , and I fetch him a pair of shoes . Almost brand-new tennis shoes that I only wore on two Sundays . I put the shoes on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to set you free . ( Pause ) I guess I be there now , except for him . I guess maybe I 'd get to San Antonio some day , but maybe I would n't , too . With Mr. Jim Dandy I been all over this country . Every big city and hundreds of little ones . p. 45 JOHNNY ( Making small talk ) Been to Boston ? CROW No , not Boston , but every other big city . JOHNNY Philadelphia ? CROW Where 's that ? JOHNNY Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The City of Brotherly Love . CROW No , I do n't believe we ever been in that place . JOHNNY Washington , D. C. ? CROW What 's that ? JOHNNY District of Columbia , Capital of the Nation . CROW What they do there ? JOHNNY The government 's there . The White House and the President and the Senate and the House of Representatives . CROW Man , that must be far away . JOHNNY No farther than any other place . CROW I do n't believe we ever get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Senators do ? JOHNNY Filibuster , and try to get re-elected , and go home , and die , I guess . Ever been to Chicago ? p. 46 CROW No , I do n't think we ever walk into that place . Is that where they got them buildings in the street ? JOHNNY Yes , they 've got some buildings there . CROW With the police man on the corner ? JOHNNY Oh , yes . CROW And the hungry cats walking in the sunshine down by the garbage cans in the alley ? And the big fat flies buzzing around ? JOHNNY I suppose so . CROW We been there , or some place like it . JOHNNY How about New York ? CROW Maybe we been to New York , too . ( Half-asleep ) I guess we been everywhere , one time or another , but the best place of all was that place by the sea where I found the talisman . That was a big place , and the sea make me feel free . JOHNNY You 're tired . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand watch . JOHNNY I 'll stand watch for you . Go ahead . Lie down . It 's all right . CROW I could sleep me a little sleep all right . ( He sits down , his body obviously aching for rest ) Oh , man ! Poor old weary bones . Poor old weary black hide . You sure you do n't mind standing watch over Jim Dandy ? p. 47 JOHNNY I do n't mind at all . You just stretch out and go to sleep . CROW All right . I sleep me a little sleep . ( He stretches out on the platform behind Jim Dandy 's chair and is soon asleep . LITTLE JOHNNY gets on the platform and examines JIM DANDY very carefully ) LITTLE JOHNNY Who is this man ? JOHNNY Jim Dandy . LITTLE JOHNNY Why is he fat ? JOHNNY I do n't know . He has n't got any money . LITTLE JOHNNY Do you have to have money to be fat ? JOHNNY Well , maybe not . LITTLE JOHNNY Well , why is he fat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know everything , but that 's not true , although at one time , many years ago , I believed I knew everything . I 'm still eager to learn of course , so why do n't you tell me why he 's fat ? LITTLE JOHNNY Is it because he 's hungry ? JOHNNY Perhaps . LITTLE JOHNNY Is it because he does n't like anybody ? Maybe at first he was skinny and liked everybody , and then somebody came along that he wanted to like very much but just could n't like and he got a little fat . Then a lot of people came along that he just could n't like , and he got fatter and fatter until he got as fat as he is now . p. 48 JOHNNY I must say I think you 're a good deal nearer the truth than I could ever hope to be . LITTLE JOHNNY Is he fat because he 's hiding ? ( He steps down ) JOHNNY Yes , I think that may be so . How is it you are n't tired when everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I like to get up when you get up . I like to be awake when everybody else is asleep . Are you tired ? JOHNNY Well , as a matter of fact , I am , a little . LITTLE JOHNNY Well , I guess I am , too , a little . JOHNNY ( Moving to the counter ) Well , then , what do you say we sit down ? JOHNNY lifts LITTLE JOHNNY onto the counter , then sits beside him . They are silent a moment , just sitting and listening to the silence all around . TOMMY SINGH is asleep on his bench now . The old man in jail has left the window . They listen to the sleepers breathing . LITTLE JOHNNY Why are we sitting ? JOHNNY Why not ? LITTLE JOHNNY Oh . ( Slight pause ) Do you like me ? p. 49 JOHNNY Yes , I do . LITTLE JOHNNY Do you like you ? JOHNNY Yes , but I like you more . JOHNNY begins to whistle Careless Love . After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heard singing the song as if from far away , while JOHNNY goes on whistling . When the song ends , LITTLE JOHNNY tries to whistle . LITTLE JOHNNY Why ca n't I whistle ? JOHNNY I do n't know . LITTLE JOHNNY Maybe I 'll be able to whistle tomorrow . JOHNNY Maybe . LITTLE JOHNNY Do you like today ? JOHNNY Yes , I do . LITTLE JOHNNY Why ? JOHNNY I guess it 's because there 's just enough of yesterday and just enough of tomorrow in it to keep it from lasting forever . LITTLE JOHNNY Oh . ( Pause ) I like today , too , but I think I like tomorrow better . JOHNNY Why ? LITTLE JOHNNY Because every day I think tomorrow something wonderful is going to happen . p. 50 JOHNNY Something wonderful does happen every day . LITTLE JOHNNY I mean something so wonderful I ca n't even guess what it is . JOHNNY Ca n't you guess just a little ? LITTLE JOHNNY Well , it would be something wonderful that would happen to everybody . I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would be , more or less ? LITTLE JOHNNY Well , more or less , I think it would be  --  well , some kind of laughing . JOHNNY Oh . LITTLE JOHNNY It would be like some kind of wonderful fun  --  for everybody ! JOHNNY Oh . LITTLE JOHNNY Do you know what I mean ? JOHNNY Yes , I believe I do . LITTLE JOHNNY Well , every day I think it will happen tomorrow , but then when tomorrow comes , it does n't happen . Why is that ? JOHNNY Oh , that 's on account of  --  ( Pause ) I do n't know why that is . LITTLE JOHNNY It should happen , should n't it ? Or else why would I think it should happen ? p. 51 JOHNNY Yes , I think it should happen . LITTLE JOHNNY I wish it would happen tomorrow . Far away a rooster crows and before the rooster is finished crowing the darkness of night begins to change to the light of day . JOHNNY Well , here it is tomorrow , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I wish it would ! JOCK comes swinging in on a rope , like Tarzan of the Human Beings . With him is a shoe box , tied with a piece of string . He drops the shoe box , and then himself , does one push-up , leaps to his feet , bounces up and down , skips rope with an imaginary rope , and then does some deep and fancy breathing . ARIMATHEA This is my day ! JOHNNY Where you been , man ? ARIMATHEA ( Falling to the floor , to do some push-ups ) Up Mike 's , friend . One , two . One , two . One , two . ( He stops , up ) I 'm living on the roof now . One , two . One , two . One , two . ( He stops , up again ) I 'm living where I can see the lights of the city splashing and bubbling and skipping and going on and off . One , two . One , two . One , two . ( He stops , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city in the sky , and the stars and the moon . I 'm up now , you know  --  up Mike 's . One , two . ( He stops , up again ) I go up by ladder after dark , come down by rope before day-break . MOLLY , now wearing a young girl 's clothes , comes in and walks in front of JOCK as he does his push-ups , and the sight of her thrills him so he falls on his face . She is absolutely beautiful to behold , and her walking is like dancing . JOCK gets up , saying , Oh , Molly , Molly ! He stands and watches her as she walks in front of JOHNNY and LITTLE JOHNNY . She does a little morning dance , and then stops . LITTLE JOHNNY leaps down from the counter , walks to her , and very deliberately gives her a wallop on the behind . p. 52 MOLLY ( Thrilled ) Oh ! ( She turns and is surprised to see that it 's LITTLE JOHNNY ) JOHNNY ( Hurries over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! LITTLE JOHNNY You do it all the time ! JOHNNY Never mind . Now , tell the lady you 're sorry . LITTLE JOHNNY I 'm sorry . MOLLY Oh , that 's all right . JOHNNY He did it as a compliment , I know . He 's not insensible for his age , and if anything generous to a fault . Open-handed , I might say . I hope he did n't hurt you . MOLLY Oh , no . I hardly felt it . JOHNNY Well , thank you . I 'm at fault , not he . He has implicit faith in me . I do the same thing a dozen times a day to his mother . I wonder if I 've been mistaken in feeling that it pleases her . MOLLY Oh , I 'm sure it does . ARIMATHEA ( Coming into the group ) Excuse me , friends . ( He bows to LITTLE JOHNNY , giving him special importance ) Excuse me , Don Giovanni . I 'd like to ask a question . ( Pause ) Please look at these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brings out a pair of yellow button shoes ) Well , this is the question . ( Earnestly ) Do you like them ? p. 53 MOLLY Oh , yes , they 're beautiful ! ARIMATHEA Oh , Molly , Molly ! I 've got good news ! Last night I was dreaming as I walked down the street . I was dreaming of women and love and my feet . I was dreaming of Werther and Charlotte and shoes . Werther had a love for CharlotteSuch as words could never utter ; Would you know how first he met her ? She was cutting bread and butter . I was on my way home to the roof and the sky , and I felt so lowdown I thought I would die . Charlotte , having seen his bodyBrought before her on a shutter , Like a well-conducted person , Went on cutting bread and butter . Well , in the street comes up to me a business man , a man of money , a man about town , a ladies ' man from the word go , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these shoes  --  I purchased them in the year of Our Lord 1915 to wear to the San Francisco International Exposition and World 's Fair  --  but my valet misplaced them and only an hour ago found them again . They 're new shoes , he says , but I 'm not new , and you are , Felix , my boy . Well , I 'm taken by surprise , but just in time I remember that courtesy never goes out of style , so I decide not to push him out of the way . Excuse me , says I , am I to understand a pair of new shoes you bought to wear to the San Francisco International Exposition and World 's Fair are in that box ? Precisely , my boy , says he , and I want you to have them . Actual shoes ? says I. Why , yes , says he , laughing the way rich men do , brand-new yellow button shoes for you . Hah hah hah , he laughs ! but kindness is so sly and slick , I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need new shoes , and a jingle jangles in my blood:Safe in the world my head and heart , safe from all hurt ; My humble feet through faithless leather meet the dirt . But , oh , no man could say what wondrous use Young Jock could make of brand-new yellow button shoes ! ( He says " shoes " so that it will rhyme precisely with " use " ) I says to the old gent , Sir , I says , if it 's a gift of shoes you have for me , not Felix by name but Jock Arimathea , then I say God bless you , and thank you . Do n't mention it , my boy , says he , I thought they 'd go with the clothes you wear . He hands me the box , wishes me Godspeed , and leaves me standing in the street , a man with no mission , no message , and no money . Now , who works these merchant miracles ? Who keeps these foot schedules in the streets , without reason or rhyme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nick of time ? Is there a saint looking after my feet ? ( Pause ) Be that as it may , now I do n't know . They are shoes , that 's true , and they are new , although the time they were meant for is long gone from Kentucky , but shall I wear them ? That is the question . Shall I wear them , or let them stand as they are , as they 've stood these many years , pure and ornamental ? p. 54 MOLLY Oh , wear them , wear them ! You did n't steal them ! ARIMATHEA ( Amazed ) Steal them , Molly ? These shoes are antiques ! I 'd be hung for stealing shoes like these . In all the world another pair you could n't beg or borrow . ( To LITTLE JOHNNY ) What say you ? LITTLE JOHNNY Talk some more , talk some more ! We 're getting closer to tomorrow . ARIMATHEA Oh , bless my soul , words sweet as honey from his lips distilled ! Shakes his ambrosial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , the sanction of the god ! LITTLE JOHNNY More , more ! Tomorrow , tomorrow ! ARIMATHEA I knew your father , Lord Johnny my Joe , and you shall have more , and tomorrow and tomorrow . But first these shoes  --  To hesitate is death . And yet not to hesitate is also death . I 've hesitated and I 've not hesitated , and that 's either death twice , or death and life , or life and death , or death and resurrection . Lord Johnny , I would n't let them burn me at the stake for it , but what it is to hesitate or not to hesitate is more than I shall ever know . Maybe it 's birth . At any rate , I 'm still alive , I live under the sky , I 've got new shoes , and I know I 'm going to die . But three cheers for that , too . Hurrah hurrah hurrah ! ( Pause , solemnly ) Now , about these shoes  --  what am I going to do ? ( Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I 'm going to wear them . Why not ? I live only once , and once is enough , thanks . ( He sits down and takes off one of his old shoes and holds it before him ) This  --  my old shoe  --  peeyou !  --  and farewell . ( He tosses the shoe over his head ) And this , my other old shoe  --  adieu  --  go with thy brother , and for once go without me . Make thy way alone . I have kept thee to the straight path long enough . ( He tosses the second shoe over his head , puts on and buttons the new shoes , and stands ) Now , you new yellow button shoes  --  go ! begone ! lead me from sorrow , move me through yesterday , today , and tomorrow ! ( He walks gaily ) One , two , three , four ! One , two , three , four ! Open the window , open the door ! Hit , tip , thrip , frip ! Hit , tip , thrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( LITTLE JOHNNY claps his hands and laughs and walks behind him . MOLLY spins around him with gladness . Suddenly JOCK takes her by the hand and they strut about together , as if dancing , while LITTLE JOHNNY and TOMMY SINGH follow them . JOCK chants as he goes ) In my new yellow button shoesI bring you , love , the latest news:Goodwill to men , peace on earth:To each according to his worth.To each according to his need:To one the flower , to one the seed.Love for him who values love , Life for him who values life , Fun for him who values fun , Heaven for him who looks above , A wife for him who seeks a wife , A son for him who needs a son.Old age for him who would be old , And gold for him who would be sold . In my new yellow button shoesI bring you , love , still better news:We 'll go to heaven when we die.We 'll kiss our friends and say good-bye.And as I live and breathe earth 's air , In heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never had:A twinkling ocean green and glad , An island of flowers for your bed , A pillow of clouds for your head , A jazzband pushing through the roses:Hey ! bobareebob ! and Holy Moses ! Well , that 's all right for bye-and-bye ! That 's all right when the sun 's not high ! But now the sun is very high ! And when the sun is very high , Oh , Molly , Molly , you and I  --  You and I can never die ! Oh , Molly , Molly , never die ! During this dancing and chanting , INDIAN CHIEF JIM gets out of his wagon and joins the parade . He now wears the feather head-dress of the American Indian . FISHKIN comes in through the swinging doors and watches the fun and frolic with a mixture of scorn and envy , wanting to join the parade but not being able to do so . GIBBON falls in and joins the parade . The runaway girl gets up from her couch and watches , drawing close . The girl of the cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the cave.The old man in jail stands at the window and watches . p. 55 LITTLE JOHNNY ( Clapping his hands with joy ) Oh , that was good ! ( To JOHNNY ) It 's getting more and more like the wonderful fun I always think is going to happen tomorrow . Maybe today 's tomorrow ! ARIMATHEA I 'm thinking what a long time it is since everything began . What a coincidence it is that we are here together at last . What a pitiful short time until we shall be forever separated . What a longing there is in all things for one moment of being together , as we are now together . What a terror in the heart at the thought of absence . What evil mirth time takes in our galloping eagerness . What a loveliness you are , Molly ! Oh , Molly , Molly , what a loveliness you are ! I 'm thinking how it would be , Molly , for you and me to go walking out of here together . Just hold hands , Molly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful world and all the rest of beautiful time to ourselves . FISHKIN It would n't help ! ARIMATHEA Well , it would n't hinder ! ( He wags a finger under Fishkin 's nose ) The trouble with you is you 're looking for a profit all the time . FISHKIN It 's a lie ! A profit would n't help ! ARIMATHEA Do n't you think I know all about that myself ? You 're not the only man in the world who can see , you know . You 're not the only man who can hear . I 'm not deaf , you know . I hear the whispering as well as any man . p. 56 FISHKIN Then why do you pretend to be deaf ? ARIMATHEA In order to improve my hearing , that 's why . You 're so deaf the only piece in the orchestra you can hear is the drum , and you can only hear the drum when it 's close and loud . FISHKIN It 's a lie ! I hear the flutes and violins , too ! DANDY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it morning yet ? Has the sun come up ? ( Looking about , almost in panic ) Where 's the man ? Where 's Jim Crow ? ( Bellowing ) Jim Crow ! CROW ( Leaping to his feet but still asleep ) Make way for Mr. Jim Dandy ! FISHKIN Drop dead , he 's here ! CROW ( Blinking and looking about ) Where is he ? ( He finds JIM DANDY and begins to shine his shoes ) Yes , sir  --  Mr. Jim Dandy ! Put a little shine on the shoes ? DANDY ( Clickety-clack . JIM CROW stops shining his shoes and looks up at him . JIM DANDY speaks gently ) Jim , stand beside me . CROW ( Leaping beside him ) Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy ! p. 57 DANDY Last night in dream we walked together again beside the sea and searched the evening shore for the word in stone that would set us free  --  all of us  --  every man in the world . I from this fat and lethargy that I trip and stumble under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blockade . We searched , Jim , but we did not find , and a screaming wind blew night and rain and cold upon us , and lightning wrote in the pitch black sky  --  now or never , now or never . Find the blessed word or be done . Find it now or never again see day . We searched through the wet and slippery mouth of doom , and fell on rocks and became lost , one from the other , each man separate from the entire body and alone , all nature riven in a panic of tiny pieces , each piece fighting for its own poor life instead of for the one life of all together . We were done , Jim ! We 'd had our chance and we 'd failed . And then in the night I heard a girl weep , and saw the lightning write the blessed word  --  heart , heart , heart ! ( Pause ) The anguish of the weeping girl saved us in the nick of time , and we could try again . ( Pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our talisman  --  which is the bringing together again out of fear and panic into love and grace all the secret pieces of creation . CROW ( Whispering ) Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy ! ( He brings the heart-shaped rock out of his pocket and hands it to JIM DANDY ) p. 58 DANDY ( Pleased and excited ) The rock 's alive ! Look at it now , Jim ! Was it ever so before ? CROW ( Taking the rock and looking at it ) No , sir ! It was just a rock when we found it , but now it 's some kind of word , in some kind of language . DANDY ( Holding out the cushion of his chair ) Put it here for all to see . ( JIM CROW places the rock at the center of the cushion , and then places the cushion on the platform beside Jim Dandy 's chair ) I thank God for this beautiful morning ! And now , my stick please , and my exercise . CROW Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the platform , and together they walk up and down , while JOCK and MOLLY and THE MAHARAJAH and TOMMY SINGH and GIBBON and JOHNNY and LITTLE JOHNNY and the runaway girl and FISHKIN gather around the rock , to look at it . They are silent as they gather around , but after a moment everyone speaks , so that there is a babel of words and voices : ARIMATHEA Oh , Molly , Molly , look at the heart ! MOLLY It 's beautiful ! p. 59 MAHARAJAH Ooban , dooban , doo-loo-loo-loo , loo ! SINGH What does the rock say ? GIBBON The rock says God ! LITTLE JOHNNY Where did the rock come from ? JOHNNY It was nothing last night , but now it is the blessed word ! FISHKIN It 's a rock , that 's all it is ! JIM DANDY and JIM CROW stand outside the circle gathered around the rock . JIM DANDY presses the cricket : clickety-clack . CROW Make way for Mr. Jim Dandy , please ! ( The people make way . JIM DANDY picks up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the girl in the cave read the blessed word , and the prisoner in jail . CROW Yes , sir ! He moves slowly to the girl in the cave , holding the cushion with the rock on it before him . The girl is not frightened . She looks at the rock and then around at everybody , smiling , as if she had recognized something of her own . JIM CROW stands under the jail and lifts the cushion up to the old man at the window . The old man nods , JIM CROW lowers the cushion , takes the heart-shaped rock and puts it back into his pocket . He returns to JIM DANDY , places the cushion on the chair , and helps JIM DANDY settle himself . p. 60 DANDY ( Looking about at everyone ) I must have wine now , please . CROW Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy ! ( He runs and fetches another paper cup full of water , which he hands to JIM DANDY , who drinks it all down , while everybody watches ) FISHKIN Wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With anger ) You are a stupid man . No wine is sweeter than the wine that 's wanted and given when it 's called for . CROW ( Grateful to JOCK for rebuking FISHKIN ) Yes , sir ! FISHKIN It was water he drank ! DANDY ( Infuriated ) It 's water where your brain 's supposed to be , but not an ocean or a river  --  only a poison puddle in which the littlest fish of truth has long since perished . ( With contempt ) You are a waste of time ! You clutter the world ! CROW ( Bitterly angry at FISHKIN for upsetting JIM DANDY ) Yes , sir ! ( He falls to his knees ) Stand on my back and tell him ! Stand on Jim Crow 's back and tell the foolish man about the laws of giving . ( He bends forward ) p. 61 DANDY ( Hushed by Jim Crow 's devotion and understanding ) You shame me , Jim . You are my staff , my pulpit and my platform , but now , stand up . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they see . ( He takes JIM CROW by the arm and helps him up ) Let your eyes see where my eyes see . Up , up ! You are a panther in the night . God help your enemies when the panther finds the light . As for myself , I 'll tell you what , Jim Crow  --  I have no enemies , I am the enemy of none . Hunger was my father , my mother was fun . I 'll tell the good man the laws of giving , and I 'll tell myself the laws of forgiving . The law of each is love . Jim , you are the panther of it . ( Of GIBBON ) There 's the dog . ( Of FISHKIN ) There 's the frog . ( Pointing to the old man in the window of the jail ) Noah 's in jail . The jail 's his ark . ( Of JOHNNY ) There 's the whale . ( Of LITTLE JOHNNY ) There 's the shark . ( Walking about now , pointing and tapping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fox . ( Of TOMMY SINGH ) There 's the ox . ( Of the runaway girl ) There 's the hen who mothers eggs of glass . ( Of MOLLY ) Yonder 's the butterfly come to pass . ( Of JOCK ) There 's the falcon high above . ( Of the girl in the cave ) And there in the cave is the dove ! p. 62 CROW ( Softly ) Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy ! FISHKIN ( Bitterly ) He calls me frog ! For telling the truth I 'm despised and called names . Well , it would n't help ! He drank water , whoever he is . DANDY ( Gently ) Perhaps it was not even water . FISHKIN Not water ? ( He runs to the water jar , fills a paper cup , gulps a mouthful and squirts it out ) Water ! ( To the others , almost appealing to them ) Who is he ? Who is he to come here and take my chair and wave a common stick from a tree this way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? His talisman which is nothing more than a common rock from the shore of the sea . His silly dreams , and his big talk ? Who is he to call me frog ? Who is he to come here with his private slave ? CROW Slave ? ! ( JIM CROW leaps on FISHKIN , taking him by the throat ) DANDY ( Shouting ) Jim ! ( JIM CROW stops choking FISHKIN ) Let him be , please ! ( JIM CROW releases FISHKIN and draws away ) FISHKIN ( Trembling with fear and rage ) I 'm not afraid ! You asked for wine and he gave you water and you drank water ! If you call it wine you mock truth . ( Of JIM CROW ) He has a rock in his pocket that you call a talisman . It is a rock , shaped by accident like a heart . If you call it anything but a rock you mock truth . You wave a stick as if waving it were not nonsense . If you say it is something more than nonsense you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enslaving him . If you say he is not enslaved you mock truth . You would put the truth back a thousand years and make savages of us all . I tell the truth and I 'm not afraid of you or your slave ! p. 63 CROW ( Trying to control himself ) No call for sass ! You go away with your truth ! ( He moves toward FISHKIN helplessly ) FISHKIN I tell the truth ! ( Backing away fearfully and lifting his voice ) I tell the truth ! CROW What kind of truth you tell , man ? You tell the lying kind ? FISHKIN The truth , the truth ! CROW I gave Jim Dandy wine ! I 'm not a slave . I 'm a free man . I gave him wine . FISHKIN ( Bolting suddenly ) You gave him water ! ( He plunges into the revolving door ) I tell the truth ! JIM CROW chases after FISHKIN into the revolving door , and they push around swiftly , the bells and strips of glass ringing and jingling and tinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform and goes to the revolving door and stops it , and FISHKIN and JIM CROW step out of it by turns . FISHKIN is terrified and gets as far away from JIM CROW as possible . DANDY ( To JIM CROW ) Help me to my chair , please . ( JIM CROW helps him into his chair , then stands before him . FISHKIN stands near by , nervous and miserable ) p. 64 CROW He make me mad ! Call me slave ! Sass and sass and scream ! DANDY What did you mean to do Jim ? CROW I break his neck ! DANDY ( Working his lips , his whole enormous face on the verge of tears ) No , Jim . That 's not the way . Tell him you 're sorry he made you angry . CROW Tell him that ? Tell that man I 'm sorry ? There he is now , watching and hiding behind your kindness . DANDY Tell him not to be afraid . ( Gently ) Tell him , Jim . CROW ( Softly ) I tell him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , man . Do n't be afraid . DANDY Thank you , Jim . ( He steps down from his chair , takes FISHKIN by the arm ) Come . Sit down in your chair . ( FISHKIN is terribly frightened . JIM DANDY helps him into the chair ) Please go on . FISHKIN Go on ? DANDY You were interrupted a moment ago , but now go on . Tell the truth . FISHKIN What truth ? p. 65 DANDY Any truth . All truth . Tell the story of your life . Or if you prefer the story of my life . ( Of JIM CROW ) Or his . ( FISHKIN fidgets . JIM DANDY speaks with kindness ) You 're frightened . You need n't be . What happened was nothing more than a moment 's continuation of fitful sleep . Let us say it was dreamed , and forget it . You are secure . ( Of JIM CROW ) He 's gentler than I , and I love all things , as pity must or be disgust . ( To JIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't him you meant to stop , it was the rust . ( Gently ) We know he did n't mean to bury us  --  it was dreamed , but now we are awake . Blow it well , Jim . ( JIM CROW blows the bugle : clear , pure , slow , gentle and somber ) Tell the truth . FISHKIN ( Gulping , his mouth dry ) I ca n't talk . DANDY You 're still afraid . I tell you , you need n't be . Here . I 'll be to you , him to me . ( He begins to shine Fishkin 's shoes with a fancy but very dirty handkerchief , then stops and stands ) Here 's the cricket . Here 's the stick . Press the cricket , wave the stick , ask to see the talisman , ask for wine  --  or not . You are secure and free . Sleep , if you like . But you were interrupted in the midst of speech and your theme was truth . I ask you , as a kindness to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave . Then I say I 'm yours , for we are all the same . p. 66 FISHKIN The same ? DANDY It does n't matter who 's quick or handy ; who 's lean or fat , father or son . Every living man is Jim Dandy . All who live are one . Tell the truth . FISHKIN ( Slowly , with great effort ) Well , in the daytime there is light . DANDY ( Almost excited ) That 's right ! FISHKIN At night there is darkness . DANDY ( More excited ) Quite right , quite right ! FISHKIN Some days are as dark as some nights , and some nights are as light as some days . DANDY Go on , go on ! FISHKIN After every night is dawn and day . After every day is evening and night . Every day is the same in some things and different in others , and so it is with every night . Everybody begins in darkness , and everybody is the same in some things and different in others , but mainly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . He looks around , clutching Jim Dandy 's stick ) In the morning , if you have slept during the night and have had no pain , there is goodness in all things , even in things not right , but sometimes morning is worse than noon or night . ( He stops a moment , taps the stick nervously , and accidentally presses the cricket : clickety-clack . JIM CROW offers him a cigar , but he shakes his head , and JIM CROW hands the cigar to JIM DANDY , lights it for him , and JIM DANDY smokes the cigar as he listens ) At noon sometimes it is possible to laugh . If your mother and father laughed together in the night of your beginning , it is sometimes possible to laugh in the morning , but if they wept in that night it is better to laugh at noon . Noontime is sometimes better than morning , but if the people you know have died or quarreled noontime is worse than any time at all and you could be buried where you stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this the story ? p. 67 DANDY It is . Do not stop . Tell it all . FISHKIN In the evening , just before the sun goes down , there is singing . For a moment then many who are not often men are angels , and speak to one another without words . If the evening song is joyous the air is filled with kissing , but if the song is mournful the lips of things long only for food . As the light dims , the hum and push of action ends , and even in overcrowded places every man is alone . Before the day falls like a leaf from a tree standing beside a stream , every rock and pebble takes a breath and every man breathes it out . ( He stops ) What am I saying ? This is not my way of speaking . ( Slowly ) My name is Fishkin . DANDY Your name is Jim Dandy . Tell the story . FISHKIN My name is Jim Dandy ? ( JIM DANDY nods , FISHKIN goes on helplessly ) At night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or turn on electric lights , but it 's no use . The dream returns to carry on its secret work . The speechless fall down to sleep , and sleeping speak , using every device of breath and lung , jaw and mouth , tongue and teeth , and all the words of races dead and gone , the words for father and mother , sister and brother , son and daughter , neighbor and friend . And all the numbers of things , and all the signs . In the light of day , while they are awake , the speechless stutter and lisp and wait for night again , and then say oh and ah , hello Ma , hello Pa , hey Jenny , hey Joe , ha ha and ho ho , ah-ha and alas . Alas , alas . The night is parent and home , school and church , starting-point and destination . ( Suddenly ) My throat is dry ! Give me wine or I shall die . ( JIM DANDY strolls to the water jar , fills a paper cup , returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hands the cup back to JIM DANDY . FISHKIN looks around ) That is the truth , and the whole story . ( INDIAN CHIEF JIM shakes the tambourine and taps on it . MOLLY dances . The runaway girl hums softly ) p. 68 DANDY There is more . FISHKIN That is how it is . Light in the daytime , darkness at night . Every man comes out of the darkness into the light and moves , and as the nights and days come and go every man seeks , and seeking grows and changes until he is himself , and then suddenly is not , and then suddenly is , and then again suddenly is not . Every man seeks truth and God and meaning and peace and love and laughter and fun and food and honor and  --  and  --  DANDY Go on , say it ! FISHKIN ( Quickly ) Disgrace and death ? ( With passion ) No , not disgrace and death ! Merriment and miracle . Innocence and grace . Mercy and wisdom . ( Softly , almost painfully , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how he grows and changes , no matter who he is and then is not and then is again , no matter what he seeks and finds , or does not seek and has thrust upon him , or seeks and does not find , or finds and cherishes , or finds and destroys , in the end , every man stops ! Breathing stops and oh and ah , moving stops and hey Jenny and hey Joe , and a man goes strolling without legs or feet . Yes , it 's so , but only half a block down the street he is walking again in a hundred thousand others going home from work . ( He stops ) I believe that is the whole truth and the whole story . p. 69 DANDY ( Gently ) Who spoke ? FISHKIN I do n't know . Not me . DANDY ( Of JIM CROW ) Was it he ? FISHKIN I do n't know . DANDY ( Of LITTLE JOHNNY ) He ? FISHKIN I do n't remember . DANDY ( Of MOLLY ) She ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was none of us . FISHKIN Who was it , then ? DANDY Jim Dandy , friend . FISHKIN Excuse me , please . Who is Jim Dandy ? DANDY Here , among these rocks and ruins , I am Jim Dandy , but that is only because the eye is still so dim and feeble , so swift and yet so slow . Jim Dandy is the companion . FISHKIN Who ? DANDY The brother , the partner , the pal of all things : glue , gum and bloom ; rust , dust and decay ; water , wind and fire ; lightning and flood ; beginning and blight ; but these are only the poor words for the brother . p. 70 FISHKIN Do I know him ? DANDY Better than you know yourself . You met at the time of the immemorial meeting in the immemorial night , and having once met you meet again in every minute of every day and every night . You met when you were pushed into the circle . You met when the only two met and bungled you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which two that bungled me forth ? DANDY The one and the other which are the one and only . FISHKIN My father and my mother ? DANDY As you prefer , since we deal in words . FISHKIN And the one and only  --  who 's he ? DANDY Their best , their most , their least , their worst . FISHKIN Fishkin ? This body and this face ? DANDY And the man inside , the dog or the frog there , or the hawk or the hare , or all of them together  --  all that we can not see . FISHKIN I feel out of place . May I get down ? DANDY At any height , at any depth , no man is out of place , but get down if you please . ( He helps FISHKIN out of the chair and off the platform , taking back the cricket and the stick . He gets into the chair , looks around , working his lips ) Move along to your skills now , please . Be jolly ! Be gay ! Dance the dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recite and make speeches , or give a play . Follow your noses . ( Of LITTLE JOHNNY ) Entertain the new man there , and one another . ( Of the girl in the cave ) Comfort our mother and daughter in the cave . ( Of the old man in jail ) Beguile the lonely prisoner . Give a play . p. 71 ARIMATHEA I 'll do my part . FISHKIN May I be in the play , too ? I promise to believe in it and give a good performance . DANDY You are in the play . ( Clickety-clack ) Now start . ( He waves his stick at JOCK ) You are the manager . First clear the stage . Put the boy in a comfortable place and let him watch until he 's tired . Then let him close his eyes to this play and open them to the play on the stage of his sleep . ( JOCK takes LITTLE JOHNNY to the counter and sits him down on it ) Now , the girl . Her place is to the side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part is to dance . ( JOCK takes MOLLY to one side , where she waits to dance ) That 's right . ( He looks up at the old man in jail and calls out to him ) Prisoner and friend , play a part if you like . ( To TOMMY SINGH ) Soldier , thrash about or stop or sing or say a line , as you see fit . ( To the runaway girl ) Last night in my sleep it was you who wept and saved us all . Weep no more . This play is for you . Be glad ! This is a better time ! LITTLE JOHNNY Yes , yes !  --  it 's tomorrow ! p. 72 DANDY It is , it is ! ( To INDIAN CHIEF JIM ) Indian Chief , play your part . ( To GIBBON ) Join in , Gibbon .

ARIMATHEA I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOLLY ) Hear them speak and move as their playing moves you . I shall know the quality of the play from the manner in which you occupy your space . ( To JOCK ) Begin , then . ARIMATHEA Places , everybody ! Ready ! Now , let the play begin ! The curtain comes down@@ Now the scene is full of the light of noon , and the time is the time of the play . JOCK , the manager , is at the center of the stage . JIM DANDY sits in his chair . JIM CROW sits at his feet . LITTLE JOHNNY , sitting on the librarian 's counter , watches eagerly . JOHNNY sits on two or three books , with his back propped up against the counter . The runaway girl stands beside the cash register . The little girl stands inside the cave , looking out . INDIAN CHIEF JIM is in his wagon , GIBBON is lying in front of it . FISHKIN stands beside the tree . The old man in jail clutches the bars , waiting for the play to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings his arm down , like a conductor leading an orchestra . His finger points to TOMMY SINGH , who begins his march . JOCK brings his arm down again , his finger pointed this time to INDIAN CHIEF JIM , who beats softly on the drums in his wagon . JOCK brings his arm down a third time , pointing to MOLLY , who enters the revolving door and pushes around in it once , steps out , and dances slowly , lifting her arms and moving them , but scarcely moving her body . TOMMY SINGH halts , puts away his rifle , takes up the stringed instrument , and strums on it . ARIMATHEA ( Announcing ) The name of our play is Man Alive . Or Adam Driven from the Garden . Or The Life , Time and Fortune of Our Lord Jim , or Johnny , or Jack , or Joe . Or Jim in Search of the Holy Grail . Or Jim in the Garden of Tomorrow Yesterday Today . Or Jim Forever Now or Never . Or Jim  --  p. 74 DANDY ( Clickety-clack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with the play ! To find the proper name you 'd need to talk the rest of your life . Skip the furniture and get to the poetry . ARIMATHEA Yes , sir . To the poetry . ( Slight pause ) Our audience is the Creator . ( He looks up , as if in prayer ) Our wish is to please You , Sir . FISHKIN ( Stepping forward ) It would n't help ! ( Swiftly ) Oh , I 'm sorry ! ( To JIM DANDY ) All my life I 've been myself  --  Fishkin  --  and it 's not easy suddenly to become someone else  --  but I shall try again ! I shall try with all my might . ( To the girl in the cave ) It would help ! ( To the runaway girl ) It would help ! ( To LITTLE JOHNNY ) It would help ! ( Looking up ) It would help , Sir ! ARIMATHEA On , then , to the poetry . LITTLE JOHNNY What 's poetry ? ARIMATHEA Lord Johnny my Joe , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNNY ) Is poetry the fun that 's going to happen tomorrow ? p. 75 JOHNNY Perhaps , but let us behold the play . DANDY A good question deserves an answer , good or bad . I 'll start the answer , let another carry it forward . The answer will give the play its tone , and be its prologue . What is poetry ? Poetry is all of the experience of all of the people . It is all of the experience of all of the animals , whether free in nature or held prisoner in circus or zoo . It is all of the things on earth and all around it , seen or unseen , known or unknown . It is all of the past and the present and the future ; and it is also all of the past which was not , all of the present that is not , all of the future that shall not be . It is all of the weather . It is all of the way things are , and all of the way things are not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way things might have been or might become . It is all of the action of things , whether outer and open , or inner and secret . Poetry is all . There is nothing which is not poetry , but let another take the ball . ARIMATHEA Indian Chief , what is poetry ? MAHARAJAH Poetry is talk . A name spoken is poetry , as Al . The alphabet is poetry , each letter of it is simple and mysterious poetry . Talk is poetry . Printed talk is holy poetry . p. 76 ARIMATHEA ( To JOHNNY ) What say you ? JOHNNY Amen . LITTLE JOHNNY ( Thrilled and delighted ) Faster , faster ! ARIMATHEA ( To the man in jail ) Prisoner , what is poetry ? ADAMS Thank you , manager , for I am a writer of poems . I say poetry is passion that kills with kissing , for here I am cooped in a cage , who told them on the printed page to live and love , and taught them the measures of abundance and replenishment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice shaking ) Old now , and lunatic they say , I 'm held tight in this coffin , buried alive , and deprived of the happy death I worked for all my life . You , my friends , did not put me in this shameful grave , but you did not stop the evil machinery that did . You say my name every day , as though it were the name for bread . Before you say that name again , I shall be truly dead . To write a poem  --  to live a poem  --  is not grace alone , but grace and disgrace , and no man breathes who is not in his own poor person both poet and poem . ( He stops to catch his breath ) Thank you for your kindness in allowing me to speak , but faster , faster , as the young man says , do not hold up the play . Do not let the wonder of it get away . p. 77 ARIMATHEA ( To FISHKIN ) Fishkin , Fishkin , what is poetry ? FISHKIN ( Mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is foolishness ! ( Furious with himself , punching the palm of his left hand with his clenched fist ) Oh , Fishkin ! Fishkin ! ( He falls as a football player falls when he has had his hands on the thrown ball but has not been able to hang onto it  --  as if he wanted to be buried from disappointment and shame . He gets up quickly , almost with a leap ) Listen to me , everybody , please ! I ask you with all my heart and soul to forgive me once again ! I promise that from now on I am a new man . I am no longer Fishkin the Fool , Fishkin the Fraud , Fishkin the Fearful . ( Slight pause ) No . Now I am Fishkin the Friend ! Fishkin the Fighter , the Forceful , the Fearless , the Fascinating  --  the Faithful ! Yes , that 's who I am  --  Fishkin the Faithful ! ARIMATHEA One moment please , Fishkin the Futile ! FISHKIN The Faithful , the Faithful , not the Futile ! ARIMATHEA Faithful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play . LITTLE JOHNNY ( Delighted with FISHKIN ) More , more ! I know something 's going to happen . Let it happen . More , Fishkin , more ! p. 78 FISHKIN ( Thrilled , almost weeping ) You see ? He said my name ! He said Fishkin and loved me . He wants more . He wants more of Fishkin ! ( Powerfully ) Fishkin the Full-toned ! ARIMATHEA Fishkin the Fox-terrier ! FISHKIN No , no , not the Fox-terrier ! Fishkin the  --  the  --  ARIMATHEA The Frightful ? Fishkin the Frightful ? FISHKIN ( Deeply hurt ) No , no ! You have no right to make fun of the good man I wish to be . ( To JIM DANDY ) He has no right . I wish to be somebody fine in the play  --  a poet , perhaps  --  but he 's making fun of me . In the play I can at least pretend to be fortunate , ca n't I ? I can pretend to be Fishkin the Fortunate , ca n't I ? The girl of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl dances slowly , moving from behind the counter . LITTLE JOHNNY More , Fishkin , more ! DANDY Manager , let the player play his part . His performance delights the boy whose delight delights me , and he moves the girl of the cave to dancing , which fills my heart with hope and love . And look , the girl who wept for us now dances , too ! Already the play has made her glad . Now we are truly saved ! p. 79 FISHKIN ( Thrilled ) You see ? You see ? LITTLE JOHNNY Faster , faster ! Tell us who you are , Fishkin ! FISHKIN I 'll tell you who I am . I 'm Fishkin the Famous ! Yes , that 's who I am . Everybody knows me . ( MOLLY dances appropriately while THE MAHARAJAH and TOMMY SINGH supply music . The girl of the cave watches MOLLY and tries to dance like her . The runaway girl joins them , and dances with them ) Children cry with joy as I pass by . Men cheer when I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see me . Thieves give back their loot when I glance at them . The sinful drop their corruption when I turn to them . The suffering are relieved of their pain at the sound of my voice . The mad are soothed when I reach out to them . The forsaken seek me for comfort . The weary are refreshed when they remember me . I am Fishkin the Famous ! The sun in the sky knows me , and the moon , and the stars ! The wind whispers my name to ears far and near  --  ( Whispers )  --  Fishkin  --  Fishkin ! LITTLE JOHNNY ( Delighted ) And the cows , Fishkin . What do the cows do ? FISHKIN ( Amazed at the question ) The cows ? p. 80 LITTLE JOHNNY Yes , Fishkin , what do the cows do ? FISHKIN ( Confident again ) The black cows and the white cows , the brown and the red , they climb the lonely green hills to look for me . They stand on the hills and look and look . They stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they lie down . LITTLE JOHNNY And the flowers , Fishkin . What do they do ? FISHKIN ( To JIM DANDY ) Flowers ? DANDY ( Delighted with what 's happening to FISHKIN ) Yes , of course , the flowers ! Tell the boy what they do . Tell Jim Crow and tell me . Tell the dancing girls : the mother , the sister , and the daughter ! ARIMATHEA ( Stunned and thrilled ) Yes , that 's right ! FISHKIN ( Himself again ) Drop dead ! ( Swiftly , desperately ) Oh , I 'm sorry ! Forgive me !  --  forgive me , but how should I know what the flowers do ? ARIMATHEA ( Excited ) Look at Molly , look at Molly ! ( Everybody , including FISHKIN , turns to look at MOLLY , who is dancing beautifully ) Look at Molly and her sister who is glad now , and her unborn daughter who is no longer afraid . Look at my wife , my sister , and my daughter ! Oh , look at them ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth and dance for me . Big flowers and little flowers , they explode into a hundred forms and colors  --  violet , daisy , sun-flower , lily and rose ! LITTLE JOHNNY ( With wonder and delight ) Violet , daisy , sun-flower , lily and rose ! FISHKIN Flowers run down the hills , dance at my feet , and sing to me ! They laugh and play , and ring bells , and whisper to me , and when they whisper the air is filled with sweet perfume . LITTLE JOHNNY What do the flowers whisper Fishkin ? FISHKIN They whisper Fishkin  --  Fishkin ! Every flower whispers Fishkin ! LITTLE JOHNNY And the snow , Fishkin ! What does the snow do ? FISHKIN ( Himself again , stunned by the preposterous question ) How should I know what the snow does ? ( He stops , trying to think , while the dancing girls change their dance from a flower dance to a snow dance ) The snow comes down , that 's what it does . LITTLE JOHNNY No , no , Fishkin ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pathetically , to JIM DANDY ) I want to give a good performance , but there is no answer to that question . More than anything else in the world I want to give a good account of myself , and it 's about time , too , but what can I say ? He believes there is something the snow does that 's wonderful ! But what could that possibly be ? And why does he presume that I know ? Let someone else tell him what the snow does . LITTLE JOHNNY No , no , Fishkin ! Only you can say what the snow does . Only you ! FISHKIN ( To JIM DANDY ) In all my life no man has ever expected so much of me , nor have I ever before longed so desperately to live up to expectations , but what can I tell him ? What do I know about snow ? ( Trying very hard ) Well , once in Buffalo when it snowed I nearly froze . ( Disgusted ) No , no , no , that 's not it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ) I nearly froze ! So what ? Who cares ? So I nearly froze , where 's the poetry in that ? ( Trying again ) And then , once in New York , it snowed three weeks , and every night on my way home from work the kids in the street hit me with snowballs  --  ( Disgusted again ) But what nonsense is that ? That 's not what he wants at all . ( Impatient with himself , angry and swift ) The snow comes down , that 's all I know . It comes down , and down , and down ! ( Suddenly , exulting ) That 's it ! I 've got it now ! ( Turning to LITTLE JOHNNY , performing for all he 's worth , softly , eloquently ) Down , down , down , and down ! The snow is soft and cool , and when it brushes your cheek , you wonder who it is that 's kissing you . You wonder who loves you so , to kiss you so . You wonder if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves you so . You wonder if it is n't all the people of the world  --  the millions and millions you 've never seen . You wonder if it is n't the millions and millions who lived long ago but live no more , but kiss you because you live . Snow is kissing ! ( His voice suddenly hushed ) The snow kisses as if it were woman lovely again  --  your own mother or wife or daughter , lovely forever , kissing you again and again . The snow comes down shy and soft and silent , and puts shyness and softness and silence into all things  --  the field , the city , the street , the home , the heart ! p. 83 LITTLE JOHNNY ( His voice somber and hushed ) What does the snow say , Fishkin ? FISHKIN ( As if in a trance , as if he were standing alone in the world , in a snow-storm ) The snow says sleep ! I love you ! Sleep ! Sleep ! Be still now , I love you ! ( Almost inaudible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fishkin ? FISHKIN ( Almost but not quite coming out of the trance , furious and powerful , almost arrogant ) Yes , yes , that 's what it says ! ( Softly but powerfully ) Fishkin ! Fishkin ! ( Softer ) Sleep , Fishkin ! Be still now , Fishkin ! Sleep ! I love you , Fishkin ! Sleep ! Sleep , Fishkin ! ( Pause ) Fishkin ! Fishkin ! ( He stops and looks around , coming out of the trance , his voice hushed and humble ) That 's what the snow says . ADAMS ( Excited , delighted , his voice shaking with emotion ) Bravo , Fishkin ! Bravo ! You have been in your own person a great poem ! To be a poem is to let go . It is to live and let live , and to hang for it . Now you stand with me , Fishkin ! You are a friend of the family now , Fishkin ! You are a father now , Fishkin ! There is no child in the world now who is not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ! p. 84 FISHKIN Thank you , old man , but I know what I am . I am a fool ! Now , let me sit down and think about it . ( He sits on the platform beside JIM CROW ) ARIMATHEA Next player , step forward , please ! ( Slight pause ) Gibbon ? GIBBON Thank you , manager . I 'll do my part , for now I am a friend of the family , too . ARIMATHEA Then take the stage and recite , or sing , or dance . GIBBON ( Taking the center of the stage ) The Indian saved me from Barnum . I saved myself from Bailey . I shall not dance , my feet are much too big for it . The Indian taught me courtesy , I shall not sing . I came by speech most painfully , I shall not recite . Instead , let me remember a little of my life , and then let the play be uncluttered of me . ( Pause ) My deepest memory reaches no deeper than the cage whose door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my freedom I stayed beside the cage , beside the man who set me free . I stayed among men , first out of curiosity , then hatred , then envy , then love , and then  --  forgive me  --  pity . I 've always wanted to know who 's closer to me , brute animal or gentle man . Well , now I know . I 've read the books of men until the hair fell off my skin , and my forehead grew high and wide , and my eyes dim . First I read of men , but that did not answer my question , so then I read of all life . I read of the rock wallaby with his boy in his pouch . I read of the bat , the lion , the wolf , the beaver , the camel , the giraffe , the zebra , the elephant , the whale . These are my brothers , and yours , and we have sisters , and I read of them . And I read of our half-brothers and half-sisters , too . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Closest to me is the sky and the sea , the earth and its breath , the brook and the tree . Closest to me is that which is closest to you , Our Father . I thank Him for my life , however foolish it may seem , and for my friends , however unaccountable they may be . p. 85 FISHKIN ( Himself again , but softly and without venom ) Drop dead , drop dead ! ARIMATHEA Gibbon , I told you not to read ! GIBBON I did not learn what little I know from reading alone . Reading did not give me eyes . I always had them . I have learned most from the reading of faces , not books . From the reading of bodies , postures , hands , feet , rhythms . I have always had good hearing . I have learned much from voices in speech and song , shouts and whispers , sighs and moans , laughter and weeping . I have learned that ape or man , rock wallaby or elephant , that which lives and moves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the One Father , longs to walk with Him on this Earth , and to return to Him in sleep , or true birth . DANDY You 've lived well , man ! GIBBON Did you say man ? ARIMATHEA A slip of the tongue . He meant Gibbon . At any rate he meant you . GIBBON ( To JIM DANDY ) I thank you for the kindness , but alas , I 'm past being better than I am . This is Gibbon , as you say . Better Gibbon Gibbon stay . Half-man , half-ape , but not half enough what he ought to be . ARIMATHEA And what ought Gibbon to be ? p. 86 GIBBON Gibbon ought Our Father 's to be . Not Barnum 's , not Bailey 's , but the Creator 's . ARIMATHEA Are you a missionary come from the jungle to the public square ? Are you a preacher come to save the heathen man ? What crank religion have you brought with you , Gibbon ? GIBBON No gospel the rocks do not preach . No religion the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lily of the valley does not proclaim . No blessing or benediction the sun itself does not make . No hosanna the birds do not sing . No baptism the rain does not bestow . No beatitude the beauty of all living does not impart . No religion which excludes any living thing from a share in holiness , divinity , consecration , grace or sanctity . I have no choice but to worship God , for God worships me ! I am imprisoned in His worship , which rids me of all vanity . ( He lies down in front of the wagon ) ADAMS Amen , Gibbon ! Amen ! FISHKIN ( Standing suddenly and striding about ) Ahkhp ! I 'd trade it all for a piece of bread ! ( The light begins to dim ) LITTLE JOHNNY Hah hah hah ! Fishkin 's the best ! He wants a piece of bread ! He does n't care ! He wants to eat ! Hah hah hah ! Hurrah for Fishkin ! p. 87 ARIMATHEA ( To FISHKIN ) All right , daredevil , take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take , but do n't you take your time . The play 's got pace , it 's going well , let 's see to it that it gets somewhere . Lord Johnny says hurrah for you ! What do you say to that ? FISHKIN Hurrah hurrah . I 'm hungry ! What can I say to hurrah ? ( Pointing to LITTLE JOHNNY ) The critic gives me soul , but my flesh is famished . The critic makes me proud , but if the clouds were to rain bread , I 'd drop my pride and leap upon the stuff like a hound upon a bone . I 'd not bother to think if I had bread . To speak is dry exercise for the jaws , and no joy at all for the belly . In the end it makes the head ache , too . I 'm ready to come to terms . Give me bread and I 'll sue for peace and have no more of war . Give me bread and I 'll give my jaws their proper exercise . Give me bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me bread and may God forgive me I 'll say black is white , wrong is right , day is night , and so on and so forth  --  give me bread ! Let the juices of my mouth have better stuff to work upon than words and I 'll sum up all wisdom with a grunt ! I 'll belch peace on earth , just give me bread ! Let Fishkin 's belly tighten with the stuff of life  --  let Fishkin 's failing chemistry dance by the fire of fuel in the furnace  --  let Fishkin 's lonely sleep put its arms around a memory or a hope made of wheat and not philosophy  --  and then , my friends , just say to Fishkin how do you do , and he 'll not say drop dead , he 'll smile and nod his head . How do you do ? Why , the top of the morning to you , more power to you , better luck next time , keep your chin up , every cloud has a silver lining , tomorrow 's another day , cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on and so forth , and so on and so forth ! I 'm hungry ! Give me bread and I 'll kill myself ! ( The light grows dimmer ) p. 88 LITTLE JOHNNY Hah hah hah ! Do it , Fishkin ! Kill yourself ! FISHKIN I will , on my word of honor , but where 's my bread ? ( Looking around at everybody ) Who 'll give Fishkin bread , so he 'll kill himself ? Anyone ? ( Swiftly ) Thank God , for it was a poor bargain and raised the cost of living a little too high . LITTLE JOHNNY Oh , just pretend ! Just pretend , Fishkin ! How would you do it ? FISHKIN To speak the truth , I do n't believe I 'd need to do it . The very shock and joy of it would kill me ! ( Earnestly , a little pathetically , as if the make-believe had slipped over into terrible reality ) I am hungry ! Has anyone a piece of bread ? Oh , I 'll not kill myself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you like return to the stage . Not a loaf of bread , just a piece . ADAMS ( Earnestly ) I have bread , Fishkin . You may have it . FISHKIN ( Trying very hard not to run , almost stumbling and falling as he hurries to the jail ) Bread , old man ? You were kind to me a moment ago . You said I 'm a friend of the family , and a father . Surely you would not mock me . I am hungry , old man . Have you bread ? A little piece ? p. 89 ADAMS I have , Fishkin . Here . I 'll not talk about it . ( He holds a small portion of a round dark loaf ) It is n't much . I 'll drop it to you . Are you ready ? FISHKIN ( Reaching , his voice fierce with hunger ) Drop it , drop it ! before I drop dead ! ( JACK ADAMS lets the bread fall from his hand . FISHKIN fails to catch the bread which bounces and rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it ) Bread ! Bread ! ( He tears at the bread with his teeth , almost snarling . He begins to hum and sob as he chews and swallows , walking about in a blind delirium , bumping into things , biting the bread and then clutching it to him , so that no one will snatch it away from him . Suddenly , with his mouth full , he stops moving and stops chewing . He gulps the bread in his mouth down , without pleasure , and looks around at everybody ) Oh , I 'm ashamed ! Listen , my friends ! You must forgive me ! You must forgive Fishkin ! ( To JIM CROW ) Free man , share this bread with me . ( He holds the bread out to JIM CROW who stands obviously wanting a share of it but ashamed to take it when so many are hungry ) Please share the bread with me . I know you 're as hungry as I. Have your share of the old man 's bread , then pass it along to the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool of myself , acting and not acting . Please share the bread ! p. 90 DANDY ( To JIM CROW ) Take it , Jim ! Take your share of the bread ! ( Turning suddenly and shouting to JACK ADAMS ) We thank you , old poet ! We thank you for your mercy , noble Noah ! ( Shouting at JIM CROW ) Jim , for God 's sake , take your share and pass the loaf along ! CROW ( Accepts the bread from FISHKIN , but does not take a share . He begins to do so , and then stops . He speaks to JIM DANDY in a whisper ) There 's so little of it , Mr. Jim Dandy , and I 'm so hungry , and we 're so many ! Please , Mr. Jim Dandy , you take my share ! DANDY ( Standing and shouting , his mouth wet with saliva ) Jim , for God 's sake , I 'm a fat man in a famine !  --  but I can not take your share of that bread ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Jim , if you love me , take your share ! CROW ( Quickly ) Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy ! He breaks off a piece of the bread and pushes it into his mouth and chews savagely , closing his eyes . He puts the rest of the bread into Jim Dandy 's trembling hands . JIM DANDY tears into the bread with his teeth , and hums as he chews . He thrusts the loaf out in front of him , his eyes shut , so that he will not be tempted to take more than his share . Nobody moves to take the bread from his hands . He stands , chewing and humming and gulping , and rocking on his feet . p. 91 DANDY For the love of God , somebody take the loaf from my hand ! Though large and starved , I am one man and I 've had my share . Somebody take the loaf ! ( Shouting ) Gibbon ! If you love a brother , take the loaf ! Deliver me from temptation ! ( GIBBON takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands a moment , rocking , and then opens his eyes . JIM CROW is beside him now , and helps him back into the chair ) Forgive me , Fishkin , I took more than my share . FISHKIN You took less than I. The loaf 's still there . ( Almost to himself ) A moment ago I was starved , but now my hunger is strangely satisfied . I do not understand . I have never felt so warm or glad . How can so little bread satisfy so much hunger ? CROW I 'm not hungry any more , either ! ( He turns and looks up at JACK ADAMS , wondering about him and the bread ) DANDY ( His voice calm and joyous now ) Gibbon , eat of the good bread and pass it along . A piece of it has satisfied the fiercest hunger I have ever known . Eat of it , Gibbon ! GIBBON ( His face glowing like the face of a saint ) I take my share ! ( He breaks off a share and puts it into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Maharajah , the Oracle , the Merchant of Ice Cream ) p. 92 MAHARAJAH In the days of plenty , I gave you none of my goods : secrets , forecasts , or ice cream . Now I am a bankrupt merchant . Though hungry , I have no share in this bread ! ( To TOMMY SINGH ) Soldier , take the loaf . DANDY No , no , everyone must have a share of this loaf . The poet in jail gave the loaf to one man  --  Fishkin  --  whose right it was to eat it all and be well-fed but not immortal . Fishkin remembered our hunger and passed the loaf to us . Jim took his share and I took mine and Gibbon his , and we are hungry no longer . Indian , you have dealt in secrets and such . Here is no secret . Who does not take his share of that loaf deprives Fishkin of his just immortality  --  Jim of his , Gibbon of his , and I of mine . Give us our immortality , Indian ! Share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon ) Fishkin  --  old man  --  all of you  --  your kindness wounds me , and I am ashamed ! I take my share ! Henceforth my secrets are free . ( He breaks off a piece of the loaf and puts it in his mouth ) Soldier , take your share . SINGH I am a soldier of the Empire , and the jail I guard is part of the Empire . The prisoner in the jail is prisoner of the Empire , and my duty is to hold him fast . He is my prisoner . He is the King 's prisoner . ( He tries to stand very straight ) I salute my King ! I can not share the prisoner 's bread with you ! ( He falls in a faint . THE MAHARAJAH catches him . JIM DANDY gets out of his chair and hurries to him ) p. 93 DANDY The man 's starved ! ( He helps THE MAHARAJAH hold him up ) Gibbon , a hand , please ! ( To THE MAHARAJAH ) Hold the loaf  --  do not pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that GIBBON can hold the soldier up ) Water , Jim ! ( JIM DANDY and GIBBON move TOMMY SINGH to Jim Dandy 's chair and prop him up in it , as JIM CROW comes with a cup of water . TOMMY SINGH opens his eyes ) You 're among friends . SINGH I am a soldier of His Majesty 's Empire ! DANDY ( Taking the cup from JIM CROW ) Here ! Drink this ! ( TOMMY SINGH drinks ) SINGH Thank you . I 'll take my post now . ( He tries to get up , but falls back into the chair ) DANDY Rest now a moment . SINGH ( Fiercely , almost sobbing , whispering ) I ca n't stand ! Oh , bloody , bloody ! DANDY You 're hungry , man . SINGH ( Whispering with terrible anguish ) I 'll have none of your bread ! ( Shouting ) Get away from me ! Have you never seen a dying man ? p. 94 DANDY You need n't die , soldier , and you need n't have the bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you ! with your love and brotherhood ! To hell with your bread ! ( He tries to stand but ca n't . He shouts fiercely ) Long live the King ! DANDY Long live the King ! EVERYBODY Long live the King ! SINGH Why do you mock me ? DANDY We do not mock . Long live the King . SINGH My King ? DANDY Yes , your King . SINGH You mock me ! DANDY No , we do not mock . We say long live the King . You are the King . SINGH ( Bitterly , fiercely ) To hell with all of you , to mock a dying man ! A sorry King I am , unable to stand on my own two feet . I 'm no King and you need n't wish me long life . If I die now , or tomorrow , or a hundred years from now , it 's all the same . DANDY And so it is if I die , or any of us who by the grace of God draw breath and stir about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier of the Empire ! You are free , man of Asia ! You are free , brother ! p. 95 SINGH Go to hell , I do n't want to be free ! I do n't need to be free . I want to serve my King ! DANDY ( Gently ) When you are able to stand again , employ your freedom as you will or must . You are free to be unfree . You are free to reject love and friendship . You are free to reject the bread of the common loaf . You are among men who cherish freedom and you shall not be deprived of yours , though your employment of it deprive us of some of ours . ( The light begins to increase gradually ) SINGH ( Whispering ) God forgive me , I want my freedom ! I want the bread , and need it ! ( Shouting suddenly ) Give me the loaf and let me take my share ! I have an allegiance to His Majesty 's Empire , but I should be traitor to that Empire if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty is man ! Let me eat and be restored ! ( THE MAHARAJAH hands him the loaf . He tears a portion out of it and chews and swallows . He stands suddenly ) Long live  --  Long live His Majesty man ! Long live the common loaf ! Long live the eaters of the common loaf ! ( Cheers and gladness ) I 've got my legs again . I am restored now . I know my way . I thank you for your kindness . Here 's the loaf . Who 's next ? p. 96 DANDY ( Of the runaway girl ) Let our sister eat of it . TOMMY SINGH hands the runaway girl the loaf . She takes a piece out of it and puts it into her mouth and hands the loaf to JOHNNY . He takes a piece out of it and hands it to JOCK , who takes a piece out of it and hands it to MOLLY . She takes a piece out of it and hands it to LITTLE JOHNNY . He takes a piece out of it and runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the loaf to her , all of which happens like a joyous dance . The little girl takes a piece out of it and eats it , and everybody is glad and alive , but hushed by the miracle . JIM DANDY gets out of his chair and strolls about , deep in thought , while everyone watches him . He stops and thinks , taps and waves his stick , moves on , stops and broods . Suddenly he turns to the old man in jail and speaks to him softly . DANDY As you see , your loaf has fed us all and set us free . Each of us has had his share . Each of us is no longer hungry , and yet the loaf is still there . I did not believe it would go around , but look for yourself  --  the child has eaten her share , yet holds a portion still . What does that mean , except that you who gave us the bread , must have your share ? Sir , you must have your share here with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . ( The light is the full light of noon again ) p. 97 EVERYBODY Yes , we must set you free ! DANDY Soldier of the Empire ! Jim ! Gibbon ! Fishkin ! His Majesty man ! Move the stairway to the prison window and let me set the prisoner free ! ( Murmurs of surprise ) Oh , yes , I would do it alone , if I may . Though fat and soft , there is special power in me still . Enough , I think , to wrench that frame of rusted steel from that old brick , but if I fail  --  well , you will help me . Hurry ! The stairway is pushed directly under the prison window , and JIM DANDY climbs the stairway to the platform . He clutches two of the steel bars to test the frame , then begins to shake the frame loose , while everyone watches . After a moment the frame is quite loose . JIM DANDY braces himself and tugs until very slowly the whole frame comes out , as everyone murmurs with amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame from JIM DANDY , and goes down the stairway with it , while JIM DANDY helps the old man out of the jail and onto the platform . JIM DANDY and JACK ADAMS come down the stairway , arm in arm , while everyone watches in silence . JIM CROW and GIBBON push the stairway away from the jail window . JIM DANDY and JACK ADAMS take the center of the stage . There are tears in the eyes of both men , and both of them are trembling with emotion . Everybody gathers around the two men , who suddenly stand apart and look at one another , then embrace . p. 98 ADAMS ( His voice shaking ) Freedom is sweet , but how sweet is this freedom !  --  sweetest of all  --  for free men broke the untrue law to give it to me . No longer can I feel that I have lived for nothing . You 've given me freedom and something more  --  the best health I 've ever had  --  oh , if I 'd only had it from the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 've rescued me from the sickness of yesterday and the madness of today , and you 've carried me into the health of tomorrow . You 've given me back my right to the happy death I 've worked for all my life . This freedom will be short but everlasting . Now the cluttered clock instead of keeping time gives it away . Now time is ours at last . We can no longer lose or waste it , since we are free and in love with God and one another . To begin is pleasure now , to begone is joy . I shall begone before you know it , but I shall go with tender kisses . We are together now . Now , all things are together again . We are free and we have the best of health . Let us rejoice in our freedom , let us rejoice in our health . I know each of you understands . I love you all , and want to shake your hands ! ( He extends his hand to JIM DANDY , and they press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble man . ( He extends his hand to FISHKIN ) Fishkin , you are truly famous ! ( He embraces FISHKIN lightly . He extends his hand to TOMMY SINGH ) Soldier of the Empire , I salute you , for your struggle was a bitter one . Your triumph was both freedom and imprisonment for me . Behold , the willing prisoner of your heart ! ( He embraces TOMMY SINGH lightly . He extends his hand to JIM CROW ) Last night , my son , you smoked a cigarette and told of memories you never had  --  memories of friends ! Now , at last , your memories are true , all men are friends ! ( He embraces JIM CROW lightly . He extends his hand to GIBBON ) Gibbon , I 'm old enough to be your father , so let me be , and embrace you . ( He embraces GIBBON lightly . He extends his hand to JOHNNY ) Spread this freedom and health . ( Embracing LITTLE JOHNNY ) And let this man spread it after you . ( Shaking hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Shaking hands with THE MAHARAJAH and embracing him ) God bless you , bankrupt merchant . God bless your secrets and ice cream . God bless your drums and flutes and tambourines . ( He turns to MOLLY , smiling at her ) Lovely girl , your dancing is our noblest poetry . ( MOLLY throws herself into his arms for a swift embrace . He turns to the runaway girl and stares at her , his face beaming with love ) You have been weary , child , and homeless . Last night I heard you weep as you slept , and your weeping gave me back the hope I 'd lost . Perhaps you did not know you wept for me . Your weeping 's been our therapy . Now stay with us and be at home . ( The runaway girl embraces him . He turns to the girl of the cave and whispers ) Sweet , sweet and patient ! Sweet mother and child ! Sweet sister and daughter ! ( The girl moves to him shyly , holding the bread out to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece and puts it into his mouth and chews and swallows as he speaks ) Ah , yes , the bread ! Let me kiss the hands that kept my share for me ! ( He kisses the child 's hands . The girl embraces him and kisses his brow . He leaps to his full height ) Oh , this is better heaven than I had ever dreamed could be . ( FLORA comes in through the swinging doors . LITTLE JOHNNY leaps down from the counter and runs to her . Everyone turns to FLORA and LITTLE JOHNNY ) p. 99 LITTLE JOHNNY Mama , Mama , you 're just in time ! It 's tomorrow at last , and we 're giving a play ! Fishkin made us laugh ! And cry ! Gibbon told us who we are . We 've all eaten of the common loaf , which the old man in jail gave to Fishkin , and Fishkin to us . We 've done the most wonderful things , but best of all was Jim Dandy setting the old man free ! Mama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You must shake the old man 's hand , too . FLORA The place is changed . There 's something in the faces I never saw when I was here . ( To JOHNNY ) What 's happened in the public library ? JOHNNY ( Putting his arm around her ) Freedom and health , fun and love . The Holy Grail is being revealed . Take your share of the bread , then sit beside me and let us see the end of the play . They go to JACK ADAMS who hands FLORA the last piece of the bread . Bewildered , she looks at everyone , puts the bread in her mouth , chews and swallows it , then embraces the old man . FLORA , JOHNNY and LITTLE JOHNNY go to the counter and sit together on it . DANDY ( To JACK ADAMS ) Come , sir ! Sit down and be at ease . ADAMS Yes , let the play go on . I 've lived well , and I 've only a moment longer . Hurry , so I shall not miss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Fishkin , will you take the stage again ? p. 100 LITTLE JOHNNY Fishkin , Mama ! Now listen to Fishkin ! FISHKIN Ahkhp , it would n't help ! I 'm foolish again . I 'm Fishkin again . I tell myself again and again , Drop dead , Fishkin , drop dead ! LITTLE JOHNNY More , more ! You 've told us about flowers and snow , Fishkin . Now tell us about other things . FISHKIN It would n't help . LITTLE JOHNNY It would , it would ! Tell us about rain , Fishkin . FISHKIN Rain , rain , go away , come again another day . I 'm foolish now . I 'm Fishkin again . LITTLE JOHNNY ( Almost with panic ) No , no , Fishkin ! Tell us , tell us ! What does the rain do ? FISHKIN Ahkhp ! It 's too easy . The rain cries . It floods the streets with tears . The gutters run with the torrent of its tears . LITTLE JOHNNY ( Entranced and almost broken-hearted ) Why does the rain cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat grow , so everybody can have bread . The rain cries to make the grapes grow , so everybody can have wine . ( Solemnly , a little tired of himself ) The rain cries to make the flowers grow , so everybody can see beauty . ( He stops ) The rain cries to clean the streets . ( He is in despair . He whispers now ) The rain cries because  --  ( He stops again , looking around at everybody . He goes to JACK ADAMS and stands before him ) p. 101 ADAMS Yes , my boy ? FISHKIN ( As the light gradually grows dim again ) My father never knew the fool he bungled forth . My mother surely thought I 'd be a wonderful man . And I never knew until this very instant how wrong I 've been to hate my father , and my mother , and myself  --  and all the sons of all the fathers and all the mothers . I said to myself from boy- hood on , What a trick it was to put me in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a trick it was to give me this Fishkin face , these Fishkin eyes . ( Pause ) I never knew until this very instant that it was not my mother and my father who brought me forth . I never knew until this very instant that I did not come here Fishkin ! I came here any man , to act my part , to create my role , to be whomsoever I should choose to be . How wrong , how wrong to learn so simple a thing so late . I came to act or be acted upon , but until this very instant I was only acted upon , and most fantastically . Each play upon the Fishkin stage gave me greater loathing of myself . I knew nothing but sickly self-analysis and fidgeting despair . Good God , I never knew we are not born of present flesh ! Or surely not of that alone ! We are here , each of us , in the number of two thousand millions , to give us better odds to act , and acting set ourselves free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man once asked , To be or not to be ? But the very asking was the answer . To ask to be or not to be is to be acted upon , and not to be ! His question answered him . He was acted upon . And the rain cries because we are acted upon , and therefore nearly nothing . Or only dead men who wait for burial , or suicides who hurry to it from anxiety and disgust . The rain cries because our best acting comes out of being acted upon , as falling down comes from being pierced by a sword  --  but where 's the art of such acting ? Where 's the creation and religion of it ? The rain cries because we do not truly act , and might if we could only find the stage for it , and the play . The rain cries because our acting is without life , against life , and for death ! Because our acting is without art , creation , or religion . The tears of a whole nation of noble men would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must weep for our poor stage and play and performance . The rain cries for each of us , for the failure of each of us . ( Suddenly , brightly , turning to LITTLE JOHNNY ) Lord Johnny , the rain cries with joy because I am your father ! ( Of others , including JOHNNY ) And he is your father . And he . And he . ( Of FLORA , and MOLLY , and the runaway girl , and the girl of the cave ) And she is your mother , and my wife . And she , and she , and she . And the rain cries with joy , Lord Johnny , because you are the father of all of us . ( Of the girl of the cave ) And she the mother . That is more nearly something like the truth than anything I have ever thought or said or believed or dreamed before . Father , shake hands with your son ! p. 102 LITTLE JOHNNY ( Shaking hands ) Hah hah hah ! Fishkin 's my son ! You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISHKIN Somebody sing ! Somebody dance ! For Fishkin is born at last , and this time he 's glad he 's here ! This world 's no orphanage , no asylum for the mad , no hospital for the sick , no penitentiary for the criminal . This world 's home and we are the lucky tenants of the house . Fishkin is born ! Somebody sing ! ARIMATHEA ( Watching JACK ADAMS whose breathing is now the breathing of a dying man . His voice desperately loud and alive ) Who 'll sing ? ( Slight pause , almost frantically , his voice falling ) I 'll sing ! ( Aside , whispering ) His time 's so short , and yet I ca n't remember one song . Not one ! ( Suddenly , desperately , very little music in his voice ) Papa 's broken jail ! Mama 's jumped her bail ! Baby , in the rose-garden , Sings  --  ( He goes to JACK ADAMS , while everybody watches . The old man is trying hard to breathe . JOCK whispers the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans over the old man , then turns to the others , speaking desperately ) Somebody sing ! The little girl runs to the cave and stands in it , looking out , as timid and fearful as an animal again . JIM CROW tries to sing Careless Love , but there is little music in his voice , either . Suddenly , as JIM CROW falters and almost stops , the clear voice of JIM SMITHER , the young prisoner who was hanged , is heard , picking up the song where JIM CROW faltered . Everybody listens with amazement and relief and JACK ADAMS breathes easier . p. 103 ADAMS ( Standing ) I 've won my war ! This is the happy death I 've waited for . ( Whispering as he smiles ) It was good to have passed this way . ( He looks about ) Good-bye , my friends ! ( He sees the little girl standing in the cave ) Come , child , and take my hand ! The cave 's no longer your home ! Come , take me to the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , and together they go to the cave . JACK ADAMS kneels and the girl throws herself into his arms and kisses him . He points to JOCK and pushes her toward him . She runs to JOCK , who takes her up in his arms . JACK ADAMS waves good-bye and everybody waves back at him ) Sing ! Sing and dance ! Be glad ! We 're born at last ! He steps into the cave and disappears , as the voice of JIM SMITHER comes closer , and the revolving door whirls swiftly , by itself , and stops , its bells and glass ringing and tinkling . JIM CROW sings with his old friend JIM SMITHER , and then THE MAHARAJAH and TOMMY SINGH join in . FISHKIN suddenly joins the singing , too . JOCK and MOLLY begin an old-time vaudeville exit shuffle across the stage . JIM DANDY takes his chair . JIM CROW stands a little behind JIM DANDY . Everyone else joins the exit shuffle . First in the procession is MOLLY who now holds the girl of the cave by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A foot or two behind JOCK and MOLLY is the second group : LITTLE JOHNNY , FLORA , and JOHNNY . Behind this group is the runaway girl and TOMMY SINGH . Next is GIBBON and THE MAHARAJAH . And last , alone but no longer in despair , is FISHKIN . The swinging doors are latched back , so that they remain open , and as the people reach the passageway they turn and wave to JIM DANDY and JIM CROW . The song ends and there is darkness and silence all about . JIM CROW kneels in front of JIM DANDY , who touches him with his stick . JIM CROW stands . p. 104 DANDY Blow the horn , Jim ! JIM CROW plays a high , clear , solemn yet joyous call on the bugle . As he does so the scene gradually fills with light , and the rose-tree is seen to be covered with roses . In the window of the jail is Jim Crow 's talisman , enormously enlarged and very bright , surrounded by the violet , daisy , sun-flower , lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheaves of wheat . Beyond the talisman rain is falling heavily . The interior of the cave is now full of light , in which is seen the disengaged stairway , standing in falling snow . Jim Crow 's eyes are more than half-closed when he plays the bugle . When he stops playing and looks around , he is amazed and delighted . He points to the window of the jail , to the cave , and to the rose-tree , but JIM DANDY has already seen it all . JIM DANDY gets up and strolls to the rose-tree , followed by JIM CROW . JIM DANDY plucks a rose and puts it in Jim Crow 's lapel , then plucks another for his lapel . DANDY Jim , sit in my chair , please . CROW ( Sitting ) Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy . JIM DANDY goes to the water jar and fills two paper cups full of water , returns to JIM CROW and hands one to him . They touch cups and lift them . DANDY To His Majesty man ! p. 105 CROW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROW ( Humbly ) Yes , sir . ( They sip from their cups , then JIM DANDY pours the contents of his cup onto the floor , and the fluid is red . JIM CROW stands . ) To you , Mr. Jim Dandy ! ( He sips some more of the contents of his cup , then pours the rest of it onto the floor , and again the fluid is red . Delighted ) Yes , sir , Mr. Jim Dandy ! No man , no man is out of that majesty ! Not even Jim Crow ! He steps down from the platform and looks up at the talisman in the jail window , and listens to the falling rain . JIM DANDY strolls to the cash register , presses down on a key and the machine goes through its old rigmarole of honking and groaning and shifting , but this time the rigmarole is louder and more prolonged than ever . At last the drawer comes out , and out of it leap and fall hundreds of coins , as if from a fountain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JIM CROW is amazed . JIM DANDY idly pushes a row of books off a shelf onto the floor , then takes the center of the stage . Now , JIM CROW is staring inside the cave . JIM DANDY straightens himself up vigorously , takes a firm hold on his stick , and then presses the cricket : clickety-clack ! JIM CROW leaps to his side and takes his arm . p. 106 DANDY Alif , ba , ta ! Ha , waw , ya ! ( As they march off together very swiftly and smartly ) **26;2437;TOOLONG ! Tra la , la la , la la ! The bells of the church peal out as the curtain comes down very swiftly .
