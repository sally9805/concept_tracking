txt Calling this " the Survival War , " President Roosevelt declared today that it would take two or three years to make certain that our type of civilization would be saved . He added : " We are going to come out the winner in the long run . " Beset by many problems , the President appeared more worn today than he has for some time , but he confidently told the Governing Board of the Pan-American Union at the Whine House that " we are going places . " The occasion of his remarks to the Ambassadors and Ministers of Latin - American countries was Pan-American Day . He expressed his hope that substantial unanimity among the nations of this hemisphere would continue , and emphasized again the danger from Hitler 's Germany which threatens all . He pledged that the American nations will have a very great voice in planning the peace . PRESIDENT 'S REMARKS The stenographic record of Mr. Roosevelt 's remarks follows : " Do not let us be formal . We are not having any formalities today , because whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare it , and I have no spare weeks at the present time . " I think it is a fine thing that again we are celebrating PanAmerican Day . I hope that we are celebrating it in every republic , because I think it has more significance this year than at any pre- vious time in the history of the hemisphere . " I know that some of you have ? one or two of you have  --  certain problems back home . And I do think that the idea is being understood more than ever before what would happen if any part of any of the hemisphere were dominated by a successful Germany . " We would n't live the same kind of lives  --  that is the easiest way of putting it . Because that new  --  not the old German civilization  --  that new German civilization is so totally different from what all of us have been accustomed to since we were born . I shudder to think of what would happen to any part of the hemisphere that came under German domination . " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper men a little while ago ? I want a name for the war . I have n't had any very good suggestions . Most of them are too long . " My own thought is that perhaps there is one word that we could use for this war , the word " survival " The Survival War . That is , it comes pretty close to being the survival of our civilization , the survival of democracy , the survival of a hemisphere  --  the newest hemisphere of all of them ? which has developed in its own ways . " On the surface these ways may be a bit different , but down at the bottom there is the same kind of civilization that has come from a love of liberty and the willingness to pioneer . So I think that survival is what our problem is , survival of what we have all lived for for a great many generations . " I think in all of the republics we have , relatively speaking , quite an ancient civilization  --  reckoned since we have had independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why I hope that continental hemispheric solidarity and unanimity are going to continue . At the last Pan American Conference of the hemisphere down at Rio  --  while some people felt it had not gone so far as it would like to go ? we did manage to retain the objective of unanimity . " There may be other problems after the war that we will have to work out among ourselves , sitting around the table , but at the present time we have substantial unanimity . That is a great thorn in the flesh of Herr Hitler . He felt that the success of the Rio conference was a very serious blow to the Axis ' efforts to dominate the world . " . And so I hope that we will go ? on as we have in the past . A few of you were here at the time ? in the Summer of 1933 , after I had been in here for a few months ? we had a bit of trouble in the Republic of Cuba . " I asked all of the Ambassadors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the table in an informal way . And I told them that I did n't want the United States to do anything without everybody knowing all about it , and that my thought was that it was a problem for Cuba to decide for herself . Cuba did , and many old-fashioned commentators in this country said it was a terrible thing to let Cuba handle the affairs of Cuba . " So I hope we will continue to have the unanimity of the past . And when it comes to cleaning up the mess at the end of this war , after the Axis is defeated , we will have again an Hemispheric Council around here to see what we are going to do all over the world , because we will have a very great voice in preventing , in the future , an attack on our American civilization . " I have n't prepared any speech . These are just some thoughts that come to me every day  --  day and night " We are going places . We will get somewhere . A.nd we are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before we can make sure that our type of civilization is going to survive . I am perfectly confident of it myself . We have all got to sacrifice . But we are going to come out the winner in the long run . " It is good to see you all , and I hope that next year we will be in an even better state than we are in 1942 . Good luck to you . " In his subsequent press conference , President Roosevelt said that he had not yet definitely accepted the term " Survival War " as official for the current conflict , but remarked that he had suggested the title and representatives of the American republics had liked it . Wallace Asks United Effort Vice President Wallace participated in the celebration of the day by an address in Spanish which was recorded and broadcast over the three international stations of the Columbia Broadcasting System . His remarks were read in English over the CBS network by Edward Arnold . Mr. Wallace said that it is now imperative that " we should crystalize the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to root out the soil of global aggression . " " Pan-Americanism is a concept so sacred that it is worth fighting for , " he continued . " Only through Pan-Americanism may the common man of city and country achieve the spiritual dignity and the material well-being dignity are the inalienable rights of mankind . "
