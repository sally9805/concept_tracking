DDT , the wonder insecticide , may be a blessing ? but can be a curse . Properly used , it can eliminate many insect-borne diseases . Scattered broadcast over field and forest it may harm our fish and wild life , kill the helpful insects essential to agriculture , and even damage the crops themselves . What is worse , recent research shows that overuse of DDT may directly harm man . We now know that DDT goes into the butter and cream of animals eating fodder sprayed with the poison ? and if too much is used , the concentration is dangerously high for humans . These dangers result from two special characteristics of DDT . It is selective in the way it kills . And it keeps on killing for months . The first effect of DDT on a housefly is to make him very nervous ? not because he knows what is ahead for him , but because DDT kills in a different way . It attacks the nervous system , very much as strychnine affects a man . When DDT dissolved in kerosene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white crystals . The surface is  | so covered that an insect can not walk over it without treading on a crystal . A single contact is lethal to such susceptible insects as flies , mosquitoes , and bedbugs . The foot of a fly is particularly vulnerable because of its extremely efficient sense organs . The skeleton ( the outside of a fly ) is thin at points near the ends of the joints . In addition , there are sensory hairs , longer and finer than other hairs . In fact , the whole bottom of a fly 's foot is so sensitive that death is almost certain when a DDT crystal lodges in any of the many hairs that form the sole . The nerves react quickly . The fly rubs its legs together or rubs them over the wings , crawls about rapidly , and picks up more crystals . Inside the affected foot , the nerve swells slightly . Nerve lesions then are formed in various parts of the body and eventually in the central nerve mass of the thorax ? the part of the fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . The poison is also effective when a droplet hits the fly 's breathing pores or other sensory areas . The insect may die , too , from eating food containing DDT . Unless the poison passes ' through the digestive system very quickly , post-mortem examination will reveal the same nerve lesions as though the fly had walked on DDT . Few insects have as sensitive and vulnerable feet as the housefly . Beetles are protected by an armored external skeleton , and DDT touching the wing covers or other impervious parts has no effect . The cockroach has a highly polished outer covering to which foreign matter does not adhere . The caterpillars of moths and butterflies , and the larvae of most insects , have a very thin skeleton and are much more susceptible . Some insects with a thin skeleton , however , such as the silverfish and firebrats , are protected by a silky fleece that repels even an oily spray . These differences in insects explain variations in the effectiveness of DDT . Not even all flies are potential victims . The tough feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy dose to kill the bluebottles and green-bottles . The services , for example , found DDT rather ineffective in controlling Chrysomyia , the green-bottle fly that carries dysentery and jaundice . Despite reports that all of the harmful insects were wiped out on some Pacific islands , the hard-to-kill insects were not destroyed on any island . The general rule for determining the effectiveness of DDT is : The larger the insect or the harder its outer skeleton , the more resistant ; the smaller or more delicate , the more susceptible . Many of the most vulnerable insects are valuable to man ? in fact , it is doubtful if mankind could survive without them . Some flies , for example , furnish food for fish ; some are parasites of insect pests or feed upon them , and others pollinate flowers . These friendly types are the most easily killed by DDT . The same is true of another great order of insects , the Hymenoptera , which includes bees , wasps , and ants . Some of them , such as the sawflies and certain ants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from DDT . Experiments in Ontario by the Dept. of Lands and Forests show what happens when DDT is used out of doors . Damage to trees was limited to burning of leaf edges . Carnivorous water beetles and some other aquatic insects were not greatly affected but died because the insects on which they fed were destroyed . Other aquatic insects were killed directly . Crayfish , which feed on insects and themselves serve as fish food , were very susceptible . Minnows were killed by contact and trout died from eating poisoned insects . Six kinds of frogs and two kinds of snakes were killed , either by contact or by eating poisoned insects . Any DDT field spray is likely to destroy more than half of these amphibians . The susceptibility of fish and amphibians makes spreading DDT on or near water dangerous . Experiments have shown that one pound of DDT per acre will kill the larvae of Anopheles ( malarial ) mosquitoes. which feed on the surface . The dose must be considerably increased , however , to kill other larvae . Then , other kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part of DDT to 10,000,000 parts of water will destroy most fish . Unfortunately , once DDT has been deposited , it is out of control , and even a light spray for Anopheles may be concentrated in one end of a pond by wind and waves and destroy all the cold-blooded animals in the area . If a dust is used , this may be blown from foliage and concentrated similarly . At Bear Mountain Park in New York we found that plain kerosene was as deadly to mosquito wrigglers as a DDT solution ? and did not kill the amphibians . A further objection to the wide use of DDT in larvae control is the danger of contaminating the water supply . Fear of this led us to abandon plans to use DDT extensively outdoors at Bear Mountain Park . Heavy rains might wash the DDT into reservoirs . We were not fully aware of the deadly effects of the chemical then , but we received word from Okinawa later that several natives had died from eating DDT. and post-mortem examination revealed nerve lesions similar to those produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear that  | widespread use of DDT out of doors may have far-reaching effects . The impact upon the fish population , for example , goes beyond the losses from direct poisoning and feeding upon poisoned insects . The millions of midges that live near water are fish food and also feed aquatic insects such as stone flies and diving beetles , which are another part of the fish diet . The midges are particularly vulnerable to DDT . When they die , the aquatic insects starve . And when both midges and aquatic bugs disappear , fish perish . The same chain reaction hits birds . They apparently are not killed by eating insects poisoned by dosages of less than one pound of DDT per acre , although larger dosages are likely to destroy them . But destruction of the bird 's food supply ? the caterpillars , flies , and larvae that are the first victims of DDT ? by weekly dustings or sprayings would raise havoc with our song and game birds . When man brashly tampers with the balance of nature , more harm than good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of their charges through ordinary orchard sprays , fear DDT may be the final blow . Without insects , there will be no pollination ; without pollination , there will be no seed ; without seed , there will be no plants . DDT 's effects on insects may not be noticed for several days or even weeks , so the user may repeat the treatment with a solution or dust two or three times as strong . Most authorities agree that one pound per  | acre , or 20 gallons , is the largest amount that can be safely used . This is a very small dosage and the man accustomed to using four or five times as much insecticide will be strongly tempted to overdo it . The DDT might then kill people , because recent experiments have shown that it tends to concentrate in the milk of animals fed on DDTtreated food . In the face of these dangers , some proponents of DDT are strangely nonchalant . The statement of the extension service of a New England state that " there is no reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other common insecticides when used in the same manner " overlooks the staying power of DDT . Whereas other insecticides are effective only right after application , DDT keeps on killing bugs for weeks or even months after it is applied . DDT belongs in the home , in my opinion . Within four walls , it can be controlled . Used extensively , DDT may well eliminate malaria and dengue from the United States . Both of these diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes , which become infected by biting diseased persons . Fortunately , both ailments take a week to develop inside the mosquito and during this time the insect can not transmit the disease . If we can kill the pest in that week , we can halt the infection . DDT will do this . Sprayed on the dark portions of rooms , under desks and chairs , and , better still , on all the walls , DDT picks off the adult mosquito , frequently before it has a chance to bite . Since mosquitoes usually remain it a house for several days , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled houseflies in buildings merely by saturating lamp pulls and spraying hanging light fixtures . Additional protection can be given by spraying walls and ceilings , particularly where flies light . A single treatment is usually enough around the house , but two or three applications a season may be required in stables or dairy barns . Application of DDT to walls and surfaces is much preferred to general spraying . The aerosol bomb has the additional disadvantage of leaving fine particles of DDT floating around a room for several hours , during which they may be inhaled . If the bombs are used , the rooms should be aired for a considerable time before being occupied . For application to walls , DDT dissolved in kerosene is much more effective than water solutions . DDT 's value against carpet beetles is extremely doubtful at present . Silverfish and adult clothes moths are killed only when the application is fresh . There is no evidence that it kills moth larvae except by direct contact . In my own tests , both silverfish and cockroaches greatly increased in numbers even when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found DDT effective against dog ticks . Housewives who believe reports that DDT kills quickly will be disappointed . Killing mosquitoes may take more than 10 hours , and houseflies more than 24 hours . Bedbugs usually expire in from one to five hours . Within its limitations . however , DDT is one of the most amazing insecticides known .  |
