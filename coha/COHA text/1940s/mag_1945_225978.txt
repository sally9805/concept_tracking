The first and most significant crisis of the San Francisco conference appeared the second day . It arose in the steering committee , when Anthony Eden moved that Ed Stettinius be made permanent chairman of the conference . Molotov objected : he said that a presidium of the four sponsoring powers should rotate among themselves the chairmanships of the plenary sessions and of the most important committees . <P> At the time , Molotov 's proposal was widely misinterpreted as sheer rudeness . Even Stettinius and Eden opposed it on the wrong grounds : they simply thought that it would snarl up the whole conference procedure . Not until later did Molotov 's opponents realize that in forcing him to back down-as he did-they had won the opening round in a long battle for free discussion . <P> Though they produce able disputants , the Russians do not really believe in discussion . The Big Four were the boss , they reasoned , and the way to recognize that fact was by a Big Four presidium which would confine effective discussion to the controlling powers . The Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ed Stettinius , Senator Vandenberg and such little-nation spokesmen as Australia 's Herbert V. Evatt , they never won . <P> Freedom of discussion was at the heart of the veto issue . The Russians wanted to interpret the veto so that one power could shut off discussion even in the Security Council . At this point Stettinius took his stand and saved the conference . He told Molotov , in a formal note , that the U.S. would sooner have no charter at all than one with this restriction . Meanwhile , Harry Hopkins in Moscow put it up to Stalin . The Russians gave in . <P> Again , when the Russians wanted to limit the subjects the General Assembly could discuss , Moscow was notified that if the U.S.S.R. did not back down by noon the next day ( June 19 ) it would be outvoted on the floor of the conference . Promptly at noon , Soviet Chairman Andrei Gromyko backed down . <P> In their own way , and in their own interest , the U.S. and Britain were as jealous of Big Power prerogatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a presidium but a U.S. institution , the smoke-filled room , preserved Big Power unity . San Francisco 's smoky room was the parlor of Stettinius ' suite atop the Fairmont Hotel , where the Big Power representatives were in almost daily session . <P> " Gawd Bless You All ! " The fight on Monday , April 30 , over the admission of authoritarian Argentina was another real crisis . Molotov saw his chance and took it ; the U.S. , having made the Latin countries support the earlier admission of Russia 's Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics , was committed to bring Argentina in , too . Although the Russians were roundly beaten on the vote , they looked as happy as a tiger that had swallowed a young parrot . They had a moral issue that they could use forever after . <P> That was the worst day . The best day was May 3 . Then the Big Four announced the amendments they had agreed upon . These 22 amendments contained , the seedlings of San Francisco 's main improvements over Dumbarton Oaks ( see above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 3 the conference turned the corner .
