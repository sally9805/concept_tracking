All through the weekend the U.S. people wondered : Will there be another railroad strike ? The memory of the last one - in 1946-was still green . <P> Hour after hour , the President 's labor adviser , John Steelman , sweated through negotiations at the White House with management and labor . They came to nothing . This week , 18 hours before the strike deadline , Harry Truman seized the roads to prevent " a nationwide tragedy . " He put Secretary of the Army Royall in charge of the railways , ordered the Army to operate them . Then he gave the three stubborn brotherhoods-the engineers , firemen and switchmen-until 5 o'clock that afternoon to call off the strike . <P> The brotherhood bosses still refused to comply , apparently determined to make it clear that they would not give in until they were forced . Groups of grim men raced between Government buildings . Newsmen cornered Grand Chief Engineer Alvanley Johnston and demanded to know whether he would call off the strike if enjoined . Snapped Johnston : " Why ask such a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A Matter of Minutes . Royall summoned Johnston and his colleagues , the firemen 's David Robertson and the switchmen 's A. J. Glover , to a last-minute conference at the Pentagon . It , too , was fruitless . Five o'clock passed and the strike order still stood . Then Royall and Assistant Attorney General H. Graham Morison hurried off to Federal Judge T. Alan Goldsborough , who had agreed to stand by in his chambers . Just three weeks ago , Judge Goldsborough had slapped fines of $1,420,000 on John L. Lewis and the U.M.W. It took him only a few minutes to issue a temporary order against the brotherhoods . Hours later the word went out to the nation 's railroaders to stay on their jobs . The trains still ran , under Army supervision . <P> But it had been a bad weekend for the nation . Most railroads had put an-embargo on shipment of perishables . Thousands of vegetable workers in California had already been laid off . Imminent freight and passenger-train cancellations spread confusion . The war of nerves touched virtually every citizen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath this week , the nation wondered : Was this kind of thing going to happen every few years ? Strikes in some indus tries could be endured . But a railway strike was unendurable . What had happened to the " model " Railway Labor Act of 1926 which was supposed to relieve the country of such crises ? * This was the fourth time since 1941 that the machinery of the act had collapsed . <P> The act was all right ; the trouble was with the behavior of some of the men who were covered by it . When the act 's apparatus did not get them what they wanted , the brotherhoods simply threw it away and threatened to use force . In 1941 , in 1943 , in 1946 and again this year , the brotherhood leaders had gone through the act 's elaborate process of negotiation , mediation , conciliation-and then rejected a presidential fact-finding board 's recommendations and set a strike date .
