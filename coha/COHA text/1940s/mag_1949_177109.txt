Dear Time-Reader <P> For Robert Low , TIME Inc. ' s Eastern European Correspondent , the last three and a half years of reporting the news from both sides of the Balkans ' gradually lowering Iron Curtain has been an excursion in incongruity . The Curtain is securely fastened now-except for Communist and fellow-traveling foreign journalists and Low has returned to the U.S. for a breather . <P> Low 's first-rate reporting job during his tour of duty is perhaps best exemplified by the now historic documents on the Tito-Stalin conflict , which ended in Moscow 's excommunication of Marshal Tito . Low managed to get them in advance of general publication and , as printed in TIME 'S August 23 , 1948 issue , they were the first complete summary of this revealing correspondence . Other Low stories that you may recall include his account of the Communist guerrilla raid on the Greek town of Naousa ( TIME , Jan. 31 ) , and Patriot George Magalios and the American aid program for Greece ( Jan. 3 ) . <P> Two anecdotes , among many , serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the news of Russia 's satellite Balkan countries . During arecent meeting with a Western-educated top official of one of the satellites , they talked in normal conversational idiom until Low asked a leading political question . The official said : " I 'll answer you , but from now on , you understand , I must use my own vocabulary . " Then he began : " As for the imperialist-fascist Western powers attempting to spread their poison within these freedom-loving democracies . . . " Says Low : " At that juncture you either abandon your line of questioning or go away , because you know the standard clichs as well as any Communist . " <P> On the other hand , neither ideology nor double-talk was involved in Low 's last successful attempt to get a reentry visa for Communist-controlled Rumania . Rumanian Premier Petru Groza would not see him and so , knowing that Groza fancied himself a tennis player second to no one , Low let it be known that back in the States he himself had been quite a tennist . Around midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to play ; his car would be around at 6 o'clock in the morning . <P> For the next three weeks Low was up at daybreak , banging away at the Premier - always with the same result . Groza , a wilful old man who had to win , brought his own umpire , a burly sergeant of the security police with an outsize Luger on his hip . If Low aced the Premier , he was " Not ready . Serve again . " If Groza 's return hit three feet outside the baseline , the sergeant would give Low a stern look , toggle his holster and grunt : " Goot ! " And no matter where Low 's ball hit , if the Premier could n't get it , it was always " oot ! " " Naturally , " says Low , " I did n't beat the Premier . No one does . But I got the re-entry visa , without which I could n't do my job . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
