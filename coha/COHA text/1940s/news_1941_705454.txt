txt Weapon Is One of Most Powerful Yet Developed in War 73y DAVE13 , ANDERSON Wireless to Tzar NSW " rotrx Tram , LONDON . March ** I blockade of her enemies curiously enough turns out to be one of the most powerful offensive weapons yet developed . by either side in this conflict , though the basic idea of siege is as old as war itself . Prior to the outbreak of hostilities a small group of British economists , checking up on Germany 's resources , saw wherein lay the best hope of depriving the Reich of its needs . What they had to work on was the record of the last war , in which the position of the Allies constituted close to the blockader 's paradise , yet even then the blockade was slow in producing telling results . It is admitted today that had the British in September , 1939 , foreseen present conditions they would have felt the matter of a blockade to be an almost hopeless proposition . Dictates Policy It might be an exaggeration to say the blockade administered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force and to the navy but it comes close to the truth . Besides cutting off supplies and drying up foreign credits the blockaders strike at enemies ' stocks the while Germany is Pressing borne a bitter war of attrition . Rather than accept the passive role given to it in 1914-18 , the British blockade is designed to drive Adolf Hitler into the offensive where the armed services can engage in combat . The longer this is postponed the more aggravating will he the cumulative effect of the shortages  --  oil , textiles , rubber , copPPr and nickel . These materials Germany must import . The first step in establishing the blockade when war was declared was the setting up of the contraband control committee . Soon it was seen the ships piled up in control stations to such an extent that the scheme was impracticable . A second step led to agreements with neutral nations which facilitated the passage of goods which they could guarantee would not be re-exported to Germany . Then followed rationing to a few neutrals , a solution hard to administer for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blockade are still used and the picture was broadened in December , 1939. by the introduction of navicerts  --  a sort of passport . flesponsibility on Exporter The Ministry of Economic Warfare was interested in the activities of ail neutral traders , their agents , their connections and the formal trade and potentialities of neutral countries as well as operations and organizations of German trade industry . The navicert system enabled the British to gain a firmer hold by transferring responsibility to the exporter instead of the importer . The navicert was regarded as a concession to traders who disliked not knowing whether the British would object to consignments and would detain them at some control base . When Germany overran France I and the Low Countries last Sum- ' , mer the blockade was knocked full of holes and the task of the British Navy became almost insurmountable . To meet this , the government 's economic advisers adopted a policy that warships must be only in waters where it was known definitely that there was something to be caught . To accomplish this it was ordered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis and the ships ' hulls themselves covered under separate licenses . Moreover passengers and mails were subjected to search in the same manner as cargo and ships ' papers . The blockade mechanism was made as nearly foolproof as British ingenuity could devise . Restrictions Tighter For a few months a number of ships sailed through the blockade net unhindered but last month none left port without permission where it was required . Trade between neutrals beyond European zones was unregulated . Rations were introduced for the remaining European neutrals and a strict blockade was enforced over enemy-occupied territory and exports to any part of the Continent were blanketed with a certificate of origin corresponding to ' the older navicerts . Two-thirds of the world 's total shipping tonnages are now sailing under the warrants scheme and more than half the rest of the tonnage consists of enemy vessels or those in enemy hands , and thus has been largely swept off the seas . Less than ane-sixth of the tonnage is left to operate regardless of Brit- I ish orders in the matter . Psychological Effect Apart from strategical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockade when the Germans get the feeling of defeat 11 through the lack of the necessities of life . Textiles are generally scarce , in Germany and the civilian ration now amounts to the equivalent of two suits a year  --  one overcoat would wipe out an individual 's purchasing power for twelve months . Hides and skins are also contributing to uneasiness within the Reich , not because of the lack of these materials but on account of the marked scarcity of the chemicals necessary for tanning the hides . Rubber has advanced beyond the luxury stage in modern civilization , cropping up as it does in innumerable household and industrial appliances , yet this too is now rare Indeed in the Nazi domain . A trivial detail may bring home its value better than would a mass figure ? children are forbidden to give lifts to their friends on tricycles or bicycles because that wears out tires . It would be wishful thinking on the part of the British to assume that the German armed forces are suffering these privations , because Berlin 's first job is to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortages will reach out beyond civilian life before long . Meanwhile the civilians will be that much worse off and presumably even more sick of it all . Copper has been substituted for aluminum just as buna has replaced rubber ? at a cost . Bauxite refining process for aluminum involves extravagant use of electricity , which means coal , and the same uneconomic condition applies to buna , of which only 50,000 tons were manufactured last year . Germany is calling in nickel coinage in all occupied lands , indicating stocks of this metal are not too plentiful . Other Nations Short The Reich is short of these and many other supplies  --  including oil , though the present rate of consumption leaves a wide margin for maintenance of the Luftwaffe  --  and those nations now dominated by Hitler are equally short . The transportation system is the weakest link since it . consumes fuel , metals and rubber while making negligible returns . The gravest breaches in the blockade , from the British point of view , are by way of Vladivostok , whence stream materials from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vichy from North Africa . Both of them are recognized as " ticklish problems . " As far as Russia is concerned London is mainly reliant on the good-will of the exporter since the interception of ships on the Pacific is more than the British Navy cares to guarantee . Washington has buoyed hopes of officials here by its swing in their direction and it is believed that Noel Hall , the new Minister heading to the United States , will strive to mend the loophole that Vladivostok provides . Unoccupied France was declared last June under full blockade but now the tendency is to ease restrictions . Publicity was given recently to the volume of trade flowing from North Africa to French Mediterranean ports and , it was presumed , flowing on into Germany . British opposition to food for Vichy hinges on the impression that edibles would be supplemented by trucks for hauling them plus similar related articles until the Nazis had driven a wedge into the blockade . German Results Germany 's efforts at the counterblockade of Britain are now yielding spectacular results in shipping losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the drive against the sea lanes opened early this month . Herr Hitler 's weapons , U-boats , bombers and surface raiders , have concentrated on the Atlantic approaches to these islands . There is nothing subtle nor farreaching geographically about this blockade though the results may have a direct hearing on the war 's outcome . It is an old-fashioned blockade in which an armed ring encircles the foe . Britain is convinced help from the United States must be forthcoming if that ring is to be smashed and Britain is to emerge victorious . For their part the British are confident that a world-wide blockade is more effective in the long run than the violent attacks currently being carried on by the enemy . American aid will be given in the form of ships and munitions while London can see little further hope for Germany making up her deficiencies . When asked whether the United States entry into the war would simplify the British blockade a well-Informed person replied : " Enormously . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
