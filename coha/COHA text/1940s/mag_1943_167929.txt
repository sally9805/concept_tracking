When the theater 's Alfred Lunt &; Lynn Fontanne took to the air last week , the result was added proof that radio acting is a specialized art , that great ability on the stage is no guarantee of a payoff before the microphone . For Russian War Relief ( WOR-Mutual ) and The Cavalcade of America ( NBC ) respectively the lusty pair played a Russian metalworker &; wife , a Bethlehem innkeeper &; wife . These roles were not designed to exploit the Lunts ' facility with bang and banter . Further , they were not favored by WOR-Mutual 's jerky dramatization of the life and death of Russia 's hero Nikolai Gastello , who dived into a German gasoline stock pile . The Lunts could not make Gastello 's parents even as convincing as the script made his act-which was not too convincing . <P> But the Lunts had a very good thing in Stephen Vincent Benet 's story of the Nativity for Cavalcade and they did better by it . Benet drew a parallel between the birthtime of Christ and World War II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters . Middle-aged Alfred Lunt kept the inn of the Nativity and spoke for all adaptable World War II innkeepers : <P> The country 's occupied . We have no <P> country . <P> You 've heard of that perhaps ? <P> You 've seen their soldiers , have n't you ? <P> You know Just what can happen to our sort of <P> people <P> Once there 's a little trouble ? . . . I 'm reasonable enough . I know the world . It 's a bad world but it must last our <P> time . <P> Herod is Herod but my inn 's my inn . I do the best I can . I pay my taxes , Here in this conquered and forsaken <P> land , <P> And , as for all your fine rebellious souls Who hide out in the hills and stir up <P> trouble ! <P> Call themselves prophets , too , and <P> prophesy That something new is coming to the <P> world , <P> The Lord knows what ! <P> Well , it 's a long time coming . <P> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . .
