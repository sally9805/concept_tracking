txt BRIDGES ACCUSES TRUMAN OF DECEIT IN ' PHONY ' AID PLAN Senator Also Says President Doctored ' Budget Figures to Keep the Total Down HE PROMISES AN INQUIRY Document Noted Discrepancy of $2,300,000,000 , Calling It a Necessary Margin By FELIX BELAIR Jr . Special to THE NEW Yont : Tams . WASHING'ilibN , Jan. 26 ? Charges that President Tillman sent Congress " a phony budget " ' on the European Recovery Program and " doctored " figures to suggest total Federal expenditures under $40,000,000,000 in fiscal 1949 were made today by Senator Styles Bridges , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee . The accusation came at a conference of Senate Republicans as critics of the Marshall Plan were crediting Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg with narrowing Congressional opposition to the program by his proposal for an independent administrative organization responsible only to the President . Citing the President 's budget request for $6,800,000,000 for Marshall Plan spending in fiscal 1949 , Senator Bridges charged that only $4,500,000,000 of the amount was accounted for by the Presidential estimates and demanded , " Where is that $2,300,000,000 evaporating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican pointed to $4,000,000,000 of projected Marshall Plan expenditures in the twelve months beginning July 1 and $500,000,000 of supplementary foreign aid asked from April 1 to the start of the fiscal year , in support of his contention of " a phony budget set-up as far as foreign aid is concerned . " In his budget message to Congress , President Truman called attention to the apparent discrepancy of $2,300,000,000 between the amount asked for and that marked for actual expenditures . He said the $6,800,000,000 requested would remain available for expenditures through fiscal 1949 and " would be used mainly in that year , " but added : " Experience with programs involving similar procurement problems indicates that the margin between the recommended appropriation and the $4,500,000,000 ex // penditure estimate during the same period.is reasonable . " To permit systematic and economical placement of orders for later delivery , appropriations must be substantially greater than expenditures in the initial phases of the program . In addition , bills for a portion of the goods shipped in one fiscal year are not paid until the following J ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large new program . " When it was called to the attention of Senator Bridges after the Republican conference that the " discrepancy " he cited ' might be explained by Administration allowance for actual disbursements after June 30 , 1949 , the chairman remarked : " If $6,800,000,000 is needed , the goods have got to be purchased and shipped quickly to be of any use . " Senator Bridges said it was his theory that the President " doctored the budget up in this way to get under a $40,000,000,000 total " of projected expenditures for fiscal 1949 . The President 's estimates totaled $39,700,000,000 . Senator Vandenberg , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , had assured him he would " ask for an explanation " from the Administration , Senator Bridges said , adding that his appropriations group " certainly is going to look into it . " " It 's a phony set-up -- -that 's a good word for it , " Senator Bridges concluded . He said he was " for the principles and objectives of a foreign aid program , " but would insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heels of his letter to Secretary of State George C. Marshall questioning the Administration 's good faith in its China aid policy , Senator Bridges ' charges were construed by some observers as indicating the Republicans ' ultimate line of attack on the Administration 's program . Senator Robert A. Taft , chairman of the Republican policy committee , has said he would seek a substantial reduction in the $6,800 , - 000,000 appropriation . More Witnesses Heard The Senate Foreign Relations Committee , meanwhile , heard the amount challenged as inadequate by a spokesman for the National Farmers Union and as unnecessary and wasteful by a Detroit manufacturer . The manufacturer was Roy W. Gifford , chairman of the board of Borg-Warner International Corporation , and the farm representative was James G. Patton , president of the Farmers Union . Mr. Gifford argued for the export of fewer dollars and more American industrial know-how as the most effective method of putting Western Europe back on its feet . He told the committee he was all for the rehabilitation of European industry and that while it was clear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the money provided was supposed to go for this purpose it was not explained how . the rehabilitation was to be effected . The greatest obstacle to Europe 's industrial recovery " lies in her antiquated manufacturing methods and marketing techniques , " the witness contended . He said the Continent was more than a hundred years beind this country in such matters , and added : " We 're so far ahead of everybody in production methods that we have n't got a friend in the world with the possible exception of Canada . " Instead of " increasing our bad risks " through large-scale expenditures in Europe , Mr. Gifford proposed the creation of an American council for aid to European industry as part of any administrative organization to carry out the Marshall Plan . " Business Basis " Doubted He proposed to obtain the services of American industry 's executives , engineers , production and marketing experts and technical specialists to.teach this country 's industrial methods to European manufacturers . He expressed confidence that American business would gladly join in such an effort to increase production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism . Mr. Gifford questioned whether any Government agency , however expert , could handle $6,800,000,000 intelligently and effectively . He said the fund might be distributed as outright ' gifts " but it certainly . could not be delivered to Europe on a business basis . " The witness singled out Great Britain for special attention , explaining that because of the difficulty of competing with American manufacturers in world markets " she has tried to take refuge in cartels and price agreements which are merely blankets to colter her production inefficiencies . " " We all want to see England and the Empire become prosperous again , " he said , " but unless Britain revolutionizes her industry and her selling methods , she has very little chance for genuine recovery and probably will even slip backward . ' Patton Urges U. N. Action Mr. Patton espoused the objectives of the recovery program but said it should be undertaken by the United Nations . He described the $6,800,000,000 asked by the Administration as " only half a loaf " and complained that the program left countries of eastern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " he said , " to abandon the plan than to lanuch a scheme for colonializing lother nations with the certainty of resentment , needless loss and inefficiency , and probably war at the end of the road . " Clark M. Eichelberger , for the American Associatidn for the United Nations , urged that Congress impose no interference with the normal trade relations between Marshall Plan countries and those of Eastern Europe not under the ERP . He said this trade continued " despite the announced intention of the Coininform to block the program . " Urging the greatest possible use of United Nations machinery , Mr. Eichelberger said the ERP Was but the first step toward world prosperity and that once Europe was back on its feeti prosperity there would depend on " how well they cooperated ' through the economic machinery of the United Nations and its specialized agencies such as the World Bank and Monetary Fund and the projected International Trade Organization . " Would Lift Food Output H. J. Heinz 2d , president of the Pittsburgh food concern , told the committee there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nutritional level is raised ? ' He urged that Marshall Plan countries be supplied with badly needed fertilizer and farm machinery to increase the productivity of the farms of Europe and to facilitate the traditional flow of foodstuffs from Eastern Europe . Another witness was Arthur Shutzer of New York , state executive secretary of the American Labor party , who termed the Marshall Plan " a blueprint for atomic war " and proposed adoption instead of the foreign aid ideas of Henry A. Wallace . Indications of narrowing Congressional opposition to the recovery program as a result of Senator Vandenberg 's rejection of the State Department plan of administrative organization came today from Senator Taft . " It seems to be a very constructive and sound approach to the problem , " he said . Another Republican Senator who said privately he would vote against the program suggested that the Vandenberg proposal " probably will swing ten or more doubtful Senators over to support of the legislation . " He is one of the twenty Republicans who will meet again privately one night this week to consider aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
