There was considerable reluctance among members of Congress to discuss the sea meeting at all until more details concerning its Jetting ana purpose had ' been dis:llosed ; also there was an undertone of disappointment , which Tread through various groups , that the President had not taken congress and the people more into - Os confidence in this latest stroke ) f diplomacy .

Libby , executive secretary of the National Council for the Prevention of War , issued a statement saying he regarded the joint Roosevelt-Churchill message as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axis powers . " Informed officials in the administrative arm likewise expressed the view that the eight-point statement of " common principles " of the United States and Great Britain might more properly be termed " peace aims " than " war aims , ' " although they emphasized that the main job toward the realization of peace was the destruction of Axis tyranny by some means . Look for Roosevelt Move Congressional leaders especially looked to the President for the next move . They expected that he would indicate soon after his return to Washington the extent to which the lease-lend program would have to be expanded , having reached the conclusion long since that an enlargement of " all out " aid is necessary . Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas said that it was , ' ? in the realm of possibility " that a new lease-lend appropriation would follow soon , but he did not expect it to affect the series of three-day recesses that begins for the House on Monday . Commenting on the statement of Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill , the Speaker said it expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a very sane statement , " Mr. Rayburn said . " I did n't see anything wrong with it , and I think it will have a wholesome effect all the way around . " Senator Claude Pepper , Democrat , of Florida , most outspoken advocate of collaboration between the United States and Great Britain , characterized the statement as " magnificent " and " the nearest thing to a declaration of world independence It have ever heard . " " Around such declarations of the rights of man those who are free and those who want to be free can and will rally with an unshakeable determination to crush tyranny wherever it appears in the world , " Senator Pepper said .

Walsh of Massachusetts , a more Moderate critic and himself-chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee , called the joint Roosevelt-Churchill declaration a commitment " that goes far beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President in our history even presumed to assume . " Sees Enthusiastic Response " The worst of the matter , " said Senator Walsh , " is that the American people have been afforded no opportunity to pass judgment , Congress and the Constitutional concepts of representative government have been brushed aside , and the President alone , and on his own initiative , has undertaken to pledge our government , our nation and the lives of 130,000,000 persons Ind their descendants for generations to come . " Senator Alben Barkley of Kentucky , majority leader of the Senate , predicted that the statement of principles " will find an enthusiastic response in the hearts of all peoples everywhere who believe in freedom and democracy . " Senator Tom Connally of Texas , newly designated chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , broadcast his approval of the Roosevelt-Churchill statement soon after he heard it over the radio from London , as read by Clement Attlee , Lord Privy Seal .

" Numerous Senators and Representatives declined comment on the statement , either on the ground of its scope or its " indefiniteness . " Among these were Senators Walter F. George , Democrat , of Georgia , ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee , and Senator Robert Taft , Republican , of Ohio . Would Study Details Senator Warren R. Austin of Vermont , assistant Republican leader , who has supported the foreign policy and defense measures of the President , said the statement proposed a " good program . " " As to details , I would want an opportunity to study them , " Sena tor Austin added . Senator D. Worth Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was significant to him " that our foreign policy is released from London on the radio rather than from the United S '  - -  tes . " As to the content of the . statement of principles , . he said he wondered " whether it applies to India and other nations held in subjugation by England . " Illustrative of other comment were tke following : Representative Clarence Brown , Republican , of Ohio : " Primarily , it is a declaration of future intent , which of course must be predicated upon the defeat of Hitler . It un : - doubtedly was made in advance of any peace proposals . I can see some old friends of the past in that statement , like the League of Nations ' and ' Disarmament . ' " Representative John W. McCormick of Massachusetts , Democratic leader of the House : " The joint statement of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill , issued through the White House , sets forth that principle which is so essential for any kind of a permanent peace , that a peace must be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a real and lasting peace can be made . It is a message of peace , not of war , and God alone knows that all of us would like to have peace restored to the troubled world . " Senator Pat McCarran , Democrat , of Nevada : " This is a declaration based on the unwarranted assumption that the United States is a belligerent in this war . That assumption is unjustified . It is tantamount to a declaration of war by this country , which is the province of Congress only . " Senator Elbert D. Thomas , Democrat , of Utah : " The eight ideals are a great American pronouncement . They are thoroughly consistent with what has been the best in American theory of good international relationships . " Senator Sheridan Downey , Democrat , of California : " The declaration is of momentous and farreaching , importance , and should receive most earnest and careful consideration by all American citizens . All of us , I would assume , will agree with the high ideals contained in the first few points , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means suggested for carrying them out . " Representative Everett M. Dirksen , Republican , of Illinois : " I shall lend encouragement to any sound , decent and reasonable effort to bring about peace , and every effort to bring about world disarmament as long as it is scrapping of armaments by all nations . " Representative Adolph --  Sabath , Democrat , of Illinois : " It will have a wholesome effect in that those nations not yet conquered will band together with Britain , Russia and China and with the help of the United States stand firm against Germany . It is a wonderful agreement whereby Britain is willing to forego any gains . " Representative Stephen Young , Democrat , of Ohio : " President Roosevelt , in his historic meeting with Prime Minister Churchill , demonstrated that he has now taken the lead in the peace offensive . The common people of the world want peace and our President will achieve world leadership for this nation in the part lie is playing to bring to an end this senseless slaughter . " Representative Paul W. Shafer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old story . Another little bit or sates talk to get us into this thing . It 's just the old ' Save the world for democracy ' slogan dressed up in a new outfit . " Representative James W. Wadsworth , Republican , of New York : " The declaration paints an ideal toward which we all well might strive . It 's an approach to an enormously difficult and at the same time vital problem and at this moment it is impossible to visualize its countless details . " Senator W. Lee O'Daniel , Democrat , of Texas : " In my opinion it touches for the first time on something definite concerning our ultimate aims and this is something for which our people have been patiently waiting . " Representative Warren G. Magnuson , Democrat , of Washington : " Getting together was a fine thing for these two nations . I hope the enunciation of the aims is clear , so we will have definite cooperative aims and so we will know where we are going when it is all over . " Representative Dewey Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running true to form . He is taking action first and telling Congress about it later . " Representative Clare Hoffman , Republican , of Michigan : " If we get into this war we will know at least what we are fighting for . Churchill should be told that while he may run Great Britain he should keep his fingers out of our affairs and he would do well if he goes home and attends to the affairs of the British Empire . We 've had about all the advice we need from Great Britain . " Senator Theodore Green , Democrat , of Rhode Island : " The statement ought to have a very farreaching effect . I have n't had time to study all its implications , but my impression is , bearing in mind the last World War and its aftermath , it ought to have a good effect on the world , in so far as it states the ultimate aims for which the democracies are fighting . I think it was well worth all the trouble it must have taken Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillette , Democrat , o Iowa : " Of course , the ideas and the goals enunciated are lofty and I think all Americans are in accord with goals of this type . " But there were three very significant things to me . " First , it is unusual , to say the least , when the American people must learn their foreign policy from the sub-head of a foreign nation instead of getting it straight from our Executive Department . The press report released here was more or less supplementary . It would seem to me that Congress and the foreign relations committees of both houses should have been given the information first hand . " Second , these goals are to be achieved after the destruction of Nazism . This unquestionably is a commitment to a war policy before seeking the goals . " Third , there is a notable absence of concessions by Great Britain to the cause of peace . " Senator Robert R. Reynolds of North Carolina , chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing the four freedoms on India , Russia and other places right now ? I 'm not going to vote one penny for aid to Russia . Um not going to give one penny of the taxpayer 's money to Stalin , who has burned all the churches , stamped out religion and who has murdered Christians . " Representative Luther A. Johnson , Democrat , of Texas , ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee : " The principles of the agreement should , and do , meet with the approval of the American people . " Representative ' Earl C. Michener , Republican , of Michigan : " The real question is ' hat are we going to do about it . If it means guaranteeing all these desirable things to all peoples of the earth by means of military force and cooperation , then we should think twice before we speak once . " ' Representative Andrew J. May of Kentucky , chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee : " This is a proclamation backed up by the power of the two greatest nations on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men shall prevail .
