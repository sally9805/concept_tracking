armament in staggering amounts at blinding speed . They are right in assuming that mass production is the way to make a lot of something at minimum time per unit , and that the American nation has that trick down finer than any other nation on earth . The amounts will eventually be staggering . But for a good long time , while we are " making ready , " the speed is going to be anything but blinding . That is no one 's fault ; industry 's least of all . It is inherent in the nature of mass production . If , how  --  ever , the public fails to understand what mass pro  --  duction implies  --  and so far , many do not under  --  stand  --  a lot of people will be asking the question a man asked me the other day , not very good-naturedly either , " You fellows know how to make eight thousand automobiles a day , do n't you ? Well then , why ca n't you make one thousand tanks a day without all this stalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the answer would have been simply that we can do it and are doing it . The motor industry is already running trucks for national defense down the assembly lines with speed enough to please anybody . It can do that be  --  cause it was already mass-producing trucks and had plants set up for that very job . Tanks are different , so the plants must be different . When the gong rang no tank-m king plant was in existence . It is industry 's fault , however , that this fellow did not have enough previous information to prevent his ever asking that question . Such misapprehensions are just as dangerous for the nation in this emergency as for industry . For , unless the man in the street is told what mass pro  --  duction is and means , there will he plenty of futile , friction-causing trouble as months stretch on and nobody has yet seen those 1000-a-day , mass-produced planes which were so much in the headlines last fall . This very magazine is a beautiful example of what the public needs to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The job is prac  --  tically over when the boss printer gives the word and the presses start thundering out 3,300,000 identical copies for you to buy on the newsstand or have delivered at your home . Back of that moment lay along , laborious process of preparation . The man  --  uscript of this article ? which corresponds to the pro  --  duction model of a car or tank  --  had to be edited , set up on a monotype machine  --  which is a very compli  --  cated machine tool  --  then proofread for errors ; then laid out in chunks to fit illustrations and advertise  --  ments on the same pages ; then proofed again ; then molded and made into sets of curved , nickel-faced electrotype printing plates which are then carefully fastened onto the plate cylinders of the press ; then tested for correct adjustment , color register , and so forth , in a series of test runs of a few sheets each . Without a maximum of time and care in each step , the finished product would be a mess . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far trickier and more complicated . Monotype equipment , electrotyping processes and machinery , presses  --  all had to be developed , designed and built sometime . The presses were special jobs for printing // this particular magazine , originally requiring years for blueprinting , constructing and testing . The paper that whirls through the presses so casu  --  ally is itself the end product of a whole industry that starts with forest trees in the north woods and goes through an intricate history of transport , chemical and production problems before the fin  --  ished roll comes off the delivery truck at the print  --  ing plant as per invoice . The inks come from an  --  other industry , and so , for that matter , do the wire staples to bind the pages together . Each involves its own special machine tools , production setup , techniques , research laboratories and raw materials from hither and yon . Before the Wheels Turn TN A WAY , it would be simpler for the magazine 1 staff to skip production setups and machine tools , learn how to make paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood blocks or copper plates , and print the magazine strictly by hand . It could be done . But it would take years to produce one copy of the magazine that way , let alone 3,300,000 a week . As it is , once the whole ramified setup is har  --  moniously complete , from Canadian lumberjack to newsstand , mass production in printing is so simple that a newspaper can get a bulletin off a telegraph wire into your hands in black and white within an hour . Just the same way , a complete Chevrolet comes off the assembly line made up of parts that were delivered at the start of the line , the morning of the same working day . But the setup itself ? the machine composed of many industries , machines and processes  --  which produces the newspaper or the car , would take a good five years to design and build from scratch . Those are the two aspects of mass production  --  speed in the long run , time-consuming complica  --  tions and adjustments and tooling up in the pre  --  ceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , now practically synonymous with mass production in the public mind , only thirty-three years ago . Car makers started with the idea that only cars made singly by hand would be any good  --  partly , I suspect , because nobody had the nerve to take a leaf out of the sewing-machine manufacturers ' book and tackle the job of organizing and tooling up for mass production of cars . I can well remember how the Cadillac people won the Dewar trophy in 1908 by demonstrating the use of interchangeable  --  meaning identical and so mass-producible  --  parts in motors . They took four of their cars , tore them completely down , scrambled all the bits together and put them back into four complete cars  --  and they all chugged away . Today , that stunt would attract attention only if it did n't work . The trouble is that , as of today , the efficiency of mass production has had all the play , and the complications of make-ready have received none . Not long ago I heard a fellow snorting about how he heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into production , whereas a man down in Louisiana had got into the papers by making a tank with his own hands by guess in a few months . I have n't seen the homemade tank in question , but even if it is the best job in the world , it proves little about anything . That tank , at best , is just the pro  --  duction model at the very beginning of the chain  --  the dummy of a new magazine to be published in quantity if , as and when the raw materials , machine tools , plant schedules and tests necessary for mass production can be worked out . That huge weight of blueprints does n't indicate hampering red tape . It indicates necessary planning . Several hundred pounds of blueprints have to be shipped to each assembly plant every time a new model of an auto  --  mobile goes into production . Without them , no car would ever come off the assembly line at all . Now suppose we wanted to start a new and dif  --  ferent magazine called The Wednesday Evening Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ferent . Instead of filling it with accurate informa  --  tion , entertainment and advertisements designed to sell things , we want our magazine filled exclusively with information that is n't so , stories that are boring and advertisements to keep people from buying things . We want to print it on a nine-inch strip of paper rolled on sticks , Japanese style , in colors that no printer ever saw before , on a special new paper that no mill now makes and on which no ink now manufactured will print . No such magazine would make sense , of course . But neither does war or preparation for possible war make any economic sense . The idea of peace  --  time production is to make something another fel  --  low wants and get it to him when he wants it and expects it . The idea of war production is to make something the other fellow Continued on Page 72 ) lay over on her side , the sail thrashing and throbbing as Roger Kane kept the sheet in his hand .

That was a good dive . It encouraged me . " The rain was pour  --  ing out of their hair , over their faces . They were drenched and they laughed . The rain grew less . " Do you see what I see ? " he asked . The motor sailer . " " The Pauline A looking for her mistress . " He was n't laughing . He had a hard expression . The cruiser came toward them .

The skipper brought the cruiser up under does n't want and did n't order , and de  --  liver it at the time he least expects it , in a form he does n't expect either . It is just inverse economics . Because they have shown they can mass-produce millions of magazines week after week , we ask the publishers of this magazine to handle the new job for us . Then we wait months , and maybe years , and finally get very ex  --  cited because no magazine has yet ap  --  peared on the newsstands . We make heated inquiries , and then out comes a story which the publishers thought we would realize without being told , be  --  cause its details are necessary parts of the preparatory work implied in a prod  --  uct such as we ordered .

" Larry shouted to the skipper . Walter edged the cruiser nearer . Larry dropped down onto the stern of the thirty square meter . He was still in flannels and a blue coat . He was shoulder-soaked ; he looked pale , an  --  grier than Pauline had ever seen him . He showed his lower teeth , but he looked too smooth . He came amid  --  ships to the cockpit .

He swam to it and she pulled him up to the boat . " You 're sure that you want to take Pauline 's hand and be pulled in ? " Roger called override . " The tide 's flowing .

If you want the Gettysburg Address printed , you have to start fresh with the letters that will print it . That is why special new plants are being built as fast as possible in De  --  troit and elsewhere to apply mass production to planes and tanks and aviation engines and the other crying needs among defense items . In them , for instance , will be special-made ma  --  chine tools for boring cylinder blocks of a size that no peacetime motor-plant tools ever bored or ever wanted to . Assembly-line setups for automo  --  biles have little to do with what an as  --  sembly line for tanks should be . Caterpillar treads are n't wheels , can-light non are n't windshield wipers , machine gun mountings are n't rumble seats , and the relations among these various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So a vast mid error goes to work out the beat as  --  sembly setup , even after the various parts are satisfactorily tested . It is a far bigger job than the annual change-over in motor plants , because it is a matter of fundamental differ  --  ences instead of slight alterations be  --  tween this year 's model and next year 's . Even that annual change-over usually takes a good year to accomplish , with nobody loafing around either . This job amounts to inventing in a few months new industries that , at normal peace  --  time pace , would take a generation . As proof , consider that , although the United States has been making the best transport planes in the world for fif  --  teen years , real mass production of such planes had not yet arrived when the defense emergency broke . You could see it all most clearly if national defense had proved to be a job for Hollywood , which specializes in mass production of entertainment . In the movie industry , practically everything that goes on is make-ready . Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound stage pro  --  duces one minute of usable him . Cast  --  ing , script writing , conferences , cos  --  tuming and actual shooting are all aimed at readying the master film , the production model , from which as many copies as the amusement business needs are then run off in a little build  --  ing down in one corner of the lot , called the laboratory , occupying a negligible percentage of the total studio area . They do n't even bother to call it a fac  --  tory . A biologist would call that atrophy of the production function . I call it a fine dramatization of what I 'm talking about . The public might well make a mistake as to where to have a model of an Allison motor manufactured and how long it would take .

" The Problem of Changing Models Another hurdle in the path of our Wednesday Evening Post lies in un  --  predictable pressures from competi  --  tion . Yes , we have a competitor , just as perversely uneconomic as we are , and already operating at top speed . Just as we are starting to print , comes word that the fellow working the other side of the street has a new dodge to make his stories and articles worse than ever  --  perhaps just a simple little thing like abandoning paragraphing altogether . We have to match that . So we tell the publishers to stop the presses and get rid of all paragraph in  --  dentations . They groan and say , " All right , if you say so . But well have to throw the whole job away and reset everything . We have to start right back at the typesetting again . " " But we aren'j. changing a single word , " we say . " Do n't you guys know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that waste motion ? " Put that in terms of fighting planes . We are all tooled up to mass-produce fighters that will maneuver well at 400 miles an hour , and then our potential enemy takes to the air with a plane that maneuvers just as well at 450 . The difference lies in a new curve on the fuselage and a redesigned motor . No use ignoring it and sending our pilots up against him in our 400-mile jobs . That would mean losing a lot of our best-trained young men to no pur  --  pose . The military authorities go into a huddle with the plane producers and the producers go wearily back to the drafting board to make the changes ; a month or a year may be lost . Both the manufacturer and the nation are lucky if they have n't gone too far overboard on plant capacity before this emergency strikes . The Extra Thousandth Revolutionary changes come thick and fast too . When this war started , there was little armor round pilots ; now half an inch of armor plate is called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an inch thick ; now it 's two and a half inches , and thickening all the time . Each such change , highly advisable from the military point of view , means another production head  --  ache . Shears that will handle light sheet steel , for instance , would n't even dent this heavier stuff . Last spring it became illegal to divulge any informa  --  tion about manufacturing a gasoline modifier , because it was of great mili  --  tary importance . This product is fifteen years old , and used to be of no more military importance than how to make a certain brand of face powder . But as pressure for more performance was put on , it became more evident what this gas could do for fighting planes . With it , a flier can get that extra few miles of speed and few seconds less in climb  --  ing 10,000 feet that make all the differ  --  ence between whether he lands alive or dead . You ca n't hope to win with 99.9 per cent of standardized stuff that the other fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of something bet  --  ter and different that he has n't got . Many great races are photo finishes . We already had a watered-down ver  --  sion of that in the automobile business . If your competitor does something that goes well with the public , you have to do it too . But the strain is fur less intense . After all , if you do n't follow suit , or do it too slowly , in busi  --  ness , it 's only the sheriff that gets you . If you miss such a trick in war , it 's the enemy , and he wo n't be so lenient as even a bad sheriff . Or take this matter of liquid or air cooled aviation engines . At the end of the last war , it was agreed that air-cooled power plants were better , be  --  cause a stray bullet in the radiator would put a liquid-cooled job right out of business . Yet , in the present war , the most successful European fighter planes have liquid-cooled power , be  --  cause that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fly a given plane many miles an hour faster than its previous air-cooled motor . With that advantage in speed , who was going to get into a position to drill a hole in the radiator ? So the Amer  --  ican Army has supplied some of its present fast planes with liquid-cooled engines , and the Navy is playing it the other way with tremendously stepped-up air-cooled motors for fight-era . This is an argument that only time and experience will settle . Maybe both are right . But the point to be made is that , if either of them was asked to change type in the middle of a production program , it would mean delay in production . There are two reasons for changes  --  necessity and curiosity . A laboratory experimenter can and should reach out all over the realm of possibilities to see what will happen . because he never ( Continued on Page 761 ( Continued from Page 73f knows when something extremely use  --  ful will come out of scientific chance-taking . But a manufacturer must fig  --  ure out , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures from all directions , just where lies the boundary between necessity and quan  --  tity of production . It is not an easy decision . Unless the whole nation knows how difficult it is and why such de  --  cisions must be made , there is much ham pering trou ble ahead for everybody . Our country deserves its reputation for being abler than any other nation in mass production . Once our printing presses get set up , we can and will pub  --  lish armaments faster than anybody else could hope to try . In the mean  --  time , the public must be co-operatively aware that , if you want to make ring gears twice as big for a war machine as the ones now being made for peace machines , you have to start from the beginning with a new gear-cutting tool , new forging dies and , for that matter , and not to be overlooked , new ekills in the men who handle the ma  --  chine tools . Back last year , when I was asked to make a speech , 1 said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tional defense program was that the public did n't know how long you have to work on the make-ready before you can make a lot of any  --  thing . I still think this is so . For no  --  body has yet invented a substitute for time . ? Nevertheless , there are also several curious , little-known signs that the President can not always count on such acquiescence as Rayburn gave him at Chicago . One of the most striking is the story of the start of the President 's Monday-morning conferences with his congressional chiefs . It happened after the President had sent an important new message to the House every day for three days running . Each day he failed to notify Speaker Bankhead that a message was on the way . Each day Bankbead told newspapermen before the session that no message was ex  --  pected . And each day the arrival of a message fifteen minutes later made Bankhead look a fool . Rayburn , who feels a personal con  --  cern for the dignity of the House , and therefore of the Speakership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , he was not im  --  mediately involved , and could not complain directly to the President . But he spoke sharply to James Roose  --  velt , then his father 's secretary , and managed to get the idea of the 1$.1011- day conferences conveyed to the Presi  --  dent through several other channels . The President adopted the scheme as his own brain child . The conference system , promptly initiated , proved very useful . Meanwhile , Rayburn had sketched out a charter of his own fu  --  ture rights and dignities in a sentence of his protest to the President 's son . " I tell you , Jimmy , " he said . " if Um ever Speaker , this kind of thing wo n't happen to me more than once . " The Speakership Tradition The fact is , where most men are less bold in the White House than they talk when they leave it , the quiet-spoken Rayburn has been firmer than is gener  --  ally imagined . There have been times when he could not stand up against the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded to him . One such was when he refused a pressing presidential request to weaken the Smith committee investigating the Labor Relations Board , because he thought the investigation wise . An  --  other was when he restrained the Presi  --  dent from political reprisals against the embittered anti-New Dealer , Gene Cox , of Georgia . A close Rayburn crony , Cox is the strongest member of the vital House Rules Committee , which settles the procedure of debate and amendment on most items of legis  --  lation coming before the House . The President and Cox are as hard a pair to reconcile as any Rayburn must some  --  how bring together , for Cox distrusts the President only slightly less than the President detests Cox . Yet Ray  --  burn managed to prevent the outbreak of open war , by giving a blunt warning , " Hell , Mr. President , you ca n't go after Gene Cox . He 's at least five votes ( Continued from Page 23 ) on the Rules Committee . He 's the dif  --  ference . " Such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puz  --  zle of Sam Rayburn ? the reinforce  --  ment of his ambition to be master by his own pride , and by the peculiar conditioning of his long House service . After Rainey , Byrns and Bankhead , the first two weak Speakers , the third a very ill man , the traditions of the Speakership are beginning to he for  --  gotten by the man in the street . They are recalled all the more clearly , on the other hand , by Rayburn and the other older members and permanent officials who are really soaked in the lore of the House . Every man thus impregnated breathes something of the spirit of John Hampden , secretly itching to set the President and Senate at defiance , as though he were a Roundhead faced with Charles I and Strafford 's House of Lords . He wants the House to be strong , and because the House is so large and amorphous that it can not be strong without leadership , he wants the Speaker to be strong too . Rayburn feels he has a duty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be a bitter blow to his pride . " A man does n't learn his job in the House , " he often says , " until he 's had his head damn well bloodied a couple of times , but a leader may as well quit if his head is bloodied too often . " If Rayburn fails , his career will he a pretty parable of human ambition . He will find his triumph turning to dust and ashes in his mouth , after labori  --  ously climbing to a peak he could scarcely imagine when he started up  --  ward . Among the great officers of the American state , the Speaker of the House of Representatives willingly grants precedence only to the President and Chief Justice , and has claimed the right to march before the Vice Presi  --  dent ever since the Longworth-Gann episode . Yet Rayburn , now Speaker , was born to harsh poverty , in obscure surroundings . When the Civil War broke out , his father , William Marion Rayburn , was heir to a fairly prosperous farmstead in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joining Lee 's troops at eighteen , he fought through to the surrender at Appomattox , made his way home from Virginia on foot when the Yankees stole his horse , and found his house pillaged , his stock gone and his fields ravaged . With this grim start in life he boldly married Martha Waller , a fine , forthright country  --  woman , produced eleven children , and for more than twenty years struggled to wrest a living from his land for him  --  self and his family . Sam , born January 6 , 1882 , and officially christened Samuel Taliaferro , was the eighth child . Five years after he entered the world his father abandoned the unequal contest , sold out in Tennessee , and moved the whole Rayburn tribe to Texas . Having heard good reports of the black-belt lands , he led them to Fannin County , where he bargained for forty acres and a house about eleven miles from the little town of Bonham . And there the Rayburns settled , with a wandering uncle to make up the household 's number to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished them . William Rayburn had been a corn farmer in Tennessee , did not un  --  derstand cotton culture , and was help  --  less when damp weather destroyed all but two and a half bates of his crop . But the whole family worked hard , planting , chopping and picking cotton together , and somehow they kept food in their bellies and clothing on their hacks . Though he did his stint with the others , young Sam grew up a little apart from his brothers and sisters , for he had ideas of his own . His father , a Southern fire-eater after his experiences with the Yankees , took a passionate interest in politics , and subscribed for the South 's two leading political papers , the Louisville Courier-Journal and the Memphis Commercial Appeal , as soon as he could afford to . Sam , who picked up his three R 's quickly at the little country school , soon became a fervent reader of the political news , spelling out the long columns when his father was finished with them . He says now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it was too far back . It must have been very early in  --  deed , for the famous Texas orator , Joe Bailey , was his pattern of human per  --  fection before he was ten years old . His favorite reminiscence is of the first time he heard Bailey speak , when he was just ten . Bailey , then represent  --  ative from the Fannin County district , had come to Bonham to address a big meeting of his constituents at the county fairgrounds . On the adver  --  tised date of the meeting , Sam 's elder brothers were ahead of him in getting their father 's permission to attend-Sam 's chore was to haul wood for the winter . That morning Sam watched his brothers riding off to town , and for the rest of the day drove the farm team be  --  tween the house and the woodlot with scalding tears streaming down his face . At breakfast on the morning following , however , after describing the excite  --  ment of the rally , his brothers let it drop that Bailey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the breakfast table , washed his feet at the pump , threw a saddle on a pony , and was off to Bonham at a gal  --  lop , all in an instant . By whipping his pony every step of the way , he reached j the fairgrounds just in time to see Bailey , arrayed in the broadcloth and fine linen of Southern statesmanship ,
