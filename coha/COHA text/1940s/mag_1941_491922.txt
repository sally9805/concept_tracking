EYES trained on the frozen wilderness below , Fred An-derson , flying trapper out of Portage , Maine , and his partner , Clyde Leach , sat snugly in the heated cabin of the two-seat monoplane . Presently Fred saw three snowy mounds rising from the ice on a pond below . Those mounds meant beaver houses , and beaver houses , if alive , meant money . Fred eased in on the throttle and circled to look for a landing . He finally set his landing skis down on the snowdrifts covering near-by ice-locked Mud Pond . With ice chisel and traps , the fur hunters snowshoed up Dottie Brook to the beaver houses lying behind a dam built by the animals . Vapor from vent holes steamed as it struck the frosty air . The houses were alive , all right . Through holes in the ice , the trappers set five traps on the bottom of the pond . Then they hopped off to other sets in the wilds . Twice during the next four days they lifted the traps on Dottle Brook . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from five traps . The second visit they got four more and pulled the traps , left the rest of the inhabitants of the village for seed stock . The pelts graded three blanket , four large and two medium , sold for $292.50 . With beaver taken from other sets that week , they netted nearly $400 . " Not a bad week for two young fellows , " says Fred Anderson . Their season 's take was n't bad either . It demonstrated what a flier , a trapper and an airplane can do to change a business that had n't changed much  --  save for the introduction of the steel trap  --  since ancient man rigged a deadfall to snare a gaudy skin for his woman . Anderson has been flying the wilderness for seven years , transporting fishermen and hunters , freighting supplies to camps , furnishing all-around back-country transport . Leach has been trapping just about as long . The fur market , after long years of stagnation , came back to life during the winter of 1939-40 , led by extraordinary demand for the suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports . The boom brought flier and trapper together . Fur Trapping De Luxe GETTING a late start , they trapped only twenty-five days , spent week ends at home , and suffered none of the isolation that always has been associated with trapping . Many a weekday evening Anderson set his plane down on the snow-covered field behind his home , taxied right up to the back door in time for supper , and was gone again in the morning . Yet they covered farther-flung trap sets than any Maine trapper ever had before . In those twenty-five days last winter they took fifty-two beaver and sold the pelts for $1425 . Operating expenses for everything ran less than $150 , more than covered by a few side trips flying a geodetic-survey party . This winter they have added two more pilots , Fred 's brother , Alex , and Vince Rideout , to their company , and are operating three ships throughout the season for beaver . In addition , they have flown in and are servicing seven other trappers on shares . " Beaver is the big-money fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trapping are far apart and beaver ponds are separated by long miles . Trappers traveling afoot have to make most of their sets for less valuable fur . With the planes , we can concentrate on heaver . Do n't forget , either , that we have our pelts out a day or two after we capture them , ready to catch any bulge in the market . " Clarence Sproul , another wilderness flier , made his contribution to the new fur-trapping technique when he solved a problem for Louis Paquet  --  and , incidentally , for a lot of other wilderness fur hunters . Sproul flew up from New Jersey to dust the far-flung Aroostook fields with dry insecticides from the air and remained to become manager of Caribou 's airport and Northern Maine 's back-country transport agent extraordinary  --  ready to fly anybody , anything , anywhere , anytime . Last winter he flew twenty-nine trappers and their outfits to their isolated home cabins in an hour or so . It would have taken them a week or more of hard packing to go on foot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the job , and serviced them with supplies all winter at nominal charges . Louis Paquet was one of them . He 's on the list of forty-eight trappers using Sproul air service this year . Solving the Market Problem S OLVING Paquet 's problem made Sproul Maine 's first flying fur trader . Paquet runs fifty miles of trap lines on the Great Black River , against the Quebec boundary . One night his battery radio  --  nine out of ten trappers have them in their home cabins  --  brought him bittersweet news . Prime beaver pelts were bringing the high price of thirty-five dollars on the fur market . And there he was with eighteen fine pelts  --  five of them blankets , bigger than " large . " He could figure out no way to get them to market before spring , when the Alaskan and Northwest Territory pelts would be knocking the price down . He could n't turn the pelts over to Sproul to sell . No trapper can sell a beaver akin until , in his possession , it has been stamped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time from his trap lines to fly out and make the sale . The next time Sproul dropped in with supplies , Paquet put the problem up to him . The flier solved it . At the next bulge in the market , he drew a wad of money out of the bank , picked up Game Warden Supervisor Levi Dow at Fort Kent , and made therounds of trappers up the St. John River , back down the Allagash . Dow stamped and sealed the beaver pelts , collecting two donut " each for the state . Sproul graded the furs and paid the owners cash in hand for them . He flew home from that trip with $4000 worth of beaver . The next day he carried along Supervisor Charles Harriman , of Presque late , made his calls in that supervisor 's district , came back with beaver pelts worth a little over $3000 . Then he flew the furs to New York , caught the top of the market , and made a nice profit . Before the winter was over he branched out , buying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and otter . He used two planes , paid trappers over $60,000 . Catching the high markets gave them more money for their furs . They knew from radio reports that they had been treated fairly . Everybody was satisfied . This winter Sproul has four planes out and expects to double his last year 's business . " Sure , I made some mistakes in grading at first that cost me money , " Sproul told me . " But , surprisingly , most of the ! Cam-Musa ! on Page 53 ) trappers would n't let me . They wanted me to make a decent profit so I 'd stay in the business . " Fred Anderson and his associates concentrate on beaver . Clarence Sproul runs up about 70 per cent of his volume on the animal that made America famous in the fur marts of the world a century and more ago . Then countless thousands of pelts were transformed into high hats , and beaver plews ( prime pelts ) became the unit of currency in the wilds . It 's worth noting that the beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is playing a leading role in stimulating the fur market . Yet a few years back , when beaver pelts began arriving on the market after long years of absolute protection , furriers did n't know what to do with them . Such bulky , thick fur , growing on stiff , heavy skin , could n't be fitted into modern style conceptions . Trappers were lucky to get six or eight dollars for a blanket pelt . Then , early in 1936 , an inspired stylist took some beaver pelts , plucked out the long guard hairs , sheared the hair to half its natural length , thinned and softened the skin , and offered a product he called " sheared beaver . " Furriers could hardly believe that the lightweight , lustrous hroem , form-clinging garment was really the same fur that , when sewn into jackets fifty years ago , made women look like pudgy cinnamon bears . It took a few years for the new coats to catch on . But last winter the market was short on beaver pelts and prices zoomed . Selected skins brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable sum to them . The cheapest sheared-beaver coats , three-skin garments , retail at about $400 . The price rises to $1200 for creations of seven selected skins , exclusive of the sleeves . Dangers of the Trap Line " There 's no telling where the price will go , " the largest furrier in the East told me . " Someday sheared beaver may even go above fine mink . Mink delivery can be speeded up from the breeding farms . But beaver is , and will he for a long time , a decidedly restricted fur . " So beaver is worth going after , in spite of the many dangers . Most to he feared is the ice on a beaver pond , always thinner than on other bodies of water . The animals , swimming from the underwater entrance of the lodge to their food piles , keep the water agitated , preventing deep freezing . If Game Warden Wilfred Atkins , of Portage , had n't gone in to investigate why a car was parked on the main highway at the start of a trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gagnon 's name would have been added to the long list of trappers who have died after going through beaver-pond ice . Henry had been only three miles from the main road , tending some mink sets . He went into the icy water to his shoulders . He scrambled out and ran for the highway . But Warden Atkins found him a helpless , ice-shrouded bundle , less than a mile from where he fell in . The same thing could have happened to Clyde Leach , when he and Fred Anderson were setting traps behind a beaver dam on Thoroughfare Brook , near Churchill Lake . The temperature was forty-two below zero and they were three quarters of a mile from the plane when Leach broke through . He went stiff as a poker less than halfway to the ship . Anderson carried him the rest of the way , hopped with him to the tramway-tender 's cabin on Eagle Lake , and had him thawed out in a few minutes . That 's one more advantage of airplane trapping . It was n't danger or low price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , just in time to save the species . Every state having any left , and every province of Canada , slapped prohibitory laws on the killing of beavers . Those laws are still in effect . Most of them , however , provide that state authorities may open sections for trapping , when beaver dams are flooding or damaging farms or timber tracts . Under protection the animal has multiplied rapidly , until legal openings have brought the pelts back into the fur trade . Last winter fewer than 35,000 beavers were trapped in ten states , and 9011 of them were taken in Maine . During the last four years the state take has increased to that number from 2740 . Yet , in that period , the number of townships harboring beavers has increased from 450 to 593 . Game wardens have counted over 50,000 in these townships . The state 's beaver population may be twice that figure . Some experts say reproduction is three times the take , and assert Maine now has more beavers than ever before . So protective laws are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in effect . Last season , Montana with 8427 pelts , Michigan with 7668 , and Wisconsin with 5135 , were runners-up in beaver output . Alaskans marketed 31,397 pelts and the Northwest Territories contributed nearly as many last year . The fur is considered by furriers to reach a higher value in our Northern states than in Arctic regions , where the long and intense cold makes skin and nap so heavy that it is difficult to work . The beaver price last winter was a bonanza for the trappers , after lean years with priine beaver well under ten dollars , fox at a dollar and a half , mink at twelve dollars and all other furs correspondingly low . In 1831 , when young Kit Carson joined the mountain men and outfitted for his first big trapping expedition , he pledged 104 beaver plews to pay for his mule and saddle , Hudson 's Bay capote , powder and lead , three feet of twist tobacco and six traps . It took Kit three months to pay off the debt and get to trapping for himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation , food , all expenses for the winter , and left a few hundred dollars over . Fred Anderson and his partner got the price of a small plane out of twenty-five days ' trapping . " Supposing your engine conks out way back in the wilderness ; then you 're pretty much out of luck , are n't you ? " I asked Clarence Sproul . " Huh , you 'd be surprised how much service you can get in the back country , " the winged fur trader answered . Sproul found plenty of service one day when he was making a quick round to pick up everything he could to catch a strong fur market . Dropping on Munsungan Lake to see what Virgil Lynch had , his landing skis went clean through thin ice . By the time he had tossed $6000 worth of furs to firmer ice and debarked himself , engine and fuselage were disappearing into the black water . Only the wings were holding the plane up . Munsungan is three days ' pack from the nearest settlement . Clarence stepped into Lynch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got a house in Oxbow village . His predicament was relayed to Caribou airport . Sproul 's partner was away , flying supplies in the wilds . But Fred Anderson had just arrived . He hopped for Munsungan , and had Sproul and his furs at Caribou in less than three hours . The foundered ship could await salvage until the market sagged . The next day Sproul flew his pelts to Roosevelt Field , on Long Island , and caught the high New York market . Three wilderness telephone lines , one terminating at Oxbow and two at Dickey , strung from tree to tree , all bells ringing whenever anyone twists a crank , are life lines to the people of the wilderness . Wires are maintained by timber owners , loggers , power projects and state departments . At intervals , instruments are cut in at fire-warden lookouts , trappers ' cabins , lumbering camps  --  anywhere that one can be put under cover . Calls to outside points must be relayed over the regular system from Oxbow and Dickey . When there 's bad trouble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the main switchboard calla until they have sent help winging over the hills and forests . Stanley Greenlaw , making fox sets from his home on Clear Lake early in October , returned to the cabin to find his wife unconscious . The Oxbow operator found not a single flier at Caribou airport , but did catch Fred Anderson on Portage Lake , waiting on the weather to fly some gunners to hunting grounds . Anderson took off into the teeth of a wild thunderstorm that tossed the ship around like a leaf . He won through , though , and got Mrs. Greenlaw to a hospital operating table at Caribou just in time to save her life . Flying Anywhere Any Time Fred had help on that flight . Last fall the Civil Aeronautics Authority installed a four-direction beam and twenty-four-hour weather-report service at Caribou airport . Fred picked up the beam on his portable beam finder  --  for all the world like the familiar portable radio  --  and rode it back to the field . But even before the beam was installed , the north-country pilots had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are n't willing to fly anywhere any time you 'll never build the confidence that means earning a living up here , " Sproul told me . One winter day , with a blizzard roaring down from the north , ceiling where you found it , visibility almost zero , Sproul got word that one of his customers , Pete Pellerin , a World War veteran still suffering from the effects of gas , and trapping on Harvey Pond , was in bad shape . He was burning up with fever , his legs had gone useless and he had burned nearly all the firewood to which he could drag himself . The air-line distance from Caribou to Harvey Pond is only about sixty-five miles . But the best flier in the world could n't have found that little piece of water in that weather , flying high enough to clear the intervening rugged mountains . Sproul hedgehopped to Fort Kent , followed the St. John River to where the Allagash branches off , and trailed that stream . Most of the way his landing skis were skimming the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split-second action . He still considers that day 's work the toughest flying he has ever dune . But he brought the sick man back to Caribou . Instead of 130 miles , he had flown nearly 400 . But most of the messages that come over the wilderness wires are n't appeals for help from stricken men . They 're the growls of the hungry , sick of their own cooking and suddenly grown mighty particular , with aerial transport at their beck and call . " Whenever a trapper the other side of nowhere gets tired of the coffee he 's using , he hollers for Clarence Sproul , " the operator at Dickey says . " Then I really have to go to work . " ( Continued on Page 56 ) ( Continued from Page 52 ) She does , all right . For the minute that anybody calls Dickey or Oxbow , everybody at home along the line cuts in . They , too , have orders for the flying fur trader . By the time the line is cleared , the operator usually has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trapper have expanded amazingly  --  now that he can satisfy them . He used to consider himself sitting on top of the world with a side of salt pork , a bushel of beans , a few bags of flour , baking soda , sugar , salt and coffee , That was high living , with the meat he killed for himself . The trapper still kills his own meat  --  beaver tails , venison , bear meat and partridge are good enough for him , he holds . But he also demands , and gets , fresh , sliced bakery bread  --  freeze it hard as soon as it arrives and it will thaw out fresh as ever , they say  --  cakes and cookies , even pies . Besides such items , one week last winter Sproul took in four cases of oranges , a case of grapefruit , assorted cases of canned fruits and fruit juices , potatoes , cabbages , carrots , beets , parsnips , turnips , all available fresh vegetables , including ripe hothouse tomatoes , and twelve different brands of coffee . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pressure lamps , the daily papers , magazines and dozens of items that were n't thought of two years ago . Last winter 's weather was no bargain for any airman , but Clarence Sproul and his partner flew every day except two . Sproul does n't consider flying through Maine snowstorms as dangerous as flying in somewhat warmer regions . The snow is light and dry . There is no icing hazard . Besides , on skis , every lake  --  there are lots of them  --  is a landing field . Yes , as Clarence Sproul says , there 's a tot of service to be found in the deepest wilderness , if one knows how to get it . Mrs. Oscar Perry knows that . Her husband was lying unconscious , his head gashed , a shoulder , one arm and several ribs broken by a falling hemlock , while building a new home trapping camp on Chandler Pond last September . Mrs. Perry had a badly sprained ankle , suffered in getting Perry from beneath the fallen tree . Ambulance of the Air " Get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " her husband gasped as he lost consciousness . She could n't get up boulder-strewn Beetle Mountain , five miles away . Hobbling about the clearing , she gathered an immense pile of the brush and limbs . She touched a match to it . That brought the warden racing down the mountain  --  as he thought , to quell an incipient forest fire before it spread . He raced back up again , and called help from Caribou over the telephone line to Oxbow . By the time he got back to the scene of the accident the rescue plane was splashing its pontoons in Chandler Pond . Telephone lines , airplanes , radios , twenty-four-hour weather reports , radio beams , beam finders and all the rest , they 've changed life in the wilds . But when the plane sets the trapper down at his home camp and roars away , then the business of fur hunting proceeds just about as it did in the days when the voyageurs of the great Hudson 's Bay Company spanned the continent . Eugene Dupre , trapper for over forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Caucomgomac Lake , in Northern Piscataquis County . He tends a seventy-five-mile trap line that circles Allege-eh Lake to the north and returns to Rowe Pond . Dupre lands half a ton of supplies at his home camp early in September and spends a busy three weeks distributing these to the eight snug cabins he maintains along the line  --  each cabin fitted with cook-stove , cooking utensils , bunk and blankets . H. owns about 400 traps , ranging in price from four dollars a dozen , for small , nes to take mink and muskrats , to fifteen dollars a dozen for beaver size . He figures that his outfit costs about $1500 , excluding the value of the cabins , which he built himself . Hard Work Pays Big Money When he has finished distribution , fox fur has come prime and he sets his traps for them . Mink season opens November first . Raccoon , skunk , otter and weasel can be taken then too . The trapper plans to have all his 400 traps , except those for beaver , out by the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before December first . From then on Gene Dupre is tirelessly following his trap line , round and round , skinning the animals he takes , stretching and curing their pelts . His circuit takes about two weeks , unless a big storm slows him up or he spots a worth-while beaver village . In the latter case , he builds himself a lean-to and remains there until he has trapped out all but the " seed " reserve . Beaver , at its present price , is worth the time . Dupre is on the move from the first streak of dawn until he reaches the cabin where he is to put up that night . Usually the last miles are covered in darkness . If the day 's catch has been heavy , he is up until midnight cleaning and stretching the skins . Last winter he took fifty-four beavers , twenty-one foxes , eighteen minks , three otters , thirty-eight muskrats and six bobcats  --  bobcat pelts are n't worth much , but the state pays a fifteen-dollar bounty on them , which is good money . Dupre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the pelts of two fishers that got into his traps , he would have earned $160 more . But there is no open season on fishers , and he had to turn them over to the state . Beaver accounted for $1350 of the . total . Close to $2000 for seven months ' work is getting into big money in Northern Maine . But a few years back it is doubtful if that average winter 's catch would have brought $750 . Beaver makes the difference . With the promise of a rising market for all furs because of the war-made shortage . Dupre and all North Country trappers are looking forward to prosperity . Whatever they get , they 'll have earned it . Only the experienced trappers , with a well-established trap line , and well outfitted , can hope to equal Gene Dupre . But some beginners do pretty well . Two boys in the Sebec Lake district , just out of high school and unable to find jobs , borrowed traps , got credit for supplies and went into the woods last winter . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them nearly $900 besides  --  thanks to beaver . The capital of trapperland is Chesuncook , on the big lake of the same name , abbreviated to Suncook by the men of the wilderness . For more than a century Suncook has been the jumping-off place . It is still a trappers ' town . In its early days , Suncook was not only the headquarters settlement for as hard-bitten a bunch of trappers as ever went into the wilds , but the center of logging operations too . Either variety of woodsman made trouble enough . Together they blew off the lid . Here was founded a Boot Hill that acquired its permanent residents as bloodthirstily as any burial.plot of the Wild West ever did . Suncook cemetery boasted twenty-two graves before there was a single natural death in the district . Suncook sudden death was more messy than the clean gunshot departures of the old West . Ben Howe was the first to go . Ben , a lone trapper in a roomful of red-liquored riverjacks , spoke out of turn . He was knocked to the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was tossed out on the snow . Paul Peters hacked Johnnie Smart to pieces with his skinning knife in a dispute over a trap line . Con Donnelly met up with an Indian who had been raiding Con 's traps , and finished him off with a club . Old Anse Crowley , proprietor of a Suncook resort , offended a bunch of visiting trappers . They loaded his bumper of hard liquor with half a glass of aconite . Anse died outside in a snowdrift . Tommy Geroe was the fur hunters ' favorite moonshiner , until he began cutting his liquor . Then they tossed him off his piazza , which overhung a forty-foot precipice , and left the body there for the townspeople to bury . Stubby Doyle nosed out violent death though . Slashed clean across the throat with a skinning knife , Stubby staggered to his cabin and got his partner to sew up the wound with deer gut and a moccasin needle . " They 'll have to cut my head right off to kill me , " Doyle boasted when he was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of being in some of the most terrific battles in Suncook , he lived to die drunk in a Bangor alley . Anything that happened to Stubby Doyle he had coming to him , even the toughest trappers agreed . It was Stubby and Eli Badger who coveted Old Johnny Plourde 's trapping grounds around Loon Lake . But Johnny was too tough to fight openly . They sneaked into his cabin one day and stuck three capped sticks of dynamite in the kindling wood that the old trapper had placed in the stove against returning to a cold home . For some reason they plugged up the stovepipe too . When Plourde touched a match to the kindling and found the fire did n't draw well , he got on top of the stove to examine the stovepipe . While he was up there , the dynamite let go . The force of the explosion was sideways . Old Johnny was left sitting in the wreck of his stove and cabin , badly shaken up , but otherwise unhurt . Stubby Doyle fled the district before the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign of sudden death is a long-closed chapter in the annals of Suncook . The trappers are largely a sober , hard-working tribe . Many wives accompany their husbands into the wilderness and tend cabin while they are following the trap line . Their children go to school in Suncook , Portage , Caribou , Fort Kent  --  all the towns in the St. John valley . Suncook boasts that five of her sons have college degrees and are making good out in the world . But plenty of trappers are predicting that , with the price of beaver what it is , there 'll be new outlawry in the wilderness . In fact , it is beginning . Some years ago Game Warden Dave Brown , in a section of the Northern 57 Aroostook district against the Quebec boundary , reported that poachers were chloroforming beavers in his district . When this is done , the kits , which usually escape the traps , are killed and the colony is exterminated . Warden Murtha Johnson was sent up to help Brown . A few weeks later the two were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably at night . Then big Ralph Farley , the fearless son of three generations of wilderness men , was given the district . Farley moved into the Canadian village of Lac de la FrontiAre , just across the border , to see what information he could pick up . Almost the first person he ran into was little , rat-eyed Cleophonse Gerault , with a Canadian prison record long for his years . " You 'll get what Dave Brown got , " Gerault snarled at the Maine warden . Law in the Backwoods Ten days later , Ralph Farley , following a fresh trail , caught Gerault and a companion skinning chloroformed beavers . Their rifles were against nearby trees . The game warden covered the pair with his firearm , removed the shells from theirs and tossed the guns into the brush . Then he set out on a long , dangerous trail for a lone warden with two desperate men  --  nearly fifty miles down the St. John to Dickey . It would take until well after dark even to reach the telephone line . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flakes and the wind rising . Black night came , with only the warden 's flashlight showing the way . Gerault suddenly jumped from the trail into the brush . " Then I made as pretty a shot as I ever did in my life , " Farley relates . " The man was running , bobbing from side to side . I had to hold the light on him and shoot with one hand . I had to look after the other poacher too . It was snap-shooting , but he went down . " Everything happened so suddenly , Gerault 's partner stood frozen in his tracks . It took the warden a few minutes to lash him to a tree . That done , the light swung back to where Gerault should have been lying . He was gone . There were red stains where his body had marked the fresh snow , more blotches in footprints leading into the forest . Farley started in pursuit , but scarcely had he left the main trail when the overworked batteries in his flashlight died . The chase was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean through the thigh , the bullet nicking the bone , the wound bleeding at every step , made his way through that stormy night across the border , fourteen miles away . He laid up with other outlaw woodsmen . But not for long . Canadian authorities picked him up on another charge and stowed him away for a three-year stretch . Cleophonse Gerault has just finished that term and is free again . The price of beaver may lure him back to the Maine wilderness . " I 'd kind of like to have another crack at him , " says Farley . " After all , the killers of Dave Brown and Murtha Johnson have never been caught . " There 'll be illegal trapping , certainly . But unlawful taking of fur promises hard going . With one Fishand-Game-Department , warden-piloted plane already on the job , officials are considering a force of flying wardens , who will be able to patrol , in an hour or two , sections of back country that would require a week or more to cover on foot .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
