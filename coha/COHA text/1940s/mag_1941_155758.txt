Some they buried in Nuuana Cemetery , on a green slope overlooking Honolulu and the sea ; when the earth there was too crowded to take more , they dug trenches on Red Hill above Pearl Harbor , and the rest were buried there . <P> On the raw earth of more than 2,000 graves they piled asters , poinsettias , hibiscus flowers , and over the dead , Marines standing honor guard fired three farewell volleys . Their elegy was pronounced by Captain William A. Maguire , Chaplain of the Fleet . Said he : " Ah ... if every American had seen how quietly , yes quietly , men suffered , how gallantly they died , how courageously they thought about the next man , they would glory . " <P> Below Nuuana , the city under martial law was almost as calm as in peacetime . Except for the concrete barriers being hastily erected in the streets , Honolulu looked pretty much as it did before . The Army set up a rent commission , and merchants were watched to prevent food profiteering . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists still lolled about on the abbreviated beach ( a good hunk of it was washed out to sea last year ) , but in houses all over the Honolulu hills housewives were trying to figure out where to put an air-raid shelter . Almost 5,000 volunteers flocked into Queen 's Hospital to contribute blood to a blood bank . <P> But only in the daytime was Honolulu active . At night the blackout was complete-blacker than London ever had been . Most people dined at 5:30 and nobody went about after dark . In the beginning , sentries in the streets shot first and challenged afterwards . Kamaainas ( long-settled whites ) had to entertain themselves with card games and gossip at home in dim-lit , tightly-sealed rooms . No liquor was to be had , and candy sales went up with a rush . The hotspots-from the Royal Hawaiian to the plebeian Venice Cafe were shut tight . Overhead the air patrols constantly thundered . <P> Honoluluans were limited to ten gallons of gas a month . Although the Territory had only enough food stored to last for 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland would be maintained . Reason for Hawaii 's limited food lay in the fact that the sugar and pineapple factors never planted the diversified crops advocated by the military . Ironically , most of the handful of truck farms in Hawaii were in the hands of resident Japs . <P> Last week the Army was quickly putting into effect its M-Day plan , calling for the hurried planting of potatoes and other crops . But Hawaii was a long way from self-sufficiency . <P> The Department of Agriculture 's Surplus Marketing Administration drew upon existing stockpiles to help the Islands . Last week Franklin Roosevelt allocated $10,000,000 from his emergency fund to bolster SMA 's assistance to Hawaii . <P> The food that goes to Hawaii will probably not only feed the populace , but also afford a chance to save the factors ' crops . The ships that carry supplies to the Islands may well take back sugar or pineapples instead of returning in ballast .
