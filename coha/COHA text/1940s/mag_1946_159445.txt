Le grand Charlie 's letter of resignation reached the Assembly at 3 p.m. on Tuesday . Le souriant Flix ( smiling Flix ) , as friends have nicknamed the Assembly 's Socialist President Flix Gouin , read it rapidly . He paused , but there was no display from the floor . Just as rapidly , he read his reply . " M. de Gaulle ... I express . . . the nation 's gratitude and appreciation . . . . " <P> Then Flix Gouin asked : " Does the Assembly intend to elect the new President ... of the Republic ? " Cries of " Now . . . Tomorrow . . . Thursday ! " rose from the benches . A show of hands favored tomorrow . As briskly as a tobacco auctioneer , Flix Gouin adjourned the session . It had lasted five minutes . <P> Next day Destiny rapped at Flix Gouin 's office door , strode past his black poodle Jim , and confronted him above the coffee , cheese , apple and bottle of vin ordinaire upon his desk . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the news that he had just been elected ( 497-10-55 ) President of France . " I am touched , " he said . " I accept . . . . It is a bad situation , but I 'll try to do my best . " <P> Party Nonpartisan . No successor could have been more unlike tall , stubborn De Gaulle than short , amenable Gouin . In his homely , bespectacled , penguin-shaped person , the politicians of France , after six years of military leadership , had again taken full control of their country 's government . <P> Flix Gouin had been a Socialist since 1902 and a parliamentarian since 1924 . A schoolteacher 's son , a successful lawyer of Marseilles , he had never deviated from his party 's line . Yet few looked upon him as an implacable partisan . In 1940 he had been one of the 80 Deputies who voted against power for Petain . He had helped organize the Resistance . In 1942 the time came to flee , via Spain ( where he was interned for three months ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen president of the Consultative Assembly in Algiers and then in Paris . <P> At 61 , Flix Gouin is a systematic , hardworking politician who seldom loses his sleep or misses his meals . He loves his home and the company of his bridge-playing wife , one of France 's outstanding furniture designers . He loves his hobbies-art collecting ( he has 100 paintings , some valuable ) and hunting ( a crack 's helm , the little man in a big job had need to call on all his qualities of tact , energy and balance . <P> The Capital Problem . Staring the new President , and France , full in the face was inflation . " The capital problem of the hour , " said Gouin in an open letter to his fellow politicians , " is the defense of the franc . " Drastic measures were needed-at least as drastic as those of doughty Raymond Poincare , who won the 1926 " Battle of the Franc " with a deflationary program of heavy taxes and Government economies . <P> Sick though France was in 1926 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the black market , on primitive barter , on the sale of personal goods , on dwindling savings and equally dwindling hope . The sickness might prove mortal if France did not get her finances in order and her war-ravaged economy in full production .
