Total expenditures for the year were $1,708,036 , By Richard L. Strout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. J , Nov. 20 ? Sidney Hill " An , labor member of the National Defense Commission and head of the Amalgamated Clothing Wm keis Union , came back to the Congress of Industrial OrgaLizations convention today and made a face-to-face reply to the attack by John L. Lewis yesterday . In a bt eathiess session , he denied that the Amalgamated will leave the C. I. 0. , announced negotiations with Bethlehem Steel seeking to leach an ow cement on unionization , defended the national defense program and warned delegates who have followed Mr Lewis ' attack on New Deal fol men policies that they might be aiding appeasers , In this day of totalitarian war , Mr. Hillman warned , a man who does not co-operate with national defense may be guilty of sabotage . Recalling that in its five-year career the C. I. 0 . had not accomplished " all its objectives , " he pleaded for patience with the Defense Council which had been at work " only five months . " Mr. Hillman 's tone was conciliatory . Mr. Lewis sat direcily behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the past three months , he said , the unemployment problem may be " licked " when the C. I. 0 . meets next year , " I have the complete support of the President of the United States , " Mr. Hillman shouted , unleashing a demonstration from his followers . Outside of the " Vultee situation ' he said , strikes had been averted in all defense difficulties and this without coercion of labor . As to the Labor Act , he pleaded to workers to " give me a chance . " In any case , he said , workers would not wish him to do anything . " handicapping national defense . " Mr. Hillman took up point by point the criticisms made against him by left-wing labor groups , and discussed in detail the representation of union leaders in national defense machinery . In impassioned tones , he pointed to Europe . " I hope you are not resting under delusions that it ca n't happen here , " he cried . " Where is free labor in France ? Labor leaders in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will . Co-operate " I know that labor will cooperate in national defense as much as any section of the community . " He exclaimed . There was , a scattering of applause at this but many delegates still sat silent . Labor must reach its objectives " through the democratic process , and through no other process , " he continued . " Labor makes progress when it unites its forces , " he said in reference to the American Fed ' oration of Labor . " 1 know there are elements that can not participate in the demo cratic process " he shouted , " because their higher loyalty is to other organizations . What matters if they take orders from Rome , Berlin , or Moscow , they are all the same . " He denounced Communism in the labor field . " These people are a menace in the labor movement , " he cried . Mr. Hillman concluded his speech with a personal tribute to Mr. Lewis for " sticking to his guns " and urged nomination of Philip ' Murray to succeed Mr. Lewis if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hillman shook hands with Mr. Lewis as he concluded . Hillman Cites Gains Mr. Hillman was net by applause , confined , however , to tertian sections of the hall , He began deliberately stressing C. I. 0 . organizational gains of the past five years . He said he would have liked to have been present at the session yesterday , but that he had spent the day with Eugene Grace , President of Bethlehem Steel Corporation , attempting to bring its policy into line with the national defense policy . He noped also soon , he said , to meet the head of the Ford Company . This announcement created a sensation , for it is the alleged violation of NLRB decisions by these companies and their receipt of big defense contracts that more than any other one thing is resented by the C. I. 0. , and that has played into the hands of Mr. Lewis . With obvious reference to Mr. Lewis ' attack on him , Mr. Hillman said he harbored no resentment . In impassioned tones he urged delegates to take no action that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders come and go , " he said . " The history of labor ' is division , and every time we divide the enemy moves in . " , There has never been a suggestion that the Amalgamated Clothing Workers would leave the C. O. , he said , The first clash of the day came over a housing resolution critical of the New Deal . Irving Abrahmson , member of the Amalgamate , and leader in the New Jersey Industrial Council , denounced the fact- that no praise was accorded President Roosevelt in this or any of the resolutions . " We might believe Wendell Willkie had won the election , " he exclaimed , launching a personal attack on Mr. Lewis . Applause from considerable units of the convention followed . Left-wing groups immediately accepted the challenge . The resolution was passed without dissent . A series of other resolutions urging stronger economic and social action followed .
