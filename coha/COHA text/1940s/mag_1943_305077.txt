At a crisis point in the 1929 stock-market panic , the late great John D. Rockefeller Sr. , then 90 , issued a calm statement from his home at Pocantico Hills on the Hudson : " My son and I are buying sound common stocks . " Some Wall Street cynics thought his real interest in the plunging market was to cover up a big short position , but John D. 's millions induced buying confidence that stemmed the terrible tide for one day . Last week the tickers clicked out a statement that sounded like old John D. talking backwards : his son was selling $25,000,000 worth of oil stocks to buy war bonds . <P> Again for one day the Rockefeller millions swayed the uninitiated : led by the oils , the market nosedived .

" Their only reason : " Mr. Rockefeller is out of town . " By week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street wise guys were still guessing the reasons for the on-again-off-again news . Main guesses : <P> &gt; Cynics were sure that the bonds to be bought were not war bonds but tax-anticipation notes , against the day when the Rockefeller estate must pay for the death of John D. , now 69 . <P> &gt; They also reasoned that the drop in the market might have scared the Rockefellers-and their underwriters-away from carrying through so large an offering . <P> &gt; Others suspected that SEC had shown interest in the deal , on which , apparently , it had not been consulted in advance . <P> Whatever the facts , one thing was certain : the original move was economically illiterate . If Mr. Rockefeller sells stock to buy Government bonds , a lot of other potential bond-buyers would be using their own capital or income to buy his stock . To the extent that the new stockholders might otherwise have bought bonds instead , the U.S. Government would exchange hundreds of small bondholders for one big one , while the fight against inflation would , if anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
