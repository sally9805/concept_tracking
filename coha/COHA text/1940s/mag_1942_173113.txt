THE GATES OF AULIS-Gladys Schmitt-Dial ( $2.75 ) . <P> In this first novel , with great seriousness and intensity , Miss Schmitt makes a try at a genuine U.S. tragedy .

Hold me , bear me up lest my hand , trailing back through fathomless water , encounter a dead man 's face . " Rather more successful is Carl 's image of Ellie : " Oh , she is mad ... she veers like an abandoned ship on wild water by night , all sails down , and the wheel spinning first left , then right , and rats pattering over the empty decks , and one bell ringing constantly through chaos , a bell still saying loudly , love , love . . . .
