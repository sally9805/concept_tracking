When Communists ' votes helped President Gabriel Gonzalez Videla into office last November , he paid off with three Cabinet posts-the first for the comrades in South America . Of the three , Agriculture pleased the party most . The wretched lot of Chile 's 500,000 landless campesinos invites Communism . For a day 's work , the average field hand gets 35&cent; , a large piece of hard bread , and , occasionally , a sack of beans . His home ( on most farms ) is a small , windowless , mud- &-thatch; hut , with a dirt floor . <P> Lately Chile 's rural roto ( ragged one ) has been hearing talk of farm unions that might get him more pesos . " What can we lose ? " he says . <P> Agriculture Secretary Miguel Concha has led the Communist agitation for legalized farm unions . Last week Gonzalez Videla had on his desk a bill , passed by Congress ' rightist majority , designed to block Concha 's efforts and to maintain existing farm labor conditions . The bill restricted each union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forbade them to federate , and banned the troublemaking migrant workers from membership . Cream of the clauses was one stipulating that only literate workers could join . This barred 90% of the campesinos . <P> Man in the Middle . Leftists screamed . Rightist landowners replied that the alternative was to let Communists , who had already grievously hurt the Chilean economy by endless strikes in coal , copper and nitrates , take over the whole business of agricultural production . Gonzalez and his Radicals , who favored genuine , non-political unions , were caught in the cross fire . <P> Chile was getting another lesson in a familiar contemporary Latin American pattern . Poverty made Communists ; Communists used poverty to advance their political ends ; reactionaries answered with repressive measures that perpetuated poverty .
