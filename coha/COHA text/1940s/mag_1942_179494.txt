The patient was suspected of heart disease . But , because she was fat , female and modest , the doctor could not put his ear to her chest-and how else could he listen to her heart ? Dr. Ren Thophile Hyacinthe Lannec rolled a sheet of paper into a tube and held it against her chest . The heart noises came through perfectly to his respectfully distant ear . <P> That was the first stethoscope , in 1816 . At New York 's Academy of Medicine last week , Dr. Walter Barclay Mount reviewed the history of this No. 1 diagnostic tool . <P> Today 's familiar metal and rubber stethoscope ( Greek for chest examiner ) is quite different from Lannec's-a hollow bell or a cap with a hard rubber diaphragm to be placed on the chest or back and tubes to transmit sound to the earpieces . And its use is anything but simple . Since Lannec hundreds of books have been written about the snaps , crackles , hums , gurgles , murmurs , booms , bubblings , gratings and rustlings which Lannec first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a healthy heart is lubb-dupp : a hollow boom as the ventricles contract to pump blood , followed by the soft snap of the closing of valves to the aorta and lungs . Weak , doubled , out-of-step or extra sounds mean trouble . <P> When the heart valves are defective and wo n't close properly , there is sometimes a telltale swishing as blood eddies back into the heart chambers . A sound like the rustle of new leather is an indication of pleurisy . <P> To diagnose chest diseases , doctors listen for rattling sounds which Lannec called rles . Patients with early or late pneumonia have a crackling sound like hair being rubbed through the fingers . Tuberculosis can sometimes be spotted early in its course by a similar sound , which may later change to a clear , metallic ring .
