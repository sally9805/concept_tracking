Armored cars paraded through flag-draped Prague last week . Outside the huge Industrial Palace stood a cordon of Czech security police carrying Tommy guns . Inside , 1,000 delegates to the Ninth Congress of the Czech Communist Party met . Joseph Stalin was named " honorary chairman " of the meeting ; his representative , Cominform Boss Georgy Malenkov , attended in his stead . The congress sent a telegram to " Dear Comrade Stalin " : " We shall always stand faithfully by the side of the U.S.S.R. " <P> Measures to insure this faithfulness were conspicuous . Party Secretary Rudolf Slansky reported that 107,133 party members had been expelled so far this year . That left 2,311,066 members , of whom 22% were " candidate members . " It had been a difficult year , Said Slansky : " Foreign and hostile elements sent by the orders of foreign spy groups " had penetrated into the party itself .
