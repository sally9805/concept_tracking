Just after Thanksgiving , 1942 , the Coast Guard Reserve yawl Zaida , a former pleasure yacht , went out on Coastal Picket patrol watching for submarines fifty miles offshore . She carried a crew of nine men . At the end of her five-day patrol a storm hit her hard ; she capsized , righted herself , and was left drifting helplessly before the terrific gale , with her mizzenmast smashed , her sails torn , and three men injured . Her distress signals were picked up by radio , and Headquarters Commander Eastern Sea Frontier began directing a search for her by ships and planes . About twenty-four hours later a British destroyer sighted Zaida wallowing in mountainous seas and took her in tow ; but in the middle of the night the towline parted and the yawl disappeared in the dark . At this point Lieutenant Thompson resumes the narrative this month. ? The Editors THE morning after the tow had parted and we had lost sight of the Limey destroyer we gave up thinking about being rescued and decided that our fate was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seas had punished us so much that we had felt pretty helpless , but when daylight came we turned to the job of fixing up as best we could . Zaida was pretty lively . She still pitched and rolled so hard that we could n't do much because we had to keep one hand wrapped round something for support . Most of the day we just puttered about with little things . We checked over shrouds and rigging to see how much damage had escaped our notice . The spreaders on the mainmast had been weakened , possibly by being hit hard when the life raft carried away . Georgesaid there would be no use trying to sail on a port tack until we had strengthened the port shroud ; otherwise the mainmast might carry away in a blow . The real trouble was canvas . The storm trys'l had flapped in the wind until it was nothing but rags . With the mizzen gone too , we had only a forestays ' ) and jib . Joe Choate , still too weak to come up on deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we could convert the jib into a storm trys'l and rig it on the mainmast . When George crawled out on the bowsprit and unfastened the jib he found it had been chafed or torn , possibly from contact with the hawser while we were under tow . We wrapped it in a clumsy ball and stuffed it down the companionway , to work on it in the cabin . It was too dark in the cabin to work without light , but the batteries were so weak that we did n't want to use the power for lighting . On the cabin bulkhead , just over the little fireplace , a kerosene lamp swung in gimbals so that it would keep a horizontal position at all times . We had grown to hate that lamp , because it kind of hypnotized us all when the Zaida began to roll . You could always tell how much she was rolling just by watching that lamp swaying back and forth , back and forth like a drunk standing still . Smitty had wanted to bust the thing and get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we ran out of kerosene Smitty mixed some gasoline with lubricating oil , and whipped up something that worked pretty well as a substitute . Windsor proved to be the best man we had for patching sail . At some time or other he had worked as a sailmaker , although he had n't said anything about it . As soon as he got squared away with his sail twine , beeswax , patching canvas , needles , and sailmaker 's palm he was happy . The worst part of this jib-conversion job was that our marconi-rig mainmast had a sail track for those metal slides sewn to the luff of the mains'l or trys'l . Of course the jib did n't have any slides , so we had to cut them from what was left of the trys'l luff . Windsor had the extra job of sewing all those slides at regular intervals along the edge of the jib so that they could be fitted to the sail track on the main . It was slow work . With Jim Watson strapped up in splints and lashed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruddy face , and Smitty not too handsome with his black eye and swollen nose , there were only six men left to stand watch . The Chief had begun to take his turn as soon as we were crippled . We tried all kinds of watches . Nobody had strength to stand four-hour watches after what we 'd been through . First we tried standing two hours on and four off . That was the way it went most of the time . It was kind of tough on sleep , and when things moderated a little we tried having only one man on deck during a watch , with another man standing by below so he could be called at short notice if needed . We kept wondering just where we were . The standard deck log , which usually lay on the chart shelf at the foot of the companionway , had been washed down into the bilge when we capsized . Somebody dragged it out and dried it off , but the pages stuck together and it was n't any good . From then on the skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he kept in his pocket . Joe Choate started to keep a log of his own . Because he was too weak to do anything , and because his wrist watch was the only timepiece still running , he became the official duty officer who would call men for their trick , send them up to relieve those topside , then ask them for course and speed when they came off watch . We had run out of the worst of the first storm on December 6th . Jobhie and Smitty had got up enough courage to hoist the forestays'l that afternoon and had been able to make a reach on the starboard tack , on a south-southwesterly course . That gave us a little more courage , because the canvas helped steady the yawl and things were a bit more comfortable below . We kept sailing most of that night , even though the wind began to freshen after midnight . Funny how that mid-to-four watch always seems to be the weather watch ; during those hours the sky gets round to deciding what it will dish out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , we could tell that we were in for another blow ? or more of the same . All through the morning of the seventh the wind built up seas until we had to haul down the forestays'l and run under bare poles again . The worst of it was that we lost all we had made the day before , because the wind blew us south and east until after dark . During that night the weather moderated again ; we hoisted the forestays'l and set our course once more toward land . WAD tried to use the marine radio elephone on . oida as soon as we had bailed enough water out to know she was going to stay afloat . But the aerial had been rigged between the mizzen and the mainmast , and when the mizzen carried away , the aerial broke . By the time we had fixed some sort of jury rig for the aerial we found that the batteries were so weak we could just barely hear the shore stations on our frequency . George and Smitty were the best mechanics aboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time . They had lifted it out of the engine-room hold underneath the cockpit and carried it below to work on it . They swore that when they had the generator working again they were going to take the head off the auxiliary engine and do a job on that . The skipper said he 'd settle for the generator just then because he was anxious to get the radio phone working . Before they were done with the overhaul and had tried to use the watered gas , someone else had checked the radio phone and had found water in it . Smitty and George finally began to get some power back into the batteries . At first the generator choked and backfired ; then it began running by fits and starts . As it got warmed up it would race along on good gas for a minute or so , then cough and slow down . Smitty would dive for the adjuster , monkey with it until the motor picked up again , then cock his head on one side and worry over it like a doctor looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger . After a while we could turn the radio on long enough to hear our shore station calling other Picket Boats . That cheered us up . About daylight on December 9th George and Smitty announced that they had enough power in the batteries to send a message , but they could n't promise the juice would last very long . So the skipper picked up the telephone and started talking . He had done it so many times before , when the phone was dead , that nobody paid much attention to him . We almost fell over when we heard the Block Island station answering him . It caught him by surprise too . He had said that we had an urgent message , but when he was told to go ahead with his message he could n't seem to think what to say ! Finally he came through with five words : " Condition favorable , three men injured . " The Block Island operator repeated the message , and the skipper acknowledged : " Message correct . " I 'll never forget Smitty 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what he expected the skipper to say . We could n't very well give our position because we did n't really know . Of course both the skipper and Choate had kept their own dead reckoning , based on our having been blown south and east , having sailed southwest for a day , then having been blown south and east again . Smitty claimed that came out to some kind of position and said the skipper should have been ready to give it . The skipper kept his mouth shut . During the rest of the morning he turned on the radio each hour at the scheduled time . About noon we heard our own shore station calling CGR 3070 . The skipper tried to reply , and was given a message to the effect that we should charge our batteries without using the radio again until 2000 that night , when we should be expected to report our position . Other stations would be listening for us . The skipper tried to acknowledge but could n't tell whether or not his " Roger " got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was the first time we had been in real contact with a living soul for what seemed like a month of Sundays . Smitty and George went back to the generator and started it up again . The rest of us began straining enough gas to have a supply in store . All afternoon we just waited . Not that we forgot to sail . The storms seemed to be coming in hour cycles , but we were getting bolder and took a chance on using the forestays ' ) off and on , so we were beating back toward shore . We figured we must be somewhere on a latitude with Atlantic City , but maybe four hundred miles east . We were probably making two or three knots southwest ? which meant that we might hope for a landfall on Palm Beach , Florida , sometime early in January ! We tried to forget that , and just kept talking about what might come of our little radio program that evening . As the hour came close we all got more and more keyed up . Smitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone to be sure everything was in order . The rest of us did our best to crowd around the companionway so we could hear whatever came over the air . Finally the skipper turned on the radio , and we heard our shore station calling CGR 3070 . Then the skipper began to talk . He gave our dead-reckoning position , course , and speed , then said conditions were fairly good . When he switched over to receive , all he could hear was a voice droning away on our frequency . Whatever the voice was saying it had nothing to do with us . We tried again and again but never got any answer . All the time our transmitter kept growing weaker and weaker . Smitty tried charging the batteries again , but no hick . Our little radio program had ended ? a failure . At about 0630 on December 9th the controller at Headquarters in New Tork received a telephone call from a Coast Guard radio station on Long Island , retorting that a fairly strong message had been received on standard Coastal Picket frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that she had an " urgent message . " Unfortunately , the message itself was garbled by interference and could not be logged . A few minutes later a dispatch from the Coast Guard radio station on Block Island reported that it had received the entire message from CGR 3070 ; that it was : " Condition favorable . Three men injured . " The controller called in the plotting officers to ask their advice . What did they make of this message ? Some were skeptical . It sounded like a hoax. by should two small stations intercept such a message from a vessel well offshore when more powerful stations monitoring the same frequency had not heard any message ? If the yawl were in the area where the search had been conducted ? some hundred miles east of George 's Bank -- then her radio message should have been more clearly heard by one of the larger stations on Cape Cod or at Boston . The officers who took pride in their blue-water sailing days were quick to advance their own opinions . Everyone had taken it for granted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But unless the storm had been incredibly severe , there was every reason to believe that the yawl had started beating back toward her base under mizzen and heads ' ! . ( Nobody had reported that Zaida had lost her jigger ; it was thought merely that her sails were in bad shape . ) The chances were that she might have got off a weak message and that it had been just strong enough to reach the nearest stations ? one on Block Island , one on Long Island . Considering her last known position , as reported by H. M. S. Caldwell , and other variable factors after that report was received , she might have been beating back toward home for the past three days , Other search areas had been combed by ships and aircraft , day and night ; there could be no harm in trying to locate the lost yawl nearer her base . The controller organized a new search . Airfields were requested to alert planes returning through the Nantucket area from their dawn patrols . The Coast Guard was requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might try to contact their sister ship and give her assistance . A sturdy seagoing tug at New London was ordered out to conduct an extensive search in co-ordination with Army and Navy aircraft , which would also cover the same sector . The Naval Air Station at Lakehurst was advised to have an airship stand by with first-aid kits and packets of food and water , which might be lowered on a line or dropped by parachute . There was still another method by which the yawl might be located . If she could use her radio she could be located by radio-directionfinders . If three separate stations could report a bearing , these bearings could be plotted on a chart ? and where the three lines intersected , the yawl 's position would be indicated . The District Coast Guard Officer took charge of the plan . The yawl would be told to charge her batteries in preparation for a continued transmission at 2000 that night ; all stations in the area would keep silence and monitor the frequency , while radiodirection-finders took bearings on her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picket frequency were silent , from Massachusetts to Virginia . Nobody had thought of interference from stations as far away as Mobile , Alabama . But the radio operators who tried to pick up even the faintest word from the CGR 3070 were thwarted by the steady monotone of voices going conscientiously about their business in Mobile . That was not Me end . The same procedure was tried again on the night of December 10th . Stations as far south as Norfolk were directed to broadcast to the CGR 3070 the following message : " All stations East Coast will keep silent and listen for you to make a report at 2200 to 2215 to-night . " All stations did keep quiet . All listened . There was nothing but silence . THE day after the radio phone incident L the sea moderated so much that we decided the time had come to try out the jib as a storm trys'l on the mainmast . The worst trouble was that when the original trys'l had given way , the shackle on the main halyard had torn out and been hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it down so we could use it for hauling up the new trys ' 1 , but the weather was so rough that no one could go aloft in a bo'sun 's chair , and even George was too weak to climb the shrouds . The upshot was that we had to make a jury rig of the converted storm trys'l . Old Windsor 's job of sewing on the slides for the sail track really looked like a professional piece of work ? and as we came up into the wind and hauled up the trys ' 1 , the patches were so neat that they seemed almost ornamental . Just as we finished , and were ready to settle down on a southwesterly course , someone shouted , " Squall on the starboard beam . " At first all we could see was a smoky bank of cloud that rose several hundred feet from the ocean . Under it the water had a dark and ominous color , flecked with whitecaps . When we first saw it , it could n't have been more than four miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwest . As we all stood there staring we could hear something that sounded like the roar of breakers on the shore . Joe Choate was the first one to say anything : " That 's a damn sight more than squall . Down sail and make everything secure before she hits . " The man at the wheel brought the ship 's head up into the wind and we dropped our new trys'l in a hurry . Hands and arms round the boom , tying the furled sail fast ; plenty of stops . Down came the forestayel with a clatter and swish ; more furling , more stops . Sheets taken up , all extra lines stowed through the fo'c'sle hatch , all hatches battened down , all snugged down aloft and below . Before we had finished we could hear the wind louder , could feel the rain blown ahead like a heavy mist . Then the shrouds began to sing . The two men on watch were struggling into boots and adding oilskins over their heavy-weather gear as they kept wary eyes to windward . They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies , and bent the free ends round the stanchion in the cockpit . The rest of us climbed down into the companionway . The last look I got , the sky to le'ward was a dirty yellow , the storm area was coppery along the edges and black underneath . To the north the black was toned down by a solid gray of falling rain . I pulled the hatch in place and groped my way down to the cabin . Zaida pitched and rolled in a way that ca n't be described . All that night the gale and seas kicked us around . From the way Zaida pitched and rolled everyone knew that this was worse than what we had already gone through . We worried about the men on watch . We worried for fear the mainmast would snap off and go overboard . But there was nothing we could do . It was decided that two men would stand an hour watch together that night , and even that seemed too long . The wind steadily built up to a gale that seemed powerful enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all and ran bravely before the wind . We could tell from the sound of water along the hull that she was tearing along at the same speed she would have made with balloon sails on forestay and jibstay in good racing weather . If only she had been headed in the right direction we might have felt better ; but we were adding one more leg to our zigzag cruise ? and this leg was carrying us farther and farther out to sea , south and east . All that night and all the next morning the storm continued . By noon we began to tell one another the gale had lessened a bit , but the seas kept running in great forty-foot rollers . At one minute Zaida would be down in a trough ; then she would be picked up into the air by her taffrail until she seemed to be hanging off a clothesline ; for a second she would steady on the crest before the roller slid from under and left her briefly with her bowsprit pointing up into the scud . About 1600 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port bow r .. " . It was a new destroyer , one of our own , bearing down on us under plenty of steam . Every time she dipped , her bow buried itself in the sea and took tons of water over the for'ard deck . Then the bow rose slowly and shook the water off in great masses of white foam . At about the same time we saw a long line of freighters and tankers off the port bow ? thirty or forty of them plowing along less than three miles away . It was a convoy ; the destroyer was a part of her escort group . Good enough ! Join the Navy and see the world ! If we were taken aboard the outbound destroyer , we might see quite a piece of the world before we got back to port ! We all started shouting and laughing above the noise of the storm . WERE sure IV we would be rescued . WENobody thought anything about how we would be taken off Zaida . Even when the destroyer left the long procession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started swinging around us , she looked so large and powerfa/ that we felt she could do anything . We might have remembered how the Limey destroyer had nearly scared us to death when she bore down on us with nets over the side . But that seemed ages ago , and now we were ready to take all kinds of chances to end the long punishment . The big searchlight on the destroyer bridge began blinking at us , and the skipper called for the Aldis lamp so he could answer . We had rigged the lamp to a thirty-two-volt battery that Smitty had salvaged from our wrecked lighting system . The skipper started to signal ; but the chop and rollers kept rising so high between Zaida and the destroyer that we could n't even see her bridge at times . We kept asking the skipper what the destroyer had said , and finally he told us she wanted to know if we needed assistance . We let out whoops and bellows . The skipper waited until we were lifted high on the top of a wave and blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyer broke into such a rapid blinking that the skipper could n't read it , and asked for the message again . Wekept asking him what they said until he told us to shut up . Finally he said the destroyer had asked if we wanted to he taken off . In one voice we all turned toward the destroyer and bellowed a chorus of " Yes , yes , yes . " Of course it was silly trying to shout in that gale , but we were all too excited to think of that . The skipper blinked his answer again . For a few minutes we watched , until the destroyer had closed us enough so we could see the faces of the officers and men on the wing of the bridge ; then she changed course and fell off to le'ward . About that time our man at the wheel started shouting that we were being blown right into the course of the freighters in the convoy . The column nearest us was so widely spaced between ships that we had n't noticed how we had been gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worst part of it was that we could n't make enough leeway to keep clear . The skipper said not to worry about that the freighters could see us and would n't run us down . We were n't so sure . As we crossed astern of the first merchant vessel in the column she towered up above us like a floating city . Having seen nothing but clouds , snow , rain , and the crazy ocean for days , we had lost our sense of size . When Zaida had been everything that stood between us and Davy Jones ' Locker , she had seemed pretty important . Now she was dwarfed to the size of a museum model as these huge ships hammered their way through seas and plowed up geysers of foam and spray that fell from bow to midships . When we came close enough to see men on the le'ward rails of the freighters they stared and waved ? so we stared and waved back . It must have seemed fantastic to the men on the freighters to see us , without power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were moving , diagonally through the whole convoy formation . By the time we had moved a half-mile or so beyond the first column we came charging into the second . This time we were n't so lucky , because our course seemed to be blowing us smack up against a tanker that kept her decks more under water than out . But the tanker veered off to starboard until our courses were parallel for a time , then fell astern , and finally cut back to port and continued on course . We all started laughing when we realized we were making better time than the convoy . Someone suggested we take the convoy in tow and get the supplies to the other side that much faster . The reason for the difference in speed was clear . The convoy was taking the storm pretty much on the port beam , and that made heavy going that must have reduced speed . Then too , those great hulks sat low in the water and took the seas in solid body blows . Zaida , for all her pitching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along would come a monster wave that seemed to rise higher than the mast , while we were down in the trough . Looking aft , we could see nothing but that great wall of sea bearing down on us and threatening to bury us under hundreds of tons of cold and boiling water . The next minute we would be climbing stern-first up the side of that mountain , as though we had suddenly started going backward at a great rate of speed . Then the forward motion of the wave would pick us up and drive us ahead of it , surfboard fashion . Sometimes we would be swept forward so fast that it scared you to watch . After a few seconds the wave would sweep in under us until we were perched high on the crest . As the huge roller swept beyond the bowsprit we would drop back down into the next trough to wait for another big fellow . All this time the destroyer kept following us , dodging around the freighters and tankers , having a hard time keeping up . Somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't possibly take us aboard . The skipper told Joe what she had said , and all of a sudden we felt as though the bottom had dropped out from under us . Apparently the skipper felt the same way , because he turned to Joe Choate and said he had a mind to ask them to shoot him a line so he could be hauled aboard the destroyer and tell them just how badly off we were . It sounded like a mad thing to say , but he meant it . Joe looked at him for a second without making any answer , then said he thought the skipper 's place wasaboard Zaida with the rest of us . That made the skipper furious , and he began to protest that he did n't mean he was going to abandon us ; he wanted to take any chance if only he could make certain we could be rescued . Joe said something about its being impossible to live in seas Iike that even on the end of a life-line . So the skipper stopped talking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldis lamp and started blinking . We did n't know what he was saying and he did n't tell us . But after he had finished he told somebody to get pencil and paper from the companionway chart drawer . He had asked for our position . When the destroyer had answered , and someone had written the figures down , we were all curious to know what it amounted to . Several of us went below to see it plotted on the chart : roughly , three hundred miles east of Norfolk , Virginia ! And making about ten knots southeast , hour after hour . The skipper admitted that this was fully one hundred miles different from his own dead reckoning ; but he did n't say whether he had thought we were nearer shore or farther out to sea . At that stage it did n't make much difference . There was another message blinking across the rough waters to us ? a long one that we could n't follow entirely because the seas shut out parts of it . The skipper said nothing after it had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on the destroyer and saw her move out in a wide arc until she was steaming dead ahead on our course . She seemed to reduce speed for a while , but she was so often hidden from us that we could n't tell what she was up to . Nothing happened for about twenty minutes . All of a sudden someone in the Zaida cockpit shouted that he had seen two drums on the crest of a wave slightly forward of our starboard beam . We watched , and the two drums rose into sight and slid down into another trough about a hundred feet away . The drums were painted black and were lashed together . Although they were far enough away to he slightly to le'ward , we were already so nearly abeam of them that we could n't change our course without being capsized . Jobbie was so anxious to get a line on the drums that he offered to bend a sheet round his waist and swim for them . He had the build of a swimmer , and was so strong that he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . But the skipper and Joe insisted that it would be impossible because the yawl was making such rapid headway that the drums were already falling astern . Smitty complained that if only he had known the destroyer was going to drop the drums overboard we could have changed course gradually and could have picked them up . The worst of it was that the early winter twilight was already darkening the water . What we did n't know at the time was that the destroyer had paid out the drums full of food and water on a long line ; that she apparently could n't tell whether or not her method of sending us supplies was going to work . I do n't know why she did n't change her course until the line crossed our bow . It looked as though she swung back to le'ward of us and recovered the drums after the experiment failed . She half circled us again , trying to think up something else to do , then blinked a short message and headed back toward the convoy , already out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after Zaida had her rendezvous with the North African convoy , but many hours before the escort commander was able to report the incident ( since he was required to keep radio silence until a specified leg of his journey had been covered ) , a discouraging piece of information reached the control room at Eastern Sea Frontier Headquarters . A neutral vessel about three hundred miles north of Bermuda reported that she had sighted what appeared to be a derelict two-masted schooner . At first those who read the dispatch feared that CGR 3070 had been found , but it turned out that the derelict was a Coastal Picket which had been driven ashore at Truro , Massachusetts , on December 2d , by the same unexpected storm which had disabled Zaida , and then , after the crew had been taken off , had been swept out to sea . The plotting officers in the control room realized that if the derelict had been blown three hundred miles southeast , then Zaida might now be somewhere in the same general area . Following this line of reasoning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operating Base at Bermuda to conduct air searches in the area of the derelict schooner , in the hope of sighting CGR 3070 . Into the midst of this guesswork and circumstantial reasoning came the necessarily delayed report from the escort commander : " CGR 3070 , Latitude 37-40 , Longitude 60-50 at 1800 , December 13th . Seaworthy but in need of assistance not rendered due weather , darkness , and necessity other employment of escorts . " On December 15th a search was organized to cover a vast circle around the reported position . Nine PBPs , three B-17 's , and a fast destroyer were assigned to the search . The planes covered their assignments until they were low on fuel , returned to their various bases , and made their reports : " Conducted search to-day with , negative results . " Late that afternoon the destroyer made her report while still proceeding with the search : " Results negative . " On December 16th the same number of planes swept a new area with no better luck . Later reports indicated that some of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V r WOULD be hard to make you under-I stand how we felt aboard Zaida that night after we saw the destroyer show her fantail to us and start plowing back into the dusk after her convoy . If only the weather had been different we should n't have minded . But in that terrible gale it seemed as if something snapped in us . Yet the more we thought about it and talked to one another about it the more we decided things could be much worse . We knew that some lifeboats in the Atlantic had drifted for weeks through all kinds of cold and hunger before the survivors were picked up . By comparison we were well off . Our food was running low , but there was still enough if we were careful . Our water was brackish , and the tanks were n't very large , but we knew we could collect rainwater . And best of all , there was Zaida . She had lost her mizzen and a lot of canvas ; she had pieces of tin cans nailed over her vents ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God , she still kept sailing even without any canvas . The storms could n't keep up forever . As soon as we hit the Gulf Stream we could rig sail and work back toward shore . About December 15th we ran out of the storm , and the skies began to clear . We hoisted our makeshift trys'l and forestays'I ? and almost immediately ran out of a breeze . After all the banging and slatting we had taken from that series of storms it seemed unbelievable to find ourselves suddenly becalmed in the middle of the Gulf Stream . But the best part of it was that all of us began to catch up on sleep again . After a while a good breeze sprang up , and we set our course due west . From then on we lost track of time pretty much . The only thing that really mattered was food and water . Even underneath our beards , which had begun to get quite handsome by that time , there was plenty of indication that faces were getting thin . Smitty , who must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cruise , began to get himself stripped down to a normal size . Ward Weimer found when he took the wheel that he could n't handle it because his wrists got too painful when he put his body behind them . Some of the others found that whenever they heaved on a line their bowels would move without the slightest warning . Smitty seemed to be the only one to develop any kind of skin troubles of serious nature : boils on his arms and legs . The rest of us all had some kind of rash at times , but nothing that really bothered us . Considering the number of days we had to put up with one another , we got along fine . There were times when we would get into little arguments over the best way to do things , but the only altercation that continued day after day was the feud between Smitty and the skipper . They just rubbed each other the wrong way . For instance , there was the little incident of the revolvers . One day when the atmosphere had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something , the skipper went down to the cabin and started to clean his .38 . After all the salt water in the cabin , the revolver certainly needed cleaning . But while he was right in the middle of it , Smitty came off watch ; and when he saw what the skipper was doing he began digging into his duffel bag . Earlier in the fall , when we had been told we could n't have any more ammunition al lowance for target practice , Smitty had offered to bring aboard a AS automatic of his own and enough ammunition for limited target practice . That had been approved , and we had all taken turns blasting away at tin cans on the water . So now Smitty hauled out his .45 automatic , sat down on his bunk opposite the skipper , and went to work cleaning and oiling it . Nothing was said by anyone . A day or two later the skipper and Smitty had another argument . Shortly after they got over the worst of it , Smitty went to Joe Choate , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his weakened condition , and handed him something done up flat in a cloth . All he said was , " Hide this . I do n't want to know where it is , and I do n't want to be able to find it . " Joe knew what it was , from the weight . He hid it . VI O N DECEMBER 17Th ? fourdays after our encounter with the convoy ? we sighted a Flying Fortress . It was pretty exciting to see that enormous bird out there . We had figured that we must still be more than three hundred miles from shore , and we did n't expect to see a plane that far out . She dropped a package of supplies for us by parachute , but it hit the water so hard that the package burst open and all the supplies sank before we could reach them . We turned to look at the Fortress , but she had already started back toward land and in a couple of minutes she was out of sight . Although we were disappointed to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy with the cares of lookout and seamanship to waste much time over it . The incident just seemed to fit into the breaks of the game ? most of them against us ? and we settled down to the job of sailing westward until we could make a landfall . A spanking breeze continued throughout the night of December 17th and grew even stronger during the 18th and 19th . Earlier , we might have considered that northwesterly blow to be too much for our stick and our sail . But on this Ieg of the cruise we knew exactly how much we could do with the mainmast , how much punishment the shrouds could take . So we began leaving the trys'l and forestays'l up , day and night . Food and water worried us more than anything else . During the next few days there were several rain squalls that gave us a little water , but the ritual of the daily meal got to be more and more unpleasant . As each man would get his cupful his eyes would travel around from cup to cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Nobody said anything about it ; nobody needed to . On December 22d the weather got plenty nasty again . The wind swung round into the east , and we began beating and reaching by turns on a course that was roughly northwest . On the watch from eleven to midnight the wind seemed to be swinging round to the north . At times it would blow up to a snow squall , then moderate until the visibility improved . When Smitty came up into the cockpit that night he said , " Well , I 'm going to pick up a shore light to-night ; you watch . " That was getting to be a pretty old gag , but this time it was true . He said afterward that he saw it three or four different times before he dared to say anything about it , he had been fooled so many times . But after a while he started yelling for the others to come up and take a look . The skipper got just as excited about it as we did , until it occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sunken wreck . We thought the best thing to do would be to pull up alongside it and see if we could make fast until morning . The wind had moderated quite a bit , but there were still the rollers to make us worry about being smacked against the buoy and having a hole stove through along the waterline . The best we could do was let Zaida ride hove to and hope that we could keep paying off within sight of the buoy until daylight . Then we could decide on whether or not the color of the water and the set of the waves indicated shoals . Just then Smitty shouted , " Look ! " and pointed beyond the buoy . In the darkness , not more than a hundred yards away , we could see the dark outline of a small Patrol Boat , completely blacked out . Her course was bringing her past the buoy and astern of us . We thought for a while she was going to pass us by , for she kept on her course until she was almost out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought we were a submarine ; they deliberately moved on past so they could get set for an attack , with all guns manned and depth charges set for shallow depth explosions . It 's lucky we were n't blown out of the water for our pains . When the Patrol Boat turned back we were upwind from her and she could hear us shouting before she could see us . Smitty kept waving the feeble flashlight , trying to light up our deck and sails . He bellowed that we had been out for three weeks , that we were low on food and water , and could they give us a tow to shore . I think the skipper of the Patrol Boat was still suspicious . He shouted back that he was low on gas and could n't tow us , that we were in a danger area ( whatever that meant ) , and that we should n't go north of the buoy ; just stay hove to and wait until daylight , when they would lead us in . While we were still shouting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . It was quite a little squall , and in no time we had last sight of the Patrol Boat . Under the circumstances we could n't even be sure of keeping any position in relation to the buoy . So we jibed round and ran down-wind to get out of trouble . The farther we went the worse the wind blew . After a while we took down sail and ran before the storm again . At 0052 on the morning of December 23d the controller at Headquarters received a message from Norfolk . A Coast Guard boat on patrol near Buoy 8 in 34-50 North , 75-40 West , had sighted CGR 3070 and had found that everything was all right aboard except that she was just about out of water and supplies . There were rough seas running , heary surf on shore . The Patrol Boat had lost sight of CGR 3070 in a snow squall , but was still searching . This time Zaida must not get away . The final search was ordered . Reports began corning in long before dawn . Everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pBr out of the Naval Air Station at Norfolk , two airships out of Elizabeth City , North Carolina , two Civilian Air Patrol planes and one JRF from other fields in the vicinity . Their first reports indicated that conditions were not so good . Visibility poor , with promise of better conditions by afternoon . Noon passed without any word of success from any of the surface craft or patrol planes ; 1300 , 7400 , still nothing . At 1438 , the longawaited message came : an airship had found the yawl at 34-34 North , 75-15 West . NTH E VEN though we had lost the buoy we knew that the long ordeal was over . It was obvious that we must be fairly near land , and we expected that the Patrol Boat would find us soon after daylight . If not , so much the better : we 'd sail right into the nearest harbor without any help from anyone . All of a sudden we felt glad that the Limey destroyer had n't been able to tow us in to port , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own fate , that the big Flying Fortress had n't been a Navy duck that could land and take us off . Zaida . The idea of leaving her all to herself out in the middle of nowhere would n't have bothered us too much when we were scared stiff by the storm . But now that she had brought us safely in we all had a new love for her and felt that she had been the real heroine of our strange adventure . That last morning the sky was overcast , and rain squalls came by fits and starts . But we bad the sails set and were slogging along on what we hoped would be the last leg of our cruise . By noon the wind eased and the sun began to burn through the lifting clouds . As the visibility improved we took turns searching the horizon for the first sight of land . But the Navy and the Coast Guard did n't give us the satisfaction of making a landfall . About 1400 that afternoon one of the lookouts shouted , " Blimp , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before we could hear the steady roar of her motors ; but from the way she kept her course it seemed she had sighted us first . Before she had even started to circle us we were shouting and laughing . The tension was broken , and for the first time there were tears in our eyes and an almost hysterical tone of excitement in our voices . Before the blimp swung directly over us we were all on deck except poor Watson , who was still nursing his ribs in his bunk . Pretty soon she dropped a package of food , along with a note saying : " Your position reported . Sit tight . Help on way ? K-13 . " Then the planes began to appear ? first one , then another , and another . They came in at different altitudes , circled Zaida , dipped their wings and gunned their motors . They made a fine reception committee . We stood and gawked at them like bumpkins at a country fair . One of them nosed down and dropped another bundle of food that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , tore it open , and made a deck picnic out of it . Nobody wanted to go below for fear of Missing the fun . Within an hour we had counted nine planes and two blimps . Then the Patrol Boats came . The first to show up was a Coast Guard 83-footer that blinked a message saying she had instructions to take us aboard and put a skeleton crew on Zaida . While she was creeping up alongside , her crew began shouting at us and holding their clasped hands over their shoulders . The boys on Zaida who had been itching for a smoke asked for cigarettes ? and half-filled packs sailed across to the deck . There was a scramble to save them . The crew that came aboard to relieve us began looking Zaida over as if she were a museum piece , but we left her to their curiosity . The Patrol Boat was warped alongside , and we climbed over to the deck . The end at last , and no mistake about it this time ! Commander Eastern Sea Frontier thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport plane , he said , to bring the skipper and crew to New York on December 24th . Then make all necessary plans to be certain that each one of the crew would reach home in time to spend Christmas Day with his family . A few hours later Zaida 's crew were safely ashore at the Coast Guard Station at Ocracoke -- twenty-seven days after the start of their strange cruise . All nine were with their families for Christmas . Within a few weeks Zaida was repaired and back on station , the most famous veteran of the Coastal Picket Patrol .
