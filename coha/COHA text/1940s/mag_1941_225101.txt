The British had scarcely announced the formation of super-tough raiding forces to be known as Commandos ( TIME , Oct. 20 ) when the Commando legends began to fly . Last week London reported a wow : <P> A detachment of Canadian Commandos crossed the Channel with sealed instructions to proceed to a certain building on the French coast . The building turned out to be Le Touquet Casino , where a dance was in progress . Their mission turned out to be to capture Field Marshal Hermann Gring , carry him , if they could , to their fast boat , and take him , if he did not sink it , back to England . They entered the hall , shot all officers present , returned emptyhanded . Reason for the failure of the mission : the fat man was n't there .
