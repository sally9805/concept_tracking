The U.S. State Department last week recalled Ambassador Norman Armour from Buenos Aires . Next day , as if in explanation , it released a pointed analysis of a speech delivered on June 10 by Argentina 's War Minister Juan Domingo Pern . <P> Said the State Department : " In startling similarity ... to Mussolini , Pern wishes to dedicate Argentina to ... a warlike life . . . which will inevitably lead that country to the same tragic consequences suffered by Italy . " <P> In Argentina the effect of these moves was not conclusive . Ambassador Armour 's recall merely emphasized the fact that the Argentine Government had not enjoyed U.S. recognition since last February . Said the man-in-the-Calle-Florida : " What difference does it make ? There 's no recognition anyway . " But the simultaneous departure of the Ambassadors of Peru , Paraguay and Chile ( with others planning to follow ) was a slap in the face for Argentine militarists . <P> Pern 's June 10 speech had been little noted by Argentines , who were neither surprised nor greatly disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the State Department 's hostile analysis ( suppressed for 24 hours , then defiantly given top play in the newspapers ) worried them a bit . Protected from foreign criticism by a shield of ironbound censorship , the average Argentine had been left to believe that outsiders loved Argentina . Now , for some undisclosed reason , he was given a glimpse of the truth . <P> The real shock came not from Washington but from London : in response to U.S. urging , the British reluctantly recalled their Ambassador , Sir David Victor Kelly . Argentine nationalists have long believed that Britain was their firm , beef-eating friend , even if the U.S. was not . Ambassador Kelly 's recall , threatening joint action by Britain and the U.S. , shook this happy notion . <P> The U.S. State Department seemed to be planning some positive action in regard to Argentina , perhaps the long-rumored trade embargo . But this might be a tricky weapon . Argentines loathe outside coercion even more than they loathe their blundering militarists.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
