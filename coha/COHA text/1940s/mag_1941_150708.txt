Its first two weeks of gasoline control found much of Canada baking in a heat wave . So eager were Canadians to go driving in the evening that they did not let the closing of filling stations at 7 p.m. upset their plans . Motorists simply filled up before closing time . Between 6 and 7 the stations did a gold-rush business . <P> On the first " gasless " Sunday a steady stream of cars lined the roads ; traffic was in its normal Sunday jam . Most drivers had filled their tanks on Saturday , but some set out with drums of gasoline strapped to their luggage racks . Few drove more slowly , as the Government had asked them to do , to save gas . Many guessed wrong on the day 's consumption , abandoned their cars beside the road . Those who tried to bribe service stations to slip them a little bootleg were turned down : the rumor was out that the Government had spotters on the roads . <P> So disappointing was Oil Controller George Cottrelle 's half-way-to-rationing experiment that Canadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one last chance , one oil company advertised , urging consumers not to use its product .
