Like ants to a honey pot , the feckless of Europe flocked last week to Enghien-les-Bains , just outside Paris . There , in the white casino above the quiet lake , twelve beauties were competing for the title Miss Europe . At the first showing two were missing : bumped by Egyptian royalty from the Cairo-Paris plane , Miss Italy still sat in Rome ; Miss Austria just had n't appeared . <P> On a dais at the end of the long , red-draped , cream-colored restaurant sat the judges : Jean-Gabriel Domergue , Paris painter of nudes and titles ; the slick-haired Belgian impresario , Jean-Jacques Fortis ; and , peering recklessly through enormous horn-rimmed glasses , Marilyn Buferd , Miss America of 1946 . They were face to face with an international incident . The Stockholms-Tidningen had just demanded the elimination of platinum blonde Miss Sweden on two grounds : 1 ) she had once been elected Miss China in a Stockholm cabaret contest , and 2 ) she was n't a miss ; she was a missus , married to an Italian . Rebutted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 at Stockholm 's biggest vaudeville house , which is named ' China . ' " But the judges disqualified Miss Sweden anyway-on count No. 2 . <P> Most popular of the contestants swaying among the klieg-lighted diners was pert Jacqueline Donny of France , displaying a smartly cut bathing suit and a perfectly round navel . When the votes were in , Miss France was provisional winner . Observed Miss America ' 46 , putting away her glasses : " Miss France won by a navel . " <P> A few days later Miss France cinched the title when she met and defeated the belated Miss Italy and an ersatz Miss Austria whipped up at the last minute from a Paris fashion house . Miss Italy walked off with a consolation prize : a gallant proposal of marriage from her indignant impresario . She accepted .
