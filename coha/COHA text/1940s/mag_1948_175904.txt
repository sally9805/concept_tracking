The war of bullets did not rage as hot last week as the war of communiques . But behind the curtain of Arab and Jewish censorship , men &; women were fighting and dying . For the most part , both Jews and Arabs stayed within the partition boundaries , fixed by U.N. , but Israeli* forces captured Acre in the north , fanned out toward the Lebanese border , and attacked Arab Ramie near Tel Aviv in an effort to open the lifeline road to Jerusalem 's Jews . <P> Long Drumfire . The fiercest battle of the week was fought in the no-government's-land of Jerusalem , which U.N . had once marked for international control . <P> In the heavy-walled Old City , the fight was at close quarters . Cabled TIME Correspondent Don Burke , who was watching the Arab Legionnaires : " A drumfire from the semiautomatics goes on for long periods against a background of mortars , howitzers and heavier guns , as the Arab Legion works over the Jewish positions outside the Old City . When we arrived , the Jews inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800 square yards , undergoing a constant pounding but replying constantly with semi-automatic fire . Their main vantage points were two synagogues . <P> " In working their way through the rubble , squads of tough Arabs laid charges close to the walls of Tiferet Israel synagogue . Now Tiferet Israel resembles a Dali-like nightmare with gaping walls and smashed dome . House after house is similarly blown down or crushed in by explosives . But the Jews are still holding on despite their hopeless position . The main thing in the Jews ' favor is a labyrinth of underground passages through which they move from house to house . " <P> Sudden Change . In Tel Aviv , the air raids continued . At first , Tel Avivians had looked on the sporadic Egyptian air raids as a mildly exciting diversion . " But one afternoon last week , " cabled TIME Correspondent Eric Gibbs from Tel Aviv , " that attitude suddenly changed . High up in the blue sky , a grey-green Egyptian Spitfire ' plunged almost vertically toward the town . As it plummeted with the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving the impression that the plane was out of control . Some Tel Avivians standing in the street began to clap their hands , thinking it had been shot down . <P> " But a few seconds later the plane leveled out and the warm afternoon air shuddered with the explosion of bombs . In the screaming confusion of blood-spattered bodies and burning buses , 41 lay dead or dying , 65 wounded . From then on the raids were no joking matter . "
