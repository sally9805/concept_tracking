To chalky , dingy schoolhouses last week trudged 35 million bewildered U.S. householders to stand in impatient lines for their second ration books , to get a lesson in wartime living and the ways of Washington . <P> Few citizens admitted having more than the permitted five packages of 250-odd point-rationed frozen , canned and dried foods . Many of the rest overlooked what every grocer knew : that the previous month 's buying spree had loaded many a cupboard full up . Only one person in a thousand could remember how much coffee he had three months earlier or think of any reason at all why OPA now should hand out a maddening questionnaire with a naive entry : " Pounds of coffee owned on November 28 , 1942 , minus 1 pound for each person included in this Declaration whose age as stated on War Ration Book One is 14 years or older . " <P> An Evanston , 111. dowager demanded 17 ration books for her 17 cats . A family of three Philadelphia Main Liners declared an excess of 4,500 cans-enough to cost them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Milwaukee man had hoarded 158 Ib. of coffee , his quota for a decade . Boston ' racketeers stole householders ' food by posing as OPA inspectors come to check excess supplies . <P> Yet most of the registration was comparatively painless : the real pain came this week when point rationing began . <P> &gt; Grocers went to work in defense plants , joined the Army , or ( if they stayed in business ) gloomily predicted a 50% drop in trade . <P> &gt; Quickly housewives discovered how hard are the facts of rationing : with his 48 points a month , each civilian could buy only three or four cans . Rationing also meant a leveling of U.S. diets : upper-income groups had once eaten the bulk of the nation 's meat , low-income groups the bulk of canned goods . Now meat would soon be shared &; shared alike-and even beans ( " the poor man 's food " ) now had high point values . Precious few foods ( examples : olives , mincemeat , popcorn ) remained unrationed . Cook books , vegetable gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prized than can openers or rubies . <P> But the food situation was still less critical in the grocery than on the farm-where labor and machine shortages presaged greater troubles to come . <P> Direst of all were the words of mild-mannered Paul S. Willis , head of the Grocery Manufacturers of America : " The food predicament in this country is worse than terrifying . The Army is taking care of military food needs . The Agriculture Department is taking care of Lend-Lease . But no one is taking care of the 125 million home folks . "
