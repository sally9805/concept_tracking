txt The Administration and its Congressional leaders took today their first direct steps toward conciliating the Republican opposition to the present form and scope of the $1,450,000,000 foreign military aid program . The Senate group that has the measure in charge , an amalgamation of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees , postponed until Monday the opening of its hearings to permit consultations in the meantime for possible revisions in the present text . This course was taken by Chairman Tom Connally , Democrat , of Texas , and his principal associate in the leadership for the program , Senator Millard E. Tydings , Democrat , of Maryland , largely in deference to the views of Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan , the principal Republican spokesman on foreign affairs . It represented the beginning of efforts to placate Republicans , and some Democrats as well , and thus to put the heaviest possible bipartisan support behind the project , which is intended to help arm this country 's North Atlantic treaty associates and other non-Communist lands . Republican Objection Raised The Senate Republican campaign against Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to give aid to unspecified countries apart from those in the North Atlantic pact  --  was taken up during the day in the House Foreign Affairs Committee . While W. Averell Harriman , the roving ambassador for the European Recovery Program , was on the stand , appealing for the military assistance program as a way to " protect the growing generation from war , " he was challenged on Section 3 . Representative James G. Fulton , of Pennsylvania , with the audible support of one or two of his Republican colleagues , demanded of the Administration " an explanation in detail , an authoritative statement about this proposal . " He asserted that the bill would be a partisan measure " until and unless some Republican members are enthusiastically for it . " Mr. Harriman told the committee that he had never been so optimistic as now " that the maintenance of peace and freedom is within our reach in Europe " if this country " vigorously " goes forward with its policies , including the military assistance program . Harriman Warns of " Appeasers " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or put off action on the proposed assistance , doubts , may well arise again . The subversive elements , the appeasers , those who would trust ' neutrality , ' would rise again and have an effect on the confidence and determination which now exist . " For our own security , for the interests of our young people who have to deal with the conditions that our actions create , it is my conviction-that we should seize this opportunity to strengthen the will and ability of these nations , both to deter aggression and to reidforce them as allies . " I earnestly believe that we are winning the struggle for peace and freedom in Europe . To succeed , America must be resolute and steadfast . " Henry F. Grady , the ? United States Ambassador to Greece ; which is involved - in the aid prcigram , told the committee that , granted continued American help , the prospect for a Greek victory over the guerrillas was " the most optmistic since the inception of the program . " This was so , he said , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before as a channel and base for providing aid to me Greek guerrillas . " " Any reduction in American support to Greek operations at this time , " he added , " would have a disastrous effect upon the spirit of the army . The resulting loss of momentum in the present military effort would neutralize gains made this winter and spring and would prolong the struggle . " On the other hand , continued support would provide continuity of the present offensive efforts and would secure utilization of maximum benefits from American military aid . " Describing Administration efforts to reach bipartisan accord on the arms aid program , Senator Connally said : " We are trying in so far as is possible to meet all objections . We are trying within the scope of the bill to get as large an agreement in committee as is possible . " Mr. Vandenberg has strongly objected to the existing bill on the contention that it was so broad and controversial as to raise what he has called the " tragic " possibility that no aid at all might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Senator John Foster Dulles of New York , have taken a similar position . The joint Senate committee 's decision to withhold hearings  --  a rare decision when a bill sent up by the President is involved  --  was taken in a closed conference with Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Louis Johnson , . Secretary of Defense . Later , they called upon the President at the White House . Secretaries Acheson and Johnson , according to persons present at the Capitol meeting , gave no promise to tjae Senators to agree to any particular modification , but did agree to consider the subject of modifications . Their subordinates , the legal experts who prepared the present draft of the bill , will meet with the joint committee Friday . From this meeting might come changes in the bill . Any such alterations , Senator Connally indicated , wo , . ad be " in small particulars . " He would not elaborate . It was learned , however , that Mr. Vandenberg , in behalf of the Republicans and of some Democrats , centered objections upon Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give aid to any nation , or to any group within a nation , where he thought the security of this country would be promoted . Senator Vandenberg , it was understood , asserted vehemently to Secretary Acheson that this was the greatest grant of power ever sought by a President in peacetime , and , in effect , that , from his viewpoint , this must be the first thing to come out of the bill if it was to have a chance of passage . Apart from this issue , Mr. Vandenberg and those of like mind were said to have protested to Mr. Acheson that the program in general was Rrematurely large . This was based on the fact that the North Atlantic treaty itself , in Article 9 , provides for mutual military aid to go to members of the alliance through the recommendations of a defense council which is yet to be set up . Nevertheless , it was said in a , number of quarters , the proposed authorization of $1,450,000,000 did not itself come under heavy attack specifically , since the discussion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is standing firm for an unreduced authorization . Nothing in today 's conferences indicated any change in that position .
