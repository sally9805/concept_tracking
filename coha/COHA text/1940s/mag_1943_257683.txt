Joseph Stalin sent a new Red Army into battle this winter . Moscow communiqus and dispatches , making this fact plain last week , also told more about the Red Army 's command and methods than the outer world had ever known before . <P> Zhukov for Timoshenko . The vast reserves of men and weapons available for the Red Army 's winter offensives ( see p. 23 ) showed that the retreats of last summer and fall had been triumphs of military thrift . Stalin and the Red Army Command had sacrificed Russian cities , resources and territory rather than risk the Soviet reserves . But there was evidence that not all of the retreats were planned that way . <P> Commanders who failed have been relieved or shot . The Army 's own Red Star has repeatedly complained that the Germans still outgeneraled the Russians . Last week Moscow announced that one of its famous generals-Marshal Semion Timoshenko ( TIME , July 22 ) , commander on the southern front when the Germans broke through and drove to Stalingrad-had been replaced . <P> In his stead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was aggressive , 48-year-old Army General Gregory Zhukov , who also had much to do with planning the offensive on the central front ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) . London reported that Marshal Timoshenko was still in high favor , helping Stalin prepare a final blow against the Germans . But , in a unique communiqu , Moscow announced a long list of generals who had distinguished themselves this winter and the name of Timoshenko did not appear among them . This unprecedented list personalized the Red Army with new names , new faces ( see cuts ) like those of the Don commander , Lieut . General K. Rokossovsky , and Lieut . General M. M. Popov , one of ten officers whose troops " particularly distinguished themselves . " <P> The Big Shots . The Supreme Command of the Red Army not only plans Soviet campaigns , but directs their execution . Its representatives have responsibility for " general leadership " of the field commanders . Listed first among these representatives was General Zhukov ( with Colonel Generals Alexander Vassilevsky and N. N. Voronov ) . Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Lieut . Generals of Aviation Novikov and Talaleyev directed the Red Air Force in the southern offensives . <P> Motomechanizirovannyia . Last week the full extent of a tank revolution in the Red Army could be seen . <P> Stalin 's honors list included no less than ten tank leaders with ranks indicating that they commanded armored corps and armored armies . Previously the biggest tank organizations in the Red Army were brigades , and these usually were broken up for auxiliary service with infantry . <P> The new army 's motomechanizirovannyia chasti ( motorized , tank and mechanized units ) also include light , self-propelled 45-mm. guns , slightly larger than those on U.S. light tanks , and bigger ( 76-mm. ) mobile field guns to blast heavily defended enemy points before the tanks attack . <P> Three of the new corps received the highest honor the Red Army can give its units . They were designated " Guards Corps , " entitled to the extra pay of Russia 's elite troops .                 @ @ @ @
