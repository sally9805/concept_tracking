What does the Weather Man look like ? Most people curse him ; few visualize him . Last week , on the Du Mont Network ( Mon. - Fri. , 6:05 p.m. ) , televiewers got a good look at the Weather Man . <P> He turned out to be James Fidler , * a squarish , stocky young fellow with pleasantly twinkling eyes , carefully combed wavy hair and a professorial pointer in his hand . After a flourish of music and an announcer 's explanation of the program , Fidler appeared on the telescreen , briskly went to work on the six maps that surrounded him . <P> Then the camera 's eye fixed itself on Fidler 's wand , as it pointed to the asterisks ( snow ) , dots ( rain ) , commas ( drizzle ) and other symbols on the maps . Fidler , the U.S. Weather Bureau 's one-man radio and television department , was launching a show that he hopes to keep simple and uncluttered . His forecasts will ignore such weather map standbys as isobars ( " too confusing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offered the show to any other television station or network that wanted it . " It 's just our sort of medium , " said Chief Forecaster Francis W. Reichelderfer . " Our problem has always been to paint the weather picture in words , and . . . they do n't convey enough . " <P> *Not to be confused with Hollywood 's Radiora-cle Jimmy Fidler , no kin .
