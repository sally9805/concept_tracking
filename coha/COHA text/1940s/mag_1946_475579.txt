THE international wagon-lit of the Trans-Siberian Express was stifling as we pulled slowly out of the Vladivostok Station late one afternoon last June . So were the nine other " hard " and " soft " wooden cars hitched to the pre-World War I locomotive which was to haul them 5,800 miles from the Soviet Far East to Moscow . As the train 's speed increased , I turned to my compartment-mate , a man in a brown suit . " Shall we open the window ? " I asked . He and his male secretary , busy rearranging their baggage , looked up . " We must choose heat or dirt , " said the man in the brown suit " 1 suggest we keep our windows closed . When we wish to be cool we can sit in the corridor or walk at a station . But if you wish the window open , I will ask Victor Ivanovich to open it for us . " " Neechevn , " I shrugged , and went out to the corridor to sit down . There , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people traveling in the international car than there were berths , and that apparently no sex differentiation was observed in assigning compartments . The elite of the car included a Red Army air corps general , who immediately changed his uniform for sky blue Japanese silk pajamas ; his aide , a cheerful , talkative young lieutenant ; and a little man in acamel's-hair lounging jacket , a party functionary of undefined position . These three were the " important passengers " whom the two porters sought when a gang of hooligans flung stones at the train a few days later , smashing two windows in our car . The two worried . provodniks ? a bald , bent old man and a broad-shouldered ex-soldier ? invited them to affix their signatures and titles to a statement explaining that the damage to state property had been caused by " persons unknown " and was not due to their negligence as porters . The small man , the general , my roommate , and the colonel of engineers who moved in next door signed in that order . During the twelve-day trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment but rarely went visiting themselves , declining courteously my proffered magazines . The lieutenant 's roommate ? a buxom , middle-aged , but sprightly postmistress who was the only unescorted female in the car ? seemed to be a frequent supper guest , and several of the other officers dropped around to play cards or chess . They were all friendly enough to me in the corridor or on station platforms but did not ask me around for a chat or a glass of the general 's Japanese whiskey . The other passengers included three quiet-spoken Soviet consular officials , two youthful Red Fleet officers , a bright-eyed skilled worker from the Vladivostok shipyards traveling with his wife and child to the Caucasus on their first vacation in five years , an inspector of mines , and a family of four at the far end of the corridor . THERE was definitely more of a con-versational barrier on this trip than there had been when I had journeyed by train from Baku to Moscow in November 1943 . Then my fellow-passengers had been eager to share views with an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trucks , and to ask when the second front would be opened . But time was on my side , despite the tone of polite reserve set by the general and the party functionary . I hoped that after three or four days of travel , boredom would overcome caution ; but I made no attempt to " interview " anybody unless he appeared receptive to conversation . Toward the latter part of the trip one of the Red Fleet officers and the inspector of mines became more cordial and helped me out in good English when I was unable to translate a Russian expression , even with the help of a dictionary . The evening sky was so light that we did not need electricity until after ten . When the lights in the car were turned on , spread out copies of Amerika , the United States information Service picture magazine published in Russian , on the boxes piled in our compartment . My roommate was uninterested ; he preferred a paperbound translation of Balzac 's A Woman of Thirty rears . But his secretary gasped over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American military leaders . He pointed to the one of Eisenhower . " Very wonderful general , " he said in Russian . Then he tried in English , " General . . . very good , yes ? " I agreed . " So is Zhukov , " he said , relapsing into Russian . I agreed again . Victor Ivanovich grinned , put out his hand and grabbed mine ; we were friends . About 1:00 A.M. the old provodnik came in , pulled down the berths , and made them up with bed linen . Mine was the lower and very comfortable -- the first night . Since it was left down all the way to Moscow , it soon acquired a crinkly sprinkling of bread crumbs which were not satisfactorily covered by the thickening veneer of soot that gathered from day to day with windows closed . II r-raitE first morning I awoke early but I resolved to remain in my berth until my roommate roused himself . Not until about eleven did he roll out of bed . As we sat down to breakfast he suggested tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought us . " You have tea , " I said . " I 'll have coffee . " " No coffee , " he said . " I have tea . " " Oh , do n't you like coffee ? " " Areechevo . I have tea , " he repeated . " I have coffee . " We faced each other , the hot water cooling in our faces . " What about cocoa ? " I asked . His face brightened . " Fine , " he said , " I have cocoa up there . " He started to mount the ladder to reach some boxes piled precariously on a shelf . " Mine is right here . " . I had put my food box under the table . He pretended he did n't hear and brought his down ; we drank his cocoa . I let him get away with it . The American press would have billed it , " VICTORY FOR RUSSIA AT BREAKFAST . " Thereupon I decided on a " tough " policy ; the next morning I insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . On subsequent mornings we drank both coffee and cocoa . Tea was relegated , by mutual agreement , to supper . We went through the Alphonse-Gaston act with cigarettes . He had a dozen or more cartons of Camels with him and gave me a carton when he found out I liked them . I presented a carton of my brand to Victor Ivanovich . On that first morning while we were smoking , my roommate handed me his card -- Michael F. Ageev ( Ah-gay-eff ) , Deputy Trade Representative of the USSR in China . He said he had seen me dancing with a friend of his at a club in Shanghai . " Tell me , " Ageev said , " where did you learn Russian so very well ? " I protested . I had picked up the tourist words ? ordering , asking , complaining , buying , drinking ? on my first visit to Russia in 1935 , had studied at night school for four months in 1943 before returning to Moscow as Time-Life correspondent , and had had a little practice in Japan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmed . He wanted to know if I was " friendly " to his country , and I assured him that I was . He said he liked America . In common with most Russians I have met , Ageev admired Deanna Durbin , the American Air Force , Camel cigarettes , and United States canned goods . T THE station in Khabarovsk I wan- dered about taking pictures openly . When I joined a queue to buy a local newspaper , a policeman came up to me . He informed me that it was " forbidden to take pictures in a station without permission , " and asked to see my passport . " You will not take any more pictures in Khabarovsk , please , " he said , as he handed it back to me . " I have enough , thank you , " I replied . A few minutes later on the station platform I met one of the friends I had made on the voyage from Shanghai to Vladivostok . He was a professional figure skater and was known as " Poppa . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what had happened . " Russia has always been full of them . But they let you keep the camera ? Good . " After this skirmish with the police , returned to my Khabarovsk newspaper . The most prominent story on the foreign news page was a Tass dispatch from New York dated June 7 . It read : At the town of Columbia in Tennessee , a group of Negroes is being tried for " attempted murder " by a court whose jury is formed entirely of whites . . . . A " Committee of Justice in the State of Tennessee " under the Chairmanship of Eleanor Roosevelt has been formed . . . . Although most newspapers are ignoring the trial , the Daily Worker and the Negro press give full reports . . . . As I watched other passengers reading their papers I felt sure I would hear about this story before I reached Moscow . I did not have long to wait . Near Khabarovsk I caught my first sight of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war working along the railroad in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porter . " Why not ? " he asked . " If they had won , Russians would have had to work for them . They are not badly treated , I believe . " He left the compartment , to return holding a copy of the Khabarovsk newspaper in his big , hairy hands . " I think perhaps the Japanese war prisoners here are better treated than the Negroes in the South in America , " he said . " Is that not so ? " I explained that the two situations were not analogous . " There is another side to it , " I said , rummaging for the copy of Amerika which had a picture story on Marian Anderson . " We are guilty of much injustice to Negroes in America . But many Americans are against such discrimination . Even with the unfairness , it is possible for some talented artists such as Marian Anderson to be recognized . " He looked at the contents page and leafed through the magazine , I thought , a little suspiciously . " American propaganda ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurt . " No . Why do you say it is propaganda ? This is quite an official magazine . Therefore , it is the truth . Now if this were the Hearst press . . . " He grinned and accepted a cigarette . T HAT afternoon Ageev suggested that we try a meal in the restaurant car . A few Red Army officers were the only customers in the diner , which was buzzing with flies . We sat down at a table covered with a soiled cloth and were given a leather-encased bill of fare . We ordered black caviar , black bread , butter , beefsteak with fried potatoes , coffee , and , naturally , some vodka to go with the caviar . While we exchanged quick toasts and slow conversation in Russian , the two air force majors at the next table debated loudly whether I was English or American and finally came over to ask me . The result was a long conversation which began with differences of opinion over Korea and went on to a discussion of demobilization plans , Russian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Glubov , began interrogating me about the demobilization law in America I found my Russian vocabulary too limited for his technical questions . Without a word of warning , Ageev began translating Glubov 's questions for me in very good English . He did it so easily that I did a very slow double-take and did not realize for almost an hour that he was speaking English for the first time in my presence . His English vocabulary was so much more varied than my Russian vocabulary that I felt a trifle silly . Later on , when I complimented him on his English and chided him for not speaking it sooner , he was embarrassed . " Your Russian is fine . I like to listen to you , " he said . " I speak English so badly , my accent . . . " There were interesting differences . I learned , between the American GI Bill of Rights and the Soviet demobilization law . The Red Army soldier received a mustering-out bonus equivalent to a full year 's pay for each year in the service ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year , three months ' for two , four months ' for three , and five months ' for four years of service . Every demobilized veteran was entitled to his old job and former living quarters within a month after leaving the army . All men from fifty-five ( the top draft age ) to twenty-seven and all women had been allowed to go home , the majors informed me ? also high school and college seniors and graduates , and enlisted men who had been wounded during the Great Patriotic War . In reply to my question as to where he had gained his information about American demobilization processes , Glubov named the Britanski Soyznik ( British Ally ) , published in Russian by the British Ministry of Information . The bill for our lunch ? or dinner at that price ? came to sixty dollars , with the caviar at seven dollars per portion the most expensive item . When we had finished our coffee , the majors insisted upon ordering cognac all around . Glubov broke in on the other major 's comments on American Flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round blue eyes bored straight into mine . " What was the reaction in America to Churchill 's speech at Fulton , Missouri ? " he demanded , pronouncing Mee-scour-ee as if he thought it were three words . I explained that I had been in the Orient at the time but that I imagined the public reaction had bccn somewhat mixed . " When I read of that speech , " said Glubov , his eyes still holding mine , " I thought there would be war . I do n't want war . I want to go home . " He drew out a snapshot of his family from inside his tunic . " They were in occupied territory , " he said simply . Frezhenko , his companion , fingered his nose thoughtfully . " But maybe it was a good thing , that speech . It made us realize where we stand with certain elements . " There was a silence . Then the two majors questioned me about the rumor that American forces were fighting in Manchuria , and were relieved to know that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea ? " Glubov asked unexpectedly , like the chairman of a meeting anxious to wipe his agenda clean . Ageev , who had taken no part in the conversation except to translate occasionally , said , " Korea should have its independence . " I quickly assented . So did Frezhenko . As we shook hands and said goodbye , Glubov said , " Korea must be independent in a year or two , yes , that is so . But the people must be freed from economic slavery , from landlordism . " We adjourned , promising to meet again . T THE neat , modern railroad station at Birobidzhan in the Jewish Autonomous Region I watched a Jewish family saying farewells to a young girl wearing a Red Army uniform . Her olive drab military blouse had no epaulets , so I judged she had recently been demobilized . The girl climbed onto the coupling between the International wagon-lit and the restaurant car , arranged her boxes as a seat , and made herself as comfortable as possible . " Where are you going ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a veterinarian . During the war she had been Recruiting Officer Olga Borisevna Belikovsky . Her dark hair was braided , and she wore no make-up . " Who will pay for your education ? " I inquired . She was surprised that I could be so ignorant of such a fundamental fact . " All demobilized can go to school and the tuition is paid . And we receive a salary and clothing and food in addition . " " How much will your salary be ? " " About two hundred rubles per month ? more if my grades are better than average . " " Ah , capitalist incentive system ! " She laughed . " How can you compare it ? " she said . " Everyone receives more than enough to live . The better students , like the better workers in any organization , have the right to receive more . " The train was stopping at Bira , and Olga jumped down to stretch her stocky , cotton-clad legs . III T HE third day was especially long , monotonous , and depressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along at twenty miles an hour , halting at small villages every few hours . The Russians were getting up games of Preference ? a non-stop , four-handed card game which I can not play ; chess , at which I am a novice ; and dominoes ? a most complex version . There was a run on my stock of magazines . Poppa approached me at a station , and I gave him a handful of them to take back to his car . I was launched on a rereading of Tolstoy 's War and Peace , this time pledged not to skip or skim any of the interminable battle scenes or philosophical tracts , We ordered our midday meal from the restaurant car . The menu allowed a choice of bifshtek , fried with eggs on top , or rampshtek ? with onions . Agecv opened a case of his " London Brand " Argentine gin and urged me to drink . Despite all of his pleading , verbal cudgeling , and even sarcasm , I turned him down and drank his health in vodka . " Vodka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pouring himself half a tumbler of the ginand slicing a kolbassa roll . He picked up a piece of the sausage , inhaled its fragrance , gulped down the gin , then popped the kolbassa into his mouth . He never appeared really to enjoy drinking but was always willing to do it . A TER dinner I walked down the corridor to the vestibule , where the old Prouodnik was chopping wood into little sticks to heat his samovar . He saluted me . " It 's nice to see Americans on this car , " he said softly . " It 's been a long time . I want you to know this is a very famous car . I am fifty-nine years and four months old , and I have been working here for thirty years . The stories I can tell you about the people who have ridden in these compartments ! In 1922 or 1923 , 1 forget which year , a Chinese officer ? do you know who he is now ? Chiang Kai-slick . He had berth number nine in there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has been on this train . He is now the chief of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow . And Kalinin , the one who died , he was as old as I am nearly when he was on this train . How the peasants cheered him at the stations ! There was one time when this car was part of Vassily Konstantinovich 's special train . . " " Who was that ? " i asked . " Marshal Vassily Konstantinovich Bliicher , an old railroad man himself . He was the biggest and greatest man here in the Far East for many years . He called himself Commander in Chief and President of the Far Eastern Republic . " " What was he like ? " I gave the old man a package of cigarettes . He thanked me profusely and blessed my family . " He was a wonderful man . What a sense of humor ! How he could swear ! " I had to fetch my dictionary to get the translation of the word " swear . " The old porter went right on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broad and squat with such a little moustache here . " He put his fingers under his nose . " He defended Khabarovsk against the White Guards . " The old man shook his head . " That Bliiicher . " " Where is he now ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " He was very neat for all his roughness . But Maxim Maximovich . That 's our Gorki . You have heard of him surely ? Always with the same baggy trousers , the blue shirt , the sweater high around the neck . He had a big , long moustache , and sometimes he did not shave for days . Once before he had to speak to a meeting I shaved him . Right here in front of this samovar I shaved Maxim Maximovich . " I asked Ageev what had happened to Marshal Bfficher . " Is he in prison out here somewhere ? I remember there was a great mystery about his disappearance . " " No mystery , " he replied in English . " He went with Tukhachcvsky and that gang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know , my dear . But / do not think he is now alive . " KSENEVSKAYA next morning the sun was shining brightly . I began taking pictures around the station . Two sailors from the Soviet Pacific Fleet asked me to take a picture of them as a memento of their four years together . I assured them of my willingness to photograph them , but I had difficulty making them understand that I could not have prints ready before Moscow . As soon as the sailors moved off an eager , red-faced tank officer launched into a long story about how his tank outfit and the Americans linked up in Austria and caught the Germans in a kessel . " How do you like our country ? " " Very beautiful , " I said . " And the standard of living ? " " Neecheva , " I said , collecting my Russian for a further definition when he went on . " It 's little , I know . I have seen elsewhere . But in five years . . . " he laughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zwei , drei , vier , faref . . . it will be better . " " Stalin said so , " I said . " We say so , too , " announced the tank officer , waving his arms . " We , the soldiers , the farmers , the people . . . " At this point a burly police officer interrupted us . " Have you taken any pictures here ? " he asked . I said I had and he asked for my " documents . " He inspected my passport and my visa . The crowd around us grew silent . The policeman returned the passport and saluted . " Well , " he declared loudly , " he is a correspondent and he has a camera , so I guess it 's all right for him to take pictures . " The crowd laughed ? rather relieved , I thought . The tank officer put his arm around me and led me toward the train . " Do n't bother about fellows like that , " he said , nodding toward the policeman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You go right ahead and take pictures . The war is over . " I thanked him and we shook hands . R ex in the compartment I asked Ageev if he liked discussing politics with Americans . " Most of the time I do , " he said , " but Americans are too fond of arguing , especially about things which are fundamental . " " What things , for example ? " " Freedom of speech . Freedom of press . The scope of criticism . I hear these things over and over . " I asked Victor Ivanovich if he would n't care to show the pictures in Amerika to his six-year-old boy and his wife , who were also traveling in our car . " No , I will tell you , " he said . " They are happy to be going to Moscow . There are many things they will not have . Not yet for a while . " He smiled . " You understand ? " " The Stalin Five Year Plan will give us these things , " Ageev said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I car had begun to smell ? a combination of old plumbing , unbathed bodies , and the assorted food parcels . Our compartment was almost unbearably hot , dusty , and stuffy . Facetiously , I asked Agcev if the new Five Year Plan provided air-conditioned trains for the Trans-Siberian Railroad . His face reddened and he ground out his cigarette . He was furious , the only time he was really angry with me on the entire journey . " What for air conditioning ? " he shouted in English . " Our country needs anything on wheels . It 's perfectly all right for you Americans to talk about air conditioning . Your country has not been invaded three times within thirty years . Air conditioning . Pfui ! " He spat . After a moment he calmed down . " It is difficult for you to understand , " he said softly in Russian . " Some day I will tell you the story of my life , a hard Russian life . " " I would like to hear it , " I said . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming from the corridor , and I peered out to investigate . The tall young porter was going up and down the rose-carpeted-corridor with a glass of water clutched in his big fist . Every so often he would swig some of the water into his mouth ; then bending over , he would spray it out through his lips onto the carpet . " Makes the dust slay down , " lie explained to me , between gulping and spraying . IV T KANSK there was an encouraging signboard . It read : " To Moscow-4363 Kilometers ; To Vladivostok-4980 . " For the first time I had a secure feeling that we were inching toward our destination . just beyond Kansk I had ray first talk with Zamenchek , the inspector of mines . I told him that I had seen the largest open-face coal mine in the world in Fushun , Manchuria . At that time it had been operated by a group of Soviet engineers . The inspector questioned me concerning the production figures , the mine 's potential yield , and plans for future development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management . " The new Five Year Plan , " he said , " provides for the opening of new coal fields in Siberia which will make this area self-sufficient . No longer need we depend on the Donbas . " I asked him about present conditions in Siberian mines . " I can tell you conditions are not good . Of course , you understand they do not compare with conditions under the tsars . It is only that during the war the equipment was not repaired properly , the men worked very long hours , nobody gave enough attention to housing and sanitation and safety measures . The entire emphasis was on production . To win the war was the chief goal . Now everyone expects everything to be done at once , andwe are experiencing many difficulties . There is now a whole new system of priorities . During the war everything was planned from above by the government . Now within the big plan the month-tomonth ordering of supplies , setting dates , and methods of delivery are decided by regional boards . " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to help reorganize . The mines arc really not so poorly off . We keep a fairly close eye on the big ones from Moscow . But the factory situation is bad , especially in those which have reconverted to consumer products . " " Why ? " " Change of procedure again . When they were manufacturing war materials Moscow organized everything for them ? ordered supplies , tended to deliveries , set prices . Now they must make competitive goods of high quality . " " Competitive ? I should think the demand for consumer goods is so great that everything would sell . " " No . The state stores which are the main distributors for a certain kind of glove , as an example , will go to several factories to price them . If one factory makes a good glove for a moderate price and another a poor glove at a higher price , the first factory will get the order and the second one will be investigated . " " Is there any graft . in Soviet industry ? " Zamenchek was not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , almost none . Now some certain people are grabbing . There will have to be closer check-ups . One is going on now , in fact . " I told him that the Chinese Communists in Manchuria favored placing certain industries in the hands of private capital , beralise they felt government officials were less efficient and more apt to take " squeeze . " " That 's China , " said the inspector . " What can you expect from the Chinese ? " " You sound just like an American business man , " I told him , a little disgusted . He was pleased . ROUBLE and almost freezing weather I featured the eighth day . The trouble started before we were dressed , when the hooligans smashed the car windows and so mightily disturbed the porters . In the excitement they failed to clean up anything but the fragments of glass . A railroad inspector boarded the car shortly after noon and found both porters snoozing and the compartments full of unswept leftovers . A saucer-eyed , string bean of a fellow , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a turmoil . He lectured the two porters so loudly that everyone could hear . Scolding them roundly , he invoked the Great Patriotic War , the valor of Russian troops , and even public opinion in America . " I am told there is in your car a foreigner , an American , " he went on . " How will it be if he goes back to Washington and tells everybody that Russians live like pigs , that Russian railroads are operated by such sleeping champions ? " The inspector was somewhat mollified when the general and the Party functionary offered him a drink of Japanese whiskey and told him that the two porters actually worked very well . MHE next day at a small station I photo-I graphed peasant women selling their produce and the travelers on the top of the train . An unshaved air force captain , his collar open and his hair tousled , came up to me and said , in English : " Why do you take such pictures ? What for ? All times since we leave Vladivostok you make pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am trying to document the trip . " " Why do you make these peasant pictures , please ? " he insisted . He wore five big , round , red and gold enamel and metal medals on his tunic . " I like their faces . We rarely see pictures of Russian peasants in America . " " Why do not you take Red Army men pictures ? " A curious crowd had formed a circle around us . I told the captain that I had made pictures of Red Army men . " Do you speak French ? " he asked . " Badly . " " Oh , well . Why do you make picture about those men on train top ? " " Why not ? It is interesting . " " It is not interesting . It is very bad . That picture will appear in England , will it not , or United States ? That is very had for our country . " " ft 's the truth , is n't it ? " " It does not matter truth or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trees . Parks . You take pictures like that on train top all times since Vladivostok . I do not understand why it is so necessary for you . " " Because I am trying to show what this trip is like . Do you think it will do your country harm to have people elsewhere know that there is not enough transportation for all who want to travel ? Naturally the reason must be explained , too . Americans understand thousands of cars were lost during the war . If you give the reasons for overcrowding , what harm is there in the picture ? Do you want foreigners to believe that Russia is perfect , that you have plenty of trains ? Then when people come here , they will be disillusioned . " The captain had his mouth open as if he were catching flies . " You spoke too fast , " he said . " Will you say it later in French ? My wife is French teacher in Moscow school . She wants to meet you . " He walked away to get her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant director came around with a praise and criticism book and said she would like it if Ageev and myself , her best and most regular customers , would please inscribe a few words about the service and the food . Ageev wrote a few lines and handed the book to me . " Should I sign in English or in Rus-sian ? " " In English . To them it will look more important . " Later a letter instigated by someone in the car , probably the porters , came around for signatures . It stated that the provodniks had worked hard and well and that the undersigned were satisfied . The old man waited while we scribbled our signatures . " Moskva ! Moskva ! Moskva ! " he sighed . " Why do I love her so after all these many years ? For you young men it means pleasure , for me only more work . I must count and change all the linen , polish every centimeter of brass , especially the spittoons , clean everything , everywhere . " " Keep it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hero of Socialist Labor before you 're seventy . " " Thank you , thank you . Do n't forget , never travel on the Trans-Siberian unless you sleep in wagon 2021 . That 's this one . " He saluted and left to take the letter of commendation to the next compartment . O NE of my usual pastimes was talking to the inhabitants of the space-betweencars . When Olga , the Jewish girl from Birobidzhan , left at Krasnoyarsk , my favorite vestibule companion became a young flier , Dmitri Kusanov , from Stalinagorsk , a town " under Moscow . " After six years in the Army he was going home to be married to a prewar sweetheart named Antonia . He showed me her picture ; she had long pigtails , large breasts , and a wide smile . " She 's lovely , " I said . Dmitri grinned happily . His dirty blond hair was close-cropped , his features were big , and his face was friendly . He was wearing an oil-stained coverall , which lie was going to make into a- smock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last day of our trip he had been joined at the front of our car by a red-necked , short , bass-voiced officer without epaulets on his uniform . His name was Igor Pavelvich Muriev , and he had been a captain . When the war broke out Igor had been seventeen and a first-year student at the Kirov Institute . " I served on the Third Byelo-Russian front , " he said , reeling off , like a veteran train caller , the names of the German towns through which he had marched . " At Koenigsberg I was wounded ? shot through the head . I had three operations to save my eye . " Later Dmitri told me that Igor 's left eye had been made from a dead man 's cornea . " In May 1945 , " Igor boomed , " I was sent out to the Baikal front . That 's when we had the Germans licked . I went out on this railroad . Now I am going to Moscow . To Moscow to study history and geography , so I can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had been in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Rumania , Bulgaria , and Yugoslavia . " Life in Czechoslovakia is better than anywhere else , " he declared . " Better than in the Soviet Union except for Moscow . What avenues ! What homes ! What schools ! What lovely factories ! And what 's more , what a real appreciation they have of Russian culture as well as their own . Russian music in Prague ? Tschaikowsky , Glinka , Borodin , Moussorgsky . And the Soviet composers are not forgotten , I assure you ? Shostakovich , Prokofiev , Gliere , Khachaturian . " Dmitri wanted to know who was running the Czech government . " Did n't you read the paper ? " Igor was amazed . " The election is completed . The Communist Party is now the first party . A Communist , I forget his name , is premier . Mr. Beneg remains the president . " " A fine man , " I said , " I 've met him on several occasions . " " Well , " said Igor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think I have a chess game there . Excuse me . " He let himself out the door , swung from the steps of our car to the next one and climbed in . " This has been a hard trip for you , Dmitri , " I said . " I do not want you to think that I must ride like this , " he protested . " I was a senior lieutenant in the air force . Here , " he pulled a piece of paper out of his coverall pocket , " you see I have a first-class ticket and an order for a ' soft ' berth . But I had no priority . It was necessary to wait for one week , maybe two weeks for a place . I am in a hurry so I am standing here . " Suddenly little Igor came bouncing back . " No chess game for five minutes , " he said , in his deep bass , " and I want to ask our American companion one question . It is this : Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly . " Igor laughed harshly . " You are at best fifty per cent correct . The military war is over but the political war goes on . Look at China . Germany . Korea . Poland . Greece . Indonesia . France . Anywhere . The Czechs are all right . So are the Yugo-slays . And , of course , we Russians . But everywhere else , political war . Civil war in certain countries . Is that right ? " He did n't wait for my answer . He swung out the door again . Dmitri said , " They fixed his eye , but am not so sure about his head . Do you think he talks a little strangely ? " " No . He is probably suffering from shock , Rut his ideas are sane enough . " D mmu looked at his wrist watch , which was as big as a Mexican dollar . " Fourteen more hours to Moscow . Think ! Only fourteen more hours . Do you like to dance ? know them all ? foxtrot , waltz , polka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And the theaters ! And concerts , good concerts ! And films ! Maybe American films ! I will stay in Moscow as long as my money lasts . " lie took a hefty wad of onehundred-ruble notes out of his pocket . " Have you been robbing a bank ? " " No , that is my back pay for many , many months . " " Dmitri , seriously , what country won the war against Japan ? " " We did , " he said , promptly . " What about the United States and Great Britain and China ? " He frowned . " I am sorry , " he said . " I forgot it for the moment . Yes , of course , we all did , I did not mean the Soviet Union alone . I thought about Manchuria . " " Do most Russian soldiers understand that America fought against Japan for almost four years before Russia entered the Pacific war ? " " Oh , yes , " he said , but he did n't sound certain . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the islands . But we really came into contact with the main part of the Japanese army . " He paused . " That is right , is it not ? " I made an attempt to summarize the various phases of the war against Japan . When I had finished , Dmitri said : " If all that you have spoken is truth , I have not understood completely perhaps . But let me ask you , how many Americans or Englishmen understand completely the role of the Russian people in the war against Hitlerite Germany ? " " Many of them do . Perhaps not completely . It is difficult for people three thousand or more miles away to understand completely . I think too many of us have already forgotten what your country suffered in loss of men , homes , industry , and resources . " " I am glad you are honest . I would like to go to America with Antonia . Only to visit . Is there more to see and do in New York than in Moscow ? " To any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost inconceivable that any place could be more glamorous , more modern , more wonderful , more amazing than Moscow . When you tell them about New York , they listen politely but inside they are sure you are bragging , that you are trying to run down Moscow . An Illinois dirt farmer might feel the same way about Chicago if he had never seen any other big city . Moscow , however , is more than a big city : it is the capital of all the Soviet Republics , the capital of Communism , the capital of the Russian Orthodox Church , the capital of Russian culture . It is metropolis and Mecca rolled into one . NOBODY in the car slept much that last night .. Hidden stores of vodka and gin appeared from packing cases . The mounting excitement which always develops at the end of a long journey bubbled around the exploding point . Victor Ivanovich had an excellent tenor voice . Over and over again he led them in singing " My Moscow . " He insisted that I learn the chorus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we dozed off with our clothes on . At 5:00 A.M. the old provodnik made the rounds , pounding on doors , crying : " Moskva skoro , Moskva skoro ( Moscow soon ) , " although the train was not due to arrive until ten . He repeated this Paul Revere act in a half hour and then every fifteen minutes until the entire car was roused and fully dressed . At 6:00 Ant. , about seventy-five miles from Moscow , the train stopped and an electric engine replaced the locomotive . Ageev , Victor Ivanovich , and I prepared an elaborate feast for our final breakfast . When it was over , I said to them : " For twelve days I have not asked you many questions about your feelings and your opinions . Now , before we part , I would like to ask your advice about one thing . " " O.K. " Ageev said . Victor Ivanovich nodded . " I ask you this as my friends , not because you , Michael , arc a Soviet government representative . I want your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most important single thing for Americans to know about your country . What single fact will help them understand you ? " There was a long silence . Finally Ageev spoke . " As a correspondent you must ask that question of our top leaders . You must ask Generalissimo Stalin or Foreign Minister Molotov . " Victor Ivanovich heartily backed him up . " I do n't want their opinion now . I want what you and Victor Ivanovich think as Soviet citizens . I do n't want you to tell me what you think their opinions would be either . I want yours . This is nothing official . " Ageev grasped it . He pondered , chewing on his lower lip and fingering his moustache . " All right , " he said finally . " Americans say Russia is spreading Communism in China . This is not the truth . Americans must know this and understand . " I wrote down what he had said and turned to Victor Ivanovich . He was gazing abstractedly out of the window . " What about you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I am a worker . An electrician by trade . I can not decide such things . " I argued with him . But he was stubborn and he steadfastly refused . Etarrr the porters went up and down the corridor , pausing in front of every compartment to ask , " Are you packed ? Are you ready ? Moskva skoro ! " The villages and towns close to Moscow had an air of permanence which made them differ from their counterparts in Siberia . The forests were no longer virgin . New wooden houses and barns and new fences were everywhere . The skyline changed . Each town had a recognizable old church turret . At Zagorsk there were several of the familiar onion bulb towers . During the last hour and a half we sped through dozens of suburban stations packed with patient people waiting for their commuters ' trains . It might have been Westchester , but not one was reading the Herald Tribune . I left the window to say goodbye to a few of the passengers in the car . Zamenchek , the inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You asked me questions about housing . I will try to find out for you , and I will telephone you . " We shook hands . The general was standing by his window putting his uniform on over his Japanese pajamas . The young flier , Dmitri , had changed into a clean uniform . " Can I show you Moscow , or do you have friends there ? " he asked . I wrote out my address and said I hoped he would get in touch with me . I sent my love to Antonia and also a small coral and silver pin I had bought in Peking . " Give this to her from an American . It is a wedding present . " Dmitri stared at the pin for a moment . I had the feeling he would refuse it . But he did n't . Instead he threw his arms around me and squeezed me . " It is really much too beautiful , " he said . " Not fur Antonia . " He grinned . GAVE the porters a half dozen cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a tip . They thanked me and before I was out of earshot the old man turned to the young one and said , " You understand now ? I told you all Americans were gentlemen . " Noses were pressed against the windows as we reached Moscow . The last ten minutes seemed like ten hours . At last we pulled in ; I could hear a collective sigh . Ageev was met by a delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Trade . He shook hands and gave me his telephone number . " We will drink together again . Maybe you can learn how , you are young yet , " He thanked me for my companionship . Victor Ivanovich helped me to get my bags down . He was the last person I shook hands with . The last thing he said was : " About your question . I have been thinking very hard . As a Russian worker , I have to tell you this : the most important fact for Americans to know about the Russian people is that we want to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I stepped off , told me that the Trans-Siberian Express had not arrived in Moscow on schedule . We were three minutes early ,
