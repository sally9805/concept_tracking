Washington was charming in its Christmas wrapping . But around the Capitol and the buildings of state the charm was only brick-deep . <P> Congressmen , who habitually put off all thoughts of legislation with the first glimpse of holly , were again scrambling to get home for the holidays-no matter what kind of a mess they might be leaving . <P> And a mess it was : of the 22 recommendations Harry Truman had made since September 6 , only four had been acted upon . They were 1 ) the Government Reorganization Bill , 2 ) a much-watered-down version of the Full Employment Bill , 3 ) extension of the War Powers Act ( by the House only ) , 4 ) return of the U.S. Employment Service to state administration by mid-April , 1946 ( the President had wanted to keep control of USES until June 30 , 1947 ) . <P> Pigeon-holed in committee , tied up in Congressional snafu or put off until next year were : <P> All atomic bomb legislation , including the controversial May-Johnson bill . <P> All labor legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards and cooling-off periods . All military legislation , including universal training and merger of the services . <P> Congress had also ducked its responsibilities on jobless pay , minimum wages , fair employment practices , small business and scientific research . <P> The premise of early New Deal days that Congress exists merely to echo the executive 's orders had long ago been discarded . Congress has taken a healthy interest in debate . But the methods of controlling the debate , of channeling and guiding legislation , of bringing order out of the normal Congressional chaos seemed to have broken down . Too many Congressmen frankly took the view that Harry Truman did not mean everything he said and that therefore all his proposals did not need serious attention . And in Congress itself the Democratic leadership , uncertain of its aims , had broken down . It could be stopped or beaten by almost any coalition - and almost always was .
