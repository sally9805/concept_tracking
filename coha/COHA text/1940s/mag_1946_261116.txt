Almost every morning since last November , a long-shanked , ruddy-faced man carrying a geologist 's pick has stomped his hobnailed boots through the lobby of Mexico City 's Hotel Geneve . Every evening he has returned , dusty or muddy , frequently carrying a heavy bag . The hotel 's turistas speak of him as " The Prospector . " <P> But Dr. Hellmut de Terra , a geologist turned archaeologist , is not after gold , but bones and stones . In the last 15 years he has carried his pick over much of the world 's surface on the trail of prehistoric man . Dr. de Terra 's current quarry is the late Ice Age in central Mexico . <P> Mammoth in the Bull Ring . The existence of human life in the southwestern U.S. during the late glacial period was confirmed in 1927 with the discovery at Folsom , N.M . of chipped stone " Folsom points " between the fossilized ribs of an extinct bison . Ever since , archaeologists speculated whether " Folsom man , " following the herds of bison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shred of evidence that he might have was a fossilized mammoth tusk turned up last summer in the excavation for Mexico City 's new bull ring . The tusk bore a deep incision which , said the archaeologists , might well have been made by human hands . <P> Dr. de Terra picked up the scent last November . He made his first strike in an area that he had not considered promising : a handful of stone artifacts-scrapers , drills and flaked stones-projecting from the eroded wall of a ravine near Teotihuacan , northeast of Mexico City . With this unexpected encouragement , he went to Tequixquiac , a spot known to be rich in fossilized remains of animals . Dr. de Terra hoped this would yield traces of hunters as well . <P> There he found what he was looking for : bone tools and stone artifacts , exposed along the sidewall of a deep trench which carries Mexico City 's sewage to the lowlands . According to Dr. de Terra , the soil in which the bones and stones were found was formed under a chill and rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincided with the last great glacial period in North America . <P> But Dr. de Terra hopes for better evidence . In April he will study the steep slopes of Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl ( pronounced Po-po-ca-tay-petal and Eesta-see-wattle ) , the peaks hanging over the Valley of Mexico . He believes that the valley was covered by a high-level lake during the prehistoric rainy spell . If this is true , there should be beach formations high up on the slopes , and Dr. de Terra may find more proof of human activity in Mexico 's Ice Age .
