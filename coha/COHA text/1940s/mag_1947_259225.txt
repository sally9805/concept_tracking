No one savored the power of office more than Andrew J. May of Kentucky . As wartime chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee , he reveled in having generals at his beck &; call . If a " warm friend " or a good constituent wanted a favor ( perhaps a war contract , perhaps a son sent to O.C.S. ) , Andy would pick up a phone , summon the official to his office , and arrange it on the spot . <P> But last summer , when the Senate War Investigating Committee began to rummage through the shadowy Garsson munitions empire , it turned up evidence that May had gotten something more tangible than pleasure out of his wartime career . There was talk of packets of $1,000 and $3,000 sent him from the Garsson 's Washington office . There was the peculiar circumstance that May had endorsed a check as president of the Cumberland Lumber Co. , which the Garssons paid for lumber which was never delivered or even cut . <P> Andy blustered that it was a political smear , suffered a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , home . He was defeated for reelection . <P> Last week a District of Columbia federal grand jury returned indictments charging May , his " warm friends " Murray and Henry Garsson , and the Garsson 's Washington business agent Joseph F. Freeman , with conspiring to defraud the Government . May was accused of accepting $16,000 in checks and cash from the Garssons and arranging for the payment <P> of $53,634 more . He hurried to Washington , pleaded not guilty , and declared himself confident of vindication . But 71-year-old Andy May was a changed man . Required to post a $2,000 bond , the man who used to keep generals jumping asked the clerk humbly : " My heart is hurting me-can I sign something and go to my hotel ? "
