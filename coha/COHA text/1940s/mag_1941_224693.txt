Last week New York City 's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia emitted an angry Donald Duck squawk . Subject : U. S. draft boards . " The trouble with the administration of the draft in New York City , " quacked the Little Flower , " is n't in Washington . It 's in the laundry . I think someone is using too much starch in the shirts of the administration . " <P> What drove the blood to Mayor La-Guardia 's head was the refusal of some draft boards to defer his carefully selected and trained policemen and firemen as essential employes . The Mayor might further have observed that not only is many a draft board 's shirt front stiff , but that no two boards wear the same size shirt . Some of New York City 's 280 local boards deferred policemen and firemen while others did not . Some gave deferment to such " necessary " workers as the manager of a meat store , an executive of a firm making babies ' bonnets , the manager of a retail linoleum store , an advertising production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board gave occupational deferments to an average of one in 191 registrants ; another deferred one in 18 . Meanwhile Colonel Arthur V. McDermott , supervisor of the New York City area , instructed his boards to consider deferments even for men married after registration day , unless it could be shown that they went to the altar to escape the Army . <P> What was true of New York City was true of the rest of the 6,253 draft districts from Bar Harbor to San Luis Obispo . Told to administer the draft and grant deferments as they saw fit , no two boards saw eye to eye . In Los Angeles , a board placed Cinemactor James Stewart in Class I-B ( for limited service ) because he was ten pounds underweight . ( Jimmy Stewart , weight 145 , declared he wanted to serve . ) In Chicago , a husky named Len Weiner was drafted although ( at 245 Ib. ) he was well over Army weight standards . <P> Even more vexed and vexing was the question of deferment for dependency . Last month in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the intent of his committee was to defer men for dependency , not for marriage . Yet in Washington itself only seven or eight draft boards followed this principle , ordered draftees to service if their wives were selfsupporting . The other 17 or 18 held that homes should not be broken up in peacetime , deferred married men somewhat on the pattern ordered for the New York City boards . In Cleveland , Ohio , the Cuyahoga County Board of Appeals heard the stories of 14 married men , ruled that thirteen of them must serve because their wives were selfsupporting . In Evansville , Ind . draft boards followed a similar plan , but differed among themselves on what self-support is . Some held that $600 a year was enough to make a wife selfsupporting , a few put the figure as high as $1,200.
