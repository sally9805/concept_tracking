EVERY day in New York City thousands of man- hours of free entertainment are enjoyed by people standing along the rivers or looking out of the windows of tall buildings , watching the hurly , gaudy little tugboats handling their huge tows , churning the water with their furious screws and shooting the clear air full of sharp white toots . The connoisseurs among tugboat watchers know that for a small tug to handle two twelve-car railroad floats while the current dashes one way and the wind another  --  and this in the midst of the heavy river traffic  --  is very much the same as shooting a four-cushion billiard in a drafty building that is being shaken by a passing train . It is axiomatic among steamship skippers that New York tugboatmen are the most skillful in the world . From the tugboatman 's point of view , working in New York Harbor is strictly tugging in the big time . New York Harbor means to him what the Palace did to a juggler or the Polo Grounds to Alibi Ike . In the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the point of departure for 60 per cent of the seagoing tonnage leaving this country . Yet this fantastic traffic , each ship of which has to be docked and undocked by tugs , is only one part of the harbor 's life . Rivers , and beautifully navigable ones , run through the Greater New York area , with its 11,690,000 people , like veins through your hand . And through them travel the goods and commodities that nourish and sustain this fabulous honeycomb of packed , stacked , teeming life . Stupendous tonnages of everything from doomed and lowing cattle to bottled beer and cheese are transported by barge over these waterways , barges that were , perhaps , loaded in Boston or Beaumont , Biloxi or Brooklyn . Suppose all the 200-odd tugs handling this traffic should quit work at once . Back in the late 30 's , that 's just what they did , and there was a colossal mess . Among other things , the Queen Mary was inbound from Europe , carrying thousands of passengers . Here , ? was a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loaded , both because they had engagements ashore and to keep them from eating poor old Cunard out of house and home . Yet there were no tugs to dock this greatest of all liners , which had always before required a dozen tugs to warp her into her berth . The captain resolved to try it anyway , brought his ship up the river at dead slack tide and did dock her . True , he mashed a several-thousand-dollar wrinkle in the pier , but that was negligible . It was a great display of skill and guts . But since we got into the war , there have been no tug strikes . Astronomical tonnages have been handled daily , and the tugboat people have worked , at times , till their eyes crossed and their legs bowed , but they 've kept right on tugging till the job gut dune . Like any normal person , I have always pined to ride on a working tugboat . The other morning at four o'clock , at the 30th Street pier in Brooklyn , I went aboard the Moran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had something of the aspect of a purposeful duck , to share in its problems and joys throughout the day . At this time she was inhabited only by the night engineer and her captain , Archie Evans , who was up in his tiny cabin , asleep . The night engineer was , I could see through the grillwork flooring over the fireroom , raking out ashes and gold and coral coals . Everything out on deck was dripping with dew , so I wandered into the engine room , which was all spanking green and silver paintwork and gleaming polished brass . Here were the whopping cylinder heads , and through the grillwork deck below I could see the Richard J. 's really handsome innards and the nickel-plated piston rods which could drive her screw with the power of seven 100-horse teams . At 4:30 the cook came aboard with a sack of groceries . Soon he set out on the table a plate of Danish pastry rings and some coffee in a white enamel percolator , the little glass dome of which was missing . Than Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jack had a face like the picture of a plump Roman on a bent coin . Barney Scherer , the mate , showed up next . Barney was the size of a bear . He had a big , loose face , and his nose just wandered around . Other fellows , seven in all , came aboard . Al Peterson , the engineer , looked like the president of the school board in a town of 2000 population . Barney explained over coffee that our first job would be to undock the ship just across the slip . It was a Liberty loaded down almost out of sight and with her decks covered with boxcars . After we got her out in the stream and turned her loose , we 'd go through Buttermilk Channel to Hunt 's Point , in the Bronx , to bring down a loaded collier . Barney went on deck , where he yelled over and asked the Liberty ship if they were ready to go . A voice said yes , and you wondered where they were going and would they get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , would have been willing to bet on it . When the Richard J. moved over alongside the Liberty , Captain Evans appeared from somewhere and climbed up a wooden ladder , which Jack held for him , and went aboard the freighter to direct the undocking job from her bridge . 27 Barney took the Richard J. under the stern of the Liberty and , sticking halfway out of the pilothouse window , yelled , " Hey , Mister Mate , will you put out that stern light ? It 's liable to blind people . " Jack threw a heaving line up over the Liberty 's stern , and they hauled up our towing line . By now , Barney was out on the top of the housing aft , where there was a steering wheel like the braking wheel on top of a boxcar . There were signal lines leading to the engine-room hells and also a whistle cord . When we heard Captain Evans ' whistle signal , Barney repeated it on our steam whistle , signaled Al down in the engine room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look out for that hosser , Jack ! " Our towing hawser had fallen down over one side of the tug 's stern , and Barney knew that when it tightened it was going to snap in place . " I 'm watching it ! " Jack yelled , and ran . A second later , that rope shot across the deck with a noise like thunder . Had it hit Jack , it would have broken his back . The slip was so crowded with ships and lighters that there was barely room for the big Liberty to pass through . But we got her sliding nice . Captain Evans was doing a job that nervous people ought n't to . At the end of the slip , the ebbing tide was racing by . It would catch the Liberty 's stern and try to carry it downstream while the rest of the ship was still in the slip . If the river had its way now , it would twist the ship around so fast that her bow would collide with the pier on the left side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans whistled for us to haul it upstream against the huge and plangent force of the current . And just in case we had n't understood , a voice on the Liberty ship said , " He said pull ' er up the crick . " Barney blew three toots on the whistle and signaled Al to hook her up . Our screw started plowing up the river . Now we were really tugging , and Barney ran to the pilothouse to continue his job from there . The Richard J. was vibrating heavily from the thrust of her pistons . You could almost hear the old thing grunt . But we were licking that current , and , as we hauled upstream on the stern , another tug was ramming its mossy nose against the Liberty 's bow and pushing downstream . Now the ship was swinging just right , and , fifteen minutes after we had gone to work , we had Captain Evans back on hoard , had retrieved our lines from the freighter , and had switched off our two lights to announce to the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the collier . The cook rang the breakfast bell at 6:05 , but . I hung around up in the pilothouse with ( Continued on Page 94 ) 91. frightened by anybody she knew , and she was n't frightened now . " Hello , Teller . " " Hello , " he answered . He was standing hooked to the low limb of a tree by one arm with his ankles crossed , and he had been watching her for some time . " Lost , ai n't ye ? " " Not specially , " said Tibby . " I 'm not in a hurry to get anywheres . " " Heading for Yocum 's ? " " Yes , I guess so . " " That 's why I waited . I could of cleared off and you would n't never of seen me . " " Sure , you could . But why would you ? Scared of having somebody just lay eyes on you ? " " You said it , " answered Teller with a scowl . " I would n't let anybody see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the kind has more sense in her head as ever comes out through her mouth . " " I 'm tired , " said Tibby , seating herself on the flat root of the tree . He took it as an invitation and slid down to sit half facing her . " You got looks and all the rest besides , but that ai n't why I waited . I wanted to warn ye to lay off Yocum 's and the woods beyond . They ai n't healthy . Look what happened to Meg . " " When ? " asked Tibby , startled . " What ? " Teller smiled . " So Nath ai n't bothered to tell ye ! Somebody caught her in Ox-head Woods one week gone and busted her up for fair . She ai n't been out since . " " You ' ? Was it you , Teller ? " " Heck , no . If it was me , would I be risking my hide to warn ye off ? " " That 's silly . You are n't risking a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play dumb ? This war wo n't last forever , and if I do n't hear of it until it 's over , where 's the harm ? " " Oh , " said Tibby , catching her breath . " You could be working , " she added quickly . " It 's people that work that help the people that go . " He grinned at her . " What about them as buys bonds ? Do n't they help ? " He dragged out a roll and began peeling off bills . " Do me a favor ' ? " " What ' ? " she asked , stricken by the sight of so much money . " First time you 're up to Phil ly buy me half a dozen fifty-dollar bonds . Here 's enough cash and ten extra for your trouble . " TUGGING IN THE BIG TIME ( Contiti.rd fror. l'opt. 27 " ) Barney while the captain and those not busy at the moment , but who might soon be , ate breakfast . The pilothouse had somewhat the same feeling as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Captain Evans ' license , which showed that he was qualified to handle vessels of unlimited tonnage in New York Harbor or adjacent waters . Barney 's license said he was qualified to handle anything up to 500 tons , which made him eligible to be a tugboat skipper . Barney said Evans was a good man to work for ; not all the time yelling when things got tight . Capt . Archie Evans was a tall , consciously polite , intelligent man . But he was like so many boat and ship captains , in that you very frequently felt that in speaking to him or by looking at him you were intruding upon his privacy , as if , perhaps , the only time he was entirely comfortable was when he was alone . After Captain Evans had breakfasted , Barney and I went , and had pink grapefruit with each section neatly cut out and wholly vulnerable to the spoon . Then we had farina , eggs and fried ham loaf and March 24,1943 " Oh , I could n't ! " He seized her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was in for a fight , but before she could move , much less speak , he was on his feet and away from her . " Sure you can , " he said , as smooth as butter , " and keep your mouth shut , to boot . Bring ' em here any Sunday morning , and by that time happen I 'll want some more . Did n't you say it was up to me to help ? What about you ? If you have n't got the grit to do your share , just quit picking on me or anybody else . " " Why could n't I buy them in Salem ? " she asked , weakening . " Aw , use your bean , " said Teller disgustedly . " Want everybody hounding to know where Tibby Rinton got the money ? Up to Philly nobody would care . " " Just this once , " she decided finally . She fished out the bills , divided them and packed them methodically into her shoes , flat as an inner sole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teller . " Only a sharp one would of thought of that ! " She rose . " I guess I better go now . " " This way , " said Teller . I t ' 11 save all of a mile . " They descended to the sharp bank of a run . Indifferent to wetting his trousers , he stepped into the muddy water , and when he turned , his shoulders were on a level with her thighs . He locked one arm around her legs above the knees and lifted her so easily that she might have been standing on a platform . His strength and the touch of his bare arm on her flesh combined to send such a thrill through her that she was breathing harder than he when he set her down on the far side . " There you are , " he said . " Follow straight through till you hit a path , then turn right . Afore you know it , you 'll break into the lane . " " Thanks , " she murmured , lifting her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He caught her elbows lightly and laughed down at her . " Yeah ? Then what about paying ? " " How much ' ? " she asked . " Only one  --  like this ! " She had been kissed often before , and by more than one boy , but Teller 's kiss was different . Though it had n't lasted long , it followed her like a whip , driving her so fast along the trail that she stumbled more than once . ( TO BI CONTINUED ) coffee . Tug people have to eat things like ham loaf because it is n't rationed . While fishing-boat people get extra rations because of the taxing nature of their work , tugboat people do not . " Them buzzards say we ai n't essential , " Barney said in ever-new astonishment and indignation . " Ai n't a gun or a man left here by sea that was n't hauled by a tug . Maybe yez can figure it . I ca n't . " Back in the pilothouse after breakfast , Barney took over from the captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get a little sleep . In the blue-gray dawn over Manhattan , a single light was burning near the top of the Chrysler Building . Though the tide was running fiercely against us , we planned to bring the collier through the Gate at slack tide . The Gate is the tug people 's name for that most dangerous part of the river which lies between the Hell Gate and Triborough Bridges . Here the currents are at their wildest and most unpredictable , and rocks line both sides of the river . In the old days , almost as a matter of ritual , pilots drank a pint of rum before attempting to take a schooner through the Gate . By eight o'clock , the radio telephone in the back of the pilothouse had begun going , ordering specific tugs to this or that docking or towing job . As we came to the confluence of the Harlem and East rivers , we saw fog drifting along in an almost solid wall . We were into it before we realized its appalling density . Over his shoulder Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cappie stirred and said , " You can still see the shore line , ca n't you ? " When Barney said no , that brought Captain Evans into the pilothouse . We went ahead slowly , navigating by nothing except a distant bell sound . We were lost when the captain woke up , so he had no means by which to orient himself . Then , for a moment , a piece of the upper works of the Triborough Bridge loomed , dim and cathedrales. que , high in the distance . We felt our way on . tooting as we went . A little later we got a glimpse of Hell Gate Bridge , and then everything was blotted out . We were lost again in the most perilous spot on one of the world 's most heavily traveled rivers . Captain Evans was very quiet and calm . He leaned out of the pilothouse window and , talking in a very soft voice , said , " Keep a sharp lookout down there in the bow , Jackie . " The currents had the boat doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of wild ducks , close enough to kill them with a stick . They rose and flew away , quacking . I kept wondering when we were going to wash into the rocks . Captain Evans tried to keep her going as slowly as was possible and yet retain control of her . Except when Captain Evans blew our whistle , there was absolute silence in the pilothouse . We strained our ears for the lapping of water against the bow of a barge that might be bearing down on us . I did n't know it at the time , because this was no time for questions , 95 but Captain Evans was also listening to something else . He 'd been hitting the banks with his whistle , and was navigating by echo . Barney , feeling that I might not fully appreciate our position , very quietly explained , " If you bang into the shore here , you stay here . " Suddenly Jack yelled , " Here 's the shore , over on the left ! " and there , fifty feet away , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , what we beheld was a small tanker tied up in front of the Ward 's Island Sewage Treatment Station , which looked like a modern post office . We got a line across to the disposal vessel , hung on , and , despite the want of sweetness in the air , we could not have been happier had she been the presidential yacht . By now , the radio told us , people were having trouble with the weather all up and down the river , Soon a lot of touting began approaching out of the fog , and a large tug sandwiched between two railroad floats materialized , barely avoided a collision with another tug and its tow , and finally managed to tie up beside one of the disposal ships . As this was being done , I fell into conversation with our cook . He had had a piece of bad luck the morning before . Moran allots him a dollar a day per man for groceries . Yesterday , after he had had the day 's supplies delivered to the pier , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had to work all morning with no coffee and nothing to gnaw on but " hosser " ends . But today there was lunch , built around a nice roast loin of pork , and while we ate it Barney told me that back in the old sailing-ship days , and even later , tug crews worked on shares , and the first tug to reach the vessel got the job of bringing her in . Tugs cruised well outside the harbor , searching for tows , and if several tugs saw a ship at the same time , there was often a great battering scrimmage to see who would get to her first . Frequently , when two tugs were in cahoots , one tug would run interference for the other against a third tug , and fights were anything but infrequent . Nowadays , however , each shipping company contracts with a certain towing company to handle its vessels . I asked about the money part of tug-boating , and was told that tugs , which cost about $150,000 apiece , fetch the company twenty-one dollars an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men aboard them work by the day . For an eight-hour day , Jack gets $5.30 and Barney $7.11 , but , as Barney pointed out , " There ai n't any more eight-hour days . " The boat has , on occasion , worked forty-five hours straight . Overtime is time and a half . The chief engineer makes $8.45 and the captain $8.80 . " This ai n't a high-paid business , " Jack said . " You really got to like the water . " " You need to be born in it , " Barney said . " Take most of the fellows in it . Water runs way back in their families . " Yet , despite this background of water , Barney and Jack seldom used such terms as " starboard " or " port , " and now and again referred to the deck as the floor . Not until three o'clock did the fog clear sufficiently for us to go on up the river . We put our lines aboard the collier , and , acting as if we were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the channel . Once we got her there , the collier set her own screw to turning , and we and our relative , the Marian Moran , slipped up on either side of her beam , put a line aboard and let her drag us down the river . Since we were off schedule , the current now was fast and adverse , and in case there should be trouble in the Gate , we were all set to supply whatever lateral pressures were needed . As we made our approach , a loaded Liberty ship swung in ahead of us . A tug with four barges in tow was passing us on our left . Captain Evans , aboard the collier , had her screw turning as fast as he could without running down the Liberty ship . He was holding her firm and well on course as we slid into the violent crosscurrents at the Gate , I could feel them shaking and twisting and somehow bouncing the Richard . Barney held our rudder at ten degrees left and stood ready to ram our big bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , figuring each of the component elements in this delicate navigation problem  --  elements such as tide , crosscurrents , wind , ness , that is the highest accolade . We ate supper at four o'clock on the way down and were soon all back at our various stations to be admired by the tug watchers along the Manhattan side of the East River and , on occasion , to be vociferously cheered by a large collection of medium-sized children . For , although the Richard J. was built during the first World War , she gets several coats of bright red paint once a year , her trim touched up every six months , and she was a pretty bonny sight . By five o'clock we were down below the Statue of Liberty , where we retrieved our captain and our lines from the collier and sent her on alone . Because we could not get in communication with the office by radio , we went to the city pier , where there was a telephone in a shanty , and a fire hydrant where we could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock to tie up to . This made Barney furious . He said La Guardia had had the cleats removed to keep the tugs from tying up there and wearing out his dock . Then we got word that we were through for the day . We 'd worked only a little more than twelve hours , the shortest day the Richard had had in a month . As we chugged back toward the 30th Street pier , I remembered that sad Al Peterson had said , " After thirty years of tugboating , there just are n't any thrills left in it . " But for Captain Evans and Barney , and especially for Jack , I knew that tug-boating was an exciting business : the continual contest with wind and tide , a performer 's sense of being in the swim . They know that every tow they handle is worth thousands of dollars , and that tows worth millions are commonplace . They know they are important in the general scheme of things , and can and do comport themselves with dignity . They are not mere summertime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the mercury hangs at zero and the boat is infrecoe nf from n om men o n tchoe , rishipse o f t ha et covered with ice . They know the thrill of they handle , hot and glamorous m rivimnatgi earth . They know that they have a finger on the pulse of the big outside world and a respected place in the dazzling inside world of the harbor that bustles and toots and gets things done .
