From the land that was once Ethiopia and is now part of Italian East Africa , Italy up to last week had launched two drives into British colonies-one southward into Kenya , the other westward into the Sudan . Neither had got very far last week when Italy launched a third-into British Somaliland . <P> That torrid little country ( see map ) is about the size of Missouri . Its capital , Berbera , is on the coast but has no port facilities . It has a municipal water system but no railway , no bank , no hotel . A coast road connects it through the secondary " port " of Zeila with Djibouti in French Somaliland which fell into Italy 's hands in June . <P> British Somaliland looks and feels like a cross between the Montana badlands and Death Valley . Except in the mountains near the coast , which rise as high as 6,500 ft. in a wall behind Berbera , it rains only 2 inches per year . In July and August a hot , dry monsoon blows from the blazing Ethiopian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dense dry " bush " and tough desert fodder to keep alive the nomadic natives ' herds of sheep , goats , camels , ostriches . <P> The only use Italy has for such a land is to threaten Britain 's hold on the southern entrance to the Red Sea and the route to the Orient , a hold otherwise confined to the port of Aden across the Gulf and the island of Perim in the strait called Bab el Mandeb ( " gate to the mandate " ) . To defend Somaliland , Britain had the Camel Corps , originally formed by British Marine officers to hunt Mohammed bin Abdullah , the " Mad Mullah " who for 20 years ( 1900-20 ) carried on a religious revolt until R. A. F. bombing planes drove him into Ethiopia . Chief gain for Italy in driving Britain from Somaliland would be prestige among the Arab peoples . <P> It appeared that Britain had only the Somaliland Camel Corps on guard in Somaliland last week . It is composed of one camel company , one pony company , one mechanized company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officered by Britons . Total with reserves : about 560 men . Beside these stood another 560 native mounted police with rifles , machine guns , British officers . Their leader was Lieut . Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater , oldtime desert fighter . Governor and Commander in Chief of the protectorate is Vincent Goncalves Glenday , 49 , an Oxonian sportsman careerist in Britain 's colonial service . <P> Against them moved Prince Amadeo di Savoia , Duke of Aosta , a lank , leathery , 42-year-old veteran of Italy 's colonial service . Under his command were some 21,000 Savoy Grenadiers , seven legions of askaris* and a reserve of some 70,000 semi-trained labor troops . For the Somaliland venture he had ample aircraft , tanks , armored trucks and mobile light artillery for three mobile columns , sandy coastal plain from Djibouti to Zeila . The other two , crossing the border by the road east from Harar and Giggiga , struck at Hargeisa and Oadweina-shack towns used by herdsmen and caravans as watering and market places .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
