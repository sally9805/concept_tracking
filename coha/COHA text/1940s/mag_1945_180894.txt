It was a trying day for the brand-new Lady Rothermere . Bewitching in the rose straw hat the Duchess of Westminster had brought her from Paris , she gave a party at the Dorchester to hear the election returns - and the news was a Labor sweep . Almost worse was the arrival of Lady Diana Duff Cooper , fresh from Paris , wearing an exact duplicate of the rose straw . <P> Fleet Street took a longer view . Hats and elections could come &; go , but was this pretty , vivacious , 32-year-old woman about to rewrite a chapter of British news paper history ? Her fondest hope had be come common knowledge : to spur her 47-year-old husband 's Daily Mail back into the all but lost struggle with Lord Beaverbrook 's Daily Express , and win the top in the mass circulation field . <P> <P> Right &; Left . When she was the wife of Lord Shane O'Neill , she would scarcely have been interested . She was busy making the rounds of English country houses , romping on the Riviera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann O'Neill had a mind of her own , and sometimes it got her into trouble . " I thrive , " she told friends , " on my antagonisms . " <P> Gloomy Esmond Cecil Harmsworth , second Viscount Rothermere , found her delightful . After he divorced his first wife , she became his weekend party hostess at Mereworth Castle in Kent . <P> She also induced Lord Rothermere to tilt his nose a little more toward the grindstone . After his father 's death in 1940 he began showing up at Northcliffe House at 10 in the morning , stayed till after 6 at night . The policy of the Daily Mail , which had been friendly to fascism in his father 's time , supported the anti-fascist war , at times seemed hostile to the U.S. , wobbled along apparently undecided whether to go right or left . <P> Night &; Day . Eight months after Lieut . Colonel Lord O'Neill died leading a regiment in Italy , his widow became Lady Rothermere . Now Fleet Street generally agrees that the Daily Mail is being run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an advisory nighttime board at the Dorchester . Politicians consider the Dorchester directorate important enough to court . <P> Lady Rothermere is not always discreet about the things she hears at her private board meetings . Confidential information given Esmond at the Mail office often finds its way about town . But despite these lapses , Lady Rothermere keeps her eye on the main job-building Rothermere into a better Beaverbrook . <P> In the final analysis her dream depends on Lord Rothermere 's willingness to hustle . Shy ( except when making a speech ) , he has never shown any real interest in the routine details of the business , never covered a fire or managed a department . He can write well when he wants to , has occasionally done first-rate editorials . But mostly he has just sat on the top dais , expressing his likes &; dislikes . <P> Right now the daily trips to the office are becoming more &; more irksome . He is longing to get away from the job , to travel , study , read . Whether he does or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of . For the moment that is under Lady Rothermere 's hat .
