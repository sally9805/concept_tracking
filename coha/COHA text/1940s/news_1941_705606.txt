txt Tree Girdles Held Worthless Every year in May trees of all varieties in the vicinity of New York ars girdled with bands of cotton . The owners will explain that they are trying to keep the leaves of such trees from being 3aten by the " tent-caterpillar " worms which have left tent nests in the cherry trees and are crawling across country in a horde . But their cotton bands are not protecting the leaves at all , either this year or next . For the worm does not leave the cherry tree until it has completed its eating for the year and is ready to spin its cocoon within twenty-four or forty-eight hours , and if it climbs a tree its only threat for the current year is that its cocoon will be attached to such a tree . Nor is it threatening the tree it climbs with a crop of worms for the next year , because it turns into a butterfly , mates and invariably flies a considerable distance across country before it scents a cherry or possibly an apple tree and lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the next crop of worms will appear .
