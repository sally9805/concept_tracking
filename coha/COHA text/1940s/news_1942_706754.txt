txt Almost every one concerned has been trying to explain away the statement made in Washington last week by the Finnish Minister , Hjalmar Procope , that Finland " wants to cease fighting as soon as the threat to her existence has been averted and guarantees obtained for her lasting security . " In Helsinki , Foreign Minister Witting asserted that reports that Finland is seeking a separate peace are without foundation . In London the rumor was authoritatively " discounted . " Persons close to Mr. Procop ? let it be known that what he hoped to convey was that Finland was not carrying on war as a willing ally of Nazi Germany but solely in self-defense . Of course , the whole story is not in these disclaimers . The Finns are not defending their boundaries as these existed in 1941 . They have advanced to , and a little beyond , the boundaries existing before Russia attacked them in 1939 . The Nazis have tried to get them to cut the Murmansk railroad , a main supply route for United Nations goods going into Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of the Finnish armies , as saying that his ambitions included Karelia in a " Greater Finland . " Karelia , practically speaking , is just another name for the Murmansk railroad . Though Mannerheim has been on good enough terms with Hitler to receive a visit from him in June and return it in July , he denied any such aspiration . There has recently been some activity along the Finnish front , but it is a fact , as Mr. Procopd said , that the lines have stayed for ten months " practically unchanged . " There can be no lack of American sympathy with the Finnish people in their terrible predicament . We applauded them enthusiastically in 1939 and 1940 , when they were fighting the same enemy they are fighting now . Britain and France came near sending an expeditionary force to help them . They saw Latvia , Estonia and Lithuania come first under Russian control , then ravaged by the Nazi armies . They could have chosen to remain aloof . This would have been the wiser choice . Had they done so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer Finnish lives would have been lost in a futile war , more Finnish liberties would have been lost at home . The wiser choice was at best a frightful one . The Finnish nationalists apparently still think in terms of boundaries and sovereignty . The reality of the world situation is that no small nation can exist independently at this moment in a contested zone . Sweden and Switzerland are deceptive exceptions , for each I would be ruled by the Nazis if Hitler won and each must be guaranteed , when Hitler is overthrown , by some power or league external to itself . If the whole world is not free no small country , and no great nation , either , will be free . We may hope that Russia will be wise enough after the war willingly to restore the boundaries of 1939 . There is reason for her to do so , since they were forcibly altered to improve Russian defenses against Germany , and if we secure the right kind of peace Germany will never again be a menace to Russia or any other country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
