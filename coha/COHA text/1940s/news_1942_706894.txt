txt AS OPA GAS RULING WENT INTO EFFECT ' JERE Holder of a " B " ration book is turned down by a station attendant . The New York Tames Confusion , Defiance Greet New ' Gas ' Restrictions Here The first day of the most drastic gasoline restrictions ever ordered in this country brought confusion to the metropolitan area yesterday , bitter recriminations from spokesmen for gasoline dealer groups , but little noticeable reduction in the number of passenger cars on the streets . Most of the confusion and some of the bitterness stemmed from the word " emergency , " as applied to the exceptions under which holders of A , B or C ration books might obtain gasoline under the Office of Price Administration order temporarily denying fuel to all but commercial operators , who have T coupons . Some of the confusion was cleared up after Sylvan L. Joseph , OPA regional administrator , issued , at 4 P. M. , the following clarifying statement : " Emergency is defined as any car , bound on a necessary trip , which can not reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may secure a onecoupon transfer of gasoline . This includes all professional trips by doctors and nurses , all essential occupational travel such as war workers , airplane spotters , etc. , if I they do not have sufficient gasoline in their tanks to complete their essential travel . " Driving for pleasure or convenience is completely suspended . " The OPA , in addition to forbidding gasoline dealers to sell gasoline even to emergency drivers if they already had three gallons in their tanks , also sought to place on the dealers the responsibility for determining whether the motorist 's emergency claim was genuine . In virtual defiance of the government , Sol A. Herzog , counsel for the Eastern States Gasoline Dealers Conference , said that deallers " are going to honor coupons when they are presented , and // NEWEST ' GAS ' CURB CAUSES CONFUSION // they 're not going to inquire into the honesty of a claimed emergency . " Charging the OPA with " trying to pass the buck to the gasoline dealers , " Mr. Herzog asserted that the retailers would refuse to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tank to find out if it contained three or more gallons of gasoline . An early test of the issue was promised as 100 OPA investigators , took to the field from New York City district offices in the after , noon to enforce the limitation order in the city , on Long Island and in Westchester ane rtockland counties . When the district OPA offices closed for the night none of the investigators had reported back . A spokesman said that any violations they may have found would be reported to Mr. Currie today . The first reported arrest of a motorist , who sought to purchase gasoline after the emergency order went into effect , took place in Weehawken , N. J. A man described as John Cosgrove , 41 years old , a newspaper pressman , of 217 Shippen Street , Weehawken , drove to a gasoline station at Palisade Avenue and Thirty-second Street , Weehawken , presented a coupon and asked for gasoline . According to the police , he continued to insist upon getting gasoline after the attendant had explained he was not entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by the attendant , said he then explained the order to the motorist , who continued to insist upon getting gasoline . The patrolman finally ordered Cosgrove to get into his car and ' move on . " Cosgrove refused , it is alleged , whereupon he was arrested on charges of being a dis : orderly person and resisting arrest . He was paroled in Weehawken police court . Mr. Herzog declared last night that all the resources of the conference , which he said represented 60,000 of the 80,000 dealers still in business along the East Coast , would be placed behind the first gasoline dealer to be tried for alleged violation of the emergency order , which applies to sixteen States and the District of Columbia . Declaring the conference had " not lifted a finger " so far to defend any retailer accused of OPA. violations , Mr. Herzog said the new situation called for " a fight to the finish . " Mr. Herzog said ? before word came from Washington that the emergency restrictions might be lifted by tomorrow midnight , with a reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons ? that 40,000 gasoline retailers would be forced out of business in the East if the restriction on B book holders remained in force for twenty or thirty days . Spokesmen for other retailer groups , on Long Island and in New Jersey , also criticized the restriction on B books as an OPA " mistake , " but their statements were more moderate than Mr. Herzog 's . An emergency meeting of the Gasoline Merchants of Brooklyn and Queens , Inc. , was called for Monday night by Louis Kimmel , business manager , who said : " The gas station owners are ready to do everything possible to help the government in its war effort . However , we feel that this latest order is too drastic at this time . We hope it is only temporary and will be lifted shortly . It is a colossal mistake . I do n't see any objection to freezing A coupons held by pleasure car owners , but it is dangerous to freeze B and C coupons . Many B and C holders use their cars for business . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Gasoline Dealers Conference , said the emergency measure " again puts the dealer on the spot " and repeated an invitation to Federal authorities to call in gasoline retailer representatives for the drafting of future rationing orders . The OPA emergency order , which became effective at noon , had as its aim the immobilization of most of the 7,000,000 passenger cars in the ** of them in this city  --  until gasoline reserve stocks , described as critically short here , could be built up to a safer margin . In New York City , at any rate , apparently there was little immobilization yesterday , except for official cars , the use of which was reducec. further by the Police , Health and Sanitation Departments . Traffic policemen at Times Square and at other busy sections said that motor traffic was about the same as during the previous few days . One reason advanced for the lack of any apparent reduction in traffic yesterday was the fact that most drivers who would use their cars already had them out of the garage before the full extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Petroleum Administrator Ickes had appealed to all motorists yesterday to keep their cars in their garages unless it was absolutely necessary to use them . In disregard of the Mayor 's appeal to buy no more gasoline until further notice , motorists es used " gasoline runs " at many stations during the morning . There long lines of cars , reminiscent of scenes during the early Summer shortage before gasoline rationing went into ei , : ect . By afternoon the lines had vanished . Tanks ran dry before noon at filling stations in some parts of the city and in some of the suaurbs . At La Guardia Field word concerning the emergency order spread about 11:30 A. M .. and hundreds of workers wheeled their cars into queues at the airport 's three gasoline stations . Those served before noon got as much as their coupons warranted , but at the stroke of noon attendants refused to pump any more gasoline into automobile tanks . Mr. Ickes conferred with Mayor La Guardia at City Hall yesterday morning , but declined to comment on the OPA order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . " Mr. La Guardia told the Petroleum Administrator that he had ordered all city-owned passenger cars out of service . The Mayor told reporters he would look into complaints about taxicab drivers who leave motors of their cabs running while parked . " I call it waste , " the Mayor said . The Mayor said he favored a plan whereby the rationing of gasoline should be a function of the administrator who has control of production . Police Commissioner Valentine said that if the Police Department ' is requested to do so it will enforce the OPA. order . He also issued special orders freezing 227 departmental cars , including his own , in garages . One result was that many high officials , including Assistant Chief Inspector John J. Ryan , in command of all detectives , came to headquarters by subway . Commissioner Valentine did not answer a question as to how he came to work . The Department of Hospitals directed that no gasoline was to be put itno any of its vehicles except ambulances and such emergency cars as carry food , medical supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-essential cars returned to garages , and division superintendents made their duty tours on refuse trucks . Heads of war factories , especially the New England and Long Island aircraft plants to which thousands of workers travel considerable distances by automobile , flooded OPA offices with queries about the status of their workers .
