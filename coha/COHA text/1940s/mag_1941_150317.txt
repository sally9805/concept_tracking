( See Cover ) <P> Last week Sir Percy Noble was aware that he was losing the Battle of the Atlantic . Up to him was the question of whether it could be lost slowly enough so that the tide of battle could turn before Britain was beaten . <P> The British Admiralty announced last week that it will no longer publish weekly figures of the British merchant marine 's losses-henceforth they will be issued only monthly . The reason for the change was partly to keep the Germans from knowing how effective particular attacks had been . But if the change was also made partly for reasons of home morale , it was an ominous sign . For the weekly report of merchant-tonnage losses has been the best barometer of how the war was going for Britain , and every Briton knows that although his country may survive disasters in the Mediterranean , it can not survive losing the Battle of the Atlantic . <P> The chart below shows how British shipping losses have piled up since the beginning of the war ( not counting the shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total through the end of March was 5,300,000 tons ) . What this rate of losses means is best explained by the tally of what shipping Britain now has . <P> How Much Left . When the war broke out , Britain had about 21,000,000 tons of shipping in all categories , and has since acquired about 9,000,000 tons of Allied and neutral shipping . Meanwhile Britain has built , bought , chartered and captured an additional 3,000,000 tons-a grand total of 33,000,000 . Deducting 5,300,000 tons lost , Britain has at present available a grand total of 27,700,000 . <P> This fine , fat , encouraging figure is misleading . For one thing , a large proportion of this tonnage is impounded by the Admiralty and requisitioned for military purposes : transport of troops , supply of the Mediterranean campaigns , armed merchant-cruising with convoys . Besides , much of the tonnage is unsuitable for the task of supplying Britain : some ships are inland water vessels , others were used before the war for the trans-Channel trade . Much of the tonnage of big passenger liners is not usable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not leave in distant parts of the world . According to London estimates , all these factors reduce tonnage which can actually be used to carry life-stuffs and death-stuffs to Britain to 13,000,000 . <P> Nor is that all . Voyages are slower , owing to the fact that convoys must assume the speed of their slowest members and must steer in zigzag courses . On the average , voyages take twice as long as they did before the war . So these 13,000,000 tons of shipping carry roughly only as much goods as 6,500,000 tons could carry in peacetime . <P> Nor is that all . Of all the British ports , only Liverpool and those on the Clyde and Severn-lying on the western side of Britain-are operating at anywhere near full efficiency . Edinburgh , Newcastle , Hull , London and Southampton , thanks primarily to U-boat concentrations and to a lesser extent to the Luftwaffe 's awful flirtations , are decreasingly effective ( in the order named ) . The ports , in short , are bottlenecks which reduce the effective use of the merchant fleet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
