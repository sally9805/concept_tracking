The long red carpet which Denver 's historic Brown Palace Hotel spreads for the feet of royalty was unrolled at the front door one day last week . A curious woman asked , " Who are you expecting ? " A bellhop grinned , said , " A $50,000 bull . " Snapped the woman : " You do n't have to be nasty . " A few minutes later a $50,000 bull named T. T. Regent lumbered out of a truck , waddled up the red rug , was triumphantly installed in a pen in the lobby . <P> A similar performance by a second $50,000 bull , T. T. Triumphant 29th , was canceled at the last minute . T. T. Triumphant was indisposed , stayed behind at his veterinarian 's orders . But a prize calf , sent as a substitute , plodded up the red rug as his representative . <P> Cattlemen , crowded into Denver for the 1945 National Western Livestock Show , saw nothing at all unusual in this procedure . Both bulls were white-faced Herefords , the predominant Western beef strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest price ever paid for a U.S. beef animal-the T.T.s Triumphant and Regent had hung up a mark for stockmen to shoot at . <P> Ever since the Ralph Smith Farms of Chillicothe , Mo . bought an Aberdeen-Angus bull for a record $40,000 last March , the American Hereford Association had hoped for high-priced bidding on Herefords at Denver . But few would have bet that such a fabulous price could be topped , even in a boom year . <P> For raising the bulls that topped the Angus mark , Herefordmen had a Westerner to thank-Dan Thornton of Gunnison , Colo. , who took home a total of $200,000 from cattle sales . Motorman Edward F. Fisher of Detroit and Banker Richard C. Riggs of Catonsville , Md. bid $50,000 . <P> Hereford raisers had reason to hope that the mark would be broken again next year . In the closing minutes of the auction , Bob Lazear , manager of the Wyoming Hereford Ranch at Cheyenne , Wyo. , received the most fabulous offer yet-$100,000 for W. H. R. Helmsman III , judged top bull of the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Lazear was of no mind to set a record : he turned down the offer . Said he : " I would n't know what to do with $100,000 , but I know what to do with a bull . "
