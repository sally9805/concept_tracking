If the materials are to be had , the average man can once more build all the new houses or buy all the new bathrooms he can afford , " on time . " <P> But the heady days of a few dollars down and a few cents a month for everything from garages to garbage cans are still a long way off ; controls over installment buying in general are due to outlast reconversion . Reason : Regulation W was instituted on Sept. 1 , 1941 , as an anti-inflationary measure . And FRB fears that inflation would blow prices sky high if unlimited credit is permitted before supply meets the demand . <P> Nevertheless , lending institutions last week scrambled furiously to get themselves ready for installment buyers when the lid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashing to an alltime low the interest rates to dealers for financing autos . Commercial Credit Co. , C.I.T. Financial Corp . and General Motors Acceptance Corp . announced a drop from a prewar 4% to 3% .
