Gangster films , the Municipal Council decreed last week , could no longer be shown in Kuala Lumpur , the Malay capital . The Malaya sector of the Communist campaign for Southeast Asia was heating up so rapidly that the Kuala Lumpur city fathers decided that they had best call a halt on Hollywood terror . <P> The desperate , quality of the Malaya fighting was brought out in the struggle between two war heroes , Billy Stafford and Lau Yew . Billy Stafford had helped organize Burmese resistance to the Japs . Fifteen times he parachuted into the jungles on secret missions . Recently , he organized in Malaya what he calls a " killers squad " to fight Communists . Malayan Chinese call Billy Tlh Sau-pah , the Iron Broom . On one of his recent raids , Stafford was after Lau Yew , a Chinese who was once Billy 's comrade in arms in the fight against the Japanese . The British considered Leader Lau Yew such a hero that they flew him to London for the 1946 victory celebration . Later Lau Yew became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killers squad " on their search for Lau Yew , cabled the following report : <P> " Toward dawn our guide led us to the rim of a deep hollow , blanketed with yellow kunai grass . At the bottom were three dilapidated board shacks , before one of which a woman puttered over her morning chores . As Stafford led the squad crawling down into the hollow , the woman glanced up and shrieked . Three armed men burst from the house and fled for an opposite hill . <P> " A sharp volley of police carbine fire brought down the foremost runner . The last man then turned and filled the valley with the blood-tingling screams of the terrorists as he wildly emptied his Luger in our direction . Two detectives , firing at close range , pumped 15 shots into him . His head was nearly severed from his neck when he fell . <P> " The police rounded up the third man and handcuffed him along with six women and another man found in the house . We were just about to leave when the whole hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , and rifles firing in rapid bursts . Bullets spat in the dirt and sizzled through the grass . Two hand grenades exploded , as a third bounced harmlessly on the ground . <P> " Hugging the ground , we crawled back up into the kunai grass on our hill and started returning the fire . Seizing the opportunity for a bluff , Stafford yelled out ' Here come Gurkhas ! Here comes the army ! ' His men took up the cry and moved forward in a counterattack , blasting with carbines and Tommy guns . The Communists vanished back into the hills . Five of the six handcuffed women , caught in the murderous crossfire , lay crumpled on the ground . <P> " The man killed first , the one with his neck almost cut off , turned out to be Lau Yew .
