Work for the BBC closely resembles a love affair with an elephant : the pleasure is nil , the danger of being crushed to pieces extreme , and in any case no results can be expected for nine years. * <P> This characterization of the British Broadcasting Corp . appeared in Claud Cockburn 's leftist London newsletter , The Week . British radio listeners might quarrel with it but few of them would deny that something ought to be done about civil-servantish BBC . Last week , as the time for renewal of BBC 's Government charter neared , British voices spoke up and said so . BBC countered with what amounted to a top-drawer shakeup . <P> BBC listeners had special reasons for speaking up . Unlike Americans , who get their radio programs free , over nine million British radio owners pay ten shillings apiece yearly for the privilege of listening to their only broadcasting system . For their money they get the product of a semi-government monopoly which England 's pinko New Statesman &; Nation terms " the usual British compromise between incompatibles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clause so elastic that the Minister can always disclaim control of BBC-BBC is theoretically not controlled by the Government . It is theoretically not a private monopoly , either , but a public corporation chartered by Parliament . BBC can therefore , theoretically , avoid the fixed opinion of public , the commercialization of private monopolies . The result of this compromise between white and black is occasionally brilliant , usually a monotonous grey . <P> Timid Monopoly . Minister of Information Brendan Bracken remarked on this depressing shade recently in the House of Commons , invited " a complete examination of the whole setup of the BBC " before renewing its charter . Commons adjourned without committing itself , but the solid , thoughtful Economist snapped up Bracken 's invitation . Said the Economist : <P> " The great vice of the BBC is timidity . The BBC is a monopoly , but it is in the opposite position to the traditional monopolist . It can not defy the public ; just because it is fair game for everybody , it can not afford to offend anyone . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vices that might be expected from a state-run cultural institution . It should not be blamed ; it is doing its best . . . . <P> " If the test of a broadcasting system is the excellence of its programs , the prescription should be not more public control , but less . . . . To continue with the present system would be to condemn broadcasting to the fate that would have attended the press if , from its birth , it had been nationalized , or the stage if there had never been more than two or three state theaters , or art if the only commissions were those to be obtained from public bodies . There will be no excellence with out competition . . . . The virtues of American broadcasting are not due to its advertising sponsorship . . . so much as to the fact of competition . . . .
