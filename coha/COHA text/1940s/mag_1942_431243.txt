 | There must have been rainy , chilly Fourths of July in my boyhood years ; but I can not seem to remember them except as blistering , sweltering days . It would n't have seemed like the Fourth if the mercury had been below eighty-five . The celebration began early . No sooner had the sun shown himself above the horizon than the first enterprising patriot started the fracas by setting off a giant firecracker . This lifted the citizenry three inches from their seats and set the domestic fauna ? Bessie the fox terrier and Blackie the cat ? scooting underneath the bed , to remain there the rest of the day . Pretty soon householders could be seen in their shirt sleeves out on their front stoops running up the flag . Everyone hoisted the flag on the Fourth . On other patriotic holidays people might not be so meticulous ; but on the Fourth there was scarcely a house but vaunted Old Glory in some form , ranging from elegant banners that rippled in the breeze , if any , to tiny affairs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . After breakfast little boys could be seen popping eagerly out of houses , each boy equipped with a piece of punk and a supply of firecrackers and followed by maternal injunctions : " Georgie , you be careful , , now . Remember what I told you ? do n't you set off any of those things near the house . " You lit a bunch of the crackers ? they were innocuous , tiny things , not good for a hundredth part of the noise you could get from a torpedo or a giant firecracker ? and then threw them at little girls . ( " Georgie Roberts , you stop-pit ! I 'm going right in and tell your mother . " And from Mother : " Young man , what did I tell you ? Now you march right into the house and stay there the rest of the ? all right , then , you stop bothering Elaine . Now I 'm warning you ? if I have to speak to you again ! " ) In the morning , usually , the exercises were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The band from the mill played Sousa marches and patriotic tunes off key , or the highschool fife-and-drum corps tootled . The most promising young orator from the previous month 's highschool graduating class read the Declaration . Or perhaps , crazed with success , he tried to recite it from memory and forgot the words before he was halfway through . Sometimes the main address was given by the county judge , sometimes the state senator from the district . Or perhaps the congressman . Less frequently a real , live , honest-to-goodness United States senator . And how he laid it on ! How he made the eagle scream , and swoop , and flap his wings , and soar ! I can see him now ? the orator of the day , not the eagle ? ruddy . and moist from the exuberance of his own verbosity ( to recoin an old phrase ) , in a black frock coat , boiled shirt , wilted collar , and chaste blacksatin bow tie . And frequently pausing to mop his brow with a huge bandanna fished from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broiled contentedly . ( " He 's a real good speaker , ai n't he ? " " Sure is . He sure can lay it on fancy . " ) By midafternoon the sun had wilted the town and there was a drowsy lull in the festivities . Except at the Fair Grounds , where there was a baseball game between teams from the foundry and the silk mill , or the Elks and the K. of C. Maybe there was a clambake out at the Grove . Trolleys crowded with the younger set droned and creaked their way to the Lake , where there was dancing at the Casino . Some of the faster crowd even knew how to dance that newfangled dido called the Bunny Hug . Maybe @#  | there was a circus in town to complete the holiday bliss of the local Tom Sawyers . At some time during the sultry afternoon there was sure to be a thunderstorm , drenching dotted-Swiss frocks and curling new straw hats , but bringing a little relief from the heat . ( " Rain cooled it off real nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly needed it . " ) Then , in the evening , the grand climax ? the fireworks , with Papa as master of ceremonies and official igniter and every kid in the neighborhood assisting . The display varied in splendor according to Papa 's ducats . As hors d'oeuvres there were pinwheels . You stuck them onto a tree , lit the fuse with a piece of punk , and then ran like blazes . The pinwheel revolved feebly two or three times , sighed , and collapsed . You then approached it cautiously , in the face of protests from the voice of authority : " Georgie , keep away from that thing , you hear me ? Let it alone before you get hurt ! " And just as you were about to light it again , the perverse contraption came to life with an indignant sputter and began whirling like a teetotum , sending off gratifying showers of sparks . Then Papa took the more elaborate items to the nearest vacant lot , and the real fun began . Roman candles and rockets , glorious golden comets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , burst with a soft plopping sound , and then rained down in a shower of coruscating , fiery jewels . Or perhaps the village fathers went to town and threw a civic display of fireworks in the Park , with the climax a set piece showing Old Glory rippling in fire or the three dauntless heroes of the noted " Spirit of 76 " tableau . Then the rockets grew fewer and the popping of the firecrackers more fitful . As the normal summer-night stillness crept back to the town , the dog and the cat crept out from under the bed . " Georgie , do you realize what time it is ? " said the voice of authority . You tottered drowsily to bed ? and just made it , too ? and the next thing you knew , it was the fifth of July .
