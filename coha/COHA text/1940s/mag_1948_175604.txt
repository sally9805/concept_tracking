In the sandbagged capital of San Jos , a Communist named Manuel Mora was the strong man last week . That was about the most significant result of four weeks of civil war in Costa Rica . <P> Well-armed rebels , fighting to give rightist Otilio Ulate the presidency to which he was elected last February , sat high in their southern mountains and beat off clumsy government attacks . In San Jos , leftist President Teodoro Picado and ex-President Rafael Caldern Guardia , the men who had provoked the war by getting Ulate 's election annulled as fraudulent , had found they could not control Comrade Mora ; they had wooed him too long and too earnestly . Their police and troops , weakened by losses in the field , were nothing compared to his 1,500 well-disciplined shock troops . <P> President Picado , a feckless figurehead in a bright red shirt , was cooped up in the red-roofed Casa Presidencial . It was smart , stocky , 39-year-old Manuel Mora , leader of the Communist Vanguardia Popular , who ran things from the Bella Vista fortress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his men in command of a government battalion which was moving against the rebels from coastal Playa Dominical . His forces had control of United Fruit banana plantations on the Pacific Coast , and were burning and looting . When Archbishop Victor Manuel Sanabria crossed the lines to bring a compromise proposal to the rebels , it was Communist Mora who furnished him protection . <P> During the week , Mora visited the Casa Presidencial to discuss strategy with Picado and Caldern , rode to La Sabana airport to inspect supplies arriving from Nicaragua , Mexico and the Dominican Republic , made speeches all over town . But each day he included a visit to the same small cottage on the edge of San Jos . Manuel Mora is a single man . " I was too poor to get married , " he says . " Anyway , I would n't want to ask a wife to share the kind of life I lead . " Daily he brought his problems to grey-haired Carmen Lyra , a writer of children 's books , who sat in her book-lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mora has followed for years . <P> Mora , the moody , humorless son of a carpenter , has fought all his life . He had to struggle to get his lawyer 's education . Since 1932 , he has fought in Congress for a Communist program . Now , in the civil war , he has his chance to put it over . To do so , he is prepared to turn the rebellion into a class war . " The people must seal their social gains with blood , " he cried last week . " I will not compromise or throw away anything for which I have fought for 25 years . "
