Italy declared herself in the war on Japan last week . The announcement was made by aging Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Giovanni Visconti-Venosta . The declaration meant little in a military way . <P> But it did mean that to resurrect their standing in the world , Italians would do anything - even commit themselves to a war which they are not prepared to wage , militarily , financially or humanly . <P> The Roosevelt-Churchill declaration re admitting Italy to international high society had given Italians new hope . News of it flashed through Government offices , streets and homes . The declaration salved Italian pride . It also offset the effect of the Russian armistice terms to Rumania , which were much more liberal than the Allied terms to Italy . Even the lowest Italian laborer or peasant knew about the Rumanian-armistice terms . The prestige of the U.S. and Britain went down . The prestige of the Italian Communists and the Socialists , with whom they currently enjoy a united front , went up . <P> Later Italians had second thoughts about the Churchill-Roosevelt declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that General Giovanni di Raimondo had been invited to London for transportation talks , Banker Enrico Scaretti to Washington for Red Cross consultations . A common remark was : " Yes , that 's very nice . Now let 's wait and see what really happens . " <P> This week the Italian Government tried to make something happen . If reports were true , they had taken the Churchill-Roosevelt declaration as a cue to ask officially for participation in the European peace conference as a full-fledged United Nation .
