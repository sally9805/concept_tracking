txt Our social security system is an attempt to minimize the penalty for financial non-success in a competitive society  --  in other words , to be a floor under poverty . When we say this , we have to qualify what we mean by " success . " Relatively few of our population can save enough during even the most useful working years to sustain them during the years when they are , too old or too feeble to work . In modern times no one , whether covered by some form of social security or not , would be left to starve in any civilized country . Social security goes further . It recognizes : first , that those who have contributed to the national product , in however humble a way , have earned the right at least to minimum care when they can no longer contribute ; second , that since this is a right , it ought to be recognized as such so that no one arik be humilian - We did not arrive at Miis stage under the Social Security Act of 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill passed by the House this week is taken up and passed by the Senate at this or a later session . But we are on the way . The House bill adds 11,000,000 persons to the number under national social security , bringing the total to 46,000,000 . The ideal system sf social security would be ' , based wholly the insurance principle . Since we have many elderly people and others who could not qualify for social security insurance , we have in the present measure an assistance feature . But whether the benefits are given as public assistance or received by those who have contributed over a period of time , they have been pitifully small , and they will i remain small under pending legisla- ! tion . A base payment of $45 a month to a retired insured worker is obviously better than a base payment of $26 , but it will not provide luxuries . Even though the average payment of $44 a month in old age assistance is increased by $5 in the poorest states , the recipients will still find it hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both our major parties have committed themselves to the extension of social security . The RepubHams who opposed the House bill did so in most cases because they preferred a. more cautious and leisurely i approach . The future certainly will inelude further extensions of coverage I and of the average benefits . We should'all realize , of course , that I social security is not provided by the , mere act of passing laws and of establishing state and federal cooperation . The money paid out must come out of the total national product . The man who can work must help pay for the benefits going to the man who can not work . Employers must charge insurance to the cost of doing business . Consumers must in many cases pay somewhat higher prices because of this added element of cost . In other words , the man who has earned a loaf of bread must share a slice or two with his hungry neighbor . The man who acquires or rents a house must pay a little more to see that others do not go without shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . As the years go by the number of elderly people in the population will increase and they particularly will need to receive , under conditions preserving their self-respect , some of the usufruct of the nation 's wealth in land and energy . The system under which this will be done has not yet been perfected . There is , for example , no formula which will reconcile industrial pension plans , such ' as have recently come into the arena of labor-management conflict , with federal and state security systems . Grave injustice might be done if some workers belonging to strong unions in large industries received benefits out of ' proportion to those available to ' workers in small industries or in imperfectly unionized industries . We- have groped our way thus . far . We will'have to begin thinking our way through , The " welfare state " has an ominous sound for some people , who ? fear that the emphasis will be on the state rather than on the welfare . Democracy as we have known it certainly is not consistent with any situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is paid out in benefits by governments . On the other hand , the impersonal cruelty which thrusts millions of people into poverty is not democratic either . Welfare legislation must go far enough to make sure that no one suffers for lack of the necessities of life and that no one who does his best within his abilities and opportunities is humiliated when he is sick or old . We want a free society and a free market within that society , but we must have a humane and neighborly society too .
