txt // NETTING An early home art practiced long ago in America was the making of testers or canopies of net for the four-poster beds of colonial days and also nets for dressmaking purposes . In American Needlework Georgiana Brown Harbeson tells us that a guest at Mount Vernon , writing to a friend in Virginia , said of the First Lady , " Her netting is a source of great amusement to her and is so neatly done that all the younger members of the family are proud of having their dresses trimmed with it . " Deerfield , Massachusetts , seems to have been a center for netting in recent times . Mrs. Gertrude C. Smith is an able netter of today who has revived old patterns and has repaired and replaced many wornout historic canopies and edgings for curtains , valances , and so forth . Miss Rachel Hawks is noted for her netted testers for high-post beds , which she makes only to order . The material which Miss Hawks uses is as near like the handspun thread as is possible to obtain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of Charles H. Sawyer , former director of the Worcester Art Museum and now dean of the Division of the Arts , Yale University , learned the craft of netting from one of Deerfield 's experts . Mrs. Sawyer made many canopies for four-poster beds and taught her neighbors and friends how to make them . She had long been interested in handicrafts , and during his lifetime her husband , who shared her interest , was a sponsor of the beautiful Ship Room in the Addison Gallery of American Art at Andover , Massachusetts . Mrs. Marie E. Masales of Woodstock , Vermont , writes that netting is now her principal work although she embroiders , does needlepoint , hooks rugs , and knits . She has made handicrafts almost since her babyhood in Canada over seventy years ago and is still filling orders . Mrs. Arthur Teeri of Durham , New Hampshire , is another maker of fine canopies . Netters , whose skill is in making nets for fishermen or is an outgrowth of fishnetmaking , are noted in Chapter 15 . LACEMAKING One of the best-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restorer of fine laces , is Mrs. Teresa A. Pellegrini of Boston . In Santa Margherita , Italy , where she was born , Teresa learned from her mother to thread bobbins for the fascinating art of pillow lacemaking . At the age of five she attended , as did all other little girls of the // neighborhood , a school for lacemaking in the morning and a public school in the afternoon . She continued at school and practiced at home until she could make Genoese , Milanese , Venetian , Flemish , French , Irish , and English designs . Later , when she came to America , she was able to restore fine pieces of old lace for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts ; and now as a master craftsman of the Society of Arts and Crafts , she makes special lace on order . In her pillow lacemaking she has sometimes used more than 650 bobbins in the working out of a single pattern . A number of Massachusetts lacemakers are connected with a group known as the Worcester Folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this group showed their lace at the Worcester Exhibition . Miss Berzelia Bagdasarian was represented by a doily with lace edges ; Miss Lucia Parsekian showed two examples of Armenian lacework ; Miss Ankine Shamgochian exhibited a runner with insertions of Armenian lace . Mrs. Louise Walker of Mount Hermon , Massachusetts , made a very attractive altar piece of crocheted lace about two and one-half feet Ode by six feet long , which was also shown at the Worcester Exhibition . It was made in a Catholic school , where lacemaking and other handicrafts are carried on , and was for use in a local church . Mrs. John P. Bainbridge of Hingham is another well-known lacemaker of Massachusetts . CROCHETING No one need worry that crocheting will die out ; the number who practice it is legion and the purposes for which it is carried on are amazing . Its range is from a simple chain of thread to a cover for a dining-room table or a bedspread , and the technique is such that feet could be extended to miles if there were need for it , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yarn or thread . Crocheting in simple stitches is the most elementary of the string arts in which tools are used . In the field of personal adornment crochet stitches are often combined beautifully from dainty edgings for a handkerchief to a complete dress . With all its fascination , its versatility , and the countless practical uses to which it is put , crocheting is not generally accorded the high rating it deserves as a hand art to be included oftener in American handicraft exhibitions . There are , it seems to the writer , several reasons why this has been true . One reason that has tended to exclude crochet is that the concept of handicrafts , popular among those who promote // handicraft programs , put on exhibitions , and write on the subject , is none too broad . Perhaps another is that , when crochet is included at all in exhibits or in books on handicrafts , good placing and lighting of real or pictured articles are too often absent . Among guides that might be mentioned as helpful on these points is the excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crochet . The illustrations here are a model not only for a book but also for purposes of exhibitions , the principles being similar in both . A third factor which would bring crocheting into greater favor would be more originality in design . From the standpoint of the number who participate , crocheting is one of the most democratic of handicrafts . It is also one of the most exact ? yarns , threads , and hooks having been thoroughly standardized . Furthermore , it is economical , measured in terms of what a little material and a small investment will yield in articles of use and beauty . For these and other reasons ? including the ease with which crocheting can be learned , the availability of materials and the fact that , like knitting , it can be practiced almost anywhere , at any time ? it merits increasing consideration . There are few crafts which are so elastic , and it is to be hoped that the crocheters of the United States who have received so many stitches and patterns from Europe and have adapted them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs that are new and beautiful . // HANDMADE RUGS AND CARPETS T HE word " rug " as used here means a partial floor covering ; carpet means an entire floor covering . Our interest is in rugs and carpets made by hand . Rugs may be divided roughly into seven classes : hooked , braided or plaited , hand-loomed , knitted and crocheted , needlework , rugs or mats made of cornhusks , and those made of tanned animal pelts . The most widely made and used are the first three kinds : the hooked , the braided , and the hand-loomed or hand-woven rug . This chapter is limited largely to these three . Many rugs produced in New England derive their names from the method of making , the materials used , or sometimes the design , but most of these can be classified under one of the main heads listed above . For instance , there are the patchwork , appliqued , scalloped , cross-stitched , embroidered , and needlepoint types , which are all needlework rugs because they are made mainly with the sewing needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few specimens in New England , belongs to the hand-woven group . Although it is not woven with a shuttle , the filler is tied to the warp . However , this type is not to be confused with the Oriental rug designs that are worked in the hooked technique . The tapestry rug also belongs to the handwoven or hand-loomed group . The hooked , pulled , or drawn-in rug is made in every state of the Union and in every province of Canada . Measured in terms of the numbers who participate in the making , in the variety and beauty of design , in the extent to which it is used in the homes of its makers , or even of those who buy it , the hooked rug is the most outstanding form of present-day American folk art . To this folk art New England artists and craftsmen have made great contributions . Probably the first rugs to be hooked in America were done in New England ; certainly many of the finest have been produced there . Literature on the hooked rug is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subject has been approached in many 113 // ways : from the standpoint of research into origins and the evaluation of designs and craftsmanship ; from the standpoint of the development of the art in New England , as seen through the eyes of a teacher and craftsman ; or as part of a general survey of handmade rugs and carpets by a specialist in the field . Several factors contribute to the popularity of rug-hooking , the principal one being that this is a form of folk art that almost anyone can carry out . There are excellent hookers even among the blind . Tools and equipment required are simple and materials are inexpensive . They consist of canvas , burlap , or some other fabric stretched upon a frame as a foundation , and a hook to push the yarns or cloth strips through the fabric . Even the frame is omitted by a few rugmakers who prefer to hook on their laps . With some types of rugs this is a pleasant thing to do , but the best hooking requires the steady control that a sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every family , has cloth of some kind that can be worked into a hooked rug . Mill ends , yarns , and other bought materials often make good rugs , but the commonest and frequently the most cherished are those made from clothing that has long since worn out , or perhaps from only fragments of cloth , as , for instance , small pieces of old Paisley shawls . All members of the family can work on the same rug , from grandmother to granddaughter . The New England states should be given credit for pioneering and for maintaining high standards in the art of hooking , but recognition should be made of the influence of eastern Quebec and the Maritime Provinces . Each country is indebted to the other ; the Canadian hooked rug has been important in the development of rug-hooking on this side of the border , and many craftsmen from Canada are now taking a noteworthy part in this popular home industry in their adopted communities . ORIGIN OF THE HOOKED RUG As to the origin of the hooked rug , opinions vary from naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my grandmother in New England , " to the authentic statement that the Copts employed the hooked-rug technique as far back as the sixth and possibly the third century . From observation of ancient textiles still in existence William Winthrop Kent has discovered that Coptic craftsmen employed basically the same technique as that used by New Englanders today . In his book , The Hooked Rug , he gives a photograph of a hooked or drawn-in textile of the sixth century from // the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . He has found examples of this technique elsewhere , including Spain , but that part of his research which is of most immediate interest is the investigating he has encouraged in the British Isles . It has resulted in conclusive evidence that hooked rugs , bearing other names such as " thrummed " and " brodded , " have been made in the British Isles for a long time , possibly four hundred years or more . This is also the considered judgment of Mr. Kent 's valued collaborator , Miss Ann Macbeth , chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due study she concluded that rugs called " bookie rugs " had been made in northern England , southern Scotland , the North of Ireland , Wales , and in Norway . The fact has thus been established that the hooked rug did not originate in America . It probably came to us from the British Isles . s EARLY DEVELOPMENTS IN RUGMAKING More important than the origin of the hooked rug are the facts as to the perfection in design , color , and technique to which it has been brought in Canada , New England , and other parts of the United States . The period between the two great wars , including the years of depression , probably witnessed more widespread activity in this handicraft than New England had ever known . There are some who feel that the peak of hooked-rugmaking was reached in this section during the 1860 's . That the craft received a great impetus soon after the Civil War there is no doubt , but with a few exceptions the rugs made then did not equal those made toward the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those being made today . How long hooked rugs have been made in New England has not been satisfactorily established . We know that the technique of hooking was employed for bed covers in the Revolutionary War . Mr. Kent shows a photograph of one of these covers initialed " EH " dated 1779 , and another , " made by Mary West for self and husband , Nathan , " of unclipped wool on a wool base dated 1763 . Very few hooked rugs are dated , but the approximate time of the making of several early New England rugs has been set in the first half of the 1800 's . We are sure that the art had developed well in both New England and Canada before the 1860 's . Frost the Rug Man Something happened in New England soon after the Civil War that had more to do with the encouragement of rug-hooking in our country than any other single occurrence . It was the return to his home in // Biddeford , Maine , in 1863 of a twenty-year-old soldier , Edward Sands Frost , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the service or resume his former occupation in a machine shop . An outdoor life without too strenuous labor was imperative , and young Frost became a tin peddler . His own account of this experience follows : By close economy , I saved my first thousand dollars , and it was the proudest day of my life , when in January , ' 69 , after taking account of stock , I found I had invested in household goods $200 , in team outfit $175 , in staple goods and cash in bank $700 . As the profits did not average over two dollars per day , it had required the strictest economy to support my family , and save that amount . It was a hard struggle , but that is the only way a poor man can get capital to go into business . It is easy enough to make money , if a man has money to work with . The story was originally told to a reporter of a newspaper of Mr. Frost 's native town , the Biddeford Times , in 1888 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pearl K. McCown in her book , The Dreams Beneath Designs , and is given here in briefer form . Frost 's great contribution to rug-hooking was his practical inventions for making patterns , many of good quality , which were available to countless workers throughout New England and the country . He thus popularized a rural art for which New England women had long shown marked aptitude . In the course of business Frost collected a quantity of colored rags which his wife decided to make into a rug . A pattern was marked out on burlap with red chalk and Mrs. Frost went to work with the kind of hook then used , which was often made of a nail or an old gimlet . Frost 's first contribution was to make a crooked hook of the type now in use . He soon spent his evenings in hooking ; he had " caught the fever . " The pattern pleased the neighborhood women so much that they wanted others like it . Twenty orders came in within three days . So you see I got myself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stormy days sketching designs , giving only the outlines in black . There was not money enough in it to devote my whole time to the business , and as the orders came in faster than I could fill them I began , Yankee-like , to study some way to do them quicker . Then the first idea of stencilling presented itself to me . Did I go to Boston to get my stencils made ? Oh , no , I went out into my stable where I had some old iron and some old wash boilers I had bought for their copper bottoms , took the old tin off of them and tnnde my first stencil out of it . Where did I get the tools ? Why // I found them in the same place , in my stable among the old iron . I got there some old files , half flat and half round , took them to the tin shop of Cummings and West and forged my tools to cut the stencil with . I made a cutting block out of old lead and zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small stencils of single flowers , scrolls , leaves , buds , etc. , each one on a small plate ; then I could with a stencil brush print in ink in plain figures much faster than I could sketch . Thus I had reduced ten hours ' labor to two and a half hours . I then had the art down fine enough to allow me to fill all my orders , so I began to print patterns and put them in my peddler 's cart and offer them for sale . The news of my invention of stamped rugs spread like magic , and many a time as I drove through the streets of Biddeford and Saco , a lady would appear at the door or window , swinging an apron or sun bonnet , and shouting at the top of her voice , say , " Are you the rug man ? Do you carry rugs all marked out ? " I at once became known as Frost , the rug man , and many Biddeford citizens still speak of me in that same way . My rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print fast enough ; I also found it difficult to duplicate my patterns , or make two exactly alike , as many of my customers would call for a pattern just like Mrs. So and So 's . Then I began to make a whole design on one plate . At first it seemed impossible , but I was willing to try , so I obtained a sheet of zinc and printed on it and cut out a design . This process I continued to follow till I had some fourteen different designs on hand , ranging from a yard long and half a yard wide to two yards long and a yard wide . . . . It required a great deal of patience , for I was just thirty days cutting the first one and when I laid it on the table the center of the plate would not touch the table by two and a half inches . As the plate of zinc lay smooth before being cut , I knew it must be the cutting that caused the trouble ; I studied into the problem and learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncut portion in proportion to that which was cut and the plate then lay smooth . This I did with a hammer , and it took about two days ' time . When the plate was finished I could print with it a pattern in four minutes that had previously required ten hours to sketch by hand . I then thought I had my patterns about perfect , for I began to prepare them for the market . I remember well the first trip I made through Maine and a part of New Hampshire , trying to sell my goods to the dry goods trade . I failed to find a man who dared to invest a dollar in them ; in fact , people did not know what they were for , and I had to give up trying for a while and go from house to house . There I found plenty of purchasers , for I found the ladies knew what the patterns were for . Next I began coloring the patterns by hand , as I had some call // for colored goods . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell them at a profit seemed to be the point on which the success of the whole business hung , and it took me over three months to settle it . I shall never forget the time and place it came to me . . . . It was March , 1870 , one morning about two o'clock . I had been thinking how I could print the bright colors in with the dark ones so as to make good clear prints . My mind was so fixed on the problem that I could not sleep , so I turned and twisted and all at once I seemed to hear a voice in my room say : " Print your bright colors first and then the dark ones . " That settled it , and I was so excited that I could not close my eyes in sleep the rest of the night and I tell you I was glad when morning came so I could get to town to buy stock for the plates with which to carry out my idea . At the end of a week I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were such a success that Frost sold his peddling business and opened a salesroom in Boston . Before long he had four men working for him in Biddeford . He continued making patterns until 1876 when he sold his Biddeford interests and went to California to regain his health . Many of the Frost stencils and his equipment were kept together and a few years ago were purchased by Mrs. Charlotte K. Stratton of Montpelier , Vermont . Mrs. Stratton and her husband built a special studio in a barn on their home property and have made a remarkable workshop and museum with every possible convenience for showing and using this priceless collection . While the advent of stamped patterns facilitated the process of rughooking and was a permanent advance of importance , the quality of design and craftsmanship showed no general improvement in the period following the Civil War . In fact , there was general deterioration in commercial designs until toward the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth . Since then much has been done to improve designs and craftsmanship by individuals , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sabatos , and Subbekashe Rugs At about the turn of the century there were a few evidences of a new and vigorous interest in both designing and making rugs of various kinds . An account of this development is given by Max West in The Revival of Handicrafts in America , published in 1904 as a bulletin of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor . The development was particularly marked in the Abnakee neighborhood rug industry in Pequaket ( Silver Lake ) , New Hampshire ; the // Sabatos rugs in Center Lovell , Maine ; the Cranberry Isles rug industry at Cranberry Isles , opposite Northeast Harbor , Maine ; the Subbekashe rug industry at Belchertown , Massachusetts . There were some other small fires burning . The Deerfield Rug Makers , who were weavers of rag rugs , were a part of the handicraft movement revived at Deerfield , Massachusetts . At the summer School of Art held at Ipswich , directed by Arthur W. Dow , blue and white " willow tree " rugs were worked . The Ladies Aid Society of Isle La Motte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Elizabeth Fisk , whose work in weaving has been noted elsewhere . " Pilgrim " rugs were woven at Pittsfield , Massachusetts , from cotton strips prepared by women of Pilgrim Memorial Church . The time about which we are now writing coincided with the beginning of the arts and crafts movement , but it is difficult to say what if any effect the movement had upon the rugmaking development ; it is a matter of record , however , that the Abnakee rug experiment in New Hampshire did influence the development of some of the community groups . Mrs. Helen R. Albee established her home in Pequaket , New Hampshire , in 1899 . As a designer she had noted the rugs made in the neighborhood and thought that better designs might create a market for them . Accordingly she worked out some simple , conventional designs with restrained colors . Several rugs were made and exhibited in the village hall , where all were sold and orders taken for more . This was the beginning of a project which developed in the community and encouraged rugmakers elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motifs , Mrs. Albee made stencils for marking the burlap base , bought materials , dyed flannel , trained about thirty workers in the course of five or six years , arranged for exhibitions and sales , and finally wrote a small book , long since out of print , Abnakee Rugs : A Manual Describing the Abnakee Industry , the Methods Used , with Instructions for Dyeing . The rugs were made of flannel strips a quarter of an inch wide , the hooked loops forming a close pile about three-eighths of an inch high , of which only the higher loops were cut . The uncut loops made a firm texture , while the slightly frayed ends of the cut loops lent a velvety quality . Each finished rug was labeled " An Abnakee Rug . " In 1900 Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Volk , at Center Lovell , Maine , began to encourage neighborhood handicrafts . Mr. Volk was an eminent painter . Mrs. Volk developed an all-wool hooked rug known as Sabatos , and invented a knot resembling that used in Oriental rugs . Native honaesptui wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were // carried out by hand except the carding of the wool , which was done at an old water-power mill near Center Lovell . Vegetable dyes were used , indigo produced by the age-old vat method being one of the most important . The Volks arranged exhibitions at the village hall in which the Sabatos rugs were shown at every stage in the process . When the women of Cranberry Isles heard of the Abnakee rug experiment , they undertook a similar enterprise as a winter industry to raise money for church purposes and for a wharf . In these rugs a somewhat firmer texture was obtained by using two yards of flannel to the square foot instead of one and one-quarter to one and onehalf as at Pequaket . The dyestuffs used were procured from Mrs. Albee . All the Cranberry Isles rugs were marked with " CR " . The Subbekashe rug industry , with a product quite similar to the Abnakee rugs , was started at Belchertown , Massachusetts , in 1902 by Miss Lucy D. Thomson . Her designs were drawn largely from American Indian motifs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they all strove to improve design , color , and craftsmanship , unquestionably influencing the handicraft movement . The interest of certain fine furniture and department stores was enlisted in the furnishing of homes with hooked rugs . B. Altman and Company of New York was a particularly vigorous and discriminating pioneer in the field of handmade rugs , under the direction of James A. Keillor . All these factors , often emphasized by books and magazine articles , had their due part in stimulating the hooking of rugs . RUG-HOOKING IN MAINE For forty years or more the Maine Seacoast Missionary Society has ministered to the needs of 10,000 people living on the lonely headlands and islands off the coast from Kittery to Calais . It has more than a hundred ports of call along a coastline 300 miles long as the crow flies but 2,500 as the boat plies along the shore . During the 1920 's the Mission encouraged the making of Seacoast Mission rugs , which developed into an interesting revival of the rug-hooking art . Its hookers could hardly be called a " group " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two or three in a single neighborhood , and numbering only about a score in all , but there was among them a strong solidarity of interest and effort . The teacher and leader , Mrs. Alice M. Peasley , now dean of the Mission , is a well-known character to every old inhabitant of the islands . " Ma Teasley , " as the island folk call her , is a painstaking worker , and the woman whom she taught to hook were just as particular in their choice of motifs and colors . Of the score of rugs made in the // period of their activity , several , still constantly in use , can be identified . There is also a collection , largely reminiscent of the sea , in the small memorial museum at the ferry landing on Islesford , Maine . Good material , careful work , and freedom to follow the imagination made most of these rugs true expressions of folk art . One , designed by Mrs. Peasley and still in her possession , was made by Miss Mary Bunker in nature 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Partridges ? a realistic scene of partridges on the heath or " haith , " as it is still known along the seacoast . Mrs. Peasley likes to talk of the interest the women show in their work , the appeal that beauty makes to them , and how they welcome the opportunity to express their creative urge , sometimes with reverence , as did the one who said , " This is nature 's design , and I bow to it . " More than one of the hookers , after finishing a rug , would say , " I do n't know how I can let this one go . " One of the rugs was called Methuselah because so much time was required to make it . The worker felt that she just had to hook in a big yellow rose that had nothing to do with the design . When it went to the exhibit , Ma Peasley made sure that it was well hidden in a pile of more respectable rugs , hoping that no one would see it , and to be doubly sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she marked on it the exorbitant price of $50 ; but an inquisitive lady from the city spied the yellow of the rose , pulled it out of the pile , and to the amazement of all gladly paid the $50 . In another instance a rough sketch of a Maine pasture had been given to one of the women to fill in , and it was suggested that since she had a little bull calf she might work him into the design . When the rug came back there was a big buffalo instead . None thought that a buffalo in a Maine pasture would do , but the rugmaker explained that she had always been more interested in buffaloes than in calves , and when she began to hook , said she , " That 's the way I saw it . " She thought maybe other people might see it that way too . The buffalo rug turned out to be one of the best sellers . Another favorite was a heap of autumn vegetables and fruit , outlined in black with some of the fruit raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by Mrs. John McGinnis of Southwest Harbor . Among the most beautiful of the rugs produced were those depicting scenes along the coast of Maine . Ma Peasley and her rug-hooking neighbors sometimes have business hi New York . On one occasion , after viewing some of the extremes of fashion in a shop window , one of her friends turned to her and remarked , " I guess rich people really wear things like that . It 's kind of nice to be poor , ai n't it ? " Ma Peasley 's own comments are pointed : // " Up here in Maine we have twenty-four hours ? but you do n't have a split second to spare in New York . " However , she respects the differences she observes and would have them respected . " You can have your chilled grapefruit for breakfast , but give me my pie . " It will be remembered that some of the pioneers in the organization of the Winter Industries Cooperative of Northeast Harbor were hooking rugs before hand-loom weaving was begun . Among the hookers were Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and other hookers now makes the output of rugs by the Winter Industries Cooperative one of its main products . Miss Henrietta H. Ames of Matinicus Island hooks rugs for the floor and pictures for the wall , of which she has made about sixty since 1934 . Her interpretation of local scenes or happenings is recorded in pleasant color harmonies . Her own house on the edge of the woods with the local ice pond in the foreground , partly bordered with evergreen timber , makes a pleasing composition . Another study is of the sailing vessel Julia Fairbanks , seining for mackerel . This rug is an authentic record of the old days when , as Miss Ames remembers , perhaps a hundred of these seine-boats and dories , not omitting the larger boat carrying the seine , were to be seen from the island . Miss Ames 's rag pictures have both artistic and documentary value . She contributed a chapter on local church history to the book on Matinicus by Charles A. E. Long , referred to in Chapter 3 . In a letter written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags which the lobstermen use , and for entertainment I paint pictures . " Mrs. Hazel W. Bullard of Alfred is a collector of rugs , a teacher , and a rugmaker of note . She has in her collection a rug with a design of strawberries and blue-green leaves , which was bought from Edward Frost and worked by Mrs. Bullard 's mother in Columbia , New Hampshire , about 1870 . In her home Mrs. Bullard has other fine examples of both old and modern rugs . As an instructor she has given encouragement to classes formed under the Maine Crafts service and is teaching privately as well as in schools . She knew personally Miss Minnie Light of Burkettville , Maine , who drew several original floral designs for Edward Frost . These are now in Mrs. Bullard 's collection and are known as the Minnie 's Garden Series . Miss Light 's flower garden was the inspiration for her work ; her method was to select the flowers , lay them on paper , cut them out , and then place the paper designs on the burlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ingenious method were among the most beautiful of the floral rugs of Maine . Mrs .. Bullard also owns the original patterns of another early hooker , Miss Lilla Bumps of Thomaston . These original designs in folk art // were derived usually from scenes near at hand . Mrs. Bullard 's own rugs and designs , some of them introducing bees and butterflies , have been illustrated in various magazines ? particularly a beautiful reproduction of the Harriet Emery rug in the Christian Science Monitor of March 25 , 1936 . Mrs. John P. Winchell of Freeport is an acomplished rugmaker and teacher , having had charge of classes for the state in Freeport , Bath , Camden , and other nearby towns . She has taught more than sixty women how to hook . One of the finest hooked rugs made in recent years in Maine was designed and hooked by Mrs. Winchell for Robert P. Tristram Coffin . Both Mr. Winchell , a safety engineer in the shipyards at Bath , and Mrs. Winchell are discriminating craftsmen . Mrs. Sherman Abbott of Eliot is an expert hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she feels like it . " Some days I just ca n't do it , " she explained , " when the mood is not just right ; but when it is , then nothing else takes its place . " She remembers vividly a rug which her grandmother made , a kind of crazy-quilt pattern which they called The Broken Dish , and has hooked a large one of the same pattern for her own home . The design is made up of forms like broken dishes . The rug has unusual beauty because of the careful selection of colors and their harmonious arrangement . Much of the dyeing for Mrs. Abbott and other women who make rugs in the community is tastefully done by Mrs. Clara Jane Brown , who sells the dyed materials to neighbors at a uniform price . When the writer called , Mrs. Abbott had a large quantity of her materials arranged in compartments on the wall of her " rag room , " and with the sun coming through the windows this display itself was a beautiful pattern in color . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which she had prepared the dyes herself . The rug was about three by six feet . It was , in the writer 's opinion , good enough for a museum piece . A pleasure which she shares with friends and neighbors is her scrapbook about rugs , including many clippings and quotations . One of her favorite " scraps , " cut from a Maine paper , thus describes an old rug : " This was a garden of warm colors lying on the oak floor before my mother 's fireplace . Deep mine roses and blue bowknots and a spray of heart 's desire . " RUG-HOOKING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE With the growth of the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts , billed rugmakers came into being and their products were shown at annual Craftsman 's Fairs and in the League 's shops throughout the // state . Miss Harriet M. Cilley of Plymouth , often an exhibitor at the Fair , is one of the best hooked-rugmakers in New England . She has made two rugs of special interest to New Hampshire : one showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the village of Plymouth . Miss Cilley is self-taught and delightfully original . A member of the League said , " I think she is one of our finest artists ? collectors are always waiting for her next piece of work . " Mrs. R. A. Eggleston of Newport both designs and hooks rugs . She learned the craft from her mother , a native of Nova Scotia , who , like many other Canadian-born Americans , did much to improve standards of craftsmanship in New England . Mrs. Eggleston made a fireplace rug shown in the New Hampshire building at the World 's Fair in New York in 1939 . Mrs. Ada M. Ericson of Claremont has probably hooked as many doll house rugs as anyone in New England . She writes : " I began hooking some seventeen years after one false start and thirty years of anticipation . My relatives had been rug-hookers of the old school ? for economical and salvage reasons . " Since she started to count she had made 167 chair seats , innumerable doll house rugs and " well within shooting distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts , and the Women 's Educational and Industrial Union of Boston . " I use choice wool rags , old if possible , and new if necessary . Rug-hooking . . . has all the earmarks of being a disease from which I seem unable to recover . " Mrs. Lillian B. Prescott of Exeter specializes in hooking rugs . At the 1943 Craftsman 's Fair at Manchester she exhibited one of the best large hooked rugs shown there . In fifteen years she has made more than a hundred rugs , some of them very large . Her most prized work is a series of wall hangings depicting scenes from the Bayeux Tapestry done in hooking technique . Often these are mistaken for needlework , which disappoints Mrs. Prescott , who says , " I am always pleased to be known as a hooker . " At the Boston Garden Show in 1943 a rug considered by many to be the finest shown there was designed by Mrs. Bruce Zeiser of Providence and worked out by Miss Claire F. Ingalls , then of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece , folklike in character , was called the Rockweed design because the border was derived from a kind of rock seaweed . The background was a sandy tone against which was a blending of garden flowers informally arranged . Much of the dyeing of the rags had been done by Miss Ingalls . Her father , a native of Germany and a craftsman in wood , makes records ii- color photography of his daughter 's most important ' rugs . // Mrs. Elizabeth Morse of the Scrap Bag in Warner directs the work of a group of hookers in her neighborhood who have made many rugs to order , ranging from the least expensive to some selling for as much as $300 each . Mrs. Morse usually selects the colors and patterns for them . RUGMAKING IN VERMONT The work of Mrs. Charlotte K. Stratton of Montpelier has already been mentioned in connection with the stencils of Edward Frost . She and Mr. Stratton have been of great help in combining old methods and new in the preparation of designs , the transfer of patterns , and the final hooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around Johnson have worked together for more than ten years making hooked , braided , knitted , and crocheted rugs , as well as quilts of many patterns , crocheted bedspreads , tablecloths , and various types of needlework . Their organization is the Helen Collins Handicraft Club , named after its founder , who although an invalid always worked with her hands . She felt that by meeting and working together the neighborhood women could accomplish more than by working separately , and that much would be added to their good times . Since Miss Collins died the women have continued to meet regularly every month . Mrs. Belle Kneeland , one of the group , conducts a gift shop in her home , where she sells the work of the members . She does both hooking and knitting , and sent knitted lace to the Worcester Exhibition of Contemporary Handicrafts . Mrs. Will Davis , known locally as " Aunt Essie , " has been a member of the Club from the beginning . A portrait of Mrs. Davis with some of her rugs is shown . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in natural colors in a design made by laying the leaves down on the burlap and remembering how they looked . Mrs. Davis said she always loved to walk through the leaves when she was a little girl . " Things that you have seen all your life , " she remarked , " you do n't really see until you are interested in them . " " She showed the writer other rugs , and described how she had made a special scalloped design with a teacup , " Oh , it was a lovely design ! " On the wall behind her was a rug featuring a big Maltese cat , a favorite with her and her husband . They often lamented that they did not have photographs made of him while he was alive . Finally Mrs. Davis felt she had to make the best likeness of him she could in a rug , although she had never drawn a cat before . Glancing in the direction of the kitchen // where her husband was reading she said , " I guess he must like it ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a set of wooden knitting needles revealed that Mrs. Davis had made them herself for a niece who wanted to learn to knit . She had just made a rug portraying Uncle Sam , a standing figure with his hands in his pockets , where Mrs. Davis put them because she " did not know how to draw them . " Suddenly Aunt Essie asked if we knew whether the seeds in an apple pointed toward the stem or toward the blow . Of course , we did not know . She had other rural conundrums . Another member of the Helen Collins Club is Mrs. Seth Washer of Morrisville . We got to her house early one fall morning and found her hard at work on a flowered rug stretched on a frame twelve feet long . The frame reached from the kitchen stove to the single window , the sill of which was lined with ripening tomatoes . Pushed as far into the corner as it would go was a big loom on which Mrs. Washer weaves both rag rugs and home textiles . The days were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work difficult , so Mrs. Washer was making the most of the precious morning light coming through the kitchen window . We begged her to go on with her hooking while we talked . It did not seem to her the right thing to do , for visitors came seldom , but she consented to work till she got a big flower hooked in . Mrs. Washer is not only one of the best hookers , she has the great human quality of gratitude for the blessings of life ? strength to work , a clear conscience , and , as an extra resource , a hand clever in craftsmanship . Her rug won for the Club the first prize of $100 in a national competition in which 3,300 clubs had entries . It has a beautiful yellowish background with cornucopia and flowers , an adaptation of a folk design made in Vermont a long time ago . A corner of it appears in the frontispiece . Mr. Washer says he will never forget the day of the award . His wife was " glummer than a beetle " that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national prize all was right with the world . Without interfering with the hooking Mr. Washer played his favorite tunes on his fiddle ? " Zipp Coon , " and " The Irish Washer Woman , " and finally at Mrs. Washer 's suggestion , " The White Cockade , " of which she said , " I like it best , you get the most out of the fiddle for it . " One of the rugs which its maker had most enjoyed hooking was a study of the famous trotting horse Jay Eye See , that held the 2:10 record ice 1882 . " The only thing I have always wanted that I never have had is a genuine Morgan horse . " This seemed an unusual preference , but it was expressed with such conviction that no one could doubt it . Among ninny others who are doing hooked rugs in Vermont are Mrs. Von Dette of Bennington , whose designs arc original ; Mrs. Charles // Wishart of . Barre , who designed the Bride 's Rug shown at the Worcester Exhibition ; and Mrs. Herta Moselsio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color give her creations distinction . RUG-HOOKING IN MASSACHUSETTS In 1923 the South End House in Boston began making hooked rugs under the auspices of the South End House Industry . To this settlement , located in a lodging house section of Boston , came men and women from Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , and the Canadian provinces , among whom were always some who had learned rughooking in their former homes and who were eager to put their skills and experiences to use . The attractive and spacious workrooms were well equipped ; skillful teachers , designers , and supervisors were employed ; and it was not long before this workshop was busy making salable rugs . The floor rugs made at South End House were usually oblong in shape , of standard sizes , and in interesting designs . New and carefully chosen materials were used and the dyeing was done on the premises , which was one of the special features of the project . During the depression of the 1930 's rug-hooking was discontinued and has not yet been resumed . Mrs. Caroline C. Saunders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably no one has had a wider influence , both direct and indirect , upon the development of this branch of handicraft in New England . Aside from her appreciation of the best qualities of hooking , she has a real understanding of the need of people , especially of women , to find some outlet for their urge to create , where the effort culminates in a useful and beautiful thing for the home . Realizing the necessity to do something to relieve the tension which her neighbors and their friends were subjected to during the depression years as factories closed down and general morale ebbed , Mrs. Saunders , at the time president of the Woman 's Club , thought that rug-hooking would bring to many the satisfactions which come from creative work , and to others an opportunity to earn something with their hands . The story of her learning all she could about hooking , and teaching and having others teach the rudiments of the craft , making her home the center for work and exhibitions and hospitality , is too long to outline here . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her interest and efforts much of the revival of rug-hooking in New England and elsewhere can be traced . Mrs. Pearl K. McCown of West Boylston has helped to preserve // the best traditions of rugmaking . In addition to being a designer and craftsman she is a teacher , lecturer , collector , and writer . Each year special exhibitions are held of the work of Mrs. McGown and of her pupils , usually at Horticultural Hall in Worcester . These exhibitions are attended by persons from all parts of New England and from many other states . The various processes of dyeing and hooking are demonstrated . Prepared materials , with instructions as to how they may be used with some of the patterns , are available at reasonable cost . There is a general interchange of ideas and experiences among hookers and teachers . This is probably the most important annual gathering of rugmakers in our country . With its exhibitions , demonstrations , and general information , it is the starting place for many workers in this popular folk art . At least one dealer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Burnham . His widow and successor , Nellie M. Burnham of Ipswich , continues to sell early patterns collected by Mr. Burnham and to repair and restore rugs . Mr. Burnham was not only a distributor of patterns and materials for rugmakers and a buyer and seller of old and fine rugs , but a close student and observer who wrote ' considerably . Mr. Kent included Mr. Burnham in a list of eleven " who were the first to renew the early appreciation and encourage the revival in America of rug-hooking , " and reproduced a number of choice rugs from the Burnham collection . The business at Ipswich is still a center of interest and information for rug-hookers . Mr. Burnham 's valuable article on " The New England Hooked Rug " is published in the latest edition of the catalogue issued by Mrs. Burnham . His standing offer is there renewed of a reward for exact information as to " when and where the first hooked rugs were made in America . " Mrs. C. E. Anderson of Holyoke , whose work is mentioned again in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Handicraft Fairs held at Northampton . She once showed a beautiful rug which she was finishing for herself , a large floral design with a tan background and a border in which she had worked parts of a worn-out Paisley shawl . People get into rug-hooking in an infinite number of ways . Mrs. Royal F. Manson of Hudson writes : " The business of designing hooked rugs and teaching rugmaking was established by my son . After four years at the School of Practical Art and the Museum School at Boston , he was unable to find work . That was during years when so many people were desperate to find something to do . Hooked rugs caught his interest and he wondered why they were always copies of old rugs , soon ' good , some bad . IIc had the idea a hooked riig could be good with nn original design . Immediately I became interested and started // to make designs under his supervision to prove that his idea was sound . Since then I have continued to make rugs and I have never worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being a housewife , I do not make many rugs in a year , three last year , two of which I sold . . . . I make patterns and dye rags to sell . " One of the most extraordinary hooked carpets discovered in making this study was the floor covering for the altar in the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes at Wellfleet on Cape Cod . The carpet had been made by the local sewing circle about 1913 . The Reverend Joseph Eikerling had designed it and instructed the women in hooking . The designs were of folk-type hooked in woolen yarn . Irish , French , Portuguese , and other Americans of European lineage participated in the work . RUG-HOOKING IN CONNECTICUT Because of an eye injury when she was younger , Mrs. Josephine M. Davis of Somers was not able to satisfy her love of color until she took up hooking . This gave her an outlet that was not a great strain on her eyes and enabled her to earn at the same time . During the decade and a half that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only tools being a pair of shears and a crochet hook . She works without a frame . She likes to use animals in her designs , getting help from the best available pictures in color . Mrs. Richard Wampler of New Britain has made hooked rugs for her own pleasure for more than twelve years . She has copied some of the Oriental rugs in the Ballard Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . Her rugs have been exhibited by the Society of Connecticut Craftsmen . Mrs. Vida Jopson of West Hartford is one of the most skillful New England rugmakers . She was represented at the Worcester Exhibition by a beautiful runner with autumn leaves , notable for its design , color combination , and perfection in hooking . RUG-HOOKING IN RHODE ISLAND Mrs. Molly Nye Tobey of Barrington , near Providence , is known as one of the most original designers and makers of hooked rugs in our country . All her rugs are individual and are modern in spirit and execution . The design of the Victory Garden rug , which was shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family garden . It received first prize in the Woman 's Day national hooked-rug competition iii 1942 . This rug is shown in the frontispiece . Mrs. Tobey 's coloring is strong yet very harmonious and the technique impression130 HANDICRAFTS OF NEW ENGLAND istic . At Worcester she was represented also by The Farm , a rug in which a few excellent colors are combined in barnyard motifs . The texture of these rugs is fairly coarse , yet firm , and in keeping with the rural subjects , which she prefers . Mrs. Bruce Zeiser of Providence , already referred to , has designed many rugs for others , as well as for her own hooking . Among those hooked by her perhaps the best known was reproduced in color in Woman 's Day for August , 1943 . It was called a Flower Medley , a room-sized rug in tawny and muted colors on a warm ecru background . The scroll-type border picks up the flowers from the design in the center . The hooking of this large rug was an unusual achievement in craftsmanship . BRAIDED RUGS The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England with the development of some excellent designs . In a braided rug the mechanics of the process are : first , the cutting of the cloth into strips ; second , the braiding of the strips ; and third , the sewing of the braided strips together in flat coils to form the rug . An illustration shows the process of braiding by Edwin Pease of Warren , New Hampshire , with one of his finished rugs on the work table in the background . Miss Belle D. Robinson of Williamstown , Vermont , as anyone who sees the picture of her shown in this book will know , is an expert rugmaker , although it is but one of her achievements . Her flower garden , which she tends entirely herself , and her brother 's picturesque tin shop at the rear of their quaint little house against a hill make a beautiful unit in this old Vermont village . Mrs. Arthur Fitzgerald of Waldoboro , Maine , is the director of a group of braided-rugmakers of Lincoln County that have been very successful as a cooperative . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft are members of the cooperative , many of whom are fishermen 's and farmers ' wives . Good rugs are made both for general sale and on order . About seventy braiders make up the group and of these fifty work steadily . Most of their rugs go to the Colonial Rug Company of Maine . HAND-LOOMED RAG RUGS AND CARPETS ! ' here are several weavers in New England who still make the old  - -  fashioned hand-woven rugs and carpets for their own use and also to sell . In tracing the craft of hand-woven rugs and carpets we might // be able to follow clues back to colonial days when the making of rag carpet was one of the most popular handicrafts . It is probable that rural weavers in New England have made rag rugs and carpets during all the years since the Republic was established . In the early part of the present century we find that the Woman 's Club of Plainfield , New Hampshire , organized a Mothers and Daughters Industry , which wove rugs according to color designs made by Mrs. Frances Houston of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. G. S. Ruggles was manager . A trademark with distaff and with the letters " MDI " was sewed in the corner of each rug . When the community ran out of cloth , white cotton flannel was bought and dyed as desired . Exhibits were sent out and hundreds of rugs were made and sold . Six looms were brought into the community , twentyfive workers were kept busy , and the Mothers and Daughters Industry branched out into other forms of weaving . Albert Oughtibridge of Sanford , Maine , born in England and now an American citizen , is a weaver of rugs on a specially designed loom of his own construction . He was wounded during World War I , and on his return to this country was unable to work again in the Sanford Woolen Mills , where he had learned textile processes . When it became necessary to choose a light occupation in which he could make a living , he naturally turned to hand weaving . His special loom has a foot equipment adapted to his needs , which helps him to weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of his rugs are in small standard sizes , very firm in texture , and can be made in almost any color combination . He finds a market for them at his own door . Weaving of this character is usually done to order and frequently with materials furnished by the purchaser . Mrs. Alice O. Fleet of Essex is among the best known Connecticut weavers who make floor coverings . Mrs. Caroline E. Banning of Westerly , Rhode Island , specializes in colonial patterns and hit-or-miss rag carpets and scatter rugs . Occasionally figures are woven into the textile as in the nursery rug designed and woven by Miss Mabel C. Holcomb of Isle La Motte , Vermont , for the children 's corner of the Worcester Handicraft Exhibition . The work of Miss Holcomb and her sister , Eleanor , both experienced craftsmen , has been mentioned in Chapter 5. // THE DYEING OF MATERIALS AND THE DECORATING OF SURFACES THIS chapter deals with some of the various processes employed in changing the surface appearance of a product . Sometimes the entire surface , or even the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a process which may be applied to fibers , yarns , and cloth . Sometimes only part of the surface is changed , as in blockprinting or stenciling on cloth , paper , wood , glass , or metal ; or in decorative painting , illuminating , lettering , or calligraphy . DYEING BY IMMERSION WITH NATURAL COLORS There is renewed and growing interest in the ancient method of dyeing with vegetable and other natural dyes , and in New England unique work has been done with this method . Paralleling the interest in extracting color from the plants of garden , field , and woodland is the interest with which they are studied as sources of food , drink , cosmetics , and medicine . Plants for medicine , as in pioneer days , are still common in some places , and a number of New England men and women give much time to growing , gathering , blending , and vending herbs . Often at craftsmen 's fairs there will be exhibits of dried herbs and extracts in attractive containers . In the Country Store next to Wiggins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old apothecary 's cabinet filled with blown-glass containers holding herbs . Native nut trees , such as walnut , butternut , and hickory , supply food and medicine as well as excellent color for dyeing materials . Occasionally someone will be found who knows equally both the dye and medicinal properties of plants , reminding us of the fact that for centuries medicine and chemistry were a single and united science . The term " natural dyes " comprises the coloring matter obtained from plants , animals , insects , or minerals . The majority of these dyes 132 // are of plant origin except , for example , the red and pink coloring extracted from the insect cochineal , the orange and yellow made from copperas , and a few other colors derived from minerals and shells . Most of the dyes with which this chapter deals are vegetables dyes from plants familiar to people of New England . Interest in the subject , however , is much more than regional . No section , for instance , in recent years has done more in the home manufacture of vegetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have carried out a considerable number of experiments with good results , while in Mexico the use of colors from plants is an unbroken tradition older than history . The thorough student of the subject should not be limited in his observation to what has been accomplished in our own country , but should include our neighbors to the north and south . Commercial and Natural Dyes Compared Something should perhaps be said on the relative merits of home or vegetable dyes as compared with store or commercial dyes , and suggestions made in justification of a wider use of the former , particularly in rural districts where there is an abundance of dye material . The claim that vegetable dyes are always permanent while commercial dyes are not is a common error . No such general assertion can be helpful , for comparison must be made between a specific vegetable dye and a specific commercial dye , and must take into consideration the operations that attend the process of dyeing . Absolute quality is not alone in the dye itself , but partly in the way in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative matter ; that is , a dye may be comparatively fast when exposed to light but may fade when washed . Or the reverse of this may happen . Also fastness may vary with the material used , whether wool , cotton , silk , or some other fiber . Thus some natural dyes may be applied successfully to one kind of material but with less assurance to another . The best commercial dyes are prepared to be used on a specific fiber . The only conclusion , therefore , at which one can arrive as to the relative permanence of vegetable and commercial dyes is that a number of the former are more lasting on certain fibers than some of the latter ; again the reverse is true . On the whole , the record for fastness is with vegetable dyes . They have been in use for centuries ; synthetic dyes are a fairly recent invention . There is one fact about , the fading of the two kinds which gives real advantage to natural dyes . Generally speaking , when natural dyes fade they still bear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softer and more beautiful without losing their character ; a faded synthetic dye , on the contrary , may bear little resemblance to its original tone . Since few colors in any fabric are absolutely fast , the fact that those obtained from natural sources do not usually deteriorate in quality but sometimes improve is a definite advantage . A question often asked by craftsmen wishing to experiment with native dyes is , " Can I get a sufficient color range to ensure good results ? " A satisfactory answer depends upon two basic things : first , the color range desired ; and second , the whereabouts of the craftsman . It is true that in choice of colors synthetic dyes generally far outnumber natural dyes even when one has access to a large variety of dye-producing plants , but wide variety is not always the need of the artist . A few carefully chosen colors will usually bring better results than experiments with many , just as in the graphic arts much of the best printing is achieved with a few well-selected type faces rather than with the endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater range of colors than is generally known has been developed from plants of the New England states , and experiments to increase the number are still in progress . A complete list of colors derived from plants growing in New England would be of interest but we can mention only the following : black , blue , brown , tan , gray , green , orange , purple , red , yellow , and many shades of these . It would seem that the New England craftsman need not feel greatly handicapped by color limitations . To many the relative costs of the two kinds of dyeing is important . For city dwellers synthetic dyes are preferable because , besides being cheap , they are more easily obtained ; native dye plants are inaccessible . The country dweller , too , can now purchase synthetic dyes at a low price , but often he has little cash , and to make his own dye from plants that he can gather is for him often an economy . Synthetic dyes are certainly easier to use but a craftsman will not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often experiences great satisfaction when he can engage in the complete process and thus thoroughly control his medium . To know all the reasons for the choice of a natural dye is obviously not possible . Those who spin and weave by the old processes and who wish to complete the cycle will understand the enthusiasm of the old mountain weaver in her gaily striped skirt who said , " I like to see my petticoat all the way from the sheep 's back . " Others will find in vegetable dyes an opportunity to create a color palette of individuality and perhaps of rare beauty ; this is a unique experience . There is always a new plant to discover , a new dye to make , and a worker can frequently trace his methods // back to the homelands of Europe and to recipes used there for centuries . Some Principles of Dyeing Directions for using natural dyes may be found in many publications but a few basic processes in the preparation of nearly all vegetable dyes will be briefly given here . These basic steps include : first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dye ; third , preparation of the fibers to receive the dyes ; finally , the actual immersion of the fiber followed by the rinsing and drying of the colored product . The material of which the dye is made may be native wild plants , such as sumac berries and hickory bark , or from cultivated plants or trees such as apple bark or coreopsis flowers , or from a plant or tree that is both wild and cultivated , like the black walnut . The dye source may be any portion of the plant ? roots , stems , barks , leaves , nuts , flowers , fruit , seeds , or sometimes the complete plant . In many cases the time of year when the parts are gathered is important . This would be obviously true with flowers and fruits , but it is also true with certain roots and barks . From the sumac blossom and fruit , a different shade varying from a light to a deep tan is obtained according to the state of fruit or flower . Some materials when gathered must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used months and sometimes years later . There are dyes which can be kept in liquid form for a considerable time without losing their potency , and still others in which a part of the dye solution , for instance indigo , can be used over a long period . A few years ago an indigo " blue pot " was discovered in the Southern Highlands . Members of the family who owned it said it had been in continuous use for more than ninety years . Wool is generally the fiber which in New England is colored with vegetable dyes ; rabbit fur and dog hair are sometimes dyed , and probably a little linen is also colored in this way . Some dyes will color both wool and cotton without any preliminary preparation ; this is true of indigo . But in most cases the application of a mordant is required to prepare the fiber to absorb the dye and hold it . Different solutions , in addition to acting as a mordant , sometimes serve to modify the shade . For instance , when alum is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color ; but if the mordant is muriate of tin , the result is brick color . The actual process of dyeing follows the treatment with a mordant , if one is needed , and calls for great care with respect to timing , right // temperature of the dye bath , and careful handling of the material , including constant stirring ( with intermittent lifting and draining ) so that it will not be crowded in the vessel and thus dye unevenly . The kind of vessel ? tin , brass , copper , or iron ? often has a bearing on the color that is obtained . The manner of removing the material from the vessel , of rinsing , and of drying it is also of great importance in obtaining an even color . It is generally held that best results from vegetable dyes come from drying in the open air . Certainly anyone who has ever smelled an indigo blue pot will agree that outdoors is the proper place to work with this dye . The dyeing process may be used equally with woven cloth , thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? when it is " dyed in the wool . " Experiments in Vegetable Dyeing In early days all dyes were derived , of course , from natural sources , for synthetic dyes did not come into general use until the second half of the nineteenth century ; but in recent years further experiments with vegetable dyes have been made by craftsmen who have felt much satisfaction in controlling the entire process of dyeing , or who wished to use colors that could not be had through commercial products . Only a few such experiments can be referred to here . Miss Ruth Gaines of Meriden , New Hampshire , an expert spinner , has developed dyes for wool , Angora rabbit yarn , and linen thread . In addition to a number of special vegetable dyes , she has a particularly beautiful mineral vermilion and also a chrome ochre dye , a cinnabar , and other mineral colors . Writing in the Chronicle of the Early American Industries Association , of May , 1941 , Miss Gaines describes a " little exhibit from my farm in New Hampshire which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for one of the informal meetings of the Association held at Wiggins Old Tavern : " It consisted of a wicker basketful of yarns , hand spun and hand dyed , together with a tray of dyes hastily gathered in the autumn fields : brown plush butternuts ; sun flower seeds , in their round , dried , containers ; magenta sumac spikes ; grey tips of the same , like antlers in the velvet ; crimson-thorned blackberry stems ; coral madder roots ; goldenrods , canary yellow ; and , added to these , mineral dyes our ancestors used . . . chrome ochre , and hematite ? that primitive red which decorated with war paint the bronze skin of the Indians before we used it to color our barns and farm houses and flannels with an illusion of warmth . Almost unnoticed , I laid in a tiny skein of Upland , home-grown flax . " In her search for information about home dyeing , Miss Gaines // corresponds with a number of craftsmen throughout the United States who use vegetable dyes . One of these is Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own madder bed and experiments widely with dyes from native plants of Oregon . Another scholarly experimenter was Miss Lucy Cabot of Boston , a statement of whose formulas and experiences is now in the hands of John Ralph Geddis and Francois Martin , dyers , spinners , and weavers of originality , and puppeteers , whose skill in the last-named craft is described elsewhere . Besides her outstanding experiments with New England dye materials , Miss Cabot also worked with Indians , especially those of the Southwest , in efforts to recover some of their old formulas and to help them develop new colors for their textiles . Extensive vegetable dyeing was done in Deerfield , Massachusetts , at the beginning of the century by members of the Society of Blue and White Needlework who , being unable to buy the colors they wished for their thread and yarn , developed their own palette . Further reference to their work is made in Chapter 11 . Cushings dyes , made at Dover-Foxcraft , Maine , are generally used in Mrs. Pearl McGown 's classes because she considers them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been worked out , and dyed strips for separate flowers , figures , and even for extensive rug patterns in different color combinations are produced . But the use of vegetable dyes in preparing material for rugs was shown in 1945 at Worcester by some of Mrs. McGown 's pupils . One of these experimenters , Miss Anna M. Boynton , from Maine , wrote : I was pleased to learn that you noticed the vegetable dyeing , for I was very much intrigued with it . It was purely a matter of its capturing my interest , for it is infinitely easier to open a package of dye and get it over in half an hour or so , whereas with the vegetable dyes you have to make your decoctions and then still go through the process . I once shared a camp in a rather isolated place , with a friend , so I tried some experiments with what was around me . I used first Alder bark , and got some lovely golds with that , reddish golds . Then the Poplar bark gave paler tones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dye , but I found that sarsaparilla berries , which grew in profusion in the neighboring fields , stained my hands deeply whenever I touched them , so I made a lot of that decoction . I got some lovely dull plum shades , and had one very interesting accident . I wanted some paler shades , so I was adding rags at intervals after part of the dye was // taken up . I forgot to rinse the soap out of one piece after I washed it , and it turned the whole batch a lovely shade of pale green . I suppose it was some chemical action of the lye in the soap . There were literally acres of goldenrod about me , so I tried that . It gave some very rich shades of clear yellow , rather on the canary , and the flowers do make very powerful dye . One of my loveliest shades came from rhubarb roots , a beautiful bronze or old gold shade , very powerful dye . I also got some bronzy green from cedar tips . My interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Sun , issue of August 3 , 1942 , describing the work of Mrs. Chester G. Marsh with the Girl Scouts . She was teaching them to dye clothing and yarns with natural dyes , but I have never been interested to use them for anything but rug material . In Connecticut the group of workers in the Bridgeport Housing Company , led by William II . Ham , experimented extensively with vegetable dyes in connection with their weaving project described earlier . Old recipes yielded vegetable colors with which a large amount of yarn was dyed . " Some of our best results , " reports Mr. Ham , " were with the local Iceland moss , walnut shells , maple and oak bark , birch bark , alder bark , and local lichens . We used many other materials and prepared samples for 190 colors , some of these very permanent as shown by tests by the Bureau of Standards in Washington . " DECORATING SURFACES Methods of applying color other than by immersion include wood and linoleum blockprinting on cloth or on paper ; stenciling ; freehand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the silk-screen process known as serigraphy ; illuminating and other arts of the book ; and possibly other processes . In referring to blockprinting , that is , the transfer of a design from the face of a block to a textile or other material , the term " linoleum block " should usually be substituted for " wood block " because materials so decorated in New England today are being printed largely from linoleum blocks . Blockprinting on Fabric Linoleum blockprinting in New England owes a great deal to experience gained in the Connecticut Work Projects Administration , an undertaking which through its several craft units exerted wide influence on taste and standards of workmanship . Organized mainly to provide employment , the blockprinting unit was so well managed from its headquarters at Stamford that , soon after classes were formed , // a demand for curtains , table covers , upholstery material , and wall decorations came from many public institutions . So many persons learned how to do such work that the project became an important factor in utilizing the unemployed during the prewar depression . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Eleanor B. Finch was state supervisor of crafts . The Stamford Crafts Project was under the direct supervision of Mrs. Nellie B. Burow , already referred to as a weaver . The major part of the designing was done by Mrs. Myra W. Rankin and Mrs. Marion R. Voorhees . Mrs. Rankin , a graduate of the Art Institute of Chicago , and a designer of wide practice and versatility , brought to her work a sense of humor not often found in the general field of design . Some of her subjects have a whimsical quality in addition to charming color combinations . The gay and colorful designs by Mrs. Voorhees of Hamburg also have an original , playful quality . The work of both these designers extended to the making of patterns for hooked rugs , in which the Connecticut project achieved a high record in both design and craftsmanship . One of these large hooked rugs and a few wall hangings are illustrated . Among the best-known blockprinters of our country are the Folly Cove Designers of Annisquam , near Gloucester , Massachusetts . This group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia Demetrios from a class in design which she conducted . Mrs. Demetrios , who is a skillful designer , and an illustrator of children 's books , continues to teach the members of the group , and is sometimes assisted by Mrs. Aino Clarke , her first pupil . The group consists of about twenty-five designers , all residents of Cape Ann . A yearly exhibition and sale is held in Rockport in which all members cooperate to make the occasion beautiful and pleasurable , as well as conducive to sales . According to a letter received from the secretary in 1947 : " Each designer is required to make and print his or her designs . They must be original work . In order to maintain the quality , each design bearing the name , Folly Cove Designers , must be approved by a jury of five of the more experienced members of the group . " Names of some of the designs are A Country Fair , Noah 's Ark , Calendar Wall Hanging , The Farm , Merry-Go-Round , Horse and Buggy , The Circus , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird subjects . Some are reminiscent of earlier days ? American designs with native roots in our own past . At the Worcester Handicraft Exhibition a special cottage alcove was decorated with hand-blocked wall fabric designed and printed by Mrs. Louise Kenyon // of the Folly Cove Designers , and the window drapery was a textile , The Gossips , a design created by Mrs. Demetrios . The products of the group , now sold in several large stores throughout the country , include wall hangings , curtain fabrics , luncheon sets , tablecloths and napkins , scarfs , skirts , aprons , dresses , and blouses . Mrs. Gladys Wilkins Murphy of Fall River , Massachusetts , has done textile printing from linoleum blocks and , in addition to making blocks for hand production , has prepared designs for manufacturing in quantity . Hers were among the blockprint textiles shown at the Worcester Exhibition . During the summer Mrs. Murphy and her husband , Herbert A. Murphy , conduct a shop and gallery in Rockport , in which they display their blockprints and paintings . Blockprinting on Paper Carl Tait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Beverly , Massachusetts , has achieved a wide reputation with Christmas and other cards printed by hand from linoleum blocks in from two to four colors . Trained as an artist in the Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences , the question of making a living was the practical one which he faced when he completed his art courses . He drew several designs of uniform size , used as few blocks as possible to get pleasing results , and developed a technique of rapid printing by hand which enabled him to sell the cards at an unusually low price . His pictures are more like those of the French artist , Henri Reviere , than anything yet developed in this country , although he had never seen any of Reviere 's prints . Most of his work is done in three colors . His subjects are flowers , seashore scenes taken at Rockport and Gloucester , Christmas scenes and motifs , and a number of others . Mr. Tait does all th A processes himself ? designing , cutting the block , mixing and applying the colors ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was interrupted by army service , but he has since resumed his card-printing , now using the silk-screen technique , and has brought out several new designs , some in brilliant colors . Miss Ruby G. Allen of Antrim , New Hampshire , uses linoleum blocks for the printing of nature subjects . She records flowers and animals native to the state on small cards appropriate for Christmas and other occasions . She often demonstrates the processes at the annual Craftsman 's Fair of the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts . We shall mention only two other linoleum blockprinters in New England , both identified with the printed word . Fritz L. Amberger has it well-planned but almost miniature rural printshop a few miles // from Washington Depot , Connecticut . The press is in a room barely large enough to hold it and its ample owner . Mr. Amberger makes linoleum block Christmas cards of his own design cut by hand and printed in his shop , but he also combines blockprints for display cards and posters , which he runs off on his small press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and select colors which he runs separately from the printed matter , giving the whole an original and interesting effect . Sometimes if he wishes to print a large poster he will feed it into his small press four times , once for each corner . When finished it looks as unified as a single printing could have made it . Running four or more impressions in order to complete a design is more economical for him , Mr. Amberger says , than supporting a shop with large presses . Mrs. Amberger does much of the typesetting . Although Mr. Amberger 's printshop is located far in the country , he works also for some large industrial enterprises . For the local trade he makes letterheads , billheads , statements , and so forth . Thus the tradesmen and storekeepers of Washington Depot are supplied with printed forms that they are proud to use . Good taste costs no more in the village than in the city , and here , with overhead cut down to a minimum , it is really to be had for less . This rural American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the 1700 's and perhaps earlier in the little Alpine republic . Among several Swiss keepsakes Mr. Amberger displays in his shop an almanac done in the printing house of his grandfather in Zurich . He prizes above all the original type stick which his father gave him when he left Switzerland for America , with strict instructions as to how to use it . One of the most interesting examples of linoleum blockprinting ever done in our country is the first copy of Found Horizon 's Herald , conceived , written , edited , illustrated , cut from one block , and printed by Frederick Robbins , an early member of the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts . Mr. Robbins , or " Robby , " as his friends call him , lived at the time in Alexandria , about six miles from the town of Bristol , New Hampshire , and carried on his work in the small house which he built for himself , much of his living coming from his garden . A reproduction of Found Horizon 's Herald is shown . The linoleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches , a very impressive spread . " Of course , " said Mr. Robbins , " a linoleum block could be yards in length if there was a reason for it . " When Mr. Robbins had prepared the text , which gave the neighborhood news , and had laid out the illustrations , which recorded local scenes , he cut the entire A2 HANDICRAFTS OF NEW ENGLAND ext and illustrations on one block and printed them with one impres ; ion on his large etching press ; he then carried the finished papers from his cabin to Bristol on his bicycle . From here he shipped them : o the Craftsman 's Fair at Dartmouth College . The printing of the newspaper still goes on . Mr. Robbins writes the text , prints it by hand , and draws in the illustrations ; but to save time he now has the original material reproduced in a zinc linecut through arrangement with a country newspaper office . Thus , while mechanically the later numbers are not wholly a one-man product , they retain much of the individuality , freshness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England several excellent wood engravers who cut their design on the end grain of the wood and print the image usually on paper . One of these , a craftsman of unusual originality and skill , is Herbert Waters of Campton , New Hampshire , who is mentioned here because he often demonstrates at the annual Craftsman 's Fair of the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts . Although we regret that we can not include in this book references to the work of New Englanders in the graphic arts , especially those eminent in the field of typography , it is pleasant to be able to include as craftsmen , in quite diverse fields , at least three men who stand very high in the printing arts . Bruce Rogers of New Fairfield , Connecticut , whose work in typography is known and admired throughout the world , is referred to in Chapter 16 , where his singing cuckoo weathervane is described ; William A. Dwiggins of Hingham , Massachusetts , famous for his type designs , decorations , and illustrations , and book designing , appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his fine calligraphy ; and Carl Purington Rollins , Printer Emeritus to Yale University , who has long been interested in handicrafts , is mentioned here as both the designer and maker of a small working model of the famous Gutenberg printing press , the first to use movable type . Stenciling as a Process Stenciling is an old art practiced in America in colonial days and by skilled craftsmen in one form or another up to about the middle of the nineteenth century . Now it is being revived as a popular art , and it would probably be accurate to say that , with the exception of rug-hooking and needlework , more New Englanders practice some form of stenciling combined with painting for decoration than any other craft . The revival of stenciling and what we shall call decorative painting is but a part of the new and wide interest in many forms of home decoration . Although credit for the - revival must go to a // number of pioneer teachers in New England , it is hardly possible to overestimate the influence of the research , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose definitive and delightful book , Early American Decoration , is clearly instructive as to each process in stenciling . It includes remarkably adequate photographs , drawings , and color plates . A Memorial Exhibition of Mrs. Brazer 's work and of some of the best examples done by her pupils was shown in Springfield , Massachusetts , at the Eastern States Exposition in the fall of 1947 , and later as a part of the Exhibition of Maine Crafts and Decorative Arts in Portland , Maine . This is a continuing memorial exhibition with educational and aesthetic potentialities . According to Webster , a stencil is " a piece of thin sheet metal , parchment , paper , or the like , so perforated that when it is laid on a surface and color or ink is applied , a desired figure is produced . " The process may be as simple as cutting a hole through a piece of paper , or it may be as elaborate as having a dozen or more stencils to be used in completing a single composition . Stencilers apply their craft to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chairs , benches , tables , beds , boxes , metal trays , and any number of household conveniences , and even walls , ceilings , and floors . of amateurs and professionals is very long . Of those known to the writer comparatively few can be named here owing to lack of space . A Few New England Stencilers Among those who combine taste and skill in excellent proportion , Donn Sheets of New Milford , Connecticut , ranks high . As a decorator and designer , Mr. Sheets has added interest and charm to many a room in New England by his artistry in applying stencils to furniture and to parts of plastered walls . His work in metal and wood is also distinguished . In New Hampshire regular courses in stenciling given for several years by the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts have trained many persons to apply this craft successfully . Among the members of the League William P. Dudley of Exeter is perhaps best known for the extent to which he has developed the art of stencil and freehand painting . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color and form . Mr. Dudley is always represented at the annual Craftsman 's Fair , and the pieces which he lent for the Handicraft Exhibition at Worcester showed a wide variety of technique . In the state of Maine Mrs. Adele E. Ells has carried out many important commissions in stenciling and has also served as a regular // instructor in the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts . Mrs. Ells applies her stencils to various kinds of surfaces from living- and dining-room walls to the smallest piece of furniture . Many of her designs are original and among them are scenes of local interest . One which she did for her own house in Eliot includes likenesses of the lobster fisherman 's wife , the tax collector , and other local characters . She has also made a series of stenciled scenes of the town of York , which she worked out on valance boards in one of the rooms in her home . She used a similar design on the furniture of a neighbor . The local landmark of Eliot , Newell 's Bridge , is represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stenciling in New England is done on tin , some of it on large or small trays , boxes , and other objects . During the war the difficulty of getting tin for decorating was almost unsurmountable , but there were certain New Englanders who were able to overcome the handicap , at least in part . Among these were L. B. Worthly , a tinsmith and plumber of Johnson , Vermont , who made his own trays and boxes and decorated them ; Mrs. Lenda W. Gove of Burlington , who became interested in stenciling through an adult education class , exhibited in Worcester in 1943 a tray made of maple syrup cans ; and Mrs. Arthur Chivers of Hanover , New Hampshire , exhibited also at the Worcester show several trays made from ordinary tin cans . A number of craftsmen in Rhode Island decorate tin trays and other objects . Mrs. Arthur B. Holmes of Kingston specializes in stenciled trays . At Worcester , Mrs. Exene Meyersham of Barrington exhibited a tray with floral design ; Mrs. Delos A. Howland of Cranston showed two trays ; Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Miss Miriam Spicer of Providence 1 showed painted chairs , trays , and toleware . Free-Brush Painting Even more extensive than stenciling in New England is the freebrush painting of articles of household use , furniture , and the interior decorations of the home . Often free-brush painting and stenciling are combined , but there are a large number of craftsmen who do only decorative painting ; the few selected from among these will illustrate the wide practice of the art in this region . Peter Hunt , of Provincetown on the Cape , is probably the bestknown decorative painter in the New England states . For several years he and his associates have turned out a great number of objects of all forms with gay peasant decorations , including many pieces of furniture that have found their way to all harts of the country . Up in Calais , Vermont , Rome Van Ornam and his brother run a // little farm , where they raise much of their food and specialize in Toggenburg goats . Rome was once a sign-painter and carriage ' striper . Sign-painting he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he was paid fifty cents a day and boarded himself . He has done most of the post office signs in the Calais region of Vermont . He and his brother used to play the fiddle and organ for country dances and other social events . Now Rome spends considerable time in decorating furniture . Mrs. Ruth G. Mould of Williamstown , Vermont , a member of a talented family , is a decorator whose designs are usually original ; she also teaches . Her abilities are reflected throughout her home ; the treads on her stairway are covered with attractive pieces of hit-andmiss hooked carpet , the risers painted to harmonize with the carpet . Mrs. Mould is also an accomplished portrait painter , and among her interesting local subjects are Mrs. Will Davis , " Aunt Essie , " the hooked-rugmaker of Johnson , Vermont , referred to earlier . Mrs. Deering Edson of Lebanon , New Hampshire , has decorated many pieces of furniture . One notable example was a large chest shown at the Craftsman 's Fair in Portsmouth , which was copied from an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other free-brush decorative painters are Mrs. Bertha S. Dobrien , Brockton , Massachusetts , and Mrs. Marion Y. Greene , Boston , both of whom do work for the Society of Arts and Crafts . Mrs. Emily Gordon , also of Boston , decorates furniture for the Women 's Educational and Industrial Union , and was represented at the Worcester show . Mrs. Katherine F. Arms and Mrs. Wesley B. Foss , Deerfield , members of the Society of Deerfield Industries , do decorative painting . Mrs. Lois Warren of Amesbury , Massachusetts , exhibited four trays , each quite different , in Worcester . Miss Pauline Hopkins of Guilford , Connecticut , is a professional painter but has adapted her skill both to wood and metal decoration . Mrs. Katherine Lusk of Unionville , Connecticut , has decorated many Hitchcock chairs and is well known for her tolework , of which examples were shown at Worcester . Edward Paine of Mason Island , Mystic , Connecticut , makes a specialty of screens . Mr. and Mrs. William E. Brigham of Providence have also painted a number of fine screens for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was well represented in the exhibition of Maine Crafts and Decorative Arts at Portland in 1947 . Decorating on Glass Throughout New England are craftsmen who specialize in painting clock faces and decorating glass doors and other parts of clock cases . Much of this work is done by stencils and in part by freehand painting . i // Mrs. Mary E. Stephenson of Plainville , Connecticut , does fine reproductions and restorations of clock glasses , mirrors , also hand-painted trays , and so forth . It is , however , her decoration on glass in clocks for which she is best known . This is a technique requiring special judgment and skill , for the scenes are painted on the back of the glass , to be viewed through the opposite side in just the reverse from ordinary painting . As someone put it , " Everything has to be done backward . " Mrs. Stephenson 's father , William B. Fenn of Plymouth , Connecticut , who had charge of all the decorating in the Seth Thomas Clock Company at Thomaston , was among the outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large and rare collection . of stencils used by him . She has devoted herself since 1917 largely to the accurate reproduction and restoration of old painted clock and mirror glasses and trays , and has done some exceptionally fine designs for mirrors . Her subjects are flowers , scenes , and conventional designs , some of which are embellished with a gold-leaf border . Also connected with the traditional decorating of clocks is Mrs. Kathleen W. Laumann . She is the daughter and successor of Edward E. White of the Old Curiosity Shop in Belmont , Vermont . She continues to make up stencil sets as he did , and also teaches stenciling . She writes , " I have added many nice old patterns , copying and preserving any possible original that I find on old chairs and trays . " High on the hills above the village of South Royalton , Vermont , Miss Josephine E. Miller lives on an old farm settled in 1785 . The farm commands a beautiful view which Miss Miller often interprets , sometimes through the difficult medium of reverse painting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has mastered through the encouragement of Mrs. Eugene C. Rhodes . Miss Miller as a child , suffered from infantile paralysis , but through work with her hands she has created many objects of interest and beauty , some of which she sells . IT . N. Bunker of Brewer , Maine , a clock repairer and collector , painted and stenciled a number of attractive faces for old clocks and also made cabinets to house them . Miss Beulah True of Hancock Point , just before she died at the age of ninety , did a painting of the Mayflower at sea , which Mr. Bunker set in a clock he had repaired . E. W. Bartlett of Cornish ( Old Dingleton ) , New Hampshire , taught himself as a young man to paint and to work in wood . While he was making a mirror frame for Mrs. Augustus Saint-Gaudens of Cornish , she suggested that he might enjoy painting on glass in the traditional technique . 1Ic experimented and found this a very congenial medium in which to work . Some of his original paintings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these he whittles special frames , finishing the work carefully in tones that harmonize with the paintings . John Copps , a retired salesman who lives near Bedford , Massachusetts , is now over eighty-five years of age . He thinks he should not make too many plans for the future but always has something to be done on his workbench . His interest in crafts began a few years ago when a friend brought him an old mirror to repair . He soon started making reproductions of mirror frames , using old woods from his former New Hampshire home . His wife and daughter help him with the glass-painting and laying on gold leaf . Mr. Copps , who does all the work of his apple orchard , even spraying the trees , was picking apples on the day of our visit . Stenciling and painting on glass is carried on by Mrs. Dorothy Weir Ely of Old Lyme , Connecticut , who learned her craft in a Czechoslovak factory . She began by de-orating tumblers and other forms of glass with sport motifs , which were very popular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method by which she could apply her design to the glass with a stencil , and by using a heat-resisting mineral pigment she was able to fire the glass and so make the decoration permanent . This method has increased both the value and the demand for her product . A variant of the usual decorating on glass is seen in the work of Mrs. C. E. Anderson of Holyoke , Massachusetts , who uses tinfoil almost entirely for her beautiful floral compositions . This decoration , like much of the glass-painting for clock doors is put on in reverse . Mrs. Anderson is as careful in selecting her frames as in her pictures , often using the handsome old walnut frames in oval form . Decorating Boxes There is a special method of decorating pasteboard boxes which should probably come under this section of decorating surfaces , although instead of stenciling , wood blockprinting , or free-brush painting , the effect is achieved by decorative papers carefully pasted on the object . An interesting revival of a very old handicraft of this kind is carried on by Fred B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique dealer has acquired a fine collection of old wallpapers . He has developed the skill of decorating bandboxes with these papers very much after the style employed by the famous pioneer in this field , Miss Hannah Davis of Jaffrey , New Hampshire , on her wooden boxes two generations ago . The boxes Mr. Tuck covers are usually old forms , although there are some that are modern , and the decorations with // fragments of the old papers from walls of the fine homes of New England are often handsome . At Windsor , Vermont , H. L. Rockwood uses wallpaper to decorate boxes which he markets through outlets in New York . Mr. and Mrs. R. D. Snively of Colerain , Massachusetts , both good country craftsmen and excellent photographers , make special photographs and apply them as attractive decorations on wastepaper baskets and other receptacles . Some craftsmen apply maps to the outside of boxes , wastepaper baskets , and so forth , often giving them an antique finish . Serigraphy One of the newest developments in the art of transferring designs to surfaces is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicolor stencil process and one of the most elastic yet to be invented in the entire history of the graphic arts . In using it a silk cloth is stretched tightly over a wooden frame and stencils are drawn of that part of the design which is to be transferred . Other parts of the composition are stopped out , that is , filled up . The pigments are then spread on the screen and forced through the open areas with a squeegee . One advantage of the process is that it can be used to print on almost any base ? paper , plastic , textiles , metal , and so forth , and the design can be repeated many times through the same screen . The widest and one of the most attractive uses of the medium by New England artists known to the writer is an extensive line of special wrapping papers in sheet form and some wallpapers developed under the direction of Miss Eleanor B. Finch of Clinton , Connecticut , already mentioned in connection with the Crafts Project of the WPA of that ? , state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the , Book Among the fine traditional craftsmen of the United States , Miss Elisabeth H. Webb of Mystic , Connecticut , achieved a high place in the field of hand lettering and illumination . Fortunately a comprehensive collection of her work has been preserved in the Newark Art Museum , where students of calligraphy , illumination , and fine bookbinding can study it at leisure and with profit . Miss Webb developed an early interest in the arts of the book , and her father , appreciating her feeling , sent her to England , where she studied lettering and writing under the great English master , Edward Johnston . Miss Webb soon found her interest centering in the techniques practiced by the scribes and illuminators of the fourteenth and // fifteenth centuries ; she used gold , vermilion , and other materials much as they were used in that day . In her studio at Mystic , Miss Webb wrote , printed , illuminated , and bound her work , doing every part of it with the conscience and accuracy of the free craftsman . She referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Grace of God . " Examples of her work are to be found in different parts of the United States , one of the best known and one of her last being the baptismal service book made for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York . Calligraphy in New England is admirably represented by John Howard Benson of Newport and Providence , Rhode Island . This everyman 's craft has descended to a low level in our time of mechanical devices for writing letters , but happily is now experiencing a revival of interest . Mr. Benson no only follows the best traditions in the practice of calligraphy in his studio and workshop in Newport , where he is also a notable stonecutter , but he teaches it and the art of lettering and design at the Rhode Island School of Design , Providence . Through his course in handwriting many students have learned to write legibly and beautifully as well . William A. Dwiggins has executed some of the finest pages and broadsides in the field of contemporary handwriting , and those who know American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topmost artists . Mr. Dwiggins , whose Caledonia type is used for the pages of this book , is especially noted for his happy and effective use of calligraphy , hand printing , and printing types . As a designer , craftsman , and writer , " Dwig , " as his friends call him , is equally versatile and delightful . Even the shortest list of calligraphers in New England should include the name of George F. Trenholm , whose study at 80 Boylston Street looks out over Boston Common . Here this distinguished worker in graphic arts creates many of his best designs in hand lettering and handwriting . Long a leading member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts , and the Society of Printers , his contribution to the arts of the book are outstanding . He has brought fine handwriting into many of his designs and uses it continuously in his personal communications . The appearance in 1947 of the book , An Old New England Village , extended the acquaintance of Charles D. Hubbard of Guilford , Connecticut , to thousands of people who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand writer . Author of the book , he also printed every page of it by hand and drew all the illustrations . Reproduced by offset , it has extraordinary interest and charm . Mr. Hubbard , L50 HANDICRAFTS OF NEW ENGLAND how past seventy , has the steady hand and the imaginative fire of youth , and his letters , always written by hand , are pages of beauty . He writes : " For several years I have admired the work of the old scriveners of long ago . It is possible , of course , to space letters more evenly than in printing from a type face . Then each letter is born for that particular place and has an individuality not possible in Drinting . I went to the trouble of learning some of the older alphabets such as uncial and Gothic and made my pens from reeds . " Mr. Hubbard is preparing , in the same way , a book to be called Camping in he New England Mountains , which he believes will be completed within two or three years . Associated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Black of Searsport , Maine , who takes pleasure in making his own ink and penholders . The ink is made from blackberries , blueberries , and elder bark ; the penholders from cattails after suggestion made by John Burroughs in a book Mr. Black was reading , entitled John Burroughs Talks : His Reminiscences and Comments as reported by Clifton Johnson . " I use , " says John Burroughs , " ordinary steel stub pens for writing , and my favorite penholders are those I make myself of cat-tails . I gather the cat-tails in the swamp , and when the stems are dry , I cut them up into the proper lengths . These penholders are very light and I can easily push the pens into the pith . Once I got a fountain pen and used it two or three days . Then I went back to my beloved cat-tail . That suited me best ... . Related to the arts of the book and belonging in this chapter because of the change wrought in the surface appearance of the paper are marbled and paste papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of floating pigments in liquid and transferring them to paper , is practiced by several New England bookbinders . A wide variety of decorative marbled papers was shown by Arno Werner of Pittsfield , Massachusetts , at a recent exhibition of bookbindings and figured papers in New York . Mr. Werner makes the papers in large sheets , uses them in his own work ; his fellow bookbinders have access to them . A less familiar method of paper decorating ? paste papers ? is accomplished by covering a sheet of paper with paste upon which a pattern is worked with some tool or by the fingers . Mrs. Rosamond B. Loring of Boston a few years ago sought suitable end papers to harmonize with her bookbinding and also to use as book covers . Being unable to find what she wanted , she undertook to make the decorative papers herself ; soon she became one of the foremost practitioners of the art . Her mastery of the subject is the // result of much practice and of intensive study . She has long been an enthusiastic collector of decorated papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples from worldwide sources . She has possibly the most nearly complete library on the subject in existence , in which every obtainable book is represented . Examples of Mrs. Loring 's own work form an important part of the collection . Many handbinders and makers of fine books use Mrs. Loring 's papers . She has written a comprehensive and scholarly book , Decorated End Papers , which is replete with historical data and clear explanations of a technique that she herself practices so successfully . Generous in sharing her experiences and ent s with others , she has helped many students along the happy r d this fascinating handicraft. // NEW ENGLAND POTTERY T HE words " pottery " and " ceramics " might be used interchangeably in this report , but pottery is given preference because it a good descriptive word familiar to most people and , like the handicraft itself , ancient in origin . Pottery in its broadest sense includes all earthy objects , from building bricks to fine dishes , which have been changed by fire from a pliable state of clay to a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not pottery although they may be on the way . Unless their form and substance are permanently changed through the process of firing , they will , when soaked in water or exposed to the elements , go back to mud again . Not only is pottery a very inclusive term , it carries a specific meaning within itself , so to speak , one which will serve us well here by separating the usual run of pottery from porcelain . This is a clear distinction which John Spargo of Bennington , Vermont , has made in his Early American Pottery and China . For practical purposes Spargo classifies all ceramic products under two main divisions , one to be called ' " pottery , " the other " porcelain . " Under pottery he includes all those earthy products which when held up to the light appear opaque , and under porcelain all ceramic products which appear translucent . Anyone can recognize these two main divisions . Some writers on ceramics make a third division by putting stoneware into a separate classification , placing it between pottery and porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That , however , is a rather technical classification which the layman can not recognize by the appearance of the piece . Therefore , since stoneware is opaque , it seems logical to classify it as Spargo does with pottery . Although the variety of forms , surfaces , and even uses of pottery seems infinite , processes employed in its making are comparatively few and easily understood . The materials are all taken from the surface or below the surface of the earth , clay forming the body of the myriad 152 // objects that man has made for his use and contemplation . The finishing coats or glazes , which give special color or smoothness or density and which render the piece waterproof , require other and usually harder mineral substances . All pottery is constructed or built by one of four processes : ( 1 ) It may be entirely hand built of coils , or ropes of clay , one coil laid upon the other and all pressed together before firing ; ( 2 ) it may be " thrown " or turned on a revolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing of pottery on a wheel being one of the most magic of all handicraft processes ; ( 3 ) it may be modeled with the hand and a few tools , a process by which a figure is built up as a sculptor would model his clay ; ( 4 ) the potter may us a mold into which the moist clay is pressed or into which a mixture of . v and water is poured and shortly poured off again , leaving a layer of the right thickness for the vessel or object desired . Certain cups and saucers , bowls , and much other tableware are poured in this way . Molding and pouring processes are used generally when objects exactly alike are to be made ; yet in some potteries , as we shall see , uniformity of shape and size is accomplished through skillful throwing on the wheel . The body of an object of pottery is often finished simply by firing it as soon as it has dried to the required hardness , as a garden flowerpot or a plain brick , but these forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is desired to make the pottery waterproof or to give it a smooth or hard surface , a glaze is prepared and applied either with a brush or sponge or by dipping or spraying the object . Then the piece is fired again and the glaze either fuses with the body or otherwise hardens into permanent , one might almost say everlasting , form . Of all the arts of man , pottery in its broad sense is one of the most enduring . The coloring of pottery may come through the firing of the clay at certain temperatures , through special glazes ( or glasses ) applied to the body , and in a few instances by means of some element used in the fire itself . In the last-named method certain hardwood ashes burned with the clay produce special colors . It is said that in attaining the intense black of the Ilde ? onso pottery of New Mexico , the Indians fire the pottery with sheep manure . The simplest form of ceramics or pottery in New England , as elsewhere , is the ordinary red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the clay is mixed and pounded to the right consistency ; it is then pressed into a mold ; and when dried out enough to handle , it is piled up in such a way that the stack of brick itself forms the kiln with openings or channels at the bottom , where fuel is // placed and " the kiln fired . " This makes a brick a ceramic product , but it is not an example of handicraft in the sense of this report ; that is , its character has not been determined by the touch of the hand . However , Mr. and Mrs. John Turnbull of Haddam , Connecticut , have through very elementary methods produced some bricks that are clearly within our definition of handicrafts . They had no wheel , no special kiln , no glazes , nothing for tools but simple sticks and a pocketknife . But , much in the spirit of children making mud pies , they incised and modeled common bricks into forms of interest and beauty . As a member of the office staff of a large brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the clay bank through the kiln . He watched the varied results of the firing on the outer , middle , and inner walls of the kiln , and conceived the idea of incising some simple patterns in the bricks while they were soft and before stacking ; the experiment would cost nothing except a little time and a few bricks . In this he had the cooperation of Mrs. Turnbull , an experienced designer . A wide variety of experiments in pottery making is going on in New England where kilns range from the simplest backyard oven , homemade and fired with wood , to the latest and most scientifically constructed studio kiln . Professor Randolph W. Johnston of South Deerfield , Massachusetts , and the Department of Art of Smith College , has invented a method for firing pottery and terra cotta by imbedding electric resistance wires in the clay body of the object to be fired , burying the object in a loose heat insulator such as asbestos , and connecting to a house circuit . The temperature is raised from within until the clay is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method for firing the molds for casting bronze sculpture , using the resistance wires in the same way . A photograph of Professor Johnston embedding a wire in a vase which he is molding is reproduced here . He has not confined himself to a single art ; his versatility embraces work in wood , stone , terra cotta , pottery , metals , stage design , and fresco painting . POTTERY IN MAINE It so happens that the Rowantrees Pottery , the farthest " Down East " of any in Maine , is of particular interest to us because it is a community undertaking concerned with both people and products . It was established in Blue Hill between Ellsworth and Bucksport in 1934 by Miss Adelaide Pearson , who built the first kiln there . She had worked in Boston settlement houses and had organized- folk handicraft classes NEW ENGLAND POTTERY and exhibitions among non-English-speaking immigrants . Lail cause of her interest in both social welfare and the arts she deb to provide for Hancock County cultural opportunities similar accessible in cities . Miss Laura S. Paddock , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depart Ceramics of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Arts was enlisted at once as a volunteer . Since that time Miss Padd had charge of the Pottery . When opportunity permits , she al Pearson travel extensively , gathering materials for their arts an museum , which is a mine of information . After a trip to India which included a fortnight 's visit with Mahatma Gandhi , the craft of pottery took on new dignity and meaning , and t achievements of Rowantrees Pottery began . In 1941 , according to Rowantrees records , $5,000 worth of pots sold , and the next year the business was doubled . Since that time put has increased annually . Over an acre of floor space was added and two new kilns were built . Thus the Pottery , established pi as a summer school for the community , has developed into a industry of permanence and stability . Eighteen craftsmen are in the plant ( as of 1947 ) , all natives of the township , which population of something over a thousand . An extraordinary feature that distinguishes Rowantrecs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clay used in the of the product is local , but the twenty or more glazes , beau luster and depth , are practically all evolved from ores and rock in the vicinity . The clay used in the body of the pottery fires ti It is given greater durability than is usual by firing at 2,000 Fahrenheit . According to the potters themselves , in a leaflet issued , " the foundation of all the glazes is Blue Hill white colored by copper ore ( greens , blues , and one red ) , manganese and lavender ) , and iron ( rich red ) . Other ingredients are fl quartz , lermondite , pegmatite , galena , diatoms , calcopyrite , calcined clamshells , which give the Rowantrees turquoise its 1 lustre . " The minerals used in the glazes are collected " from t shore , mountain top , abandoned mines , bottom of bogs , and e ponds , " and are ground to fine powder with all the impurities Each piece of pottery is wheel thrown or modeled by ha excellent shapes , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted designs are occasionally Rowantrees craftsmen often turn to sea or woodland for their tive motifs ; the deer is a favorite subject . On some of the co , jam pots and other dishes the forms of wild flowers and bet. : // modeled and glazed in nature 's colors . Wild strawberries , blueberries , cranberries , and other native berries with their foliage make delightful decorations . But one does not see the Pottery in full through its products alone , admirable as they are , or even as they express the joy in work of the potter . To get the complete picture one would have to go behind the immediate scene and view sympathetically the human elements which are so important . Not only has the Pottery brought a steady income to many in the community ; it has brought educational , social , and aesthetic values , which often attach to a handicraft when thoughtfully conducted . Mrs. Blanche Butler , for instance , a farm woman , who does not often go to the plant , models at home many of the attractive decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She modeled and glazed a miniature farmhouse and garden as a top for one of her own dishes . This was fired at the Pottery . Mrs. Butler is typical of thousands of rural women throughout our country who welcome opportunities for creative expression , and when she said , " I do not know what I would do without our Pottery " it was plainly not alone the economic return that she had in mind . All those who work steadily at Rowantrees are from families who have lived in that neighborhood for a long time . A surprising fact in this connection is that some of the workmen have become expert craftsmen after two or three years ' practice , but nearly all of them have used their hands in some kind of rural work from childhood , and children who have played around the Pottery take to it like ducks to water . There is probably no experience which exceeds in satisfaction that which one feels in creating some object of use or beauty , but ranking close to it is the satisfaction of having an indispensable part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not generally realized how important such an experience is to many individuals ; it comes out at Rowantrees in the keen feeling which the different workers have for their part in the entire product . They all know that a defect anywhere along the line spoils the work of all the others ; so from the men who grind the clay , to those who shape the pieces , and spray or brush on the glazes , all feel their responsibility and have a pride in the finished piece . Hardly a family in the village but is building up a dinner set of pottery , some part of which members of the family have made . Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Abbott live in a beautiful old rambling farmhouse on the slope of a low hill above the valley in South Berwick , York County . Here they carry on the Quamphegan Crafts of pottery and weaving . MI .. Abbott has developed an excellent product including stoneware , all clone with a rather high fire , giving the body great // strength . Form is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel . The glazes are low in color , beautiful in tone , and harmonious when shown together . In addition to single pieces of pottery which Mr. Abbott sells , he has made for home use a number of handsome and efficient baking dishes of clay native to Maine . Some of his pottery was shown with Mrs. Abbott 's weaving at the Exhibition of Contemporary New England Handicrafts in Worcester , and at a more comprehensive exhibition in the L.D.M. Sweat Memorial Art Museum at Portland , Maine , in 1947 . The combining of weaving and pottery as carried out by the Abbotts is one of the pleasantest achievements known to the writer in these two arts . While it is not often that weaver and potter are found in one family , it would frequently be possible for weavers and potters from different groups to work together . Mrs. Noah R. Bryan of Orono is contributing new and very attractive products in ceramics . She conceived the idea of interpreting native wild flowers and other plant motifs in the form of ceramic jewelry . The response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this field . The clay used is native and the firing is done in a small homemade kiln . Mrs. Bryan 's figures are often full of humor . One , a white horse ambling along with a flower pot filled with gay blossoms curled in his tail , she calls the Drunken Horse . It is an excellent piece of modeling and beautiful in color . Mrs. Bryan has named her home industry the Merry-Go-Round Pottery and uses as her trademark a horse from an old merry-go-round . Linnwood Pottery is the creation of Linn K. Phelan , whose studio was for several years at Saco , Maine , adjoining the house of the Maine Industries . Here he produced pottery of many shapes and sizes , including some large bowls and jars all wheel thrown . He prepared the clay , did the throwing and modeling , also the glazing , decorating , and firing . There is an individuality about the pottery not often attained by those who produce such a considerable volume of work , some of it in plates , bowls , cups and saucers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Mr. Phelan 's glazes ; and the other , his painted decorations . He developed a range of harmonious glazes , including grays , blues , a few greens , and some especially attractive yellows and blacks . His decorations , usually inspired by local subjects , are achieved through applying the slip with a brush . This has been done with such evident skill that the craftsman 's pride in his work is-shared by those who own an example of it . Richard Coolidge and Luigi Balestro conduct a tearoom and gift shop , The Dan Sing Fan , in Ogunquit during the summer months ; in the winter they find time to make a small but choice selection of // pottery . The objects are mainly for household decoration , and the potters use a few selected glazes , including blues and greens , which suggest old Persian pottery . Both craftsmen learned to make pottery at Greenwich House in New York as a hobby , and found at Ogunquit the opportunity to combine their hobby with business . Miss Margaret L. Vincent of Norway , Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces having gone to many parts of the country . She is also well known for her woodcarvings . Examples of her ceramics are on display , with other selected American pottery , at the Art Museum in Syracuse , New York . POTTERY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE Edwin and Mary Scheier of Durham came to the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts from the Southern Highlands . No two contemporary potters have made more progress in the development of ceramics in New England than these talented and enthusiastic artists . Most of their pieces are made on the wheel . They reflect not only qualities of skill and a high sense of beauty , but they are lively symbols of that " joy in work " which William Morris identified with art itself . Their pottery ranges from small simple cups in burnt red or gray earthenware to stoneware with the ring of metal . If decorations are employed beyond the simple and effective striping which follows the motion of the wheel , a characteristic of Scheier pottery , they often take a sculptural rather than painted form and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else these decorations may express , they invariably say to one who has a feeling for materials , " I am made of clay . " The Scheiers ' pottery is often the medium for delightful expressions of humor ; Adam and Eve on a cider jug or Juggled Babies modeled on a stoneware vase are typical examples . Mr. and Mrs. Scheier have received high recognition in national shows and competitions , but the best opportunity to enjoy their work is afforded by their demonstrations and exhibits in their adopted state of New Hampshire . One or both of them are almost always at the annual Craftsman 's Fair , where they demonstrate their work and often give others an opportunity to take part . At the Hanover Fair in 1941 they not only had an extensive and beautiful display of their own pottery , but they let school children work at all the processes . The Scheiers are experimenters ; they use materials of many kinds , their principal pieces being made of New Hampshire clay . For some years they have taught ceramics at the University of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Bailey of Hopkinton , // came into the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts through their blockprinting . After a few lessons in pottery , however , they decided that this was the medium for them . Their kiln and equipment have been ingeniously and inexpensively built by Mr. Bailey , who is known as a very practical Yankee . From the beginning he and Mrs. Bailey have operated a small workshop in their home , where they make their living by combining subsistence farming with pottery making . The pottery products , which have a utilitarian value , are in the form of attractive tableware , although a few very interesting larger pieces are made . The Baileys have developed markets through the League and other outlets . POTTERY IN VERMONT Mrs. Herta Moselsio of Bennington models and fires ceramic figures of high quality in both design and the technical and artistic use of glazes . Her best-known pieces are sculptural , although sometimes she makes objects of household utility . The work of Simon Moselsio , who is director of the Art Department of Bennington College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an outstanding instance of relating them to the life and work of college students . Mr. Moselsio is a sculptor of national reputation . He and Mrs. Moselsio are interested in both the fine and the minor arts ; they draw no arbitrary line between them and are particularly concerned with their educational and social values . Having learned the technique of motion-picture making , Mr. and Mrs. Moselsio have contributed some of the most valuable films on the arts and crafts yet produced in this country . One such film illustrating the processes of sculpture , or more specifically the process of making a portrait in sculpture , is an outstanding achievement . A typical Vermonter was chosen for the portrait . The motion picture opens with a long shot of this native resident making his way uphill in an old-time buggy , getting out at the sculptor 's studio , and arranging to sit for h i s portrait . All the processes of making the portrait , from Mr. Moselsio 's quick penciled strokes on the surface of the stone , the roughing out of the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the o completion of the sculptured study , are shown so that the observer , in the short space of half an hour , follows sequences which would require months if observed in the workshop , if indeed he could have the opportunity to see them . The culminating scene is thrilling when the Vermonter and the sculptured portrait of him in stone , a remarkable likeness , are shown on the screen together . // Mrs. Lydia K. Winston , whose home is in Michigan , spends her summers in West Dover and has done some notable experimenting with the local clay of Vermont in making pottery of high fire , approaching stoneware , examples of which were shown at the Worcester Exhibition . She has produced a vase of local red clay glazed with wood ashes from her own fireplace . POTTERY IN MASSACHUSETTS Massachusetts has produced more potters than any other New England state . At least four potteries more or less identified with the arts and crafts movement of the early years of this century made a lasting impression on New England ceramics . They were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Grueby Pottery of South Boston , and the Paul Revere Pottery of Brighton . They were all among the early " studio potteries " in our country . Marblehead Pottery was first started in connection with the sanitarium of Dr. Herbert J. Hall of Marblehead , and developed under the direction of Arthur E. Baggs , then a young potter of great promise . He made important contributions to the art of pottery in this country and was director of ceramics at Ohio State University at the time of his death . At Marblehead Mr. Baggs developed a very superior pottery which compared favorably with anything done then or since . The glazes are in low tones of gray , blue , green , yellow , red , and black , each a fine color in itself and all harmonizing when used together . It took the form of plates , bowls , cups and saucers , mugs , sugar bowls , creamers , and other articles for table use and household decoration , including ornamental tiles , which found their way into many American homes . Dedham Pottery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established at Chelsea prior to 1866 but moved later to Dedham . It was noteworthy for the experiments carried on there by its Scottish founder , especially for its popular blue and white crackleware . James Robertson , the fourth in line of a family of potters , came to the United States from Scotland in 1853 with three sons , one of whom , Hugh C. , was the true founder of the Pottery . The Pottery at Chelsea was started not far from Powder Horn Hill , where flowerpots , ferneries , and beanpots were made for a time but not until 1867 did it produce any painted or glazed decorations . In 1878 , however , the Pottery was awarded first prize by the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association . After 1884 , when Hugh carried on // the pottery works alone , he produced a fine apple-green glaze . He had seen at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876 the Korean exhibit , which included examples of Chinese crackle and also of Dragon 's Blood vases of the Ming Dynasty , known in England as oxblood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing this rich color . The experiments were so costly that they left Hugh penniless , and in 1889 the Pottery was closed . He had succeeded , however , in getting the fine red color of the original oxblood ( sometimes referred to as " Robertson 's Blood " ) and as a by-product of his experiments he learned how to make crackleware , which was to become famous . The pottery works were reorganized in 1891 with the financial backing of Boston men and women , and the development of blue crackleware with glaze decorations was undertaken . The dampness of Chelsea proving unsuitable to such work , the Pottery was moved to Dedham , with Hugh Robertson and his son , William A. , in charge . Production of crackleware began again in 1895 and together with Dragon 's Blood received high awards at Paris , San Francisco , and St. Louis . Hugh Robertson died in 1908 . He held the rank of master craftsman conferred by the Society of Arts and Crafts , of which he was a charter member . The Pottery continued to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crackleware with various charming designs by Denman W. Ross and Charles E. Mills . The rabbit pattern , devised by Joseph Linden Smith , became the firm 's trademark . The pottery works closed for the duration of World War II . Grueby Pottery of South Boston produced some of the finest examples of ceramics ever made in our country . Many of the forms were designed by Addison B. LeBoutillier , now of Rockport , and these fine shapes gave them immediate distinction ; most pieces were without decoration , although occasionally a stem and a bud of a plant would be modeled in low relief to give both the composition desired and the effect of one glaze color over another . The glazes , developed by William H. Grueby , were few but excellent , especially the blues , greens , and yellows , and the melonlike textures of both pottery and tiles have never been surpassed in American ceramics . Paul Revere Pottery was established and conducted for many years in the neighborhood of the Paul Revere house in Brighton . The objects made were chiefly tableware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced a new and interesting note in the development of small potteries in this country . The decorations were underglazed in many attractive colors ; the designs were usually incised ; the painting done freehand with an outline filled in with black .
