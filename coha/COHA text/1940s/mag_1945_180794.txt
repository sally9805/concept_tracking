While Premier T. V. Soong flew back to Chungking from apparently fruitful talks with Generalissimo Joseph Stalin in Moscow , the Yenan radio broadcast startling news . Last week in Yenan 116 delegates from all the Communist areas of north , south and central China met in plenary session . <P> Their purpose , said the Yenan radio , was to promote the national war effort against Japan , to give vigor to the democratic groups throughout China and the " formation of a coalition government as well as the liberation of the Chinese people . " The present meeting was only a preparatory committee to set the date and technical details for a full-dress conference of the people 's representatives of liberated China . <P> What did this mean ? TIME Correspondent Theodore White cabled from Chungking : " This was the first concrete move of the Communists to set up a government of their own . It meant that the Communists are now not only rejecting the current People 's Political Council in Chungking as a representative body of opinion , but are going further and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of today , the Communists no longer consider the promise of Chiang Kai-shek nor his proponent national assembly as an adequate program for unity ; and that they are on their own preparing to establish another national assembly . This would be based on the millions of people and vast areas that pay allegiance to their own standards . At the end of this long road lay the tragic picture of two Chinas sharing sovereignty of one people ; and from this could only result bloodshed and violence for untold years to come . " <P> The news shocked Chungking , where the People 's Political Council is in session . The National Government feared that Yenan might declare itself independent .
