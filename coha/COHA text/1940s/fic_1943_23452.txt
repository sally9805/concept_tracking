II THE CAPTAIN SLEEPS T HAT evening , while I was waiting my turn at the crowded desk of the Moana , in Honolulu , I heard my name spoken by Sansome , the man from the WPB . I recognized his New Hampshire accent and had no need to turn round to know that he 'd be prominently there , a very large man in a white suit and a bright blue shirt , a Panama hat pushed back on his thick mop of white hair , his clipped white mustache brilliant against his red face . " I 've wangled a car for to-morrow , " he said , " from Admiral Shorter . I 'm going to drive over the Pali Pass . Would you like to come along ? " " Thanks , " I said , " but I 'm afraid I ca n't go to-morrow . " " Too bad , " he said . " You 'd said you wanted to go . Anything important on to-morrow you ca n't shift ? " He made it all sound like a peacetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . One of the girls behind the desk called out to him . " Oh , there you are , Mr. Sansome . There 's a call for you . Will you take it in the office , please ? " " Thanks , Alice , " he said . He walked round the end of the desk and into the main office . I was still waiting my turn when he came out . " Well , " he said , coming up to the desk counter opposite me , " that 's that . Ca n't go either . Got to leave by plane from Hickam to-morrow , early . That your trouble too ? " " Come up to my room and have a drink , " I said . " We can talk there . " " All right , " he said . " That 's a good idea . " Up in my room I poured our drinks . " I do leave in the morning , " 1 said , " but I did n't want to discuss it down there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that make ? If they can let me know by phone over a hotel switchboard I ca n't see what 's so secret about it . You got to be at Hickam ? Five-thirty ? " " Yes , " I said . " And I 'm damned if I know how to get there at that hour . " " Ride out with me , " he said . " They 're sending a car for me at four-thirty . " " Thanks , " I said . " How did you get a car , for God 's sake ? I could n't even get a taxi . " " Oh , " he said , " I called General Brest-ford and he arranged it . Damn it , the Government sends me here and sends me there . Either I 'm important to them or I 'm not . TI I 'm not why the hell dots this crazy Administration send me ? If I am , I 'm worth a car . " He finished his drink and rose and went to my telephone and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Send a boy who can pack my clothes to my room , please . Right away . " He hung up the instant he was through speaking . " Should have asked Brestford what sort of plane it was , " he said . " Be interesting to know , " I said . I knew it was to be one of the new 8-24 's . " Thanks for the drink , " he said . " See you at four-thirty in the lobby . I 'll bet we get in charge of a lot of kids to-morrow . " " Why do you care ? " I asked . " Maybe it 's true what they say about kids flying , " he said , " but I think it 's a lot of nonsense . How in hell d' you expect to get responsibility and care at nineteen and twenty ? " " You get it , " I said . " Maybe , " said Sansome . " Anyway , I hope they do n't get stuffy about excess-baggage weight . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the tunics of my uniform and my neckties ( I 'd not want them again till I got back from the southwest Pacific ) , leaving out a sweater , a raincoat , and a light windbreaker . Then I went to bed . I rather hoped I 'd not be on the same plane with Sansome . He made the war seem like a Republican protest . I wondered if it was his not being in uniform that made him so down on the " It.ids , ' as he called them . An Army corporal in a Command car drove us slowly out to Hiekart , Field . It was pitch dark , for the moon ( that earlier had made visible silver of the thin clouds crowning the Windward Mountains ) had set , and the blackout was complete . Even at this hour traffic was heavy . Sansome , dressed now in gray flannels , urged the young Corporal to more speed . " We 'll never have time for a cup of coffee , " he said . " Ca n't go no faster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God-damned pedestrians do n't carry no lights . " " They should n't let them walk all over the road at this hour , " said Sansome . " Certainly not without lights . " " Flashlights is hard to get , " said the Corporal . " I got one , " said Sansome . " I had no trouble . " " You must of got it from an Army PX then , " said the Corporal . " Did n't know they 'd sell to a civilian . " " Oh , yes , " said Sansome . " I wangled it without too much trouble . " To me he said , " I bought two . They 're hard to get at home . I got some extra batteries too . I must try to get a pair of these Marine boots . I could use them at home ; they 're wonderful . And no coupons needed . " We turned in to the gate at Hickam just then and had to produce our credentials , so I was saved from answering . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait in a large room , with about twenty other passengers , all in uniform . I asked about coffee but was told there was no time for that . After a few minutes Sansome disappeared . We were all loaded on a large open truck by the time he reappeared . He climbed nimbly up on it . " You should have come with me , " he said . " I got hold of the officer in charge , who 's old enough to know what 's what , and I threw Westford at him and he took me across to that but over there , and we had coffee and toast . " " All the comforts of home , " I said . " While they last , " he said and laughed . The truck drove up and down the long runways in the first gray light of the dawn , between dispersed planes , and stopped to discharge its passengers , sometimes two , sometimes three , to a bomber . All the planes to go were Liberators and theylooked new . Sansome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck stopped at our bomber the light had increased enough so that we could see faces clearly . There were five men grouped by the after belly-hatch of the plane . We jumped down and I pulled my knapsack and my duffel bag off the truck . Sansome looked about him . " AIl your baggage out ? " called the truck driver . " No , " said Sansome " I 'll help you , " I said . Together we pulled his two large and heavy suitcases and his satchel off the truck . " Had n't been for that officer at the hangar , " he said , " I 'd have had trouble about excess weight . " " Yes , " I said . " I guess you would . If you have to lug these much you 'll be sorry . " " You can always find someone to do it , " he said . " My God , look at these kids . " " O.K. ? " called the driver . " O.K. , " I yelled back . The truck drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane detached himself from the others and came toward us . He wore old brown coveralls , and his head was bare , but I noticed captain 's bars on his shirt collar under the coverall . " How de do , " he said . " My name 's Buford . Leslie Buford . I 'm the skipper . " We introduced ourselves and he then introduced the rest of his crew . There was Flight Officer Dresden , his co-pilot , and Lieutenant Floyd , the navigator , and Sergeant Eastley , the radio man , and Corporal June , the engineer . The light was growing then and I saw that they were all of them very young , as Sansome had predicted . But the Captain was the one who caught my full attention . He was about five foot six and slight of build . He had delicate hands and wrists , almost like a woman 's . His hair was light brown and exceedingly curly and of fine texture . His face was the face of a little boy , with a smiling , pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a movie queen , and his cheeks were round and soft and so pink that they made me think of the way a small child looks when it first wakes from sleep . I could see that Sansome was looking at him too . I thought to myself , I 've got to go a quarter of the way around the world , over an ocean at war , flown by this child , who is aided by these children . But I said nothing of that . " We 'll get aboard , I guess , " said Buford . " Hand your stuff up to me , " said Corporal June , and he ducked under the plane 's tail and disappeared up into the open hatch . I lugged my duffel bag under and heaved it up to him and handed up my knapsack . As I stood there Buford handed me Sansorne 's two big suitcases and his satchel , and I heaved them up to June , who stowed them . Then I climbed in . Through the gun window ( its machine gun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see Sansome , his hat off , the breeze ruffling his white hair , talking to the other men . Buford yelled at them . " Come on , " he said . " We do n't want to be last off . " They came through the hatch and disappeared through a small door forward . When Sansome was at last aboard Corporal June closed the hatch door . " You follow me , " he said . " I 'll show you where to sit for the take-off . No smoking at all except in the flight cabin . You can come up there one at a time when we 've been going an hour . You can come back here as soon as we are well off the ground . Follow me , sir , " he said to me . He walked forward on the corrugated-metal floor , climbed over a huge packing case lashed to the ribs , and went through the little door into the catwalk of the bomb-bay . It was very dark and very narrow and one had to crouch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a place , " said Sansome . June reached the end of the catwalk , lifted a sliding panel at the height of his chest , turned to face us and , seizing a bar inside the flight cabin ( on the floor of which the slide panel seated ) , he lifted himself swiftly and easily inside . The four motors started , one after the other . " Sit right there , " he said . " No smoking at all . " He had to shout now . " In an hour , " he yelled , pointing to the cabin . " One at a time . " Then he drew in his feet and shut the slide . We sat on the metal catwalk . Through the wide cracks in the bomb doors one could see the earth , and dusty air swept through the cracks , moved by the propellers . You could hardly hear yourself think . Sansome was directly behind me . The air smelt strongly and sickeningly of gasoline . Presently we began to move , taxied a long distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , quite suddenly , we began our takeoff . I had never before been in a four-motored plane , and it was just luck that I was braced well and had a grip for my hands or I 'd have been flung backward . I watched the ground ( so very close to me ) tear past . and then we were in the air . I waited five minutes , to he sure , and then rose to go aft to the tail compartment . Sansome had left already and was installed there , looking out one of the side windows . I took up a position at another . I had to stoop to see out of it . I watched till the island of Oahu had disappeared . It was a fine sight from the air . The continuous clouds over the mountains cast finely shaped shadows on the green curves and ravines below them . When the land was out of sight I watched the sea . It seemed then a very big sea , but not so big as it seemed later on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for a smoke , " he shouted . I looked at my watch . It was three-quarters of an hour since we had left the ground . I pointed to my watch and shouted , " Fifteen minutes . " " The hell with that , " he yelled . " Those kids . " And he went forward . He climbed the packing case with ease and grace and disappeared through the little door . Moved by curiosity , I went forward and observed his progress . He lifted the sliding panel and for a while he stood there , and I could see June squatting down to talk to him , pointing to his watch . But in a moment Sansome turned and seized the bar inside and hoisted himself up and the panel shut . I put him out of my mind and watched the sea , some ten thousand feet below . It was like no sea that I had ever seen before . It was a fine clear cobalt blue , but over it was laid a palpable glaze of cerulean , as though one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , the far-off clouds reflected as though the sea were calm ; in the small lavender shadows of the warm-tinted little clouds the sea was wrinkled by wind and full of shifting lights , like a piece of watered silk in motion . The more I looked at it the bigger the sea became , and I thought of Captain Buford and grinned . He was awfully young . Everything in the interior of the plane spoke of its newness . Its hull was clean and shiny ; the complex wiring was of many bright , clear , unspotted colors  --  yellow and red and green and black . Even the silvery corrugated floor ( impossible to sit on with comfort ) was unscratched in some places . The guns were new and their barrels still dull in finish . All this  --  this bright complexity and deadliness , this beautiful , condensed weapon , this expensive , flowing , swift thing  --  was going halfway round the world under the guidance of Buford . It made me feel rather queer . Toward eight o'clock June came through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gasoline . Then he came back , over the packing case , to me . His clear young voice carried well as he spoke . " He 's quite a boy , " he said , and shook his head . " Damn if I could stop him . But he sure moves around good for an old feller . " " Is he still smoking ? " I asked . " Yeah . And having some coffee , " said June . " I 'll send him back soon 's I can . Want some coffee yourself ? " " I certainly do . " " O.K. , " he said , and departed forward . It was a delight to watch the way he wiggled his way over and around all the many obstructions . Tired by the crouching- position I had had to assume to look out , I went forward to the corrugated-metal deck over the little door and the bomb-bay . I folded my raincoat to lie on , made a pillow of my knapsack , put on my sweater and windbreaker , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and to doze . Whenyou ca n't eat and ca n't smoke , sleep is a good thing . I felt Sansome open the little door , for it jarred the deck . I looked at my watch . It was ten minutes to nine . He put his head near mine and he shouted at me . " Coffee , " he said and pointed forward . I nodded . As soon as he was out of the way , I went along the catwalk and opened the slide . I could see the legs of the two pilots in their seats forward ; the radio sergeant , with earphones , at a tiny desk , his sets before him ; the navigator fiddling with a sextant unlike any I had seen before ; and the corporal . I could n't see where there would be room for me in that tiny space , into the middle of which hung an iron gunner 's seat suspended below the upper gun blister . A large spider of the same canary-yellow as the oxygen tanks had woven himself a most symmetrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now patiently motionless in the bright sunlight . " O.K. ? " I said . The corporal waved me in . I pulled myself up and crawled below the iron seat and to one side and sat on a cardboard carton beside Corporal June . " I could n't get granpa out until he come , " said June , pointing to Floyd , the navigator . He leaned past me and closed the slide down . At once it was quite possible to hear and be heard without shouting . " He 's pretty large . " The sergeant turned round and grinned . So did Floyd . " The navigator 's going to take a shot , " said the corporal . " I 'll give you coffee after that . It 'd blow the hell over every-thing . " Floyd , with his left hand through a strap on the sextant , seized a handle in the roof above him with his right hand and pulled it down ; a hatch hinged open , and the Corporal held its lower edge . Then Floyd , leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot forward , raised his sextant in both hands and applied the eyepiece to his right eye , his left eye closed . As he stood there the wind shook him slightly , and made a furious and elemental uproar in the little cabin . The radio sergeant bowed his head and clutched the papers on his desk . Floyd stood thus a long time sighting the distant sun . His two hands were joined , the fingers extended and touching like those of a man deep in prayer , and his face was marked by an expression of the same intentness . Presently he removed the sextant from his eye , looked at his watch , and together he and June closed the hatch . Then he sat down and wrote figures from his sextant on the back of an envelope , like a small boy doing sums for his home work , his lips moving as he figured . Then he smiled at us and left . He bumped into June , he stepped hard on my feet , he hit his shoulder on the gun seat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With difficulty he opened the slide door and awkwardly descended and closed it after him . Through the glass in the slide I could see his legs disappear as he crawled forward into the navigator 's cabin below us , in the nose of the plane . " Christ ! " said June . " If he ai n't the clumsy ! " " It 's close quarters , " I said . " Listen , " he said . " Even that big jerk with you gets around in here . Not good like you do it , but not bad . We all get around , do n't we ? We do n't hit this , hit that , bump the other . On'y him . " " Yeah , " said the sergeant . " That 's all you judge a guy by . How he crawls around a plane . " Buford stuck his head back toward us and grinned . " June crabbing about Floyd again ? " he said . " Wants him to be a snake dancer , like him , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said June . " Just because you got to creep all over the plane all the time , " said Buford , " and you were born double jointed ' s no reason to pick on poor old Floyd . " He winked at me . " Aah l " said June . " That lunk ! " " Is he good at his job ? " I asked . " Oh , sure , " said June . " He does his job O.K. But for God 's sake , ai n't part of it to get around without he kicks the hell outa himself and everyone else ? Christ , he 's always got bruises on him . " " Just because you have n't any education , " said Buford , " you 're jealous . " " Nuts , " said June . " No more has Dresden . " The co-pilot turned around and joined in . The plane was under the control of " George , " the automatic pilot . " Who says I 'm not educated ? " Dresden said . " Arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act it . " " Sure I am , " said Dresden . " I almost finished high school . And what 's more , I 'm a Christian , which is more'n you are . " " Aah , nuts ! " said , June . " You were n't baptized even , " said Dresden . " Probably he was n't , " said Buford . " I was so , " said June . " And I can vote , which is more than either of you two kids can do . Since last month . " " Baptize him. , " said Dresden . " He 's old enough for it . " Buford reached down and lifted a lily-cup full of water , and he poured it over June 's head . " I christen thee Snake-hips , " he cried and burst into wild laughter . So did the others . It was the sort of laughter I remember from preparatory school . It was equally contagious . June filled a cup from the water container and shot its contents at Dresden ( Buford was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his armor plate ) . Then they all laughed again . I looked out of the window . The Pacific Ocean lay far below and very endless . They were still howling with laughter when the slide door opened and in through it came Sansomc 's head and shoulders . He took it all in , with a half-smile on his face . " Room for me , children ? " he shouted . " Wait till he 's had coffee , " said June . " I 'll stand here , " Sansome said . " No , " said June . " We ca n't smoke with that slide open . Go on back . " " I 'll sit on the floor , " said Sansome ; " there 's plenty of room , " and he grabbed the bar and pulled himself in . For a large man of his years he did it easily and quickly and he sat on the floor , under the gun seat , and crossed his legs like a Hindu . " Plenty of room , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a bit rough , for we were going through patches of high cloud now and again . June said nothing further , but he poured me out some coffee from a thermos , and I drank it gratefully and lit a cigarette . I had about finished smoking when we hit the really rough weather , suddenly . I could not see Buford from where I sat , but I saw his hands go down and shift the control back from " George " to himself and Dresden . It was swiftly and surely done . They had stopped their fooling now and were busy . By the feel in my cars I could tell we were climbing , but it seemed to do no good , and soon we were deep in the clouds and the rain began . I had never known rain like that , even in a Hollywood movie storm . It sounded as though it would break the thin skin of the plane and must surely crack the transparent dome of the blister . The plane bucked and heaved and dropped like a fast elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit another cigarette . He had just about got it going when Buford turned round in his seat and said to me , " You 'd better go aft for a while . " His voice was pleasant and clear , even over the hail-like sound of the rain , but could n't take my eyes off his face . This was n't the child I 'd met nor the child I 'd just seen . This was suddenly a mature face , full grown , and yet with no lines to tell you how the magic had been done . " Right , " I said ; and to Sansome , " you 'll have to go first . " " Let me finish this , please , " said San-some . It was n't a request , it was a state-mcnt . " Please go aft , " said Buford to him , without raising his voice . " In a few minutes , " said Sansome . " Now , " said the Captain . There was a quality in his voice then that was like a whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up as if he 'd been hit  --  he stared at Buford  --  and then he opened the slide and lowered himself through it , and I followed him into the dark of the catwalk . The rough , weather did n't last much more than half an hour . About one o'clock the Corporal came back and brought us coffee and sandwiches , and afterward Sansome went to sleep on a pileof yellow life jackets he had found . As it was calm then , I went forward and was allowed to come up . " George " was flying the plane , the sun shone , and the children were again at play . It was rather pleasant to hear anyone laugh so much . The only break came at three o'clock when we passed over a tiny coral atoll , lovely in the cobalt below us . It made all the vastness of this ocean seem greater to me . To them it was a subject for delighted comment and they kidded June because the navigator had hit on it exactly , and had thus given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . June had to admit that , but you could see that he still did n't like Floyd , because he bumped into things when he moved round . I stood for a while back of Buford and talked to him . He was bored , he said , with this run . " I 've made this same run four times , " he said . " Only change you get is when the Japs bomb one landing field and then you get to see a new island  --  till you know ' em all . " " Where do you want to be ? " I asked . " I put in for the China flight , " he said . " Twenty of us did , but they only took ten . Boy , I 'd certainly like to fly that run , over the high mountains , India to Chungking ! " His voice invested it with the glamour of far places . " If you were on that run , " I said , " do n't you suppose you 'd wish you had the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said . " This is just dull mostly . " I did n't pursue it further . It would have been a pity if he had learned about that already . Shortly after this Sansome came up , and I went back aft . We landed at Thanksgiving Island by evening . That island 's no size at all , and its high . point is four feet above the level of the brilliant viridian water that surrounds it . From the high air it is beautiful , but that is an illusion . It has dreary mangrove swamps and ugly coconut plantations , and coming down to it from the clear , cold , dry air we had enjoyed was like dropping into a boiler room . It was wet underfoot from the constant showers and it was steamy from intermittent blasts of sun . It lies too near the equator for comfort , that island . There was a truck to take us to quarters , but Sansome was put out at that . " I expected a car , " he said to the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Colonel 's gone to the other island , " said the driver . " He wo n't be back till to-morrow , sir . Major Crest 's in charge . " " Damn , " said Sansome . " The Colonel knew I was coming . General Brestford said he 'd let him know . Well . All right . I 'll go in the truck . Can somebody get my bags ? " " Yessir , " said the driver . He climbed out and fetched them from near the plane , and Sansome got in with us . " Thanks , " said Sansome to the driver . " Hell of a place this is , is n't it ? " " You said it , " said the driver . " And I been here close to a year . " He got in his truck then and drove off . None of the rest of us said anything . We were assigned to little huts , each sleeping about ten officers . They were not screened . The canvas cots had thin mattresses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive-green . San-some and Buford and I were assigned to Hut No. 4 . I took a salt-water shower and shaved and I had supper with the rest of the officers from the bombers which had flown in . After supper I went to the Officers ' Club , a tiny little building with a few books and many old magazines . The talk there was pleasant and interesting . At nine o'clock , knowing we were off again early , I left . But I had forgotten to bring my flashlight , it was raining , and there were no lights of any kind , and it took mea half hour of stumbling into puddles and shallow ditches of water before I finally found the hut . I doubt if I could have found it so soon if it had n't been that as I approached it a flashlight went on by the door . It was Sansome , I could tell by the gray of his suit . " Is that Number Four ? " I said softly , for fear of waking someone . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn in ? " " I think I will , " I said . " I 'm going to see the Major , " he said . " Maybe he can get me into something better than this dump . " " Anyone asleep in here ? " I asked . " Yes , " he said , dropping his voice even lower . " One . The baby boy Buford is asleep . " He left , his flashlight turning to the ground and making a pool of moving light that flared suddenly up onto the wide palm leaves as the light struck the puddles of water . I went in and found my cot in the dark . My knapsack was on the cot and I fished out my flashlight . I was quiet . I took off my wet shoes and shirt and trousers and I fixed the mosquito bar and tucked it in , and I was about to crawl in under it when 1 was seized with an impulse to look at Buford . I turned the flash on his cot , briefly , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay stark naked and utterly relaxed on his blanket , his thin wrists delicately bent , his deep lashes over his closed eyes . " The baby boy is asleep , " Sansome had said . " No , " I said to myself . " Sansome is wrong . The Captain is asleep . " And I switched off the light and left him to his dreams of mountains and to the darkness he needed against to-morrow 's wide sea .
