The mercury stood at two below zero one morning last week at Pine Camp , the U.S. Army 's 107,000-acre training area in northern New York . Three feet of snow blanketed the terrain , dotted with scrub pines . At H-hour , 11:30 a.m. , 15 potbellied Fairchild Packets roared overhead , a scant 800 feet over the snow . <P> Then parachutes , white , red , green , blue and yellow , blossomed beneath the planes and the air was filled with men , guns and gear . For the next two days the paratroopers established an " airhead " against a theoretical enemy who had theoretically overrun the northeast . <P> It was the biggest oversnow airborne maneuver in Army history , the climax of " Exercise Snowdrop , " latest in the Army 's continuing research into the best way of fighting an Arctic war ( others : Task Forces Frigid , Frost , Williwaw in Alaska , Wisconsin and the Aleutians ) . The jump was made by 500 men of the 505th Airborne Battalion Combat Team , a unit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the Army was any better set to fight a cold war than it had been before . Movement was slow . Clothing , equipment , chutes and arms made 300-lb. sloths of average-sized men . The heaviest artillery dropped was 75-mm. cannon , and it was set up too slowly by numbed fingers . Firepower would have to be heavier , said the experts , and it would have to be parachuted down in one piece . <P> The exercise had its comic aspects . One load of supplies was dropped wide of its mark . When the local citizenry started to make off with it , the 505th 's commander , Lieut . Colonel Robert Wienecke , hopped into a helicopter and went after them . He hovered ten feet in the air over one man who was dragging a bundle to his car , rose in his seat and trumpeted : " Go put that back . " The " liberator " obeyed . <P> There was nothing comic , however , about the conclusions reached by qualified observers . New York Times Military Analyst Hanson Baldwin found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small-scale operations over snow-covered terrain , large-scale transpolar military expeditions would be " virtually impossible . " Wrote he : " The difficulties of mass airborne operations in subzero weather are so major that they may never be solved . " Mars , like a brass monkey , could not stand intense cold .
