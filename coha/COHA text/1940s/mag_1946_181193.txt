It was only a little battle , but it was a great victory . <P> The countryside between Trenton and Princeton was gentle to the eye , but frozen and cruelly hard to the ill-shod men of Washington 's rabble in arms . The back road by which the Continental General hoped to outflank Lord Cornwallis was full of tree stumps-which made heavy work for the cannoneers wrestling the rag-muffled wheels . Perhaps the General , flushed with his Christmas Night victory at Trenton , was now going too far . <P> Marching out of Princeton came three British regiments of foot , gleaming in scarlet and gold . These were no mercenaries , like the Hessians beaten at Trenton ; these were seasoned and loyal troops . From a striking force of perhaps 2,500 men , Washington detached a skeleton brigade led by General Hugh Mercer to destroy the bridge over Stony Brook . But it was too late . The British regulars shattered and scattered the raw American irregulars , gave Mercer a fatal wound . His panicked men infected Washington 's main body . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington tried to rally his ragged men , now in ragged ranks . Finally , riding a big white horse , the exposed himself between the lines , inviting obedience - or death . For a moment the fate of the Continental Army hung in excruciating suspense . Each side fired a volley . When the smoke from the muskets lifted in the frosty air , Washington still bestrode his horse , unscathed . The Redcoats gave way . The victorious Americans carried their pursuit into Nassau Hall . <P> <P> The little battle established Washington , once dubbed a Fabius Cunctator , as a general of brilliant resource . Said Frederick the Great ( an expert with the rhetorical long bow ) : these " achievements were the most brilliant of any recorded in the annals of military science . " The Revolution went on to its ordained end . <P> Eight score and nine years rolled gently over the gently rolling battlefield of Princeton . By chance , it was little built upon . This week , while the sweet gums turned as scarlet as the British soldiers ' coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Princeton 's President Harold Willis Dodds : the University was " succumbing to nostalgia " in its bicentennial year . On the preserved battlefield , any lover of human liberties could look back with pride . <P> <P> *Artist John Trumbull made it a horse of another color ( sec Cut ) .
