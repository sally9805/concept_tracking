At 8:15 every Friday morning , some ten million Britons tune in BBC for five minutes of painless medicine . The rich , soothing voice that pours out of the radio sounds like a ham actor 's impersonation of a family doctor . Britain 's " Radio Doctor " dispenses no-nonsense counsel that seldom fails to cheer his listeners . <P> The doctor makes a point of not coddling his vast , loyal audience . " Doctor , does it do any good in rheumatism to carry a potato in the pocket ? " asked a listener last week . " A fatheaded question , " replied the amiable doctor . " Now I ask you-do you really think that changes in the joints , deep-seated changes , can be effected by a spud in your jacket pocket ? " <P> Technically ( because of organized medicine 's starchy and persnickety " ethics " ) , the " Radio Doctor " is anonymous ; but many a BBC listener knows by now that he is 43-year-old Dr. Charles Hill , fat , shrewd secretary of the British Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s chief spokesman and propagandist . Primarily a health educator , he had practiced little bedside medicine before he went on the air . But in the last six years he has become one of Britain 's most powerful and popular medicos . <P> The doctor 's health talks are an adroit mixture of sharply worded advice and blunt humor . " Life , " he explains to his ten million listeners , " is a matter of moments that are lost and bowels that are distended . " His descriptions of ailments are calculated to shock hypochondriacs out of their introspective gloom ( " Just think of a boil-as round as a football , as red as a raspberry , as tender as the treacly smile of a lovesick maiden ! " ) . <P> Other Hillisms : <P> " The road to intestinal purgatory is paved with purgatives . . . . The bowel becomes dazed and dull . . . . " <P> " If you take alcohol , do n't pretend you 're doing a virtuous thing , that it 's good food or medicine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Breast milk is the best food , bar none . It 's easier , cheaper than anything else ; no rationing , no milkman to bring it , already pasteurized , served up piping hot , and ready for immediate consumption . " <P> " The only preventive for baldness . . . is to avoid being born to parents with a streak of baldness . It 's probably something to do with the sex glands . Nobody has ever seen a bald eunuch . " <P> " Vaccines are no use . . . they are not worth the trouble . . . . Vitamins do n't prevent colds or cure them . There 's a bit of a racket there . ... If you take no drugs , your cold lasts 14 days ; if you take drugs , it lasts a fortnight . " <P> " Eat something green and raw every day . " <P> " Do n't be like the old lady who , put on a diet , was discovered by her doctor eating a steak- &-kidney; pudding . ' Yes , doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet ; now I 'm ' aving me dinner .
