Franklin Roosevelt discovered last week that being a wartime President did not make him inviolate to attacks when he acted like a politician . <P> " Affront . " To the juicy job of Collector of Internal Revenue in Missouri he named hulking , blue-jowled Robert E. Hannegan , formerly assistant boss of as slick a political machine as St. Louis ever saw , until indignant St. Louis voters turned it out a year ago . St. Louis groaned ; it had trounced the machine for giving it some of the worst circuit judges in history , for conniving in the State Democratic organization 's attempt to steal the Governorship ( TIME , March 23 ) ; it wanted no more of Hannegan &; Co . Snapped the Post-Dispatch : " The President 's action is an affront to thousands of citizens . . . . " <P> " Corrupt . " To a newly created fifth Federal judgeship in New Jersey Mr. Roosevelt appointed 53-year-old Thomas F. Meaney , who stepped into his first judgeship 19 years ago , has been a faithful follower of Frank Hague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic National Committee . Mr. Roosevelt rejected the man whom Governor Charles Edison wanted for the job . <P> Ever since his election to the Governorship in 1940 , Edison has fought Hague - replacing Hague men with anti-Hague Democrats . It looked as if he had Boss Hague on the run . <P> But Edison 's old friend Franklin Roosevelt thought he needed New Jersey 's colorless Senator William Smathers re-elected this November ( the Senator 's only achievement is riding the New Deal coat tail ) and knew he needed Hague 's machine to turn the trick . Edison and his fight to clean up New Jersey politics must wait . Mr. Roosevelt 's Justice Department took a look at Mr. Meaney and promptly pronounced him " superior " to the three other candidates . <P> Said the Newark Evening News , which has supported the President in the war effort : " For all their protestations of good government , Mr. Roosevelt and his Attorney General find it possible in the midst of a great war to do a turn for a corrupt political machine . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he was Boss Hague 's candidate .
