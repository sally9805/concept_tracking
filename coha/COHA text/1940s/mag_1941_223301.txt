" When a material gets as scarce as copper , " SPAB Director Donald Nelson told the Truman Committee last week , " priorities are no longer any good . It has to be straight allocation . . . both from the top and from the bottom . " <P> This was reassuring talk . Allocation , Washington 's new magic word , was about to replace priorities in earnest ( TIME . Oct. 6 ) . Theoretically , this meant that civilian industries starving for lack of scarce materials could expect a fairer shake , that Army and Navy must also submit to allocation , instead of hogging the head of the queue . Said Nelson Deputy Albert J. Browning last week , " Some proportion of critical materials must be set aside for general civilian use . " <P> But this week a large section of the civilian economy discovered that " allocation from the bottom " was no safer than priorities . In a drastic order , the use of copper was virtually forbidden ( after Jan. 1 ) in more than 100 common household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The case of jewelry was a miniature study of the whole U.S. scarcity dilemma . The product is about as far from defense as a product can be . But it assumed symbolic proportions because the jewelers had important friends at court : Republican Leader Joe Martin and House Majority Leader John McCormack . There are only a few hundred jewelry-makers in Martin 's and McCormack 's New England . But there are 100,000 small manufacturers in the U.S. , and their aggregate political importance is even greater than Joe Martin 's . <P> The jewelers arrived in Washington last week the day after Donald Nelson had given the New York Sales Executives Club some jolting facts about copper . For this month latest OPM estimates show 5,730 tons too little copper for defense and Lend-Lease alone . For 1942 they show a maximum supply of 1,650,000 tons ( including a sanguine 600,000 tons of imports ) ; defense and Lend-Lease needs of 1,050,000 tons ; " essential civilian " needs of 250.000 tons . This left 350,000 tons for " other civilian " demand-which OPM estimated at 1,100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Ballou Jr. , head of the New England Manufacturing Jewelers &; Silversmiths Association , was soon closeted with Washington 's most important defensemen ( see cut ) . * To them he described the idleness that faces 35,500 jewelry factory workers in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ( 60,000 in the U.S. ) unless the industry gets a measly 5,688 tons of copper , 1.409 tons of zinc , in 1942 . Without it he saw at least two ghost towns : North Attleboro and Attleboro , Mass. , dead center of the industry in this war as in the last . In 1918 Barney Baruch had not let Attleboro go under . <P> Little Business ' Floyd Odium , breathing sympathy and courage , said he would go to bat for the jewelers . His sympathy was strengthened when canny Joe Martin pointed out that the U.S. is still importing jewelry from British manufacturers , whom war has not yet liquidated . Nevertheless this week the jewelers got the kiss of death from Donald Nelson .               @ @ @ @ @ @
