French devotees of le jazz hot were as distressed as hepcats who have lost their piano player . Since Liberation , they had turned to a squad of American G.I.s for music and entertainment . But Yanks in France had dwindled to fewer than 30,000 ; now the American Forces Network - the best in U.S. radio - was packing its tubes and preparing to pull the plug . To their French fans , it was a crisis of the first order . <P> AFN was formed ( stations in Paris and Le Havre ) to entertain occupation forces , not Frenchmen . But there was nothing to keep Parisians and others from tuning into the recorded programs from America - Bob Hope , Fibber McGee , Fred Allen , etc. , into Beaucoup de Mtisique , an hour-long afternoon jive session , or Midnight in Paris , a two-hour nightly dance program . Unlike dull , politicky French radio , which suspended afternoon broadcasts four days a week to cut costs , AFN had become as staple a fare as red wine . Gaston Deferre , French Under Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network going . <P> The U.S. Information Service , with an eye and an ear to bettering Franco-American relations , added its plea . At week 's end , Brigadier General Paul W. Thompson , chief of the Army 's Information and Education Division , granted a reprieve : AFN 's staff of 28 , which prepares 88 shows a week , would stand by for another fortnight . A way might be found , the General hinted , to keep the popular AFN network going . The French radio audience could still twist the dial to AFN , sit back and have a good time .
