I WAS the only man in the world who saw him do it . Everybody else was hurrying . Everybody else around that hospital was busy , or flat on his back and beyond seeing . I had a smashed ankle and was using a crutch , so I could n't hurry . That was the only reason I was on the grounds and allowed to sit on a bench . If it had n't been for that I would have missed it . I saw what it meant , too . I had the perspective , you see , and the time to think about it . In the end I hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry , but it was a frightening experience , perhaps not so much frightening as weird because I suddenly and preternaturally saw very close to the end ? the end of all of us ? and it happened because of that squirrel . The bird-feeding station stood on the lawn before my bench . Whoever had erected it was a bird-lover , not a squirrel enthusiast , that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thin pipe stuck upright in the ground , and over the end of the pipe half of a bread can had been inverted . The thin , smooth pipe and the ' bread can were to keep squirrels from the little wooden platform and roof where the birds congregated to feed . The feeding platform was attached just above the tin shield that protected it from the squirrels . I could see that considerable thought had gone into the production of this apparatus and that it was carefully placed so that no squirrel could spring across from a nearby tree . In the space of the morning I watched five squirrels lope easily across the lawn and trytheir wits on the puzzle . It was clear that they knew the bread was there ? the problem was to reach it . Five squirrels in succession clawed their way up the thin pipe only to discover they were foiled by the tin umbrella around which they could not pass . Each squirrel in turn slid slowly and protestingly back to earth , flinched at my distant chuckle , and went away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . There was a sixth squirrel that came after a time , but I was bored by then , and only half watching . God knows how many things a man misses by becoming smug and assuming that matters will take their natural course . I almost drowsed enough to miss it , and if I had , I might have gone away from there still believing in the fixity of species , or the inviolability of the human plane of existence . I might even have died believing some crass anthropocentric dogma about the uniqueness of the human brain . As it was , I had just one sleepy eye half open , and it was through that that I saw the end of humanity . It was really a very little episode , and if it had n't been for the squirrel I would n't have seen it at all . The thing was : he stopped to think . He stopped right there at the bottom of the pole and looked up and I knew he was thinking . Then lie went up . H E WENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teetered the loose shield . In practically the next second he had caught the tilted rim of the shield with an outstretched paw , flicked his body on to and over it , and was sitting on the platform where only birds were supposed to be . He dined well there and daintily , and went away in due time in the neat quick fashion by which he had arrived . I clucked at him and he stopped a moment in his leisurely sweep over the grass , holding up one paw and looking at me with the small shrewd glance of the wood people . There are times now when I think it was a momentous meeting and that for just a second in that sunlit glade , the present and the future measured each other , half conscious in some strange way of their destinies . Then he was loping away with the autumn sunlight flickering on his fur , to a tree where I could not follow him . I turned away and limped back to the shadow of my bench . " He 's a smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " He 's a super-smart squirrel , but just the same he 's only a squirrel . Besides , there are monkeys that can solve better problems than that . A nice bit of natural history , an insight into a one-ounce brain at its best , but what 's the significance of --  " It was just then I got it . The chill that had been slowly crawling up my back as I faced that squirrel . You have to remember what I said about perspective . I have been steeped in geological eras : my mind is filled with the osseous debris of a hundred graveyards . Up till now I had dealt with the past . I was one of the planet 's undisputed masters . But that squirrel had busy fingers . He was loping away from me into the future . The chill came with the pictures , and those pictures rose dim and vast , as though evoked from my subconscious memory by that small uplifted paw . They were not pleasant pictures . They had to do with times far off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping amphibian heads on the shores of marshes , with all about them the birdless silence of a land into which no vertebrate life had ever penetrated because it could not leave the water . There was another in which great brainless monsters bellowed in the steaming hollows of a fern forest , while tiny wraith-like mammals eyed them from the underbrush . There was a vast lonely stretch of air , through which occasionally skittered the ill-aimed flight of lizard-like birds . And finally there was a small gibbon-like primate teetering MAGAZINE along through a great open parkland , upright on his two hind feet . Once he turned , and I seemed to see something familiar about him , but he passed into the shade . There were more pictures , but always they seemed to depict great empty corridors , corridors in the sense of a planet 's spaces , first empty and then filled with life . Always along those corridors as they filled , were eager watchers , watching from the leaves , watching from the grasses , watching from the woods ' edge . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes they emerged and strange changes overtook the corridor . It was somewhere there at the last on the edge of a dying city that I thought I recognized my squirrel . He was farther out of the woods now , bolder , and a bit more insolent , but he was still a squirrel . The city was dying , that was plain , but the cause was undiscernible . I saw with a slight shock that nothing seemed very important about it . It was dying slowly , in the length of centuries , and all about it the little eyes under the leaves were closing in . It was then that I understood , finally , and no longer felt particularly glad or sorry . The city was forfeit to those little shining brains at the woods ' edge . I knew how long they had waited . And we , too , had been at the woods ' edge in our time . We could afford to go now . Our vast intellectual corridor might stretch empty for a million years . It did not matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , then the wood rats . They were all there waiting under the leaves . II I SUPPOSE everyone keeps by his night light some collection of tales by which he may frighten himself back to sleep in moments of insomnia . I know that I do . And if you are like me , you have , on occasional midnights , disputed lordship of the planet with intellectual octopi , or seen mankind pushed horribly aside by giant termites . These notions may be sinister at midnight , but the truths of daylight are simpler and more terrible : mankind may perish without assistance from any of these . The human brain was a beautiful and terrible invention . It is unique . And because it is unique there are many who believe that its achievements will never be possible of duplication in nature , that , in the words of one naturalist , " progress hangs on but a single thread . That thread is the human germ plasm . " A French scholar murmurs a little uneasily " man alone in the universe is not finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an impassioned vigor . " Among the actual inhabitants of the earth , " he says , " past and present , no other lines could have been taken which would have produced speech and conceptual thought . . . It could not have been evolved on earth except in man . " That remark is both wise , in a sense , and foolish . It is the statement of a man who has looked far into the depths of the past and seen nothing so wonderful as man . Yet it betrays also the reluctance of the human imagination as it turns toward the future ? its concern with itself , its unwillingness to relinquish the stage . This genuinely profound mind is surely not unaware that an intellectual dinosaur of the dying Cretaceous might well have murmured : " The saurians alone are not finished . What possible things could improve upon us ? " The Cretaceous date line would have made it a wise and Huxlian statement . It would have taken ten million years to force its serious alteration . Mr. Huxley is equally safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuously at the potential threat offered by our rowdy remaining cousins up in the family tree . " The monkeys , " he says , " have quite left behind them that more generalized stage from which a conscious thinking creature could develop . " I am afraid that we are altogether too impressed by the fact that we live on the ground and that our remaining relatives , poor fellows , show a decided preference for trees . It never seems to occur to us that if they did n't stay up there we would jolly well show them what for . As for that " more generalized stage " which Mr. Huxley demands for the appearance of a thinking creature , I am quite sure that he can not define it in a way which would seriously threaten the reputation of several existing primates . The only way to become a " generalized stage " is to produce , in the course of time , several divergent smart descendants . No one can say that that faculty has been lost , but the whole monkey group will stay upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down , there is still my squirrel , whose actions at times remind me of a certain ancient human forerunner in the Eocene . That chap was n't recognized as " generalized " either , until somewhere along the way he began to walk on his hind feet . In the beginning , I 'm not at all sure he was as smart as my squirrel . Now I have said that Mr. Huxley is safe from refutation , geological time being what it is . If it is impossible to refute him until the passage of another sixty million years , it might be more comfortable to assume he has spoken the truth . It might have been , that is , up until last year . It was then that scientists began to scratch actively in the African bone lands . It was then that archeologists began to whisper behind their hands and exchange glances . It concerned , of course , a certain skull . That in itself was bad enough , but what ensued was worse . E WAS an ape , they had said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporal expansions which appear to be concomitant with and necessary to articulate man is no true man . " Then there had come that frightening insistence on the part of his discoverer that he had used fire and tools . The little fellow was promptly redescribed . His type was cited in glowing terms as " intelligent , energetic , erect , and delicately proportioned little people . " He was credited with speech , and spoken of respectfully as a potential human ancestor . It was more comfortable that way . Otherwise you were confronted with a spectacle like Dunsany 's mysterious Abu Laheeb , that strange being squatting over its lonely fire in the marshes ? the only beast in the world that made fire like man . The mythical Abu Laheeb survived by hiding in the papyrus swamps of the upper Nile . Australopithecu.s prometheus , the ape who made fire , was not that fortunate . He disappeared . The reason why concerns Mr. Huxley 's philosophy and is in some sense a refutation of it . Men say , in the books , that man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chance , that is , for brain . In the past , however , when man was yet weak , a cousin tried to take the path he walked upon and almost succeeded . A cousin from the despised roof tree , where the eyes still watch us overhead . To explain his failure and near success , we must go back millions of years . To explain what will come after our own extinction , we must again read backward ? not for biological events which can never be repeated in exactitude , not for signs of the reappearance of forms which have had their day and will never again emerge into the light ? but rather to project forward into the future those dread principles which have controlled the movement of life on this planet through untold eons of time , and which will continue to direct its destiny through the untold eons of the future . The destructiveness of man has lent a sparse and impoverished aspect to the animal life of the present day . It implies senescence and decline . Both are illusory . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human disappearance . III T HERE are two sorts of evolutionary movement in the world of life , and one is more mysterious than the other . There are , for example , the slight differences which arise between species , the multiplicity of closely related shrubs , grasses , trees , and animals which can be observed over an acre of ground . All of these forms , plant and animal alike , may be occupying essentially the same environment or small , slightly diver-o- " micro-environments " within that acre . The diversity is pleasing . It leads us to comment on the infinite richness of life . Much of this burgeoning splendor is , nevertheless , without meaning so far as the grander progression of life is concerned . Some of it is the product of genetic drift which may have little importance even in terms of natural selection . It is diversity without significance , save as it represents the infinite capacities of the cell . The real mystery , by contrast , lies on a mightier stage . It is the great symphonic movement through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who crawled ashore on his fins , the amphibian who painfully learned to walk . It is the reptile who invented the egg and thus released land vertebrates from dependence on the water . It is the saurian who flew , and who also learned to control his body MAGAZINE temperature until he became a high-speed efficient mammalian machine whose brain did not grow torpid in the chilling night . It includes , also , a creature who came down from the trees and took his first tentative step down the long grassland corridor that was to lead him out into the magnificient vistas of conceptual thought . The advance into those various worlds , into the air and the light out of the depths of the waters consumed millions of years of effort . It was not all an upward movement . Species by thousands died ; species went into the ground ; species went back to the waters ; species clung to the high trees and shrieked clown at their human brothers . The smaller movements we understand well ? the horse from five toes to one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead it is the plunge through the forbidden zones that catches the heart with its sheer audacity. in the history of life there have been few such episodes . It is that which makes us lonely . We have entered a new corridor , the cultural corridor . There has been nothing here before us . In it we are utterly alone . In it we are appallingly unique . We look at each other and say , " It can never be done again . " It is almost as though in our very bones were felt ancestral memories of the way we have come , and the feeling like magic touches us once more so that we repeat with something like terror in our voices , " It can never be done again . " Now it is one of the strange paradoxes of biology that this feeling of mystery concerning the great biological inventions which have opened the doorways of life has deepened as our knowledge has increased . Long evolutionary lines in a given environmental zone have been worked out , transition forms have been noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another have been observed . In the beginning , Darwin and his followers assumed confidently that the major gaps which yawned between the phyla ? the space , say , between the fish and the amphibian , between the reptile and the bird ? would eventually be found to contain transition forms extending in the same imperceptible way from the one form to the other , even though a major life threshold had been crossed . The lack of such transitional forms was not at first disturbing . Success in the pursuit of ancestral lines over long time-intervals led to the conclusion that these major gaps were due solely to imperfections in the geological record ; that the book . of Nature had , so to speak , missing pages , but that the main outlines of the story could easily be read from the pages that remained . It was not until much later that those missing pages were ' observed to occur with almost monotonous regularity at some dramatic transition point , involving the emergence of a new form of life and its adaptation to either an unentered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some new way . The new type , in other words , seemed to emerge with astounding quickness , considering the generally slow evolutionary pace to be read from many of the remains which the fossil hunters were discovering in the better known strata of the earth . T ins situation has led to much specula- tion . It has led on the part of some to a denial of the reality of evolution , on the part of others to claims for some type of " jumping evolution " in which fantastically complex mutations brought new organic forms into existence at a single step . The confusion created by this situation is perhaps nowhere better expressed than in Lecomte de Nouy 's recent book , The Road to Reason . He says : " The general fact that paleontology only shows us a few transitional forms and still fewer really primitive forms , is also very disturbing . . . . We do not grasp the origin of any group . " It happens , however , that these widely expressed doubts are often tinged unconsciously with emotionalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are by no means non-existent . They are merely scarce . We have in growing numbers the mammal-like reptiles standing between the reptiles and the mammals . We have a strange , rare creature , Archaeopteryx . lying between the reptiles and the birds . There are other gaps which remain unclosed . These signs are , nevertheless , suggestive . More fossils will be found . Those which we possess , inadequate though they are , do not support the notion of fantastic leaps in nature . They suggest , instead , that the march across a major barrier into a new sphere of existenceis made rapidly if it is made successfully at all . A basic organic change of this nature is estimated by the brilliant modern student , G. G. Simpson , to have proceeded at a pace , in some instances , ten or fifteen times more rapid than the later recorded evolution of a given group after it has begun to exploit its new domain . The comparatively hasty crossing , hasty in a geological sense , was made by small groups of animals undergoing extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be numerous fossils . Archaeopteryx , the bird-reptile , for example , was found in 1861 . It still remains a solitary specimen . Another fact can be noted as we study these records . It is in a sense obvious , yet it has been neglected by many writers obsessed with human uniqueness or with the superiority of the mammalian line in general . It can be laid down almost as a truism . No successful crossing into a new corridor of life can be effected if that corridor is completely dominated by prior intruders . This statement must be made somewhat dogmatically . Apparent exceptions can be observed , but they constitute special cases which do not affect the general principle . It could be noted , for example , that the reptiles made two separate attempts to conquer the air corridor , once by the use of membraneous wings ? the giant glider Pteranodon being a popularly known example ? and secondly by the evolution of true wings and feathers . Both attempts were successful for a long period , and both must have competed for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds . Two facts explain this rather unusual situation . Both forms apparently got across into the airways at approximately the same time , so that neither one had radiated and adapted sufficiently to exclude the other . In addition , the development of flowering plants with accompanying nutritious seeds in the Cretaceous period profoundly stimulated insect evolution . The nutritive possibilities in the air corridor thus increased , but increased in a direction which favored the smaller , speedier , and more effective mechanism , namely , the birds . From the Cretaceous to the present the birds have dominated the airways , and the smaller environmental niches within the airways so effectively that no other vertebrate has successfully challenged their control . One other animal , it is true , has evolved true flight in the interim , but its position only reveals the reality of our truism . The bats , true mammals , came late to the scene . They made the crossing , but made it surreptitiously in the evening twilight . The vast majority of birds are diurnal . The bats cling to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find there . Their numbers , in comparison with birds , are scant . Both figuratively and literally , they arc creatures of the twilight , dwellers at the unwanted margin . That is why they survive . What the bats might have been capable of under other circumstances , it is , of course , impossible to conjecture , but the tremendous energies , the unknown capacities which may be held in check while a new form of life surges endlessly against an already closed corridor , is nowhere better illustrated than in the story of the rise of the mammalian world itself . Our interpretation of that rise is apt to he distinctly colored . We think of dinosaurs as great brainless beasts which failed in the struggle for life , and we think of the mammals , our own ancestral line , as a highly effective group which crowded the reptiles aside . Nothing , in actuality , could be further from the truth . I REMARKED on an earlier page that the truths of daylight are often the most terrible , and that the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some more intellectual or fantastic form of life . That statement was deliberate . The reptiles are a prime example . For 140 million years , during that period known as the Mesozoic , they were the undisputed masters of this planet . In enormous numbers they radiated into every possible geographic niche . They swam and they flew and they walked . Brainless or not , they survived a period of time far more extended than the life of man , far more extended than the whole Age of Mammals . Now what is not very generally understood by the lay public is the fact that throughout the greater portion of this 140 million years the mammalian world was in existence . It was in existence , but it was highly inconspicuous . It was small ; it hid under bushes ; it concealed itself in trees . It had no giant representativessuch as it developed later on after the disappearance of the reptiles . Like the bats on the edge of the bird world , it was existing on tolerance . It was marginal . To have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most formidable carnivores the world has even seen ? perfected killing machines with teeth like bear traps . For a hundred million years those little mammals waited . No one would have dreamed that they , in their turn , might create monsters , and no one , above all , would have imagined that the gray and infinitely complex convolutions of the human brain were locked away in the forebrain of an insectivorous creature no larger than a rat . An observer waiting for some sign of creative emergence among those little animals in the underbrush would have grown weary as years by the million flowed away . He would have sworn that every variation in the game of life had been exploited and played out ? that the reptiles were the master form ? that the mammals were effective only upon an infinitely small size level . Yet in the end , that strange end that closed the day of the Ruling Reptiles , the armored giants vanished . They vanished from the seas and the fern forests ; their great gliding wings disappeared from the coastal air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threatened them . The mammals were insignificant , envious eyes in the reeds ? that was all . We in this remote age may murmur about climatic change or any one of a dozen vague possibilities . Sometimes we consider the notion that species may run through a lifetime , grow old and die , as does an individual organism . We do not know . But this we are unpleasantly aware of : the armored ones went in daylight . Nothing , not even their successors , thrust them aside . It would be millions of years before the shovel heads of the mammalian titanotheres grazed in the valleys that knew the thunder lizard , Triceratops . The mammals did not destroy the great reptiles ; they simply occupied , long after , an empty throne . It was only then that the long suppression of creative energy burst forth in a second marvelous efflorescence , the radiation that created the mammalian world . The story , however , has a moral that is little read : man also is the master of a corridor ; there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mammals and left only the little eyes under the rosebush in the garden . He is safe now to write books about his unique qualities ? and he is unique , as unique as the dinosaurs . He will not be menaced from the field 's edge , but the eyes are still waiting . Once they waited a hundred million years . They can do so again . This time it will be a new corridor ? the cultural corridor ? that they enter , but it will not be as unique as it seems to us , writing as we do that we are the " sole representative of life in its progressive aspect and its sole trustee for any progress in the future . " Once , long ago in Africa , that cousin of whom I spoke made tools and , some think , may have experimented with the forbidden magic of fire itself . Small and timid and slight of brain , he fades back into the silences of pre-history . He made the crossing at the wrong moment , but he proved we arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made again , perhaps even from above , out of the old roof tree , where everyone sits with his tail curled safely out of reach . It is the safety of trees or the safety of being men now . The line is sharp ; there is no halfway mark as there was when the first ill-adjusted migrants stumbled into an empty world . There is no longer any room for an ape who lights fires and is not a man . IV A Lmos-r everything about this animal , up until recently , has been controversial except the fact that it existed . It has been called an ape . It has been called a man . It has been said to have walked upright . It has been said that this is untrue . It has been claimed that it spoke . It is said not to have spoken . More complete specimens have lately begun to fall into the hands of the bone hunters , so that some of the questions which tormented earlier workers have been answered . Others , however , have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of small , upright-walking anthropoids who haunted the grasslands of the Vaal River area from five hundred thousand to a million years ago . They are not all alike in detail , but the whole stock is characterized by teeth of a quite human character . The great shearing canines of the existing apes are reduced to human proportions . These animals must have been omnivorous grassland wanderers , pursuing , small animals , eating wild seeds , and probably robbing an occasional bird 's nest . Around four feet in height , with a brain ranging at 450 to 650 cubic centitneters , their intellectual capacities , though low by human standards , were undoubtedly superior to that of any existing gorilla or chimpanzee . They are the only grassland bipedal ape , as contrasted with primitive grassland man , of which we have any knowledge . As I pointed out earlier , they have been called apes . More lately there has been a tendency to call them men . Awkwardly enough , however , such datings as we have been able to compute for them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct ancestors of true men . Some , at least , of the man-apes were the contemporaries , for a brief while , of primitive men . I suppose that , if the truth were known , one reason why man is so impressed with his own uniqueness is the fact he is alone today in the grassland corridor . In a few remote parts of Africa , a scant number of lower monkeys venture into waste spaces on the ground . The baboon is one.of them . His experiment has turned in another direction . His face is doglike . He runs upon all fours . Of that series of arboreal experimenters who ventured into the first grasslands of the planet during the Miocene epoch and who teetered diffidently from one tree clump to another , upright on their two hind feet , man alone remains . The grasslands were too open , competition too fierce as the sub ? men multiplied , for the long continued survival of unlike forms . We of today see a yawning gulf between ourselves and the old forms in the trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is filled and the rifle would eliminate any wavering half-soul from the forest twilight who was so rash as to venture among us . It is too late for the crossing , too late until man has gone . I SUPPOSE it is the illusion of uniqueness which for so long caused the student of human evolution to take a scattered series of human fossils and try to arrange them in a single line of ascent leading to modern man . It is still being tried with the new man-apes , but there are two embarrassments : their relative recency , and the diversity of their species . It is simply not possible that they are all on the main line of ascent to ourselves . That the Australopithecines have vanished while many simple arboreal relatives of ours survive is not surprising . The man-apes tried to occupy the same environmental niche as man , and as a consequence man destroyed them . This does not mean that the Australopithecines are totally unrelated to ourselves . It does mean , however , that the old notion involving one human ancestral form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the trees and learning to walk upright ? thus starting a simple and direct evolutionary movement which culminated in man of today ? is a fantastic simplification of events . Twenty million years ago the grass lands of the world were spreading . The long cooling that was to produce the Ice Age of later times had just begun . The low continents of the age of reptiles were giving way to mountain growths that swung the ancient jungles of the earlier lands far skyward , and brought drought to the inner continental basins . The grasslands spread farther and farther . Over vast areas the jungle disappeared or shrank to parkland . We know that among the mammals of this period , many diverse orders turned to a grazing existence . Changes in their teeth tell us as much , for the high silica content of grass forces the development of a specialized grazing dentition which will resist wear . Man , of course , is not a grazer , nor were his forerunners up in the diminishing branches . That grassland world was , nevertheless , attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there in the park/ands , anthropoid apes of forms little known ventured on to the ground . A little like the archaic living gibbon , they may have scurried on their hind feet between isolated clumps of trees , snatching insects and seeds before swinging safely into the branches again . The slow changes that some of these animals were undergoing in habits and foot structure may have taken millions of years . There must have been many of these apes on the edge of the grasslands . We need not be surprised if more than one type , over thevast Old World land mass , successfully made that crossing . The corridor was open to aggressive , lively anthropoids who were willing to hunt small animals and insects , and whose diet was unspecialized . The climate was more healthful than that of the parasite-infested jungles . A strange competition began . It was the competition of an odd lot of animals , the apes of the grassland , uncertainly erect , but with the neurological preference for that posture already developed among the branches of the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore it was the competition of groups . Out of that struggle for food , for mates , and for life , the best adapted , the most clever brained , the most successfully communicative would survive . I say communicative because somewhere here on the grasslands in an environment infinitely more demanding and dangerous than the safe retreat of the trees , the already extensive but instinctive call range of the old tree world began to be abandoned for conceptual thought and speech . Under mysterious endocrine influences about which we know nothing , man 's infancy was becoming prolonged , his brain a plastic thing upon which incipient society was beginning to mark the folkways of the group . The strangest ? corridor in the history of life on this planet was being entered ? the cultural corridor . Its final possessors would be masters of the earth . They would write books . They would describe themselves as unique . They were not . THE first of those peculiar human-footed apes to which we have previously referred , was announced to an incredulous world by Professor Raymond Dart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them and to learn something of their habits . Because it was not believed , at first , that they spoke or made tools , Dart , in spite of his conviction that they were closely associated with the earlier history of the human line , referred to them as " no true men . " This year , at Makapansgat in the Central Transvaal of South Africa , Dart reported Australopithecus Prometheus , the fire-maker . Reporters , of course , went wild . Scientists scratched their heads and looked dubiously at one another . The new fossil was reported from deposits showing evidence of the use of fire in the shape of charred bone and traces of charcoal . Though no stone weapons were discovered , there were suspicious indications that Prometheus had used the long bones of slain animals as clubs . A series of neatly fractured baboon skulls from which the brain had probably been extracted for food supplied the evidence . A very simple tool-using capacity on the part of an animal with a 650 cubic centimeter brain capacity is acceptable . That these creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture history . The suspicion continues to be entertained in some quarters , and will continue until further reports are available , that perhaps advanced forms of men may be responsible for the fires and the broken cranial case of Prometheus himself . It is known , at least , that there are somewhat later humanly occupied caves at Makapan . It must not be forgotten , however , that it was Dr. Dart who recognized , over twenty years ago , the importance of the first ItAustralopithecine cranium ; it was conservative science that smiled and later had to eat its words . Whether or not the human-footed apes were fire-users , we know that the animal remains with which they are associated at Makapan place them well within Early Ice Age times . Human relatives they are , but in the narrow sense , at least , they are not men . Men , lowbrowed , perhaps , but true men , were already in existence . The man-apes , by contrast , are a part of that ancient bipedal horde which millions of years ago came out upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they clung to the fringe of the corridor , ran before its terrors , and shared with us that dark and ancient blood from the times before man . Perhaps at the last , late , much too late , they lit the fires that might have made them man ; perhaps even ? and that in itself is a weird thought , since no animal alive has done it ? they watched trembling behind a bush and learned from men the secret of the fire . Perhaps already in some dim , half-human way they sensed their world was fading . Theirs were the last furred hands and theirs the last half-animal voices to be seen and heard in the cultural corridor before the pathway backward closed forever . When it opens again we shall be gone . Sometimes at night I think one can feel even the pressure of mice waiting in the walls of old houses . All that concentrated life around us and above us , held in check , surging impatiently , ready for a new experiment , tired of us , waiting our passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes one catches oneself wondering what the fire-apes were intending when they crossed the barrier , whether they were cut short in a new experiment , something smaller , more delicate , more ? something , but not a human something . Something for which human beings must first be gotten out of the way . It is perhaps significant that even we ourselves feel a growing inadequacy . Perhaps that is really the secret . Perhaps we are going away .
