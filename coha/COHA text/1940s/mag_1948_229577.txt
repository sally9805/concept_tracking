Highways to everywhere , dental work for everybody , pensions for the old folks and bonuses for veterans-all this and more Earl Long promised the citizens of Louisiana if they would elect him governor . " Welcome " would be written over the capital door . " The governor gets his house free , and his groceries and everything free , " Earl proclaimed , " and I want you all to come up to the mansion and have a cup of coffee . You might as well , because you 'll be paying for it anyhow . " <P> The late Huey 's brother sounded almost as good as the Kingfish himself . What was more , Huey 's 29-year-old son Russell was stumping the state for Uncle Earl , and Russell looked just like the Kingfish , right down to his curly hair , pudgy nose and slack chin . It was like old times . <P> Last week Louisiana went to the polls and cast a record primary vote which gave Earl Long a better than 100,000 margin over his nearest rival , " Sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prosaic platform of " good government . " <P> Full-Grown Shoot . A factor in Earl Long 's primary victory was the strength of Judge Robert Kennon , who was all but counted out in the early betting . He ran on an all-G.I. ticket and corralled 125,606 votes , many of which might have gone to Jones . Fourth in the primary was tough-talking Congressman Jimmy Morrison , another old aerial root off Louisiana 's once-flourishing political banyan tree . <P> Earl himself was not so much a root as a full-grown shoot . He had split away from Huey in 1931 , calling his brother " a big-bellied coward . " Earl was a gravel-voiced , bitin ' , scratchin ' man . He once nearly bit an antagonist 's finger off . On another occasion , he sank his teeth so deep in the neck of a state representative that the legislator took a shot of lockjaw serum . <P> Earl got himself elected lieutenant governor in 1936 . When Governor Richard Leche was forced to resign in the heat of one of Louisiana 's many scandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran again but was not reelected . <P> " A Sin &; a Shame . " That fact gave some hope to Sam Jones this week as he squared off with Earl for the runoff election on Feb. 24 . Earl Long had started out by beating Sam Jones in the primaries in 1940 , but Jones had nipped him in the runoff . Jones ' followers , who included " clean government " men like New Orleans ' Mayor deLesseps ( " Chep " ) Morrison , pulled themselves together for " a fight that has got to be made . " <P> But this time Earl was sure he had it in the bag . He even demanded that Jones withdraw . " It 's a sin and a shame , " he croaked , " to waste $600,000 of old-age pension money on a second primary . . . . The people have spoken . Jones will never win this time . "
