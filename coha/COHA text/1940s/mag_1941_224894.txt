Last week Leon Henderson found that his price domain ends at the water 's edge . He tried to monkey with the price of coffee , and ran into the Department of State , which is in the coffee business itself . <P> Defying laws of supply &; demand , coffee has been moving up on all fronts at once : stocks , imports and price ( see chart ) . So Leon Henderson called to his deskside the men who live by coffee . He knew that a number of leading operators had been wisely stocking up , while small fry , caught short , bid up the price . He proposed a Government inventory of all coffee , and even asked the big fellows to release stocks and correct the maldistribution . The meeting was unwieldy , and broke up with little done . Henderson 's next step would normally be to fix all coffee prices by fiat . That might be good business , but not as the State Department understands it . <P> The State Department is a party to the Inter-American Coffee Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee republics last fall . The State Department in fact represents the only major coffee customer these republics have left . The original quota for U.S. consumption was set at 15.9 million bags , 2 million more than the U.S. had ever drunk in a year . The U.S. had 1.5 million bags on hand when the agreement started , and has since upped the quota by another 260,000 bags . But the inventory plight of the small U.S. buyers was Latin America 's opportunity . <P> In Brazil , which gets 58.49% of the U.S. quota , surplus coffee is still being systematically burned ( 54,000 bags last month ) . Yet Brazil 's standard grade , Santos No. 4 , has nearly doubled in price since last August . Colombia ( 19.8% of the quota ) , producing valuable special grades , raised its minimum prices nine times last winter . Brazilian growers and speculators , with 2,300,000 bags of quota coffee still to ship , are holding it back , waiting for still higher prices . Meanwhile shipping space is getting scarce and ocean freight costs are mounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffee price ( 11 ) below which it will not sell . <P> If Leon Henderson were to answer these Latin floors with a U.S. ceiling , Brazilians would yell . It would have a bad effect on the milreis-likewise on the good-neighborly State Department . But if shipping space gets scarcer , the price of coffee may get too high even for State . In that case some sort of import control would be necessary . <P> The case of coffee was merely last week 's example of the conflict in policy among the Government 's various arms . Many another import commodity-copper , rubber , tin . tungsten-has felt the conflict too . New Dealers figured there was only one ultimate solution : a Government import monopoly , next step toward total economic war .
