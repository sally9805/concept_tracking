txt Although it has felt little impact as a result of the war , and has received few war orders , the chemical industry has had a moderate increase in business in the last two weeks . While profits of the companies vary according to their individual positions in the different chemical markets , indications at the moment are that several of the leaders will be able to show second quarter earnings close to the excellent first quarter . Dow Chemical Co. which reported $5 11 a share earned in the nine months ended February 29 , will show well over $6 a share for its fiscal year ending May 31 and may well show around $7 a share This would compare with $3.76 a share earned on the total outstanding shares at the end of the 1939 fiscal year . Higher rate of earnings is due to the general gains in Dow 's business , and the high rate of operations during the year which lowered plant costs . Magnesium Plant Dow 's new Gulf Coast magnesium plant which will make the lightest metal in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will give Dow a total annual capacity of about 25.000,000 pounds of magnesium . Hercules Powder Co. during April ran at about the same rate as in the first quarter and indications are that profits for the June quarter will be close to the $1.22 a share reported for the March period . Air Reduction Co. has had a pickup in demand for oxygen from the steel industry in recent weeks and Westvaco Chlorine Products has also noted an encouraging upturn in its business Affected by War The only important chemical that has been greatly affected by the war is toluol made from coal tar and used in making the high explosive T N T ( tri-nitro-toluol i , This is produced by such coal tar processors as Allied Chemical &; Dye , by the steel companies and by some of the large utility companies . The price of toluol has doubled to around 50 cents a gallon for export since the war started but since most producers are already under contract to domestic consumers , they have not been able to take advantage of the higher price It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on by consumers who have bought the toluol for use as a solvent in lacquers . However the chemical business generally has not been sharing in this So farl &the; chemical industry generally has been so occupied with its domestic business , still running close to peak levels , that it has bad no interest in going after war orders . Also it is unlikely that the belligerents would place very substantial orders for explosives and explosive ingredients unless it becomes apparent that the war will be greatly prolonged . All of the bel-ligerents have laid in large supplies of munitions , and so far the consumption of explosives has apparently not been as large as in the last war . Shell Tubing Orders Some orders for shell tubing have been ' placed with some of the large steel companies but virtually no actual orders for munitions can be located in the chemical industry with the exception of a small production of shells or bombs by Atlas Powder Co . The American chemical industry has been on a peace footing for so long that production of munitions would seriously disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various kinds could be turned out if needed by our own government but this would at the moment be at the expense of regular business . Orders from the Allies on any scale would mean the construction of new plants which presumably would have to be financed largely by the purchaser since American producers are not anxious to build plant capacity which might be useless after the end of the war . Export business to neutrals particularly in South America has been substantial since the start of the war , replacing materials formerly bought in Germany , Great Britain and France .
