DEAR JACK : It 's just as well the morning , paper has n't been slung into your foxhole these past few weeks , because our duly elected representatives in Congress -- I 'm tempted to say unduly elected in some cases  --  have been expressing themselves on the question of giving you a chance to vote next year . And a good deal of the discussion , if you can call it that , is not the kind of free speech you 'd be particularly interested in dying for . From where I 'm sitting , it does seem that if Congress really wanted " our boys , " as they call you so fondly , to have a say in choosing a President in the crucial year of 1944 , it could be arranged . From where you 're sitting , it must look even more plausible . Some of the ordinary-and essentially minor rules about absentee voting would have to be suspended . But after all there 's a war on , and several other rules have been suspended for the duration . All this and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters of a bill that would have simplified the process sufficiently to allow you to cast a vote without taking too much time out from your war , work . But in the end the Senate passed a substitute measure which leaves the matter in the hands of the state governments . If you voted , or tried to vote , last year , you know what that means . Only eight state legislatures will meet in time to simplify absentee voting regulations . In only fifteen states are more than thirty days allowed for obtaining and casting absentee ballots ; and all kinds of complex requirements  --  notices of intent , affidavits , applications , etc.  - -  must be complied with . As a soldier wrote to the New York Times , " Anyone who like myself tried to vote in the 1942 election while in the army knows that it would take a very hardy soldier indeed to bother his commanding officer with all the problems of casting one simple vote . In most cases at least four interviews would be necessary " ( my italics ) . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've already indicated the basic reason that motivated the opposition , which was made up of Southern Democrats and some Northern Republicans . It 's very simple . They hate Roosevelt , and they 're afraid he 'll pick the Democratic candidate next year if he does n't run himself . They know that the vote of some 9,000,000 of " our boys " ? that means you  --  might decide the election , and they are afraid you might cast your votes for Roost , -  --  velt or his candidate . Of course the people who tried to get the vote for you were not unaware of your potential power either , but that does n't make the behavior of the opposition any more savory . The most violent and  --  shall we say ? ? picturesqueorators for the opposition were Senator E. D. Smith of South ma and Representative John E. Rankin of Missistippi . Both come from poll-tax states where you have to pay to vote . As PM pointed out , Rankin owes his political career to the high art of keeping the vote low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 7,079 votes were cast for him , though the population of his district is given as 263,367 . No wonder he believes in the state 's right to keep the vote to a manageable size . Naturally the people who put through the substitute measure do n't admit that they do n't want you to vote . The very suggestion not only outrages them ; it moves them to tears that a crocodile would envy . They rest their case  --  on the Constitution ! Listen , for instance , to " Cotton Ed " Smith . " Mr. President , " he said , " I have one platform on which I shall live and die  --  my loyalty to the Constitution , my loyalty to states ' rights , and my loyalty to white supremacy . " He apparently never heard of the Fifteenth Amendment , which contains that little phrase about " race , color , or previous condition of servitude . " Then he went on to tell a filthy joke about Negroes  --  on the floor of the United States Senate . The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be voted on there until after the Christmas recess . Let 's hope all your friends and relatives at home snake such a fuss in the meantime that our duly elected representatives wo n't dare disfranchise you for the duration  --  and blame it on the Constitution . I 'm designing a special New Year 's card to send to Representative Rankin and Senator Smith . It 's printed on asbestos . M. M. Crocodile Tears ITERALLY , " Assistant Secretary of State Breckinridge Long told the House Foreign Affairs Committee the other day , " the reports of the consular officers to the Department of State form one of the most thrilling and one of the most saddening and awful pages of our humanitarian history . " We agree with Mr. Long , though in a sense other than he intended . " We have taken into this country since the beginning of the Hitler regime and the persecution of the Jews , until today , " he said , " approximately 580,000 refugees . " These figues were intended to impress the committee with the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the decade 1923-33 more than two million immigrants entered this country . The number given by Mr. Long for the Hitler decade is 75 per cent lower than for the pre-Hitler decade . It is false to describe these 580,000 , as he did , as " refugees . " For the nine-year period 1933 to 1942 , of 453,205 immigrants admitted to the United States , only 291,112 came from Europe . The rest were from non-European countries , with Mexico and Canada heading the list . Of the European immigrants , 243,420 came from countries now dominated by Hitler , and of all* the immigrants during this period , 163,423 were Jews . " We did every legitimate thing we could do , " Mr. Long declared . The best answer is the figures on immigration from the Reich itself since Hitler came to power . The annual German quota was 25,957 . From the beginning of 1933 to the end of 1942 we admitted 123,573 immigrants from the Reich , less than half quota allotments . Here are the figures by years : 1933 , 1,324 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,073 ; 1937 , 11,127 ; 1938 , 17,868 . In 1938 came the Anschluss , which added the Austrian quota of 1,413 to the German quota of 25,957 : It was not until 1939 that we eased up on restrictions which had kept German immigration below quota since Hitler came to power . In 1939 we admitted 32,759 immigrants from Germany and Austria . Since then admissions have been below the combined quota ( 27,370 ) . In 1940 admissions of German nationals were 26,083 ; in 1941 they were 15,051 ; in 1942 they were 4,883 . The number admitted fell after the war began on the basis of a new excuse : Gestapo agents were invading the country behind rabbinical beards . The door , as Mr. Long said , " is open " but " carefully screened . " Considering the thousands of applications , it should have been possible , if the department had been really generous , to do that " screening " and still admit the full quota each year . Mr. Long made much of the fact that visitors ' visas were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that this was largely to help Jewish refugees . In the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1942 , the number entering on visitors ' visas was 82,457 ( 2,292 of them Jews ) , the number departing 67,189 ( 1,250 of them Jews ) . Net : 15,268 on visitors ' visas , 1,042 Jews . Most of the visitors were just visitors . In the last half of last year the net remaining on visitors ' visas was 8,688 , of which 134 were Jews . We do not believe that Jews require or ask more consideration than any other anti-fascist refugees , but they deserve at least as much . In the light of those figures we think it was hypocritical and unfair of Long to tell the committee that the State Department " can not exclude persons from our sympathy and our sympathetic attention if they ate not Jews , " and thus inspire Mundt of South Dakota to reply , " It seems to me that would be treading a pretty dangerous path , It is sort of doing the Hitler thing in reverse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jewish refugees get as sympathetic consideration as non-Jewish and that some agency be established , as suggested by the Baldwin-Rogers resolution , to help save the stateless Jews of occupied Europe who have no government to speak for them . The need for some such agency , and the danger of leaving the fate of these people in the hands of professional Anglo-American diplomats , is thoroughly demonstrated by Long 's attempt to confuse the issue and mislead the House Foreign Affairs Committee . Year 's End By FREDA KIRCHWEY HILE Mr. Churchill recuperates in the sun of Egypt , he should have a chance to do a little quiet thinking about this war in which he plays so pivotal a role . If he uses his enforced rest for that purpose , it will be time well spent  --  however it may irk his impatient spirit . For at the year 's end the progress of the war bears thinking about . Mr. Roosevelt , brown and healthy after his safe return from the Middle East , is reported as exuberantly optimistic . Mr. Eden , in his careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly , cheerful . Neither one told much about the results of the conferences they had attended , and perhaps nothing further can be told ; but both emphasized again the improved relations among the major Allied powers resulting from the talks . I hope their good spirits are genuine ; but so far the only evident result of the new unity is a great increase in political activity on the part of the Soviet Union . It is as if Moscow and Teheran had served as green lights assuring Russia that it could now drive ahead in Central and Eastern Europe without arousing the opposition or fear of its Western allies . Nowhere can one discern that common action which the recent talks seemed so definitely to promise . While Britain and the United States pursue their traditional policies , Moscow 's moves are rapidly changing the political structure of the Continent . The Czech-Russian treaty is an example . Planned long before Moscow and delayed as a result of British pressure , the treaty is an important stone in the construction of as new Central Europe . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czechoslovakia under RUssian protection . But he is at least establishing a connection so close as to guarantee his country against any future German threat  --  or any future Munich . The much-advertised clause inviting Poland 's adhesion may have been inserted on the insistence of London and Washington , but the - fact that both Czechs and Russians freely discuss their " common frontier " suggests that only a Poland prepared to give up its 1939 eastern boundary can share the security provided by the new pact . The Soviet Union is also hurrying matters toward a climax in the Balkans . No one knows exactly how far the direct influence of Moscow has penetrated , but it is certain that the Bulgarian Partisans , like their brothers in Yugoslavia , are encouraged and backed by Russia . In Bulgaria the division is simple . Lift off the small pro-German ruling clique and the country is solidly and traditionally with Russia . The chance of an early collapse of the Nazi-controlled regime is good ; if it comes , only a full occupation of the country by German troops can prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bulgarian army to fight the Greece presents a somewhat similar picture , although the influence of Russia is less evident . As long ago June , 1942 , The Nation published an article by Leigh White which described the attitude of Greek patriots toward King George and his reactionary regime . It was clear even then that resistance to the Germans inside Greece was weakened by the unpopular leadership of the government in exile . But Allied support of the royal government continued until just the other day , when the King issued a statement in Cairo , obviously the result of British pressure , announcing that the time of his return to Greece would " be determined when the hour of liberation " strikes . King George can not be expected actually to step down from his throne until he receives another prod . But his end is clear . And so is the end of the royal government of Yugo ' slavia . Britain and the United States are deeply committed to King Peter 's regime ; to break relations with it will seem a breach of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments . It will also , above all , announce to the world the failure of British-American diplomacy in the Balkans and the success of Russia 's policy . But the issue will have to be faced , and soon ; for the new Partisan government ha 's formally re : quested recognition , and Russia is not likely to delay long in giving it . Tito 's army constitutes the advance guard of the Allied invasion of the Balkans . If his government requires Allied recognition in order to function effectively , it will get it . The British and Americans will do what they must ; but again , as in Greece , they will do it only after events drive them to . For they never see in advance  --  never  --  that the popular forces in each occupied country are the ones to which they must ultimately turn for help . Nowhere is this more dramatically demonstrated than in Italy , where the happenings of the last few days bear out word for word the analysis by Gaetano Salvemini published in recent issues of The Nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue ; here it is necessary only to suggest that among the subjects Mr. Churchill might contemplate during his convalescence is the dismal failure of Allied strategy in Italy . For our political and military record in that country provides a good sample by which to judge British-American methods in general . Let Mr. Churchill ask himself why it is that the whole of Southeastern Europe is swinging toward Russia as toward a giant magnet . Let him ask himself why it is that in France and French North Africa and the French Levant and in Sicily and Italy popular feeling has shifted from warm friendship for the British and Americans to dull resentment . Let Mr. Churchill consider , as the year ends , how he and Mr. Roosevelt have been conducting their entire political war . power structure is being bat on the Continent - Theoretically it rests equally on the resources and energy of the three great nations that have so recently pledged their united effort for the war and the peace . Actually main underpinnings are being laid in Moscow . Day by day Russia is increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assortment of rliser " iited kings . generals and dictators , Britain and the United Stites are day by day losing the good-will of the peoples . Even their military plans are threatened by their political mistake And this , above all , is something for Mr. Churchill to think about , now that he has a little time on his hands . -
