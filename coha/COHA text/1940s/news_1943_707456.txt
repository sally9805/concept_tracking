txt ABOARD A U. S. CARRIER IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC , Nov. 29 ( Delayed ) ? Lieut . Comdr . Edward H. ( Butch ) O'Hare , famous fighter pilot . was shot down in a night air battle over the central Pacific two nights ago while American airmen were breaking up an attack of thirty or forty Japanese torpedo planes on a United States carrier force , his flying companions said today . Stories told by a squadron commander , a fighter pilot , radioman and gunner , the last to see O'Hare in the air , ' were not in complete agreement . But the action was swift and in the darkness , with the blinding of tracer fire and the flames from burning planes as the main illumination , so it was natural that none of them would know exactly what happened . " For three days Butch and I were standing by for our Japanese-stalking attack , " said Lieut . Comdr . John L. Phillips Jr. , 33 years old , of Linden , Va . " Butch was the first off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got dark . But we were lucky and were joining up when we ran smack into the Japs rendezvousing . " Butch came up on my starboard and Wingman Skon on the port Then my gunner Kernan saw a fourth plane coming up below Butch . I gave him permission to fire as soon as we were within range . At the same time I overhauled a Jap and got into his slipstream and at fifty yards knocked him into a tea kettle . " Meanwhile , on the other side of our carrier task force , thirty miles distant , a Jap dropped a series of flares for a torpedo attack illumination and our ships were clearly outlined . " I was closing in on a second Jap when the fireworks started . I was shooting at a Jap , and my gunner was shooting at a Jap who in turn was shooting at O'Hare . " My target exploded and blew up beautifully , with at least a quarter of a mile torch of gasoline trailing behind him before he hit the water . " While I was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , making a big splash . Then I thought , ' My God , that may be Butch . ' " I attempted to make contact , calling , ' Butch , this is Phil ' over and over , but I got no response . I kept thinking that the splash lasted a long time and that it may have been Butch 's parachute . Now I think it was a Jap plane which Butch shot down . " Ensign Warren A. Skon , 24 , of St. Paul , Minn. , who was flying wing on O'Hare when they started to join Phillips , said " the air was suddenly thick with Japs . " One Jap had dropped a flare and this may have been the plane Phillips shot down . " As we joined on Commander Phillips , Butch said : ' You take the Aide you want ! " I said , ' I 'll take the port . ' " ' Roger , ' he said , and that was the last word he said . " Then I saw tracers around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below us . " Among last to See Him Another version of the last seen of O'Hare , termed by President Roosevelt one of the greatest combat fliers of all time , was told by Aviation Ordnance Man Alvin B. Kernan , 20 , of Saratoga , Wyo. , who was among the last to see the commander . " I saw Butch and Skon joining up , " he said , " Then as I looked to the starboard , a fourth plane was closing in on us . It was very dark , but because I could see Skon off our port I knew this was a Jap . " I informed Mr. Phillips and he gave me permission to fire as soon as he was in range . My tracer fire seemed to go into him , but I , was blinded by tracers and my gun ' muzzle , which was white with heat . I do n't ' Tow whether I shot down the Sap . " While I was firing I saw Commander O'Hare do a wingover across the top of us and he disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he reappeared and made an outside loop . Then he was gone . " Lieut . ( J. G. ) Hazen B. Rand , 25 , of Avon , Mass. , who was shot through the foot during the action , said : " I saw a fourth plane 's guns blinking red and he was shooting at Butch while our gunner , Kernan , was shooting at the Jap . " I overheard Kernan tell Commander Phillips that he was open ! ' ing fire and Phil in turn told Butch , ' Butch , there 's a Jap plane coming into your tail . ' " Then Butch 's lights went off . I looked again and he was gone . " Relentless Search Conducted Commander O'Hare landed at Tarawa , for the first carrier plane landing there since the American conquest of the Gilbert Islands , to study the field . He also had a personal interest because he had " hellcatted " that area before and during the landing operations at Makin and Tarawa . Since dawn of Nov. 27 a relentless search for him has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The search allows for a twenty-mile drift due to the heavy Gilbert currents . An area of 2,000 square miles has been criss-crossed , boxed and scouted . Oil slicks and jetsam from enemy planes and a blue-gray overturned Japanese liferaft were found by Acting Torpedo Plane Squadron Commander Bill Privette of Chapel Hill , Va . His searching planes carried red dye markers and float lights and in their bomb bays a waterproof bag containing a radio kit and a shipwreck kit with food , water , cigarettes , , , fishing gear and blankets . The reconstructed story of the men who flew with O'Hare indicated that the lieutenant cernmander took one Japanese torpedo plane down with him . It was his ninth . But forever it will be remembered how Butch saved our task force from the heaviest and longest Japanese torpedo plane night attack , Greatest Feat Recalled Commenting on that action , Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford , commander of the task force , said : " Butch , with accompanying planes , saved my formation from certain torpedo hits . I am recomLieut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a second Congressional Medal of Honor . " An aviator who knew him said : " Despite our great engines of destruction , enormous tanks , guns of battleships and carriers  --  it remains that one determined man can settle a battle . " Butch O'Hare 's aide , Lieut . Wallace M. Parker of Pittsburgh , Pa. , added : " Butch did it twice . " Commander O'Hare received a Congressional Medal of Honor for shooting down five Japanese planes , single handed , which attempted to attack the aircraft carrier Lexington in the South Seas in 1942.
