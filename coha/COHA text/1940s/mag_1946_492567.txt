" Jean Mercier , Bron Airport . I have n't much time if the next plane 's in an hour , " he said . " But the money ! " exclaimed Louveau . He went from the fitting room into the hall where the telephone hung on the wall , and past it , and when he came back he had the bills in his band . He stood there in the plum-colored dressing gown , the needle with the length of black thread in it thrust through the cord of the lapel , the thimble on his finger still , and he counted out the thousand-franc notes . " Mountain boots in Paris , on the Rue de la Pais ! " he said , and in the name of a city and of a street spoken slowly , lingeringly , was contained the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wallet and run the tongue of the little strap through to hold them . " I would like to be going with you , " he said . In the bitter days here , I did not go , stated the silence in the room . I stayed here , I fought here when none of it was easy to do . And now , for a little while , I would like to breathe quietly , sleep for a little while in peace at night , take the gun out of my pocket here and lay it aside . When Mitchie had put the wallet into the jacket 's inside pocket again , Louveau said , " Perhaps Mercier could get you a pair of shoes . " " Yes , Mercier , " said Mitchie , but he was thinking of Pliny again as he faced GLAMOUR BOYS OF THE HIGHWAY ( Continued free , Page 15 ) " Practically all trucks . And most of them Diesels . About four hundred and fifty . Multiply that by eighteen or twenty and see what it gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway , one night . " " That 's a lot of stuff . " " The airplane guys are talking about going into the freight business . They say they 're going to give the railroads a stiff run . But the way I figure , they 'd better be thinking about Diesels . " He had a point there . Air freight may be a thing of the future where the distances are great enough to warrant the time saved in transit , but the Diesels are rolling and the Far West is still the land of the wide-open spaces . Gasoline-powered trucks still carry the greater share of the nation 's highway freight , but Diesel trucks are at home on the lonely stretches where there are no stop-and-go signals and the ribbons of concrete dissolve in the long purple shadows stretched over the desert . Highway restrictions tend to keep the heavy Diesel trucks off the roads east of Salt Lake City and Denver , but all the larger cities west of the Rockies are already tied together by truck routes on which the Diesels predominate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get six miles to the gallon . At six cents a gallon , that 's just one cent a mile , a little less than five bucks to put twenty tons of stuff over four hundred and five miles of concrete . Of course , on top of that , there 's the tax . Three cents a gallon . " I asked about unions . " Teamsters ' union , " he said . " We belong to the AFL . " " Do all drivers have to belong ? " himself in the glass . The suit was right , he could move and breathe at ease m it , as he did in mountain clothes . He felt his own breath taken and given without haste or agitation , and his eyes were as steady as if he had begun to climb a familiar mountain now , knowing exactly the way the trail took , and how high he had to go . " You look very well , very strong . I envy you , " said Louveau , and the smile split in shyness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and behind them , in the tailor 's fitting room , the black borrowed suit lay where it had fallen , without life or destiny left to it , discarded on the floor . " That individual , " said Mitchie , and he felt singularly free and guiltless as he jerked his chin in indication to where the suit lay , huddled like a dead man , on the boards . " Liquidate him , Louveau , " he said , and then he stopped speaking , his hand on the shot bolt of the door . " You spoke of a woman , Pliny 's secretary , " he said , his eyes on Louveau 's face . " If it 's part of Pliny 's story , let me have it . What else is there to it ? " " Only that she was recognized two days ago in the street , " said Louveau . " Our man checked up on her , She spent the night here in Lyon , alone in a hotel . Yesterday morning she made a round of the garages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Pliny 's secretary from 1941 until the liberation . " The girls as fearless and more devious than men , thought Mitchie in sudden shock , and they die harder than men " No , " he said with sly innocence . " No , they do n't have to . But if they did n't , who 'd load ' em ? " " What about traffic tickets . Who takes care of those ? " " That depends . Different companies have different rules . Company I work for has a rule if a driver gets nicked doing over fifty-five , he takes the rap . Mostly the cops do n't bother us much . They know we 're trying to do a job . But once in a while a cop tries to get hard , mostly around these little jerkwater joints . " " For instance ? " " Well , a couple of months ago there was a cop in a little town this side of Frisco . He 's gone now . The drivers ganged up On him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little place , about five hundred . It 's in a little valley , kinda at the bottom , with an easy grade on both sides . We rolled ' em fast down the grade , kicked ' em out when we got to the edge of town , and went through that burg like a whisper . I do n't guess there was a person in that town hardly knew there was a truck on Main Street all night . There was a cop there  --  two cops , in fact  --  and one night they got their water hot and started giving out tickets . It was speeding and coasting  --  everybody . They had ' em lined up on both sides for a mile . You never see nothing like it . " " And then what ? " " Well , it got noised around . The next night we went through that town strictly legal . We hit it slow , shifted into low low and went through every gear , gunning the motors . It WAS pretty awful . I guess they figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was just the regular night 's traffic . " " How long 'd it last ? " " About a week . They had some kind of a meeting and we beard the cops were transferred . So we started driftdie . Louveau had plucked two white threads from the sleeves of his dressing gown , and Mitchie watched them drift slowly , as if in retarded motion , to the unswept floor . Then he pulled the hall door open , and he held it , in automatic and habitual caution , scarcely ajar as he turned to shake Louveau 's hand . " I would like to be going with you ? moving out of this  --  moving , " said Louveau , and the eyes peered through the lenses at him . As Mitchie shook his hand , he felt the thimble there , still on the second finger of it . Then he crossed the landing quickly and went down the stairs . Going down , he knew that Louveau had not closed the door above , but that he stood there , motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . Believing , thought Mitchie , descending the second flight , the feet going fast , that someone would come up those stairs and ring the bell or perhaps not so much as ring . But however it happened , there would be the two drawn guns , and one would be quicker than the other  --  perhaps the one in the dressing-gown pocket not quick enough ; and then Mitchie 's hand abruptly ceased running down the polished rail . " I would like to be going with you , " Louveau 's voice seemed to say again , almost in panic , to him in the silence as he paused , and below him Mitchie saw what he had become aware of an instant before  --  the figure standing motionless in the half dark of the hall . ( To BE CONTINUED ) ing ' em through again like we used to . Nobody 's bothered us since . " " But there 's still the problem . " " Yea , sir . It looks to me like they ought to let us roll as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on a public highway and be careful ? " " I would n't say , mister . All I know is that the people want the stuff and the operators keep hollering for speed , more speed , all the time . You take my company . This job I 'm driving was brand-new when they turned her over to me . I could smell the paint on the manifold . The first night I climbed into the cab , the chief said to me , ' Look , Mario , you know how it is . Break ' em in fast and they 'll be fast . Thisloadyou 're pulling tonight 's got to be in Frisco at six-thirty . ' We have to get . ' em there , and yet they pinch us for speeding . " The southbound night traffic was beginning to thicken . There were very few cars now ; very few of anything except giant Diesels . Lit up with a score of green , yellow and white lights , they looked like Christmas trees gliding toward us out of the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinker light , and there was a constant interplay of signals between Mario and the oncoming drivers . One flash indicated a clear road ahead ; two , be on the lookout for traffic officers ; three , slow down or caution ; and four quick flashes indicated a wreck somewhere ahead on the highway . This was strictly Diesel talk ; the few cars and small gas trucks were politely ignored , but bus drivers , for some reason , were members of the Diesel fraternity . Near the foot of Gaviota Pass , drivers coming down the long grade began giving us caution signals . " Something wrong up ahead , " said Mario . " But there 's no danger of us busting into anything here . We 've got seven miles of stiff grade ahead . " ( Continued on Page 601 ( Con ed from Page 58 Mario settled down to his gears . He kept an eye on the tachometer , and as the grade stiffened and the engine speed fell to around 1600 , he shifted . There were two shifting levers , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant . A great part of the time be drove with his left arm through the spokes of the big steering wheel ; time and again , as the engine speed fell , he shifted into a lower ratio . We were crawling , and yet even here the speedometer said twenty . Trucks began closing up . It was like a parade . " Funny how they bunch up on the grades , " said Mario , " and string out on the level . If a guy passes us , you can just about figure he 's empty . " Halfway up we discovered the reason for the signaling . A truck had broken down and the driver had pulled to one side of the road . A string of red flares formed an enclosure . Using the blinker light , Mario inquired of the driver whether he needed help . The driver flashed " Okay , " and we pulled by . It was at this moment that tragedy struck . A slight pitch in the grade made another shift necessary , and Mario fumbled the gears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marto was forced to drop two gear ratios instead of only one . Our road speed fell accordingly . We were on a four-lane highway , and the driver behind fell out of line and inched up . For a time it was nip and tuck , but we lost out and the other pulled by . During the rest of the way to the summit , Mario called down upon himself all manner of reprobation and blame , " I lost a gear , " he kept repeating . It was a catastrophe of no minor sort . The ride down the opposite side of the pass was an experience I wish to forget . Near the foot of the grade was a narrow steel bridge almost completely occupied by a couple of oncoming trucks . We missed them , but even Mario , who was rather casual about such things , admitted the margin was no more than a gnat 's eyebrow . It was after midnight when we reached Ftansome 's Truck Service near the outskirts of San Luis Obispo . Ransome 's is no mere city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountain ; it is acreage with everything needed to cater to the wants of the big Diesel trucks and the men who operate them . Like the truckers , its activities are highly nocturnal . Trucks were lined up on both sides of the highway , but we pulled in for service . - We 'll eat here , " said Marto . " It 's about halfway between L.A. and Frisco . " We climbed stiffly out of the cab . A service crew  --  four men with green lettering sewed into their shirts  --  looked us over . " Fifty gallons , " said Mario . " Check everything . " That meant some twenty lights , air hoses and couplings , water , tires , various gauges , and so on . The hood was raised and a drop light swung into place over the motor . One man began bumping the tires , striking each one with a short half-inch steel rod . " One flat ! " he shouted . Mario tools a look at the tire . It was in among the cluster of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was normal , but the air was gone ; the others were carrying the load . When struck with the steel bar , it produced a dull sound like an unripe watermelon . " We 'll take it of and put on an exchange , " said the man . " Next time you come by , yours will be ready . " Mario showed me about . The place had a machine shop and garage . The grease pit was 100 feet long ; power tools were used to pull wheels and to ram nuts and studs into place . On a far corner of the lot stood a neat bungalow-type building equipped with hot and cold showers , lavatories and luxurious sleeping bunks , all of which were maintained for the drivers at no charge . This was a relay point . For some of the drivers it was the end of the run . Near the front of the office stood a call board with the names listed of the drivers coming off and those who would take the heavy cargoes through to San Francisco or Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hauled nothing but vegetable oils , milk , gasoline or tallow kept in a liquid state by heating coils ; some were fitted out with high sideracks and transported cattle , doubledeckers for smaller animals , such as sheep , pigs and calves . Many of the big van-type semitrailers loaded with fresh fruits and vegetables had built-in ice compartments or were equipped with refrigerator units powered by small , noisy motors . " Us guys sort of helped build these places , " Mario explained , with a touch of pride . " This one pumps two million gallons of Diesel fuel a year . There are three or four others on this stretch , all pretty much out in the country . Small towns cramp a Diesel man 's style when it comes to parking . " We went into the restaurant . There were four girls behind the counter , any one of whom might have won a beauty contest of some sort . The juke box was playing Night Train to Memphis . Thirty-five or forty men filled the place . There were no kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once again I was impressed by the display of beautiful dark-colored cashmere shirts that seem to be a fixed part of a Diesel man 's wardrobe . The atmosphere was relaxed , almost gay , and the talk was about trucks , more particularly about Diesel trucks . " Have you seen one of the new four hundreds yet ? " " I got my hands on one of those twocycle jobs and , boy , have they got what it takes ! " " I hear Easy Transport put blowers on all their new jobs . Steps ' em up about seventy-five horsepower . " It is excited talk , talk full of gestures and high notes of enthusiasm ; the sort of talk that goes along with pioneering , the kind that used to be heard fifty years ago beneath the circular roofs of roundhouses . And yet Diesel trucking is not something new in California . War demands in freight hauling , of course , gave it a tremendous boost , but streamers of black Diesel smoke trailed over Western highways ten years ago . While Mario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a chance to play his favorite piece on the juke box , I talked with one of his friends . " What is it , " I asked , " that makes Diesels so interesting ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " he laughed , half embarrassed . " They 're faithful ? I guess maybe that 's the way you could put it . I 've got a car at home . That old clunk I 've got setting out there on the street , I heat her up , I feed her anything and she 's always ready to go . " I talked to the manager who ran the place . " Glamour boys , " he said , looking over the crowd . " They 've got money to spend ; they 're cocky and independent . Sure , I cater to ' em . So does everybody else . I do n't care if I do n't get a dime 's worth of business but theirs . " " What about beer ? " " They do n't want it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink when they come off a run , but not while they 're on the job . They see too much drunken driving in passenger cars . . . . Good food ? Sure . That 's what brings ' em in . Ai n't like it used to be when the war was on . You can fool them once ; after that you 're just kiddin ' yourself . " Mario was ready to leave . We climbed back into the high cab . Mario lit a cigarette and settled himself behind the wheel . " I feel better , " he said . We passed through San Miguel , San Ardo , King City , Gonzales  --  each a hard day 's journey in the old days of the mission fathers who traveled back and forth on what is still called The King 's Highway . At Gonzales the highway parallels a railway track , and for a long distance we paced a passenger train , but at Salinas we left it behind .

" I 've hauled ammunition and rockets . Once I held up a ship . There was a ( Continued on Page 62 ) " Something caught my eye in the wastebasket . . . a trade journal 1 had flipped through and discarded . It was turned up to an ad which promised a 46% saving in material handling costs . When they talked about cutting my handling costs that much , well , I wanted to be shown . " Literature told how this saving could be accomplished simply through the use of a bright , shiny orange and black electric truck called ' Transporter ' . . . the miracle truck that lightens life 's loads . It was an impressive story . As a result I ordered one , and an A.T.C. Specialist showed up with it to demonstrate what they claimed . " He piled 6000 pounds of our most unwieldy product on it .

" I was more than sold on Automatic Transporters . They have cut our material handling costs 46% a solid $24,480,00 saved* ? the equivalent of 5244,800.00 worth of increased volume on a 10% profit basis .

I expected to hear a few choice curses , but he merely rubbed the back of his hand across his forehead and remarked , " Mister , it ai n't fair doing that to me after ten hours of strain at this wheel . " It was still not quite seventhirty when we pulled into the San Francisco terminal , but the place was already alive with truck drivers , mechanics and freight handlers . Trucks of various sizes were backed up to the long roofed-over dock where freight was being loaded , unloaded and transferred . Mario parked his Toad and shut off the motor . We swung down from the cab and stretched . This is a truckload cargo , " Mario explained . " From here it 'll go straight to the consignee . " " Some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other tractor  --  I hope . " He reached into the cab , brought out a shop card and began writing down various items . A couple of men who looked more like chimney sweeps than truck mechanics slouched up . Mario spoke to one of them , " She 's pretty sick , Charley . She 'll have to go in the shop . " " Yeh , I know , " said Charley . " She 's just a wreck . Well , do n't worry , kid . We 'll hold her for you until you get ready to take her . " A young girl came out of the glass-enclosed office perched high at one end of the dock . She carried a time card for Mario to sign . Mario asked , " Did you call me a cab , girlie ?

Now I tried again . I asked the girl , " Are they all as good as Mario ? " " I guess they are , " she said . " They have to be good to handle those big jobs . They 're all pretty high-caliber guys . " And that was it . Caliber has something to do with inside dimensions , and taking it all in all , I guess that sums it up ; they are all pretty high-caliber guys .
