At 56 , General Carl ( " Tooey " ) Spaatz had a lot to remember . In World War I he had shot down three planes . In 1926 , he had been a defense witness at Billy Mitchell 's court-martial . In 1929 , a major , he had commanded the Question Mark , which established the feasibility of refueling planes in mid-air-and drew some badly needed attention to a badly neglected Air Corps . <P> In World War II , as commander of the Strategic Air Forces in Europe and later in the Pacific , Tooey Spaatz had led more men in air battle than any man before in history . He had earned Ike Eisenhower 's accolade as " the world 's greatest air strategist . " <P> As the Army Air Forces ' Commanding General , he had fought the good fight for a separate air arm . When the fight was won , he had become the independent Air Force 's first Chief of Staff .

Stuart Symington chose Spaatz 's second in command , General Hoyt Sanford Vandenberg , 49 . A favored nephew of Michigan 's influential senior senator , Gen. Vandenberg rates as an able , affable officer , long on administrative ability , short on personal force . <P> After a poor start ( he graduated close to the bottom of the West Point class of 1923 ) , Vandenberg had forged a brilliant career . He was commander of the Ninth Air Force in World War II , head of Army 's G-2 and later Director of Central Intelligence for all the armed forces . He was Deputy Commander of the A.A.F. before he succeeded Ira Eaker as Spaatz 's vice chief of staff . <P> Tall , lithe and handsome , he is the airman 's idea of what an airman should look like , but some airmen felt that his lack of assertiveness was likely to handicap him in interservice arguments with the Navy and the Army .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
