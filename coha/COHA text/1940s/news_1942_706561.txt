txt Directions for Durocher It looks like lean picking for the American League in the all-star game at the Polo Grounds next Monday . If Leo Durocher , manager of the National League squad , will pitch his own Whit Wyatt , Claude Passe:au of the Cubs and Mort Cooper of the Cards for three innings each , I guarantee the Ameri- can Leaguers will go down to defeat . In fact , the way these three crack right-handers are going it wo n't surprise me a bit if the National League scores a shutout triumph . If it were n't that the rules of the game prohibit it , I am confident that Cooper alone could blank the American Leaguers over the nineinning route . With Bobby Feller gone , there 's no one in the junior circuit who can touch the Cardinal star . R. D. ENDICOTT . New York , July 2 , 1942 . Editorial Note : Decision reserved .
