The scene is the upstairs living room at Dr. Talley 's in an old brownstone house in the East Sixties in New York City . The house is a combination office and residence . The furniture is a mixture of antique and modern . Somehow , though , the amalgam is homely and cheerful rather than grotesque . Tea time of an afternoon in early Spring . AVIS and PHILIP TALLEY are on stage when curtain goes up . PHILIP is twenty-one , anxious , sensitive and charming-looking . AVIS is brilliantly attractive , a year or so younger . PHILIP sits on chair center , one leg over arm of chair , reading a book of verse . AVIS is at the telephone . She holds the receiver to her ear . AVIS TALLEY ( Hanging up ) Still busy ! PHILIP TALLEY Are you nervous ? AVIS TALLEY Not a bit . Why should I be nervous ? PHILIP TALLEY I 'm a little embarrassed . Something embarrassing , somehow , about one 's father getting married . AVIS TALLEY I do n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil and proceeds to make notes ) Besides , they 're not married yet . Maybe Dad 's just having her in for inspection . p. 3 PHILIP TALLEY Is she a femme fatale , do you suppose ? AVIS TALLEY I wonder . This time Dad seems to have applied the Talley Method with a vengeance . Imagine marrying a patient ! PHILIP TALLEY Why ? Sensible . If she has nothing more to reveal at least there must be little left to conceal . Shall we show our best side ? AVIS TALLEY Did n't know we had one . Let 's be natural . PHILIP TALLEY Then she 'll never marry Dad . AVIS TALLEY ( Satirically ) Think we 'll be able to adjust oruselves ? PHILIP TALLEY If she can , we can , I she can , all I can say is she 's highly adjustable . AVIS TALLEY ( Rises ) How much have you read ? ( She goes to telephone . ) PHILIP TALLEY Of our prospective mother 's poems ? About half . AVIS TALLEY ( She dials a number ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nicely written . Charming phrasing . What would be called , I believe  --  sensitive . p. 4 AVIS TALLEY ( By this time she has her number ) Hello . Mr.Geist , please , Manfred Geist Miss Talley Avis Talley . Thank you Hello , dear . Look here , Manfred , a rather devastating thing has happened . Dad 's bringing a bride home to meet us . Well , a fiance or intended or whatever you want to call her . It 's such a bore because I wanted to get an early start to Washington . Oh , no , I would n't think of it . Tonight 's the opening session and I would n't have you miss it for anything  --  besides , I 'm an officer . You see , darling , the Youth Congress is n't like the Federal Congress  --  every session is important . Well , come here , will you , and we 'll get off as soon as possible . Come right away . Good-bye , darling . ( She hangs up ) He 's coming over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . We can squeeze you in . Want to come ? PHILIP TALLEY No , thanks . AVIS TALLEY Do you like Manfred ? PHILIP TALLEY Very much . He 's charming  --  and something very touching about him . AVIS TALLEY Do n't pity Manfred . He 's been through everything . The rest is velvet . He does n't know it yet , but I 'm going to marry him . p. 5 PHILIP TALLEY If I did n't pity him before , I do now . AVIS TALLEY No , we 'll be wonderful together . PHILIP TALLEY If it is n't too vulgar to inquire , what are you going to marry on ? AVIS TALLEY Our youth . PHILIP TALLEY He 's twice your age . AVIS TALLEY On our hopes . PHILIP TALLEY A penniless refugee . AVIS TALLEY We 've got the future . There 'll be a new world . PHILIP TALLEY Undoubtedly . Will it be desirable ? AVIS TALLEY I think so . PHILIP TALLEY Do n't think Dad will back you in a venture like that ! AVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think I 'd let him support us ? PHILIP TALLEY You will if you have to . AVIS TALLEY I 'll translate Manfred 's books . I 'll work . We 'll manage Do n't you worry about us ! PHILIP TALLEY I 'm worried about Manfred . I like him . ( A pause ) One of his books was translated , was n't it  --  his prison memoirs ? Did anyone buy it ? p. 6 AVIS TALLEY I wish Dad and his bride would hurry up . PHILIP TALLEY Miracle , is n't it ? Dad in love ! When did he get the time , do you suppose ? AVIS TALLEY Between whiffs of anesthetic , while she was on the operating-table , he might have noticed her . PHILIP TALLEY I wonder if he felt he should provide a mother for us ? Has that occurred to you ? AVIS TALLEY Nonsense . He rushes from duodenum to duodenum . Where would he get the time to think of us ? The mystery to me is why , when she got out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad . PHILIP TALLEY Is that incomprehensible ? He 's one of the greatest surgeons in America . He 's preoccupied , I admit , but he saves people 's lives . AVIS TALLEY I wonder . He has a knack of knitting sutures . Very skillful , like tying sailors ' knots or fancy embroidering . PHILIP TALLEY Yor 're unfair to Dad . ( CY BLODGETT comes in , carrying a newspaper which he flourishes portentously . He is about twenty-four . He greets them with an embracing , flamboyant gesture . ) CY BLODGETT Well , mes enfants . Wonderful news  --  millennial ! p. 7 AVIS TALLEY Hello , Cy . PHILIP TALLEY How are you , Cy ? CY BLODGETT It will alter all our lives . AVIS TALLEY For the better ? CY BLODGETT This makes it possible for you , my dear Avis , to break forever the platinum cord that ties you to your father . For you , my good Philip , to marry your strip-tease artist . PHILIP TALLEY She 's not a strip-tease artist . She 's a fan dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fan dancer discards the fan . CY BLODGETT You will be able to buy her wondrous fans of Chinese jade . She will be able to discard a fortune in fans . As for me  --  I shall probably quit Columbia . AVIS TALLEY Come on , Cy  --  come to the gag . CY BLODGETT No gag . For six years I have been killing my leisure with post-graduate work at Columbia . You and Phil have been lured to less innocent diversions . But all that 's over . It is finished  --  we are free ! PHILIP TALLEY Are we ? I 'll bite . How ? CY BLODGETT Well , if you read this article , cold and statistical , you will find that there is no unemployment in America . p. 8 AVIS TALLEY Really ! CY BLODGETT Absolutely . Never has been . There is no unemployment at all . If we are unemployed it is because we are capricious . We 're O.K. We 're all set . I may even ask for a raise . PHILIP TALLEY You must be getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very decent honorarium , old fellow . PHILIP TALLEY If it is n't too personal , my dear Cy , how much do you get ? CY BLODGETT ( He drops his voice to a confidential tone ) Would n't want Avis to overhear , old chap ; that sort of hing makes Communists PHILIP TALLEY ( Understanding ) Naturally ! CY BLODGETT Well , just between you and me  --  man to man  --  it runs away up into the zeros . PHILIP TALLEY I 'm not surprised . You 're worth your weight in zeros . CY BLODGETT Thank you , old fellow . PHILIP TALLEY Not at all , old chap . ( They shake hands solemnly . ) AVIS TALLEY Perpetual adolescents ! ( The telephone rings . CY picks up book from table and starts to read , AVIS starts to answer the phone. ) p. 9 PHILIP TALLEY ( Jumping up and going to phone ) That 's probably for me . ( Into phone ) Hello Sybil ? I 'm sorry , darling I tried to get you before I 've got to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Club . Oh , please , Sybil , I could n't help it , honestly . When I tell you you 'll understand . CY BLODGETT ( To AVIS , as he looks through the book ) Do you think she 'll understand , Avis ? AVIS TALLEY If she does , it 'll be for the first time . PHILIP TALLEY ( At phone ) I 'll meet you after the supper show and take you to dinner . CY BLODGETT What does Sybil wear to go out to dinner in , do you suppose ? AVIS TALLEY Oh , she just clicks her costume and sallies forth . ( AVIS makes a gesture of snapping a fan open . ) PHILIP TALLEY ( Still on phone ) I 'll be there right after the supper show . Good-bye , darling . ( He hangs up . He is very angry ) I heard your bright remarks about Sybil AVIS TALLEY All in fun , Philip . p. 10 PHILIP TALLEY I want to tell you neither of you is in position to patronize Sybil ! CY BLODGETT Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humor ? AVIS TALLEY Do n't appeal to the non-existent . PHILIP TALLEY Sybil 's supporting herself and three younger sisters . She works like a slave . That 's more than any of us do . We 're parasites and she 's a worker . CY BLODGETT I 'd do a strip-tease in a minute if anybody 'd engage me . I get no offers . ( Puts down poetry book ) What about you , Avis ? Let 's see . Stand up . Turn around . ( AVIS rises and does a turn ) Take off something . ( AVIS starts to loosen her belt ) Something more strategic . ( AVIS pulls her dress up a little , reaching for her garter . ) PHILIP TALLEY You 're too damned bright , both of you . In fact you make me sick ! Where the devil is Dad ? If he does n't come in a few minutes I 'm leaving anyway  --  bride or no bride . CY BLODGETT Bride ? What bride ? Whose bride ? AVIS TALLEY Dad 's . CY BLODGETT Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALLEY Enid Fuller . CY BLODGETT The poet ? AVIS TALLEY Yes . Have you read her ? CY BLODGETT Here and there . Very subtle . PHILIP TALLEY ( He is very morose ) We 're no good  --  any of us . CY BLODGETT Do n't be defeatist , Phil . PHILIP TALLEY People like us are in the worst position . If we were downright poor  --  poverty-stricken  --  we could go on relief . If we 'd learned to use our hands instead of our heads we 'd probably be better off . But as it is there 's nothing but parasitism  --  post-graduate courses at Columbia  --  till our parents die , when we 'll probably have to borrow to meet the inheritance tax . AVIS TALLEY All of which is true  --  but what are you donig about it ? PHILIP TALLEY Not deluding myself with the millennium the way you 're doing ! AVIS TALLEY ( Rises ) You 're a self-indulgent , ineffectual little cry-baby ! CY BLODGETT ( Rises ) Avis  --  moderation ! p. 12 AVIS TALLEY You 're sentimental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in through archway . She is a very attractive woman of about thirty-five . ) PHILIP TALLEY If you say that again I 'll AVIS TALLEY What will you do  --  strike me ? PHILIP TALLEY I 'll kill you ! I ca n't bear you , Avis ; you bring our the worst in me ( ENID starts to go . CY sees her and tries to stop the fight . ) AVIS TALLEY Well , I do n't exactly have to excavate ! PHILIP TALLEY One of these days I swear I 'll just ( When PHILIP and AVIS see ENID , they subside quickly . ) ENID FULLER I 'm sorry . CY BLODGETT Little family quarrel . ENID FULLER I 'm Enid Fuller . I 've been waiting downstairs in the doctor 's office  --  getting courage to come up . CY BLODGETT You 'll find nothing here but sweetness and light  --  with a touch of murder . I 'm Cy Blodgett . ENID FULLER ( She shakes hands with him ) How do you do ? p. 13 CY BLODGETT ( Presenting ) Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip . PHILIP TALLEY ( He has not regained control of himself ) I 'm very angry . I ENID FULLER Take your time with it ! CY BLODGETT Avis Talley . ( AVIS comes to meet her . They shake hands . ) ENID FULLER Hello , Avis . Your father 's told me a great deal about you AVIS TALLEY How would he know ? ( ENID turns to CY for aid . ) CY BLODGETT Brother and sister squabble . PHILIP TALLEY She 's not my sister . CY BLODGETT Now , Phil AVIS TALLEY I was adopted when he was four to be a companion to him ENID FULLER Oh ? AVIS TALLEY Did n't Father tell you that ? ENID FULLER ( Looking from one to the other ) I 'm sure he 's forgotten which one he adopted . p. 14 CY BLODGETT That 's very graceful . AVIS TALLEY Where is the bridegroom  --  may I ask ? ENID FULLER ( Amused ) You mean your father ? The bridegroom was called on a case at the last minute AVIS TALLEY Already ? ENID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I would n't let him . I thought I 'd take the plunge by myself . AVIS TALLEY That gives you a rough idea of what you 'll be in for . ENID FULLER I 've discounted that . AVIS TALLEY We never see Father . He breakfasts too earrly and dines too late . ENID FULLER I 'll try to arrange for you to meet him . AVIS TALLEY I think the conversation would lag . ENID FULLER ( With a rather desperate , at once hopeful and helpless look at CY ) Perhaps Mr.Blodgett would come and fill in the gaps ! CY BLODGETT ( Gone for her ) Mrs. Fuller ENID FULLER Miss Fuller . p. 15 CY BLODGETT Oh , I 'm sorry . Miss Fuller ENID FULLER Yes , Mr.Blodgett CY BLODGETT If your commitment to Dr. Talley is not irrevocable ENID FULLER ( Taking courage , plays along on nerve ) Very few things in life are irrevocable , Mr. Blodgett . CY BLODGETT Will you consider me ? ENID FULLER I 'm doing it . I 'm doing it now . CY BLODGETT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year I 'll be a Ph.D . You ca n't tell what I 'll have when I 'm fifty . Will you share them with me ? ENID FULLER Am I worthy ? CY BLODGETT I feel in you , Mrs. Fuller ENID FULLER Miss Fuller . CY BLODGETT Why do I keep calling you Mrs. Fuller ? ENID FULLER I wonder . CY BLODGETT I 'll look that up tomorrow , Miss Fuller ! ENID FULLER In what ? CY BLODGETT Where were we ? p. 16 ENID FULLER You were sharing your degrees with me . If I were predatory I might take advantage of you . CY BLODGETT My impulse with you is to throw discretion to the winds . Avis , I am free of you at last ! ( Turns to ENID ) Up to now I have been in love with Avis . ( Again to AVIS ) I realize now . I have n't been too happy with you , Avis . Too much ideology , too little sex . ( To ENID ) Thank you , Miss Fuller . Thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were committed . I 'm sorry , Avis . May I call you Avis ? AVIS TALLEY Certainly . ENID FULLER I did n't know about you and Cy . AVIS TALLEY It 's all right with me . ENID FULLER I 'm sure it is n't . It could n't be . Cy is too sympathetic altogether for you to feel that way . Wait . Be patient . He will return to you . CY BLODGETT ( To AVIS ) Never ! ENID FULLER Oh , dear Cy . I feel you cooling off already . I can feel it . I could sense it by the intensity with which you just said " Never . " But it 's been charming ! I 've heard of love at first sight . I 've even written of it but I 've never experienced it . Thank you , Cy ! p. 17 AVIS TALLEY What about Dad ? Was n't that first sight ? ENID FULLER No , I do n't think so . Have any of you ever been his patient ? CY BLODGETT We ca n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to stake you  --  it 's a wonderful experience . AVIS TALLEY How is he when you 're not his patient ? PHILIP TALLEY Do n't listen to her , Miss Fuller ENID FULLER Call me Enid . Please do . PHILIP TALLEY ( Awkwardly ) Thanks ! ENID FULLER What were you saying , Philip ? PHILIP TALLEY ( Points to AVIS ) Do n't listen to her  --  to what she says  --  she 'd try to break you up . She hates Father . ENID FULLER Now , Avis , that ca n't be true . AVIS TALLEY I think if I knew him I would n't like him ! ENID FULLER Why ? AVIS TALLEY Why ? ENID FULLER Tell me why . p. 18 AVIS TALLEY ( Marshaling her thoughts exactly ) For one thing , he does n't know and does n't care not only about what goes on in this house but in the world at large . His outlook is limited to his specialty . He ca n't see beyond the end of his duodenum . ENID FULLER If yours were annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful for that concentration . PHILIP TALLEY Avis is a violent Red , though , like most Reds , she wo n't admit it . Any other shade bores her . AVIS TALLEY ( She jumps up , speaks passionately ) That 's right . That 's easy . Red . Smear the epithet and finish me . That 's all you have to do . Settles every argument . CY BLODGETT Tell me , Miss Fuller , what do you think of the Government 's policy of buying Mexican silver ? AVIS TALLEY Make fun of me , Cy . That wo n't alter me and it wo n't alter the facts . PHILIP TALLEY Would n't you like some tea , Miss Fuller ? ENID FULLER I 'd love some . PHILIP TALLEY I 'll see if I can jog up Mary . She 's willing but absent-minded . ENID FULLER Thank you . ( PHILIP goes out . A moment 's pause. ) p. 19 CY BLODGETT ( Trying to ease the silence ) How does it feel , Miss Fuller , to become a mother over-night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLODGETT Ever happen to you before ? ENID FULLER No  --  it 's the first time . ( She rises , looks at AVIS and smiles , hoping to make friends ) Tell me , Avis  --  what does Philip do exactly ? CY BLODGETT He 's in love . He 's in love with a strip-tease artist at a night club in the Village . Only he does n't like her called that . He prefers her to be called a fan dancer . We all have our odd little vanities . ENID FULLER ( To AVIS ) Do you know her ? CY BLODGETT None of us has met her . He holds her close . What do you suppose they talk about when they 're alone , Avis ? AVIS TALLEY I have n't the faintest idea . CY BLODGETT He must get a great kick out of seeing her dressed ! He 's about the only one in town . ( PHILIP comes back . ) PHILIP TALLEY ( To ENID ) In just a minute . p. 20 ENID FULLER Thank you very much . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I 've got to be leaving in a minute  --  Dad or no Dad . CY BLODGETT We 've been telling her about your romance , Phil . PHILIP TALLEY ( His back up ) Oh ! ENID FULLER What 's her name , Phil ? PHILIP TALLEY Sybil . ENID FULLER Sybil ! What a lovely name . And for a dancer  --  curiously right ! Wo n't you let me meet her , Philip ? PHILIP TALLEY ( Responding ) Yes , you can meet her . ENID FULLER Thank you . We 'll arrange it . Will you bring her to my apartment ? PHILIP TALLEY ( Almost defiantly , to show the others ) Yes . I will . CY BLODGETT ( To ENID ) Now Avis 's love-life is something else again . ( AVIS takes a step toward CY , threateningly . ) ENID FULLER Really ? CY BLODGETT Manfred Geist. p. 21 ENID FULLER ( Quite surprised ) Really ? CY BLODGETT You 've heard of him ? ENID FULLER The author of My Prison Year ? AVIS TALLEY ( Blushing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULLER Well , I have n't met him . But I 've read his book . CY BLODGETT So you were the one ! AVIS TALLEY ( Speaks eagerly ) Did you like it ? ENID FULLER It 's a wonderful book . AVIS TALLEY He 's a wonderful person . CY BLODGETT He 's nearly fifty . AVIS TALLEY ( Hotly ) What 's that got to do with it ? CY BLODGETT That tells her how old he is . ( MARY enters carrying tea tray . ) MARY I believe Mr.Geist just came in , Miss Avis . AVIS TALLEY Oh , thank you , Mary ! ( She runs out . ) ( PHILIP picks up tea table , puts it in front of ENID. ) p. 22 CY BLODGETT You see the way things are , Miss Fuller . Before this poetic refugee came on the scene , I was making a good , slow progress . But since he 's appeared , Avis wo n't even stop long enough to say " No " to me . I wish this damned war would end so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so glad about you , Miss Fuller . ENID FULLER Thank you , Mary . MARY It will be nice to have a woman in the house . ( A moment ) Everything all right ? ENID FULLER ( Smiling at her ) Could n't be better ! MARY Good ! ENID FULLER ( As she picks up tea pot ) I 'll pour . May I ? PHILIP TALLEY Of course . ( AVIS comes in followed by MANFRED GEIST . ) Hello , Manfred . CY BLODGETT Hello , Manfred . ( He rises and shakes hands with MANFRED . ENID rises . ) MANFRED GEIST ( As he shakes hand ) Hello , Cy . AVIS TALLEY This is Miss Fuller  --  my step-mother-to-be . Mr.Manfred Geist . ( They shake hands. ) p. 23 ENID FULLER I am very glad to meet you , Mr.Geist . MANFRED GEIST Thank you . I am proud . AVIS TALLEY Manfred has heard of you ! MANFRED GEIST I have done more than that . I have read you . ENID FULLER Really ? MANFRED GEIST With admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . AVIS TALLEY That 's a tribute  --  from a great poet like Manfred . ENID FULLER It is indeed . Some tea ? MANFRED GEIST Thank you . PHILIP TALLEY ( Rising ) Well , I 'm afraid I 've got to go ! Tell Dad I 'm sorry , will ou please , but I really could n't wait . Anyway , I 've met you , have n't I , and that 's the main point . ENID FULLER Yes . PHILIP TALLEY ( Shyly ) Well  --  good-bye . ENID FULLER ( Offering him her hand ) Good-bye , Philip . ( ENID and PHILIP shake hands. ) p. 24 PHILIP TALLEY When are you coming here to live ? ENID FULLER Well , as soon as I can . PHILIP TALLEY Oh , come before that . ENID FULLER Thank you very much , Philip . I hope I shall see you soon again and that I shall meet Sybil . PHILIP TALLEY I 'd love to bring her  --  when nobody else is home but you . Good-bye , Manfred . MANFRED GEIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PHILIP TALLEY So long . CY BLODGETT Catch a garment on the wing and bring it to me for a scarf . Will you , Philip ? I like vermilion . ( With a bitter look at him , PHIL goes out . ) AVIS TALLEY I 'm afraid we 've got to be going too , Manfred . ( She takes MANFRED 'S cup ) It 's a seven-hour drive to Washington . CY BLODGETT Why do n't we take the train ? With the three of us your Ford 'll be none too comfortable . Have you ridden it , Manfred ? MANFRED GEIST I have ! AVIS TALLEY If we do n't mind , you should n't . What 've you got to do ? p. 25 CY BLODGETT Just run home for my white tie . AVIS TALLEY Well , run . We 'll pick you up in half an hour . I 'll ring your door-bell twice . If you 're not there , we 'll go without you . CY BLODGETT You see me , Miss Fuller , dominated , badgered . ENID FULLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLODGETT No , Miss Fuller , I need sympathy , indulgence , appreciation . ( Moves closer to ENID ) May I come to you one day and give you the data to help you to understand me ! ENID FULLER I 'd be delighted . CY BLODGETT Thank you . Gosh , it 's wonderful to have an alternative ! ( During the following conversation MANFRED listens , amused . ) ENID FULLER What an odd boy ! Really an original . AVIS TALLEY He clowns , but he 's got a good brain if he 'd only use it . ENID FULLER On what ? AVIS TALLEY On something constructive instead of collecting useless degrees at Columbia . You see , Miss Fuller ENID FULLER Call me Enid . Please do . p. 26 AVIS TALLEY I 'd love to . You see , Enid ENID FULLER Yes . AVIS TALLEY Oh , how can I talk to you ? ENID FULLER Well , you might try AVIS TALLEY You 're very nice . One can see that only ( AVIS stops awkwardly . ) ENID FULLER What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I do n't know what your prejudices are ? Where you interests lie . What your background is . ENID FULLER Why ca n't you assume that I 'm a human being ? That is to say that I am selfish and egotistical , as it is very difficult not to be but that I am aware of it , that at my best I want to understand people and not hurt them , even help them , that if I had my way we should communicate everywhere affectionately  --  and even where possible , lovingly . AVIS TALLEY I am sure you are well-meaning . I am sure you are benevolent . But you see  --  benevolence is n't enough . ENID FULLER ( Humorously ) It seems not to be . AVIS TALLEY People in your generation had a chance . We have n't . In one way or another we 're on the dole  --  all of us . Is that to be our future ? There are millions of young people like me in this country who want their rights  --  not a dole . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face what we 're about . We 're misrepresented . In novels and plays the charm is always reserved for the aging reactionaries . We 're supposed to be ungracious and horrid And why ? Because we want to live . We want to live on our own . We do n't want to be killed in wars for objectives that are n't our objectives . We want decency and truth . ( She stops . There is a silence ) I 'm sorry . p. 27 ENID FULLER Why ? AVIS TALLEY One should n't express oneself . ENID FULLER Why not ? AVIS TALLEY Manfred says I  --  Are you angry with me , Manfred ? MANFRED GEIST Of course not . AVIS TALLEY Are you ready to go ? MANFRED GEIST Oh , yes . ( He rises . To ENID ) I 'm looking forward to this trip to Washington . I 've never been there . ENID FULLER It 's a lovely city . You 'll like it , I think . AVIS TALLEY I 'll be ready in a minute . Excuse me ? ENID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULLER I will indeed . AVIS TALLEY Thank you . MANFRED GEIST Do n't forget the book you told me about . AVIS TALLEY I wo n't . ( She goes out and upstairs . ) MANFRED GEIST I 'm not , you know . ENID FULLER I beg your pardon ? p. 28 MANFRED GEIST I 'm not the great poet Avis thinks me . I have written poetry and I have published poetry . But I am not a poet . ENID FULLER You are modest . MANFRED GEIST It is not modesty . It is criticism . As a matter of fact , you are an authentic poet  --  I am not . ENID FULLER You 've really read my verses ? MANFRED GEIST I know some of them by heart . ENID FULLER Really ! MANFRED GEIST Shall I recite one ? ENID FULLER Please not . MANFRED GEIST You said just now that each of us is vain and egotistical . How true ! My vanity is to let Avis believe that I am a great man . Like most people reading a foreign language she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ENID FULLER I can not quite believe that a reputation which crosses the Atlantic has no authenticity . MANFRED GEIST It is an adventitious reputation ! ENID FULLER After all , I 've read your book . I was fascinated . You headed a putsch in Bavaria against the first Nazis , did n't you ? p. 29 MANFRED GEIST Yes . ENID FULLER And the poems you wrote in prison  --  I read them in translation  --  I was very moved by them . MANFRED GEIST The poems had anguish and they had sincerity but these are not enough . They became famous not because they were remarkable but because I was young and they were written in prison . All these years I have had to sustain a reputation for greatness when I have only that most frequent of commodities  --  talent . ENID FULLER Courage is a kind of poetry . A high kind . A flouting of the Fates . MANFRED GEIST It 's extraordinary , really It 's extraordinary ENID FULLER What ? MANFRED GEIST It 's astonishing how under the shadow of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy can still make itself felt  --  insistent  --  insistent as a toothache . ENID FULLER Perhaps that 's lucky . That indicates we have n't given up . That indicates we are alive . That defies regimentation . MANFRED GEIST You make me feel better . Thank you . Thank you very much . ENID FULLER For what ? p. 30 MANFRED GEIST You have given me some sort of excuse , some sort of justification . You ease my conscience . ENID FULLER Is it stained with guilt ? MANFRED GEIST In a way ENID FULLER As which of us is n't ! MANFRED GEIST You know I am happy about you  --  that you are entering this family . ENID FULLER Thank you . MANFRED GEIST You 'll be good for Avis . She needs a woman like you near her . ENID FULLER I like her very much . MANFRED GEIST I feel very concerned about her . She may seem to you difficult but , believe me , she is honest  --  she is wonderful . ENID FULLER I can see that . MANFRED GEIST For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it is because I am a victim of the force she detests . It is her gesture of defiance . I am going with her to this meeting . I 'm eager to hear her speak , to see her on the platform before these thousands of people ENID FULLER A Jeanne d'Arc without armor MANFRED GEIST Yes  --  I know I should stop her from loving me . I should disappear . And yet I am pleased . I am singularly pleased . The grinning little ego whispers : You are a penniless exile . You are no longer young  --  and yet an exquisite young girl is in love with you . It must be that you are not dead yet ! ( ENID rises and goes to table for cigarette box ) I find it extraordinarily easy to talk to you . To be frank with you . Perhaps it is because I know your verses . By knowing your verses I know you . p. 31 ENID FULLER ( Offers him a cigarette ) Do you write still ? MANFRED GEIST Oh , yes  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEIST ( Takes cigarette ) Naturally  --  in German . ENID FULLER You speak so well  --  you might easily , I should think MANFRED GEIST When I get a pen into my hand , I find it is German that I write . Avis is my translator . It is part of her crusade . ENID FULLER I am sure Avis will do it well . I have confidence in Avis . MANFRED GEIST And if she does , what then ? Who wants to read a minor German writer ? Surely the world is too busy for that . ENID FULLER The minor writers are often the most endearing  --  or so I often console myself . Sometimes  --  in fact very often  --  in fact nearly all the time  --  one may prefer Herrick to Milton . MANFRED GEIST Or Heine or Goethe . ENID FULLER Decidedly . MANFRED GEIST Now all one has to do is to be Heine. p. 32 ENID FULLER For a writer to be bereft of his speech is a hard fate ! To have mastered the intimacies of a language ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to use it  --  that must be the greatest frustration of all . MANFRED GEIST Oh , there are a few giants and they tower above the divisions of language . They are international although they too have lost their natural audience in their own tongue . ENID FULLER I have thought of this  --  will you believe me when I tell you that I have thought often of this ? MANFRED GEIST You are a poet and therefore no pain is foreign to you . Your imagination spares you nothing ! ENID FULLER We live in a time when the truest voices are struck dumb by the loudest ! MANFRED GEIST Avis thinks Communism will cure everything . I wonder . How shrewd our Leader is ! There is something devastating in his propaganda that has appealed to the Fifth Column that lurks in every soul . ENID FULLER That I deny . That I repudiate . MANFRED GEIST I was cynical  --  till now . I believed that  --  till now ! ( AVIS comes in with an overnight bag. ) p. 33 AVIS TALLEY Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a mood . ENID FULLER I am grateful to you already , Avis  --  for letting me know Mr.Geist . Please let me meet more of your friends . AVIS TALLEY Well  --  shall we go ? MANFRED GEIST I am ready . You are leaving Miss Fuller alone ? AVIS TALLEY If she marries Father , she 'll have to get used to that . ENID FULLER I am used to it already . I 've been used to it for years . MANFRED GEIST Miss Fuller ENID FULLER Yes ? MANFRED GEIST I should like you to meet my daughter Ingrid . ENID FULLER I 'd love to . MANFRED GEIST Thank you . ENID FULLER What shall I tell your father , Avis ? AVIS TALLEY He wo n't ask , but if he does , tell him I 've gone to Washington . ENID FULLER When will you be back ? AVIS TALLEY In a few days . ENID FULLER You must promise to tell me all about it . p. 34 AVIS TALLEY ( Turns to ENID ) If you 're interested , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too busy , I 'll be glad to report it to you . I specialize in Youth Movements . I was nearly killed in one . ENID FULLER Let us hope you find this one more merciful . Good-bye , Mr.Geist . Pleasant journey . MANFRED GEIST Thank you . AVIS TALLEY Enid , when you do marry Father I wish you 'd get him to replace some of this furniture . Some of it comes from Dad 's old waiting room . We call it the Manic Depressive style . On that sofa have sat all the patients Father killed before he hit on the Talley Method . Father ca n't bear to throw anything away  --  not only an old idea but even an old sofa . It would break his heart . ( MANFRED manages to exchange a quizzical look with ENID and to get one word in before AVIS marches him out . ) MANFRED GEIST Oh , come now , Avis , you will admit that at least Miss Fuller is an innovation ! AVIS TALLEY ( With a quick look at ENID ) Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANFRED GEIST ( Smiling ) Courage ! ( He follows AVIS out . ) ( Left alone , ENID has a reaction . She has n't realized how much of an ordeal it was for her to face those children . She sinks down in the center chair , her arms falling limp beside her , as if she had been through violent exercise . Then she pulls herself together a little and looks around the room . She feels a certain unreality . She rises , looks at the Manic Depressive sofa , then turns and walks around looking at everything curiously . She takes off her hat , moves down to fireplace and spies a bit of marble bric-a-brac that makes her shudder . She turns , puts her hat on the desk . The office door opens and AXTON rushes in . ENID is overjoyed . She rushes to him . They embrace warmly. ) p. 35 ENID FULLER Darling DR . AXTON TALLEY Terribly sorry ENID FULLER I 'm so glad to see you ! DR . AXTON TALLEY It could n't be helped . ENID FULLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AXTON TALLEY Forty minutes late . ENID FULLER Those forty minutes ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Did you meet them ? ENID FULLER ( They let each other go ) I did indeed . DR . AXTON TALLEY Was it an ordeal for you ? ENID FULLER I did n't realize how much  --  till it was over . DR . AXTON TALLEY Sorry it had to happen this way . ENID FULLER I 'm glad it did . I broke the ice . It 's all right now , but I 'd built up in my own mind such a hazard over meeting your children . Well , I jumped it . I did it on nerve , but I jumped it . Whew , Axton ! You gave me no idea  --  they 're so bright  --  they 're so keen  --  took all I had to keep up with them . Think I did it , Axton . They 'll never know what it cost me . But I kept up with ' em ! ( A moment ) I hope ! p. 36 DR . AXTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great concern ) What is it , darling ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Bit tired . ENID FULLER You look worn out . DR . AXTON TALLEY Am rather . Lost a patient . Seldom happens to me . ENID FULLER Something go wrong ? DR . AXTON TALLEY No . Everything was right . Worked perfectly . But we mis-calculated the patient 's resistance . Died under the anesthetic . Some weakness somewhere . We did n't detect it . The postmortem will show it . ENID FULLER Who was he  --  your patient ? DR . AXTON TALLEY It was a woman . ENID FULLER What was her name ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Robinson , I think . Mrs. Robinson . ENID FULLER With you Death is anonymous , is n't it ? Like war . DR . AXTON TALLEY You know , Enid ENID FULLER Yes , dear ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I worked as well as I ever did  --  really as quickly and surely as I ever did in my life . Everything was right and yet she died . It seldom happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULLER As you made no slip  --  you ca n't blame yourself , can you ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Should n't have operated . ENID FULLER If you had n't  --  would she have lived ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Not long . But it 's her dying on the table I do n't like . ENID FULLER ( Delicately ) You wish she had done it  --  independently ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Some weakness  --  somewhere . ( ENID puts her hands on his shoulders . ) ENID FULLER Well , darling , people do have weaknesses and often these weaknesses kill them . You ca n't remedy that . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Shaking his head gloomily ) She had no stamina . ENID FULLER You must forgive her , darling . She probably meant well . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Has scarcely heard her ) Poor diagnosis ! Well ! ( He shakes it off finally , looks at her , smiles at her . She smiles back at him . They rest momentarily on a little plateau of sympathetic understanding . She sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Nice to have you here , Enid . p. 38 ENID FULLER Is it ? Is it really ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Nice to come home and find you . ENID FULLER ( Tenderly , murmurs ) Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY You 'll be happy , I think . ENID FULLER I 'm sure . DR . AXTON TALLEY How did you get on actually  --  with the kids ? Did you mind them ? ENID FULLER On the contrary . I like them very much . Although DR . AXTON TALLEY What ? ENID FULLER One thing about them I could n't quite understand . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Dryly ) There are many things about them I ca n't understand . ENID FULLER Their attitude about you  --  they do n't seem to realize how wonderful you are . DR . AXTON TALLEY If they thought I was wonderful , it would worry me quite a lot ! ENID FULLER As a matter of fact , I felt rather sorry for them . DR . AXTON TALLEY Why ? ENID FULLER They feel betrayed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . AXTON TALLEY They 're weak . ENID FULLER I did n't feel that . I felt potential strength . DR . AXTON TALLEY Look at Philip ! ENID FULLER I liked him so much . He 's charming ! DR . AXTON TALLEY These days , I 'm afraid , charm is n't enough . ENID FULLER What about Philip ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Funked medical school . ENID FULLER Did n't he work hard enough ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I did n't say he flunked . He funked . ENID FULLER How do you mean ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Could n't stand the dissecting-room . Walked out . Quit ! ENID FULLER Does n't it indicate , perhaps , that he 's not suited to medicine as a career ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Not at all . Most students get a bit nauseated in the dissecting-room . They stick it out , that 's all . ENID FULLER It 's a bitter disappointment to you , is n't it ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Shortly . He sits forward in his chair ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you done about it ? DR . AXTON TALLEY What is there to do ? I 've talked to the boy . I 've argued with him . He wo n't go back . He wo n't accept what I can offer him . Where there 's no character , Enid , you ca n't supply it . ENID FULLER Supposing he went back ; supposing he stuck it out and were mediocre , how would you feel about that ? DR . AXTON TALLEY The Talleys are not mediocre ! My father , I think I 've told you , was a distinguished Roentgenologist . His father was a country doctor in Wyoming . Philip would have been the fourth in an unbroken line . He 's broken it . Here 's a boy with a useful career set for him . A tradition set for him . He 'd have inherited my practice . Did n't want it . When I 'm dead there 'll be no Dr. Talley . It 'll be the first time since 1797 . We reach back to the eighteenth century . ENID FULLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALLEY Yes . Till it 's superseded . ENID FULLER ( Lightly ) What a passion for survival ! DR . AXTON TALLEY That 's instinctive , do n't you think ? Why do you write poetry ? ENID FULLER Because I ca n't help it ! p. 41 DR . AXTON TALLEY Maybe if the impulse were analyzed , that is what it would be found to be . ENID FULLER I wonder . Am I so vain ? To make yourself legible to your contemporaries is difficult enough  --  to chat with the future positively foolhardy ! ( A moment 's pause . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY How 'd you get on with Avis ? ENID FULLER I liked her especially . DR . AXTON TALLEY Did you ? ( A moment 's pause . ) ENID FULLER Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY Yes ? ENID FULLER You do n't see much of your children , do you ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , you know how it is , Enid . I have a large practice . It keeps me going . ENID FULLER I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do they really ? ENID FULLER They feel you 're remote from them . I can see that . DR . AXTON TALLEY As a matter of fact , Enid , you need n't worry about the children  --  not to excess . They wo n't be with us long . p. 42 ENID FULLER Really ! They seem so well ! DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Literally ) I do n't mean physically . They 're in excellent condition physically . ENID FULLER That 's good ! DR . AXTON TALLEY What I mean is that I have every expectation that they 'll soon get married . ENID FULLER Oh ? DR . AXTON TALLEY There 's some foolish young fellow sparking around Avis now ENID FULLER Cy ? DR . AXTON TALLEY His name is Blodgett , I believe . ENID FULLER That 's Cy . And sparking is mild . DR . AXTON TALLEY They 'll probably get married . ENID FULLER ( Innocently ) You think so ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Grimly ) I 'll probably have to support them , but it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her delight in her superior knowledge ) Oh , my darling , wonderful Axton ! DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Surprised ) What 's the matter now ? p. 43 ENID FULLER This brings you all the closer to me . DR . AXTON TALLEY What does ? ENID FULLER Never mind . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( A bit suspicious ) These freshets of endearment are so  --  so unpredictable ! ENID FULLER You 'll be perpetually inundated  --  make up your mind to that . But now tell me about Philip . Is he going to get married too ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I 'm hoping so . He 's interested in somebody . I 've given him several strong hints . I know she 's interested in him ! ENID FULLER Sybil ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Sybil ? Who is Sybil ? ENID FULLER Who 's yours ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Pat Ackerman , Rodney Ackerman 's daughter . He 's a patient of mine , very rich . As Phil has n't either a job or a career , he might as well marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectancy that you wo n't be bothered with either of the children very long . After they 've both gone , we can have this house to ourselves . ENID FULLER ( She puts her arms around him ) Oh , my poor darling ! p. 44 DR . AXTON TALLEY What is it now ? ENID FULLER Nothing . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , when you say " my poor darling " in that tone , I naturally conclude it is something . ENID FULLER It 's just that I 'm bewildered . DR . AXTON TALLEY About what ? ENID FULLER About your relations with your children . You seem to know so little about each other . DR . AXTON TALLEY It is n't my fault . ENID FULLER ( Frankly ) It must be , Axton  --  at least partly . DR . AXTON TALLEY I 've tried , God knows . ENID FULLER Try again . DR . AXTON TALLEY Do you think so ? ENID FULLER I would , dear , really . I 'd make an effort . Do it for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps I will . ENID FULLER ( Chiding him affectionately ) Come now , I see you filing it away in your mind . You wo n't do it . DR . AXTON TALLEY I will , I promise . p. 45 ENID FULLER ( She puts her arm through his ) Darling . You are a darling . I 'm so proud of you , Axton  --  You know what I love ?  --  To take you out to dinner , to show you off to my friends , to see you sitting there , silent and unapproachable in the welter of magnified small-talk , a Sphinx among the innuendoes DR . AXTON TALLEY Did n't care much for the literati you introduced me to . Those few dinners you took me to  --  I was bored . ENID FULLER You made that evident ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Lot of chatter . Your friends may be clever and all that . They may write well and all that , but they do n't really know anything . Lot of chatter . I never know what they 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Never , never did I love you so much as that night at the dinner-party at Waddington 's ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Waddington ! What 's he so famous for ? He struck me as trivial . ENID FULLER ( Slyly ) He made a mot about you . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Not interested ) Did he ? ENID FULLER Prompted by your unbroken silence at his dinner . p. 46 DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Still not interested ) Really ? ENID FULLER Is the Talley Method , he wanted to know , for lip-reading ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Is that funny ? ENID FULLER Not very . DR . AXTON TALLEY Too much talk everywhere . ENID FULLER I agree . DR . AXTON TALLEY Cant . Everywhere . Speeches . Phrases . Imprecise . Untested generalizations ! ENID FULLER Well , my little circle of sophisticated pals is inclined to cruelty a bit . You 're so kind , Axton . ( She looks at him ) I could cry when I think how kind you 've been to me . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been your patient to know how wonderful you are really . DR . AXTON TALLEY Do n't be deceived by my professional manner ! ENID FULLER Your infinite care , your solicitude , your patience . How wonderfully kind you were ! How strong and kind . DR . AXTON TALLEY My job ! p. 47 ENID FULLER Yes . Your job . How superbly you did it . How the nurses adored you . Just today , Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY What happened today ? ENID FULLER Well , I 'd just rung the door-bell on the way up to meet your children . I got stage fright about it suddenly . I thought : " Oh , my dear , what will I say to them ? Supposing they hate me . " To pull myself together I walked into your waiting-room to sit down for a bit DR . AXTON TALLEY Well ? ENID FULLER There was an old woman sitting there . She was waiting for instructions from your nurse . We got to talking . We got to talking about you . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me away ! ENID FULLER She blessed you , Axton . ( AXTON makes a deprecatory sound ) She told me how you saved her husband 's life  --  a motorman on the Third Avenue El . DR . AXTON TALLEY Oh , Mrs. Pink ! ENID FULLER Yes . Odd name for her . She blessed you . You 'd never taken a penny from her , she said  --  you kept coming to her tenement , countless visits , treating her husband as if he were a millionaire . She said you could n't possibly have taken more pains  --  " Not , " said Mrs. Pink , " if my husband was Mr. Rockeyfelley. " p. 48 DR . AXTON TALLEY I soak people like you in order to treat for nothing people like the Pinks ! ENID FULLER Which reminds me  --  I 've never had a bill from you . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Dryly ) I do n't want to add to my liabilities . ENID FULLER Darling ! DR . AXTON TALLEY You keep talking about what I did for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULLER ( Tremulous ) Have I , Axton ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I was lonely , Enid . I did n't know it . It 's difficult for me to say these things ENID FULLER Try ! You 've never told me , as a matter of fact DR . AXTON TALLEY Have n't I ? i thought I had . ENID FULLER Darling ! DR . AXTON TALLEY My life is quite a grind . I work till I 'm exhausted . Then I take a holiday . But holidays make me vaguely unhappy . They rest me but they upset me . I know now why . I become conscious then that I 'm alone . My next will be with you . That 's wonderful . ENID FULLER ( She puts her arms around him ) You need never be lonely again , darling . Never again . p. 49 DR . AXTON TALLEY Have I told you now ? ENID FULLER You 've conveyed it ! DR . AXTON TALLEY I love you , Enid . Yes . It 's true . ( A silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a miracle . After all my wanderings  --  emotionally , I mean  --  to have found you . It 's a miracle . Do you know , Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY What ? ENID FULLER There 's something I have n't told you . DR . AXTON TALLEY What ? ENID FULLER That before I met you , before I came under your care  --  I had reached such a state of mind that I wanted to die . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Surprised ) Really , why ? ENID FULLER I had a kind of  --  sickness of life . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Flatly ) Physical . ENID FULLER ( She turns to him ) Unfortunately , no . Spiritual . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , the fact is you did emerge . And you seemed to like it . p. 50 ENID FULLER That was you . You gave me a reason for living  --  a new lease on life . I 've got to tell you , Axton . You 've got to know  --  what a fragile creature I really am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  tell me ! ENID FULLER When I went into the hospita  --  I had reached the end of my rope . DR . AXTON TALLEY You see you were mistaken . ENID FULLER I had been hovering on the brink of psychoanalysis , but I could n't quite take the plunge . I was inhibited somehow about embarking on an endless career of audible introspection . DR . AXTON TALLEY Quite right ! ENID FULLER Nevertheless , I saw no way out . I was sick of myself and of life . DR . AXTON TALLEY Was it that nephew of yours that was killed in the plane ? ENID FULLER It was beyond even that , deeper even than that . How sick I was of the endlessly swinging arcs of my own imaginations ! Robert 's death , it is true , became a symbol to me of what the machines were doing to young life everywhere . What were my little subtleties , the thin line of communication I was trying to establish ? What if I did establish it ? The people I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could I ever affect the others ? Probably not . The same kind of people talk to each other  --  and what are we in this world of screaming death and swooping machines ? ( She puts her hand in his ) you see I am weak , darling . When I was told I had this illness , I was glad . I prayed it would do for me what I lacked the initiative to do for myself . p. 51 DR . AXTON TALLEY ( He pats her hand ) You 're too introspective . ENID FULLER Occupational disease ! DR . AXTON TALLEY What 's accomplished by that sort of mooning about ? ENID FULLER Behind it , I 'm afraid , there was something personal , in tensely personal . DR . AXTON TALLEY Oh ? ENID FULLER Behind most abstract griefs , there is a core of personal unhappiness . I 've made several bad choices , Axton  --  in love . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Brusquely ) Do n't want to hear about ' em . Stick to the present , which is myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that . ( A moment ) You know , darling , lying there in the hospital , convalescing , waiting for your step in the corridor  --  I composed a poem to you ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Oh , did you ? You never let me see it . ENID FULLER I never wrote it down . I composed it in my head . I think I could write it from memory . I believe it 's the loveliest poem I never wrote . DR . AXTON TALLEY What was it about ? p. 52 ENID FULLER Your encompassing skill , the swift virtuosity of your healing skill . I thought : While you despair , he saves . The areas sick and lost he reclaims . I thought : Here is a way of life , free and constructive and clearly good . Do many of your patients fall in love with you , Axton ? DR . AXTON TALLEY They do while they 're weak . ENID FULLER ( With a quick smile at him ) My weakness persists  --  rather , it 's supplanted by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They embrace warmly ) You know , darling , it seems to me now that always before  --  when I thought I had found love . DR . AXTON TALLEY I thought we were n't going to talk about that ! ENID FULLER No , but this is what I want to tell you : It seems to me now that there was always a premonition of doubt . This is the first time  --  this is the first time , darling , that I feel secure  --  this is the first time I feel completely  --  at home . I 'm home . DR . AXTON TALLEY Yes , of course . You are home . ENID FULLER It 's what we all want deep down , is n't it , Axton ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I suppose so . p. 53 ENID FULLER At this moment particularly , when we 're all on the verge of an abyss , it 's such a blessing  --  to know : This at least is mine , this I can count on , this will not fail me . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY comes in through the archway . Embarrassed at having intruded on this tender scene , she knocks on the archway . AXTON turns quickly , a bit embarrassed . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY Come in . Come in , Mary . MARY Dinner is served , Doctor . DR . AXTON TALLEY All right , Mary . We 'll be right down . This is Miss Fuller . ( He turns and sees ENID is still kneeling . His embarrassment returns . ) ENID FULLER Mary and I have met . MARY Indeed we have ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Where 's Philip ? MARY He 's dining out . DR . AXTON TALLEY Where 's Avis ? MARY Miss Avis has gone to Washington . DR . AXTON TALLEY What 's she doing in Washington ? MARY It 's a big meeting ! p. 54 DR . AXTON TALLEY ( To ENID ) More palaver !

AXTON TALLEY You must n't overdo ! ENID FULLER You give me confidence , and you ca n't really be gay without confidence . I 'm terrifically up and down , Axton . You 're not , are you ? How can I keep on an even keel , darling ? Will you help me to do that ? Will you be my compass ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Patiently ) A compass does not keep you at an even keel ! ENID FULLER What does ? DR . AXTON TALLEY The nautical engineers have developed  --  stabilizing instruments . ENID FULLER What are they called ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Gyroscopes. p. 55 ENID FULLER Will you be my gyroscope ? Does n't seem right , somehow . ' No , I 'd rather have you for my compass . Accurate or not , you 're going to be my compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those dikkerees .

AXTON TALLEY ( Affectionately and yet with a touch of professional severity ) Cocktails are not particularly good for you . ENID FULLER ( As they go out ) @x The same as Act one . A few days later . Afternoon . AXTON comes in . He looks around the room ; he has an almost guilty feeling at being home at this hour of the day . He rings the bell for MARY twice . His eye catches the New Masses on the telephone table . He picks it up , looks at it and into it and throws it down violently . MARY Comes in . She ca n't believe her eyes . MARY Doctor DR . AXTON TALLEY Hello , Mary . MARY Are you ill ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Why should I be ill ? MARY Home at this time of day ! What 's wrong , Doctor ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Nothing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little break between appointments . Thought I 'd come home , that 's all . What 's wrong with that ?

AXTON TALLEY Where is he ? p. 57 MARY In his room I think . DR . AXTON TALLEY Ask him if he can come down to see me , will you , Mary ? MARY Has he done something wrong , Doctor ? DR . AXTON TALLEY No , he has n't . What makes you ask an idiotic question like that ? MARY ( Worried ) Go easy on him , Doctor . DR . AXTON TALLEY For God 's sake , Mary , go and get him down here , will you ? MARY Phil means well . That boy 's got a sweet nature . He 's my pet . DR .

He has to fight to regain control of himself . MARY 'S surprise at seeing him at this untoward hour has dramatized for him rather the justice of ENID 'S charge that he has neglected his home and his children . But he masters his irritation . His eye catches the New Masses on the floor . As a symbol of his contrition , he picks it up , smoothes it out and lays it gently on the desk . But as he does so , something else strikes his eye  --  some violently anti-capitalist slogan . He picks up the magazine , examines it more closely and gets mad all over again . He slams the magazine down on the desk , just as PHILIP comes into the room ) Who reads that filth around here ? p. 58 PHILIP TALLEY It 's Avis 's , I think . DR . AXTON TALLEY Might have guessed it ! ( PHILIP is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow ) I 'm sorry , Phil . Lost my temper . Fact is ( A silence . AXTON is very self-conscious , very ill-at-ease .

PHILIP TALLEY ( He turns to AXTON ) What have I done now , Dad ? DR . AXTON TALLEY You 've done nothing . It 's I ! It 's I that am troubled . PHILIP TALLEY What have you done ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( A grand slam of confession ) I 've neglected you  --  that 's what I 've done ! ( PHILIP blinks . This is unbelievable . ) PHILIP TALLEY ( For want of anything better to say ) That 's all right , Father . DR . AXTON TALLEY It 's not all right ! p. 62 PHILIP TALLEY Perfectly all right . DR . AXTON TALLEY It is n't ! Do n't contradict me ! PHILIP TALLEY ( He turns away ) Sorry . DR . AXTON TALLEY What I mean is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , Philip , stop quibbling and let 's have a heart-to-heart talk ! PHILIP TALLEY All right , Dad . ( AXTON has to regain possession of himself again . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY I 've got to make it up to you . That 's why I knocked off and came round here this afternoon . You know I do n't often do that . PHILIP TALLEY I know you do n't , Dad . DR . AXTON TALLEY Let 's start from scratch . I was , as you know , disappointed when you quit medical school . PHILIP TALLEY I know . I could n't help it , Father . DR . AXTON TALLEY I know you could n't . Of course you 'll be the first one in four generations not to follow our profession . PHILIP TALLEY I know . I could n't help it . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Unable to keep from harping on it ) Four generations ! p. 63 PHILIP TALLEY I 'm sorry . DR . AXTON TALLEY Once I die  --  for the first time in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talley . PHILIP TALLEY Maybe you can remedy that , Father DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Puzzled ) What ? PHILIP TALLEY Maybe you can remedy it . DR . AXTON TALLEY Remedy it  --  how remedy it ? PHILIP TALLEY Well , if you and Enid DR . AXTON TALLEY What ? PHILIP TALLEY ( Feels it 's an unlucky venture , but as he 's begun it , he has to go on ) Well , if you and Enid  --  I mean to say  --  you might  --  it 's not inconceivable  --  well , I mean to say you might have a son  --  and he might be DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Blushing scarlet ) Stop it , Philip ! Stop your indecorous maundering ! PHILIP TALLEY ( Almost inaudibly ) Sorry , Father . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Really angry ) For God 's sake , I give up an important patient to have a heart-to-heart talk with you and what do I get  --  a lot of indecorous maundering ! p. 64 PHILIP TALLEY I meant  --  I meant DR . AXTON TALLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got married , of course . DR . AXTON TALLEY Stop it ! Where are you going ? PHILIP TALLEY ( Turns to AXTON ) Please , Father  --  please , Father , let 's not have a heart-to-heart talk today . DR . AXTON TALLEY We will ! PHILIP TALLEY ( Yielding to the inevitable , he sits in easy chair ) All right , Father . DR . AXTON TALLEY Now then  --  where were we ? PHILIP TALLEY I 'd just interrupted the procession of Talleys . DR . AXTON TALLEY Do n't be facetious ! PHILIP TALLEY ( Dimly ) I 'll try . DR . AXTON TALLEY I came here to say something to you and in spite of your very covious opposition , I am going to say it . It is this : I was , it is true , bitterly disappointed over your failure to follow in my footsteps as a doctor . But I think that in nurturing this disappointment I have perhaps been arbitrary and narrow . I suppose there is a world outside surgery  --  there are other careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratch , Philip . Let 's be friends . p. 65 PHILIP TALLEY ( Moved ) That 's most awfully decent of you , Father . Really DR . AXTON TALLEY I want you to forgive me . PHILIP TALLEY Oh , Dad , you make me DR . AXTON TALLEY I mean it . PHILIP TALLEY You make me ashamed . I could n't have been DR . AXTON TALLEY Nonsense ! PHILIP TALLEY Really , you do . DR . AXTON TALLEY Nonsense . Never mind the past . It 's the future . It 's the present . Let 's improve those . PHILIP TALLEY It 's most awfully decent of you . Thank you , Father . Thank you very much . Do n't think I did n't suffer over this . I felt all sorts of a fool and a weaking . It made me feel ( He is on the verge of tears . AXTON is moved also . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY Ridiculous ! My fault . Forget it . PHILIP TALLEY Yes , Father . DR . AXTON TALLEY Turn your back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking up at him squarely and smiling ) Yes , Father . p. 66 DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Turns to PHILIP ) Forgotten ? PHILIP TALLEY Yes , Father . DR . AXTON TALLEY Let 's shake hands on it . ( PHILIP , rises and they shake hands ) I feel wonderful . Do n't you ? PHILIP TALLEY Marvelous . DR . AXTON TALLEY Marrvelous sensation  --  to be friends with your son . PHILIP TALLEY Ditto  --  with your father . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( He claps PHILIP soundly on the shoulder ) My God , Philip  --  Enid 's a wonderful woman ! PHILIP TALLEY Did she put you up to this ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Not exactly . It 's just her  --  well , you know  --  her influence . She 's opened my eyes rather  --  to my own limitations . PHILIP TALLEY ( A bit too heartily ) That 's wonderful ! ( They drop the handshake . AXTON lets it pass . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY Yes Well Now , my boy , the point is  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALLEY Yes , sir . DR . AXTON TALLEY Time you settled down . Why not ? PHILIP TALLEY I 'd like to . DR . AXTON TALLEY That 's what I thought . I believe in early marriages . PHILIP TALLEY But I 'm not ready to marry yet  --  economically . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , I think we can manage that . I 'm perfectly willing to help you  --  start you off . And when it comes to that one of these days  --  unless we break down altogether  --  Pat will be quite well off . Very well off , indeed , I should say . PHILIP TALLEY Pat ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Pat Ackerman . She likes you very much , I hear . ( Jocular ) Do n't know exactly what she sees in you  --  but she sees it . I want you to know , my boy , that you have my full consent . My co-operation in every way , morally and financially . PHILIP TALLEY But it is n't Pat I want to marry . It 's Sybil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . DR . AXTON TALLEY Who on earth is Sybil ? What kind of a name is Sybil ? p. 68 PHILIP TALLEY It 's not her real name . Her real name is Hannah . DR . AXTON TALLEY Then why on earth does she call herself Sybil ? PHILIP TALLEY For professional reasons . She 's an artist . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( He takes a step toward PHILIP ) An artist ? What sort of artist ? A painter ? PHILIP TALLEY Not exactly . DR . AXTON TALLEY What do you mean  --  not exactly ? For God 's sake , Philip , ca n't you be precise even about your sweetheart 's occupation ? Who is she and what is she ? PHILIP TALLEY ( In agony ) She 's a She 's a DR . AXTON TALLEY My God , it must be something highly dubious . PHILIP TALLEY ( Turns to AXTON ) She 's a dancer . DR . AXTON TALLEY A dancer ? What sort ? Ballet ? PHILIP TALLEY Not exactly . ( With dogged desperation ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club ! PHILIP TALLEY In the village . You can see her there . p. 69 DR . AXTON TALLEY I 'll dispense with that , thank you ! PHILIP TALLEY ( He can bear no more ) Well , I love her and I 'm going to marry her and I do n't want Miss . Ackerman or her money and I do n't want a penny of yours , either . And some day I hope to pay you back every damned cent you 've ever given me  --  with interest ! ( He dashes out . AXTON finds himself alone , his appeasement policy in ruins about his feet . His anger mounts then dwindles . He considers . He came home with the best of intentions . What has happened ? He feels helpless , decides to get hold of the author of his appeasement policy . He takes out a cigar and crosses to the telephone . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Dials a number and listens a moment ) Miss Fuller , please . Thank you . Hello . Enid ? Axton . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish you 'd come over . I 'd rather tell you later . ( AVIS enters , puts her hat and purse on table ) How are you ? You 're entertaining whom ? Who 's Mr.Geist ? ( AVIS looks up suddenly at this ) A friend of Avis 's Well , here 's Avis now . Want to talk to her ? ( To AVIS ) Here 's Enid Wants to talk to you . p. 70 AVIS TALLEY ( In a hard voice ) Does she ? What about ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Annoyed ) Well , let her tell you . Do n't keep her waiting . ( His hand is over the transmitter as he says this . He gives the receiver to AVIS . ) AVIS TALLEY Yes I 'm well , thanks . Is he ? I did n't know you two were such buddies . A publishing idea well , of course , I 'll be glad to talk to you about it If he likes . Yes , Manfred I 'm well , if you 're interested You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one does what one wants to do , I find . Good-bye . ( She hangs up . She looks ahead of her , blind with misery . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Watching her curiously , he sees she is under some kind of emotional stress ) Who is this friend of yours , Geist ? AVIS TALLEY He 's a friend of mine  --  named Geist . Or was until recently . DR . AXTON TALLEY What 's he doing with Enid ? AVIS TALLEY Ask Enid . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Looks at her puzzled ; decides to drop it ) I 'm glad you came in , Avis . I wanted very much to see you . In fact , I knocked off this afternoon for that very purpose . p. 71 AVIS TALLEY Really ? What for ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Just wanted to have a cozy little  --  well , a nice little heart-to-heart talk , you might say . AVIS TALLEY What about ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Just in general . AVIS TALLEY How ? DR . AXTON TALLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a heart-to-heart talk with ? I mean  --  are we equipped for it ? DR . AXTON TALLEY You think me heartless . Is that it ? AVIS TALLEY ( In despair ) I wonder sometimes if I 'm not . DR . AXTON TALLEY Nonsense . I 'm sure you 're very warm-hearted if you 'd only let it come out . AVIS TALLEY When are you getting married ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , to tell you the truth , Avis , we 've both been almost too busy to set a date . I rather wanted Enid to get acquainted with you and Philip first . AVIS TALLEY She 's doing it with a vengeance ! DR . AXTON TALLEY What do you mean by that ? p. 72 AVIS TALLEY ( Tight-lipped ) Nothing . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Irritated ) Well , I wish you would n't be so cryptic . AVIS TALLEY Sorry . ( A moment 's pause . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY Like Enid ? AVIS TALLEY Not much . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Angry ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sort . DR . AXTON TALLEY I might have an answer to that . AVIS TALLEY I know the answer  --  so much the better for her ! DR . AXTON TALLEY What 's eating at you , Avis ? AVIS TALLEY Plenty . DR . AXTON TALLEY Tell me . AVIS TALLEY It would be no use . DR . AXTON TALLEY Try . AVIS TALLEY You know I get on your nerves . I always have . You resent me . Why do you tempt the Fates ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I want to change . I want to get to the bottom of the difficulty . I want to be friends with you . p. 73 AVIS TALLEY Why should you want my friendship ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Because I love you . AVIS TALLEY I do n't believe that . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Flaring ) Well , I might if you 'd let me . AVIS TALLEY ( Clenching her fists ) All right . I 'll let you ! ( A pause . AXTON decides to make a mental feint before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALLEY Hear you 've been in Washington . AVIS TALLEY Yes . DR . AXTON TALLEY Visiting ? AVIS TALLEY Oh , no . DR . AXTON TALLEY Sight-seeing ? AVIS TALLEY I leave that to the tourists . I went to attend the meetings of the American Youth Congress . DR . AXTON TALLEY Oh , the American Youth Congress . Really ? AVIS TALLEY Yes . DR . AXTON TALLEY Seems to me I read about it . AVIS TALLEY The press was n't very fair to us . It never is. p. 74 DR . AXTON TALLEY Were n't some of the members rude to the President ? Did n't they practically picket the White House ? AVIS TALLEY What of it ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , I think it 's an outrage . God knows I 'm not a New Dealer , but these young whippersnappers ought to learn some respect for authority . AVIS TALLEY These young whippersnappers have so far found no authority they can respect . When they do , they 'll respect it ! DR . AXTON TALLEY It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious outrages . DR . AXTON TALLEY You make it necessary for me to exercise self-control . AVIS TALLEY I 'm sorry . If you want to discuss things with me you must expect me to say what I think , not what I think you want to hear . DR . AXTON TALLEY All right , Avis . All right . I 'm sorry we got off on this . As a matter of fact I wanted to talk to you about something personal . May I ? AVIS TALLEY Certainly . DR . AXTON TALLEY You and this fellow , Cy Blodgett AVIS TALLEY Yes ? p. 75 DR . AXTON TALLEY What sort of fellow is he ? AVIS TALLEY He 's a very dear friend of mine . I like him very much . DR . AXTON TALLEY Is he ever serious ? AVIS TALLEY He 's quite serious . DR . AXTON TALLEY Few times I 've met him  --  seems to joke all the time . AVIS TALLEY That does n't mean he is n't serious . DR . AXTON TALLEY Kind of sweet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Like him ? AVIS TALLEY Very much . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , then  --  why do n't you get married ? AVIS TALLEY For lots of reasons . DR . AXTON TALLEY What 's he want to be , a teacher ? AVIS TALLEY If he can get an appointment . DR . AXTON TALLEY Useful work . Fundamental . Now , a teacher does n't earn much ; it 'll probably be difficult for you at the start . Do n't let that worry you . Fortunately , I am well able to see you through your first years . I 'll be glad to . If it 's money holding you apart  --  well  --  forget about it . p. 76 AVIS TALLEY Thank you very much . DR . AXTON TALLEY Not at all . It 's the least I can do . AVIS TALLEY What makes you so generous ? DR . AXTON TALLEY It 's not generosity . You 're my daughter . I feel I 've been perhaps  --  well , unintentionally , perhaps , a bit remiss as a father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way I can . AVIS TALLEY For what ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Irritated in spite of himself ) I 'm telling you ! For my limitations as a father . I feel I have n't always been completely fair to you . AVIS TALLEY You 're sure that motive is n't mixed with another  --  less noble ? DR . AXTON TALLEY What do you mean ? AVIS TALLEY You 're sure you do n't want to marry me off so you can get me out of your way before you settle down with Miss Fuller ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Aghast ) Why , you ungrateful little AVIS TALLEY I feel no gratitude . I 've never belonged to this house . You 've always made me feel a stranger here . I 'm not grateful too you . I do n't know who I was or what my parents were . I wish you 'd never transplanted me to this smug preserve of yours . I 'm sure , whatever it was , it would have been better than this . p. 77 DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you 'd let me be . ( ENID and MANFRED come in . ) ENID FULLER Hello , Axton . Hello , Avis . DR . AXTON TALLEY Hello . ENID FULLER You know Mr.Geist  --  Dr. Talley . MANFRED GEIST We have never met . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( In no mood for strangers , shortly ) How do you do ? ( ENID , sensing the strain in the room , looks inquiringly from AVIS to AXTON . ) ENID FULLER Well ! ( No response from anybody . ) AVIS TALLEY ( She turns to ENID ) Father and I have been having a heart-to-heart talk . ENID FULLER ( Already not expecting too much ) With good results , I hope ? ( Her hope shattered from their expression ) I 'm afraid not . ( General silence ) Well , do n't be discouraged . That sort of-thing requires practice , does n't it , Manfred ? p. 78 AVIS TALLEY I dare sy you keep in parctice all the time . Splashing around in the milk of human kindness . Shedding sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with that ? AVIS TALLEY Nothing . ( She picks up hat and purse ) Increases your circulation by leaps and bounds . And comparatively inexpensive . ( She goes out . ) ( ENID is confused and rather devastated . AXTON looks from ENID to MANFRED . He is deeply irritated . MANFRED affects him unpleasantly . ) ENID FULLER Well , really DR . AXTON TALLEY What on earth 's she driving at ? ENID FULLER ( She turns to MANFRED ) Manfred , you 'd better go and talk some sense into her . Please go after her . MANFRED GEIST And then what ? ENID FULLER You can explain . MANFRED GEIST Well , I 'll do my best . ( He goes out after AVIS . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Very irritated ) Who is that fellow ? p. 79 ENID FULLER ( She puts down hat , gloves and purse ) Manfred Geist . An Austrian refugee . DR . AXTON TALLEY Jew ? ENID FULLER No . Supposing he were ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I just asked . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him . DR . AXTON TALLEY Help him to what ? ENID FULLER To get established here . DR . AXTON TALLEY As what ? ENID FULLER He 's a brilliant writer in his own language . He 's been through some devastating experiences . DR . AXTON TALLEY communist ? ENID FULLER I 'm not sure exactly what his politics are . ( A moment 's pause . AXTON is very irritated . He is angry against her , without knowing exactly what to put it on , which adds to his irritation . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY Avis made some strange remarks ENID FULLER What about ? DR . AXTON TALLEY She 's impossible . I tried to get close to her . I took your advice . p. 80 ENID FULLER Yes ? What did you say to her ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I come to her in the friendliest spirit ENID FULLER Oh , dear ! DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Helplessly ) It seems I do n't understand anybody ! ENID FULLER It 's the most elusive of the arts , Axton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all I want to understand . ENID FULLER Ah ! That 's a handicap ! DR . AXTON TALLEY I came to her in the friendliest spirit I talked to Philip , too . He wants to marry a dancer named Sybil ! ENID FULLER I know . Phil brought her round to me . She 's very nice . A little prudish . DR . AXTON TALLEY A dancer . What kind of dancer can it be that dances in a night club in the Village ? ENID FULLER I gather her visibility is a bit high . DR . AXTON TALLEY Who is Philip to indulge himself with dancers ? ENID FULLER Is n't it rather to his credit that he does n't want to marry for money ? I find it admirable . p. 81 DR . AXTON TALLEY It 's a self-indulgence . It 's outrageous . ENID FULLER He 's very young , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY At his age , I was in my second year in medicine ! ENID FULLER Axton ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Well ENID FULLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AXTON TALLEY You know I do n't mean what ENID FULLER You 're so assured yourself . You 're so masterful yourself . Do n't you think you 're  --  well , a little impatient with people who are less sure , who may be groping and uncertain ? DR . AXTON TALLEY You seem to be on their side . ENID FULLER Well , I ca n't control a certain sympathy  --  instinctively I side with the underdog . What is that ? An apprehension that one day conceivably one might be the underdog oneself . Nevertheless , there it is ! DR . AXTON TALLEY What 's underdog about them ? They 're spoiled and irresponsible . I offered to set them up ! I even gave my consent to Avis to marry that learned idiot , Blodgett ! ENID FULLER Did you ? p. 82 DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , what 's wrong with that ? ENID FULLER Do you really think it 's magnanimous to dole out to people prerogatives they do n't want ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Increasingly annoyed and hurt ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no , dear , not at all . It 's just DR . AXTON TALLEY What ? ENID FULLER It 's just DR . AXTON TALLEY Well  --  what is it just ? ENID FULLER It 's just that I begin to suspect that perhaps you 've hidden too long in the crevices of your specialty . I am determined to lead you out ! DR . AXTON TALLEY To what ? To this rabble ? Dancers and what-not ! Who are all these people I suddenly find around me ? ENID FULLER ( Simply ) They are people , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Hopelessly ) It 's a different world . ENID FULLER Of course it is . DR . AXTON TALLEY Do n't understand it . p. 83 ENID FULLER Neither do I. We have to study . DR . AXTON TALLEY Ca n't cope with it . ENID FULLER We must try . DR . AXTON TALLEY I thought you belonged to my world . ENID FULLER Not entirely . I do n't belong to theirs either . I wish I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ENID FULLER You 've been lucky , Axton . So have I. We found our niches early in life and stuck to them . These children find no niches . No wonder they resent us . In any case our world  --  the one you and I were brought up in  --  is done with . It 's finished . And good riddance too . DR . AXTON TALLEY I like it . What was wrong with it ? ENID FULLER Too many inequalities DR . AXTON TALLEY ( After a moment he has something on his mind and feels awkward about expressing it ) Enid ENID FULLER Yes , dear DR . AXTON TALLEY Avis ENID FULLER Yes . DR . AXTON TALLEY She made certain dark innuendoes about you . p. 84 ENID FULLER Did she really ? Come , out with it , Axton . Tell me the worst . DR . AXTON TALLEY About you and that regugee fellow  --  what 's his name ? ENID FULLER Manfred Geist . DR . AXTON TALLEY About him ! Mind you , Enid , I 'm not cross-questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALLEY Only ENID FULLER Yes . DR . AXTON TALLEY May I-may I just ENID FULLER What ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I 'd like to say something to you . ENID FULLER Please do . DR . AXTON TALLEY Just once , and then forget it . ENID FULLER You can say anything to me . Anything at all . Come , darling  --  what 's worrying you ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( He rises ) I 'll say it , just this once and then I promise you , you 'll never hear a word out of me on this subject ever again . ENID FULLER Yes , darling ? p. 85 DR . AXTON TALLEY In your world  --  in your world  --  literary-artistic circles  --  Bohemain circles you might say ENID FULLER Yes , dear ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Very embarrassed ) That sort of thing  --  people condone Well , I suppose they do n't take sexual fidelity so seriously , do they ENID FULLER ( Soberly ) I think they do . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , I suppose there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might say  --  out-and-out promiscuous  --  there 's a wide margin ENID FULLER What happens in the margin ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , flirtation  --  carrying on  --  you know what I mean ? ENID FULLER Dimly . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , you know , Enid , I 'm awfully old-fashioned and  --  and  --  well , you might say bourgeois about that sort of thing  --  and I hope ENID FULLER Yes . Tell me . What do you hope ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Turns to her ) Well , damn it all , Enid . I hope you wo n't make a fool of me . I hope you wo n't make me ridiculous p. 86 ENID FULLER Oh , my dear DR . AXTON TALLEY You understand , I hope , what I mean , how I mean it . ENID FULLER I do . I think I do . DR . AXTON TALLEY Let 's forget it then . ENID FULLER I do understand and I 'm very touched by this , Axton . You ca n't possibly know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENID FULLER I see that Avis 's innuendoes  --  whatever they were  --  made quite an impression on you ! I do love you , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY Sorry I mentioned it . ENID FULLER ( She takes his hands ) I 'm glad you mentioned it . I loved it . And let me add this , now and forever , whatever there was in the past , darling , I 'm making a new life and you are the cornerstone of it . Object to being a cornerstone ? DR . AXTON TALLEY On the heavy side . ENID FULLER Could n't there be a light cornerstone ? Light but durable . Duralumin . What 's that ? In airplanes . A flying cornerstone . DR . AXTON TALLEY All right , I 'll be your flying cornerstone . ( He kisses her , then looks at his watch ) Oh , I must get down to the office . p. 87 ENID FULLER Reassured ? DR . AXTON TALLEY H 'm  --  yes . Have to see a patient . ( She stops him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cocktail party ? I 'm giving it for you to get acquainted with your children under my auspices . DR . AXTON TALLEY Ca n't cope . ENID FULLER You do n't have to . I will . DR . AXTON TALLEY All right , I 'll come back ( He starts to go . She holds his arm . ) ENID FULLER We were on the verge of a quarrel , were n't we ? DR . AXTON TALLEY No quarrel . ENID FULLER ( Laughing a little ) All right , forgive me ? DR . AXTON TALLEY For what ? ENID FULLER For whatever it was . ( She kisses him ) Good-bye , darling . DR . AXTON TALLEY ' Bye . ( He goes to office door , opens it , turns to her ) Love you . ENID FULLER Love you . ( AXTON goes out . ENID is left alone . MANFRED comes in ) Oh , Manfred , did you patch it up with Avis ? p. 88 MANFRED GEIST On the contrary ! ENID FULLER ( Starting out ) Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEIST She 's gone for a walk . ENID FULLER Surely , Manfred , she did n't resent my seeing you alone ? MANFRED GEIST She did indeed . ENID FULLER Did you tell her I 'd asked you to bring her ? MANFRED GEIST I did . ENID FULLER Did you tell her it was to talk to you about some magazine commissions ? MANFRED GEIST I did . ENID FULLER What a difficult child ! MANFRED GEIST Yes , she is . ENID FULLER People are difficult , are n't they , Manfred ? Pitiful and difficult . What was she like in Washington ? You heard her speak . MANFRED GEIST She was very good . Passionate and convincing . You should have heard her . The whole thing was wonderful and frightening , too . I have some experience of Youth Movements . This one is coherent and articulate . But I thought of the hordes outside it , incoherent and inarticulate , the raw material of the spellbinders , exactly what Germany suffered from . I sense it on all sides  --  grievance without perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manfred ? MANFRED GEIST What has happened ? More of the same . ENID FULLER Surely something will come out of all this  --  something better ? MANFRED GEIST I believe so . I sha n't see it . You may . Enid ENID FULLER Yes , Manfred . MANFRED GEIST My daughter , Ingrid ENID FULLER Yes , Manfred . MANFRED GEIST I 'd like you to know her . I 'd like you to be her friend . ENID FULLER Of course . MANFRED GEIST She has a rich , passionate nature . She is rather wonderful , really . ENID FULLER I 'm sure she is . MANFRED GEIST Unfortunately , she is quite plain . She has never attracted men . She has turned her back then on all personal romance and has concentrated on me . Like Avis she thinks I am a great man . I would like her to meet you . I want that very much . ENID FULLER But certainly . ( A pause . ) MANFRED GEIST I am afraid I 've upset Avis very much . p. 90 ENID FULLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULLER What ? MANFRED GEIST That I did not love her . ENID FULLER When ? MANFRED GEIST Just now . ENID FULLER Poor Avis . MANFRED GEIST I thought I 'd better . ENID FULLER Poor Avis . MANFRED GEIST She thinks it 's you . ENID FULLER What ? MANFRED GEIST She thinks it 's on account of you . ENID FULLER Manfred  --  no ! MANFRED GEIST It 's since you came she says  --  that I 've changed . ENID FULLER Manfred ! How awful ! How simply  --  ! What did you say to her ? MANFRED GEIST It did n't matter what I said . ENID FULLER But how utterly , fantastically MANFRED GEIST True ! ENID FULLER What ? p. 91 MANFRED GEIST How utterly , fantastically true ! ( He laughs ) How amusing of destiny , how ingeniously sadistic , to allow me , at this moment of my career , to fall in love . ENID FULLER This is not fair . MANFRED GEIST That 's what I think ? ENID FULLER What did you tell Avis ? MANFRED GEIST The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that I had never loved her . ENID FULLER You did tell her that ? MANFRED GEIST You do n't trust me suddenly ? ENID FULLER No . MANFRED GEIST You may in this . Please believe me . ENID FULLER I must find Avis . MANFRED GEIST You wo n't in your aversion from me , forget my daughter , Ingrid ? ENID FULLER Why do you express yourself with such violence ? I feel no aversion from you . It 's only that  --  in the circumstances MANFRED GEIST If I had kept silence ? And yet why should I not let you know that never in all my days have I met anyone so worthy of love as you ? Is love so common ? p. 92 ENID FULLER It does not gain by expression . MANFRED GEIST In any case , where victory is impossible , what is there to lose ? ENID FULLER There is , I think , something already lost . MANFRED GEIST The venture was so out of reality  --  as to be irresistiblee . To be among the homeless and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , one still believes in miracles . It is amusing  --  it is very amusing . ENID FULLER Manfred MANFRED GEIST Yes , Enid . Say it . ENID FULLER I want to say it exactly . MANFRED GEIST To cut off all possibility of escape ? ENID FULLER I am deeply fond of you . I am deeply touched by you MANFRED GEIST And yet ? ENID FULLER There is in you something I can not accept without reservation , something I MANFRED GEIST Distrust ? ENID FULLER Not exactly  --  deprecate MANFRED GEIST And that is ? p. 93 ENID FULLER Some men reputed for greatness have gained in stature thereby . The reputation has stimulated the reality . You it has made cynical . The disparity amuses you merely MANFRED GEIST Go on . ENID FULLER It strikes me with wonder always that with all you have suffered MANFRED GEIST Did you think that suffering ennobles ? That it filters you free of slag ? No , it is happiness that ennobles . Suffering clots the soul with a fiercer desire . I know . I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I know . ENID FULLER The Fifth Column in every soul . MANFRED GEIST Yes , Enid . ENID FULLER There is a devastating truth in that . You seem to cherish yours , Manfred . You let it betray you . MANFRED GEIST Yes . One struggles against it . You could resolve that struggle for me , Enid . What suffering has failed to do  --  you could do . ENID FULLER You will have to fight it out alone , Manfred , as in the end , we all have to do . MANFRED GEIST There are then no miracles ? ENID FULLER No , Manfred . Miracles are too easy . ( CY enters ) p. 94 CY BLODGETT As I live  --  Miss Fuller . ENID FULLER Mr.Blodgett ! How are you , Mr.Blodgett ? ( MANFRED rises . ) CY BLODGETT I am in the pink , Miss Fuller . In the pink . ( PHILIP comes in . ) PHILIP TALLEY Hello , Enid . ENID FULLER Hello , Phil . How are you ? CY BLODGETT Hello , Manfred . MANFRED GEIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 's the life-class in the Village ? PHILIP TALLEY Listen here  --  I 'm getting pretty well fed up with those bright remarks of yours ! CY BLODGETT Miss Fuller  --  you understand child psychology . What makes Philip so truculent ? ENID FULLER Never mind . ( MARY comes in with pitcher of cocktails , and six glasses on a tray ) Oh , there you are , Mary . Thank you . Ask Dr. Talley to come up , will you , Mary ? He 's in his office . MARY ( Horrified ) Now ? ENID FULLER ( Pouring cocktails ) Well  --  try it . I 'll take the responsibility . p. 95 CY BLODGETT Yes , Mary , try it . If you do n't return , we 'll know you 've been decapitated . Whom shall we notify ? MARY I 've got an older sister in Belfast . ENID FULLER Leave her name and address with the nurse ( MARY goes out . ) PHILIP TALLEY Can I help you , Enid ? ENID FULLER Yes , thank you , darling . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sweetheart around , Phil ? ENID FULLER ( Still pouring ) I invited her this afternoon , but she could n't come . ( PHILIP gives a cocktail to MANFRED . ) CY BLODGETT Oh , Sybil would n't come to a cocktail party . ENID FULLER Why not ? ( PHILIP gives a cocktail to CY . ) CY BLODGETT She does n't drink and she does n't smoke ; she just strips . PHILIP TALLEY Shut up , Cy ! ENID FULLER Really , Cy , you 're very naughty . ( She picks up a cocktail . AXTON enters from office ) Here you are at last , Axton . Cocktail ? p. 96 DR . AXTON TALLEY Thank you ! ( ENID gives him the cocktail . AVIS enters . ) ENID FULLER Oh , Avis , I 'm glad to see you . AVIS TALLEY Are you ? Hello , Cy  --  I 've got good news for you ! CY BLODGETT At last ! AVIS TALLEY Father is willing to set us up in light-housekeeping ! ( ENID is a bit afraid of AVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , it 's hardly the time or place CY BLODGETT Why not ? I congratulate you ! DR . AXTON TALLEY What for ? CY BLODGETT On acquiring me for a son-in-law . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Intensely annoyed ) Is n't it premature ? CY BLODGETT On the contrary . Belated . We were only waiting for your consent . ENID FULLER ( With a look at MANFRED , lightly ) Not Avis 's ? ( Gives a cocktail to AVIS , keeps one for herself. ) p. 97 AVIS TALLEY Thank you . CY BLODGETT Oh , you mean Manfred ? A romantic impulse which I knew would spend itself . AVIS TALLEY ( Bitterly ) You 're right . It has ! CY BLODGETT Well ! Sorry , old fellow , fortunes of war and all that sort of thing . You ca n't compete with youth , you know . In your heart you must have known all along that my adorable juvenility would win out . ENID FULLER ( Smiles at AVIS ) What can you do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AXTON ) If I congratulate Dr. Talley it is not on acquiring a son-in-law who by the time he is fifty may well have more degrees than Nicholas Murray Butler . It is more modest than that . It is on the score of economy . Tell me , Dr. Talley , are collections slow ? DR . AXTON TALLEY They are practically non-existent ! CY BLODGETT Parallels my experience . But in acquiring me you scarecely add to your burden . You see , Dr. Talley , essentially I 'm a simple fellow . I doubt whether I shall cost you more than four duodenum a year . Maybe five  --  at most five ! p. 98 DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Forcing a joke ) I shall let you have the five that do n't pay . CY BLODGETT Avis , what do you mean by telling me your father has no humor ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Did she tell you that ? CY BLODGETT Why , he 's delightful ! ENID FULLER You see , Axton  --  the light touch works wonders ! CY BLODGETT We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AXTON TALLEY I wound n't exaggerate ! CY BLODGETT But do n't let me force your hand . Shop around . I live at 116th Street and Amsterdam . DR . AXTON TALLEY Why do you tell me that ? CY BLODGETT In case you want me suddenly . DR . AXTON TALLEY It is very unlikely . CY BLODGETT ( To others ) Strong man  --  controls his impulses ! DR . AXTON TALLEY When I was your age , I was doing serious work ! CY BLODGETT So am I. When my Doctorate is published you will know beyond peradventure that St. Thomas Aquinas was a Marxian. p. 99 PHILIP TALLEY ( Rising ) Well , I 'm sorry , I 've got to be going . CY BLODGETT Have to make the supper show ? PHILIP TALLEY None of your business . CY BLODGETT You 're selfish about your girl , Philip . Awfully possessive . ENID FULLER Cy ! Cy ! CY BLODGETT He 's possessive but thank Heaven Sybil is n't . She gives you her last shirt . ENID FULLER I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Full of commiseration ) Do n't say that , Miss Fuller ! I apologize . I promise you I 'll never mention Sybil again . I 'll worship from afar . PHILIP TALLEY You make me sick ! ( He goes out . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY What kind of dancer is this Sybil ? CY BLODGETT She 's the poor man 's Pavlova . DR . AXTON TALLEY How can a busy man keep up with his children ? ENID FULLER It 's a technique you must acquire . DR . AXTON TALLEY I thought Phil was in love with Pat Ackerman . At least , Avis , I was right about you . Or was n't I ? p. 100 CY BLODGETT ( Confidently ) You will be ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Will be ? CY BLODGETT I take the long view , Dr. Talley . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , who is it now ? AVIS TALLEY Enid , you tell him ! Why do n't you tell him ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Startled  --  remembers now AVIS 'S previous innuendoes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why do you dislike me so ? AVIS TALLEY For many reasons . ENID FULLER You ca n't discourage me , you know . I am determined to win you over . AVIS TALLEY Why ? ENID FULLER Must one have a secret motive for everything ? Ca n't it be just simple affection ? AVIS TALLEY Your graciousness is very beguiling  --  especially to men . But not to me . I see through it . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Angrily ) Look here , Avis ENID FULLER Never mind , dear p. 101 CY BLODGETT ( Also seeing her danger , to shunt AXTON off ) You must n't be jealous , Avis . It 's really Platonic between Miss Fuller and me . AVIS TALLEY ( To ENID ) I 've been reading your poetry  --  the poetry , Manfred , that you admire so extravagantly . Romantic nostalgia ! MANFRED GEIST Is that wrong , Avis ? AVIS TALLEY It 's all right for those who have something to be nostalgic for . CY BLODGETT Avis , why do n't you come out and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's Aztec and it 's chic . What do you say ? AVIS TALLEY I do n't mind . CY BLODGETT You see . Just quivering with passion for me ! Ca n't wait to be alone with me ! MANFRED GEIST Why are you so hostile to Enid ? She is your eloquent defender . AVIS TALLEY ( Her head gone ) Do you defend me , too , Manfred ? MANFRED GEIST I explain you . AVIS TALLEY You do discuss me then ? You discuss me with her ! ENID FULLER Avis , believe me , you misunderstand entirely . p. 102 AVIS TALLEY It was all right before you came . You know it was . ENID FULLER ( Steadily ) I know it was n't . AVIS TALLEY He told you quickly , did n't he ? It did n't take him long to ENID FULLER Avis , my dear child AVIS TALLEY ( Fiercely ) Do n't patronize me ! ( She turns to MANFRED ) You told her ! You confide in her ! DR . AXTON TALLEY ( To ENID ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later AVIS TALLEY Will you ? DR . AXTON TALLEY What are you hinting ? Come  --  out with it  --  what are you hinting ? AVIS TALLEY ( Ignores him , turns to MANFRED ) Before she came , you understood me . You wanted to help me , to guide me . Now you 're critical of everything I do and say . You make me feel like an immature child who ( ENID looks helplessly to CY . ) CY BLODGETT We 'd better be going , Avis. p. 103 AVIS TALLEY Yes . ( She turns to ENID ) In your quiet way you 're quite a man-killer , are n't you ? ENID FULLER You 'll be ashamed , Avis . CY BLODGETT Avis AVIS TALLEY Is n't Axton enough for you ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Look here , Avis  --  I wo n't have you involving Enid in your love affairs AVIS TALLEY You 're too late for that ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Avis ! I want to know what you mean by that ! ENID FULLER Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall gratify that wish . AVIS TALLEY That wo n't be difficult for you , will it , Manfred ? Thanks to her . DR . AXTON TALLEY You 're going to come out in the open and tell me what you mean ! AVIS TALLEY As I told you before  --  ask Enid . ( She goes out . MANFRED puts his glass on mantelpiece . ) ENID FULLER Cy p. 104 CY BLODGETT Yes , Enid . ENID FULLER Do n't leave her CY BLODGETT Right . ENID FULLER Call me later , will you ? CY BLODGETT Yes . ( He goes out . ) ENID FULLER Why did you say that , Manfred ? About never seeing Avis again . MANFRED GEIST Because it is very likely to be true . ENID FULLER You know how much you mean to her  --  you should n't have said it . DR . AXTON TALLEY I 'm sorry , but it seems to me that the least Mr.Geist can do is to make good that promise . MANFRED GEIST I shall . ENID FULLER Axton , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is my good fortune ! ENID FULLER Manfred is blameless in this . MANFRED GEIST Thank you , Enid , but that is not strictly true . As I told you  --  I should have disappeared . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , it 's not too late for that , is it ? p. 105 MANFRED GEIST ( With a smile ) No  --  it is never too late for that . ENID FULLER Axton , when I 've told you the whole truth you will regret this . DR . AXTON TALLEY No more than I regret it now ! ( A moment 's pause . ) ENID FULLER Manfred  --  you 'll bring me the magazine article tomorrow ? MANFRED GEIST Tomorrow ENID FULLER Manfred headed a revolution in Bavaria . He 's written a fascinating article about it . MANFRED GEIST A memoir of failure . DR . AXTON TALLEY Why did it fail ? MANFRED GEIST We were unprepared . DR . AXTON TALLEY Then you 've no one to balme but yourselves , have you ? ENID FULLER Axton , the world at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . AXTON TALLEY Evidently it was , for the disciplined people who won out . MANFRED GEIST It was more than that  --  it was n't a matter of preparation merely p. 106 DR . AXTON TALLEY What then ? MANFRED GEIST There comes a moment in every revolution when you must kill , impartially , and by instinct . I lacked that instinct . DR . AXTON TALLEY Then you had no business heading the revolution . You should have stayed out of it . ENID FULLER I think , Axton , that without more knowledge DR . AXTON TALLEY When you undertake a job that requires ruthlessness  --  you must be ruthless . MANFRED GEIST I am sure , Dr. Talley , that your timing would have been impeccable . ENID FULLER Good night , Manfred . MANFRED GEIST ( Turning to ENID ) Good-bye , Enid . Good night , Dr. Talley . DR . AXTON TALLEY Good night . ( MANFRED goes out . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Bursts out ) Why do you encourage that awful foreign fellow to keep seeing Avis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he doing hanging around you ? ENID FULLER ( Stunned ) That question is full of epithets . Ca n't you modify it ? p. 107 DR . AXTON TALLEY I feel I 've stepped into a swamp . ENID FULLER ( Quietly ) If you have  --  you have only to withdraw . DR . AXTON TALLEY What did Avis mean ? ENID FULLER You are probably not aware of it but your tone  --  to put it mildly  --  is inquisitorial . DR . AXTON TALLEY I ask only for a simple explanation  --  what did Avis mean ? ENID FULLER Are you jealous of Manfred ? DR . AXTON TALLEY It 's not my habit to be jealous . ENID FULLER You might be just beginning . It is only on the score of jealousy that I can even begin to explain your rudeness toward him just now . DR . AXTON TALLEY I would n't be jealous of a contemptible cad such as this fellow seems to be . ENID FULLER Does he ? DR . AXTON TALLEY What else ? Plays around with Avis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else is he ? And where do you come in ? ENID FULLER You shock me , Axton ! DR . AXTON TALLEY And you do me , so we 're quits rather , are n't we ? p. 108 ENID FULLER It comes back to me now DR . AXTON TALLEY What does ? ENID FULLER With you and Manfred before  --  when he came into the room with me  --  even before you knew any of this  --  your instinctive reaction was hostile . Why ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Did you expect me to throw my arms around him ? ENID FULLER He is a refugee . He is a sensitive man . He is an artist . He is friendless , except for us , homeless , except for us . Why was your instinctive reaction  --  unfriendly ? DR . AXTON TALLEY You are demanding explanations of me when I want one of you . ENID FULLER It is because I am trying to discover between us a common speech to make my explanation  --  legible . DR . AXTON TALLEY A few simple facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often misleading . DR . AXTON TALLEY I 'll take that chance . ( After a moment ) Is this fellow Geist in love with you ? ENID FULLER He has said so . DR . AXTON TALLEY Where does Avis come in ? p. 109 ENID FULLER She 's in love with Manfred , madly . Therefore  --  and for other instinctive reasons also  --  Avis hates me . She is bitterly jealous of me . Now those are the facts . How do they sound ? Pretty bad , I can see that . DR . AXTON TALLEY You admit it ! ENID FULLER Yes . Pretty bad  --  unless , as well as knowing the facts , you also know the truth . DR . AXTON TALLEY It all sounds very messy . ENID FULLER And it 's very odd to me , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY Is it ? ENID FULLER ( After a moment ) You command an exquisite skill . You are poised and self-centered and masterful . For the practice of your profession you must have endured long years of preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with this mess ? ENID FULLER Simply that it 's odd to me that without preparation , without study , without approach , you apply summary judgments to human beings . They are in agony  --  you call it a mess and let it go at that . They are homeless and friendless and in exile  --  they are simply awful foreigners to you and you let it go at that . You do not observe  --  you do not sympathize . You apply epithets. p. 110 DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , frankly , Enid , you seem to me sloppy in your sympathies . Your sympathies are dispersed . I want them concentrated . ENID FULLER You want a monopoly . I ca n't give you that , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Bursting out ) Then I wonder why you want to marry me altogether ! ENID FULLER ( After a moment ) I do want to marry you . I admire and love you . But I hope , my dear , that it is n't hero-worship that you want . If you inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I should n't want to marry you . You are wonderfully skillful in your work . That I admire and as it saved my life , I am grateful . Really , I inhabit a world of which you know very little and that will give me privacy . Also you are strong where I am weak and that makes me want to lean on you . For all these reasons , Axton darling , I do very much want to marry you and to live with you . But do n't expect me to hero-worship you . Do n't expect me to yes you . That I wo n't do . I ca n't . I never will . You 're too good for it , darling , and so , I hope , am I. ( A silence . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY You have n't told me yet  --  what Avis meant ? ENID FULLER ( It has slipped her mind ) About what ? p. 111 DR . AXTON TALLEY About you  --  and this fellow Geist . ENID FULLER He 's a distinguished man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him as if DR . AXTON TALLEY And I wish , for pity 's sake , you 'd stop being sentimental about him because he 's a refugee . If those people could n't control a system they despise , they must take the consequences . There is a tact in conformity . As they took no interest until it was too late about what concerned them most vitally  --  namely , who should govern them and how  --  why should we now pull their chestnuts out of the fire for them ? ENID FULLER You 're a hard man , are n't you , Axton ? You 're a different person suddenly . Can it be that there is an obverse side to your wonderful efficiency ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Damn it all , Enid , it 's no use your treating me like a defendant in a trial , when the truth is . ENID FULLER The truth is that I am the defendant . Curious paradox in you , Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY No paradox at all . ENID FULLER And yet there is Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pink got to do with this ! p. 112 ENID FULLER You sound like a hard man . And yet there is Mrs. Pink . Mrs. Pink who worships the ground you walk on . I do n't understand . I 'm bewildered . How can you be so wonderful to Mrs. Pink and to Heaven knows how many others and yet so unfeeling about this poor fellow , Manfred  --  your own children ? DR . AXTON TALLEY One thing has nothing to do with the other ! ENID FULLER Evidently not . Can it be that your kindness is exclusively professional ? ( She rises ) That 's an awful thought ! That 's a frightening thought , Axton ! DR . AXTON TALLEY I make myself live up to certain standards  --  I do n't coddle myself . ( They stand looking at each other . She is seeing him as if for the first time . She is frightened and bewildered . ) ENID FULLER From some nameless source I feel a resentment against you . ( The telephone rings ) Resolve it , Axton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the telephone ) Yes who Just a moment , I 'll see Yes Who wants her , please ? Just a minute , please ( Still holding the receiver , very irritated ) It 's a Miss Geist for you ! p. 113 ENID FULLER Ingrid ! DR . AXTON TALLEY You do n't have to talk to her . I said I 'd see ENID FULLER I think I 'd better ( Goes to phone , takes instrument from him ) Thank you . Yes this is Miss Fuller Yes , Miss Geist Yes , he left about a half hour ago . What sort of message ? Well , is that unusual ? What exactly was the message ? What ? Hello ( She clicks the receiver ) Hello hello ( Astonished ) She hung up on me . DR . AXTON TALLEY Who is she ? ENID FULLER Manfred 's daughter . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , what did she want ? ENID FULLER ( She hangs up the receiver ) Asked me to come over right away . DR . AXTON TALLEY What for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious message , she says , from Manfred DR . AXTON TALLEY What did it say ? ENID FULLER She could n't tell me , she said , over the telephone . I do n't think she even said that . I wonder p. 114 DR . AXTON TALLEY Ignore it . ENID FULLER I 'm afraid I 've got to go . I 've got a funny feeling DR . AXTON TALLEY Call her back and ask her what she wants . ENID FULLER They have no telephone . She called from a pay station . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , if you must go , go after dinner . ENID FULLER I 'm going now , Axton . I 've got go now . DR . AXTON TALLEY What on earth for ? ( Looks at watch ) It 's dinner time ! ENID FULLER Please , Axton . She would n't have asked me to come unless DR . AXTON TALLEY Do you know her ? ENID FULLER No . DR . AXTON TALLEY You 're just crazy ! ENID FULLER Good night , Axton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from this refugee means more to you than I do , it 's well I found it out in time . ENID FULLER I 'm sorry . I 'll telephone . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Shouts after her ) You need n't . ( She is gone . He is in an uncontrollable rage . To steady himself he takes out a cigar and makes several attempts to light it ) Damn ! Damn ! Damn it all ! Damn ! ( MARY comes in ) p. 115 MARY Dinner is served , Doctor . Where 's Miss Fuller ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Miss Fuller has gone . And I do n't want any dinner . MARY You look sick . Shall I send for a doctor ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Are you being funny ? MARY Doctors always send for other doctors . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , I wo n't . MARY You look feverish . Have you got a fever ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Mary  --  I have no fever . For pity 's sake , leave me alone . MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thermometer . I 'm going to take your temperature if it 's the last thing I do . ( She turns and goes out . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Shouting after her as she goes ) It will be , I promise you that ! ( And with all his might he flings the cigar in his hand at the door just too late to hit the vanished MARY. ) @x At AXTON 'S  --  late that night . PHILIP is on the stage , talking on the phone . PHILIP TALLEY ( At the phone ) Thanks . I 'm sorry to bother you again . Be sure to tell Miss Fuller to call here when she comes in , will you ? Thank you . ( He hangs up . ENID enters . PHILIP is relieved to see her ) Enid ! I 've been calling you and calling you ENID FULLER I 've been out . Where 's Avis ? PHILIP TALLEY She has n't been here . Does she know ? ENID FULLER Yes . She 's been at Ingrid 's and gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? ENID FULLER Yes . PHILIP TALLEY He was here this afternoon . It seems ages ago , does n't it ? ENID FULLER Yes . It does . PHILIP TALLEY Talking  --  drinking a cocktail . What happened after I left ? Anything ? ENID FULLER ( Deciding better not to go into it ) Nothing . p. 117 PHILIP TALLEY Nothing at all ? ENID FULLER Nothing at all . PHILIP TALLEY The poor daughter  --  did you see her ? ENID FULLER Yes . PHILIP TALLEY What 's she like ? ENID FULLER Very nice . Very nice indeed . PHILIP TALLEY How did she ? ENID FULLER She was quite calm . She was arranging things , talking to Manfred 's refugee friends . There were several of them there . They were moved , but not at all hysterical . They seemed to take it for granted . PHILIP TALLEY Gosh ! ENID FULLER I wish Avis would come . PHILIP TALLEY Makes you think , does n't it ? ENID FULLER Yes , it does . ( She puts her hat and purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clever and subtle  --  was n't he ? ENID FULLER Yes . He was . PHILIP TALLEY It 's a cruel world , is n't it ? People are really cruel . There is little kindness . Why is there so little kindness ? p. 118 ENID FULLER ( Thinking out loud ) Perhaps because cruelty is at the heart of things . We wo n't face that . We wo n't admit it . Our voices are modulated and that deceives us . " We are beasts of prey , " the German philosopher keeps repeating . " We are beasts of prey " PHILIP TALLEY This afternoon  --  when you talked to him  --  was there any hint ? ENID FULLER He spoke rather strangely at the end . Some horrid idea crossed my mind PHILIP TALLEY Really ? ENID FULLER Yes . PHILIP TALLEY And did you ? ENID FULLER I did nothing . I brushed it aside . If I 'd faced it , I 'd have had to do something about it and it was easier to brush it aside . PHILIP TALLEY ( After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life surging in his mind ) Enid ENID FULLER Yes , Philip . PHILIP TALLEY You have to be strong to live , do n't you ? ENID FULLER Yes . PHILIP TALLEY Is Father strong ? p. 119 ENID FULLER I suppose so . PHILIP TALLEY Why does his strength frighten me ? ENID FULLER Perhaps because you have n't found your own . PHILIP TALLEY I funked medical school . ENID FULLER Do you feel guilty about that ? PHILIP TALLEY Yes . ENID FULLER No reason you should . It 's no law of Nature that you should be a doctor just because your father is one . PHILIP TALLEY Enid  --  you really mean that ? ENID FULLER Certainly . Find your own line and take that . There are plenty of careers still . I do n't believe the world 's quite exhausted yet . PHILIP TALLEY ( He turns to her ) Just the same I 'd like to show him ! ENID FULLER Show whom ? PHILIP TALLEY Father ! I 'd like to show him . ENID FULLER What ? PHILIP TALLEY That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you then ? PHILIP TALLEY I believe I will . I 'll go back and stick it . p. 120 ENID FULLER Perhaps that 's a good idea too . Then if you quit you 'll know you 've done it because you really do n't like it . PHILIP TALLEY I 'll try . I 'll show him ! ENID FULLER Do ! PHILIP TALLEY If I could just know , Enid ENID FULLER What ? PHILIP TALLEY That I can come and talk things over with you  --  that you 'll back me . ENID FULLER Of course I will . PHILIP TALLEY That 's marvelous . Thanks , Enid . ( AVIS comes in . PHILIP and ENID are both happy she has come back . ) ENID FULLER ( Going to her , full of pity ) Avis ! PHILIP TALLEY ( To AVIS , awkwardly ) Avis , I 'm terribly sorry . AVIS TALLEY ( Quietly ) Thank you , Phil . May I talk to Enid ? PHILIP TALLEY Yes  --  of course . ( A moment ) Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 121 ENID FULLER Avis , before you say anything , I want you to know  --  I 've been thinking of you with such pain . Avis , believe me , you misunderstood . AVIS TALLEY He left a letter for you . Here it is . ( She hands ENID the letter . In a strained voice as ENID does not open the letter , at the same time in an agony to know what it contains , his last words , his last writing ) Do you want to be alone while you read it ? ENID FULLER No . Why ? ( ENID opens the letter and reads it . It takes a second . She looks at AVIS ) Would you like to hear it ? AVIS TALLEY ( In the same strained voice ) Do n't feel you have to ENID FULLER I want you to hear it . ( She reads ) " I did n't die today . It happened long ago . When I saw you today it was already over . I tell you this in case a shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! To them I bow . Thank you for Ingrid . My love to Avis . Manfred . " ( A pause ) Poor Manfred . He should n't . He should have fought on . He should have trusted AVIS TALLEY ( She turns to ENID ) Trusted whom ? Trusted what ? p. 122 ENID FULLER You . Your strength . Your love . ( A moment . She folds the letter , puts it back in the envelope . A tremendous resolution in ENID 'S face and voice ) He bowed . We will not bow ! AVIS TALLEY ( Bitterly ) We ? ENID FULLER Yes ! We who are still free . AVIS TALLEY Manfred is dead . ENID FULLER I know there are no facile consolations . But it is true , I think , that often the victims survive their murderers . ( Rather desperately ) I must cling to that belief  --  or I 'll sink . AVIS TALLEY It is because you did not love him that his death can be an inspiration to you . ENID FULLER No  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw on our reserves of strength , not to yield to despair . Even Manfred was a victim . " The Fifth Column , " he said , " that exists in every soul . " No , I repudiate that . There are the pure in heart . There are the good . I tell you , Avis , they can move mountains . AVIS TALLEY Why do n't they then ? ENID FULLER Because they are not together . They must find each other . They must . p. 123 AVIS TALLEY Where are they , these battalions of the good ? I am sure you identify yourself with them . Where have you been all these years , you good people ? I shall not forget Manfred . But neither shall I forget his murderers . It is n't alone the machine-men who murdered him . It is the rich and the comfortable everywhere who fawned on them , who admired them , who envied their efficiency . The comfortable , the complacent , the sleek ! Those who did n't care who lived and who died as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so bitter against me , Avis ? Why against me who am part of you with my mind and all of you with my heart ? It is as if you younger generation hate us older for having survived our errors . Resent us for having known peace and security and pleasure . AVIS TALLEY Yes . We do . ENID FULLER And yet we , too , are the victims of our time . Is there any assurance that you in our place would have done better ? In spite of everything you can do or say , you are indissoluble from us . We are your heirs as you are our inheritance . AVIS TALLEY Manfred had to die at your feet . Everywhere in the world people are being slaughtered while you go on being philosophical . ENID FULLER ( Quietly ) It is true that our imaginations are feeble and that we do not really grieve for remote calamities . One can grieve deeply only for one person , whose voice we hear , whose step we know . ( A moment . AVIS is moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't look at ENID. ) p. 124 AVIS TALLEY I must tell you the whole truth . ENID FULLER Yes ? AVIS TALLEY It is n't only that ENID FULLER What else ? AVIS TALLEY It would be all right if I could say  --  my feeling against you is pure  --  ( She turns away ) but it is n't . It 's muddied up . ENID FULLER Avis AVIS TALLEY I was jealous of you ! I am still jealous of you ! ENID FULLER ( Full of feeling for her ) Avis  --  dearest Avis . AVIS TALLEY It is to you he wrote his last letter . It is you he thought of at the end . I am not pure in heart . I was jealous . You are beautiful . The moment I saw you together I thought : She is beautiful . How right she is for him . I thought : I am harsh and callow . She is serene and mellow and reposeful . ENID FULLER But , Avis , you 're so wrong ! I am not serene . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I envy you your conviction , your singleness of aim  --  dearest Avis AVIS TALLEY You did n't love him , did you ? p. 125 ENID FULLER No . AVIS TALLEY Why ? Why did n't you love him ? Enid ENID FULLER Yes , Avis . AVIS TALLEY I ca n't stay here any more with Father . I 'm leaving . I 've got to . ENID FULLER Where are you going ? AVIS TALLEY I do n't know . Some room somewhere . ENID FULLER I ca n't bear to think of you going to some dismal rooming house . Why do n't you come with me ? I have an extra room . You can stay as long as you like . AVIS TALLEY I could n't do that . ENID FULLER I 'll give you the key to my apartment . ( She takes keys out of her purse ) You can come and go as you please . AVIS TALLEY No , Enid . I ca n't do that . ENID FULLER Why not ? AVIS TALLEY I have to think things out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else can do it for you . ENID FULLER ( After a short pause ) That 's true . But do n't shut me out of your life . You 're good for me , Avis . ( She puts the key in her pocket ) Please think about it . p. 126 AVIS TALLEY ( She looks at ENID with gratitude , the gratitude of finding oneself wanted suddenly ) All right . I will . ENID FULLER ( Touching AVIS 'S arm ) Good . AVIS TALLEY Why do you bother with me ? ENID FULLER Because I have faith in you , Avis . Because I am as sure as I can be that ( AXTON comes in . ) ENID FULLER Axton  --  you 've heard the news ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Yes . I never really knew him . I 'm sorry for you and Avis  --  you seem to have liked him . I ran into Mr.Blodgett . He told me . ENID FULLER Cy ! DR . AXTON TALLEY Yes . I met him in the street . Avis had dismissed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AXTON TALLEY I left him in a bar on Madison Avenue , drinking . In fact , we had a few drinks together . Not my custom ! I find Mr. Blodgett more sensible tight than he is sober . ( ENID and AVIS exchange a look . ) AVIS TALLEY Father p. 127 DR . AXTON TALLEY Yes , Avis . AVIS TALLEY I have to tell you something . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well AVIS TALLEY I am leaving this house , Father . I have promised myself never to sleep under this roof nor take another penny of your money as long as I live . DR . AXTON TALLEY As most of your allowance money goes to support filthy radical magazines I shall be glad to discontinue it . ENID FULLER Axton ! AVIS TALLEY No , Enid , Father is right . My presence here is dishonest . Excuse me . I 'm going up to pack . ( AVIS goes upstairs . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY How does a healthy man like me come to have such difficult children ? ENID FULLER Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AXTON TALLEY This dispersed humanitarianism of yours is pernicious . ENID FULLER Not as pernicious as your concentrated selfishness . Really , Axton , it is extraordinary to me how indifferent you seem to be to the destiny of that great majority of people who do n't happen to be your patients . p. 128 DR . AXTON TALLEY Is it that I am not sufficiently grief-stricken for the late Mr.Geist ? ENID FULLER Please , Axton , do n't speak of him in that tone . I really ca n't bear it . DR . AXTON TALLEY You see , Enid , to me death is not a shock . I am used to it . I see it daily . It is the great commonplace . I help fight it . I have n't much sympathy for those who yield to it before they have to . Why should I feel anything for an anonymous foreigner who comes into my house and makes love simultaneously to my daughter and to my fiance ? ( ENID keeps quiet . He looks at her . ) ENID FULLER Again you state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , let 's drop it . I 'll never say another word about it . ENID FULLER That 's generous , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( With an odd , sudden look at her , quickly ) There was something to it then ? ENID FULLER Oh , Axton ! DR . AXTON TALLEY ( He feels he has n't handled it quite right ) The truth is it 's really ridiculous at my age  --  but the truth is I was jealous of that fellow . Plain jealous . Do you know that when you walked out on me before , I was absolutely livid with anger ? I took it out on Mary . I threw a cigar at Mary , Fortunately , it was n't lighted . Would n't it have been awful if I 'd set Mary on fire ? ( AXTON watches her narrowly , wonders if he has gained ground , goes on in the same vein ) Might have been arrested for arson . One lives and learns . Revelation to me . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let bygones be bygones , shall we ? ( She does n't answer ) Enid , you 're not listening to me ! What are you thinking ? ( CY comes in . He is a changed man . His ebullience is gone . He is tight and as severely grave as an alderman . In fact he is sepulchral ) My God , he 's in again ! p. 129 ENID FULLER How are you , Cy ? CY BLODGETT I 'm depressed . I 'm very depressed . I have been sitting with Axton in the Madison Bar drinking . I looked into your very soul , Axton . A depressing vista . DR . AXTON TALLEY You 're drunk ! CY BLODGETT There is a modicum of truth in that accusation ! ( To ENID ) Do you look down on me , Miss Fuller ? ENID FULLER Certainly not . I only wish I could cheer you up . CY BLODGETT I am beyond cheering up . Let 's face it , Miss Fuller . I 'm a failure . ENID FULLER Oh , come now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have the future . Who knows what twists and turns in the future ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I would n't delude him , if I were you , Enid , with any false hopes . CY BLODGETT ( Very confidential with her ) Supposing , for the sake of argument , Miss Fuller ENID FULLER Yes ? CY BLODGETT Supposing I do succeed in proving that St. Thomas Aquinas was a Marxian ? What then ? ENID FULLER It will demonstrate your genius for fantastic correlation . p. 130 CY BLODGETT ( Anxiously ) Are people waiting for that , do you think , in any large numbers ? ENID FULLER I am ! CY BLODGETT I shall dedicate it to you . Have you ever had a Ph.D . thesis dedicated to you , Miss Fuller ? ENID FULLER Never . I 'd be thrilled . CY BLODGETT To give you a thrill , Miss Fuller , I 'd I ca n't finish that ! ENID FULLER It 's quite all right . CY BLODGETT It was meant to build into a charming compliment  --  end in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't flourish . ( The failure depresses him even more . ) ENID FULLER Never mind . I 'll finish it for you in my own mind . CY BLODGETT She 's wonderful . DR . AXTON TALLEY Thank you . CY BLODGETT Why do you thank me ? Did I pay you a compliment ? DR . AXTON TALLEY In a way . CY BLODGETT ( Bewildered ) I did n't mean to pay you a compliment . I 'm sorry . p. 131 DR . AXTON TALLEY Do n't mention it . CY BLODGETT I do n't blame you for being in love with Enid , but why is Enid in love with you ? At least I 'm better off than you are . DR . AXTON TALLEY Now you 're switching from an understandable melancholia to an unjustified optimism . CY BLODGETT ( Protesting ) At least I do n't go around saving people . He keeps saving people . For what , I 'd like to know ? ENID FULLER So they can read your historical essays . CY BLODGETT That 's not his only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Axton and I , two jealous , frustrated men sitting in the Madison Bar . I am afraid I said too much , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY That 's your habit . CY BLODGETT ( Mournfully explaining to ENID ) The more I drink the more talkative I get . The more Axton drinks the more silenter he gets . That 's incorrect . That 's bad grammar . ENID FULLER Nevertheless I understand you ! CY BLODGETT Did you hear what Sigismund , the great medieval grammarian , said when he was dying ? p. 132 ENID FULLER No . What ? CY BLODGETT Just as Sig was passing out , his physician said to the recorder : " Sigismund shall die . " The old boy got up on one elbow and corrected him . " You mean Sigismund will die . " Is that funny ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Uproarious . CY BLODGETT ( Sadly ) In the Columbia Graduate School it has them in the aisles . ( PHILIP comes in . ) PHILIP TALLEY Enid ENID FULLER Yes , Philip . PHILIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . Do n't worry about Avis . PHILIP TALLEY ( Suddenly conscious that in AXTON 'S presence he is treating ENID as the head of the house , to AXTON apologetically ) You do n't mind , Dad ? DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Irritatedly ) Mind what ? PHILIP TALLEY Well , I mean  --  my asking Enid It 's only that I DR . AXTON TALLEY I wish you would n't be so vague , Philip ! p. 133 CY BLODGETT I sympathize with you , Axton . You are a frustrated man . DR . AXTON TALLEY I wish you 'd shut up ! CY BLODGETT I know a good psychiatrist . Or maybe if you just came up and talked to me every day . I 'm not a natural listener , but I could try . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( In despair ) Enid , will you shut him up ? ENID FULLER Shut up , Cy . CY BLODGETT Do you really mean that , Miss Fuller ? ENID FULLER Yes . I do . CY BLODGETT I shall enter a Trappist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in , wearing hat and coat , putting on gloves ) AVIS TALLEY Hello , Cy . CY BLODGETT Hello . PHILIP TALLEY Please , Avis , do n't go . AVIS TALLEY I have to . PHILIP TALLEY I 'll be lonely . DR . AXTON TALLEY When she 's here you fight like cats and dogs . PHILIP TALLEY I 'll miss it . p. 134 AVIS TALLEY Would do you good to leave , too , Phil . Might make a man of you . DR . AXTON TALLEY You see , Enid , what can I do ? She 's impossible ! AVIS TALLEY Good night , Phil . PHILIP TALLEY Good night , Avis . AVIS TALLEY We wo n't lose sight of each other . PHILIP TALLEY Please not . AVIS TALLEY Good night , Enid . ENID FULLER Here 's the key , Avis . You go ahead . AVIS TALLEY ( Takes the key ) Thank you . Good-bye , Father . DR . AXTON TALLEY Good-bye . AVIS TALLEY Coming , Cy ? ( She goes out . ) CY BLODGETT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that was , Axton , that balm ? Can you write me a prescription for it ? Maybe we can still get some on Madison Avenue . ENID FULLER You 'd better go home as soon as you can and get some rest . CY BLODGETT Rest for what ? Quoth the Raven : Nevermore . The Raven said it . Where are the snows of yesteryear ? God , I am not a man . I am an anthology ! ( He goes out . A moment 's silence. ) p. 135 PHILIP TALLEY Do you think she 'll come back ? DR . AXTON TALLEY My guess is she 'll be back in a month . PHILIP TALLEY What do you think , Enid ? ENID FULLER I do n't think so . PHILIP TALLEY What 'll become of her ? ENID FULLER She 's tough . PHILIP TALLEY I wish I were tough . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Brusquely  --  ca n't bear to have PHILIP think himself inferior to AVIS ) You 're all right , Philip ! PHILIP TALLEY No , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't have you like that intractable , unfeminine little wisp of a Spartan for anything in the world . You 're all right , I tell you . PHILIP TALLEY I wish I had n't fought with her . Half the time when I fought with her , something said to me : She 's right and you 're wrong ! DR . AXTON TALLEY It 's the other way round . What 's the matter with you , Phil ? Have n't you got any spirit at all ? ENID FULLER Axton ! Please ! p. 136 DR . AXTON TALLEY I only want him to stand on his own feet . ENID FULLER He will . Do n't worry about that . He will ! PHILIP TALLEY ( To ENID ) Have you told him  --  about my decision ? ENID FULLER No . Not yet . I will . PHILIP TALLEY Please do . Good night , Dad . DR . AXTON TALLEY Good night , Phil . Do n't worry about anything . You 're all right . PHILIP TALLEY ( Defiant ) I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , darling . ( She goes to him rather unpremeditatively , and kisses him . PHILIP is so overcome by this tenderness that he is about to burst into tears . He rushes out before it happens . There is a pause . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY What did he mean  --  Phil ? What decision was he talking about ? ENID FULLER He feels a sense of guilt evidently  --  about medical school . He thinks perhaps he ought to try again . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Delighted ) Really ? ( Exultant ) That 's wonderful . Marvelous . He 's a doctor , Enid . You 'll see . Every Talley 's a doctor . I owe you for this . Thank you , Enid . p. 137 ENID FULLER I wonder why it is DR . AXTON TALLEY You wonder why what is ENID FULLER Why it is so often that the sons of strong , successful men are beaten at the start ? DR . AXTON TALLEY Phil 's not beaten . You 'll see . I 'll keep him under my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of it . ENID FULLER He 's frightened . He 's a frightened boy . DR . AXTON TALLEY Nonsense . He has n't hit his stride yet , that 's all . He 'll hit it now . He 's all right now , I 'm sure . ENID FULLER Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY Yes , Enid ENID FULLER Does n't it strike you as strange that within fifteen minutes of meeting your children I learned more about their personal lives than you seem to have discovered in as many years . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , children will talk to the policeman on the corner before they 'll talk to their parents . Do n't you know that ? I was the same way . ENID FULLER Why do n't you face the truth , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY What truth ? p. 138 ENID FULLER That you are a failure as a father . I am very much afraid that the Talley Method is n't enough . It seems to be wonderful on anaesthetized tissue . For human beings not yet anaesthetized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Cajolingly ) It worked with you ! ENID FULLER Oh , my dear , if your approach in the operating theater were as fumbling as it is in your living room I should n't be here to tell it . Nobody would . DR . AXTON TALLEY Well , in spite of my clumsy approach , Phil 's coming through . I ca n't tell you , Enid , how pleased I am about that . And grateful to you . From now on things should go smoothly . ( Whistles energetically with relief ) Bad moment or two . Well , thank heaven it 's over . We 've survived our first quarrel . ( ENID looks at him quickly ) Well , not exactly quarrel  --  let 's say misunderstanding . May there never be another ! Enid , what 's the matter ? What are you thinking ? ENID FULLER The truth is  --  I feel sick at heart . DR . AXTON TALLEY Why ? ENID FULLER That I should have been so wrong . DR . AXTON TALLEY What about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . AXTON TALLEY Perhaps we 're not as far off as you think . ENID FULLER We 're world 's away . DR . AXTON TALLEY With improved communications we might get in touch . ENID FULLER Do n't humor me , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY My God , Enid , have I been wrong about you ? Are you capricious ? ENID FULLER I do n't really think so . DR . AXTON TALLEY What do you mean then , for God 's sake , by talking like this ? Just when everything 's getting settled . ENID FULLER No , it is n't . Everything is n't settled . It 's far from settled . It 's very unsettled . DR . AXTON TALLEY For instance . ENID FULLER I suppose that in ordinary times you and I might have made a go of it . But these are not ordinary times . DR . AXTON TALLEY What have the times got to do with this ? ENID FULLER Everything . You can no longer live in a sound-proof room  --  in a spiritual autarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new life  --  that I was to be its cornerstone . p. 140 ENID FULLER That was before I found out  --  before I saw DR . AXTON TALLEY What ? ENID FULLER Your effect on those around you . I have come to see  --  reluctantly  --  I have come to see that your effect on those whom you can not aid with your mechanical skill is destructive . You are arrogant , Axton . You want to impose your ideas and your way of life on others . You have no more sense of the individual than a machine-gun . DR . AXTON TALLEY Who are you to pass these judgments on me ? ENID FULLER It 's what I think . I have seen you with your own children . DR . AXTON TALLEY I must tell you , Enid , that I think your sympathy for the children is maudlin . It 's what 's ruined them  --  a whole generation of them . ENID FULLER Come now , you ca n't condemn an entire generation . DR . AXTON TALLEY Each generation has to justify itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his fingers burned off with radium  --  his hands reduced to stumps . Yet he got less for it than these young revolutionaries on the dole , which they find insufficient . Do n't talk to me about these impromptu hordes in this country or any other . I despise them and the cant that caters to them . p. 141 ENID FULLER You have a contempt for people , Axton . DR . AXTON TALLEY The truth is  --  you 're a sentimentalist . I 'm a realist , that 's all . ENID FULLER The realists seem to have a wonderful capacity for turning their backs on injustice and suffering . DR . AXTON TALLEY It 's that I ca n't endure muddle . Do n't you see that ? I love order . I watch the disintegration of the cell and I feel a cold fury inside of me that I can not stop it . ENID FULLER What about the disintegration around you ? Why does n't that arouse you to fury  --  a fury against yourself ? Since coming into your house I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen blundering . I have blundered also  --  had I spoken differently to Manfred  --  had I found the word  --  a word that might have saved him . I did n't find it . I did n't say it . I have been clumsy and inadequate also . But you shut your failure away from you . You are consoled because you save people 's lives . But you have to do more than save people 's lives . You have to give them something to live for . No , Axton  --  there is a realm beyond efficiency . Through you I became gay again and strong again and confident again DR . AXTON TALLEY Well then ? p. 142 ENID FULLER But you do n't really want me that way . You prefer me as I was . You do n't want a companion to share with you and differ from you . You want a patient . Well , I am cured now . I am strong now . I am myself now . I want to use the life you gave me freely and abundantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a vacuum into which you want to draw me . I 'm frightened , Axton DR . AXTON TALLEY ( He takes a step toward her ) What are you frightened of , for God 's sake ? ENID FULLER There are destructive forces in the world now of violence and ruthlessness , and I am frightened of the things I find in you which are like those forces . I 'm sorry , Axton , but I ca n't possibly marry you . DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Deeply shocked ) You 're leaving me ENID FULLER I have to . DR . AXTON TALLEY My God , you 're not going to let a difference in point of view separate us . ENID FULLER But that 's all that ever does separate people . In the passion of first love  --  in youth  --  such a difference might be obliterated . But you and I DR . AXTON TALLEY What good does it do me to be right if I 'm miserable ? p. 143 ENID FULLER Forgive me , Axton , but that seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be miserable . Is n't pain a symptom ? DR . AXTON TALLEY I am willing to make concessions . ENID FULLER I do n't want concessions . I want a change of heart , Axton . Can you perform that major operation ? DR . AXTON TALLEY It is n't exactly fair to make me pay for not living up to your romantic idealization of me . ENID FULLER Perhaps not . It must have been your professional manner . You warned me against it . But it 's so beautiful , Axton , you ca n't blame me for being taken in by it . Better modify it in the future or you 'll get involved again . DR . AXTON TALLEY Do n't talk rot . It 's either you or nobody , and you know it damn well ! ENID FULLER That 's very sweet of you ( She puts on her hat and picks up her purse . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Gloomily ) It 'd better be nobody , I guess . I ca n't cope . ENID FULLER Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 144 ENID FULLER Nonsense . In a sense I 'm going to begin again ( AXTON looks at her sharply ) with your children , for instance . Avis is at my house now . I 'm going to keep her with me for as long as I can . DR . AXTON TALLEY You 're a masochist . ENID FULLER No , on the contrary  --  I 've got two new interests . It 'll be great fun . I 'm really grateful to you , Axton , I 've always wanted to have children . Thank you very much . DR . AXTON TALLEY I do n't like you ! Definitely ! ENID FULLER I keep telling you . Good night , Axton . ( She goes to him and offers her hand . They shake hands . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY Shall I take you home ? ENID FULLER No , you 're tired . You have to operate in the morning . I want to walk anyway . DR . AXTON TALLEY Then it 's hopeless ? ENID FULLER For the good-willing , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Axton ? DR . AXTON TALLEY What ? ENID FULLER The major operation . ( A second 's pause . He starts toward her , appeal in his eyes , in his voice. ) p. 145 DR . AXTON TALLEY Enid ENID FULLER ( Unwilling to have her emotion for him stirred up again at this moment . She has been through enough for one day ) Good night , AXTON . ( A moment longer  --  their eyes meet . She turns and goes out , a little blindly . He takes a step after her , her name on his lips . ) DR . AXTON TALLEY ( Though she is gone , to himself ) Enid Enid ( But she is gone . He is alone . He stands , rooted , thinking . How has this happened to him ? He feels himself suddenly spent , nerveless . He is overcome by a feeling of despair and , what is more unexpected for him , fear , a fear of loneliness , a fear of the future , that he has never felt before . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize this fear , to wrestle with it , to overcome it . He can not . He feels it overcoming him . He stares at the floor , his fists clench . The curtain comes down. )
