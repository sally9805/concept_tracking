In Chicago 's swank Fourth Presbyterian Church this Easter , worshipers will hear music by Composers Cesar Franck , the late Sergei Rachmaninoff and Sir Edward Bairstow , a widely-recognized English contemporary . <P> In little Martensdale , Iowa ( pop . 172 ) , worshipers at St. Paul 's Lutheran Church ( membership : 170 ) will hear ten farm boys &; girls and the local hardware merchant sing such stirring old favorites as Christ , the Lord , Is Risen Today and Jesus Lives ! <P> The difference between these two Easter programs is a striking illustration of what is going on throughout the U.S. in church music . For the past decade , music directors and organists of big city parishes have been vigorously campaigning to throw out the oldtime Victorian anthems and Gospel hymns and substitute the works of the so-called " pure classicists " like Bach , Palestrina , Victoria and the modern imitators of their polyphonic styles . Most ministers and congregations are either indifferent or hostile to change . Volunteer smalltown choirs , unopposed by professionals , are still enthusiastically flatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in Manhattan-hotbed of the classicist movement-one of the two old hymns that Martensdale will sing will also be heard in 70% of the big city 's churches this Easter . <P> Main reason the ardent purists have not been more successful is that congregations like to sing . Listening to Palestrina , however purely performed , is not the same thing at all . Many a churchgoer has come to feel that the service is already less for the congregation than for the choir , and he resents any fresh attempts to turn his place of worship into what is beginning to look like a mere concert hall . <P> Prime mover of the drive for classical church music is cherubic , inexhaustible Dr. Clarence Dickinson , 71 , director of the School of Sacred Music at Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary . He has written or arranged some 500 anthems and chorales , edits the standard Presbyterian Hymnal , has trained some 300 U.S. church music directors . Now , as chairman of the American Guild of Organists ' service committee , he spends his spare time telling organists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music instead of merely " decorating " them with " soul-saving hymns . " Dr. Dickinson pours most of his philosophy into one anecdote : " Once I heard a preacher sermonize on Launch into the Deep . Then the choir stood up and sang Pull for the Shore . You see , it 's better to plan your service . "
