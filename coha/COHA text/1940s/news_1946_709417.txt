txt Poland and France Join Her in Minority Opinion , Holding Iran Question a Dispute Experts ' report on , Lie 's opinion in Iran case , Page 15 . The Security Council 's Committee of Experts voted 8 to 3 yesterday that the Council had the right to keep a dispute on its agenda even if the parties to the dispute asked them to drop it . This deciSion virtually assured that the Council would retain jurisdiction over the Iranian case until May 6 , despite the fact that both Iran and the Soviet Union have asked that it be dropped . The Iranian case will come up again on Tuesday afternoon when the Council holds its next meeting . At the end of two days of debate on Secretary General Trygve Lie 's legal opinion that the Council might not have authority to continue dealing with the Iranian case after Moscow and Teheran asked them to take it off the agenda , the Committee of Experts issued a report stating that they had not been able to formulate a common policy on Mr. Lie 's memorandum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that the Soviet Union , France and Poland had sided with Mr. Lie 's indications that he thought the Council did not have authority under the United Nations Charter to deal with the question after the Russo-Iranian decision to drop it , and that the eight other members of the Council insisted that the Council could  --  and probably would ? continue to keep Iran on its agenda until the Red Army went home . The Committee of Experts was brought into the Iranian case Tuesday when Mr. Lie handed a memorandum to Dr. Quo Tai-chi , then President of the Council . This memorandum suggested that since both Iran and the Soviet Union had asked that the case be removed from the agenda , it was " arguable " that the question was automatically removed from the agenda unless the Security Council took certain specific acts . Mr. Lie explained that , in his view , the Council might not be able to retain jurisdiction unless it ordered an investigation in the case under Article 34 , or charged that there was a threat to international peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute " or " situation " to be settled . The report of the Committee of Experts agreed on only one substantive point raised by Mr. Lie ? they agreed " in principle " that before the case could be taken off the agenda , the Security Council had to act to do so . The delegates of the Soviet Union , France and Poland , however , argued that a " dispute " is usually a conflict between two states and that if the states that are parties to that dispute reach an agreement Aid ask the . Council to drop the case , " the Security Council is bound to do so . " The eight other members of the Council disagreed both with the three powers and with Mr. Lie on this question , however . These eight included the United States , Britain and China , whose Dr. Yuen-li Liang was formerly head of the committee and played an importa .. A part in writing the majority opinion . They criticized Mr. Lie for arguing the case on too narrow a basis and for having an inexact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority opinion observed that the Security Council was not a court of justice , in which the parties to a dispute could merely settle a case out of court . The council received under the Charter certain major political functibns , the first of which was to act for all members of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security , the opinion said . The Soviet delegation  --  supported by France and Poland  --  drew a distinction between the rules that should govern a " dispute " and those that should govern a " situation . " A. " dispute , " they argued , was one that exists " only by virtue of the opposition between interested parties , " whereas a " situation " is one in which many States may be concerned . " It is in conformity with coni- ' mon sense , logic and law , " the minority contended , " to affirm that if all parties to a dispute have reached an agreement , the threat to the maintenance of peace from the prolongation of such a dispute thereby disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrpment after negotiations , which they have undertaken , either voluntarily or in fulfillment of a recommendation made by the Security Council in accordance with Article 33 of the Charter , and if they ask the Security Council to drop the dispute in question , the Security Council is bound to do so , after having noted that theft agreement has put an end to the dispute . " One interesting sidelight of this reasoning is that it amounts to an admission in the Iranian case that this is a " dispute " and under the terms of the Charter  --  should the debate on Iran be prolonged  --  the parties to the dispute would not have a vote on pacific settlements of the dispute . The net effect of the debate over the powers of the Security Council seems merely to be that the decision to retain jurisdiction over the Iranian case has been delayed . It will come up on Tuesday before the Spanish question , and the majority of the Council is likely to vote with the United States and Britain in favor of retaining jurisdiction until May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out .
