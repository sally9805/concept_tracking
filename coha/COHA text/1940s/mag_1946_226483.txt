Good morning without cigaret tzan-tzantza ganga bouzbouc zdouc scars laziness of sparkling lights . . . his belly is a , big box for there are zigzags on his soul and a lot of rrrrrrrrr . . . . <P> That 's the way Radio Paris started its midnight program . The long-haired doubletalk-Dada love poetry and surrealist verse by Tristan Tzara , Andr Breton , Paul Eluard , Salvador Dali and Louis Aragon-went on for 15 minutes . <P> Drop everything , drop Dada , drop your wife , your mistress . Drop your hopes and your fears . Sow your children in a corner of the woods . Drop your prey for the shadow . . . . <P> Alternating between jungle staccato and mellifluous French , three men and two women described a Dali dream : <P> A vast and desolate landscape . The convulsive and catastrophic shapes of the rocks will give a frozen notion of geological delirium . A silver spoon ten meters long will sprout directly from a rock of iron . Inside the spoon . . . two fried eggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the white of the eggs and the silver spoon will reflect the light of the sky . . . very precisely aquamarine . <P> All five actors pitched their voices to simulate the sound of a crowd , jabbering violently . <P> Detach my blue brain . Give me drinking water . Look out for the ' mountains . Think of arsenic . Change the yellow ink . Remember last year . Remember the heat . We spit in the air and the nightingales spit on us . <P> Mad , uncontrolled laughter ended in a hysterical shriek . <P> The ash is the cigar 's sickness ... a gas inspector is like an insect on a salad . . . . Your wife " will have hair as white as sugar and her ears will be unpaid bills - unpaid because you are dead ! <P> Toward the end of the program , hot jazz records and a tom-tom battery of sound effects gave way to a note of love . <P> It is always the same vow , same youth , same pure eyes , same caress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . The cards said I will meet her , but without recognizing her . Loving love ... 150 castles where we were going to love were not enough for me . I will have 100,000 more built tomorrow . ( Woman 's voice . gradually fading : Mon amour , mon amour , mon amour , mon amour . ) <P> Last week Jean Langlois , who wrote the show , said there had been no listener reaction , as yet .
