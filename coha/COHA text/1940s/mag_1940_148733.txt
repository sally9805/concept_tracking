Into the Detroit smithy of Wagon-maker August Charles Fruehauf ( rhymes with blew-off ) one day in 1915 walked a lumber dealer . To the blacksmith he posed a problem : Could he make a two-wheel cart to hitch behind a truck , haul lumber from yard to job ? August thought he could . In no time his two-wheelers were delivering lumber all over Detroit , and a brand-new U. S. industry was born : the commercial trailer . <P> Not until Depression I did highway hauling come into its own . By that time the trailer had become an adjunct to the inter-city truck . For , as a horse can pull more than it can carry , so a trailer pulled by a motor in a cab can outhaul a truck . <P> Because trailer-making is a very specialized industry with different problems for each type of goods to be hauled , Fruehauf earned a ride behind the cab of the zooming motortruck industry , became the Fisher of highway hauling . Building some 30 standardized types from two to 50 tons ( priced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry 's technological pace , makes 40% of all U. S. commercial trailers today . <P> A full lap ahead of competitors , Fruehauf sales last year were $14,878,641 , up 126% over 1938 . Net was a record $1,829,041 . Last week , with their 25-acre Detroit plant newly expanded , Fruehauf officials waited patiently for the concrete floors of a big new Los Angeles plant to harden . With first-quarter sales an estimated 50% ahead of last year , they needed the extra production facilities . <P> Fortnight ago ( to get more working capital , pay off a $1,306,000 debenture issue ) they offered a $4,000,000 convertible preferred stock issue to the public through a Wall Street syndicate headed by Lehman Bros . The public ate it up in less than 90 minutes . <P> Reason for Fruehauf 's 1939 earnings record was twofold : 1 ) biggest year ever for U. S. truck loadings ; 2 ) installation last year of modern automotive production-line methods in the Detroit plant . <P> But it was also attributable to the smart , smooth-working executive combination of President Harvey Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard , 43 , in charge of manufacturing , and Roy August , 31 , director of sales-sons of August who made the two-wheel cart . <P> Tractor-trailers do almost 100% of all U. S. inter-city highway hauling today . A few months ago the Fruehauf brothers got the job of national distributor for the stainless steel trailers of Budd Manufacturing Co. , gave an initial order for 10,000 stainless steel semitrailer body sets . On the market and doing nicely is Fruehauf 's new light-weight Aerovan ( of aluminum alloy ) which , carrying a ten-ton payload , weighs three-quarters of a ton less than Fruehauf 's equivalent steel model of last year . One growing reason for reducing trailer weights : many a local highway regulation restricts them .
