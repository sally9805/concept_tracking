The big fight had " gone across the river " to Jersey . In one corner last week , black-browed and confident , sat Rocky Graziano , onetime Army deserter , middleweight champion and boxing 's worst foot forward ( he is barred in New York and in Illinois ) . The boys in the ringside seats noticed the pimples on his back and recalled stories that 26-year-old Rocky had been eating high off the hog since people began calling him " champ . " <P> Across the ring squatted elderly ( 34 ) , impassive Tony Zale , an old foe . They had put on two spine-tingling battles before . Each had knocked out the other once and this was the rubber match . At the bell , Zale advanced stealthily , pawed at Rocky 's scowling face like a cat in a tentative mood . Then Zale 's left hook exploded on Rocky 's jaw . It was a stunner : Rocky 's eyes widened and his knees wobbled . With the fight only 30 seconds old , the crowd surged to its feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the first round ( in which Zale knocked him sprawling with another left ) , bewildered Rocky was dazed and bleeding . Through the second round , Rocky snarled savagely , but it was the snarl of a wounded animal . At 1:08 of the third round , Zale landed the knockout blow , another sizzling left . Rocky fell flat on his back and lay very still . <P> Zale , a champion once more and richer by $60,000 ( Graziano 's share of the purse : $120,000 ) , went back to his dressing room , put in his store-teeth , and announced that he would fight any challenger-anyone , that is , but Roughhouse Rocky , whose one &; only claim to glory , the power of his fists , had failed him .
