His death in the hospital brought British police casualties to six killed and five injured as a result of terrorist action since yesterday . The 45-year-old acting chief of , Haifa 's Criminal Investigation Department was responsible for the handling of inquiries into political extremist activity . An official version of the shooting said he had parked his car in la garage and was standing outside ' waiting for a friend when a taxicab cruised past from which four shots were fired . An army officer , escorted by two soldiers , who was traveling behind the taxi , ordered the soldiers to ' open fire . The taxi crashed into a traffic barrier and two men wearing khaki shirts and shorts Ijumped out . They escaped on foot . ln the taxi the police found a suitlease with one grenade , one tommyOn ; two ammunition magazines and one pistol . This latest terrorist . ct is causing most persons here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic measures will be imposed ' upon Palestine 's 600,000 Jews . The Imam in the street believes that such measures are inevitable , especially as no inkling of the intentions of the British administrations has emerged since Tuesday 's blasting of the Egypt-Palestine train and Yesterday 's blowing up of British police barracks at Sarona , near Tel Aviv . Tomorrow four of Palestine 's // seven Hebrew morning papers will publish speeches and articles by . leading Zionists attacking political terrorism . This is part of the Jewish Agency 's campaign against the " dissident " underground , timed on the eve of the United Nations special General Assembly session to discuss preliminary aspects of the Palistine question . Each of the newspapers will devote one whole inside page of its four-page issue to anti-terrorist material . This will include speeches by David Ben-Gurion , chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency . It is believed that the decision to initiate " education in anti-teror-I ism " in advance of the United Nations General Assembly session was reached at Wednesday afternoon 's meeting of the Jewish Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gen. Sir Alan G. Cunningham , the High Commissioner for Palestine . It is considered probable that conveyance of the decision to Sir Henry Gurney , Palestine Chief Secretary , by Mrs. Golda Meyerson , Zionist political chief , may explain the delay of the Palestine British authorities in imposing severe measures . It is thought that the British wish to observe the outcome of the agency 's campaign of education . Hijackers Being Resisted The fact that ordinary persons are becoming progressively hostile over terrorist outbursts is indicated by a report about a Tel Aviv taxidriver who resisted an attempt to hijack his taxi . Today 's police blotter tells how a girl of about 18 years hired him yesterday and told him to go to another section of the town . On arriving there two armed men appeared and ordered him to leave , as his taxi was required by the Irgun Zvai Leumi . The driver refused and one man hit him on the head with a revolver butt . A crowd gathered , however , and the hijackers ran away . Numerous cases of this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer constantly . When their vehicles are found abondoned after outbreaks it takes days before the police authorities release them pending investigations . This cuts into their livelihood . So they are now beginning to resist . British Army signalmen were ; reported to have begun installing ; telephones in Hilltop Castle , built ' by the late former Kaiser Wilhelm ' in 1897 . This is believed to be preparatory to British Army headquarters in Palestine moving ! there . The castle , known as Augusta Viktoria Kaiserinhof ; was built by ' the former Kaiser as a gift to his first wife after he visited Jerusalem at the end of the last century . Later it became a monastery . It Was used as the High Commissioner 's residence from 1920 until 1927 , when it was damaged by an earthquake . During the recent war it served as a military hospital . Army headquarters occupies the top floor of the six-story King David Hotel . Most of the hotel is occupied by Government offices .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
