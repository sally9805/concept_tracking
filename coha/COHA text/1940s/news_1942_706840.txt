txt WASHINGTON , Nov. 14 ? With filibuster tactics against the poll tax repeal bill turning on the second day from sustained oratory to absenteeism which prevented a quorum , the Senate ordered the arrest of eight of its missing members , six of them from Southern poll-tax States . This drastic action , taken for the first time since the conflict over Boulder Dam in May , 1928 , was directed on motion of Senator Barkley of Kentucky , the majority leader , to instruct Vice President Wallace to sign the warrants . Senator of Tennessee was actually arrested by a deputy sergeant at arms after a maid unlocked a door of his suite at the Mayflower Hotel . Senators Maybank of South Carolina and Bunker of Nevada were put under " technical " arrest . Mr. Maybank , reached at his home by telephone , accepted a ride to the Capitol in an automobile sent for him . Mr. Bunker walked into the chamber while he was being sought elsewhere . Five Warrants Outstanding When the debate got under way , three hours and forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warrants were still out for five others , including Senator Hill of Alabama , the majority whip , whose job it is to round up Democratic absentees , Senators Doxey of Mississippi , O'Daniel of Texas , Russell of Georgia and Overton of Louisiana . As Senator Bilbo of Mississippi resumed the debate which he began yesterday afternoon , he denounced the press , radio and other channels for distributing news suggesting that a filibuster was in progress . He predicted that consideration of this legislation would continue until Jan. 3 , when the present Congress expires and the new one takes over . From the outset of the day 's session Senator Barkley kept at the task of getting a quorum . When only twenty-six members responded to the first calling of the roll , a call for absentees was ordered . When only five more members appeared , , Mr. Barkley moved that the sergeant at arms , Chesley W. Jurney , be directed to inform absent members that their presence was wanted in the chamber . Thirteen members entered , but the Senate still lacked five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President be directed to issue warrants for the arrest of the eight still missing members who , he had been informed , were in the city . The warrants , " commanding " the sergeant at arms " forthwith to arrest and take into custody and // ARRESTS COMPEL SENATE QUORUM // bring to the bar of the Senate " the designated members who were " absent without leave , " were turned over to Mr. Jurney . Finding doors locked at the offices of missing Senators , Mr. Jurney deputized John J. Kearney , custodian of the Senate Office Building , to unlock them with his master key . While this fruitless search was going on , Senator Herring of Iowa and Senator Aiken of Vermont , who were not known to be in the city , and therefore had no warrants issued against them , appeared in the chamber . This left three members to be found to make a quorum of forty-nine . Then Mr. Bunker came in , followed by Mr. Maybank . Neither believed himself to be under even technical arrest , but Mr. Jurney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Bilbo began speaking . New Start Now Required Throughout the actual session , which lasted until nearly 6 P. M. , no mention of the move to compel the presence of absentees was made . When the Senate adjourned tonight it wiped its slate clean , leaving nothing , not even Mr. Barkley 's motion to take up the poll tax repealer . Mr. Bilbo lost the floor , because also expiring with the adjournment was the appeal from a presiding officer 's decision yesterday that the measure was reported in regular order to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee . Mr. Barkley said that he would renew his motion to call up the bill when the Senate met on Monday , and Senator Pepper of Florida , author of the measure , joined him in declaring that the fight for it would not be dropped . Meanwhile , however , word was sent to forty-two members 9f the Senate who were known to be out of the city to be here on Monday . The oustanding warrants , it was said , were being held in abeyance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
