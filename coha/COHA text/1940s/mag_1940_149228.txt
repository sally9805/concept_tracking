One of the gadflies that made official Washington miserable in World War I was the crackpot inventor , buzzing with mosquitoey ideas for winning the war-schemes for crashproof airplanes , inescapable torpedoes , mole-burrowing bombs . <P> Once in a thousand times such crackpottery held water . One day when a sentry in the Navy Department slipped away for lunch , an inventor slipped into Assistant Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt 's office , sold him an electrical antennae device that implemented the successful North Sea mine barrage . <P> Last week at a long mahogany table in Washington 's Commerce Department Building a group of scientists and engineers sat down for their first meeting . Appointed by Commerce Secretary Harry Hopkins , the National Inventors ' Council has only one reason for existence : to listen to all inventors , cracked or solid , tap them for soundness . Head of the council was one of the U. S. 's most famed industrial scientists , who has been known to have some queer ideas himself-horse-faced , talkative Charles Kettering , General Manager of Research Laboratories of General Motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . Around the table were nine others : Chrysler 's crack Engineer Fred M. Zeder , Du Font 's Research Director Fin Sparre , General Electric 's Research Laboratory Director William David Coolidge , Dean Frederick M. Feiker of George Washington University School of Engineering , Manhattan Patent Lawyer ( and Theatre Guild director ) Lawrence Langner , Ethyl Gasoline Corp . ' s Vice President Thomas Midgley , Director Watson Davis of Science Service , Engineering Dean Webster N. Jones of Carnegie Tech , U. S. Patent Commissioner Conway Coe . Absent from the first meeting were Industrialist George Baekeland ( Bakelite Corp. ) and Dr. Orville Wright , once rated a crackpot tried &; true . <P> Said Conway Coe when the council had finished organization , decided to meet again later : " We expect to get about 100,000 inventions a year . If ten of them prove to be useful . . . the idea will have been very much worthwhile . There 's no such thing as a crackpot inventor . Edison might have been the crackpot of the century . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
