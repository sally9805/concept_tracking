txt Collections in 3 Boroughs Now Top 72,000 Tons , With More Still Coming In Mayor La Guardia served notice yesterday upon the scrap metal dealers that they have only " a few days " left in which to demonstrate that they can move New York 's huge household scrap pile to the steel mills and processing plants without further delay . If they can not do the job , he said , the city will find other means of speeding its victory scrap heap , collected in a drive sponsored by the city 's newspapers ? which topped 72,000 tons , with the Bronx and Manhattan collections still to be made  --  to the steel-hungry war factories . The Mayor indicated that the alternative was direct handling of the city 's scrap metal by a Federal agency . He issued his ultimatum at La Guardia Field and repeated it later at City Hall , after returning from Washington , where8his conferences had included one with Paul Cabot , assistant to the director of the War Production Board 's conservation division . War Production Board officials are greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills in a hurry , the Mayor declared . Need for Steel Emphasized " We need steel . We need scrap , and we 're going to get it ! " the Mayor exclaimed several times . Asked whether he had taken up with Washington officials the issues that led Park Commissioner Robert Moses to resign as director of the city 's industrial scrap drive , the Mayor merely repeated his remark about needing steel . Referring to the city 's advertisements for bids on most of the household scrap that has been gathered so far , the Mayor said : " We 'll wait a few days , and if the junk dealers do n't take advantage of it , we will resort to other means . " When asked if the inference could be made that the household scrap might be handled by the Fed-1 eral government , Mr. La Guardia replied : " That 's right . " Donald Nelson , WPB chieftain , had said in Washington earlier in the week that if the waste industry could not handle the nation 's scrap metal victory piles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Mayor has been disturbed over the slowness with which the Queens scrap piles , amassed nine days ago , are being prepared for the mills . Junk dealers had bid on only a part of the 15,000 tons that the city originally offered for sale . Commissioner of Purchase Albert Pleydell , I who was with the Mayor during I the City Hall press interview , saidl that contracts for part of the Queens scrap have been let and the material is beginning to move . Bid in on Bronx Scrap On the brighter side , Commissioner Pleydell said he had received an " acceptable bid " for part of the scrap in the Bronx , which is to be collected from householders on Tuesday . The Mayor said that the offer of the city 's scrap dealers to pool their resources and make a joint effort at handling the metal might improve the situation . He said he would be glad to seek the Army 's aide in modifying the dimout regulations so that the salvage crews could work by night as well as day . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city cart the scrap to their yards in its own trucks the Mayor had only scorn . " Did you see the terms of the junk dealers ? " he asked . " Most of them are too funny to be taken seriously . They seem to want us to suspend selective service . We ca n't do that . " Pointing out that garbage had not been collected on the days the city used its trucks to pick up the scrap from sidewalks and neighborhood piles , the Mayor insisted that the city could not use its trucks to take the material from its salvage depots , where it is now stored , to the junkyards . " The dealers will have to provide private trucks , " he said . " We ca n't use city trucks every day . If they want to do business we 'll give them a chance . If not , we 'll find some other way for moving the scrap . " Total Exceeds 72,000 Tons Up to last night , household scrap metal collections in Brooklyn , Queens and Richmond had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's total would be because of uncertainty about how much will be collected this week in the Bronx and in Manhattan , where the ratio of apartment dwellers is much higher than in any of the other three boroughs . The Bronx pick-up will be Tuesday , and Manhattan 's on Thursday . William J. Powell , Assistant Sanitation Commissioner , in charge of the city collections , put it this way : " I admit these two boroughs have us fooled . Queens and Brooklyn have more detached houses , and these , of course , produce more scrap than apartments . On the other hand , the spirit of the people in the Bronx and Manhattan has been stirred by the records set in other boroughs and they will do their best to bring up their score . " The newspaper publishers scrap metal committee at City Hall made public the following borough figures , explaining that they consisted of the scrap metal picked up by city trucks and metal given previously by householders to organizations or sold to junkmen , for which receipts were turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31.6 pounds . Queens-42,367,947 pounds , for a per capita of 31.4 pounds . Richmond-15,706,730 pounds , for a per capita of 88.2 pounds . In Brooklyn , however , Borough President John Cashmore claimed a poundage of 87,104,564 for his borough . The difference , it was indicated at his office , was due to additional receipts turned in since Thursday by housewives for scrap they had sold or given to charities . Commissioner Powell said there would be no garbage collections in any part of the city Tuesday and Wednesday because the department 's trucks would be busy on the scrap drive . Wednesday will be tin can collection day , as usual . Manhattan 's 6,000 Boy Scouts will receive exact assignments , at troop meetings during the week , to the tasks they are to perform Thursday . The Girl Scouts , too , will aid in the two remaining borough pick-ups , as they did in Brooklyn , Queens and Richmond .. The motion-picture industry war activities committee announced that more than 1,000 independent and circuit theatres , in and about the city and in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap matinees " on Oct. 24 , at which the price of ad , mission would be a bundle of salvage material . Theatres will have the special showings earlier than their regular matinees and stagehands and projectionists will , with permission of their union , work the extra time without pay , the committee said . Unusual Items Scrapped Individuals , business concerns and organizations continued to turn in many unusual items for salvage . Some of the scrap in Manhattan and the Bronx is being sold by its owners to junk dealers so the proceeds may be applied to specific war relief or other funds . The poundage will be credited to the local salvage drive , as was done in similar cases in the other boroughs . A yachting cup , presented in 1902 by Kaiser Wilhelm II to the late Isaac Stern , first American yachtsman to win the international races at Kiel , Germany , was turned in to the American Women 's Voluntary Services salvage depot at 503 Park Avenue by Mr. Stern 's daughter-in-law , Mrs. Robert B. Stearns , a divisional A. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has collected more than a ton of metal , including several qutmoded X-ray machines , broken surgical instruments and bronze statues . The money realized by the sale of this scrap is to go to a fund for medical supplies for the Russian Army . Locks and dies more than 100 years old , found in the Crouch &; Fitzgerald luggage shop , went into a two-ton heap of scrap metal that the firm piled up in the main show window of its store at Madison Avenue and Forty-eighth Street . Some of the tools have been owned by the firm since it was started in 1839 . The pile will remain in the window until Thursday , when it is to be put on the sidewalk . A letter from Governor Lehman , praising the sacrifice of historic items for the scrap metal drive , was read at a ceremony in Larchmont , where Commodore Leroy Frantz of the Larchmont Yacht Club gave Mayor Harry E. Goeckler two large coast defense cannon and more than a dozen heavy iron cannon balls of Civil War days . Mayor Goeckler figuratively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the Larchmont scrap metal drive , although , he said , he did not know how the cannon would be moved . The weight of the cannon , which are of cast iron on steel carriages , was variously estimated from five to fifteen tons each . Commodore Frantz said they had graced the clubhouse lawn since 1901 , although no one could remember how they had got there . In his letter to the commodore , the Governor said that " the fact that the club is willing to sacrifice these historic pieces makes the I gift more inspiring . " After the speeches , a club member , H. T. Von Frankenberg , offered his 650-pound mushroom anchor and chain to the salvage pile . He said his yacht was on the ways for the Winter and that he would worry about an anchor next Spring . Several other yachtsmen followed Mr. Van Frankenberg 's example , and Mr. Burton soon had pledges of several tons of anchors and chains .                 @ @ @ @
