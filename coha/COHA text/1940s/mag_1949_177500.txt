The crackers sat in the sun , their backs to the decaying summer house and watched the strangers . Irwinton seemed full of strangers , their cars raising clouds of red Georgia dust . Said one resentfully : " We had a white man lay over in a swamp near Big Sandy Creek till the buzzards ate him up , and they found his bones . We did n't have a single newspaperman look at the bones . But seein ' as Picky Pie is a nigger he makes headlines . " Irwinton was reacting to 1949 's first lynching . <P> It all started Sunday night , when Sheriff George C. Hatcher was waked by a Negro . He was bleeding across the chest . " Picky Pie Hill done did me over at the New Harlem Club in Mclntyre , " he said . The sheriff jumped into his car and headed for the tin-roofed Negro juke joint four miles away . <P> Bare bulbs glared through the smoky , crowded room . Caleb ( " Picky Pie " ) Hill , a husky , 28-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him , and began to question witnesses . Suddenly , the sheriff felt his pistol pulled from the holster , turned to find Picky Pie aiming at his head . Hatcher ducked and the bullet went into the ceiling . In the scuffle , the sheriff 's pistol got lost . The sheriff took his prisoner back to town and put him in a cell with another Negro in the jail on the second floor of the sheriff 's house . Then he went back to get his pistol . It took him 2 hours . <P> The Door Was Open . The sheriff explained later : " The trouble was a report had got around that the Negro had killed me . The men were pretty riled up and when they did n't find me at home , they thought maybe I was dead . " <P> While he was gone , two men walked into the sheriff 's house . They had no trouble . The keys to the jail were on a cabinet in the living room , where the sheriff had left them , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock sticks , " explained the sheriff . The men calmly picked up the keys and went upstairs to the cell . " Come on , Picky Pie , let 's go , " one said . Without a protest , Picky Pie walked out with them . Mrs. Hatcher , asleep downstairs , heard no commotion . <P> Next morning two young farmers found Hill 's body , face downward in the sandy Georgia roadside , near Big Sandy Creek . He had been shot through the head and body . Roused , Sheriff Hatcher was amazed : " I thought , could it be they 'd come and got my prisoner ? I ran upstairs and sure enough , Hill was gone . " <P> No Memory . At the inquest , Tom Carswell , the Negro who had shared Hill 's cell , shook perceptibly as he was questioned . " They were white and there were two of them , " he said . Did he recognize them ? " I know just about everybody around here , but I never saw those two before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's town butcher , asked : " You probably could n't identify the men if you saw them again , could you ? " " No , suh , " said Carswell eagerly .
