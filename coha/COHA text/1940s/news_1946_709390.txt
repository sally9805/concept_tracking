txt Challenging proponents of the proposed $1,000,000 State Department of Commerce to find the funds needed to finance the project , Representative Roy C. Smith ( R ) of Holbrook . Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means , announced that Massachusetts faces a State deficit of $10,000,000 this year . As the hearing opened before the Ways arid Means Committee on the Governor 's recommendation for a State Department of Commerce , Representative Smith said his committee had been working on the budget for several weeks . Totaling $129,000,000 , the budget recommended by Governor Tobin far the next fiscal year is the largest on record . Addressing a group of businessmen and bankers , including Joseph P. Kennedy , former Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's and now Chairman of the Special Commission that originally recommended the Department Representative Smith said , " We are faced with a State tax of $10,000,000 . I hope you businessmen who are going to speak here today will tell us where the money is going to comp from . " Living Standard Sinking Massachusetts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the country , asserted Laurence F. Whittemore , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , who favored the proposed department . A resident of New Hampshire , Mr. Whittemore said that other States in New  --  England are taking more vigorous action than is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . Referring to the Department he said , " This will do no more than bring Massachusetts in line at least with northern States in comparison with the development of their industrial opportunities . Massachusetts should have a Department of Commerce . " Those responsible for defeating the proposal should explain why continuance of the present . situation " would not be distinctly discouraging to Massachusetts ' industrial future , " he said . Comparison Drawn " The amount of money asked , " he continued , " is comparatively not large . The wealth , population and , industrial importance of Massachusetts , compared to New Hampshire , is 12 to 1 . If the money expended for this purpose was at the same ratio , the MassachuFetts appropriation would be more than $1,500,000 . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More jobs , higher wages , greater productivity and a higher standard of living for the Commonwealth . " In answer to a question by Representative John E. Powers ( D ) of Boston , member of the Ways and Means Committee , Mr. Whittemore stated that he believed bankers of Massachusetts would vote nearly unanimously in favor of the Department . " The time has come for vigorous action , " he concluded . Massachusetts industry was divided over the question of how much good a Department of Commerce would dO . The Boston Chamber of Commerce , represented by Frank L. Tucker , favored it , but the Associated Industries of Massachusetts had this to say in a prepared statement : " Before any missionary efforts are expended in futile attempts to attract new industries to Massachtisetts it is absolutely essential that our public authorities acquaint themselves 1vith existing handicaps to industrial prosperity in this state and remove many of the present burdens now imposed on business activity , and attempts to make our Commonwealth a more profitable locality in which to operate . Too Many Statutes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business enterprise in this State over the past 30 years was intended to promote the welfare of our workers , In reality the policy pursued has merely-served to deprive some 250,000 former employees of their means of livelihood and now seriously threatens to eliminate entirely the re , maining industrial activity from the State . " The remedy , if any , for this alarming ? situation is solely in the hands of the Legislature . There is absolutely nothing that the proposed Department of Commerce can do about it other than to add another $1,000,000 a year to the excessive tax burden now resting upon our remaining , but ever dwindling , industrial economy . " - Tucker 's View Mr. Tucker asserted that a Department of Commerce will inject a business-minded point of view into our State Government , thus filling an important need in con- : nection with new legislation and the administration of present laws . " We believe the bill before this Committee today - is one of the most vital that has been presented for a long time , so far as the economic future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Postwar changes and competition are here . Companies , industries and , as we well know , whole States , are actively jockeying for a stronger economic position . We can not afford to let Massachusetts lag behind in this competition . " Without the incentive and protection that such an agency will provide , Massachusetts will certainly fall behind in the bitter sectional economic race that is now lunder way , " declared the Chamber spokesman . Politics Ruled Out . Representative John H. Carroll ( D ) of Boston . referring to the $18.000 a year director with a 10-year tenure , proposed for the Department . nuoted Governor Tobin . saying . " This is not a political issue. ? Representative Carroll also disclosed that 14 members of the 15-man Commission recommending the Department of Commerce signed the majority report . Only one man dissented and he attended only one meeting , the first one , said Mr. Carroll . Others expected to appear in favor of the proposal were Edward J.
