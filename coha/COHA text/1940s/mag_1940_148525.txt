In 1921 a Rochester . N. Y. , restaurateur named Harold H. Clapp found himself reduced to the unmanly position of nurse , cook &; bottlewasher for his two infant sons while their mother lay ill in the hospital . Unable to buy the special pureed vegetables and soups which a physician prescribed for his boys , he began straining his own vegetables , brewing Irs own soups . Manlike , he overproduced , ladled out his surplus to neighbors . Their hearty acceptance of his product led him to start a strained vegetable route . Within a year he had given up the restaurant business to found Harold H. Clapp , Inc. , pioneer U. S. baby-food maker . <P> By the time Founder Clapp sold his business to Johnson &; Johnson ( surgical dressings , Pharmaceuticals ) in 1931 , prepared baby-food was big business with a score of companies scrambling for it . <P> When American Home Products Corp . ( drugs , cosmetics , floor polish , etc. ) bought it from Johnson &; Johnson last year , the Clapp firm had a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to his fifth year . Packaged in four-and-a-half-ounce tins retailing at about 8 apiece , the cans of strained or chopped liver , lamb and beef complete with vegetables and vitamins left busy mothers little to do but make up dessert for Junior . <P> Two months ago even that effort was made easy . On the market appeared Clapp 's Rennet Desserts in six flavors ( vanilla , chocolate , lemon , orange , raspberry , maple ) . Price : 15 a package . Chief ingredients : sugar , calcium , salt , skim milk and rennet ( an enzyme from a calf 's fourth stomach ) . Children took to the new desserts , did not mistake them for spinach . Last week , because of its booming sales , Clapp broke ground for a new $250,000 addition to its model Rochester plant-a 50% increase in floor space . <P> For handsome , athletic Henry Wisdom ( " Tex " ) Roden , who took over as president when Founder Clapp sold out , this growth was a triumph . Despite the competition of big firms such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McNeill &; Libby , Inc. , his firm claims 25% of the industry 's yearly $15,000,000 gross business , runs a dead heat with Heinz for first place . Some 35% of U. S. babies feed on prepared baby food . Fields as yet untapped ( aside from the rest of the infants ) are the stomach ailment trade and oldsters who may need a strained food line of their own .
