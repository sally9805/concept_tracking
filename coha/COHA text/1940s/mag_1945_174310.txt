When the doors ( of the ramshackle boxcars ) were opened , someone , I ca n't remember who , said we had reached Capas , a town in Tarlac province , and that we were headed for O'Donnell prison camp-named for the town of O'Donnell . . . . A seven-mile hike to O'Donnell prison was ahead of us . . . . My first good look at O'Donnell prison was from atop a rise about a mile off . I saw a forbidding maze of tumbledown buildings , barbed wire entanglements , and high guard towers , from which flew the Jap flag . I had flown over this dismal spot several times , but never had given it more than passing appraisal . I wondered as I looked at it now how long I would be there ; how long I could last . As we stood , staring dazedly , there came to me a premonition that hundreds about to enter O'Donnell prison this April day never would leave it alive. * <P> - Lieut . Colonel William E.
