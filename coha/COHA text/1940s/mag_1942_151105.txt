The New York Herald Tribune , a pretty good Republican itself , does not make a practice of biting other good Republicans . Last week it bit two : Clarence Budington Kelland and GOP Chairman Joseph Martin . <P> Mr. Kelland had just got a new job . Joe Martin had appointed him GOPublicity Chief , to replace Franklyn Waltman . Best known as a highly paid writer of commercial fiction , wry-faced " Bud " Kelland is a hardshell , old-style GOPman who once cracked : " The fifth column in this country is headed by that fellow in the White House . " <P> He was also , when there were such things as isolationists , a veritable monadnock . <P> Among U.S. citizens who learned of the appointment by reading the news in the paper was the nation 's foremost Republican , Wendell Willkie . Among those who thought the appointment a bad one was the Herald Tribune . When Bud Kelland , making his first pronouncement as a GOPundit , declared that it was every citizen 's bounden duty , even in wartime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune let out a growl and jumped for him . <P> " Mr. Kelland was so busy being a Republican in the last year , " the Herald Tribune snarled , " that he could not seem to get excited about the German menace or the Japanese menace or any other national issue . While Mr. Willkie was pleading for a truce in politics with respect to foreign affairs , Mr. Kelland was kicking the Administration in the shins . . . . Now he is out pleading for politics and more politics . He does not say criticism . . . but politics . Perhaps a wronger choice could have been made by Mr. Martin . But we ca n't think just how . . . . The Republican Party has faced a lot of hard luck in its day , but Mr. Kelland is just too much . . . . "
