txt The truck - strike in New York City will be one week old tonight . As such strikes have had a way of doing in the past , this one has been growing worse instead of better . It is earnestly to be hoped that the three-man mediation panel which is to meet today can produce some results . We have had painful evidence in the past of the disastrous effect these strikes have on business and the earning of a livelihood . Mayor O'Dwyer has stayed in the background of the present mediation effort , while studying the strike 's effect on essential supplies of food and drugs . He is a practiced hand at bringing together the parties at interest in a labor dispute . We assume he is watching closely for the right moment to intervene . An effort to achieve a truce . for two weeks while bargaining goes on would seem to be one method indicated , if no headway is made in the meeting today . A four-day truce was arranged in a similar truck strike several years ago , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing is plain , that we can not let this strike drift on merely because the parties seem discouragingly far apart on the issues . Too much time has already been allowed to elapse between direct negotiation sessions while the public suffers . This is a strike involving members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , AFL , whose president is Daniel J. Tobin . We should like to recall to Mr. Tobin and to his members some of the remarks he made two months ago which seem to bear in principle on the current controversy . Taking the theme " Blunder of One Union Hurts All , " Mr. Tobin , writing in the International Teamster , remarked in part : " When a large industry is tied up by a strike which paralyzes the nation , it affects many other labor unions . Even though the labor union on strike may feel justified , the effects of its action are not confined to itself . For instance , in a coal strike which paralyzes the nation after thirty days , thousands of teamsters can be involved as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other large manufacturing and transportation trades . " What Mr. Tobin ' was saying as to the effect of a coal or railroad strike on the workers of the nation is exactly applicable on a lesser but still substantial scale to the effect of a truck strike on the workers of this city of 8,000,000 and its populous near-by area . In a confidential letter to his locals Mr. Tobin in early June advised union officers " to impress upon our general membership that no matter how difficult the road may be , keep your men at work and stop strikes during the coming year . " He advocated arbitration as the best way to resolve , differences with employers and advised against the calling of injudicious strikes or making excessive demands . This was excellent advice . Perhaps Mr. Tobin would feel it desirable to suggest a return to work and moderation of demands by the local , which has , in this area , repeatedly used the blunderbuss of the strike method with a damaging effect on hundreds of thousands of workers who were in the hapless position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
