The 300th meeting of the Security Council last week may well have stirred envy in the narrow breast of " Evil-Eye " Fleegle . As readers of Cartoonist Al Capp 's Li'L Abner know , Fleegle , a saturnine resident of Brooklyn , has eyes of compelling power . Mother Nature , in a misguided moment , endowed him with the ability to transmit visual whammies . A single whammy can stop a policeman in his tracks . Slightly stronger whammies will tame a gorilla or stun a herd of oxen . Rarely , only rarely , does Fleegle loose the lightning bolt of a double whammy , which is powerful enough to heat a city the size of Wilkes-Barre , Pa . <P> Last week at Lake Success , Dr. Jan Papanek , former Czech delegate to the U.N. , told how the Russians were pressuring his country . All Czech envoys , " including the Ambassador to Washington , " must make daily reports to the Soviet embassies , he declared , and every Czech ambassador must be " screened " by Moscow . Russia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges as " sheer libel . " When it was moved that the Council set up a subcommittee to investigate Russian pressures at the time of the Czech coup itself , Gromyko countered by threatening a double veto . <P> The Council knew what that meant . During his 26-month tenure as Soviet delegate to the Security Council , Gromyko used the plain , ordinary , unadulterated veto 18 times . But only twice before did he unleash the full , blinding power of the double veto , which stops discussion before it can even get started . <P> Like the double whammy , the double veto has elements of the supernatural . It begins when Russia vetoes a resolution on which , in the opinion of the majority , the veto does not apply . This forces the Council to take a vote on whether the veto applies or not . On this vote , however , the veto does count and therefore all debate is automatically ended . <P> In Li'l Abner , Fleegle 's evil eye is usually thwarted by the overpowering goodness of Mammy Yokum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been able to find an antidote for the Russian basilisk . This week , true to his promise , Gromyko double-vetoed the motion on Czechoslovakia .
