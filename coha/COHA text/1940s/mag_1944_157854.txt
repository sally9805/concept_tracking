For Eamon de Valera , Eire 's election was a personal triumph and a bright green light . Tired of trying to rule with a minority in the Dail ( House of Commons ) , he had astutely seized the opportunity offered three weeks ago by an otherwise unimportant defeat ( TiME , May 22 ) , asked the people for a solid majority . Last week he got what he wanted . <P> When the counting ended , the Taoiseach ( Gaelic for Prime Minister ; pronounced tee shock ) and his Fianna Fail had a clear margin of 14 seats in the Dail instead of a deficit of four . Even if all other parties voted solidly against him , De Valera could win on any foreseeable issue . Now he had what he had demanded : power to match his responsibility . <P> The campaign was not up to the Irish mark . Homebound by Eire 's shortage of petrol , candidates hardly bothered to take their coats off . Newspapers predicted apathy at the polls . A few days before the election , Dubliners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease than in politics . But the Irish misjudged the Irish . On election day some 65% of the eligible voters managed to get to the polls-by donkey cart , shanks ' mare , even horse-drawn mourning coaches . <P> , For this popular interest , and for his majority , De Valera had the U.S. Government to thank . Its recent pressure , reluctantly seconded by Britain , against Eire 's neutrality had simply made Eire 's Irishmen more devoted to their own belligerent neutrality than ever . Eamon de Valera symbolized neutrality and Eire 's independence , hauled in the votes when the test came .
