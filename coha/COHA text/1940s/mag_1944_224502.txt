The Explosion <P> Sirs : <P> Words can not express the contempt with which I read the remarks made by Senator " Cotton Ed " Smith regarding our Commander in Chief in your article " Explosion in the Senate " TIME , Dec. 20 . . . . <P> It will be up to history to decide who has done more for his country and for mankind : Franklin D. Roosevelt . . . whose name is linked with freedom , democracy and humanity ... or Cotton Ed Smith who wastes the time of his people by insulting their President . . . . <P> STEPHEN L. SABORSKY <P> Lieutenant , M.A.C . <P> Camp Claiborne , La . <P> Sirs : <P> As an officer in the Army of the U.S. , I am thankful that this country does tolerate remarks from all persons . . . . <P> But to think that a U.S. Senator would cause to be entered such remarks as those uttered by " Cotton Ed " Smith in the Congressional Record ! We are in the midst of an Orientation Program but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do they let a man so bitterly against the Administration and openly agreeable to lynching carry on as a Senator ? " Yes , I go overseas soon but what a memory of Congress I have . . . . <P> ( SERVICEMAN 'S NAME WITHHELD ) <P> Newport News , Va . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Your presentation of the backyard internecine squabbling among New Deal and Southern Democrats is plain disgusting . . . . <P> Surely your vast and literate reading public has more to think about than the feudalistic , reactionary statements of a few Southern Senators . While American troops are fighting for an equivalent world of four freedoms , certain Southern statesmen wage a ceaseless battle for their world of poll taxes , racial intolerance , lynchings and indiscriminate mockery of the Chief Executive . Why do n't the Southern Senators secede from their party ? If they did , at least they would no longer stigmatize the remaining Democrats with their cant , spurious oratory and hypocrisy . <P> DAVID L. SUTHERLAND <P> Corry , Pa . <P> &gt;TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes readers will continue to find them food for thought . &shy; ED . <P> How to Clean Paint <P> Sirs : <P> To either TIME 'S Army &; Navy editors and their researchers ... or to their " baldheaded SPARS squeegeeing paint " ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) a couple of clean rags , a bucket of " soujge " and another of fresh water to clean their paint-work . <P> Second thought is that TIME 'S harbor-hopping correspondent might need one large earhorn . <P> J. J. SULLIVAN , U.S.N.R. <P> Lieutenant ( j.g . ) <P> Peru , Ind . <P> &gt; Let an earhorn be ordered . The word is indeed " soujge " ( variously spelled-meaning a cleaning solution ) . &shy; ED . <P> Warning <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , Dec. 13 , under Production , states , " The American production war has been 4 TIME , JANUARY 10 1944 won . " I am concerned lest the average reader receive entirely too rosy an impression from a casual reading of that article . <P> To those of us responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , it is still a frequent and heartbreaking experience to see them sail lacking many items which may be vital to the successful accomplishment of their mission ...
