This week the conscience of U.S. science , in the person of a chunky Chicago physiologist named Andrew Conway Ivy , took off for Nu " rnberg . He is to represent U.S. scientists at the trial of 23 Nazi doctors for high crimes against Science-and against Humanity . <P> The U.S. could hardly have chosen better . From his scrubby grey mustache to his trotting gait , Dr. Ivy is as American as baseball . <P> He was born in Farmington , Mo. , was educated at a Missouri normal school , the University of Chicago , Rush Medical College , made his college wrestling team and Phi Beta Kappa . Like many another successful medico , he is part researcher , part executive , part salesman . <P> At the University of Illinois , where he works , he supports the back-breaking title of Vice President in Charge of Chicago Professional Colleges and Distinguished Professor of Physiology . He has a homely , unpretentious philosophy : " To make a comfortable living $18,000 a year while making living comfortable for other people . " <P> Fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation 's top physiqlogists . He is an expert on stomach ulcers ( TIME , April 28 , 1941 ) , aviation medicine ( TIME , Oct. 6 , 1941 ) , cancer ( TIME , Dec. 16 , 1946 ) , analgesia ( pain killers ) , gall-bladder and liver complaints , diseases of old age . His proudest achievement : discovery of a hormone which he thinks shows promise as a stomach-ulcer cure ( the hormone : enterogastrone , extracted from hog intestines ) . <P> When Ivy transferred to the University of Illinois from Northwestern last fall , he insisted on freedom to putter in his laboratory . At Illinois , he is working ( with 20 research assistants ) on at least a dozen projects , including a " physical environment " laboratory to study effects of cold and high altitude , an institute on the diseases of old age , research on the kidney , on electrical treatment of infantile paralysis . <P> But to Andrew Ivy , medicine is partly " missionary " work . Much of this work is done in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago ( he was a medical consultant to both the Army and Navy during the war ) . He has big plans for national cancer research , has pestered capital politicos for a good many months to put up the money . With his great &; good friend , the University of Chicago 's world-famed physiologist Anton J. ( " Ajax " ) Carlson , he has for years fought a determined battle against anti-vivisectionists . <P> Man at Work . Though Ivy once announced , in a learned paper on The Physiology of Work , that " one day 's rest in seven is essential , " he himself works seven days a week , 12 to 16 hours a day . He rises at 6 , is at work by 7:30 ( he drives so fast that Chicago police have lost count of the number of times they have stopped him ) .
