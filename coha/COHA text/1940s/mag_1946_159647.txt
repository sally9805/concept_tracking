Lean and leisurely John Tinney McCutcheon was crowding his deadline . His mind and drawing board were blank , and the bulldog edition over at the Chicago Tribune would wait just so long . Outside his studio window , there was a promise of fall in the hazy September air . He fell to daydreaming . . . on such a smoky afternoon , back home in Indiana , a boy might gaze at a cornfield studded with tattered golden shocks , and see them turn into Indian tepees . Idly he began to sketch . When the Tribune messenger arrived , he had finished his greatest cartoon . That was 39 years ago . <P> Last week , as gaunt old John T. McCutcheon rounded out his 76th year and laid aside his crayons for good , his Injun Summer was still the most popular cartoon that ever came out of the Midwest . In recent years his crosshatched , mild- &-mellow; drawings , fussy and cluttered-up by modern standards , have all but vanished from Colonel Robert R. McCormick 's isolationist , Anglophobic pages . McCutcheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human kindness , and one-eyed Carey Orr 's vitriol is more to the Colonel 's taste . McCutcheon , in failing health , did not mind the eclipse ; his kind of cartooning had brought him fun and fame , a Pulitzer Prize ( 1931 ) and a good living ( around $50,000 a year ) . <P> Hoosier Hooky . The dean of U.S. cartoonists was a Tippecanoe County farm boy . He went to Purdue ( class of ' 89 ) with two other famous Hoosiers , Author Booth Tarkington and Humorist George Ade . A few years later , after Ade joined him on the staff of the old Chicago News , he pair played hooky to go sightseeing in Europe . Their boss astonished them by raying for the features ( stories by Ade , ketches by McCutcheon ) that they mailed home . <P> In 1898 McCutcheon took a round-the-trip , bumped into the Spanish War , was with Dewey at Manila Bay , moved on to sketch the Boer War for the folks jack home . Between junkets in 1903 , he switched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Teddy Roosevelt , covered both sides in World War I , always saw to it that his contracts called for long vacations . That gave him spare ime to write books , lend an encouraging land to youngsters like Milton ( Terry and the Pirates ) Caniff . <P> Gentle Cartoonist McCutcheon began thinking of calling it quits about the time Bertie McCormick began flogging the New Deal . Retiring now on a fat pension , he plans to loll on his own " Treasure Island " in the Bahamas , poke around the U.S. , edit a book of his cartoons . As he once cracked in an after-dinner speech : " I draw to a close , perhaps one of my most successful drawings . "
