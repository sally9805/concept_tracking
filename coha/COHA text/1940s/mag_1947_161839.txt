Last week 200 earnest characters met in Los Angeles for pregnant shoptalk about sterility . With straight scientific faces , the American Society for the Study of Sterility ( western branch ) sat down to consider the fact that one-seventh of all U.S. couples are childless , and why . When Paul Popenoe , director of Los Angeles ' American Institute of Family Relations , rose to speak , he nearly stopped the show . Said he : <P> " It must be remembered that half of all childlessness is voluntary . . . . Study of 8,370 completed families ( those in which the wife had passed the child-bearing age ) revealed that of the childless couples , 59% were happy ; of the parents of three or more children , 71% were happy . It is clear that happiness increases with the number of children . . . . Most couples who go into the divorce court are childless . No one can escape the conclusion that the divorced population represents to some extent a biologically inferior part of the population . " <P> As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a learned talk by U. C. L. A. 's Dr. Harry B. Friedgood . His thesis : the state of a woman 's nerves may have a good deal to do with whether she has children . <P> The nervous system , Dr. Friedgood explained , affects the pituitary and hypothalamus glands , which , in turn , control the production of sex hormones . Hence a neurosis may well upset hormone production and produce sterility . <P> Women with deep emotional conflicts , Dr. Friedgood pointed out , often show psychosexual disorders . A fairly common one : false pregnancy among i ) unmarried women who feel guilty about illicit interr course , 2 ) wives who fear pregnancy , 3 ) older women who want children . <P> <P> In Manhattan , family matters came up again at a meeting of the American Social Hygiene Association . Summing up a 15-year study of the family system in the Western world , Dr. Carle C. Zimmerman , a Harvard sociology professor , drew a gloomy conclusion . The family system , he said , is likely to break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The family system ... of the ' classes ' is already badly gone . The next part . . . to break up will be that of the masses . Evidence indicates that our middle-class family system has reached its maximum demoralization . . . . The ethical content of recent middle-class family problem novels is really surprising . Even the superficial characters drawn by Ilka Chase are always ' crying in bed . ' <P> " Civilization will have to be sold on the aspirin level by Hucksters of Civilization , Inc. , a nonprofit , mass moral educational organization . "
