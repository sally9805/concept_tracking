In the south the Germans threw their greatest effort against a little swampy neck of land only four miles wide . They were determined to crack the Perekop Isthmus and overrun the Crimean Peninsula , no matter what the cost . <P> They did it , but the cost was high . <P> The Russians had choked the narrow isthmus with spots of defense as tightly as the Thousand Islands choke the St. Lawrence River . There was not much room for the channels of attack to flow through ; crossfire covered every channel . <P> But the attackers carried on a systematic nine-day aerial and artillery bombardment so concentrated that no defense in the world could remain intact . It was designed to blast a corridor just a few hundred yards wide . When the corridor was opened , troops poured through , and the battle changed , the Germans said , from assault to pursuit . The Germans drove south and east . <P> Eastward their objective was Kerch , at the extremity of the peninsula-a likely spot from which to bomb , and perhaps from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove on Simferopol , the Crimea 's capital , only 40 miles from the great port and naval base of Sevastopol . This week the German High Command announced the capture of the capital , and said that the Russians were retreating to both Kerch and Sevastopol , which they would presumably try to evacuate by sea . <P> The Crimea was cracked , but it had proved no Crete . Crete fell in twelve days . After more than a month , the Crimea was almost , but not quite , tuckered.
