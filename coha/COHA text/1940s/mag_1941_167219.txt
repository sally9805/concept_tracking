To succeed Coach Elmer Layden , who resigned to become the Judge Landis of professional football , the University of Notre Dame last week signed up 33-year-old Alumnus Frank Leahy , coach of Boston College 's undefeated 1940 football team . B. C. released Leahy from a five-year contract , at a salary reputedly higher than the one he will get from Notre Dame . Said Leahy , onetime lineman on the last two teams ( 1929-30 ) coached by the late great Knute Rockne : " I want to give them a chance to get back something they gave me. "
