Spartanburg , S.C . was torn between pride and embarrassment this autumn when a local boy named Thomas Eugene Atkins came home a hero . Few soldiers of World War II had fought more gallantly-with his hip shattered by a bullet , the rest of his platoon dead around him in the Luzon jungles , quiet , steady-eyed Pfc . Gene Atkins had kept " taking a sight " on Jap attackers , had killed 44 of them . He had been flown home on a bomber to meet the President and get the Congressional Medal of Honor . But when he got back to Spartanburg , the hero had to be viewed in exceedingly unheroic surroundings . <P> Home to Gene Atkins meant a wretched rural slum . His father was a sharecropper in the Hogback Mountain region , where tenant farms are rich only in ragged children , moonshine stills and Redbone hounds . The hero and his hill bride had little chance of escaping poverty . Broke , Gene Atkins was resigned to spend his $300 mustering-out pay for a stock-mule , harness , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wagon-and then sharecropping cotton on another man 's land . <P> A ruddy , gray-haired county doctor , A. R. Walden , thought that a hero should come home to something better . He wrote a letter , mailed it with $100 to the Spartanburg Herald-Journal : <P> " ... Editorials and medals are fine but they will not help greatly in earning a living after the heat of war is over . I would like to see Spartanburg County show this boy we appreciate what he has done by buying him a home of his own . " <P> Dollars , Half Dollars , Quarters . Publisher William A. Townes agreed . Next day the Herald-Journal suggested that its readers send contributions for a Thank You Farm for Gene Atkins . Spartanburg 's radio stations joined in the campaign . The response was wonderful . The Herald-Journal got few contributions for as much as $100 but thousands of dollars , half dollars , and quarters flooded in through the mail . In three weeks the people of Spartanburg County donated $7,500 . <P> Last week Thank You Farm-the 62-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Jackson 's store on the paved highway-was bought and it was almost ready for Gene Atkins and his young wife . <P> Two thousand dollars were still left in the fund , and lumber and materials for a house ( with electric lights and a bathroom ) were on order . Powell 's Furniture Store of Inman had promised to furnish the front room . The First Baptist Church of Landrum had donated a Bible , the Orange Crush Co. a mule , and other gifts were still coming in-an electric pump , fertilizer , pecan trees , dishes . <P> Government agencies were helping Gene plan to make his land a model farm . Secretary of Agriculture Clinton Anderson had agreed to come to the farm from Washington , D.C. for a dedication . <P> Everybody in Spartanburg County was certain that 24-year-old Gene Atkins would be a success and a great credit to the community . Wrote the ladies of the Cross Anchor Methodist Church : " It is men like you , Pfc . Atkins , that makes this America of ours the wonderful place it is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
