General MacArthur has said that " news is as necessary to the combat soldier as bread and bullets . " And I ca n't help feeling you will be proud to learn that TIME has been the leader in every single venture undertaken by any American magazine to get accurate , impartial news from home to our troops overseas in the shortest possible time . So this week I thought you might like to see the complete record : <P> TIME was the first magazine to invent a miniature " Pony " Edition for overseas distribution ( November 23 , 1942 ) . <P> TIME was the first to publish a special edition for our troops in Australia ( January 25 , 1943 ) ; the first to publish a special edition in Hawaii for our armed forces in the Central Pacific ( August 16 , 1943 ) . TIME was the first U.S. magazine to be published for our troops in Iran ( September 13 , 1943 ) ; the first to be published for our troops in the China-Burma-India theater ( November 22,1943 ) ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East ( January 24 , 1944 ) ; the first to print a Pony Edition in Honolulu for fast distribution to our armed forces in the Gilberts , the Marshalls and the South Pacific ( March 27 , 1944 ) . <P> TIME was the first to begin sending copies to all Army and Navy subscribers overseas by first class mail to reach them as quickly as their letters from home ( August 2 , ' 1943 ) . <P> TIME was also the first to make copies available for plane distribution to our troops in North Africa ( April 5 , 1943 ) , and the first to make copies available for large-scale distribution to our troops in England , thereby breaking a log jam and making it possible for the Army to distribute a number of other magazines in England . <P> And , of course , even before Pearl Harbor TIME started the world 's first plane-delivered magazine ( TIME Air Express for Latin America ) , thereby bringing our troops in the Canal Zone and all over the Caribbean many news-days closer to home . TIME was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to get the news faster to Mexico and Central America ) , in Bogot ( to get the news faster to Brazil and Uruguay ) , and in Buenos Aires ( to get the news faster to the Argentine ) . And a few months ago TIME , with its Scandinavian Edition printed in Stockholm , became the first magazine published inside the German blockade ( January 24 , 1944 ) . <P> The war has imposed almost unbelievable new burdens upon our correspondents , our editors , and our researchers . It has also made unprecedented demands on the resourcefulness and resolution of the men whose job it is to get TIME printed and distributed all over the world . It seems to me they have done a wonderful job . In any event , they have done a job which has won for your newsmagazine a truly unique position with our armed forces overseas . They have done such a good job that it seems to me only right that I should let you know about it .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
