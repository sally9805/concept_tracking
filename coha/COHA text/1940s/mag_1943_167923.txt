The Polish artist Feliks Topolski , whom George Bernard Shaw has called " perhaps the greatest of all impressionists in black &; white , " will shortly leave England for Gibraltar , Africa , Persia and India to continue drawing and painting the " entire phantasmagoria " of World War II . FORTUNE for January contains a ten-page portfolio of Topolski 's masterly impressions of U.S. troops in Britain and Northern Ireland . <P> Enraged by the massacre of his country , Topolski has lacerated Fascism with numerous brilliantly satirical cartoons . Where Goya fought sadism in war with purposely sadistic drawings of actual fighting , Topolski expresses total war through images of Russian peasants , London women and children bombed out of their homes , soldiers worn out after battle , firemen exhausted after days &; nights of blitz , crowds rushing for safety-pathetic rather than cruel facts of war . <P> Topolski 's art is in the tradition of the great draftsmen Daumier , Callot , Hogarth , his earlier work astoundingly like that of France 's Benjamin-Constant . Says Topolski : " My particular love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Descriptive Draftsmanship-which he believes to be perishing . <P> Born in Warsaw in 1907 , plump , humorous , brown-eyed Feliks Topolski studied at Warsaw 's Academy of Art , decorated <P> Warsaw nightclubs , while doing his military service in a Polish Cavalry Regiment designed his own uniform of pure white with gold braid and buttons . One night , while a guest in one of his self-decorated nightclubs , he was approached by a captain who had been instructed by a major at another table to ask Topolski what uniform he was wearing . Answered Topolski : " My own . " The major was amused and ordered Topolski to take it off . But the captain whispered that Topolski would not be court-martialed if he did not . Says Topolski : " I did n't . " <P> In 1935 a Polish magazine commissioned Topolski to draw the ceremonies of King George V 's Silver Jubilee . Topolski was so fascinated by such English institutions as pubs , the Derby and the Eton &; Harrow cricket match that he stayed on , published a book of satirical drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic support of famed British Painter Augustus Edwin John , London 's ultra-conservative Victoria &; Albert Museum purchased three Topolski drawings . Only one member of the Museum 's committee objected-on the ground that they were the work of a too young foreigner . The committeeman said : " We must draw the line somewhere . " Cracked Augustus John : " But can you draw the line like Topolski ? " <P> Bernard Shaw , who commissioned Topolski to illustrate three of his plays , remarked that Topolski " succeeds so admirably at what Picasso tries to do . When Feliks draws something it looks awkward until it is finished-when Picasso draws something it looks awkward after it is finished . " <P> When the Nazis bombed England , Topolski " wandered about gaping , secure in a curious self-imagined sense of being only a spectator behind the footlights . . . . " While he was sketching a Wren church in the middle of a night blitz , a huge bomb blew the church away , hurled Topolski to the ground . He was five weeks in the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss anything of the show . "
