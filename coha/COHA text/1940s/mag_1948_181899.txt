THE NAKED AND THE DEAD ( 721 pp. ) - Norman Mailer-Rinehart ( $4 ) . <P> A 25-year-old Harvard graduate who fought at Leyte has written perhaps the best novel yet about World War II . <P> It is distinguished primarily for simple realism , a forthright , almost childlike honesty , a command of ordinary speech , a cool and effortless narrative style , quickened here &; there with a mild , understated humor . The battle scenes are so vivid as to suggest Tolstoy 's War and Peace , the common soldiers as clearly visualized as Tolstoy 's peasants . Unlike Tolstoy 's masterpiece , it is all war , not only in the sense that there are no scenes of peaceful life poised against the scenes of war , but in the sense that a knowledge of the meaning of peace is absent from the psychology of the characters . They seem never to have known anything else . <P> War Without Dignity . It is all war , war on the Pacific island of Anopopei , which a force of 6,000 Americans is attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails through the jungle , war between Private Red Valsen and Sergeant Sam Croft-war without dignity and without purpose , war for position or prestige , war to save face , or to satisfy an inward sense of superiority , or war that is merely the psychological ricochet of the greater conflict off stage . <P> Even when the characters think back upon their own lives , or when the author condenses their experience in brief little biographies , the content of their doing is still war-war on the streets and at the parties , the wisecracks whining like rifle shots , the love affairs like ambushes . <P> The characters of The Naked and the Dead are the members of a platoon , six of them survivors of a rubber-boat disaster at Motome , wearied , embittered , haunted by a premonition of death , snarling about the newcomers and ( occasionally ) feeling a grudging responsibility for them , nervous , profane , lecherous . Their conversation is recorded with the fidelity of a recording machine . Indeed , it is almost too exact and too tough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pride in the platoon , not so much in the sense of liking the members of it , as of respect for what it has gone through . They have a mild pride in ( partly fear of ) a good officer , and a hesitant , partly exasperated approval of the democratic process that has placed them , Jews and anti-Semites , intellectuals and illiterates , in the same unearthly , uncomfortable place . They fight shy of any speechmaking about any of these things . Democracy is not a faith they fight for ; it is a sort of punishment they take for not having believed in it before . <P> The little group sets out on a mission as weird in its way as the quest of Ahab for the white whale . Hennessey is killed in the landing . The others take part in checking a Japanese assault across a narrow stream , get drunk , shoot prisoners , and prowl among the Japanese corpses for souvenirs . They are certain that their wives back home are unfaithful to them , from their own success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters from the States which arrive , telling them that all is over .
