To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> Dear Subscriber There is so much important , uncensored information in our files and on our desks these days that all last week we were busy being photographed and fingerprinted here at TIME-to make sure only people who belong here are admitted to our floors . <P> Although the fingerprinting was a new experience , it was just one of many the war has brought . For the people at TIME live so close to the news that they ca n't help feeling much of it as a personal experience-and so hardly a week goes by that they are not up to their ears in some new war interest or activity . <P> For example , very few of us had ever been blood donors until last spring , but now almost every one at TIME who is able has given one pint of blood to the Red Cross , and many two or three . <P> Every floor had its own tinfoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclamation day-almost a hundred of us have graduated from the First Aid classes we held five nights a week in our reception room-and the Treasury Department gave us its Certificate of Merit for the number of employees who signed up to buy bonds regularly in our own War Bond Drive . <P> So far two girls have left us to enlist ( one in the WAVES , the other in the WAACS ) and the plaque in our reception room shows that 173 TIME Inc. men are now in military service . <P> And this does not include the names of 14 other employees who resigned their jobs for the duration to do special work for the OFF , COI , Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and other government bureaus and agencies . Nor does it include correspondents Carl and Shelley Mydans , who were taken prisoner by the Japs and interned at Santo Tomas University in the Philippines ( we have just received the cheering news that they were recently transferred to Shanghai , where the first thing Shelley did was to hunt up a hairdresser ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold : Correspondent Mel Jacoby , killed in a plane crash at MacArthur 's headquarters in Australia , and the MARCH OF TIME 's Harry Garvin , killed in action with the RAF in the Middle East . Across the top of the plaque are the words : " For the Freedom of all People . " <P> Last February some of TIME 's employees joined their friends on LIFE and FORTUNE to organize a Dish-It-Out Party for Navy Relief which more than a thousand people attended . And with Victory Gardening such a big part of the national picture we have just held a Country Fair-which may come as a surprise to some of our subscribers who perhaps think of our editors as city slickers . <P> Everyone at TIME , LIFE and FORTUNE with anything from a window box to a farm in the country was invited to display his produce in the reception room , and when the judges had cast their final vote we found that TIME 's exhibitors had made out pretty well . TIME 's General Manager somehow took the blue ribbon for preserves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air won the title " best farmer " with photographs of his Aberdeen-Angus cattle .
