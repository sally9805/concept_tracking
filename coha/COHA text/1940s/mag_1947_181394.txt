" I tell them how to do things , " mumbled Goodman Ace ( he had a six-inch Dunhill cigar in his mouth ) , " and they say yes , and do n't do them . They wo n't ever learn until some day when all the people will get fed up and turn off all the radios . " <P> Ace , 47 , makes a very good living as CBS 's curator of comedy , but he does n't approve of radio . Longtime writer-director-co-star of Easy Aces , he is an expert on the medium he loves to pan : " Now take the rating system . That 's the stupidest thing I ever heard of . What do you think would happen if a drama critic said Finian 's Rainbow was a good , solid 10.4 ? " In the old days , Ace scornfully poohpoohed Easy Aces ' consistently low Hooperating by explaining that " the people who are listening to me are so crazy about the program they wo n't even get up to answer the phone . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks and talks a good bit like Jack Benny , has been CBS 's No. 1 doctor for sick comedy and variety programs ( " I wanted the office space " ) . When a sponsor does n't like a CBS show , Troubleshooter Ace is called in to patch it up . When CBS wants something new , Ace and a staff of four writers go to work . He is pretty discouraged at the moment over his efforts of the past few months . The Ace-originated CBS Was There ( TIME , Aug. 4 ) was abandoned after seven weeks , and Ace is gloomy about his Robert Q. Lewis Little Show ( TIME , June 23 ) : " I gave ' em a good , tight , 15-minute comedy show and what do they do ? They expand it to half an hour and throw in an orchestra and an audience . . . . Who the hell said a comedy show had to be half an hour ? Marconi ? Ida Cantor ? " <P> When Easy Aces , radio 's earliest and sharpest husband &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after 14 years and some 2,400 broadcasts , Goodman and wife Jane decided to watch the ponies and take life easy for awhile . But within six months , Goodie was back in radio , earning just about the top dollar for a writer ( $3,000 weekly ) as Danny Kaye 's chief scripter . When Kaye left for Hollywood , Ace quit again . <P> Then one day Jane was cleaning house in their Ritz Tower apartment when she ran across a pile of old Easy Aces transcriptions . With his race-track sense of a good thing , Goodie arranged with Ziv transcription agency ( TIME , April 28 ) to farm out the old records to hundreds of independent stations . The canned Easy Aces is now heard by a bigger audience than ever listened to it as a live show and nets the Aces an easy $75,000 a year . <P> " Kind of Stupid . " Last week CBS 's Ace was doggedly plugging away at a new script show , a projected variety program , new props for the Little Show . He was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' But she 's pretty fussy , " says Ace . " We offered her a 7 p.m. spot , and she would n't take it because it interfered with her cocktails . Then we suggested a half-hour program , once a week , but she was afraid of the audience . Finally CBS said to give her anything she wanted - so she picked an afternoon spot five days a week , and no audiences . Now that I 've got the show ready for her , she 's talking about a half hour with a ' tiny ' audience . "
