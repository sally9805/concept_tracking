txt There is no easy solution to the shipping strike . In fact , at this stage there is visible no outcome which will be other than bad . The reason is that the situation has now reached a point where it is possible to deal only with effects instead of causes , and there appears to be no area of settlement which can produce other than harmful effects . The Government can concede to the striking A. F. of L. maritime workers the wage increase which , the War Stabilization Board has ruled inflationary . But if it does , it will be opening the gates to a new wave of wage demands and strikes which will sink the Administration 's last little life raft of inflationary controls . The Government can act to break the strike by force ; it can try to load and man the ships with the Army and Navy . But it is no sure thing that such action could break the strike . Since Congress rejected Mr. Truman 's emergency strike-control bill , the President is without authority to require workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conceivably , the strikers could be persuaded to accept a lower wage increase . But since both the shipowners and one agency of the Government , the War Shipping Administration , have approved the higher wage raise after long negotiation , there is little prospect that the A. F. of L. unions will back down . These are the reasons there is apparently no outcome to the maritime strike which possibly . can look good or yield good . A A Numerous factors have contributed to the present impasse . Some of them go back many months . Nobody need claim  --  nor accept  --  a monop oly of responsibility . There obviously is enough blame for everybody . This is not a strike of labor against employer . It is a strike of labor , whose- wage demands the employers have approved , against the Government  --  against the Government 's rejection of wage increases it deems inflationary . It is useful to look at the whole pattern of events which have led up to this situation . There are at least six contributing factors : 1 . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove wartime economic controls immediately after Japan surrendered . As a result of this , the dike was opened to a rush of price increases , wage increases , costof-living increases  --  and then another round of the same . 2 . Mr. Truman later tried to correct hiS original mistake ? to keep an authoritative ORA functioning and wages under control . But Congress let OPA expire for several weeks , during which prices took another spurt , and then revived a shadow of the original law . The Administration is now having trouble applying even mild curbs to wages . 3 . Mr. ? Truman asked for probably more strike-control powers than he needed , and Congress , with its eye fixed on Msotiated Press Tied Up the election , riddled his proposals . Thus Congress vetoed the President , and , in rejecting the Case bill , the President replied by vetoing the Congress . The rail strike passed ; Congress passed ; the President passed , and here we are with 3,000 ships and 5,000 freight cars immobilized. 4 . Both employers and employees share in defying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by negotiating A. F. of L. wage increases $5 to $10 a month higher than those recently granted the larger C. I. 0 . maritime union ; the workers by striking against the Government 's decision . 5 . Overhanging all of these circumstances are the Administration 's own vacillating , self - contradictory wage-andlabor policies . They show up sharply in the present shipping strike . One arm of the Government , the War Shipping Administration , has publicly and authoritatively approved the A. F. of L. maritime wage increase which the unions and shipowners had negotiated . Thereupon , another arm of the Government , the Wage Stabilization Board , stepped in to reject the wage increase as too high and as violating the Administration 's anti - inflation policies . 6. % Finally , there seems to be evidence that the top leadership of the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . unions would welcome a period of industrial quiet in order to increase production and productivity and to keep labor from suffering further public disfavor at this time . They . can not always control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients of industrial chaos . If free enterprise and free labor can not exercise self-restraint , they face drastic Government restraints . Abuse of their own powers will impair their own  --  and everybody 's  --  freedom .
