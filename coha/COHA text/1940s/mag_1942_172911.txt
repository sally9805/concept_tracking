Curious new uses for familiar vibrations : <P> &gt; Sound waves from an ordinary auto horn can be used to increase the rate of gasoline distillation by agitating the air in which the condensing molecules and droplets hang . Hence smaller cracking equipment and lower costs are claimed by the patentee of the process , Shell Development Co. of San Francisco . If the blare hurts nearby ears , inaudible supersonics will serve as well . <P> &gt; Radio waves can be used to dry artificial silk as it is spun out of cellulose and reeled into hollow spools . Dried formerly with heat , the outer fibers would dry first and contract upon the inner ones , causing nonuniform drying and shrinkage . But high-frequency radio waves emanating from an antenna in the center of the reel dry the fibers uniformly , avoid shrinkage .
