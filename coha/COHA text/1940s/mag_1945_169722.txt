Less spectacular than aerial deployment but more far-reaching in its implications was another U.S. military job done in China : the organization , equipment and training of an elite corps ( 39 divisions ) within the vast mass of the Chinese Army ( 300 divisions ) . <P> The job was begun about a year ago , when U.S. Lieut . General Albert C. Wedemeyer , a brilliant staff man , took over the China Theater from General Joseph W. Stilwell . Its broad purpose was to give China a modern army that could meet the Japanese on equal terms . The work went forward under the title of Chinese Combat Command . It rapidly became one of the most remarkable training projects in military history . <P> For Victory . The " C.C.C. , " as its wits said , was really neither Chinese nor combat nor command . At its top was a red-faced , outspoken , thoroughly able U.S. field officer-Major General Robert Battery McClure , 49 , native of Georgia and veteran of Guadalcanal . Under him , from brigadier generals to buck privates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within China 's new army . <P> General McClure ran his show from a spacious compound in Kunming , a stone 's throw from the terminus of the Burma Road . He bellowed , spark-plugged and steamrollered the Chinese divisions within the C.C.C . from an amorphous lump into a cohesive weapon . He was assisted by such capable officers as Brigadier General George Olmstead , 44 , a levelheaded lowan who ran G5 ; and Brigadier General Paul Caraway , 39 , West Point-trained son of Arkansas ' Senator Hattie Caraway and an outstanding planner , who served as Deputy Chief of Staff . <P> The C.C.C . was divided into field units , each headed by a Chinese lieutenant general who was advised by an American brigadier general or a colonel . The field units branched off to army , divisional and regimental headquarters , each with its Chinese commander shadowed by an American counterpart . In the lowest rank G.I. 's taught their Chinese equals the operation of Garand rifles , flamethrowers , etc . <P> A general-staff school in Kunming instructed members of the Chinese General Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , signal corps and transport schools taught American methods . <P> The Americans roughed it with the Chinese in the field . On training campaigns , they lived hard together , sweated out long marches , heat and sickness together , ate rice and slum together when U.S. rations ran short . Out of the prodding , teaching , learning and comradeship a new respect and understanding was fashioned between the Allied fighting men . And out of the traditionally primitive and inefficient material of the Chinese Army emerged a confident striking force . <P> For Unity . Last summer the new army was ready for action . With the utmost secrecy it prepared to push through the Japanese " lifeline " in South China , seize a port on the coast and thereby open the country for a U.S. landing . Suddenly the Japanese surrendered . The C.C.C . was denied both a victory and the recognition for which it had labored so long .
