A million dead men heaped the battlefields of southern Russia . Millions more were maimed , captured or missing . Verdun had gulped 738,000 Frenchmen and Germans in 299 days , but Verdun was a lesser horror . Not until long after the war , if ever , would the full losses be known . Russia acknowledged that 606,000 men had been lost in three months and declared that 480,000 Germans had been slain . Germany gave no hint of its own losses , but claimed 1,044,741 Russian soldiers had been captured since spring , raising to five million men their total claims of Russian captives . <P> At such a cost had Marshal von Bock thrust into the Caucasus and heaved his tank-bristling lines to the Don bend where , with seemingly inexhaustible waves of men and weapons , he was making his greatest bid for a breakthrough to Stalingrad and the Volga . At such a cost had Marshal Timoshenko kept his Red Army virtually intact , with supply lines still open to the Caucasus oilfields and munitions centers to the east . Whether the awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford such expenditure of human life and weapons would be tallied only after the battle was decided . <P> Certainly the onrushing waves of Germans indicated that Bock was still able to be prodigal in his attempt to cut the Volga , to push the Red Army back into Asia , to leave it a weakened mass incapable of engaging the full German military might . If that were accomplished on the southern front , Bock could consider his forces well spent . Then , if an offensive in the north were to close the Arctic ports , Russia would indeed be cut off from her Allies ; the Red Army , starved for sufficient supplies , would no longer be an immediate threat to Germanized Europe . <P> In the Don bend the struggle reached a crisis . For three weeks the Germans had inched forward , slowly cleaning out the last Russian resistance west of the river . Now they had bridgeheads across the Don where it crooks within 47 miles of Stalingrad . Two new footholds were won , the sprouting prongs of a pincer designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One prong thrust northeast from Kotelnikov in great force , the other southeast from Kletskaya , in relentless progress that the Red Army was unable to halt . <P> Well to the north , fighting was renewed in the Voronezh sector , but with force insufficient to divert German pressure from Stalingrad . To the south , Krasnodar fell and the Germans swept deeper into the Caucasus . <P> The Russians could find a few hopeful signs . Red Star , the army organ , said the Germans were no longer able to pull up powerful reserves , as they had last July ; Red Star cracked that the Wehrmacht now advances only in ryvok ( jerks ) . " German losses in the last three months , " said the paper , " are slowly but continually laying the basis for inevitable destruction of the Nazi Army . " <P> Even though such optimism was unquenched , the Russian people were repeating a proverb that might fit the dark days still ahead : " Now we see flowers , but later they will turn to seeds . " <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on leave from the Kalinin front , said : " This is not the time for talking . This is the time for fighting . "
