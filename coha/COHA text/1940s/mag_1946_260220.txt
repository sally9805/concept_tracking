The belief of greying , sad-faced Robert Harold Scott , 57 , is deep and abiding . Its single tenet : there is no God . For five years godless Robert Scott pestered San Francisco radio stations to let him air his atheism . Last week , more than three months after an FCC decision in his favor ( TIME , Aug. 5 ) , Station KQW gave him 30 minutes of Sunday morning time to rehash the arguments that have been the unbeliever 's stock-in-trade for many a Christian year . Excerpts : <P> " Though it has not been proved scientifically that no God exists-after all , it is impossible to prove a negative-it is , at any rate , a truth of the highest certainty that there is no God all-wise and allgood who is also all-powerful ; for it goes without saying that an almighty God could have prevented all natural evils . ... He could have prevented the evolution of parasitic and carnivorous forms of life . ... He could have prevented tuberculosis , cancer and infantile paralysis . . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , in any way , made himself unmistakably known to everybody in every generation , amounts , I submit , to positive proof that there is no such being . " <P> The broadcast over , Christians , atheists and studio officials sat back to see what would happen . The reaction was immediate . Within seven days 5,000 listeners had written KQW . Said one : " My hope and prayer is that God will have mercy on Scott and KQW for your disbelief . " Said another : " This is unconstitutional and should be discontinued . " Members of the Southern Baptist Church of Modesto , Calif , voted a protest . Yet 24% of the letter writers , while mostly disagreeing with Scott 's irreligion , commended the station for letting him speak his mind . A Congregational minister expressed their views : " It is good for any institution to be under healthful criticism , including the church . It is good for any theory to defend itself from time to time . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
