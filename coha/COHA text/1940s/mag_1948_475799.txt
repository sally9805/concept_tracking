BY MIDSEASON of last summer the Brook- lyn Dodgers , a quiet , well-behaved lot of ball players who no longer swaggered under the name of the Beloved Bums , were clinging with tenacious claws to first place in the National League . Their hold on such an exalted spot was a tribute to the Brooklyn president , the portly , pious-talking , and shrewd Mr. Branch Rickey , who had figured in the spring that his team of youngsters ( " Rickey 's kindergarten " ) would n't really begin clicking until August 15 . Back in April the Dodgers were unsettled at first and third bases , their pitching staff was uncertain , and , worst of all , they had just been deprived of their aggressive manager , the loquacious Leo Durochcr , who for no ascertainable reason had been banished from baseball for a year by ex-Senator Happy Chandler , the big leagues ' High Commissioner and synthetic tough guy . Rickey had surmounted his managerial troubles by bringing the ancient and loyal Burt Shotton , a friend of four decades ' standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had plugged the gaps in the infield with , characteristic speed . But his pitchers kept going to pieces in the fifth inning , and in June his star outfielder , Pete Reiser , cracked his skull while pursuing and clutching a fly ball at the centerfield barrier at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn . It was all most disconcerting , yet the team continued to stay up there . Rickey , who does n't deal in legerdemain , sometimes wondered just how it was possible . For everywhere he looked from out beneath his shaggy eyebrows , which are strictly on the John L. Lewis order , he saw traps , snares , and elephant pits . Just how dangerous the footing was likely to become Rickey knew better than anyone else , for the traps and snares all bore one legend : " Constructed by Branch Rickey . " Before hiring himself to the Dodgers in late 1942 Rickey had put in twenty-seven years of careful work on the St. Louis Cardinals ? and here , in late July of 1947 , the Cardinals were coming fast , moving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . It was no comfort for Rickey to realize that the entire Cardinal infield was a Rickey-recruited , Rickey-trained bunch of knock-you-down , runyou-over athletes , or that the Cardinal pitchers had been developed in a Rickey-devised minor league farm club system . Nor did it help Rickey to remember that Eddie Dyer , the Cardinals ' manager who had won the pennant in 1946 , had blurted out : " I owe it all to Rickey . " Rickey , who had originally put the Cardinals together , knew that the " old reliables " from St. Louis were the team to beat ? and so it proved in September , when Brooklyn turned back the Cardinal threat . But as August approached there were other teams to beat , too . Curiously enough , they also were teams that owed their eminence to Branch Rickey . First of all , there was a New York team powered by Walker Cooper and Johnny Mize , two ex-Cardinals from the old Rickey system who had collected fifty-three home runs between them by July 31 . And up in Boston there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , Billy Southworth , who was getting a lot out of material that included the ex-Rickey outfielder Johnny Hopp . What Rickey had built threatened to tear Rickey down , and the man who is universally known in baseball as " The Brain " did n't relish the results of his own cerebration . In a fight calculated to prove which was the better man , Rickey or Rickey , Rickey could conceivably get the worst of it . BUT if R ickey did n't have an opposition to spur him on , he would not feel at home , and the fact that he had invented the opposition himself merely saved him the trouble of doing it all over again . The president of the Dodgers , who is called The Mahatma when he is n't called The Brain , fears mediocrity as most men fear the plague , and he knows that lethargy steals upon a man when he lacks competition . An inveterate lighter and chewer of cigars , which he uses as adjuncts to conversation , Rickey has a habit of tossing lighted kitchen matches into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Ann Jones , half suspects him of trying to kindle real fires under himself and the whole office staff . When doctors ask the sixty-six-year-old Rickey when he intends to slow down , he grins and says : " I certainly expect my funeral cortege to move at a dignified pace . " Rickey 's drive to isolate the secret of perpetual motion goes on in spite of an inner-ear complication that sometimes results in dizzy spells when he gets overtired . But when the dizziness has passed , he rises with a cry that his competitors are working nights ? which means that if his officestaff gets home to supper once a week a miracle has happened . With his ball players , Rickey does n't need kitchen matches to build fires under them . He does his best to keep them on low or medium salaries on a general level of sameness ? and so makes them hungry for the extra cash which a World 's Series inevitably brings . When he has a veteran who seems to be fading , the old fellow is stirred to renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rickey stocks his minor league farm clubs ( and Brooklyn has twenty-five of these , ranging from Montreal to Ponca City , and from Abilene to Zanesville ) with the best young talent that a superior scouting system can turn up , and the Brooklyn player who has a faltering spell knows that at least five and maybe twenty eager farm hands are ready to scrap and snarl for his place . When a star player is about to go over the peak , Rickey , who has a sixth sense about such things , sells or trades his contract without compunction or sentiment ? although he will hire a good " organization type " man as a scout , a coach , or a front-office man if the fellow needs a job when his playing days are done . Rickey is a compassionate person when it does n't interfere with his inexorable drive to his goal : the pennant . ( Parenthetically , his piety ? along with his feeling about his mother 's wishes ? keeps him from attending games on Sunday , although he has no objections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) T HE modern game of baseball , with its short right field fences , its hopped-up " rabbit " ball , and its concomitant home-run slugging , owes its character to Babe Ruth . Its integrity is undoubtedly due to the late Judge Landis , the High Commissioner who purged it of gambling influences after the scandalous behavior of the Chicago " Black Sox " of 1919 in throwing the World 's Series to the Cincinnati Reds . But the creativeness of modern baseball is almost entirely the product of Branch Rickey , who has been responsible for most of the innovations of the past four decades . When he was field manager of the St. Louis Browns and the St. Louis Cardinals , he used newfangled sliding pits in which to instruct his players in base running , and he tried to make baseball smartness plain via the institution of the blackboard talk . When a pitcher failed to come to rest on two feet after a pitch , Rickey would carefully explain that a man who was off balance could n't very well leap for a high bounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to master Rickey 's complicated ideas about cut-off plays , or even to catch up with Rickey 's common sense when it was presented in polysyllabic words , but when Rickey moved to the front office of the Cardinals back in 1925 he found plenty of scope for his ingenuity . It was while he was still a field manager with the Cardinals that he devised the farm system , which enables a major league club to save money by developing its own players on minor league teams which it owns or controls . In its way , the farm idea was simple industrial " rationalization " applied to baseball : just as it made sense for Andrew Carnegie to own his own ore mines , his own ore boats , and his own coking coal supplies to support his steel mills , so did it make sense for the Rickey St. Louis Cardinals of 1920 to control their own supply of future stars . But if the idea was simple , it remains true that Rickey was the only man in baseball who had the wit to think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gin rickey , he is still coming up with beautiful simplicities that are as obvious as a full moon once Rickey has made them obvious . Either Mr. Rickey is very smart , or the game which he adorns is as dumb as the late Ring Lardner thought it was . Rickey did n't evolve the farm system idea out of any philosophical bias in favor of business rationalization . He did it because of a condition in St. Louis . The St. Louis National League club had no money back in 1919 . When a Cardinal scout would put in a bid in Albuquerque for a potential Ty Cobb , the Albuquerque owner would call up the rich New York Giants or the flush Chicago Cubs and get a really good price for the rookie . This created a vicious circle in St. Louis : the rich Giants got better , but the poor Cardinals , unable to get and develop young stars with box office appeal , just could n't earn any money at the gate to buy stars from anybody else . Rickey tried various ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to borrow his wife 's rugs for office use when he was trying to impress a visitor and put over a deal . Such makeshift shenanigans could n't compensate for the absence of a good double-play combination , so Rickey , who had been a bright young school-teacher in Scioto County , Ohio , before going on to college at Ohio Wesleyan and to law school at the University of Michigan , bethought himself of a chain-store system of primary , secondary , and tertiary baseball schools . He talked over his proposition with Sam Breadon , a young automobile salesman whom he had persuaded to put $2,000 into the Cardials , and together they pioneered the idea at Houston , Texas , and Fort Smith , Arkansas . With Breadon 's support and money , Rickey 's Cardinals subsequently bought fifty per cent of the stock in the Syracuse club of the International League . First baseman Jim Bottomly alone was worth the purchase price . From here on the Cardinals branched out , buying into Sioux City and many smaller clubs . By 1928 the Cardinal investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were moving upward for nominal sums to the parent St. Louis team . Farmer Rickey 's green fingers grew the sprouts that blossomed as Manager Gabby Street 's pennant winners of 1930 and 1931 and Frankie Frisch 's famous Gashouse Gang of 1934 . St. Louis won six pennants and four World 's Series when Rickey was laboring under President Sam Breadon as the club 's vice presidential general manager in charge of the farm system . I N twenty-seven years with the Cardinals Rickey made more than a million dollars in salary and commissions . But the St. Louis attendance could not equal the figures achieved in such metropolitan areas as Chicago and New York , so Rickey had to develop the selling of players into a fine art in order to create and justify his financial take . When Rickey was a big league catcher with the St. Louis Browns in 1906 and the New York Highlanders ( ancestor of the modern Yankees ) in 1907 , he was n't very good . ( Indeed , thirteen Washington runners stole bases on his lame arm in a single game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a player 's reflexes , which he further developed when he was coach of the University of Michigan bail team in 1910 and 1911 ? the team on which George Sisler , future major league .400 hitter , was both his special project and star . With his uncanny eye for the nature of reflex action , Rickey could tell just when the ripeness of a young star was about to become the rottenness of baseball middle age , which may even begin in a player 's late twenties . In 1937 pitcher Dizzy Dean looked to Rickey to be through forever . Since he is constitutionally unable to tell a lie , Rickey announced to Phil Wrigley of the Cubs that Dean 's arm was dead ? but that he would n't take less than $185,000 for Dizzy 's contract . Wrigley could n't believe that Rickey would be holding out for $185,000 for a dead-armed pitcher , so he bought Dizzy anyway . But dead the arm was , and Rickey chuckled to himself as he pocketed his twenty per cent of the profits . On the Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ducky Wucky Medwick to the Dodgers for $125,000 ) Rickey built the Cardinals into the property which Sam Breadon recently sold to Bob Hannegan 's syndicate for $3,000,000 . In Brooklyn , Rickey 's reward is $50,000 , plus bonuses based on attendance . And the canny player sales go on in Brooklyn , even though Ebbets Field can attract more spectators in the course of a year than St. Louis 's Sportsman 's Park ever succeeded in doing . Last year Rickey realized some $600,000 in cash for ball players ' contracts sold to Pittsburgh , Boston , and Philadelphia ? and the old Ebbets Field debt has been paid off with a rapidity that no longer pleases the Brooklyn Trust Company , which has had its profitable lien on the Dodgers ever since the estate of the late Charles Ebbets fell into disarray . Rickey 's pre-eminence as a baseball business man is based on the mastery of conceptual thinking that first produced the farm club idea . He has basic theories about everything , and he employs mathematical concepts in working them out . Amathematical theory of probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balancing a ball team . What Rickey aims at is a blend of speed , throwing arms , and power , with fast outfielders like Pete Reiser compensating for average-good pitchers , and with fast baserunners like Jackie Robinson stretching doubles into triples and potential infield outs into singles . In his salad days Rickey carried a little notebook filled with the names of promising sandlot , high school , and college ball players ; now he has a card-index system covering the nation 's schools and minor leagues . To move up in the Rickey chain gang , a young man must have at least two of the three qualifications of speed , throwing arm , and power ; Rickey does n't go for mere sluggers , or mere speed kings , or mere throwers . When he was still with the Cardinals he sold Johnny Mize to the New York Giants because Johnny had little beyond slugging ability to recommend him ? and also because St. Louis had two brilliant farm club first basemen , Ray Sanders and Johnny Hopp , ready to replace him . Always Rickey strives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend of blends in the team . He likes pitchers who can vary their pitching direction , first sweeping the ball in from halfway to third or first base , then zooming it down from extension-ladder height . And he keeps track of his blends and blend of blends with mathematical precision ; he now has a statistician at work at $7,000 per annum traveling with the team and jotting down the nature of every pitch by a Brooklyn pitcher and every hit by a Brooklyn batter . THE theory of mathematical prob- ability is reinforced by the keen Rickey eye , which takes in all details of physiology , anatomy , and psychology . It was Rickey who made George Sister over from a pitcher into the greatest first baseman of all eras . Once at a Cardinal training camp , Rickey heard the crack of a bat against horsehide , and looked up to see the ball hit the fence . " Judas Priest , " he shouted , " who hit that ball ? " " Hafey , " came the reply . " He 's a pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Rickey . " Tell him he 's no longer one . He 's an outfielder . " The keenness of this instantaneous judgment was corroborated when Chick Hafey developed into one of the heaviest hitters in the National League . Last spring Dixie Walker , popular Dodger right fielder , was hitting well above the .300 mark . But to Rickey , the reflexes of the thirty-six-year-old Dixie seemed to be slow ing up . He started in with the inexorable mathematical analysis , and discovered that Dixie , a left-handed batter , was slicing a big percentage of his hits into left and left-center fields instead of " pulling " them straight and true into right field in the old Walker manner . The Rickey statistician reported a difference of 100 points in Dixie 's effectiveness against right-and left-handed pitchers . This all meant that Dixie was tired or going over the peak . In June rumors hit the sports pages that Rickey was contemplating the idea of peddling Dixie to Pittsburgh . Whether this would be good business or not involved a mathematical conjecture ; he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dixie 's big name , but on the other hand , Dixie 's Brooklyn fans might stay away from the park in droves to protest the deal . ( They might even hang Rickey in effigy in front of Brooklyn 's Borough Hall . ) The question was : would Dixie bring in more in a trade than he would bring in at the gate ? In the end Rickey postponed the sale of Dixie to the winter months in which even Brooklyn fans grow relatively lethargic . But the first rumors of the trade were followed by a revival of Dixie Walker 's old-time playing form ; the burr that Rickey put under the veteran 's tail evidently worked . In the late winter , when Rickey is wrangling about contracts with his young men , he trots out the systematic thinking all over again . His theory that scantily-paid ball players will fight doubly hard for World Series cash naturally does n't go down with the athletes , but Rickey has a plausible line which he buttresses with actual statistics . An overpaid ball player , he argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age than might otherwise be the case ; therefore the owner who dishes out too much money too early is cutting years of top earning power off a man 's playing life . Rickey can keep theball of salary palaver spinning so merrily and in such a confusing way that players sometimes accede to his demands out of sheer intellectual exhaustion . Once a holdout ball player was urged to get together with Rickey and settle their salary differences . " Not me , " he answered . " I ai n't going to see Mr. Rickey . Five minutes with him and I 'll sign anything he hands me and I wo n't be a hold-out any more . " S INCE coming to Brooklyn , Rickey has been a trifle more generous with veterans ' salaries than in his old Cardinal days . But he bases the generosity that paid Dixie Walker $25,000 for 1947 on the fact that Brooklyn is a richer gold mine than St. Louis , not on any change in his basic philosophy . The proper salary for a ballplayer , says Rickey , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay , ( 2 ) the player 's ability to earn , and ( 3 ) the relationship of the player 's income to that of others on the team . What Hank Greenberg may be getting in Pittsburgh or elsewhere for the home runs he hit three years ago in Detroit has nothing to do with the case . But if Rickey sees no other way of binding a man 's loyalty he will loosen up the purse strings . In 1933 the Cardinals , needing a shortstop , purchased Leo Durocher from Cincinnati . Leo stormed into Rickey 's office and informed his new boss that he was n't going to take any Sunday school lecturing from a pious old cheapskate . " Leo , " said Rickey calmly , " we 've bought your contract from Cincinnati . It is n't as much as I 'd like to pay you , but I do n't believe in tearing up contracts . So there 's a thousand dollar bonus waiting for you at the treasurer 's office . " Scarcely able to believe his ears , Leo gulped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ousted last season as Brooklyn manager by High Commissioner Chandler , Leo prefaced his departure with an earnest tribute to Mr. Rickey , who had given his tacit promise to fight to bring the errant bad boy back to the Dodgers as field boss in 1948 . Rickey takes pride in his ability to reform Durocher at periodic intervals ; as he says , " evil is transient . " In 1934 when the Cardinals were in the thick of a pennant fight , Rickey persuaded a business woman friend of his , the attractive Grace Dozier , to consummate a romance by marrying Leo a few days before the St. Louis-Detroit World 's Series " just to clear his mind . " With his mind cleared , the benedict Durocher played a bangup game to defeat Detroit . Unfortunately the marriage is numbered among those which did n't last , but Mr. Rickey has high hopes that Leo 's romance with the moving picture star Laraine Day will steady the boy permanently ; Miss Day neither smokes , chews , drinks , gambles , nor swears . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgers is that Leo never rests on old laurels ; each game is a career with Leo . Burt Shotton , on the other hand , might have grown conservative after his 1947 pennant . Rickey is naturally high on " sincere " types like Lou Boudreau , the college-bred , family-man shortstop-manager of Cleveland . He quickly weeds out the gamblers , drinkers , and " roosters " on his teams if he ca n't reform them ; in fact , his dislike of high-stake gambling explains the departure of certain supposedly key Dodgers after Rickey came to Brooklyn in late 1942 . But for all his dislike of liquor and gambling Rickey has an inordinate affection for real screwballs . He would die of inanition if he did n't have a Dizzy Dean or a Pepper Martin in his past to spin yarns about ( he tells a wonderful novel-length story of how Dizzy Dean permanently lost track of his father when a mile-long freight train came between the two cars which were carrying the Dean family over the face of Texas ) . Undoubtedly the value of screwballs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , but he also responds to the challenge which a hell-raising ball player presents . He knows that if he can " reclaim " a wastrel or a drunkard , he will bind the fellow to him with hoops of steel ? and maybe make a hundred thousand dollars out of him . It was a reformed and grateful Billy South-worth who won the pennant as manager of the Cardinals in 1942 . T HE mathematics of reform may be somewhat tenuous in Rickey 's mind , but when it comes to the mathematics of a swap he has things figured out to the last decimal point . Before going into a trading session he first puts a money price on all the players he hopes to swap and all the players he hopes possibly to get . Then he proceeds to translate the money prices into simple units for quick addition in his mind ? say , Pitcher Kirby Higbe equals 10 units , Pitcher Hank Behrman equals 5 , Infielder Gene Mauch equals 2 , Outfielder Gionfriddo equals 4 and so on . When the sessions get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition throwing in extra rookies and aged pitchers , Rickey is likely to come out of the deal with $150,000 in cash and ball players for the $130,000 worth of baseball ivory he has just given away . Naturally , any evaluation of a ball player who is being swapped for another ball player is subjective , at least to some extent , but Rickey takes a fiendish delight in seeing a confused opponent putting two separate money valuations on a man during the course of a session . Rickey 's own unit system of valuation keeps this from happening to himself ; he always makes sure his units balance when the columns are added . He is n't telling the identity of the victims of his unitary figuring , for he has to deal with the same club owners and managers year after year . Even so , anyone who has dealt with Rickey half suspects that he has been hornswoggled ; the gag around the National League circuit is that Rickey would sell a player he did n't expect to see live through the summer . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't hurt Rickey 's chances in a trade , for he is such a master of longwinded doubletalk that he can spout forever without divulging a thing . III R ICKEY left the St. Louis Cardinals in late 1942 when the war destroyed the basis for his customary $80- or $90,000-a-year take . With the military draft scooping up the promising farm club kids , the St. Louis club decided that it must hang on to its veterans ? and there was literally nobody for Rickey to peddle to the other clubs for fantastic sums and fantastic commissions . Since Mrs. Jane Moulton Rickey , an Ohio country storekeeper 's daughter whom Rickey had married after first breaking her down with more than a hundred proposals , had her roots in St. Louis , where she had raised a son and five daughters , this matter of pulling up stakes was an unwelcome prospect to the whole Rickey tribe . Rickey could have taken a job with the St. Louis Browns of the American League and gone on living in his charming home at Country Life Acres , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pa 's " stories about being cornered in a boat by an alligator and missing pheasants which " flew out the back way . " But there were two other prospects that beckoned : first , the prospect of taking over the Philadelphia Phillies and lifting them out of their customary berth in the league cellar , and second , the tantalizing prospect of giving Brooklyn a baseball organization commensurate with the enthusiasm of the one really baseball-mad town in the United States . The choice was put up to nineteen of " Rickey 's boys " ? key scouts and business managers in the Cardinal chain system who could be counted on to follow Rickey anywhere . After hours of deliberation the decision was unanimous : " Go to Brooklyn ! " And so Rickey pulled up stakes at the age of sixty-one , sold his home , and entered previously hostile Flatbush as general manager . ( Later he and his friends bought stock control of the club . ) With Wid Mathews , one of the great judges of neophyte baseball talent , with brother Frank Rickey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent scout as he was once a first baseman , Rickey started to build up a Brooklyn farm system to surpass the one he and his men had created for St. Louis . Today the Brooklyn system , with its twenty five minor-league clubs , is a multi-million-dollar investment . The Montreal , St. Paul , and Fort Worth clubs are owned outright . And the fact that three-fourths of the farm teams finished in the first division in 1947 argues plenty of talent for future Dodger teams . To keep in touch with the soil after coming to the Flatbush pavements , Rickey has bought himself a salt water farm at Chestertown ; Maryland . He commutes to his rural hideout whenever possible , getsup at dawn to run the disk-harrow , and has even been known to shave in a taxicab crossing Brooklyn Bridge in order to get in an extra hour 's sleep in the country before returning to his Montague Street office . Chestertown , however , sees but little of him during the summer season . Although he is afraid of high places ( he even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking too precipitately at the distant ground ) , Rickey spends the working baseball season hopping about the country in a private plane . En route between farm clubs and crucial series he and his wife and cronies play a wildly interminable game of Hearts . They seldom look out unless they are passing over Rickey 's native county in Ohio , in which case the Rickey family gazes at the old home scene and says " moo-o-o . " At table the Rickeys play a strange game : one of the Rickeys will suddenly put a finger to his or her nose , which is a signal for all to follow suit . The last person to touch the nose is banished to a place beneath the table , where he or she must eat in darkness and ignominy . Mrs. Rickey 's mother , who is nearing a hundred , is usually exempted . B EFokE the advent of Rickey , Brooklyn baseball had been on a hit-or-miss basis . Once upon a time , when Charles Ebbets and Steve McKeever were alive , the team had made money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among heirs , and easy credit at the bank , the club had fallen under the sway of the Brooklyn Trust Company , which had everything to recommend it except a knowledge of inside baseball . During the pre-Rickey days Brooklyn sometimes won a pennant or staggered home in second place with ancient castoffs who were prone to " September wilt , " but there was no more system to this procedure than there was to Manager " Uncle " Wilbert Robinson 's eccentric method of benching outfielders whose names he had forgotten how to spell correctly for the starting lineup slip . And the Brooklyn civic inferiority complex , which demands a perpetual winner , went pretty much unassuaged . The first attempt at soothing Brooklyn 's feelings was made in 1937 , when the Dodger directors , acting on Rickey 's adBRAINS , BASEBALL , vice , hired the flamboyant Rickey protege , Larry MacPhail , to rebuild the club from scratch . MacPhail installed new lighting fixtures , painted the stands , and purchased a whole army of Big Name ball players , including some extra-special ivory from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manager ( bought , incidentally , from Rickey ) , MacPhail finally won a pennant in 1941 . But the cost of getting championship athletes such as Medwick , Mickey Owen , and Durocher from Rickey was staggering , and the profit-starved Brooklyn directors evidently thought it cheaper in the long run to buy Rickey direct . Accordingly the bid went out in 1942 and Rickey accepted . Rickey and the nineteen " Rickey boys " had correctly doped Brooklyn 's characteristics . They had figured that Brooklyn was a country town which needed a shrewd country boy ? i.e. , Branch Rickey , from the Duck Run country of southern Ohio ? to help it along in its baseball fortunes . When he was a hungry farm kid in Duck Run , Rickey had developed an overmastering desire to outslick all city slickers , and the drive persists to this day . Rickey is a vague fellow who gets lost on subways and commuters ' trains ; he wears a suit or a hat until his wife takes it away from him ; he is perennially short of pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has even been known to mop his brow with two black socks taken absently from his hip pocket in the middle of an important speech . But the vagueness merely means that Rickey has a genius 's ability to concentrate with overwhelming intensity on the problem at hand . When he missed his commuter 's stop in suburban Forest Hills , where he lived until recently , it merely indicated that he was about to pull off a deal that would mean all the difference between a winner or a loser . ry HE Rickey need for compensation just matches Brooklyn 's need for the same thing . Rickey has been com-pensating ever since he taught school in Duck Run , where it was a mark of peda-gogical success to keep the hulking louts in the front row from soiling teacher 's shoes with tobacco juice . By dint of brain-power Rickey mastered the louts . He learned Latin and Greek in his spare time in his strenuous efforts to prepare for Ohio Wesleyan , where he finally managed to catch up with the rest of his class in senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the world on fire . He lost his first major league job with Cincinnati when Manager Joe Kelley , a tough , irreverent old Baltimore Oriole , fired him because of his refusal to play Sunday ball . Later he failed to stick with the St. Louis Browns and the New York Highlanders . The reason for his failure became obvious in late 1907 , when the doctors told him he had tuberculosis . The t.b . setback merely whetted Rickey 's appetite for success . After a winter at Saranac , Rickey went to the University of Michigan , where he crammed three years of law school work into two years in the intervals when he was n't coaching the baseball team . He failed to make ends meet as a lawyer in Boise , Idaho , where he hung out his shingle in 1912 . Colonel Bob Hedges of the St. Louis Browns rescued him from poverty by hiring him as his Pacific Coast scout in 1913 . During his year as a scout Rickey sent three winning ballplayers to the Browns ? an outfielder named Patterson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leverenz and Agnew were Brown standbys for years . And when Rickey moved east from the Pacific Coast to manage the Browns he signed his college protege , George Sisler , who promptly began to knock down the American League fences . At sixty-six the ability to appreciate young ballplayers is still ? ickey 's chief business asset . But he no longer relies on chance abetted by his own eyesight ? or even on the farm club idea which he pioneered with the St. Louis Cardinals . Brooklyn 's farm system is first-rate : for example , its Montreal club in the International League , managed by the shrewd Clay Hopper , usually contains enough talent on its payroll to send up replacements guaranteed to give Brooklyn a winner for some years to come . Brooklyn 's twenty-eight full-time scouts , many of whom came east with Rickey from St. Louis , are as keen as any in the game . But where other major league clubs have their farm systems to compete with Brooklyn 's , Rickey has gone them all one better . Each year , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own crop of farm-club rookies . A year ago , in Pensacola , he and his scouts processed some six hundred young ballplayers , giving them forced-draft instruction in sliding , batting stance , pitching follow-through , and other polished baseball savvy that it takes an ordinary Giant or Brave rookie , for example , two or three years ' experience to learn . With the finishing school added to the farm system , Rickey figures that he has a two- or three-year advantage over the rest of the field . By the time the New York Giants and the Cincinnati Reds and the rest of the National League clubs have built up their own finishing schools , Rickey will undoubtedly have another idea to keep him at the head of the procession . Even though his competitors are " working nights , " Rickey counts on his own superior wit and cleverness to turn up better ideas than can be provided by anybody else in the game . THE best recent example of Rickey 's wit and cleverness is the Jackie Robinson story . When the New York State Antidiscrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Committee for Unity with a subcommittee to consider the problem of the Negro in baseball . The subcommittee included Larry MacPhail of the Yankees , Bill Robinson , the Negro tap dancer , Judge Jeremiah Mahoney , Arthur Daley , sports columnist of the New York Times , and ? Branch Rickey . The slow deliberations of the committee drove Rickey mad , and characteristically he decided to bypass the committee business by going out into the field and hiring a good Negro player to play for Brooklyn or one of the Brooklyn farm teams . While other clubs were debating the Negro problem in doubletalk as a sociological issue , Rickey was spending $25,000 to search the continent . Scouts finally reported that a certain Jack Roosevelt Robinson , shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs , a crack Negro club , had major league potentialities . Rickey had him signed at once , and senthim to Montreal . As the Montreal second baseman , Robinson led the International League in batting with .349 and spark-plugged his team to the pennant . An exU.C.L.A. athlete whose speed had enabled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and broadjumping , Robinson was a better answer to the " Negro problem " than anything that the La Guardia subcommittee could turn up . Last year Rickey brought Robinson up to Brooklyn and had him installed as the club 's first baseman . During the early weeks of the season Robinson labored under a strain . Some sixty per cent of the National League 's ballplayers are from the Southern states , and Robinson was fearful of plunking the ball too hard into a Mississippian 's ribs or of taking out a Georgia-bred shortstop with a rolling block calculated to break up a double play . But early in June Jackie 's natural adventurousness cropped out ; he scored all the way from first in Chicago on a sacrifice , and in Pittsburgh he stole home . By the end of July he was hitting .300 and leading the Dodger regulars in batting . He was also leading the league in stealing bases and in scoring runs . By September he was the Rookie of the Year . Now that he has become an accepted institution , Robinson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National League . Other Negroes were quickly signed in the wake of Robinson 's exploits ? Doby by Cleveland , and Thompson and Brown by the St. Louis Browns . But Rickey , with his usual acumen , has already cornered the best talent in the Negro baseball world . Roy Campanella , the Montreal catcher , is a Negro ? and Campanella played a game in 1947 that makes him a logical candidate for this year 's Dodgers . And Rickey 's Dan Bankhead , Negro pitcher , has the makings of a corner . Rickey normally takes an hour to answer a simple question : his method of illustration is to develop a parable with the drawling , long-winded but quite telling art of that other Ohio story-teller , Sherwood Anderson . The roundaboutness of Rickey 's conversational and literary habits makes it impossible to quote him extensively without bursting an article or a sports column at the seams . But in the case of Robinson , Rickey is succinct . Asked if he had brought Robinson up to " solve a sociological problem , " Rickey said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the pennant . I 'd play an elephant with pink horns if he could win the pennant . " Such an answer puts the " Negro problem " in its right perspective . It also puts Rickey in his right perspective . In St. Louis they used to say that " turmoil follows Rickey around and perches on his shoulder . " In Brooklyn they pronounce it toimurl , and it poiches on the shoulder . Keeping up with Rickey is a hectic procedure . But as long as the turmoil pays off with a first-place perch for the Dodgers , Brooklyn is going to be for the strenuous life as lived by Branch Rickey . Even if he plays a pink elephant in the outfield.
