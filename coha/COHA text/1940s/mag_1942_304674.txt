" Listen , all you cats and fine chicks , I want you to dig a mess of this jive . Because I want to hip you to my buddy-boy , Hollywood Al . He knows those fine hip styles you all like so much-that extra-wide knee 28 , 29 , 30 inches and that peg bottom way down to 14 inches-that are really a killer . . . .

Lovers of swing tune in every evening on WHOM in Jersey City to listen to his After Hour Swing Session ( 11 p.m. to midnight , E.W.T. ) . <P> Formerly Sid conducted a radio program of recorded symphonies accompanied by cultured comments in a lush bass .

Actually he is slim , slick , pallid Sidney Torin , 33 , brought up in Brooklyn 's slums . For a year Symphony Sid lived in Harlem , acquired a full knowledge of Negro speech and habits . Today he even dresses like many Negroes , wears peg trousers ( modified ) , a flat porkpie hat with a wide brim , knee-length camel's-hair coat , suede shoes .
