The sturdy Dutch inhabitants of Walcheren Island did not want to leave their flooded homes . The grey sea had snaked through Walcheren 's bomb-breached dikes , coiled around hamlets and towns , drowned their handsome black- &-white; Friesian Holland cattle . It had also brought salty death to orchards , pastures , grain fields . But most farmers and burghers shook their heads when Allied amphibious ducks chugged up to take them away . <P> At Domburg only one Dutchman was willing to go . It was the same in Oostkapelle , Westkapelle , Veere and all the other dike-side communities . Worried officials knew the marooned folk had food for two or three months . But they had little fuel for heating . Diphtheria , typhoid and influenza were spreading . And when the flood tides and angry storms of late winter and early spring struck Walcheren , what then ? There might be famine . Baffled officials wondered if they should evacuate the people by force . <P> The Will of Man . By his labor a man imparts a portion of his life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of death . Nor does a man easily leave the soil his father and forefathers have wrested from the sea . The great basalt dike at Westkapelle had been started 500 years ago . The Germans had built pillboxes on it . Allied bombers had breached it . Commandos had poured through its gaps , in the wake of the rushing sea . Here &; there , like beached sea monsters , still sprawled the rusting hulks of dead British armor . <P> The salt water which covered much of Walcheren ( 82 square miles ) had undone the labor of generations . The once-rich soil would need five years , after dikes had been mended and sea pumped out , to become fruitful again . But the villagers , who remembered past floods and patient replanting , thought of life 's struggle in longer terms . Of their dead fruit trees and flowering hedges they said : " Our children will live to see them again . " <P> They were already making attempts to reclaim their soil . On dry isolated spots farmers hoed sugar beets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences above the water . At one place dike workers mended the torn sea wall in the age-old manner . A score of them hauled on the ropes of a leaden pile driver , keeping time to the chant of a greybeard . <P> The Will of God . The simple Godfearing people of Walcheren had no hard feelings against the British . They said that the Germans would have cut the dikes if the British had not . They accepted the trials of war as they accepted the trials of the sea . They did not despair . In the will of Providence rested ultimate good . <P> They knew , for example , that the trim little schoolhouse at Westkapelle was doomed . Its floor had become a black mire . Its desks were coated with oil and refuse left by the tide . Soon the whole building would crumble into the sea . But on its blackboard , beyond the water 's reach , they had chalked three words : Wij zijn bevrijd- " We are liberated . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
