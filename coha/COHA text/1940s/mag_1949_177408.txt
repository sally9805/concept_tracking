Flamingo Road ( Warner ) sends Joan Crawford traveling , somewhat wearily , down the well-beaten Hollywood trail of rags-to-riches . This time the trail begins in a small town when Joan ditches her job with a broken-down carnival and meets up romantically with Deputy Sheriff Zachary Scott . Next she gets a respectable job as a local waitress . Before she ends up in the town 's biggest mansion , as the wife of the state 's biggest politico ( David Brian ) , she has to take a series of plot hurdles and heartbreaks . Biggest hurdle of all is Scott 's vicious , milk-drinking boss ( Sydney Greenstreet ) . <P> Flamingo Road is not even paved with good intentions . Jerry-built out of odds &; ends of cliches , it is an unashamed reworking of a formula that has been familiar to Joan Crawford 's fans for a couple of decades . The tired old plot is in no way improved by Joan 's new hairdo , which is blonde and unbecoming . Sydney Greenstreet , with his lashless , inscrutable stare , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen similar roles . As usual , he gets the dirtiest end of the dialogue . Sample , as Joan pulls a gun on him : " I should have spit you out the first time you lit between my teeth . " <P> Mr. Belvedere Goes to College ( 20th Century-Fox ) gives Clifton Webb a chance to go on playing the comedy role that turned last year 's Sitting Pretty into a smash box-office hit . Mr. Belvedere is no longer a babysitter , but he is still insufferably and hilariously patronizing ; he is still a self-confessed genius and he is still broke . His bestselling book , Hummingbird Hill , has won him fame , but lost him a fortune in libel suits . All he has left is a $10,000 prize which he can collect only by taking a college degree . With acidulous hauteur , he enrolls as a freshman at Clemens University , gets a job as hasher at the Triple Gamma sorority house , and sets out to take four years of higher education in one . <P> From there on , Webb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his freshman cap with the same deadpan elegance he gives to his cane and his well-draped suit . In his job as hasher , he can toss up crepes Belvedere or lecture the young women of the sorority on table manners . At the piano in the sorority parlor , he can play Beethoven or boogie , but he prefers the works of Belvedere . His biggest , and perhaps funniest , moment comes at the Freshman-Sophomore track-meet when he lays aside his dog-eared book , rolls his well-creased trousers above his knobbly knees and stalks out on the field to win the pole vault and a freshman victory . <P> What is left of the story is carried rather heavily by Shirley Temple and Tom Drake , two undergraduates busily involved with love and misunderstandings . But most of the time Director Elliott Nugent , who has a special knack for this sort of thing , keeps his lens and sound track trained on Clifton Webb . By neatly trimming the tone and pace of the film to Webb 's personal high-comedy style , he has kept the Belvedere formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Columbia ) is the latest film by John Huston , maker of the 1948 prizewinner , Treasure of the Sierra Madre , As movie melodramas go , it is above average , but it is not Grade A Huston . Purporting to be a courageous film about Cuba 's 1933 revolution , Strangers is , unfortunately , no stranger to some old , slick Hollywood tricks .
