Americans can stop worrying about the projected 1,500-mile highway to Alaska , because nature has provided another one , of which only 300 miles of road need to be constructed . So claims Arctic Explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson in the July issue of FORTUNE . Most of his highway consists of the Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers . His 300-mile road would connect the two rivers . Says Stefansson : " In North America the Mackenzie River , second only to the Mississippi system , is the historic commercial highway of northwestern Canada . It begins to be navigable at the head of rail north of Edmonton , and flows almost straight in the direction of Japan and China . The Yukon is the third longest river highway of the North American continent , and the Mackenzie , 300 miles from its delta , is only 300 miles from the head of navigation of the Yukon . " Stern-wheelers have long traveled both rivers , which ( claims Stefansson ) winter freezes into ice-paved roads for sledge-pulling tractors . During a three or four-week freeze-up in autumn and the breakup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both ships and tractors . Stefansson adds : " A generation that tends to think lazily in terms of railroads , ships and trucks has almost forgotten the value of river highways . "
