Americans who have listened through radio 's well-meant , sometimes brilliant but often talky , overdone , and unrealistic attempt to propagandize the war since Dec. 7 had something to stand up and cheer for last week : The Army Hour . A brand-new , 60-minute Sunday afternoon show put on by the U.S. Army , it had the welcome ring of authenticity . <P> Army Hour is a worldwide show with a worldwide cast . It is designed for three fronts : the U.S. ( over NBC ) , the United Nations , and the U.S. troops abroad ( by RCA short-wave radio ) . Last week all three could hear something of what the others were doing . <P> From Chungking , one of Brigadier General Claire L. Chennault 's pilots described recent exploits of his famed Flying Tigers . His best news : one entire flight of Jap bombers annihilated . From London , two pilots of America 's Eagle Squadron , flying with the R.A.F. , spoke pleasantly of their life and adventures . One ( Pilot Officer Jack Mooney ) had just returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said the other ( Fred Almos ) : " It 's a good life ; it 's an exciting life , and we like it . ' <P> For most Americans at home , this was the first direct word from their soldiers in the field . The men in Bataan , Australia , the Middle East , Iceland , Ireland also had their innings . For them , as well as the home front the Army put Secretary of War Stimson , Lieut . General Lesley McNair , commander of the Army Ground Force , and the commanders of the four U.S. home armies on the air . Their soldierly words , though guarded , managed to convey a reassuring outline of the growing U.S. Army . <P> &gt; A Fort Meade private ( Frederick Gaither ) came on the air with his partner , a Garand rifle named " Stinky , " and discussed its make-up and accomplishments with Sportscaster Bill Stern . This was an easygoing , informative skit , especially for anyone unaware that U.S. soldiers now carry armor-piercing rifle ammunition to drill through the belly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment , hitherto the stumbling block of U.S. radio propaganda . Army Hour managed it without slopping over . Its brief drama of a World War I veteran seeing his son off to World War II was just about right . Said he : " If we 'd finished the job when we were there , you would n't be going now . " Said the son : " You had your April the sixth ; we 've got our December the seventh . . . . This time we 're going to fix it so this thing ca n't ever happen again . . . . " <P> The show was a good first try . It was a show that anyone but Axis sympathizers could enjoy . It had information , guts , a good musical score , and the best dramatic material extant ( the fighting fronts themselves ) to draw from . If its makers use these priceless , uncensored gifts wisely , they may have the hit show of the year .               @ @ @ @ @ @
