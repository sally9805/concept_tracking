Apple-cheeked , apple-growing Senator Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia , whose committee has been mulling over ways &; means of cutting down Government expenses , turned in his report to Congress . <P> The report recommended savings that would cut $1,301,075,000 in non-defense items out of the Government 's expenditures , which this fiscal year will amount to $25 billion . Some of them : <P> &gt; No more CCC , no more non-defense activities for NYA . ( The President two months ago suggested that Congress combine CCC and NYA for economy 's sake , got no action . ) <P> &gt; Reductions in WPA , Public Works ( including flood control ) and Federal Highways . <P> &gt; Dropping of all land-purchase , Farm Tenant and Farm Security loans . <P> As a minority member of the committee , Progressive Senator Robert M. La Follette wrote a separate report , sharply attacking Senator Byrd 's findings . The cuts proposed , said Bob La Follette , would fall on the neck of " the very lowest income groups among our population , " would cripple programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of total war . . . . No one can disagree with the general objective , " added La Follette . " The crux of the matter is . . . ' where is the waste ? ' " <P> But this week the scholarly , economics-wise Brookings Institution brought up its reserves in support of Senator Byrd , recommended even bigger savings ( $2,085,000,000 ) than had Byrd 's committee . Brookings ' proposed cuts , mostly from the same places Byrd would make them , would take more from agriculture , much more from highways , flood control and public works . The Brookings report said that the Government had not yet really come to grips with the situation , added : " Yet if the will to do so exists , the proposed $2,000,000,000 curtailment can be made without difficulty . "
