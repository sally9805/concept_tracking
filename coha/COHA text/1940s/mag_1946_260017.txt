Fifty miles northeast of the Island of Hispaniola lies the Milwaukee Depth. * There the ocean 's floor scoops down 30,246 ft . There , last week , the earth 's crust ground silently against itself and distant seismographs marked the characteristic pattern of an earthquake on their sensitized film records . <P> The Dominican Republic had it worst . Like all the island 's north coast the city of Matanzas got a hard jolting . But the tidal wave that followed the shock was the real killer as it swept into town and village . In one place , 40 cockfight fans were trapped under the collapsing tin roof of their circular pit and then drowned by the rush of water . Elsewhere , the nimble skipped to trees and rooftops . In Ciudad Trujillo , where people were celebrating the 450th anniversary of the city 's founding by Columbus ' brother , five churches were damaged and ordered closed . <P> At week 's end , the Dominican Republic still shook . On the hills , refugees huddled under trees and in caves . Up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo himself , Dominicans had not known such disaster since 1930 , when a hurricane swept the republic . Then , says an official biography , Trujillo appeased the angry weather gods . But now he was apparently too busy with politics ( see below ) . <P> <P> *Named after the U.S. light cruiser Milwaukee , whose officers discovered it with the sound gear in 1939.
