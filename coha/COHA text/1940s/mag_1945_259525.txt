When scholarly , able Roswell Magill was Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury , he performed many a service for taxpayers . This week Mr. Magill performed another one . He and the Committee on Postwar Tax Policy , which he chairmanned through 16 months of work , put out A Tax Program for a Solvent America ( The Ronald Press Co. ; $3 ) , the most comprehensive yet readable of all recent tax studies . It is also , the committee hopes , what an " intelligent and realistic <P> Secretary of the Treasury " might present to Congress , and have a good chance of putting into effect in the first " normal " year , i.e. , about 1948 . <P> Unlike the plans of Ruml-Sonne , the Committee for Economic Development , et al. , the committee makes no guess at what the national income may be , come normal times . What it does do is set up three different budgets of $15 , $18 and $22 billion based on national incomes of $115 , $125 and $140 billion . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way to provide the greatest incentive for business to make jobs and employment . The committee 's idea was that federal spending must be cut , that the budget must be balanced yearly . As the best method of doing this , the program recommended that : <P> The 3% normal tax on individual in comes be eliminated and that only surtaxes apply , these to be fixed at the initial rate of between 15% and 20% , depending on the size of the budget . <P> Corporation taxes , as a general rule , be set no higher than income taxes . <P> The excess profits tax be repealed , although the carry-back of unused excess profits tax credits be retained for two years . <P> Estate , gift and gasoline taxes be collected only by the states . <P> The capital gains tax be left unchanged for at least five years . <P> A 5% federal sales tax be imposed if the budget is $22 billion . The committee feels it would be hard to raise enough cash to balance the budget otherwise . <P> The committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relying almost entirely on income and corporation taxes , the U.S. is relying on a broken reed . Example : during the depression , U.S. tax revenues were cut in half as the national income plummeted . In England , where the income drop was great , revenue remained steady , thanks to the British system of levying heavy excise taxes . In effect , the committee argued : if alcohol is taxed , why not tea and coffee ? <P> Many of the recommendations , as the committee was well aware , are not new . But where the committee parted company with other planners , notably Beardsley Ruml , was in insisting on a budget balanced every year rather than over the business cycle . Its chief argument was that deficit spending is a " narcotic " which , once used , is a threat of progressive inflation .
