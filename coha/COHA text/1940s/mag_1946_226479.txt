Evelyn Waugh is a devout Catholic . He is also a devout esthete and a devout snob . This week , in LIFE , he wrote an open letter to U.S. readers of his best-selling Brideshead Revisited ( TIME , Jan. 7 ) , which showed that these three traits are inseparable parts of his fastidious revulsion from the godless , uncivilized age in which he finds himself . He also revealed that-as some critics of Brideshead had sug-rested-his literary motivation is basically religious : <P> " Like a shy waterfowl who has hatched out a dragon 's egg , I find that I have written a ' best-seller . ' ' Unseasonably , ' because the time has passed when the event brings any substantial reward . In a civilized age this unexpected moment of popularity would have endowed me with a competency for life . ... As it is , the politicians confiscate my earnings and I am left with the correspondence . . . . " <P> Even You , Mrs. Schultz . " A lady in Hempstead , N.Y . asks me whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schultz , I do not . It is horrible of you to ask . <P> " A novelist has no business with types ; they are the property of economists and politicians and advertisers and other professional bores of our period . . . . The Common Man does not exist . He is an abstraction invented by bores for bores . Even you , dear Mrs. Schultz , are an individual . <P> " ... Another question : ' Are your books meant to be satirical ? ' No . Satire is a matter of period . It flourishes in a stable society and presupposes homogeneous moral standards-the early Roman Empire and 18th-Century Europe . ... It - is aimed at inconsistency and hypocrisy . It exposes polite cruelty and folly by exaggerating them . It seeks to produce shame . All this has no place in the century of the Common Man where vice no longer pays lip service to virtue . The artist 's only service to the disintegrated society of today is to create little . . . systems of order of his own . I foresee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the monks after the first barbarian victories . They were not satirists . . . . <P> " Nor am , I worried at the charge of snobbery . Class-consciousness , particularly in England , has been so much inflamed nowadays that to mention a nobleman is like mentioning a prostitute 60 years ago . The new prudes say : ' No doubt such people do exist but we would sooner not hear about them . ' I reserve the right to deal with the kind of people I know best . " <P> Godless Novelists . " ' When can we expect another Brideshead Revisited ? ' Dear ladies , never . ... I have already shaken off one of the American critics , Mr. Edmund Wilson , who once professed a generous interest in me . He was outraged ( quite legitimately by his standards ) at finding God introduced into my story . I believe that you can only leave God out by making your characters pure abstractions . . . . <P> " The failure of modern novelists since , and including , James Joyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content with the artificial figures which hitherto passed so gracefully as men and women . They try to represent the whole human mind and soul and yet omit its determining character-that of being God 's creature with a defined purpose .
