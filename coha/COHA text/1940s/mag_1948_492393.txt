The Angel of Happy Hollow By JOHN MALONEY FORTY-THREE years ago , Elizabeth Collins , a frail mite of an Englishwoman , walked over a mountain range and down into a Southwestern Virginia mining village with only thirty-three cents in her pocket , but with a great desire in her heart to minister to miners ' families . The miners did n't want her ; they held that " book larnin ' " was another name for " divilment , " that any preacher in their midst , whether man or woman , meant interference with their brand of fun , and that nu " outlander " could teach them better ways of living than they already knew . They threatened to run Miss Collins out of the mountains , but she made seats and desks out of powder kegs and dynamite boxes and opened the village 's first school in her living room . Despite open hostility , she helped " birth " miners ' children , nursed them when they were sick , made coffins and preached funerals for them when they died . Many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she generally found some destitute miner 's child with whom to share even that , When the year 199 ' 7 drew to a close she had been mother-confessor counselor , preacher , doctor , nurse and , above all , time-proved friend to thousands of miners throughout the rough coal fields where Tennessee , Kentucky and Virginia touch , for almost half a century . But a lifetime of dedication , often strenuous and exhausting , scarcely ever without hardship , was also drawing to a close . On Decemberthirtieth she died in peace , leaving the mountain villages desolate at her passing . A short time before her death , after spending two months in a Richmond hospital , eighty-one-year-old Elizabeth Collins was escorted from the train at Big Stone Gap to her cottage ten miles back in the mountains by a brass band , every instrument in it blown or beaten by sons , grandsons or great-grandsons of miners who originally had resented her uninvited presence among them . To neighbors in her own village of Roda , as well as to miners from six other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fact that " Toddy , " as themountain people knew her , was well and back with them again was sufficient reason for temporary shutdowns in eight mines and a whole day of rejoicing at Roda'a community church . The church at Roda was also the scene of a ceremony in her honor on New Year 's Day , 1948 . But there was no rejoicing . The tears of generations fell for Toddy at her funeral . Through all of Wise County , Virginia , where she labored longest , her word was law  --  whether she was dealing with the sheriff , the president of a coal company , an obstreperous youngster or parents who would n't co-operate with a truant officer . Yet no one back in those mountains can recall hearing her voice raised in anger against anyone . Knowledge of her disapproval was enough to stop anything , from a brawling drunk to a civic ordinance she believed detrimental to the welfare of her boys or their families . When Toddy first came across Big Black Mountain and down into Rods , mining camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be  --  villages made up of irresponsible , hard-drinking , **32;3306;TOOLONG cutthroats who signed their names with an X , lived on canned goods from company commissaries and worked , at most , one month in a mine before moving on to another . Their children often were put to work driving donkeys or grading coal in the mines when ten years old . They made their own moonshine , were suspicious of all outsiders and frequently would say . " I may have been born an Epitteopalian , but I 'm Presbyterian enough to believe that if God wants me to have food , He 'll find a way for me to have it , with h a little extra , too , for my more needy neighbors , " On one occasion , she told me before she died , she had naked a little mountain child if its parents said grace before meals . " We never have enough to say grace over , " the child had replied . Toddy was able so completely to blend her own life into that of these mountain people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her being called an outlander . She was able to recall more than 200 funerals at which she officiated , hut , she said seriously when talking of death in these mountain homes , " It 's a lot of pleasure to think that more people have been named for me than I have helped bury . " At Toddy 's insistence , the company , years ago , built a little nondenominational community chapel at the head of Rods valley , and the Methodist church has furnished ministers for it . They came and went , but Toddy was the keystone of the little congregation . Today her picture , which was snapped and enlarged by one of her favorite " grandsons , " hangs behind the chapel pulpit . Young members of the congregation several years before her death installed a large easy chair for her comfort during the frequent services she attended or conducted . By intercommunity agreement , the third Sunday in July for ten years past has been observed as " Toddy 's Home-Coming Day . " Miners from all the **27;3340;TOOLONG coal fields brought their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all-day visit on the church grounds . Toddy and the village women were busy cooking for a week beforehand . Young girls scoured the church from front steps to altar ; others combed the mountains for Toddy 's favorite flowers , and a beef or pig was barbecued for the feast . This past year , because of Toddy 's recent illness , " sons , " " grandsons " or " great-grandsons " came back on her day from eleven states . Many of them brought children whom Toddy had never seen and whom she received in 1 the manner of a matriarch blessing her i descendants . On this day , too , one of .. , her " boys " just released from prison wept on her shoulder when he reached her in the receiving line , asking her to forgive him his crime , as if he were accountable to her alone . Company doctors and nurses and a full-time minister now are carrying on r most of the work Toddy inaugurated f , back in those hills and valleys . In her f last years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treks over rough trails to seek out those who needed her help , but her little white cottage was still the heart of the village . On bright days Toddy sat enthroned in a rocker on her front porch with a dignity that reminded one of the queen who patted her on the head seventy-two years ago . There was a smile or greeting from every miner , every child or tradesman who passed . While I sat with her one afternoon she waved to a group of passing schoolgirls in pigtails , then turned to me . " These people are wonderful , are n't they ? " she said proudly . Frequently when mothers she taught as young girls brought their own children to see her , they first of all asked to see the little kindergarten table in Toddy 's living room , where , twenty or more years ago , they learned to make buttonholes , to knit or to crochet . ? . , Three or four afternoons weekly until her death the little table was encircled by eight- or Len-year-old girls learning stitches that Toddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room itself was a personal museum . In one corner was a bird 's nest some young admirer found on the mountain . There were pictures or war souvenirs " grandsons " sent from Germany , Alaska and several Pacific battlefields , along with photographs of graves in foreign lands . Boxes and drawers bulged with letters and cards she got from her " children " in almost every mail , and the cooky jar on the kindergarten table was kept full , just as it had been for four decades . Knowing Toddy 's love for children and for people generally , I could not resist once asking her why she 'd never married and had a family of her own . Her eyes twinkled . " It is n't because I have n't had proposals enough . " Her first serious offer , she recalled , came from a prosperous young South Carolina planter . She accepted and was preparing for the wedding when , during one of her fiance 's calls , he picked up the family cat and maliciously swung it by its tail to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man showing such a streak of cruelty , " Toddy said simply . There were other proposals after this , she admitted , but they were all turned down . Her last came only a few years ago , and from an unexpected source . An old miner whose wife Toddy several times had nursed through childbirth and illness during her first years in Roda moved to Kentucky , and she had lost track of the family . The man turned up at her cottage about ten years ago , along with two grown sons , and it was not long before he got down to business . His wife had died recently , he said , and he was downright lonesome . " Hit ai n't good fer no man to stay by hisself no way , " he said earnestly . " We'uns ' ud be mighty proud would you marry me and go back to Kaintucky . " This proposal , coming when she was past seventy , so surprised Toddy that she bad to leave the room for a moment to hide her confusion . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old miner for his thoughts , but explained that her work was so important she could not think of leaving it . This was the signal for the two sons to begin a campaign on their father 's behalf . After listening for two hours to impassioned pleas , Toddy finally was able to escape to evening service when the church bell rang . " Imagine such goings-on at my age , " Toddy said when friends teased her about it . Friends in Richmond , relatives in North Carolina and ex-miner friends who have moved away and prospered in other fields used to try to get Toddy to make her home with them , but she declined each invitation . The little white cottage was hers for life , and the mine company long ago had granted her a generous allowance to cover any need she might have . Toddy 's wants would have been simple anywhere , but she could not live for a day , she declared , without the love with which her " children " surrounded her . Recently Dr. Benjamin C. Henson , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toddy for twenty years , was sitting on her back steps absent-mindedly flipping pink pills to her chickens . Toddy reproved him for wastefulness . " Do n't worry about a few pills , Toddy , " Doctor Henson told her . " These people do n't need stronger medicine than the faith and hope you have taught us all to have . "
