There was one more important job to do ; then the tired , sad-eyed man with the soft voice and spring-steel will could go home . From his somber headquarters in Berlin this week , the U.S. Military Governor for Germany would send the order to the troops and civilians of his command : get the trains , trucks and barges moving back into Berlin . After that , General Lucius DuBignon Clay would be heading back to the U.S. for retirement . <P> He had wanted to leave many times before , but President Truman had always kept him on . Now the time was appropriate . The blockade of Berlin was ending . The Western Germans were ready to form their own federal government ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . In Clay 's own words , " the punitive phases " of the Allied occupation were finished ; the State Department was almost set to take over . Last week the President announced that General Clay would turn over his command next week to his deputies , Lieut . General Clarence Huebner and Major General George P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could move in . <P> A Unified Germany . The next day , America 's crack occupation troops bade their commander a military farewell . On the vast parade field at Grafenwohr , once a training ground for Adolf Hitler 's Wehrmacht , 11,000 U.S. soldiers snapped and wheeled through a 90-minute review . A battery of 105-mm. guns barked a 17-gun salute . From a jeep the 52-year-old general stood stiffly and watched the display , a hint of tears in his eyes . Overhead , in a brilliant , cloudless sky , 60 Thunderbolt fighters formed a gigantic C-L-A-Y as they roared past , and then , joined by whooshing F80 jet fighters , they swept low over the grandstand for the final salute . <P> The American correspondents had their own final drill with him . Leaning comfortably against the upholstery of his private railroad car , General Clay looked back on his four grinding , controversial years as a 20th Century proconsul . A unified Germany , he thought , is now inevitable , but there must be another five to 20 years of gradually tapering Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an East-West agreement on Berlin should not be confused with " a permanent solution to the struggle between communism and democracy . " Said Clay : " I do n't think that implies war . War would never solve it . " <P> A Solid Symbol . For West Pointer Clay , the four years in Germany had been full of trouble , full of achievement , frustration-and plenty of criticism from all sides . The French objected violently to his singleminded , often stubborn determination to put Germany on its feet economically . Germans of all parties considered him too sternly unyielding . The State Department , sometimes slow in spelling out policy , fumed over his penchant for making policy himself . There were constant wrangles with the EGA . A civilian investigating committee complained only last month that General Clay 's administration had deliberately refused to break up two of Germany 's once-mighty cartels .
