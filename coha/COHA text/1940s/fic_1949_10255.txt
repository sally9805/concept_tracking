It was stuffed with suits and shirts and shoes , from golf clothes to evening dress . I went through the pockets systematically . In the breast pocket of a jacket I found a wallet . The wallet contained a mass of twenties and a single photograph . I held it up to the bulb that lit the closet . It was a sibylline face , with dark and mournful eyes and a full drooping mouth . On either side the black hair fell straight to the high necklineof a black dress that merged into artistic shadows at the bottom of the picture . A feminine hand had written in white ink across the shadows : " To Ralph from Fay with Blessings . " It was a face I should know . I remembered the melancholy eyes but nothing else . I replaced the wallet in Sampson'sp31jacket and added the picture to my photographic collection of one . " Look , " Miranda said , when I stepped back into the room .

The ruddy light shone through my hand and reminded me that I contained a skeleton . " Open your eyes . " She opened them . smiling . " You saw it , did n't you ? The sacrifice on the heathen altar  --  like Salammbo . " " You do read too many books , " I said . My hand was still on her shoulder , conscious of sunned flesh . She turned toward me and pulled me down . Her lips were hot on my face . " What goes on ? " Taggert asked , from the doorway . The red light on his face made him look choleric , but he was smiling his same half smile . The incident amused him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not amused . Miranda was the freshest thing I 'd touched in many a day . She made the blood run round in my veins like horses on a track . " What 's so hard in your coat pocket ? " Miranda said distinctly . " I 'm wearing a gun . " I pulled out the dark woman 's picture and showed it to both of them . " Did you ever see her before ? She signs herself Fay. "  | " I never did , " said Taggert . " No , " said Miranda . She was smiling at him side-eyed and secretly , as if she had won a point . She 'd been using me to stir him up , and it made me angry . The red room made me angry . It was like the inside of a sick brain , with no eyes to see out of , nothing to look at but the upside-down reflection of itself . I got out . I pressed the bell , and in a minute arich female voice gurgled in the speaking-tube . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is Morris home ? " " Sure . Come on up .

" I winced , but she did n't notice . " Morris slept in this morning . He 's still eating breakfast . " I glanced at my watch . It was three thirty . Morris Cramm was night legman for a columnist and worked from seven in the evening to five in the morning . His wife led me through a living-room-bedroom combinationcrowded with papers and books and an unmade studio bed . Morris was at the kitchen table , in a bathrobe , staring down two fried eggs that were looking up at him . He was a dark little man with sharp black eyes behind thick spectacles . And behind the eyes was a card-index brain that contained the vital statistics of Los Angeles . " Morning , Lew , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's late afternoon . " " It 's morning to me .

I would n't have minded being convinced that the Sampsons were a dream . I showed him the picture signed " Fay . " " Do you know the face ? I have a hunch I 've seen it before , and that could mean she 's in pictures . She 's a histrionic type . " He studied the . piece of cardboard . " Superannuated vampire .

She makes a little money doing bit parts . Sim Kuntz makes a place for her in his pictures . He was her director in the old days . " " She would n't be an astrologist on the side ? " " Could be .

Handsome if you like an aging chorus boy . " " You know I do . Anybody else ? " I could n't show him Sampson 's picture or mention Sampson 's name . He was paid for collecting names in groups of two . Very badly paid . " Once at least . She had late supper with a fat tourist-type dressed in ten-dollar bills .

" " He 's doing an independent on the Telepictures lot . She might be out there . I heard they 're shooting . "  |p35I  handed him his bill . He kissed it and pretended to use it to light a cigarette . His wife snatched it out of his hand . When I left they were chasing each other around the kitchen , laughing like a couple of amiable maniacs . My taxi was waiting in front of the apartment house . I took it home and went to work on the telephone directories for Los Angeles and environs . There was no Fay Estabrook listed . I called Telepictures in Universal City and asked for Fay Estabrook . The operator did n't know if she was on the lot ; she 'd have to make inquiries . On a small lot it meant that Fay was definitely a has-been where pictures were concerned . The operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but she 's working just now . Is there a message ? " " I 'll come out . What stage is she on ? " " Number three . " " Is Simeon Kuntz directing ? " " Yes . You have to have a pass , you know . " " I have , " I lied . Before I left I made the mistake of taking off my gun and hanging it away in the hall closet . Its harness was uncomfortableon a hot day , and I did n't expect to be using it . There was a bag of battered golf clubs in the closet . I took them out to the garage and slung them into the back of my car . Universal City wore its stucco facades like yellowing paper collars . The Telepictures buildings were newer than the rest , but they did n't seem out of place among the rundown bars and seedy restaurants that lined the boulevard . Their plaster walls had a jerry-built look , as if they did n't expect to last . I parked around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the main entrance of the studio . There were ten or twelve people sitting on straight-backed chairs outside the casting-office , trying to look sought-after and complacent . A girl in a neat black suit brushed threadbare was taking off her gloves and putting them on . A grim-faced woman sat with a grim-faced little girl on her knee , dressed in pink silk and whining . The usual assortment of displaced actors  --  fat , thin , bearded , shaven , tuxedoed , sombreroed , sick , alcoholic , and senile  --  sat there with great dignity , waiting for nothing . I tore myself away from all that glamour , and went down the dingy hall to the swinging gate . A middle-aged man with a chin like the butt end of a ham was sitting beside the gate in a blue guard 's uniform , with a black visored cap on his head and a black holster on his hip . I stopped at the gate , hugging the golf bag as if it meant a great deal to me . The guard half opened his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that might arouse his suspicions , I said : " Mr. Kuntz wants these right away . " The guards at the majors asked for passports and visas and did everything but probe the body cavities for concealed hand grenades . The independents were laxer , and I was taking a chance on that . He pushed open the gate and waved me through . I emerged in a white-hot concrete alley like the entrance to a maze and lost myself among the anonymous buildings . I turned down a dirt road with a sign that said " Western Main Street , " and went up to a couple of painters who were painting the weather-warped front of a saloon with a swinging door and no insides . " Stage three ? " I asked them.  | " Turn right , then left at the first turn . You 'll see the sign across the street from New York Tenement . " I turned right and passed London Street and Pioneer Log Cabin , then left in front of Continental Hotel . The false fronts looked so real from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made me feel suspicious of my own reality . I felt like throwing away the golf bag and going into ContinentalHotel for an imitation drink with the other ghosts . But ghosts had no glands , and I was sweating freely . I should have brought something lighter , like a badminton racquet . When I reached stage three the red light was burning and the soundproof doors were shut . I set the golf bag down against the wall and waited . After a while the light went out . The door opened , and a herd of chorus girls in bunny costumes came out and wandered up the street . I held the door for the last pair and stepped inside . The interior of the sound stage was a reproduction of a theater , with red plush orchestra seats and boxes , and gilt rococo decorations . The orchestra pit was empty and the stage was bare , but there was a small audience grouped in the first few rows . A young man in shirt sleeves was adjusting an overheadbaby spot . He called for lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the center of the first row facing a camera . I moved down the side aisle and recognized Fay before the light went out . The light came on again , a buzzer sounded , and there was a heavy silence in the room . It was broken by the woman 's deep voice : " Is n't he marvelous ? " She turned to a gray-mustached man beside her and gently shook his arm . He smiled and nodded.  | " Cut ! " A tired-looking little man with a bald head , beautifullyclothed , in pale-blue gabardines , got up from behind the camera and leaned toward Fay Estabrook . " Look , Fay , you 're his mother . He 's up there on the stage singing his heart out for you . This is his first big chance ; it 's what you 've hoped and prayed for all these years . " His emotional central European voice was so compelling that I glanced at the stage involuntarily . It was still empty . " Is n't he marvelous ? " the woman said strenuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a real question . It is a rhetorical question . The accent is on the marvelous : " " Is n't he marvelous ! " the woman cried . " More accent . More heart , my dear Fay . Pour out your mother love to your son singing so gloriously up there behind the footlights . Try again . " " Is n't he marvelous ! " the woman yelped viciously . " No ! Sophistication is not the line . You must keep your intelligence out of this . Simplicity . Warm , loving simplicity . Do you get it , my dear Fay ? " She looked angry and distraught . Everyone in the room , from assistant director to prop man , was watching her expectantly . " Is n't he marvelous ? " she said throatily . " Much , much better , " said the little man . He called for lights and camera . " Is n't he marvelous ? " she said again . The gray-mustached man smiled and nodded some more . He put his hand over hers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The smiles faded into weary boredom . The lights went out . The little director called for number seventy-seven . " You mayp39go , Fay . Tomorrow at eight . And try to get a good night 's sleep , darling . " The way he said it sounded very unpleasant . She did n't answer . While a new group of actors was formingin the wings of the theater stage and a camera rolled toward them , she rose and walked up the central aisle . I followed her out of the gloomy warehouse-like building into the sun . I stood in the doorway as she walked away , not quickly , with movements a little random and purposeless . In her dowdy costume  --  black hat with a widow 's veil and plain black coat  --  her big , handsome body looked awkward and ungainly . It may have been the sun in my eyes or simple romanticism , but I had the feeling that the evil which hung in studio air like an odorless gas was concentrated in that heavy black figure wandering up the empty factitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continental Hotel corner , I picked up the golf bag and followed her . I started to sweat again , and I felt like an aging caddy , the kind that never quite became a pro . She had joined a group of half a dozen women of all ages and shapes which was headed for the main entrance . Before they got there , they turned off into an alley . I trotted after them and saw them disappearing under a stucco arch labeled " Dressing Rooms . " I pushed open the swinging gate beside the guard and started out . He remembered me and the golf clubs : " Did n't he want them ? " " He 's going to play badminton instead . "  | I was waiting when she came out , parked with my motor idling at a yellow curb near the entrance . She turned up the sidewalk in the other direction . She had changed to a well-cut dark suit , a small slanted hat . Will or foundation garments had drawn her body erect . From the rear she looked ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a black sedan , unlockedit and got in . I eased out into the traffic and let her slide into the lane ahead of me . The sedan was a new Buick . I was n't concerned about her noticing my car . Los Angeles County was crawling with blue convertibles , and the traffic on the boulevard was a kaleidoscope being shaken . She added her personal touch to the pattern , cutting in and out of lanes , driving furiously and well . In the overpass I had to touch seventy to keep her in sight . I did n't think she was aware of me ; she was doing it for fun . She went down Sunset at a steady fifty , headed for the sea . Fifty-five and sixty on the curves in Beverly Hills . Her heavy car was burningrubber . In my lighter car I was gambling at even odds with centrifugal force . My tires screeched and shuddered . On the long , looping final grade sloping down to Pacific Palisades I let her go away from me and almost lost her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned off the boulevard to the right . I followed her up a road marked " Woodlawn Lane , " which wound along the hillside . A hundred yards ahead of me as I came out of a curve she swung wide and turned into a driveway . I stopped my car where I was and parked under a eucalyptus tree.  |p41Through  the japonica hedge that lined the sidewalk I saw her climb the steps to the door of a white house . She unlockedit and went in . The house was two-storied , set far back from the street among trees , with an attached garage built into the side of the hill . It was a handsome house for a woman on her way out . After a while I got tired of watching the unopening door . I took off my coat and tie , folded them over the back of the seat , and rolled up my sleeves . There was a long-spouted oilcanin the trunk , and I took it with me . I walked straight up the driveway past the Buick and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big enough to hold a two-ton truck with space for the Buick to spare . The queer thing was that it looked as if a heavy truck had recently been there . There were wide tire marks on the concrete floor , and thick oil drippings . A small window high in the rear wall of the garage looked out on the back yard just above the level of the ground . A heavy-shouldered man in a scarlet silk sport shirt was sitting in a canvas deck chair with his back to me . His short hair looked thicker and blacker than Ralph Sampson 's should have . I raised myself on my toes and pressed my face against the glass . Even through its dingy surface the scene was as vivid as paint : the broad , unconscious back of the man in the scarlet shirt , the brown bottle of beer and the bowl of salted peanuts in the grass beside him , the orange tree over his head hung with unripe oranges like dark-green golf balls . He leaned sideways , the crooked fingers of his large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed the bowlp42and scrabbled in the grass like a crippled lobster . Then he turned his head , and I saw the side of his face . It was n't Ralph Sampson 's , and it was n't the face the man in the scarlet shirt had started out with . It was a stone face hacked out by a primitive sculptor . It told a very common twentieth-century story : too many fights , too many animal guts , not enough brains . I returned to the tire marks and went down on my knees to examine them . Too late to do anything but stay where I was , I heard the shuffling footsteps on the driveway . The man in the scarlet shirt said from the door : " What business you got messing around in here ? You got no business messing around in here . " I inverted the oilcan and squirted a stream of oil at the wall . " Get out of my light , please . " " What 's that ? " he said laboriously . His upper lip was puffed thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was , and he was n't as wide as the door , but he gave that impression . He made me nervous , the way you feel talking to a strange bulldog on his master 's property . I stood up . " Yes , " I said . " You certainly got them , brother . " I did n't like the way he moved toward me . His left shoulderwas forward and his chin in , as if every hour of his day was divided into twenty three-minute rounds . " What do you mean , we got them ? We ai n't got nothing , but you get yourself some trouble you come selling your woof around here . " " Termites , " I said rapidly . He was close enough to let me smell his breath . Beer and salted peanuts and bad teeth . " You tell Mrs. Goldsmith she 's got them for sure . "  | " Termites ? " He was flat on his heels . I could have knocked him down , but he would n't have stayed down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirted more oil at the wall . " The little muckers . " " What you got in that there can ? That there can .

" " I do n't know no Mrs. Goldsmith . " " The lady of the house . She called up headquarters for an inspection . " " Headquarters ? " he said suspiciously . his scar-tissuepaddedbrows descended over his little empty eyes like shutters . " Termite-control headquarters . Killabug is termite-control headquarters for the Southern California area . " " Oh ! " He was puzzling over the words . " Yeah . But we got no Mrs. Goldsmith here . " " Is n't this Eucalyptus Lane ? " " Naw , this is Woodlawn Lane . You got the wrong address , bud . " " I 'm awfully sorry , " I said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodlawn . " He smiled widely at my ridiculous mistake . " I better be going then . Mrs. Goldsmith will be looking for me . " " Yeah . Only wait a minute . " His left hand came out fast and took me by the collar . He cocked his right . " Do n't come messing around in herep44any more . You got no business messing around in here . " His face filled out with angry blood . His eyes were hot and wild . There was a bright seepage of saliva at the cracked and folded corners of his mouth . A punchy fighter was less predictablethan a bulldog , and twice as dangerous . " Look . " I raised the can . " This stuff will blind you . " I squirted oil in his eyes . He let out a howl of imaginary agony . I jerked sideways . His right went by my ear and left it burning . My shirt collar ripped loose and dangled from his clenched hand . He spread his right hand over his oil-doused eyes and moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared . A door opened behind me when I was halfway down the drive , but I did n't show my face by looking back . I ducked around the corner of the hedge and kept running , away from my car . I circled the block on foot . When I came back to the convertible the road was deserted . The garage doors were closed , but the Buick was still standing in the drive . The white house among its trees looked very peaceful and innocent in the early evening light . It was nearly dark when the lady of the house came out in a spotted ocelot coat . I passed the entrance to the drive before the Buick backed out , and waited for it on Sunset Boulevard . She drove with greater fury and less accuracy all the way back to Hollywood , through Westwood , Bel-Air , Beverley Hills . I kept her in sight . Near the corner of Hollywood and Vine , where everything ends and a great many things begin , she turned into a private parking lot and left her car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter Swift 's , a gaudy figure walking like a slightly elated lady . Then I went home and changed my shirt.  |p45The  gun in my closet tempted me , but I did n't put it on . I compromised by taking it out of the holster and putting it in the glove compartment of my car . The back room of Swift 's was paneled in black oak that glowed dimly under the polished brass chandeliers . It was lined on two sides with leather-cushioned booths . The rest of the floor space was covered with tables . All of the booths and most of the tables were crowded with highly dressed people eating or waiting to be fed . Most of the women were tight-skinned , starved too thin for their bones . Most of the men had the masculine Hollywood look , which was harder to describe . An insistent self-consciousness in their loud words and wide gestures , as if God had a million-dollar contract to keep an eye on them . Fay Estabrook was in a back booth , with a blue flannel elbow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden by the partition . I went to the bar against the third wall and ordered a beer . " Bass ale , Black Horse , Carta Blanca , or Guinness stout ? We do n't serve domestic beer after six o'clock . " I ordered Bass , gave the bartender a dollar and told him to keep the change . There was n't any change . He went away . I leaned forward to look in the mirror behind the bar and caught a three-quarters view of Fay Estabrook 's face . It was earnest and intense . The mouth was moving rapidly . Just then the man stood up . He was the kind who was usually in the company ofp46younger women , the neat and ageless kind who turned a dollar year after year at nobody knew what . He was the aging chorus boy Cramm had described . His blue jacket fitted him too well . A white silk scarf at his throat set off his silver hair . He was shaking hands with a red-haired man who was standing by the booth . I recognized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own table in the center of the room . He was a contract writer for Metro named RussellHunt . The silver-haired man waved good-bye to Fay Estabrook and set his course for the door . I watched him in the mirror . He walked efficiently and neatly , looking straight ahead as if the place was deserted . As far as he was concerned it was deserted . Nobody lifted a hand or raised a lip over teeth . When he went out a few heads turned , a couple of eyebrows were elevated . Fay Estabrook was left in her booth by herself as if she had caught his infection and could communicate it . I carried my glass to Russell Hunt 's table . He was sitting with a fat man who had a round ugly nose turned up at the tip and bright little agent 's eyes . " How 's the word business , Russell ? " " Hello , Lew . " He was n't glad to see me .

I do not drink to dissipate myself . I dissipate the megrims . " " Hold it , " said agent eyes . " If you 're a creative artist you may sit down . Otherwise I can hardly be expected to waste my time with you . " " Timothy is my agent , " Russell said . " I am the goose that lays his golden eggs .

I did n't like the crack , but I 'd come for information , not exercise . He saw the look on my face and turned to the waiter who was standing by his chair . " Who was that you were shaking hands with ? " I asked Russell . " The elegant lad in the scarf ? Fay said his name was Troy . They were married at one time , so she ought to know .

" " The date . " " The second of June . " " Really ? I did n't expect you to be Geminian . Geminis have no heart . They 're double-souled like the Twins , and they lead a double life . Are you cold-hearted , Archer ? " She leaned toward me with wide , unfocused eyes . I could n't tell whether she was kidding me or herself . " I 'm everybody 's friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Childrenand dogs adore me . I raise flowers and have green thumbs . " " You 're a cynic , " she answered sulkily . " I thought you were going to be sympathetic , but you 're in the Air triplicity and I 'm in the Water . " " We 'd make a wonderful air-sea rescue team . " She smiled and said chidingly : " Do n't you believe in the stars ? " " Do you ? " " Of course I do  --  in a purely scientific way . When you look at the evidence , you simply ca n't deny it . I 'm Cancer , for example , and anybody can see that I 'm the Cancer type . I 'm sensitive and imaginative ; I ca n't do without love . The people I love can twist me around their little finger , but I can be stubborn when I have to be . I 've been unlucky in marriage , like so many other Cancerians . Are you married , Archer ? " " Not now . " " That means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he often marries a woman older than himself , did you know that ? " " No . " Her insistent voice was pushing me slightly off balance , threatening to dominate the conversation and me . " You 're very convincing , " I said . " What I 'm telling you is the truth . " " You should do it professionally . There 's money in it for a smooth operator with a convincing spiel . " Her candid eyes narrowed to two dark slits like peepholes in a fort . She studied me through them , made a tactical decision , and opened them wide again . They were dark pools of innocence , like poisoned wells . " Oh , no , " she said . " I never do this professionally . It 's a talent I have , a gift  --  Cancer is frequently psychic  --  and I feel it 's my duty to use it . But not for money  --  only for my friends . " " You 're lucky to have an independent income . " Her thin-stemmed glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the table . " That 's Gemini for you , " she said . " Always looking for facts . " I felt a slight twinge of doubt and shrugged it off . She 'd fired at random and hit the target by accident . " I did n't mean to be curious , " I said . " Oh , I know that . " She rose suddenly , and I felt the weight of her body standing over me . " Let 's get out of here , Archer . I 'm starting to drop things again . Let 's go some place we can talk . " " Why not ? " She left an unbroken bill on the table and walked out with heavy dignity . I followed her , pleased with my startling sue/cess but feeling a little like a male spider about to be eaten by a female spider . Russell was at his table with his head in his arms . Timothy was yelping at the captain of waiters like a terrier who has cornered some small defenseless animal . The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready in fifteen minutes . In the Hollywood Roosevelt bar she complained of the air and said she felt wretched and old . Nonsense , I told her , but we moved to the Zebra Room . She had shifted to Irish whisky , which she drank straight . In the Zebra Room she accused a man at the next table of looking at her contemptuously . I suggested more air . She drove down Wilshire as if she was trying to break through into another dimension . I had to park the Buick for her at the Ambassador . I 'd left my car at Swift 's . She quarreled with the Ambassador barman on the grounds that he laughed at her when he turned his back . I took her to the downstairs bar at the Huntoon Park , which was n't often crowded . Wherever we went , there were people who recognized her , but nobody joined us or stood up . Not even the waiters made a fuss over her . She was on her way out . Except for a couple leaning together at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deserted . The thickly carpeted , softly lighted basement was a funeral parlor where the eveningwe had killed was laid out . Mrs. Estabrook was pale asp54a corpse , but she was vertical , able to see , talk , drink , and possibly even think . I was steering her in the direction of the Valerio , hoping that she 'd name it . A few more drinks , and I could take the risk of suggesting it myself . I was drinking with her , but not enough to affect me . I made inane conversation , and she did n't notice the difference . I was waiting . I wanted her far enough gone to say whatever came into her head . Archer the heavenly twin and midwife to oblivion . I looked at my face in the mirror behind the bar and did n't like it too well . It was getting thin and predatory-looking . My nose was too narrow , my ears were too close to my head . My eyelids were the kind that overlapped at the outside cornersand made my eyes look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes were like tiny stone wedges hammeredbetween the lids . She leaned forward over the bar with her chin in her hands , looking straight down into her half-empty liqueur glass . The pride that had kept her body erect and organized her face had seeped away . She was hunched there tasting the bitternessat the bottom of her life , droning out elegies : " He never took care of himself , but he had the body of a wrestler and the head of an Indian chief . He was part Indian . Nothing mean about him , though . One sweet guy . Quiet and easy , never talked much . But passionate , and a real one-woman man , the last I ever seen . He got T.B . and went off in one summer . It broke me up . I never got over it since . He was the only man I ever loved . " " What did you say his name was ? " " Bill . " She looked at me slyly . " I did n't say . He was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the valley . We were together for a year , and then he died . That was twenty-five years ago , and I been feeling ever since I might as well be dead myself . " She raised her large tearless eyes and met my glance in the mirror . I wanted to respond to her melancholy look , but I did n't know what to do with my face . I tried smiling to encourage myself . I was a good Joe after all . Consorter with roughnecks , tarts , hard cases and easy marks ; private eye at the keyhole of illicit bedrooms ; informer to jealousy , rat behind the walls , hired gun to anybody with fifty dollars a day ; but a good Joe after all . The wrinkles formed at the corner of my eyes , the wings of my nose ; the lips drew back from the teeth , but there was no smile . All I got was a lean famished look like a coyote 's sneer . The face had seen too many bars , too many rundown hotels and crummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police lineups , too many nerve ends showing like tortured worms . If I found the face on a stranger , I would n't trust it . I caught myself wondering how it looked to Miranda Sampson . " To hell with the three-day parties , " Mrs. Estabrook said . " To hell with the horses and the emeralds and the boats . One good friend is better than any of them , and I have n't got one good friend . Sim Kuntz said he was my friend , and he tells me I 'm making my last picture . I lived my life twenty-five years ago , and I 'm all washed up . You do n't want to get mixed up with me , Archer . " She was right . Still , I was interested , apart from my job . She 'd had a long journey down from a high place , and she knew what suffering was . Her voice had dropped its phony correctness and the other things she had learned from studiop56coaches . It was coarse and pleasantly harsh . It placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the century , on the wrong side of town . She drained her glass and stood up . " Take me home , Archer . " I slid off my stool with gigolo alacrity and took her by the arm . " You ca n't go home like this . You need another drink to snap you back . " " You 're nice . " My skin was thin enough to feel the irony . " Only I ca n't take this place . It 's a morgue . For Christ 's sake , " she yelled at the bartender , " where are all the merrymakers ? " " Are n't you a merrymaker , madam ? " I pulled her away from the start of another quarrel , up the steps and out . There was a light fog in the air , blurring the neons . Above the tops of the buildings the starless sky was dull and low . She shivered , and I felt the tremor in her arm . " There 's a good bar next street up , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it . " " All right . One more drink , then I got to go home . " I opened the door of her car and helped her in . Her breast leaned against my shoulder heavily . I moved back . I preferreda less complicated kind of pillow , stuffed with feathers . not memories and frustrations . The waitress in the Valerio cantina called her by name , escorted us to a booth , emptied the empty ash tray . The bartender , a smooth-faced young Greek , came all the way around from behind the bar to say hello to her and to ask after Mr. Sampson . " He 's still in Nevada , " she said . I was watching her face ,  |p57and  she caught my look . " A very good friend of mine . He stops here when he 's in town . " The two-block ride , or her welcome , had done her good . She was almost sprightly . Maybe I 'd made a mistake . " A great old guy , " the bartender said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful , wonderful man , " said Mrs. Estabrook . " One sweet guy . " The bartender took our order and went away . " Have you cast his horoscope ? " I said . " This friend of yours ? " " Now , how did you know ? He 's Capricorn . One sweet guy , but a very dominant type . He 's had tragedy in his life , though . His only boy was killed in the war . Ralph 's sun was squared by Uranus , you see . You would n't know what that can mean to a Capricornian . " " No . Does it mean much to him ? " " Yes , it does . Ralph has been developing his spiritual side . Uranus is against him , but the other planets are with him . It 's given him courage to know that . " She leaned toward me confidentially . " I wish I could show you the room I redecoratedfor him . It 's in one of the bungalows here , but they would n't let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , he 's in Nevada . He has a very lovely home on the desert . " " Ever been there ? " " You ask so many questions . " She smiled side-eyed in ghastly coquetry . " You would n't be getting jealous ? " " You told me you had no friends . " " Did I say that ? I was forgetting Ralph . "  |p58The  bartender brought our drinks , and I sipped mine . I was facing the back of the room . A door in the wall beside the silent grand piano opened into the Valerio lobby . Alan Taggertand Miranda came through the door together . " Excuse me , " I said to Mrs. Estabrook . Miranda saw me when I stood up , and started forward . I put a finger to my mouth and waved her back with the other hand . She moved away with a wide-mouthed , bewildered look . Alan was quicker . He took her arm and hustled her out the door . I followed them . The bartender was mixing a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't looked up . The door closed behind me . Miranda turned on me . " I do n't understand this . You 're supposed to be looking for Ralph . " " I 'm working on a contact . Go away , please . " " But I 've been trying to get in touch with you . " She was strained to the point of tears . I said to Taggert : " Take her away before she spoils my night 's work . Out of the city , if possible . " Three hours of Fay had sharpened my temper . " But Mrs. Sampson 's been phoning for you , " he said . A Filipino bellboy was standing against the wall hearing everything we said . I took them around the corner into the half-lit lobby . " What about ? " " She 's heard from Ralph . " Miranda 's eyes glowed amber like a deer 's . " A special-delivery letter . He wants her to send him money . Not send it exactly , but have it ready for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars . " " Say that again . "  | " He wants her to cash a hundred thousand dollars ' worth of bonds . " " Does she have that much ? " " She has n't , but she can get it . Bert Graves has Ralph 's power of attorney . " " What 's she supposed to do with the money ? " " He said we 'll hear from him again or he 'll send a messengerfor it . " " You 're sure the letter 's from him ? " " Elaine says it 's in his writing . " " Does he say where he is ? " " No , but the letter 's postmarked Santa Maria . He must have been there today . " " Not necessarily . What does Mrs. Sampson want me to do ? " " She did n't say . I suppose she wants your advice . " " All right , this is it . Tell her to have the money ready , but not to hand it over to anybody without proof that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? " Her hand plucked at the neckline of her dress . " I ca n't afford to guess . " I turned to Taggert . " Can you fly Miranda up tonight ? " " I just phoned Santa Teresa . The airport 's fogged in . First thing in the morning , though . " " Then tell her over the phone . I have a possible lead and I 'm following it up . Graves had better contact the police , quietly . The local police and the Los Angeles police . And Ilse F.B.I . " " The F.B.I. ? " Miranda whispered . " Yes , " I said . " Kidnapping is a federal offense. "  | When I went back to the bar , a young Mexican in a tuxedo was leaning against the piano with a guitar . His small tenor , plaintive and remote , was singing a Spanish bullfighting song . His fingers marched thunderously in the strings . Mrs. Estabrook was watching him and barely noticed me when I sat down . She clapped loudly when the song was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty please . " She handed him a dollar . He bowed and smiled , and returned to his singing . " It 's Ralph 's favorite song , " she said . " Domingo sings it so well . He 's got real Spanish blood in his veins . " " About this friend of yours , Ralph . " " What about him ? " " He would n't object to your being here with me ? " " Do n't be silly . I want you to meet him some time . I know you 'll like him . " " What does he do ? " " He 's more or less retired . He 's got money . " " Why do n't you marry him ? " She laughed harshly . " Did n't I tell you I had a husband ? But you do n't have to worry about him . It 's purely a business proposition . " " I did n't know you were in business . " " Did I say I was in business ? " She laughed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's funny you suggestingI should marry Ralph . We 're both married to other people . Anyway , our friendship is on a different level . You know , more spiritual . "  |p61She  was sobering up on me . I raised my glass . " To friendship . On a different level . " While she was still drinking , I held up two fingers to the waitress . The second drink fixed her . Her face went to pieces as if by its own weight . Her eyes went dull and unblinking . Her mouth hung open in a fixed yawn , the scarlet lips contrasting with the pink-and-white interior . She brought it together numbly and whispered : " I do n't feel so good . " " I 'll take you home . " " You 're nice . " I helped her to her feet . The waitress held the door open , with a condoling smile for Mrs. Estabrook and a sharp glance at me . Mrs. Estabrook stumbled across the sidewalk like an old woman leaning on a cane that was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we made it to the car . Getting her in was like loading a sack of coal . Her head rolled into the corner between the door and the back of the seat . I started the car and headed for Pacific Palisades . The motion of the car revived her after a while . " Got , to get home , " she said dully . " You know where I live ? " " You told me . " " Got to climb on the treadmill in the morning . Crap ! I should weep if he throws me out of pictures . I got independentmeans . " " You look like a businesswoman , " I said encouragingly . " You 're nice , Archer . " The line was beginning to get me down . " Taking care of an old hag like me . You would n't like me if I told you where I got my money . " " Try me . " " But I 'm not telling you . " Her laugh was ugly and loose ,  |p62in  a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but they may have been in my head . " You 're too nice a boy . " Yeah , I said to myself , a clean-cut American type . Always willing to lend a hand to help a lady fall flat on her face in the gutter . The lady passed out again . At least she said nothing more . It was a lonely drive down the midnight boulevard with her half-conscious body . In the spotted coat it was like a sleeping animal beside me in the seat , a leopard or a wildcat heavy with age . It was n't really old  --  fifty at most  --  but it was full of the years , full and fermenting with bad memories . She 'd told me a number of things about herself , but not what I wanted to know , and I was too sick of her to probe deeper . The one sure thing I knew about her she had n't had to tell me : she was bad company for Sampson or any incautious man . Her playmates were dangerous  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sampson she 'd know it or find out . She was awake when I parked in front of her house . " Put the car in the drive . Would you , honey ? " I backed across the road and took the car up the driveway . She needed help to climb the steps to the door , and handed me the key to open it . " You come in . I been trying to think of something I want to drink . " " You 're sure it 's all right ? Your husband ? " Laughter growled in her throat . " We have n't lived together for years . " I followed her into the hallway . It was thick with darkness and her two odors , musk and alcohol , half animal and half human . I felt slippery waxed floor under my feet and won/dered if she 'd fall . She moved in her own house with the blind accuracy of a sleepwalker . I felt my way after her into a room to the left , where she switched on a lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the insane red room she had made for Ralph Sampson . It was big and cheerful even at night behind closed Venetian blinds . A solid middle-class room with post-Impressionist reproductionson the walls , built-in bookshelves , books on them , a radio-phonograph and a record cabinet , a glazed brick fireplace with a heavy sectional chesterfield curved in front of it . The only strangeness was in the pattern of the cloth that covered the chesterfield and the armchair under the lamp : brilliant green tropical plants against a white desert sky , with single eyes staring between the fronds . The pattern changed as I looked at it . The eyes disappeared and reappeared again . I sat down on a batch of them . She was at the portable bar in the corner beside the fireplace . " What are you drinking ? " " Whisky and water . " She brought me my glass . Half of its contents slopped out en route , leaving a trail of dark splotches across the lightgreencarpet . She sat down beside me , depressing the cushionedseat . Her dark head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the few iron-gray strands the hairdresserhad left in her hair so it would n't look dyed . " I ca n't think of anything I want to drink , " she whined . " Do n't let me fall . " I put one arm around her shoulders , which were almost as wide as mine . She leaned hard against me . I felt the stir and swell of her breathing , gradually slowing down . " Do n't try to do anything to me , honey , I 'm dead tonight.  |p64Some  other night . . . . " Her voice was soft and somehow girlish , but blurred . Blurred like the submarine glints of youth in her eyes . Her eyes closed . I could see the faint tremor of her heartbeatin the veins of her withering eyelids . Their fringe of curved dark lashes was a vestige of youth and beauty which made her ruin seem final and hard . It was easier to feel sorry for her when she was sleeping . To make certain that she was , I gently raised one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took away my arm and let her body subside on the cushions . Her breasts hung askew . Her stockings were twisted . She began to snore . I went into the next room , closed the door behind me , and turned on the light . It shone down from the ceiling on a bleached mahogany refectory table with artificial flowers in the center , a china cabinet at one side , a built-in buffet at the other , six heavy chairs ranged around the wall on their haunches . I turned the light off and went into the kitchen , which was neat and well equipped . I wondered for an instant if I had misjudged the woman . There were honest astrologists  --  and plenty of harmless drunks . Her house was like a hundred thousand others in Los Angeles County , almost too typical to be true . Except for the huge garage and the bulldog that guarded it . The bathroom had walls of pastel-blue tile and a square blue tub . The cabinet over the sink was stuffed and heaped with tonics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nembutal , veronal . The hypochondriac bottles and boxes overflowed on the back of the sink , the laundry hamper , and the toilet top . The clothes in the hamperp65were female . There was only one toothbrush in the holder . A razor but no shaving cream , nor any other trace of a man . The bedroom next to the bathroom was flowered and prettied in pink like a prewar sentimental hope . There was a book on the stars on the bedside table . The clothes in the closet were women 's , and there were a great many of them , with Saks and Magnin labels . The undergarments and nightclothesin the chest of drawers were peach and baby blue and black lace . I looked under the twisted mass of stockings in the second drawer and found the core of strangeness in the house . It was a row of narrow packages held together with elastic bands . The packages contained money , all in bills , ones and fives and tens . Most of the bills were old and greasy . If all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drawer was lined with eight or ten thousand dollars . I sat on my heels and looked at all that money . A bedroom drawer was hardly a good place to keep it . But it was safer than a bank for people who could n't declare their income . The burring ring of a telephone cut the silence like a dentist 's drill . It struck a nerve , and I jumped . But I shut the drawer before I went into the hall where the telephone was . There was no sound from the woman in the living-room . I muffled my voice with my tie . " Hello . " " Mr. Troy ? " It was a woman . " Yes . " " Is Fay there ? " Her speech was rapid and clipped . " This is Betty . " " No . " " Listen , Mr. Troy . Fay was fried in the Valerio about an hour ago . The man she was with could be plain-clothes . Hep66said he was taking her home . You would n't want him around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she 's oiled . " " Yes , " I said , and risked : " Where are you now ? " " The Piano , of course . " " Is Ralph Sampson there ? " Her answer was a hiccup of surprise . She was silent for a moment . At the other end of the line I could hear the murmur of people , the clatter of dishes . Probably a restaurant . She recovered her voice : " Why ask me ? I have n't seen him lately ? " " Where is he ? " " I do n't know . ' Who is this talking ? Mr. Troy ? " " Yes . I 'll attend to Fay . " I hung up . The knob of the front door rattled slightly behind me . I froze with my hand on the telephone and watched the cutglassknob as it slowly rotated , sparkling in the light from the living-room . The door swung open suddenly , and a man in a light topcoat stood in the opening . His silver head was hatless . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door neatly with his left hand . His right hand was in the pocket of the topcoat . The pocket was pointed at me . I faced him . " Who are you ? " " I know it is n't polite to answer one question with another . " His voice was softened by a trace of south-of-England accent a long way from home . " But who are you ? " " If this is a stickup ... " The weight in his pocket nodded at me dumbly . He becamemore peremptory . " I asked you a simple question , old chap . Give me a simple answer . "  | " The name is Archer , " I said . " Do you use bluing when you wash your hair ? I had an aunt who said it was very ef-fective . " His face did n't change . He showed his anger by speaking more precisely . " I dislike superfluous violence . Please do n't make it necessary . " I could look down on the top of his head , see the scalp shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " An Italianate Englishman is a devil incarnate . " But the gun in his pocket was a small , intense refrigerating unit cooling off the hallway . His eyes had already turned to ice . " And what do you do for a living , Mr. Archer ? " " I sell insurance . My hobby is stooging for gunmen . " I reached for my wallet to show him my " insurance of all descriptions " card . " No , keep your hands where I can see them . And guard your tongue , wo n't you ? " " Gladly . Do n't expect me to sell you insurance . You 're not a good risk , toting a gun in L. A. " The words went over his head and left it unruffled . " What are you doing here , Mr. Archer ? " " I brought Fay home . " " Are you a friend of hers ? " " Apparently . Are you ? " " I 'll ask the questions . What do you plan to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxi and go home . " " Perhaps you had better do that now , " he said . I picked up the receiver and called a Yellow Cab . He moved toward me lightly . His left hand palpated my chest and armpits , moved down my flanks and hips . I was glad I'd left my gun in the car , but I hated to be touched by him . His hands were epicene . He stepped back and showed me his gun , a nickel-plated revolver , .32 or .38 caliber . I was calculating my chances of kicking him off balance and taking it . His body stiffened slightly , and the gun came into focus like an eye . " No , " he said . " I 'm a quick shot , Mr. Archer . You 'd stand no chance at all . Now turn around . " I turned . He jammed the gun into my back above the kidneys . " Into the bedroom . " He marched me into the lighted bedroom and turned me to face the door . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and shut . The gun came back to my kidneys . " What were you doing in here ? " " I was n't in here . Fay turned on the light . " " Where is she now ? " " In the front room . " He walked me into the room where Mrs. Estabrook was lying , hidden by the back of the chesterfield . She had sunk into a stuporous sleep that resembled death . Her mouth was open , but she was no longer snoring . One of her arms hung down to the floor like an overfed white snake . He looked at her with contempt , the contempt that silver might feel for sodden flesh . " She never could hold her liquor . " " We were pub-crawling , " I said . " We had a wizard do . " He looked at me sharply . " Evidently . Now why should you be interested in a bag of worms like this ? " " You 're talking about the woman I love . " " My wife . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move.  | " Really ? " " I 'm not a jealous man , Mr. Archer , but I must warn you to keep away from her . She has her own small circle of associates , and you simply would n't fit in . Fay 's very tolerant , of course . I am less tolerant . Some of her associates are n't tolerant in the least . " " Are they all as wordy as you ? " He showed his small , regular teeth and subtly changed his posture . His torso leaned , and his head leaned sideways with it , glinting in the light . He was an obscene shape , a vicious boy alert and eager behind an old man 's mask . The gun twirled on his finger like a silver wheel and came to rest pointed at my heart . " They have other ways of expressing themselves . Do I make myself clear ? " " The idea is a simple one to grasp . " The sweat was cold on my back . A car honked in the street . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was warmer outside . " I 'm glad I called in , " the driver said . " Saves me a dry run . I had a long haul out to Malibu . Four pigs called out to a beach party . They 'll never get near the water . " The back of the cab still had a hothouse odor . " You should of heard those women talk . " He slowed for the stop sign at Sunset . " Going back to town ? " " Wait a minute . " He stopped.  | " Do you know of a place called the Piano ? " " The Wild Piano ? " he said . " In West Hollywood . Sort of a bottle joint . " " Who runs it ? " " They never showed me their books , " he said airily , shiftinginto gear . " You want to go there ? " " Why not ? " I said . " The night is young . " I was lying . The night was old and chilly , with a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog-sprinkled black-top . The neons along the Strip glared with insomnia . The night was no longer young at the Wild Piano , but her heartbeat was artificially stimulated . It was on a badly lit sidestreet among a row of old duplexes shouldering each other across garbage-littered alleys . It had no sign , no **27;4456;TOOLONG . An arch of weather-browned stucco , peeling away like scabs , curved over the entrance . Above it a narrow balcony with a wrought iron railing masked heavily curtained windows . A Negro doorman in uniform came out from under the arch and opened the door of the cab . I paid off the driver and followed him in . In the dim light from over the door I could see that the nap of his blue coat was worn down to the bare fiber . The brown leather door had been stained black around the handle by the pressure of many sweating hands . It opened into a deep , narrow room like a tunnel . Another Negro in a waiter 's jacket , a napkin over his arm , came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigo in the blue light that emanated from the walls . The walls were decorated with monochromatic blue nudes in various postures . There were white-clothed tables along them on either side , with an aisle between . A woman was playingp71a piano on a low platform at the far end of the room . She looked unreal through the smoke , a mechanical doll with clever hands and a rigid immovable back . I handed my hat to a hat-check girl in a cubbyhole and asked for a table near the piano . The waiter skidded ahead of me down the aisle , his napkin fluttering like a pennon , trying to create the illusion that business was brisk . It was n't . Two thirds of the tables were empty . The rest were occupied by couples . The men were a representative off-scouring of the better bars , putting off going home . Fat and thin , they were fishfaced in the blue aquarium light , fish-faced and oystereyed . Most of their companions looked paid or willing to be paid . Two or three were blondes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their faces as if they could arrest the passage of time . Several were older women whose pneumatic bodies would keep them afloat for another year or two . These women were working hard with hands , with tongues , with eyes . If they slipped from the level of the Wild Piano , there were worse places to fall to . A Mexican girl with a bored yellow face was sitting by herselfat the table next to mine . Her eyes reached for me , turned away again . " Scotch or bourbon , sir ? " the waiter said . " Bourbon and water . I 'll mix it . " " Yes , sir . We have sandwiches . " I remembered that I was hungry . " Cheese . " " Very good , sir . " I looked at the piano , wondering if I was being too literal . The woman who called herself Betty had said she was at the piano . Its hoarse voice threaded the irregular laughter fromp72the tables in melancholy counterpoint . The pianist 's fingers moved in the keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played itself and she had to keep up with it . Her tense bare shoulders were thin and shapely . Her hair poured down on them like tar and made them seem stark white . Her face was hidden . " Hello , handsome . Buy me a drink . " The Mexican girl was standing by my chair . When I looked up she sat down . Her round-shouldered hipless body moved like a whip . Her low-cut gown was incongruous  --  clothes on a savage . She tried to smile , but her wooden face had never learned that art . " I should buy you a pair of glasses . " She knew it was meant to be funny and that was all . " You are a funny boy . I like a funny boy . " Her voice was guttural and forced , the voice you would expect from a wooden face . " You would n't like me . But I 'll buy you a drink . " She moved her eyes in order to express pleasure . They were solid and unchanging like lumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to stroke it . " I like you , funny boy . Say something funny . " She did n't like me , and I did n't like her . She leaned forward to let me look down her dress . The breasts were little and tight , with pencil-sharp nipples . Her arms and upper lip were furred with black . " On second thought I 'll buy you hormones , " I said . " Is it something to eat ? I am very hungry . " She showed me her hungry white teeth by way of illustration . " Why do n't you take a bite of me ? " " You are kidding me , " she said sulkily . But her hands continuedworking on my arm.  |p73The  waiter appeared and gave me a chance to break loose . He transferred from his tray to the table a small sandwich on a plate , a glass of water , a teacup with a half inch of whisky at the bottom , an empty teapot , and a glass of something he had telepathically brought along for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I beg your pardon . " " Two dollars per drink , sir . Two dollars for the sandwich . " I lifted the upper layer of the sandwich and looked at the slice of cheese it contained . It was as thin as gold leaf and almost as expensive . I put down a ten-dollar bill and left the change on the table . My primitive companion drank her fruit juice , glanced at the four ones , and went back to work on my arm . " You have very passionate hands , " I said ; " only I happen to be waiting for Betty . " " Betty ? " She flung a disdainful black glance at the pianist 's back . " But Betty is arteest . She will not  --  " A gesture finished the sentence . " Betty is the one for me . " Her lips came together with a red tip of tongue protruding as if she was going to spit . I signaled a waiter and ordered a drink for the woman at the piano . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waiter pointed me out when he set down the drink on the piano , and the pianist turned to look . Her face was oval , so small and delicately modeled it looked pinched . Her eyes were indeterminate in color and meaning . She made no effort to smile . I raised my chin by way of invitation . Her head jerked negatively and bent over the keyboard again . I watched her white hands picking their way through thep74artificial boogie-woogie jungle . The music followed them like giant footsteps rustling in metallic undergrowth . You could see the shadow of the giant and hear his trip-hammer heartbeat . She was hot . Then she changed her tune . Her left hand still drummed and rolled in the bass , while her right hand elaborated a blues . She began to sing in a hard , sibilant voice , frayed at the edges but somehow moving : Brain 's in my stomach , Heart 's in my mouth , Want to go northMy feet point south . I got the psychosomatic blues . Doctor , doctor , doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease my painI got the psychosomatic blues . She phrased her song with decadent intelligence . I did n't like it , but it deserved a better audience than the chattering room behind me . I clapped when it ended and ordered her another drink . She brought it to my table and sat down . She had a Tanagra figurine body , small and perfect , poised timelessly somewhere between twenty and thirty . " You like my music , " she stated . She inclined her forehead and looked up at me from under it , the mannerism of a woman proud of her eyes . Their brown-flecked irises were centerless and disturbing . " You should be on Fifty-second Street . " " Do n't think I was n't . But you have n't been there for a while , have you ? The street has gone to the dogs . "  | " There 's no percentage in this place . It 's going to fold . Anybody can see the signs . Who runs it ? " " A man I know . Got a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaled deeply . Her face unconsciouslywaited for the lift and drooped a little when it did n't come . She was a baby with an ageless face , sucking a dry bottle . The rims of her nostrils were bloodless , as white as snow , and that was no Freudian error . " My name is Lew , " I said . " I must have heard of you . " " I 'm Betty Fraley . " The statement had a margin of regret like a thin black border on a card . The name did n't mean anything to me , but it did to her . " I remember you . " I lied more boldly : " You got a tough break , Betty . " All snowbirds wore stigmata of bad luck . " You can say it twice . Two years in a white cell , and no piano . The conspiracy rap was a hummer . All they could prove was I needed it myself . They took me for my own good , they said . Their own good ! They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any more , and if I ever kick the habit , it wo n't be with the help of the feds . " Iler red mouth twisted over the wet red end of the cigarette . " Two years without a piano . " " You do nicely for a girl that 's out of practice . " " You think so ? You should have heard me in Chicago when I was at my peak . I draped the piano over the beams in the ceiling and swung from the keys . You heard my records , maybe . " " Who has n't ? " " Were they like I said ? " " Marvelous ! I 'm crazy about them . "  |p76But  hot piano was n't my dish , and I 'd picked the wrong words or overdone my praise . The bitterness of her mouth spread to her eyes and voice . " I do n't believe you . Name one . " " It 's been a long time . " " Did you like my Gin Mill Blues ? " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it better than Sul-livan . " " You 're a liar , Lew . I never recorded that number . Why would you want to make me talk too much ? " " I like your music . " " Yeah . You 're probably tone-deaf . " She looked intently into my face . The mutable eyes had hard , bright diamond centers . " You could be a cop , you know . You 're not the type , but there 's something about the way you look at things , wantingthem but not liking them . You got cop 's eyes  --  they want to see people hurt . " " Take it easy , Betty . You 're only half psychic . I do n't like to see people hurt , but I 'm a cop . " " Narcotics ? " Her face was brushed by white terror . " Nothing like that . A private cop . I do n't want anything from you . I just happen to like your music . " " You lie . " In spite of her hatred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry rustle . " You 're the one that answered Fay 's phone and said you were Troy . What do you think you 're after ? " " A man called Sampson . Do n't tell me you have n't heard of him . You have . " " I never heard of him . " " That 's not what you said on the phone . " " All right , I 've seen him in here like anybody else . Doesp77that make me his nurse ? Why come to me ? He 's just another flybar in my book . " " You came to me . Remember ? " She leaned toward me , projecting hatred like a magnetic field . " Get out of here and stay out . " " I 'm staying . " " You think . " She jerked a taut white hand at the waiter , who came running . " Call Puddler . This jerk 's a private cop . " He looked at me with uncertainty tugging at his blue-black face . " Take it easy , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the piano . " Puddler ! " Every head in the room jerked up . The door sprang open , and the man in the scarlet shirt came out . His small eyes moved from side to side , looking for trouble . She pointed a finger at me . " Take him out and work him over . He 's a peeper , trying to pump me . " I had time to run , but I lacked the inclination . Three runoutswere too many in one day . I went to meet him and took the sucker punch . The scarred head rolled away easily . I tried with my right . He caught it on the forearm and moved in . His dull eyes shifted . I had the funny feeling that they did n't recognize me . One fist came into my stomach . I dropped my guard . The other came into my neck below the ear . My legs were caught by the edge of the platform . I fell against the piano . Consciousness went out in jangling discord , swallowed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a futilelittle man was sitting with his back against something hard . Something equally hard was hitting him in the face . First on one side of the jaw , then on the other . Every time this happened his head bounced once against the hard surface behind him . This distressing sequence  --  the blow followed by the bounce  --  continued with monotonous regularity for a considerable period of time . Each time the fist approached his jaw the futile man snapped at it futilely with his aching teeth . His arms , however , hung peacefully at his sides . His legs were remarkably inert and distant . A tall shadow appeared at the mouth of the alley , stood one-legged like a stork for an instant , then limped grotesquely toward us . Puddler was too absorbed in his work to notice . The shadow straightened up behind him and swung one arm high in the air . The arm came down with a dark object swinging at the end of it . It made a cheerful sound , like cracking walnuts , on the back of Puddler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't read his soul in his eyes because only the whites were showing . I pushed him over backward . Alan Taggert put his shoe on and squatted beside me . " We better get out of here . I did n't hit him very hard . " " Let me know when you 're going to hit him hard . I want to be present . " My lips felt puffed . My legs were like remote and rebellious colonies of my body . I established mandates over them and got to my feet . It was just as well I could n't stand on one of them . I would have kicked the man on the pavement and regretted it later  --  several years later.  |p79Taggert  took hold of my arm and pulled me toward the mouth of the alley . A taxi with one door open was standing at the curb . Across the street the stucco entrance of the Wild Piano was deserted . He pushed me into the cab and got in after me . " Where do you want to go ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger surged into the vacuum . " Home to bed , but I 'm not going . Swift 's on Hollywood Boulevard . " " They 're closed , " the driver said . " My car 's in their parking lot . " And my gun was in the car . We were halfway there before my brain caught up with my tongue . " Where in hell did you come from ? " I said to Taggert . " Out of the everywhere into the here . " I snarled at him : " Do n't double-talk . I 'm not in the mood . " " Sorry , " he said seriously . " I was looking for Sampson . There 's a place back there called the Wild Piano . Sampson took me there once , and I thought I 'd ask them about him . " " That 's what I thought I 'd do . You saw the answer they gave me . " " How did you happen to go there ? " I could n't be bothered explaining . " I stumbled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you coming out , " he said . " Did I walk out ? " " More or less . You had some help . I waited in the taxi to see what gave . When the bruiser took you into the alley I came in after you . "  | " I have n't thanked you , " I said . " Do n't bother . " He leaned toward me and said in an earnest whisper : " You really think Sampson 's been kid-napped ? " " I 'm not thinking so well just now . It 's one idea I had when I was having ideas . " " Who would have kidnapped him ? " " There 's a woman named Estabrook , " I said , " a man named Troy . Ever meet him ? " " No , but I 've heard of the Estabrook woman . She was with Sampson in Nevada a couple of months ago . " " In what capacity ? " My bruised face felt like leering . I let it leer . " I would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane was out of commission , and I was in Los Angeles with it . I never got to see her , but Sampson mentioned her to me . As far as I could tell , they sat around in the sun talking about religion . I think she 's a sidekick of this holy man Claude . The one Sampson gave the mountain to . " " You should have told me before . That was her picture I showed you . " " I did n't know that . " " It does n't matter now . I spent the evening with her . She was the woman I was with in the Valerio . " " She was ? " He seemed astonished . " Does she know where Sampson is ? " " It 's possible she does , but she was n't saying . I 'm going to pay her another visit now . And I could use some help . Her household is a rather violent one . " " Good ! " said Taggert . My reactions were still too slow , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all went well until we got to the Estabrook house . It was dark . The Buick was gone from the driveway , and the garage was empty . I knocked on the front door with the muzzle of my gun . No answer . " She must have gotten suspicious , " Taggert said . " We 'll break in . " But the door was bolted and too strong for our shoulders . We went around to the back . In the yard I stumbled over a smooth , round object that turned out to be a beer bottle . " Steady there , old man , " Taggert said in a Rover Boy way . He seemed to be enjoying himself . Ile flung himself with youthful abandon against the kitchen door . When we pushed together it splintered at the lock and gave . We went through the kitchen into the dark hall . " You 're not carrying a gun ? " I said . " No . " " But you know how to use one . " " Naturally . I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him my automatic . " Make do with this . " I went to the front door , pulled back the bolt , and opened it a crack . " If anybody comes let me know . Do n't show your-self . " He took up his position with great solemnity , like a new sentry at Buckingham Palace . I went the rounds of the living-room , the dining-room , the kitchen , the bathroom , turning lights on and off . Those rooms were as I had seen them last . The bedroom was slightly different . The difference was that the second drawer had nothing but stockings in it . And a used envelope , torn and empty , which was crumpled in a corner behind the stockings . The envelope was addressed to Mrs. Estabrook at the address I was visiting.  |p82Someone  had scrawled some words and figures in pencil on the back : " Avge. gross $2000 . Avge. expense ( Max ) $500 . Avge. net $100 . May  --  1500 X 31-46,500 less 6,5oo ( emerg. ) 40,000-40,000. 2 = 20,000 . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing I knew for sure : the Wild Piano was n't making that kind of money . I turned the envelope over again . It was dated April 30 , a week before , and postmarked Santa Maria . While that was sinking in , I heard a heavy motor growling in the road . I snapped off the light and moved into the hall . A wave of light washed over the front of the house , poured in at the crack of the door where Taggert was standing . " Archer ! " he whispered hoarsely . Then he did a bold and foolish thing . He stepped out onto the porch , in the full white glare , and fired the gun in his hand . " Hold it , " I said , too late . The bullet rapped metal and whined away in richochet . There was no answering shot . I elbowed past him and plunged down the front steps . A truck with a closed van was backing out of the drive in a hurry . I sprinted across the lawn and caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . The window was open on the right side of the cab . I hooked my arm through it and braced one foot on the fender . A thin white cadaver 's face turned toward me over the wheel , its small frightened eyes gleaming . The truck stopped as if it had struck a stone wall . I lost my grip and fell in the road . The truck backed away , changed gears with a grinding clash , and came toward me while I was still on my knees . The bright lights hypnotized me for a second . The roaring wheelsp83bore down on me . I saw their intention and flung myself sideways , rolled to the curb . The truck passed ponderously over the place in the road where I had been , and went on up the street , the roar of its motor mounting in pitch and volume . Its license plate , if it had one , was n't lighted . The back doors were windowless . When I reached my car Taggert had started the engine . I pushed him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of sight when we reached Sunset . There was no way of knowing whether it had turned toward the mountains or toward the sea . I turned to Taggert , who was sitting rather forlornly with the gun in his lap . " Hold your fire when I tell you to . " " It was too late when you told me . I aimed over the driver 's head , anyway , to force him out of the cab . " " He tried to run me down . He would n't have got away if you could be trusted with firearms . " " I 'm sorry , " he said contritely . " I guess I was trigger happy . " He handed me the gun , butt foremost . " Forget it . " I turned left toward the city . " Did you get a good look at the truck ? " " I think it was army surplus , the kind they used for carryingpersonnel . Painted black , was n't it ? " " Blue . What about the driver ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wearing a peaked cap , that 's all I could see . " " You did n't see his front plate ? " " I do n't think there was any . " " That 's too bad , " I said . " It 's barely possible Sampson was in that truck . Or has been . " " Really ? Do you think we should go to the police ? "  | " I think we should . But first I 'll have to talk to Mrs. Sampson . Did you phone her ? " " I could n't get her . She was out with sleeping pills when I called her back . She ca n't sleep without them . " " I 'll see her in the morning , then . " " Are you going to fly up with us ? " " I 'll drive up . There 's something I want to do first . " " What 's that ? " " A little private business , " I said flatly . He was silent after that . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The murky red cloud over the city was turning pale at the edges . The late-night traffic of cabs and private cars had dwindled to almost nothing , and the earlymorningtrucks were beginning to roll . I watched for a blue army surplus truck with a closed van and did n't see one . I dropped Taggert at the Valcrio and went home . A quart of milk was waiting on my doorstep . I took it in for company . The electric clock in the kitchen said twenty after four . I found a box of frozen oysters in the freezing compartment of the refrigerator and made an oyster stew . My wife had never liked oysters . Now I could sit at my kitchen table at any hour of the day or night and eat oysters to my heart 's content , building up my virility . I undressed and got into bed without looking at the empty twin bed on the other side of the room . In a way it was a relief not to have to explain to anyone what I had been doing all day. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peter Colton was at the flat-topped desk in his office . He had been my colonel in Intelligence . When I opened the ground-glass door he glanced up sharply from a pile of police reports , then lowered his eyes immediately to show that I was n't welcome . He was a senior investigator in the D.A . ' s office , a heavy middle-aged man with cropped fair hair and a violent nose like the prow of a speedboat inverted . His office was a plaster cubicle with a single steel-framed window . I made myself uncomfortable on a hard-backed chair against the wall . After a while he pointed his nose at me . " What happened to that which , for want of a better term , I choose to call your face ? " " I got into an argument . " " And you want me to arrest the neighborhood bully . " His smile dragged down the corners of his mouth . " You 'll have to fight your own battles , my little man , unless of course there 's something in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sourly , " and three sticks of bubble gum . " " You attempt to bribe the forces of the law with three sticks of bubble gum ? Do n't you realize that this is the atomic age , my friend ?

" " And you think I have nothing better to do with my time than to go about putting the arm on berserk pianos ? Or put/ting on a vaudeville act with a run-down divorce detective ?

" It smells like a snatch to me . Could be my nostrils are insensate . What does the hot sheet say ? " " No black limousines in the last seventy-two hours . People with limousines look after them .

" You 'll be getting it through official channels . Then it 's out of my hands . In the meantime you can be doing some-thing . " " For you ? " " For yourself . Start checking the car-rental agencies . That 's number two . Number three is the Wild Piano  --  " " That 's enough . " He flapped his hands in front of his face .

" There 's an awful lot of car rentals in the county . " " I 'd do it myself but I have to go out of town . These people live in Santa Teresa . " " And their name ? " " Can I trust you ? " " Some . Further than you can see me . " " Sampson , " I said . " Ralph Sampson . " " I 've heard of him . And I see what you mean about the hundred grand . " " The trouble is we ca n't be sure what happened to him . We 've got to wait . " " That 's what you said . " He swung on his heel to the win/the room .

" " I thought there were laws against places like that . And people like him . Excuse my ignorance . " " You know who he is , then ? " " If he 's a white-haired Englishman , yes . " Colton nodded his head . " I met him once . He waved a gun at me for some reason . I left . It was n't my job to take his gun away . " Colton moved his thick shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years . He 's smooth and versatile . He goes just so far in a racket , until his protection wears thin , then he shifts to something else . He rode high in the early thirties , running liquor from Baja California until that petered out . Since then he 's had his ups and downs . He had a gambling pitch in Nevada for a while , but the syndicateforced him out . His pickings have been slender lately , I hear , but we 're still waiting to take him . " " While you 're waiting , " I said , with heavy irony , " you could close the Wild Piano . " " We close it every six months , " he snapped . " You should have seen it before the last raid , when it was the Rhinestone.  |p89They  had a one-way window upstairs for voyeurs and masochists , a regular act of a woman whipping a man , and such stuff . We put an end to that . " " Who ran it then ? " " A woman by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She was n't even prosecuted . " He snorted angrily . " I ca n't do anything about conditions like that .

But he and Sampson have been moving in some of the same circles . You 'd be smart to put a man on the Wild Piano . " " If we can spare one . " He moved toward me unexpectedly and put a heavy hand on my shoulder . " If you meet Troy again , do n't try to take his gun . It 's been tried . " " Not by me . " " No , " he said . " The men that tried it are dead . " It was a two-hour drive at sixty fromLos Angeles to Santa Teresa . The sun was past its zenith when I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds that made moving shadows on the terraces . Felix admitted me and led me through the house to the living-room . It was so big the heavy furniture seemed sparse . The wall that faced the sea was a single sheet of glass , with spun-glass curtains at each end like gathered lengths of light . Mrs. Samp/son was a life-size doll propped in a padded chair beside the giant window . She was fully dressed , in lime-colored silk jersey . Her gold-shod feet rested on a footstool . Not a hair of her bleached head was out of place . The metal wheelchair was beside the door . She was motionless and silent , making a deliberate tableau that verged on the ridiculous as the seconds passed . When the silence had twisted my arm for a quarter of a minute , " Very nice , " I said . " You were trying to get in touch with me ? " " You 've taken your time about coming . " The voice of the still mahogany face was petulant . " I ca n't apologize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I relayed my advice to you . Have you taken it ? " " In part . Come closer , Mr. Archer , and sit down . I 'm perfectlyharmless , really . " She indicated an armchair facing her own . I moved across the room to it . " Which part ? " " All of me , " she said , with the carnivore smile . " My sting has been removed . But of course you mean the advice . Bert Graves is attending to the money now . " " Has he seen the police ? " " Not yet . I want to discuss that with you . But first you 'd better read the letter . " She picked up an envelope from the coffee table beside her and tossed it to me . I took out the empty envelope I 'd found in Mrs. Estabrook 's drawer and compared the two . They differedin size and quality and the handwriting of the address . The only similarity was in the Santa Maria postmark . Sampson'sletter was addressed to Mrs. Sampson and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you get it ? " " About nine o'clock last night . It 's special delivery , as you can see . Read it .

There are a number of bonds in our joint safety deposit box at the Bank of America . Albert Graves can identify those that are negotiableand arrange to have them cashed . I want you to cash bonds for me to the value of one hundred thousand dollars . I want no bills larger than fifties and hundreds . Do not permit the bank to mark them or record the numbers , since the deal I mentioned is confidential and highly important . Keep the money in my safe at home until you hear from me again , as you shortly will , or untilI send a messenger bearing a letter of identification from me . You will have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of the outmost importance that you should not tell anyone else about this business . If you do , I stand to lose a very large profit and might even find myself on the wrong side of the law . It must be kept completely secret from everyone . That is why I am asking you to obtain the money for me , instead of going directly to my bank . I will be finished with this business within the week , and will see you soon . My best love , and do n't worry . Ralph Sampson.  | " It 's carefully done , " I said , " but not convincing . The reason he gives for not going to the bank himself sounds pretty weak . What does Graves think of it ? " " He pointed that out , too . He thinks it 's a put-up job . But , as he says , it 's my decision . " " Are you absolutely certain this is your husband 's writ-ing ? " " There 's no doubt about that . And did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his favorite words , and he always misspells it . He even pronounces it outmost . ' Ralph is n't a cultivated man . " " The question is , is he a living one ? " Her level blue eyes turned to me with dislike . " Do you really think it 's as serious as that , Mr. Archer ? " " He does n't normally do business like this , does he ? " " I know nothing about his ways of doing business . Actually he retired from business when we were married . He bought and sold some ranches during the war , but he did n't confide the details of the transactions to me . " " Have any of his transactions been illegal ? " " I simply do n't know . He 's perfectly capable of it . It 's one of the things that ties my hands . " " What are the others ? " " I do n't trust him , " she said thinly . " I have no way of knowing what he intends to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip around the world . Perhaps he intends to leave me . I do n't know . " " I do n't either , but this is my guess . Your husband is being held for ransom . He wrote this letter from dictation with a gun at his head . If it was really a business deal , he 'd have no reason to write to you . Graves has his power of attorney . Butp93kidnappers prefer to deal with the victim 's wife . It makes things easier for them . " " What am I going to do ? " she said , in a strained voice . " Follow instructions to the letter , except that you should bring in the police . Not in an obvious or public way , but so they 'll be standing by . You see , Mrs. Sampson , the easy way for kidnappers to dispose of a victim , after the money 's been collected , is to blow his brains out and leave him . He 's got to be found before that happens , and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been kidnapped . Have you found out anything you have n't told me ? " " Quite a few things . They add up to the fact that your husband 's been keeping bad company . " " I knew it . " Her face slipped out of control for an instant , sprang into curves of triumph . " He loves to pose as a family man and a good father , but he 's never fooled me . " " Very bad company , " I said heavily . " As bad as there is in Los Angeles , and that 's as bad as there is . " " He 's always had a taste for low companions  --  " She broke off suddenly , raising her eyes to the door behind me . Miranda was standing there . ' Wearing a gray gabardine suit that emphasized her height , her copper hair swept up on top of her head , she looked like an older sister of the girl I 'd met the day before . But her eyes were wide with fury , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare to say that about my father ! He may be dying , and all you care about is proving something against him . " " Is that all I care about , dear ? " The brown face was impassiveagain . Only the pale eyes moved , and the carefully painted mouth . " Do n't dear ' me . " Miranda strode toward us . Even inp94anger her body had the grace of a young cat . She showed her claws . " All you really care about is yourself . If I ever saw a narcissist , you 're one , Elaine . With your precious vanity , your primping , and your curling , and your special hairdresser , and your diet  --  it 's all for your own benefit , is n't it ?  --  so you can go on loving yourself . You surely do n't expect anyone else to love you . " " Not you , certainly , " the older woman said coolly . " The thought repels me . But what do you care about , my dear ? Alan Taggert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Miranda . " " I did n't . You lie . " She was standing over her stepmother with her back to me . I was embarrassed , but I stayed where I was , balanced on the edge of my chair . I 'd seen verbal cat fights end in violence more than once . " Did Alan stand you up again ? When is he going to many you ? " " Never ! I would n't have him . " Miranda 's voice was breaking . She was too young and vulnerable to stand the quarrel for long . " It 's easy for you to make fun of me ; you 've never cared for anyone . You 're frigid , that 's what you are . My father would n't be God knows where if you 'd given him any love . You made him come out here to California , away from all his friends , and now you 've driven him away from his own house . " " Nonsense ! " But Mrs. Sampson too was showing the strain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've hated me from the beginning and sided against me whether I was right or wrong . Your brother was fairer to me  --  " " You leave Bob out of this . I know you had him underp95your thumb , but it 's no credit to you . It pleased your vanity , did n't it , to have your stepson dancing attendance ? " " That 's enough , " Mrs. Sampson said hoarsely . " Go away , you wretched girl . " Miranda did n't move , but she fell silent . I turned in my seat and looked out the window . Below the terraced lawn a stone walk led out to a pergola that stood on the edge of the bluff overlooking the sea . It was a small octagonal building with a conical roof , completely walled with glass . Through it and beyond it I could see the shifting colors of the ocean : green and white where the surf began , sage-honey-colored in the kelp zone further out , then deep-water blue to the deepsky-bluehorizon . My eye was caught by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves began to break . A little black disk skimmed out along the surface , skipped from wave to wave , and sank out of sight . Another followed it a moment later . The source of the skimming objects was too near shore to be seen , hidden by the steep fall of the cliff . When six or seven had skipped along the water and disappeared , there were no more . Unwillingly I turned to the silent room . Miranda was still standing above the other woman 's chair , but her posture had altered . Her body had come unstarched . One of her hands was lifted from her side toward her stepmother , not in anger . " I 'm sorry , Elaine . " I could n't see her face . Mrs. Sampson 's was visible . It was hard and clever . " You hurt me , " she said . " You ca n't expect me to forgive you . " " You hurt me too , " with a sobbing rhythm . " You must n't throw Alan in my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . No , I do n't really mean that , and you know it . I think you ought to marry him . You want to , do n't you ? " " Yes . But you know how father feels about it . Not to mentionAlan . " " You take care of Alan , " Mrs. Sampson said , almost gaily , " and I 'll take care of your father . " " Will you really ? " " I give you my word . Now please go away , Miranda . I 'm dreadfully tired . " She glanced at me . " All this must have been very instructive to Mr. Archer . " " I beg your pardon ? " I said . " I was admiring your private view . " " Yes , lovely , is n't it ? " She called to Miranda , who had started out of the room : " Stay if you wish , dear . I 'm going upstairs . " She lifted a silver handbell that stood on the table beside her . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round . Miranda completed the picture by sitting down , with her face averted , in a far corner of the room . " You 've seen us at our worst , " Mrs. Sampson said to me . " Please do n't judge us by it . I 've decided to do as you say . " " Shall I call the police ? " " Bert Graves will do it . He 's familiar with all the Santa Teresa authorities . He should be here any minute . " Mrs. Kromberg , the housekeeper , entered the room and wheeled the rubber-tired chair across the carpet . Almost effortlesslyshe raised Mrs. Sampson in her arms and placed her in the chair . They left the room in silence . An electric motor murmured somewhere in the house as Mrs. Sampson ascended toward heaven.  | I sat down beside Miranda on thedivan in the corner of the room . She refused to look at me . " You must think we 're terrible people , " she said . " To fight like that in public . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't really know . Elaine can be so sweet at times , but she 's always hated me , I think . Bob was her pet . He was my brother , you know . " " Killed in the war ? " " Yes . He was everything I 'm not . Strong and controlled and good at everything he tried . They gave him the Navy Cross posthumously . Elaine worshipped the ground he walked on . I used to wonder if she was in love with him . But of course we all loved him . Our family 's been quite differentsince he died and since we came out here . Father 's gone to pieces , and Elaine 's come up with this fake paralysis , and I 'm all mixed up . But I 'm talking much too much , are n't I ? " The turning of her half-averted head to me was a lovely gesture . Her mouth was soft and tremulous , her large eyes were blind with thought . " I do n't mind . " " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to , you see . I used to think I was lucky , with all of father 's money behind me . I was an arrogant little bitch  --  maybe I still am . But I 've learned that money can cut you off from people . We have n't got what it takes for the Santa Teresa social life , the international-Hollywood set , and we have no friends here . I suppose I should n't blame Elaine for that , but she was thep98one that insisted we come here to live during the war . My mistake was leaving school . " " Where did you go ? " " Radcliffe . I did n't fit in too well , but I had friends in Boston . They fired me for insubordination last year . I should have gone back . They would have taken me , but I was too proud to apologize . Too arrogant . I thought I could live with father , and he tried to be good to me , but it did n't work out . He has n't got along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . And now something 's happened to him . " " We 'll get him back , " I said . But I felt that I should hedge . " Anyway , you have other friends . Alan and Bert , for example . " " Alan does n't really care for me . I thought he did once  --  no , I do n't want to talk about him . And Bert Graves is n't my friend . He wants to marry me , and that 's quite different . You ca n't relax with a man that wants to marry you . " " He loves you , by all the signs . " " I know he does . " She raised her round , proud chin . " That 's why I ca n't relax with him . And why he bores me . " " You 're asking for a hell of a lot , Miranda . " And I was talking a hell of a lot , talking like somebody out of Miles Standish . " Things never work out quite perfectly no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an egotist . Some day you 'll come down to earth so hard you 'll probably break your neck . Or fracture your ego , anyway , I hope . " " I told you I was an arrogant bitch , " she said , too lightly and easily . " Is there any charge for the diagnosis ? " " Do n't go arrogant on me now . You already have once . " She opened her eyes very wide in demure parody . " Kissing you yesterday ? "  | " I wo n't pretend I did n't like it . I did . But it made me mad . I resent being used for other people 's purposes . " " And what were my sinister purposes ? " " Not sinister . Sophomore stuff . You should be able to think of better ways to fascinate Taggert . " " Leave him out of this . " Her tone was sharp , but then she softened it . " Did it make you very mad ? " " This mad . " I took hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Her mouth was half open and hot . Her body was cool and firm from breast to knee . She did n't struggle . Neitherdid she respond . " Did you get any satisfaction out of that ? " she said , when I released her . I looked into her wide green eyes . They were candid and steady , but they had murky depths . I wondered what went on in those sea depths , and how long it had been going on . " It salved my ego . " She laughed . " It salved your lips , at least . There 's lipstick on them . " I wiped my mouth with my handkerchief . " How old are you ? " " Twenty . Old enough for your sinister purposes . Do you think I act like a child ? " " You 're a woman . " I looked at her body deliberately  --  round breasts , straight flanks , round hips , straight round legs  --  until she squirmed . " That involves certain responsibili-ties . " " I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't fling myself around . You 've seen a lot of life , have n't you ? "  |p100It  was a girlish question , but I answered her seriously . " Too much , of one kind . I make my living seeing a lot of life . " " I guess I have n't seen enough . I 'm sorry for making you mad . " She leaned toward me suddenly and kissed my cheek very lightly . I felt a letdown , because it was the kind of kiss a niece might give to an uncle . Well , I had fifteen years on her . The letdown did n't last . Bert Graves had twenty . There was the sound of a car in the drive , then movement in the house . " That must be Bert now , " she said . We were standing well apart when he entered the room . But he gave me a single glance , veiled and questioning and hurt , before he found control of his face . Even then there were vertical lines of anxiety between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he moved with speed and decision , cat-footed for a heavy man . His body , at least , was glad to get into action . He said hello to Miranda and turned to me . " What do you say , Lew ? " " Did you get the money ? " He took the calfskin brief case from under his arm , unlockedit with a key , and dumped its contents on the coffee table  --  a dozen or more oblong packages wrapped in brown bank paper and tied together with red tape . " One hundred thousand dollars , " he said . " A thousand fifties and five hundred hundreds . God knows what we 're going to do with it . " " Put it in the safe for now . There 's one in the house , is n't there ? " " Yes , " Miranda said . " In father 's study . The combination 's in his desk . "  | " And another thing . You need protection for this money and the people in this house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " What about you ? " " I 'm not going to be here . Get one of the sheriff 's deputies to come out . It 's what they 're for . " " Mrs. Sampson would n't let me call them . " " She will now . She wants you to turn the whole thing over to the police . " " Good ! She 's getting some sense . I 'll put this stuff away and get on the phone . " " See them in person , Bert . " " Why ? " " Because , " I said , " this has some of the earmarks of an inside job . Somebody in this house could be interested in the conversation . " " You 're ahead of me , but I see what you mean . The letter shows inside knowledge , which they might or might not have got from Sampson . Assuming there is a they , ' and he has been kidnapped . " " We 'll work on that assumption till another turns up . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't afford to frighten them . Not if we want Sampson alive . " " I understand that . But where are you going to be ? " " This envelope is postmarked Santa Maria . " I did n't bother telling him about the other envelope in my pocket . " There 's a chance he may be there on legitimate business . Or illegitimatebusiness , for that matter . I 'm going there . " " I 've never heard of his doing any business there . Still , it might be worth looking into . " " Have you tried the ranch ? " Miranda said to Graves.  | " I called the superintendent this morning . They have n't heard from him . " " What ranch is that ? " I said . " Father has a ranch on the other side of Bakersfield . A vegetable ranch . He would n't be likely to go there now , though , on account of the trouble . " " The field workers are out on strike , " Graves said . " They 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some violence . It 's a nasty situation . " " Could it have anything to do with this one ? " " I doubt it . " " You know , " Miranda said , " he may be at the Temple . When he was there before , his letters came through Santa Maria . " " The Temple ? " Once or twice before , I 'd caught myself slipping off the edge of the case into a fairy tale . It was one of the occupational hazards of working in California , but it irked me . " The Temple in the Clouds , the place he gave to Claude . Father spent a couple of days there in the early spring . It 's in the mountains near Santa Maria . " " And who , " I said , " is Claude ? " " I told you about him , " Graves said . " The holy man he gave the mountain to . He 's made the lodge over into some kind of a temple . " " Claude 's a phony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair long and never cuts his beard and talks like a bad imitation of Walt Whitman . " " Have you been up there ? " I asked her . " I drove Ralph up , but I left when Claude started to talk.  |p103I  could n't bear him . He 's a dirty old goat with a foghorn voice and the nastiest eyes I ever looked into . " " How about taking me there now ? " " All right . I 'll put on a sweater . " Graves ' mouth moved silently as if he was going to protest . He watched her anxiously as she left the room . " I 'll bring her home safely , " I said . I should have held my tongue . He moved toward me with his head down like a bull 's , a big man and still hard . His arms were stiff at his sides . The fists were clenched at the end of them . " Listen to me , Archer , " he said in a monotone . " Wipe the lipstick off your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tried to cover my embarrassment with a smile . " I 'd take you , Bert . I 've had a lot of practice handling jealous males . " " That may be . But keep your hands off Miranda , or I 'll spoil your good looks . " I rubbed my left cheek where Miranda had left her mark . " Do n't get her wrong  --  " " I suppose it was Mrs. Sampson you were playing kissing games with ? " He uttered a small heartbroken laugh . " No soap ! " " It was Miranda , and it was n't a game . She was feeling low and I talked to her and she kissed me once . It did n't mean a thing . Purely a filial kiss . " " I 'd like to believe you , " he said uncertainly . " You know how I feel about Miranda . " " She told me . " " What did she say ? " " That you were in love with her . "  | " I 'm glad she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me when she 's feeling low . " He smiled bitterly . " How do you do it , Lew ? " " Do n't come to me with your heart problems . I 'll foul you up for sure . I have one little piece of advice , though . " " Shoot . " " Take it easy , " I said . " Just take it easy . We 've got a big job on our hands and we 've got to pull together . I 'm no threat to your love life and I would n't be if I could . And while I 'm being blunt , I do n't think Taggert is , either . He simply is n't interested . " " Thanks , " he said in a harsh , forced voice . He was n't the kind of man who went in for intimate confessions . But he added miserably : " She 's so much younger than I am . Taggert has youth and looks . " There was a soft plopping of feet in the hall outside the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue . " Did somebody take my name in vain ? " He was naked except for wet bathing trunks , wide-shouldered , narrow-waisted and long-legged . With the wet dark hair curling on his small skull , the lazy smile on his face , he could have posed for the Greeks as a youthful god . Bert Graves looked him over with dislike and said slowly : " I was just telling Archer how handsome I thought you were . " The smile contracted slightly but stayed on his face . " That sounds like a left-handed compliment , but what the hell ! Hello , Archer , anything new ? " " No , " I said . " And I was telling Graves that you 're not interested in Miranda . " " Right you are , " he answered airily . " She 's a nice girl butp105not for me . Now if you 'll excuse me I 'll put on some clothes . " " Gladly , " Graves said . But I called him back : " Wait a minute . Do you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .32 's . " " Load one and keep it on you , eh ? Stick around the house and keep your eyes open . Try not to be trigger-happy . " " I learned my lesson , " he said cheerfully . " Do you expect something to break ? " " No , but if something does , you 'll want to be ready . Will you do what I said ? " " I sure will . " " He 's not a bad kid , " Graves said , when he was gone , " but I ca n't stand the sight of him . It 's funny ; I 've never been jealousbefore . " " Ever been in love before ? " " Not until now . " He stood with his shoulders bowed , burdenedby fatality and exaltation and despair . IIe was in love for the first time and for keeps . I was sorry for him . " Tell me , " he said , " what was Miranda feeling low about ? This business of her father ? " " Partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . She needs some sort of steady backing . " " I know she does . It 's one reason I want to marry her . There are other reasons , of course ; I do n't have to tell you that . " " No , " I said . I risked a candid question . " Is money one of them ? " He glanced at me sharply . " Miranda has no money of her own . " " She will have , though ? " " She will have , naturally , when her father dies . I wrote hisp106will for him , and she gets half . I do n't object to the money  --  " he smiled wryly "  --  but I 'm not a fortune-hunter , if that 's what you mean . " " It is n't . She might come into that money sooner than you think , though . The old man 's been running in some fast and funny circles in L. A. Did he ever mention a Mrs. Estabrook ? Fay Estabrook ? Or a man called Troy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character is he , anyway ? " " A gunman , " I said . " I 've heard that he 's done murders . " " I 'm not surprised . I tried to tell Sampson to keep awayfrom Troy , but Sampson thinks he 's fine . " " Have you met Troy ? " " Sampson introduced me to him in Las Vegas a couple of months ago . The three of us went the rounds , and a lot of people seemed to know him . All the croupiers knew him , if that 's a recommendation . " " It is n't . But he had his own place in Las Vegas at one time . He 's done a lot of things . And I do n't think kidnapping would be beneath his dignity . How did Troy happen to be with Sampson ? " " I got the impression that he worked for Sampson , but I could n't be sure . He 's a queer fish . He watched me and Sampson gamble , but he would n't himself . I dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To him that hath shall be given . " He smiled ruefully . " Maybe Troy was making a good impression , " I said . " Maybe . The bastard gave me the creeps . Do you think he 's mixed up in this ? " " I 'm trying to find out , " I said . " Does Sampson need money , Bert ? " " Hell , no ! He 's a millionaire . "  | " Why would he go into business with a jerk like Troy ? " " The time hangs heavy on his hands . The royalties roll in from Texas and Oklahoma , and he gets bored . Sampson 's a natural money-maker the way I 'm ' a natural money-loser . He 's not happy unless he 's making it ; I 'm not happy unless I 'm losing it . " He broke off short when Miranda entered the room . " Ready ? " she said . " Do n't worry about me , Bert . " She pressed his shoulder with her hand . Her light-brown coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed like weapons , were half impatient promise , half gradual threat . She had let down her hair and brushed it behind her ears . Her bright face slanted toward him like a challenge . He kissed her cheek lightly and tenderly . I still felt sorry for him . He was a strong , intelligent man , but he looked a little stuffy beside her in his blue pin-stripe business suit . A little weary and old to tame a filly like Miranda . CHAPTER : The pass road climbed through sloping fields of dust-colored chaparral and raw red cutbacks . By holding the accelerator to the floor I kept our speed at fifty . The road narrowed and twisted more abruptly as we went up . I caught quick glimpses of boulder-strewn slopes , mile-wide canyons lined with mountain oak and spanned by telephone cables . Once through a gap in the hills I saw the sea like a low blue cloud slanting away behind . Then the road looped round into landlocked mountain wilderness , grayed and chilled suddenly by the clouds in the pass.  |p108The  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we entered them they seemed to thin out , blowing across the road in whitish filaments . Barren and dim through the clouds , the mountainside shouldered us . In a 1946 car , with a late-model girl beside me , I could still imagine we were crossing the watershed between Colton 's atomic age and the age of stone when men stood up on their hind legs and began to count time by the sun . The fog grew denser , limiting my vision to twenty-five or thirty feet . I took the last hairpin curves in second . Then the road straightened out . At a definite point the laboring motor accelerated of its own accord , and we came out of the cloud . From the summit of the pass we could see the valley filled with sunlight like a bowl brimming with yellow butter , and the mountains clear and sharp on the other side . " Is n't it glorious ? " Miranda said . " No matter how cloudy it is on the Santa Teresa side , it 's nearly always sunny in the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself just to feel the sun . " " I like the sun . " " Do you really ? I did n't think you 'd go in for simple things like sun . You 're the neon type , are n't you ? " " If you say so . " She was silent for a while , watching the leaping road , the blue sky streaming backward . The road cut straight and flat through the green-and-yellow checkerboard valley . With no one in sight but the Mexican braceros in the fields , I floorboarded . The speedometer needle stuck halfway between eighty-five and ninety . " What are you running away from , Archer ? " she said , in a mocking tone.  | " Not a thing . Do you want a serious answer ? " " It would be nice for a change . " " I like a little danger . Tame danger , controlled by me . It gives me a sense of power , I guess , to take my life in my hands and know damn well I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 've never had one . " " Tell me , " she said , " is that why you do your kind of work ? Because you like danger ? " " It 's as good a reason as any . It would n't be true , though . " " Why , then ? " " I inherited the job from another man . " " Your father ? " " Myself when I was younger . I used to think the world was divided into good people and bad people , that you could pin responsibility for evil on certain definite people and punishthe guilty . I 'm still going through the motions . And talkingtoo much . " " Do n't stop . " " I 'm fouled up . Why should I foul you up ? " " I am already . And I do n't understand what you said . " " I 'll take it from the beginning . When I went into police work in 1935 , I believed that evil was a quality some people were born with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find those people and put them away . But evil is n't so simple . Everybodyhas it in him , and whether it comes out in his actions depends on a number of things . Environment , opportunity , economic pressure , a piece of bad luck , a wrong friend . The trouble is a cop has to go on judging people by rule of thumb , and acting on the judgment . " " Do you judge people ? "  | " Everybody I meet . The graduates of the police schools make a big thing of scientific detection , and that has its place . But most of my work is watching people , and judging them . " " And you find evil in everybody ? " " Just about . Either I 'm getting sharper or people are gettingworse . And that could be . War and inflation always raise a crop of stinkers , and a lot of them have settled in Califor-nia . " " You would n't be talking about our family ? " she said . " Not especially . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not entirely . He 's always been a bit of a stinker , at least since I 've known him . " " All your life ? " " All my life . " " I did n't know you felt that way about him . " " I 've tried to understand him , " she said . " Maybe he had his points when he was young . He started out with nothing , you know . His father was a tenant farmer who never had land of his own . I can understand why Ralph spent his life acquiringland . But you 'd think he 'd be more sympathetic to poor people , because he was poor himself . The strikers on the ranch , for instance . Their living conditions are awful and their ' wages are n't decent , but Ralph wo n't admit it . He 's been doing everything he can to starve them out and break the strike . He ca n't seem to see that Mexican field-workers are people . " " It 's a common enough illusion , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't admit they 're human  --  I 'm developing into quite a moralist in early middle age . " " Are you judging me ? " she asked me , after a pause.  | " Provisionally . The evidence is n't in . I 'd say you have nearly everything , and could develop into nearly anything . " " Why nearly ' ? What 's my big deficiency ? " " A tail on your kite . You ca n't speed up time . You have to pick up its beat and let it support you . " " You 're a strange man , " she said softly . " I did n't know you 'd be able to say things like that . And do you judge your-self ? " " Not when I can help it , but I did last night . I was feeding alcohol to an alcoholic , and I saw my face in the mirror . " " What was the verdict ? " " The judge suspended sentence , but he gave me a tongue-lashing . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it is . " " I do it for a different reason . I still think your reason is a kind of running away . Death wish . " " No jargon , please . Do you drive fast ? " " I 've done a hundred and five on this road in the Caddie . " The rules of the game we were playing were n't clear yet , but I felt outplayed . " And what 's your reason ? " " I do it when I 'm bored . I pretend to myself I 'm going to meet something  --  something utterly new . Something naked tom. , , and bright , a moving target in the road . " My obscure resentment came out as fatherly advice . " You 'll meet something new if you do it often . A smashed head and oblivion . " " Damn you ! " she cried . " You said you liked danger , but you 're as stuffy as Bert Graves . " " I 'm sorry if I frightened you . " " Frightened me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird 's cry . " All you men still have the Victorian hangover . I suppose you think woman 's place is in the home , too ? " " Not my home . " The road began to twist restlessly and rise toward the sky . I let the gradient brake the car . At fifty we had nothing to say to each other . At a height that made me conscious of my breathing we came to a high-backed road of new gravel , barred by a closed wooden gate . A metal mailbox on the gatepostbore the name " Claude " in stencilled white letters . I opened the gate , and Miranda drove the car through . " It 's another mile , " she said . " Do you trust me ? " " No , but I want to look at the scenery . I 've never been here before . " Apart from the road the country looked as if no one had ever been there . A valley dotted with boulders and mountain evergreen opened below us as we spiraled upward . Far down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deer 's movement and disappearance . Another deer went after it in a rocking-horse leap . The air was so clear and still I would n't have been surprised to hear the rustle of their hoofs . But there was no sound above the whine of the motor . Nothing to hear , and nothing to look at but light-saturated air and the bare stone face of the mountain opposite . The car crawled over the rim of a saucer-shaped depression in the top of the mountain . Below us in the center of thep113mesa the Temple in the Clouds stood , hidden from everyone but hawks and airmen . It was a square one-storied structure of white-painted stone and adobe , built around a central court . There were a few outbuildings inside the wire fence that formed a kind of stockade around it . From one of them a thin black smoke was trickling up the sky . Then something moved on the flat roof of the main building , something that had been so still my eyes had taken it for granted . An old man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose with majestic slowness , a huge leather-brown figure . With the uncut tangles of his gray hair and beard standing out from his head , he looked like the rayed sun in an old map . He stooped deliberately to pick up a piece of cloth , which he wound around his naked middle . He raised one arm as if to tell us to be patient , and descended into the inner court . Its ironbound door creaked open . He emerged and waddled to the gate , which he unlocked . I saw his eyes for the first time . They were milky blue , bland and conscienceless like an animal 's . In spite of his great sun-blacked shoulders and the heavy beard that fanned across his chest , he had a womanish air . His rich self-conscious voice was a subtle blend of baritone and contralto . " Greetings , greetings , my friends . Any traveler who comes to my out-of-the-way doorstep is welcome to share my fare . Hospitality stands high among the virtues , close to the supremevirtue of health itself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please leave the automobile outside the fence , my friend . Even the outer circle should not be sullied by the trappings of a mechanical civilization . "  | " I thought you knew him , " I said to Miranda , as we got out of the car . " I do n't think he can see very well . " When we came nearer , his blue-white eyes peered at her face . He leaned toward her , and his straggling gray hair swung forward , brushing his shoulders . " Hello , Claude , " she said crisply . " Why , Miss Sampson ! I was not looking for a visit from youth and beauty today . Such youth ! Such beauty ! " He breathed through his lips , which were very heavy and red . I looked at his feet to check his age . Shod in rope-soled sandals with thongs between the toes , they were gnarled and swollen : sixty-year-old feet . " Thank you , " she said unpleasantly . " I came to see Ralph , if he 's here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am alone here . I have sent my disciples away for the present . " He smiled vaguely withoutuncovering his teeth . " I am an old eagle communing with the mountains and the sun . " " An old vulture ! " Miranda said audibly . " Has Ralph been here recently ? " " Not for several months . He has promised me , but he has not yet come . Your father has spiritual potentialities , but he is still caged and confined by the material life . It is hard to draw him up into the azure world . It is painful for him to open his nature to the sun . " He said it with a chanting rhythm , an almost liturgical beat . " Do you mind if I look around ? " I said . " To make sure he is n't here . " " I tell you I am alone . " He turned to Miranda . " Who is this young man ? "  | " Mr. Archer . He 's helping me look for Ralph . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that he is not here , Mr. Archer . I can not permit you to enter the inner circle , since you have not submitted to the rite of purifica-tion . " " I think I 'll have a look around anyway . " " But that is not possible . " He placed his hand on my shoulder . It was soft and thick and brown , like a fried fish . " You must not enter the temple . It would anger Mithras . " His breath was sour-sweet and foul in my nostrils . I picked his hand off my shoulder . " Have you been purified ? " He raised his innocent eyes to the sun . " You must not jest of these matters . I was a lost and sinful man , blind-hearted and sinful , till I entered the azure world . The sword of the sun slew the black bull of the flesh , and I was purified . " " And I 'm the wild bull of the pampas , " I said to myself . Miranda stepped between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look . I would n't take your word for anything , Claude . " He bowed his shaggy head and smiled a close-mouthed smile of sour benevolence that made my stomach queasy . " As you will , Miss Sampson . The sacrilege will rest upon your heads . I hope and trust that the wrath of Mithras will not be heavy . " She brushed past him disdainfully . I followed her through the arched doorway into the inner court . The red sun over the mountains to the west remained impassive . Without a look or another word Claude mounted the stone staircase inside the door and disappeared onto the roof . The stone-paved court was empty . Its walls were lined with closed wooden doors . I pressed the latch of the nearest . Itp116opened into an oak-raftered room that contained a built-in bed covered with dirty blankets , a scarred iron trunk , unlabeled , a cheap cardboard wardrobe , and the sour-sweet smell of Claude . " The odor of sanctity , " Miranda said , at my shoulder . " Did your father actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " She wrinkled her nose . " He takes this sunworshippingnonsense seriously . It 's all tied up with astrologyin his mind . " " And he actually gave this place to Claude ? " " I do n't know if he deeded it to him . He handed it over for Claude to use as a temple . I suppose he 'll take it back sometime , if he can . And if he ever gets over this religious lunacy of his . " " It 's a queer sort of hunting-lodge , " I said . " It 's not really a hunting-lodge . He built it as a kind of hideout . " " A hideout from what ? " " War . This dates from Ralph 's last phase , the pre-religious one . He was convinced that another war was just around the corner . This was to be his sanctuary if we were invaded . But he got over the fear last year , just before they started work on the bomb shelter . The plans for the shelter were all ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't use the word lunacy , ' " I said . " You did . Were you serious ? " " Not really . " She smiled a little bleakly . " Ralph does n't seem so crazy if you understand him . He felt guilty , I think , because he made money out of the last war . And then there was Bob 's death . Guilt can cause all sorts of irrational fears . "  | " You read another book , " I said . " This time it was a psychologytextbook . " Her reaction was surprising . " You make me sick , Archer . Do n't you get bored with yourself playing the dumb detec-tive ? " " Sure I get bored . I need something naked and bright . A moving target in the road . " " You ! " She bit her lip , flushed , and turned away . We went from room to room , opening and closing the doors . Most of the rooms had beds in them and very little else . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw pallets on the floor . It was narrow-windowed and thickwalledlike a fortress , and the air smelled like the tank of a county jail . " The disciples live well , whoever they are . Did you see any when you were here before ? " " No . But I did n't come inside . " " Some people are suckers for a pitch like Claude 's . They 'll hand over everything they own and get nothing in return but a starvation diet and the prospect of a nervous breakdown . But I 've never heard of a sun-worshippers ' monastery before . I wonder where the suckers are today . " We finished our circuit of the court without seeing anyone . I looked up at the roof . Claude was sitting with his face to the sun , his naked back to us . The flesh hung down in heavy folds from his flanks and hips . His head was moving jerkily back and forth , as if he was arguing with someone , but no sound came from him . Like a bearded woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head outlined by the sun were strange and ridiculous and dreadful . Miranda touched my arm . " Speaking of lunacy  --  "  | " He 's putting on an act , " I said , and half believed it . " At least he was telling the truth about your father . Unless he 's in one of the other buildings . " We crossed the gravel yard to the adobe with the smoking chimney . I looked in through the open door . A girl with a shawl over her head was sitting on her heels in front of a glowing fireplace stirring a bubbling pot . It was a five-gallon pot , and it was full of what looked like beans . " It looks as if the disciples are coming for supper . " Without moving her shoulders the girl turned her head to look at us . The whites of her eyes shone like porcelain in the clay-colored Indian face . " Have you seen an old man ? " I asked her in Spanish . She shrugged one calico shoulder in the general direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is beardless . Beardless , fat , and rich . His name is Senor Sampson . " She shrugged both shoulders and turned back to her steamingpot . Claude 's sandals crunched in the gravel behind us . " I am not wholly alone , as you can see . There is my handmaiden , but she is little better than an animal . If you have done with us , perhaps you will permit me to return to my meditation . Sunset is approaching , and I must pay my respectsto the departing god . " Beside the adobe there was a galvanized iron shed with a padlocked door . " Before you go , open the shed . " Sighing , he took some keys from the folds of his body cloth . The shed contained a pile of bags and cartons , most of which were empty . There were several sacks of beans , a case of condensedmilk , some overalls and work boots in a few of the cartons.  |p119Claude  stood in the doorway watching me . " My disciples sometimes work in the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a form of worship . " He moved back to let me out . I noticed the imprint of a tire in the clay at the edge of the gravel where his foot had been . It was a wide truck tire . I 'd seen the herringbone patternof the tread before . " I thought you did n't let mechanical trappings come inside the fence ? " He peered at the ground and came up smiling . " Only when necessary . A truck delivered some provisions the other day . " " I hope and trust it was purified ? " " The driver has been purified , yes . " " Good . I suppose that you 'll be doing some housecleaning now that we 've contaminated the place . " " It is between you and the god . " With a backward glance at the declining sun he returned to his perch on the roof . On the way back to the state highway I memorized the route so that I could drive it blind at night if I had to . Before we crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the coastal range . The shadowed fields were empty . We passed a dozen truckloadsof field-workers returning to their bunkhouses on the ranches . Crammed like cattle in the rattling vans of the trucks , they stood in patient silence , men , women , and childrenwaiting for food and sleep and the next day 's sunrise.  | I drove carefully , feeling a little depressed , stalled in the twilight period when day has run down and night has n't picked up speed . The clouds flowed in the pass like a torrent of milk and preceded us down the other side of the mountain , blending with the gradual night and the deepening cold . Once or twice on a curve Miranda leaned against me , trembling . I did n't ask her whether she was cold or afraid . I did n't want to force her to make a choice . The clouds had rolled down the mountain all the way to U.S. roi . From far up the pass road I could see the headlights on the highway blurred enormous by the fog . While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway traffic , a pair of bright lights came up fast from the direction of Santa Teresa . They suddenly swung toward us like wild eyes . The speeding car was going to try to turn into the pass road . Its brakes screamed , its rubber skittered and snarled . It was n't going to get past me . " Head down , " I said to Miranda , and tightened my grip on the wheel . The other driver straightened out , roared into second gear at forty-five or fifty , spun in front of my bumper , and passed on my right in the seven-foot space between me and the stop sign . I caught a flashing glimpse of the driver 's face , a thin , pale face jaundiced by my fog lights , under a peaked leather cap . his car was a dark limousine . I backed and turned and started after it . The black-top was slick from the wet , and I was slow in getting under way . The red rear light hightailing up the road was swallowed by the fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on any one of the county roads that paralleled the highway . And perhapsp121the best thing I could do for Sampson was to let the limousine go . I stopped so fast that Miranda had to brace both hands on the dashboard . My reflexes were getting violent . " What on earth 's the matter ? He did n't actually crash us , you know . " " I wish he had . " " He 's reckless , but he drives very well . " " Yeah . He 's a moving target I 'd like to hit some time . " She looked at me curiously . Shadowed from below by the dashlights , her face was dark , with huge bright eyes . " You 're looking grim , Archer . Have I made you angry again ? " " Not you , " I said . " It 's waiting for a break in this case . I prefer direct action . " " I see . " She sounded disappointed . " Please take me home now . I 'm cold and hungry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the highway to Cabrillo Canyon . Beyond the plow of yellow light that the fog lamps pushed ahead of us the trees and hedges hung in the thick air , ash-gray emanations abandoned by the sun . The landscape matched the clouded pattern in my skull . My thoughts were blind and slow , groping for a lead to the place where Ralph Sampson was hidden . The lead was waiting in the mailbox at the entrance to Sampson 's drive , and it took no cunning to find it . Miranda noticed it first . " Stop the car . " When she opened the door , I saw the white envelope stuck in the slot of the mailbox . " Wait . Let me handle it . " My tone held her still with one foot on the ground , one hand reaching for the envelope . I took it by one corner and wrapped it in a clean handkerchief . " There may be finger-prints. "  | " How do you know it 's from Father ? " " I do n't . You drive up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . The fluorescent tube in the ceiling cast a white morgue glow on the white enameled table . There was no name or address on the envelope . I slit one end and drew out the folded sheet it containedwith my fingernails . My heart dropped , when I saw the printed letters pasted to the sheet of paper . The letters had been cut out individuallyand arranged in words , in the classic tradition of kidnapping . These were the words : Mr. Sampson is well in good hands put one hunderd thousan dollars in plain paper parsel ty with string put parsel on grass in middle of road at south end of highway division oposite Fryers Road one mile south of Santa Teresa limits do this at nine oclock tonite after you leave parsel drive away imediately you will be watched drive away north direction Santa Teresa do not attent pollice ambush if you value Sampsons life you will be watched he will come home tomorrow if no ambush no attent to chase no marked billstoo bad for Sampson if you do nt freind of the family " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half whisper . I wanted to say something consoling . All I could think of was  --  too bad for Sampson . " Go and see if Graves is around , " I said . She went immediately . I leaned over the sheet of paper without touching it , and examined the cut-out letters . They varied widely in size andp123type , and were printed on smooth paper , probably cut from the advertising pages of a big-circulation magazine . The spellingpointed at semi-literacy , but you could n't always tell . Some pretty well-educated people were poor spellers . And it might have been faked . I had memorized the letter when Graves came into the kitchen with Taggert and Miranda trailing behind . He came toward me on heavy piston-quick legs , with an iron gleam in his eyes . I pointed to the table . " That was in the mailbox  --  " " Miranda told me . " " It may have been dropped a few minutes ago by a car that passed me on the highway . " Graves leaned over the letter and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway , uncertain whether he was wanted but quite at ease . Though physically they could have been sibs , Miranda was his temperamental opposite . Ugly blue patches had blossomed under her eyes . I-Ier wide lips drooped sullenly over her fine , prominent teeth . She leaned against the doorjamb in a jagged , disconsolate pose . Graves raised his head . " This is it . I 'll get the deputy . " " Here now ? " " Yes . In the study with the money . And I 'll call the sher-iff . " " Has he got a fingerprint man ? " " The D.A . ' s is better . " " Call him too . They 're probably too smart to leave fresh prints , but there may be latent ones . It 's hard to do cut-outs with gloves on . " " Right . Now what was that about a car that passed you ? "  | " Keep it to yourself for now . I 'll handle that end . " " I guess you know what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . I 'm not getting Sampson bumped if I can help it . " " That 's what 's worrying me , " he said , and went through the door so fast that Taggert had to jump back out of his way . I glanced at Miranda . She looked ready to drop . " Make her eat something , Taggert . " " If I can . " He crossed the kitchen to the refrigerator . Her eyes followed him . I hated her for an instant . She was like a dog , a bitch in the rutting season . " I could n't possibly eat , " she said . " Do you think he 's alive ? " " Yes . But I thought you barely liked him . " " This letter makes it so real . It was n't real before . " " It 's too damned real ! Now go away . Go and lie down . " She wandered out of the room . The deputy sheriff came in . IIe was a heavy , dark man in his thirties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , a lopsided look of surprise that did n't quite fit his face . His right hand rested on the gun in his hip holster as if to remind him that he had authority . He said with tentative belligerence : " What goes on out here ? " " Nothing much . Kidnapping and extortion . " " What 's this ? " He reached for the letter on the table . I had to take hold of his wrist to keep him from touching it . His black eyes glared dully into my face . " Who do you think you are ? "  | " The name is Archer . Settle down , officer . You have an evidence case ? " " Yeah , in the car . " " Get it , eh ? ' We 'll hold this for the fingerprint men . " He went out and came back with a black metal box . I dropped the letter into it , and he locked it . It seemed to give him great satisfaction . " Take good care of it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box under his arm . " Do n't let it out of your hands . " Taggert was standing by the open refrigerator with a halfeatenturkey drumstick in his fingers . " What do we do now ? " he asked me , between bites . " You stick around . You may see a little excitement . Got your gun ? " " Sure thing ! " He patted the pocket of his jacket . " How do you think it was done ? You think they grabbed Sampson when he left the airport in Burbank . " " I would n't know . Where 's a phone ? " " There 's one in the butler 's pantry . Right through here . " He opened a door at the end of the kitchen and closed it after me . It was a small room lined with cupboards , with a single window over the copper sink , a wall telephone by the door . I asked long distance for Los Angeles . Peter Colton would be off duty , but he might have left a message . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone himself . " Lew speaking . It 's a snatch . We got the ransom note a few minutes ago . The letter from Sampson was a gimmick to loosen things up . You better talk to the D.A . It probably happened in your territory when Sampson left the Burbank airport day before yesterday . " " They 're taking things slow for kidnappers . " " They can afford to . They 've got the operation blueprinted . Did you get anything on the black limousine ? " " Too much . There were twelve of them rented that day , but most of them look legit . All but two came back to the agencies the same day . The other two were taken for a week , paid in advance . " " Descriptions ? " " Number one  --  a Mrs. Ruth Dickson , blond dame , around forty , living at the Beverly Hills Hotel . ' We checked there , and she 's registered but she was n't in . Number two was a guy on his way to San Francisco . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's only two days , and he has it for a week . Name of Lawrence Becker , a little thin guy not too well dressed  --  " " That may be our man . Did you get the number ? " " Wait a minute , I have it here  --  62 S 895 . It 's a 1940 Lin-coln . " " Agency ? " " The Deluxe in Pasadena . I 'll go out there myself . " " Get the best description you can , and spread the word . " " Natch ! But why the sudden enthusiasm , Lew ? " " I saw a man on the highway here who could fit your description . He passed me in a long black car about the time the ransom note was dropped . And the same Joe or his brother tried to run me down with a blue truck in Pacific Palisades this morning . He wears a peaked leather cap . " " Why did n't you put the arm on him ? " " The same reason you 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we throw our weight around , we 'll never find out . Put out the word for tailing purposes only . " " You telling me my business ? " " Apparently . " " All right . Any more helpful hints ? " " Plant a man in the Wild Piano when it opens . Just in case  --  " " I 've already assigned him . Is that all ? " " Have your office contact the Santa Teresa D.A . I 'm turningthe ransom note over to them for fingerprinting . Good night and thanks . " " Uh-huh . " He hung up , and the operator broke the connection . I kept the receiver to my ear , listening to the dead line . In the middle of the conversation there had been a click and crackle on the wire . It could have been a momentary break in the connection , or it could have been a receiver being lifted on another extension . A full minute passed before I heard the faint metallic rustle of a receiver 's being replaced somewhere in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , a flustered white-haired woman with motherly hips . They both jumped when I opened the door of the pantry . " I was using the phone , " I said . Mrs. Kromberg managed a crumpled smile . " I did n't hear you in there . "  | " How many phones are there in the house ? " " Four or five . Five . Two upstairs , three down . " I gave up the idea of checking the phones . Too manypeople had access to them . " Where is everybody ? " " Mr. Graves called the staff together in the front room . Hewanted to know if anybody saw the car that left the note . " " Did anybody ? " " No . I heard a car a while back , but I did n't think anything about it . They 're always coming down here and turning around in the drive . They do n't know it 's dead end . " She moved closer to me and whispered confidentially : " What was in the note , Mr. Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I went out . Three other servants passed me in the hallway , two young Mexicans in gardener 's clothes , walking in single file with their heads down , and Felix bringing up the rear . I raised a hand to him , but he did n't respond . His eyes were opaque and glittering like lumps of coal . Graves was squatting in front of the fireplace in the livingroomturning a charred log with a pair of tongs . " What 's the matter with the servants ? " I asked him . He stood up with a grunt and glanced at the door . " They seem to know they 're under suspicion . " " I wish they did n't . " " I did n't say anything to give them the idea . They got it by osmosis . I simply asked them if they 'd seen the car . What I really wanted , of course , was a look at their faces before they could close them up . " " You think it 's an inside job , Bert ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together that letter is too well posted . How did he know , for example ,  |p129that  the money would be ready for a nine-o'clock deadline ? " He glanced at his watch . " Seventy minutes from now . " " Sheer blind faith , maybe . " " Maybe . " " We wo n't argue . You 're probably right that it 's partly an inside job . Did anyone see the car ? " " Mrs. Kromberg heard it . The others played dumb , or are . " " And nobody gave himself away ? " " No . These Mexicans and Filipinos are hard to read . " He was careful to add : " Not that I 've any reason to suspect the gardeners , or Felix either . " " What about Sampson himself ? " He looked at me ironically . " Do n't try to be brilliant , Lew . You never were too strong on intuition . " " It 's merely a suggestion . If Sampson pays an eighty-percentincome tax , he could make himself a quick eighty grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done  --  " " It has been . " " But in Sampson 's case it 's fantastic . " " Do n't tell me he 's honest . " He picked up the tongs and struck the burning log . The sparks flew up like a swarm of bright wasps . " Not by everybody'sstandards . But he has n't got the kind of brain for that sort of a setup . It 's too risky . Besides , he does n't need the money . His oil properties are valued around five million , but they 're worth more like twenty-five in terms of income . A hundred thousand dollars is small change to Sampson . This kidnapping is the real thing , Lew . You ca n't get around it . " " I 'd like to , " I said . " So many kidnappings end up in a murder of convenience . "  | " This one does n't have to , " he said , in a deep growling voice , " and , by God , it is n't going to ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come through with Sampson we 'll hunt them down . " " I 'm with you . " But it was easier said than done . " Who delivers the lettuce ? " " Why not you ? " " For one thing , they may know me . And I have something else to do . You do it , Bert . And you 'd better take Taggert along . " " I do n't like him . " " He 's a sharp kid , and he 's not afraid of a gun . If anything goes wrong , you may need help . " " Nothing is going to go wrong . But I 'll take him if you say so . " " I say so . " Mrs. Kromberg appeared in the hall doorway , nervously pulling at the front of her smock . " Mr. Graves ? " " Well ? " " I wish you 'd talk to Miranda , Mr. Graves . I tried to take her up something to eat , and she would n't unlock her door . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I 'll talk to her later . Leave her alone for now . " " I do n't like it when she acts this way . She 's so emotional . " " Forget it . Ask Mr. Taggert to meet me in the study , will you ? And ask him to bring his pistols  --  loaded . " " Yes , sir . " She was on the point of tears , but she compressedher heavy lips and went away . When Graves turned from the door , I saw that she had communicated some of her anxiety to him . One of his cheeksp131was twitching slightly . His eyes were looking at something beyond the room . " She 's probably feeling guilty , " he said , half to himself . " Guilty about what ? " " Nothing tangible . I suppose it 's basically because she has n't been able to take her brother 's place . She 's watched the old man going downhill , and she probably feels he would n't have gone down so far and so fast if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't his wife , " I said . " What 's Mrs. Sampson 's reaction ? Have you seen her ? " " A few minutes ago . She 's taking it very nicely . Reading a novel , in fact . How do you like that ? " " I do n't . Maybe she 's the one that should be feeling guilty . " " It would n't help Miranda if she did . Miranda 's a funny girl . She 's very sensitive , but I do n't think she knows it . She 's always sticking her neck out , living beyond her emotionalresources . " " Are you going to marry her , Bert ? " " I will if I can . " He smiled wryly . " I 've asked her more than once . She has n't said no . " " You could take good care of her . She 's ripe for marriage . " He looked at me in silence for a moment . His lips continued to smile , but his eyes flashed a hands-off signal . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . " " I gave her some fatherly advice , " I said . " About driving too fast . " " As long as you keep it on the paternal level . " Abruptly he changed the subject . " What about this character Claude ? Could he be in on the kidnapping ? "   " He could be in on anything . I would n't trust him with a burnt-out match . But I did n't get anything definite . He claimed he had n't seen Sampson for months . " Straw-yellow fog lamps brushed the side of the house , and a moment later a car door slammed . " That must be the sheriff , " Graves said . " It took him a hell of a long time . " The sheriff came in with a great show of haste , like a sprinter breasting the tape . he was a big man in a business suit , carrying a wide-brimmed rancher 's hat . Like his clothes , his face was hybrid , half cop and half politician . The sternnessof his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosely folded mouth that liked women and drink and words . He thrust out his hand to Graves . " I would have been here sooner , but you asked me to pick up Humphreys . " The other man , who had followed him quietly into the room , was wearing a tuxedo . " I was at a party , " he said . " How are you , Bert ? " Graves introduced me . The sheriff 's name was Spanner . Humphreys was the District Attorney . He was tall and balding , with the lean face and haunted eyes of an intellectual sharpshooter . He and Graves did n't shake hands . They were too close for that . Humphreys had been Deputy Prosecutor when Graves was District Attorney . I stood back and let Graves do the talking . He told them what they needed to know and left out what they did n't need to know . When he had finished , the sheriff said : " The letter orders you to drive away in a northern direction . That means he 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles . " " That 's what it means , " Graves said.  | " Now if we set up a road block down the highway a piece , we should be able to catch him . " " We ca n't do that , " I said in words of one syllable . " If we do , we can kiss good-bye to Sampson . " " But if we catch the kidnapper , we can make him talk  --  " " Hold it , Joe , " Humphreys put in . " We 've got to assume that there are more than one . If we knock off one of them , the other or others will knock off Sampson . It 's as clear as the nose on your face . " " And it 's in the letter , " I said . " Have you seen the letter ? " " Andrews has it , " Humphreys said . " He 's my fingerprint man . " " If he finds anything , you should check with the F.B.I . files . " I sensed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to be tactful and I did n't trust small-time cops to know their business . I turned to the sheriff : " Are you in touch with the L. A. County authorities ? " " Not yet . I felt I should assess the situation first . " " All right , this is the situation . Even if we obey instructions to the letter , there 's a better than fifty-fifty chance that Sampson wo n't come out alive . He must be able to identify at least one of the gang  --  the one that picked him up in Burbank . That 's bad for him . You 'll make it worse if you try to trip the money pickup . You 'll have a kidnapper in the county jail , and Sampson lying somewhere with his throat cut . The best thing you can do is get on the wires . Let Graves handle the business at this end . " Spanner 's face was mottled with anger , his mouth half open to speak . Humphreys cut him off . " That makes sense , Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to compromise . The thing is to save Sampson 's life . What say we get back to town now ? " He stood up . The sheriff followed him out . " Can we trust Spanner not to make his own arrange-ments ? " " I think so , " Graves said slowly . " Humphreys will keep an eye on him . " " Humphreys sounds like a good head . " " The best . I worked with him for seven-odd years , and I never caught him in a bad mistake . I got him the appointmentwhen I resigned . " There was some regret in his voice . " You should have stuck with the work , " I said . " You got a lot of satisfaction out of it . " " And damned little money ! I stuck with it for ten years , and I ended up in debt . " He gave me a sly look . " Why did you quit the Long Beach force , Lew ? " " The money was n't the main thing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dirty politics . Anyway , I did n't quit , I was fired . " " All right , you win . " He glanced at his watch again . It was nearly eight thirty . " Time to get on our horse . " Alan Taggert was in the study , in a tan trench coat that bunched at the waist and made his shoulders look huge . He brought his hands out of his pockets with a gun in each fist . Graves took one , and Taggert kept the other . They were .32 target pistols with slender blue-steel snouts and prominent sights . " Remember , " I said , for Taggert 's benefit , " no shooting unless you 're shot at . " " Are n't you coming along ? "  | " No . " I said to Graves : " You know the corner at Fryers Road ? " " Yes . " " There 's no cover around ? " " Not a thing . The open beach on one side , and the cutbankon the other . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll tag along behind and park a mile or so down the highway . " " You 're not going to try a fast one ? " " Not me . I just want to see him go by . I 'll meet you at the filling station at the city limits afterward . The Last Chance . " " Right . " Graves twirled the knobs of the wall safe . From the city limits to Fryers Road the highway was fourlane , a mile-long shelf cut into the bluffs that stood along the shore . It was divided in the middle by a strip of turf between concrete curbs . At the intersection with Fryers Road the turf ended and the highway narrowed to three lanes . Graves 's Studebaker made a quick U turn at the intersection and parked with its lights burning on the shoulder of the highway . It was a good place for the purpose , a bare corner rimmed on the right by a line of white posts . The entrance to Fryers Road was a gray-black hole in the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a tree . The cars on the highway were few and far between . It was ten minutes to nine by my dashboard clock . I waved to Taggert and Graves and drove on past them . It was seven tenths of a mile to the next side road . I checked it on my mileage . Two hundred yards beyond this side road a parking space for sightseers had been built up over the beach on the right side of the highway . I turned off and parked with the lights out and the nose of the car pointed south . It was seven minutes to nine . If everything went on schedule , the pay-off car should pass me in ten minutes . The fog closed around the car when it stopped , rising from the shore like an impossible gray tide . A few pairs of headlightswent north through the fog like the eyes of deep-sea fish . Below the guardrail the sea breathed and gargled in the darkness . At two minutes after nine the rushing headlights came around the curve from the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached me and turned up the side road to the left . I could n't see its color or shape but I heard it losing rubber . The driver 's technique seemed familiar . Leaving my lights out , I drove across the highway and along its shoulder to the side road . Before I reached it I heard three sounds , remote and muffled by the fog . The banshee wail of brakes , the sound of a shot , the ascending roar of a motor picking up speed . The trough of the side road was filled with diffused white light . I stopped my car a few feet short of the intersection . Another car came out of the side road and turned left in front of me toward Los Angeles . It was a long-nosed convertiblepainted light cream . I could n't see the driver through the blurred side window , but I thought I saw a dark mass of woman 's hair . I was n't in position to give chase , and I could n't have anyway . I switched on my fog lamps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway a car was standing with two of its wheels in the ditch . I parked behind it and got out with the gun in my hand . It was a black limousine , a prewar Lin- coin custom job . The engine was idling and the lights were on . The license number was 6 2 S 895 . I opened the front door with my left hand , my gun cocked in my right . A little man leaned toward me , peering into the fog with intent dead eyes . I caught him before he fell out . I 'd been feeling death in my bones for twenty-four hours . CHAPTER 19 : He was still wearing his leather capsharply tilted on the left side of his head . There was a round hole in the cap above his left ear . The left side of his face was peppered with black powder burns . His head had been knocked askew by the force of the bullet , and rolled on his shoulder when I pushed him upright . His black-nailed hands slipped off the steering wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat with one hand , I went through his pockets with the other . The side pockets of his leather windbreaker contained a windproof lighter smelling of gasoline , a cheap wooden case half full of cigarettes rolled in brown wheat-straw paper , and a four-inch spring-knife . There was a worn sharkskin wallet in the hip pocket of his levis , containing eighteen or twenty dollars in small bills and a California driver 's license recently issued to one Lawrence Becker . The address on the license was a cheap Los Angeles hotel teetering on the edge of Skid Row . It would n't be his address , and Lawrence Becker would n't be his name . The left side pocket of the levis held a dirty comb in a leatherette case . The other pocket held a heavy bunch of car keys on a chain  --  keys for every make of car from Chevrolet to Cadillac  --  and a half-used book of matches labeled : " Souvenirof The Corner , Cocktails and Steaks , Highway ioi South of Buenavista . " He had nothing on under his windbreakerbut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dashboard ash tray , but the rest of the car was as clean as a whistle . Not even a registration card in the glove compartment , nor a hundredthousand dollars in moderate-sized bills . I put the things back in his pockets and propped him up in the seat , slamming the door to hold him . I looked back once before I got into my car . The lights of the Lincoln were still burning , the idling motor still sending out a steady trickle of vapor from the exhaust . The dead man hunched at the wheel looked ready to start on a long , fast trip to another part of the country . Graves 's Studebaker was parked by the pumps at the filling station . Graves and Taggert were standing beside it and came running when I drove up . Their faces were pale and slick with excitement . " It was a black limousine , " Graves said . " We drove away slow and saw him stop at the corner . I could n't see his face , but he was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is . " " Did you see him pass you ? " Taggert 's voice was so tense he whispered . " He turned off before he got to me . He 's sitting in his car on the next side road with a bullet in his head . " " Good Christ ! " Graves cried . " You did n't shoot him , Lew ? " " Somebody else did . A cream convertible came out of the side road a minute after the shot . I think a woman was driv- ing . She headed for L. A. Now , are you sure he got the money ? " " I saw him pick it up . " " He has n't got it any more ; so one of two things happened . It was a heist , or his partners double-crossed him . If he was highjacked , his partners do n't get the hundred grand . If they double-crossed him , they 'll double-cross us . Either way it 's bad for Sampson . " " What do we do now ? " Taggert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wraps off the case . Give the police the go-ahead . Post a reward . I 'll see Mrs. Sampson about it . " " One thing , Bert , " I said . " We 've got to keep this shooting quiet  --  out of the papers anyway . If highjackers did it , his partners will blame us , and that 's the end of Sampson . " " The dirty bastards ! " Graves 's voice was heavy and grim . " We kept our side of the bargain . If I could get my hands on them  --  " " You would n't know it . All we have is a dead man in a rented car . You better start with the sheriff ; he wo n't do much , but it 's a nice gesture . Then the highway patrol and the F.B.I . Get as many men on it as you can . " I released my emergency brake and let the car roll a few inches . Graves backed away from the window . " Where do you think you 're going ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for Sampson I might as well . " It took me down the highway fifty miles to Buenavista . The highway doubled as the town 's main street . It was lit by motel and tavern signs and three theater fronts . Two of the three theaters advertised Mexican films . The Mexicans lived off the land when the canneries were closed . The rest of the townspeople lived off the Mexicans and the fishing fleet . I stopped in the middle of the town , in front of an overgrowncigar store that sold guns , magazines , fishing tackle , draft beer , stationery , baseball gloves , contraceptives , and cigars . Two dozen Mexican boys with grease-slicked duck-tail haircuts were swarming in and out of the store , drawn two ways by the pinball machines in the back and the girls on the street . The girls went by in ribbons and paints , cutting the air with their bosoms . The boys whistled and postured or pretended to be uninterested . I called one to the curb and asked him where the Corner was . He conferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Straight ahead , about five miles , where the road goes down to White Beach . " " There 's a big red sign , " the other boy said , stretching out his arms enthusiastically . " You ca n't miss it . The Corner . " I thanked them . They bowed and smiled and nodded as if I had done them a favor . The sign spelled out " The Corner " in red-neon script on the roof of a long , low building to the right of the highway . A black-and-white sign at the intersection beyond it pointed to White Beach . I parked in the asphalt parking-space beside the building . There were eight or ten other cars in the lot , and a trailer truck on the shoulder of the highway . Through the half-curtained windows I could see a few couples at tables , a few others dancing . To the left as I went in was a long bar , totally empty . The dining-room and dance floor was to the right . I stood at the entrance as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the big room to life . Their music came from a jukebox . There was an empty orchestra stand at the back of the room . All that was left of the big war nights were the foot-grained floor , rows of unset rickety tables , odors like drunken memories in the walls , tattered decorations like drunken hopes . The customers felt the depression in the room . Their faces groped for laughter and enjoyment and could n't quite get hold of them . None of the faces meant anything to inc . The solitary waitress came up to me . She had dark eyes and a soft mouth , a good body going to seed at twenty . You could read her history in her face and body . She walked carefully as if she had sore feet . " You want a table , sir ? " " Thanks , I 'll sit in the bar . You may be able to help me , though . I 'm looking for a man I met at a baseball game . I do n't see him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble  --  I do n't know his name . I owe him money on a bet , and he said he 'd meet me here . Ilc 's a little fellow , about thirty-five , wears a leather windbreaker and a leather cap . Blue eyes , sharp nose . " And a hole in his head , sister , a hole in his head . " I think I know who you mean . His name 's Eddie something , or something . He comes in for a drink sometimes , but he has n't been in tonight . " " He said he 'd meet me here . What time does he usually come in ? " " Later than this  --  around midnight . IIe drives a truck , do n't he ? " " Yeah , a blue truck . "   " That 's the one , " she said . " I seen it in the parking lot . He was in a couple of nights ago , used our phone for a longdistancetelephone call . Three nights ago , it was . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to collect when it runs over three minutes  --  but Eddie said he 'd reverse the charges , so the boss let him go ahead . How much do you owe him , anyway ? " " Plenty . You do n't know where he was calling ? " " No . It 's none of my business , anyway . Is it any of yours ? " " It 's just that I want to get in touch with him . Then I could send him his money . " " You can leave it with the boss if you want to . " " Where 's he ? " " Chico , behind the bar . " A man at one of the tables rapped with his glass , and she walked carefully away . I went into the bar . The bartender 's face , from receding hairline to slack jaw , was terribly long and thin . His night of presiding at an empty bar made it seem even longer . " What 'll it be ? " " A beer . " His jaw dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern . " " That 's thirty-five , with the music . " His jaw recovered the lost ground . " We provide the music . " " Can I get a sandwich ? " " Sure thing , " he said , almost cheerfully . " What kind ? " " Bacon and egg . " " O.K. " He signaled the waitress through the open door . " I 'm looking for a guy called Eddie , " I said . " The one that phoned me long-distance the other night . "   " You from Las Vegas ? " " Just came from there . " " How 's business in L. V. ? " " Pretty slow . " " That 's too bad , " he said happily . " What were you looking for him for ? " " I owe him some money . Does he live around here ? " " Yeah , I think he does . I do n't know where , though . He come in once or twice with a blond dame . Probably his wife . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " " Thanks , I will . " I took my beer to a table beside the window , from which I could watch the parking lot and the main entrance . After a while the waitress brought my sandwich . She lingered even after I paid and tipped her . " Going to leave the money with the boss ? " " I 'm thinking about it . I want to be sure he gets it . " " You must be eaten up with honesty , eh ? " " You know what happens to bookies that do n't pay off . " " I sort of thought you was a bookie . " Shc leaned toward me with sudden urgency . " Listen , mister , I got a girl friend , she goes out with an exercise boy , she says he says Jinx is a cert in the third tomorrow . Would you bet it on the nose or across the board ? " " Save your money , " I said . " You ca n't beat them . " " I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's boy friend , he says Jinx is a cert . " " Save it . " Her mouth pursed skeptically . " You 're a funny kind of bookie . "   " All right . " I handed her two ones . " Play Jinx to show . " She looked at me with a scowl of surprise . " Gee , thanks , mister  --  only I was n't asking for money . " " It 's better than losing your own money , " I said . I had n't eaten for nearly twelve hours , and the sandwich tasted good . While I was eating it several cars arrived . A party of young people came in laughing and talking , and business picked up at the bar . Then a black sedan rolled into the parkinglot , a black Ford sedan with a red police searchlight sticking out like a sore thumb beside the windshield . The man who got out wore plain clothes as obvious as a baseball umpire 's suit , with gun wrinkles over the right hip . I saw his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . It was the deputy sheriff from Santa Teresa . I got up quickly and went through the door at the end of the bar into the men 's lavatory , locking the door behind me . I loweredthe top of the toilet seat and sat down to brood over my lack of foresight . I should n't have left the book matches in Eddie something 's pocket . I put in eight or ten minutes reading the inscriptions on the whitewashed walls . " John Rags ' Latino , Winner 12o Hurdles , Dearborn High School , Dearborn , Mich. , 1946 . " " Franklin P. Schneider , Osage County , Oklahoma , Deaf Mute , Thank you . " The rest of them were the usual washroomgraffiti interspersed with primitive line drawings . The naked bulb in the ceiling shone in my eyes . My brain skipped a beat , and I went to sleep sitting up . The room was a whitewashed corridor slanting down into the bowels of the earth . I followed it down to the underground river of filth that ran under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wade the excremental river . Fortunately I had my stilts with me . They carried me untainted , wrapped in cellophane , to the landing on the other side . I tossed my stilts away  --  they were also crutches  --  and mounted a chrome-plated escalator that gleamed like the jaws of death . Smoothly and surely it lifted me through all the zones of evil to a rose-embowered gate , which a maid in gingham opened for me , singing Home , Sweet Home . I stepped out into a stone-paved square , and the gate clanged shut behind me . It was the central square of the city , but I was alone in it . It was very late . Not a streetcar was in sight . A single yellow light shone down on the foot-smoothed pavement . When I moved , my footsteps echoed lonesomely , and on all four sides the hunchbacked tenements muttered like a forest before a storm . The gate clanged shut again , and I opened my eyes . Something metallic was pounding on the door . " Open up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in there . " I slipped the bolt and pulled the door wide open . " You in a hurry , officer ? " " So it 's you . I thought maybe it was you . " His black eyes and heavy lips were bulging with satisfaction . He had a gun in his hand . " I knew damn well it was you , " I said . " I did n't think it was necessary to tell everybody in the place . " " Maybe you had a reason for keeping quiet , eh ? Maybe you had a reason for hiding in here when I come in ? The sheriff thinks it 's an inside job , and he 'll want to know what you 're doing here . " " This is the guy , " the bartender said , at his shoulder . " He said Eddie phoned him in Las Vegas . "   " What you got to say to that ? " the deputy demanded . He waggled the gun in my face . " Come in and close the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head . " " I do n't think so . " " Put your hands on your head . " The gun poked into my solar plexus . " You carrying a gun ? " He started to frisk me with his other hand . I stepped back out of his reach . " I 'm carrying a gun . You ca n't have it . " He moved toward me again . The door swung closed behind him . " You know what you 're doing , eh ? Resisting an **27;4485;TOOLONG . I got a good mind to put you under arrest . " " You got a good mind , period . " " No cracks from you , jerk . All I want to know is what you 're doing here . " " Enjoying myself . " " So you wo n't talk , eh ? " he said , like a comic-book cop . He raised his free hand to slap me . " Hold it , " I said . " Do n't lay a finger on me . " " And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop . It would be a blot on my record . " Our glances met and deadlocked . His raised hand hung stiff in the air and gradually subsided . " Now put your gun away , " I said . " I do n't like being threatened . " " Nobody asked you what you liked , " he said , but his fire had gone out . His swarthy face was caught between conflictingemotions : anger and doubt , suspicion and bewilderment .   " I came here for the same reason you did  --  officer . " The word came hard , but I managed to get it out . " I found the book matches in Eddie 's pocket  --  " " How come you know his name ? " he said alertly . " The waitress told me . " " Yeah ? The bartender said he phoned you in Las Vegas . " " I was trying to pump the bartender . Get it ? It was a gag . I was trying to be subtle . " " Well , what did you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie , and he drove a truck . He came in here for drinks sometimes . Three nights ago he phoned Las Vegas from here . Sampson was in Las Vegas three nights ago . " " No kidding ? " " I would n't kid you , officer , even if I could . " " Jesus , " he said , " it all fits in , do n't it ? " " I never thought of that , " I said . " Thank you very much for pointing it out to me . " He gave me a queer look , but he put away his gun . CHAPTER 20 : I drove a half a mile down thehighway , turned , drove back again , and parked at the intersectiondiagonally across from the Corner . The deputy 's car was still in the parking lot . The fog was lifting , dissolving into the sky like milk in water , and blowing out to sea . The expanding horizon only reminded me that Ralph Sampson could be a long way from there  --  anywhere at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the sea , or wearing a hole in the head like Eddie . The cars went by the roadhouse in both directions , headed for home or headed for brighter lights . In the rear-vision mirror my face was ghostly pale , as if I had caught a little death from Eddie . There were circles under my eyes , and I needed a shave . A truck came up from the south and passed me slowly . It wheeled into the parking lot of the Corner . The truck was blue and had a closed van . A man jumped down from the cab and shuffled across the asphalt . I knew his rubber-kneed walk , and in the light from the entrance I knew his face . A savage sculptor had hacked it out of stone and smashed it with another stone . He stopped with a jerk when he saw the black police car . Stopped and turned and ran back to the blue truck . It backed out with a grinding of gears , and turned down the road towardsWhite Beach . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I followed it . The road changed from black-top to gravel , and finally to sand . For two miles I ate his dust . Where the road came down to the beach between two bluffs , another road crossed it . The lights of the truck turned left and climbed the slope . When they were over the rise and out of sight , I followed them . The road was a single track cut into the side of the hill . From the crest I could see the ocean below to my right . There was a traveling moon in the clouds , which were drifting out to sea . Its light on the black water made a dull lead-foil shine . The hill flattened out ahead , and the road straightened . I drove on slowly with my lights out . Before I knew it I was abreast of the truck . It was standing in a lane with no lights showing , fifty yards off the road . I kept going .   The road ended abruptly at the bottom of the hill a quarter mile further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , but its entrance was blocked by a wooden gate . I turned my car in the dead end and climbed the hill on foot . A row of eucalyptus trees , ragged against the sky , edged the lane where the truck was standing . I left the road and kept them between me and the truck . The ground was uneven , dotted with clumps of coarse grass . I stumbled more than once . Then space fell open in front of me , and I nearly walked off the edge of the bluff . Far down below , the white surf stroked the beach . The sea looked close enough for a dive , but hard as metal . Below me to the right there was a white square of light . I climbed and slid down the side of the hill , holding onto the grass to keep from falling . A small building took shape around the light , a white cottage held in a groin of the bluff . The unblinded window gave me a full view of the single room . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window on my hands and knees . There were two people in the room . Neither of them was Sampson . Puddler was wedged in a chair cut out of a barrel , his broken profile toward me , a bottle of beer in his fist . He was facing a woman on an unmade studio bed against the wall . The gasoline lamp that hung from a rafter in the unplastered ceiling threw a hard white light on her streaked blond hair and her face . It was a thin and harried face , with wide resentfulnostrils and a parched mouth . Only the cold brown eyes were lively in it , darting and peering from the puckered skin of their sockets . I moved my head sideways , out of their range .   The room was n't large , but it seemed to be terribly bare . The pine floor was carpetless , slick with grime . A wooden table piled with dirty dishes stood under the light . Beyond it against the far wall were a two-burner oil stove , a sagging icebox , a rust-mottled sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was so still , the clapboard walls so thin , that I could hear the steady suspiration of the lamp . And Puddler 's voice when he said : " I ca n't wait here all night , can I ? You ca n't expect me to wait here all night . I got a job to get back to . And I do n't like that pollice car setting up there at the Corner . " " That 's what you said before . That car do n't mean any-thing . " " I 'm saying it again . I should of been back at the Piano already ; you know that . Mr. Troy was mad when Eddie did n't show . " " Let him get apoplexy . " The woman 's voice was sharp and thin like her face . " If he do n't like the way Eddie does the job , he can stick it . " " You ai n't in no position to talk like that . " Puddler looked from side to side of the room . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a job when he got out of the pen . When he got out of the pen and come sucking around for a job and Mr. Troy give him one  --  " " For God 's sake ! Ca n't you stop repeating yourself , dim brain ? " His scarred face gathered in folds of hurt surprise . He drew in his head , and his thick neck wrinkled up like a turtle 's neck . " That 's no way to talk , Marcie . " " You shut your yap about Eddie and the pen . " Her voice bit like a thin knife blade . " How many jails you seen the insideof , dim brain ? " His answer was a tormented bellow . " Lay off me , hear . " " All right then , lay off Eddie . " " Where the hell is Eddie , anyway ? " " I do n't know where he is or why , but I know he 's got a reason . " " It better be good when he talks to Mr. Troy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got you hypnotized , has n't he ? Maybe Eddie wo n't be talking to Mr. Troy . " His small eyes peered at her , trying to read her meaning in her face , and gave up . " Listen , Marcie , " he said after a pause . " You can drive the truck . " " The hell you say ! I want no part of that racket . " " It 's good enough for me . It 's good enough for Eddie . You 're getting awful fancy-pants since he took you off the street  --  " " Shut up or you 'll be sorry ! " she said . " The trouble with you is you 're yellow . You see a patrol car and you wet your pants . So you try to get a woman to take your rap , like any other pimp . " He stood up suddenly , brandishing the bottle . " Lay off me , hear . I do n't take nothing from nobody . You was a man , I spoil your face for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over her knees . She answered very coolly . " You would n't say that in front of Eddie . He 'd saw you to pieces , and you know it . " " That little monkey ! " " Yeah , that little monkey ! Sit down , Puddler . Everybody knows you 're a powerful battler . I 'll get you another beer . " She got up and moved across the room , stepping lightly and furiously like a starved cat . Taking a towel from a nail beside the sink , she dabbed at her beer-stained bathrobe . " You drive the truck ? " Puddler said hopefully . " Do I have to say everything twice , the same as you ? I 'm not driving the truck . If you 're afraid , let one of them drive . " " Naw , I ca n't do that . They do n't know the road ; they get knocked off . " " You 're wasting time , then , are n't you ? " " Yeah , I guess so . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor and wall . " How 's about a little something before I go ? A little party . Eddie 's probably in the sack with somebody . I got plenty what it takes . " She picked up a bread knife from the table , the kind with a wavy cutting edge . " Take it away with you , Puddler , or I 'll love you up with this . " " Come on now , Marcie . We could get along . " He stood still , keeping his distance . She gulped to control her rising hysteria , but her voice came out as a scream . " Beat it ! " The bread knife moved in the glaring light , pointed at his throat . " O.K. , Marcie . You do n't have to get mad . " He shrugged his shoulders and turned away with the hurt and helpless look of any rejected lover . I left the window and started up the hill . Before I reached the top , a door swung open , projecting an oblong of light on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see the shadow of my head on the dry grass in front of my face . Then the door closed , drawing darkness over me . Puddler 's shadow came out of the pool of shadows behind the house . He went up the steep lane , scuffing the dust with his feet , and disappeared behind the eucalyptus trees .   I had to choose between him and the blond woman , Marcie . I chose Puddler . Marcie could wait . She 'd wait foreverbefore Eddie something came back . CHAPTER 21 : A few miles north of Buenavistathe blue truck left the highway , turning off to the right . I stopped to let it get well ahead . A sign at the intersection said " Lookout Road . " Before I turned up after it , I switched to my fog lamps . The fog had blown out to sea , but I did n't want Puddler to see the same headlights behind him all the way . All the way was close to seventy miles , two hours of rough driving through mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears hurt , was as bad as any road I 'd driven by daylight : two ruts along a black cliff edge , with dark eternity waiting below each curve . The truck highballed along as if it was safe on rails . I let it get out of sight , switched my lights again , and tried to feel like a new man driving a differentcar . We came by a different route into the valley Miranda and I had crossed in the afternoon . On the straight valley road I turned out my car lights entirely and drove by the light of the moon , eked out by memory . I thought I knew where the truck was going . I had to be certain . On the other side of the valley it climbed into the mountains , up the twisting black-top which led to the Temple in the Clouds . I had to use my lights again to follow it . WhenP154I reached Claude 's mailbox the wooden gate beside it had been closed . The truck was far above me , a glowworm crawlingup the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cleared sky was salted with stars . The unclouded moon was motionless among them , a round white hole in the night . I was tired of waiting , of following people down dark roads and never seeing their faces . So far as I knew , there were only the two of them there , Puddler and Claude . I had a gun  --  and the advantage of surprise . I opened the gate and drove through , up the winding lane to the rim of the mesa , and down toward the Temple . Above its white mass there was a faint glow from an interior light . The truck was standing inside the open wire gate , its back doors swinging wide . I parked at the gate and got out . There was nothing inside the truck but crouched shadows , a wooden bench padded with burlap along each side , the pungent odor of men who have sweated and dried in their clothes . The ironbound door of the temple creaked open then . Claude came out , a moonlit caricature of a Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is that ? " he said . " Archer . Remember me ? " I moved from behind the truck and let him see me . He had an electric lantern in his hand . It shone on the gun in mine . " What are you doing here ? " His beard waggled , but his voice was steady . " Still looking for Sampson , " I said . As I approached he backed toward the door . " You know he is not here . Was one sacrilege not enough for you ? "   " Skip the mumbo jumbo , Claude . Did it ever fool anybody at all ? " " Come in if you must , then , " he said . " And I see you must . " He held the door for me and closed it after me . Puddler was standing in the center of the court . " Get over there with Puddler , " I said to Claude . But Puddler came towards me in a shuffling run . I shot once at his feet . The bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and whined into the adobe wall on the other side of the court . Puddler stood still and looked at me . Claude made a half-hearted try to knock down my gun . I took him in the stomach with my elbow . He doubled up on the pavement . " Come here , " I said to Puddler . " I want to talk to you . " He stayed where he was . Claude sat up hugging his torso and cried out loudly in a Spanish dialect I did n't understand . A door sprang open as if it knew Spanish , on the other side of the court . A dozen men came out . They were small and brown , moving quickly toward me . Their teeth flashed in the moonlight . They came on silently , and I was afraid of them . Because of that , or something else , I held my fire . The brown men looked at the gun and came on anyway . I clubbed the gun and waited . The first two got bloody scalps . Then they swarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs from under me , kicked consciousness out of my head . It slid like a disappearing tail light down the dark mountainsideof the world . I came to fighting . My arms were pinned , my raw mouth kissing cement . I realized after a while that I was fighting myself . My arms were tied behind me , my legs bent up and tied to my wrists . All I could do was rock a little and beat the side of my head against cement . I decided against this policy . I tried yelling . My skull vibrated like live skin on a drumhead . I could n't hear my voice above the roar . I gave up yelling . The roar went on in my head , rising higher and higher until it was out of my range , a silent screech . Then the real pain began , pounding my temples in syncopated rhythm like roustabouts driving stakes . I was grateful for any interruption , even Claude . " The wrath of the god is heavy , " he said , above and behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Stop gabbling , " I said , to the cement . " You 'll be up against two kidnapping raps instead of one . " " Bum raps , Mr. Archer . " He made a clucking sound , tongue against palate . By straining my neck I could see his gnarled , sandaled feet on the floor near my head . " You misunderstand the situation , " he said , putting on his vocabulary like a garment . " You invaded our retreat by armed force , assaulted me , attacked my friends and disciples  --  " I tried to laugh mirthlessly , and succeeded . " Is Puddler one of your disciples ? He 's a very spiritual type . " " Listen to me , Mr. Archer . We might with perfect justificationhave killed you in self-defense . Your life is still in our gift . " " Why do n't you climb up the chimney and ride away ? " " You fail to understand the seriousness of this  --  " " I understand that you 're a smelly old crook . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't functioningproperly . He stamped with his heel in my side , just above the kid- neys . My mouth opened , and my teeth ground on the cement . No sound came out . " Think about it , " he said . The light receded and a door slammed . The pain in my head and body pulsated like a star . Small and remote , then large and near , then dwindling down to a whirring point , the tip of a restless drill . On the threshold of consciousness my mind swarmed with images from beyond the threshold : uglier faces than I 'd seen in any street , eviller streets than I 'd seen in any city . I came to the empty square in the city 's heart . Death lurked behind the muttering windows , an old whore with sickness under her paint . A face looked down at me , changing by the second : Miranda 's brown young face sprouting gray hair , Claude 's mouth denuded to become Fay 's smile , Fay shrinking down , all but the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was withered by rapid age to the silver head of Troy . Eddie 's bright dead gaze came back again and again , and the Mexican faces repeated themselves , each one like the other , with flat black eyes and shining teeth curved downward in a smile of anger and fear . With my arms roped tight behind me , my heels pressed into my buttocks , I slid over the threshold into a bad sleep . Light against my eyelids brought me back to a closed red world . I heard a voice above me and kept my eyes closed . The voice was Troy 's soft purr . " You 've made a serious error , Claude . I know this chap , you see . Now why should n't you have told me about his earlier visit ? " " I did n't think it was important . He was looking for Sampson , that was all . Sampson 's daughter was with him . " Claude was speaking naturally for the first time . His voice had lost its orotundity and risen a full octave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think it was important , eh ? I 'll tell you just how important it is for you . It means that your usefulness is ended . You can take your brown-skinned doxy and get out . " " This is my place ! Sampson said I could live here . You ca n't order me out . " " I 've already done so , Claude . You 've bungled your piece of the line , and that means you 're finished . Probably the whole thing is finished . We 're clearing out of the Temple , and we 're not leaving you behind to turn stool pigeon . " " But where can I go ? ' What can I do ? " " Open another store-front church . Go back to Gower Gulch . What you do is no concern of mine . " " Fay wo n't like this , " Claude said hesitantly . " I do n't propose to consult her . And we 'll have no more argument , or I 'll turn you over to Puddler to argue it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I have one more job for you . " " What is it ? " Claude 's voice tried to sound eager . " You can complete the delivery of the current truckload . I 'm not at all sure you 're competent even for that , but I must risk it . The risk will be largely yours in any case . The ranch foreman will meet you at the southeast entrance to give them safe conduct . Do you know where the southeast entranceis ? " " Yes . Just off the highway . " " Very good . When you 've unloaded , drive the truck back to Bakersfield and lose it . Do n't try to sell it . Leave it in a parking lot and disappear . Can I trust you to do that ? "   " Yes , Mr. Troy . But I have no money . " " Here 's a hundred . " " Only a hundred ? " " You 're lucky to get that , Claude . You can start now . Tell Puddler I want him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let him hurt me , Mr. Troy ? " " Do n't be silly . I would n't let him disarrange a hair of your filthy head . " Claude 's sandals scraped away . This time the light remained . Something pulled at the rope that held my wrists . My hands and forearms were numb , but I could feel the strain in my shoulders . " Lay off ! " The movement of my jaw set off a fit of chattering . I had to clench my teeth to stop it . " You 'll be perfectly all right in a jiffy , " Troy said . " They 've trussed you up like a fowl for market , have n't they ? " I heard a knife whisper through fiber . The tension in my arms and legs was released . They thudded on the cement like pieces of wood . A terrier chill took hold of the back of my neck and shook me . " Do get up , old fellow . " " I like it here . " Sense was returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a slow fire . " You must n't give way to the sulks , Mr. Archer . I warned you once about my associates . If they 've dealt with you rather violently , you must admit that you asked for it . And may I suggest that you sell insurance in a highly unusual way . On a mountaintop , in the very early morning , with a gun in your hand . Among men whose life expectancy is considerablybetter than yours . " I moved my arms on the pavement and kicked my feet together . The blood was moving through them now , like coarse hot rope . Troy stepped back in two quick tapping movements . " The gun in my hand is aimed at the back of your head , Mr. Archer . You may get up slowly , however , if you feel quite able . " I gathered my arms and legs under me and forced my body off the pavement . The room spun and lurched to rest . It was one of the bare cells off the court of the Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . Troy was beside it , as dapper and well groomed as ever , with the same nickelplatedgun . " I gave you the benefit of the doubt last night , " he said . " You 've rather disappointed me . " " I 'm doing my job . " " It seems to conflict with mine . " He moved the gun in his hand as if to punctuate the sentence . " Just what exactly is your job , old man ? " " I 'm looking for Sampson . " " Is Sampson missing ? " I looked into his impassive face , trying to judge how much he knew . His face did n't say . " Rhetorical questions bore me , Troy . The point is that you wo n't gain anything by pulling a second snatch on top of the first . It will pay you to let me go . " " Are you offering me a deal , my dear fellow ? You 're rather low on bargaining power , are n't you ? " " I 'm not working alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Piano tonight . They 're watching Fay 's . Miranda Sampson will be bringing them here today . No matter what you do to me , your racket is finished . Shoot me , and you 're finished . "   " Perhaps you overestimate your importance . " He smiled carefully . " You would n't be considering a percentage of tonight'sgross ? " " Would n't I ? " I was trying to think my way around the gun in his hand . My mind was a little vague . I was putting too much effort into standing up . " Consider my position , " Troy said . " A small-time private eye blunders into my business , not once , but twice in rapid succession . I grin and bear it . Not cheerfully , but I bear it . Instead of killing you , which is my inclination , I offer you a one-third cut of tonight 's gross . Seven hundred dollars , Mr. Archer . " " A one-third cut of tonight 's gross is thirty-three grand . " " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want me to spell it out for you ? " He recovered his poise immediately . " You mentioned thirty-three thousand . That 's a rather grandiose estimate . " " One third of a hundred thousand is thirty-three thousandthree hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents . " " What kind of a shakedown are you trying to pull ? " His voice was anxious and harsh . I did n't like all that tension converging on the gun . " Forget it , " I said . " I would n't touch your money . " " But I do n't understand , " he said earnestly . " And you must n't talk in riddles . It makes me jumpy . It makes my hands nervous . " The gun moved in illustration . " Do n't you know what goes on , Troy ? I thought you knew the angles . " " Assume that I do n't know anything . And talk fast . " " Read it in the papers . "   " I said talk fast . " He raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me about Sampson and a hundred grand . " " Why should I tell you your business ? You kidnapped Sampson two days ago . " " Go on . " " Your driver picked up the hundred grand last night . Was n't it enough ? " " Puddler did that ? " His impassivity had gone for good . A new expression had taken charge of his face , a killer 's expression , cruel and intent . He went to the door and opened it , holding the gun between us . " Puddler ! " His voice rose high and cracked . " The other driver , " I said . " Eddie . " " You 're lying , Archer . " " All right . Wait for the cops to come and tell you in person . They know by now who Eddie was working for . " " Eddie has n't the brains . " " Enough brains for a fall guy . " " What do you mean ? " " Eddie 's in the morgue . " " Who killed him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said slowly . " A hundred grand is a lot of money to a small-timer . " He let it pass . " What happened to the money ? " " Somebody shot Eddie and took it away . Somebody in a cream-colored convertible . " Those three words hit him behind the eyes and turned them blank for an instant . I moved to my right and swatted his gun with the palm of my left hand . It spun to the floor without discharging , and slid to the open door .   Puddler was in at the door and on the gun before me . I backed away . " Do I let him have it , Mr. Troy ? " Troy was shaking his injured hand . It fluttered like a white moth in the circle of light from the lantern . " Not now , " he said . " We 've got to clear out of here , and we do n't want to leave a mess behind us . Take him to the pier on the Rincon . Use his car . Hold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I get it , Mr. Troy . Where are you going to be ? " " I do n't quite know . Is Betty at the Piano tonight ? " " Not when I left . " " Do you know where she lives ? " " Naw  --  she moved the last couple weeks . Somebody lent her a cabin somewheres , I do n't know where  --  " " Is she driving the same car ? " " The convertible ? Yeah . She was last night , anyway . " " I see , " Troy said . " I 'm surrounded by fools and knaves as usual . They ca n't keep their heads out of trouble , can they ? We 'll show them trouble , Puddler . " " Yessir . " " Move , " Troy said to me . CHAPTER 22 : They marched me out to my car . Troy 's Buick was standing beside it . The truck was gone . Claude and the brown men were gone . It was still black night , with the moon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope from the shack beside the adobe .   " Put your hands behind you , " Troy said to me . I kept my hands at my sides . " Put your hands behind you . " " So far I 've been doing my job , " I said . " If you push me around some more , I 'll have a grudge against you . " " You talk a great fight , " Troy said . " Quiet him , Puddler . " I turned to face Puddler , not fast enough . His fist struck the nape of my neck . Pain whistled through my body like splinteredglass , and the night fell on me solidly again . Then I was on a road . The road was crowded with traffic . I was responsiblefor the occupants of every car . I had to write a reporton each , giving age , occupation , hobby , religion , bank balance , sexual proclivities , politics , crimes , and favorite eatingplaces . The passengers changed cars frequently , like people playing musical chairs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ink . A blue truck picked me up and changed to funeral black . Eddie was at the wheel , and I let him drive . I was planning to kill a man . The plan was half complete when I came to . I was wedged on the floor of my car between the front and back seats . The floor was vibrating with motion , and the pain in my head kept time . My hands were bound behind me again . Puddler 's wide back was in the front seat , outlined by the reflection of the headlights . I could n't get to my feet , and I could n't reach him . I tried to work my hands loose from the rope , twisting and pulling until my wrists were raw and my clothes were wet . The rope held out better than I did . I threw my plan away and started another . By dark untraveled roads we came down out of the mountainsand back to the sea . He parked the car under a tarpaulin stretched on poles . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating on the sand . He lifted me out by my coat collar and set me on my feet . I noticed that he pocketed my ignition key . " Do n't make no noise , " he said , " unless you want it again . " " You 've got a lot of guts , " I said . " It takes a lot of guts to hit a man from behind while somebody else holds a gun on him . " " You shut up . " He spread his fingers across my face and hooked them downward . They tasted of sweat , as rank as a horse 's . " It takes a lot of guts , " I said , " to push a man in the face when his hands are tied behind him . " " You shut up . " he said . " I shut you up for good . " " Mr. Troy would n't like that . " " You shut up . Get moving . " He put his hands on my shoulders , turned me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the shore end of a long pier that was built out over the water on piles . There were oil derricks on the skyline behind me , but no lights . No movement but the sea 's , and the systole and diastole of an oil pump at the end of the pier . ' We walked toward it in single file , with Puddler at the rear . The planks of the footwalk were warped and badly put together . Black water gleamed in the cracks . When we were about a hundred yards from shore I made out the pump at the end of the pier , rising and falling like a mechanical teeter-totter . There was a tool shed beside it , nothing but ocean beyond . Puddler unlocked the door of the shed , lifted a lantern off a nail , and lit it . " Sit down , mug . " He swung the lantern toward a heavy bench that stood against the wall . There was a vise at one end of the bench and a few tools scattered along it : pincers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on a clear space . Puddler shut the door and set the lantern on an oil drum . Lit from below by the yellow flaring light , his face was barely human . It was low-browed and prognathous like a Neanderthal man 's , heavy and forlorn , without thought . It was n't fair to blame him for what he did . He was a savage accidentally dropped in the steel-and-concrete jungle , a trained beast of burden , a fighting machine . But I blamed him . I had to . I had to take what he 'd handed me or find a way to hand it back to him . " You 're in a rather unusual position , " I said . He did n't hear me , or refused to answer . He leaned against the door , a thick stump of a man blocking my way . I listened to the thump and creak of the pump outside , the water lappingbelow against the piling . And I thought over the things I knew about Puddler . " You 're in a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lip . " " Acting as jailer , I mean . It 's usually the other way around , is n't it ? You sit in the cell while somebody else watches you : " " I said button your lip . " " How many jails you seen the inside of , dim brain ? " " Fa Christ sake ! " he yelled . " I warned you . " He slouched toward me . " It takes a lot of guts , " I said , " to threaten a man when his hands are tied behind him . " His open hand stung my face . " The trouble with you is you 're yellow , " I said . " Just like Marcie said . You 're even afraid of Marcie , are n't you , Pud-dler ? " He stood there blinking , overshadowing me . " I kill you , hear , you talk like that to me . I kill you , hear . " The words came out disjointed , moving too fast for his laboring mouth . A bubble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't like that . He told you to keep me safe , remember ? There 's nothing you can do to me , Puddler . " " Beat your ears off , " he said . " I beat your cars off . " " Not if my hands were free , you poor palooka . " " Who you calling palooka ? " He drew back his hand again . " You fifth-rate bum , " I said . " You has-been . Down-andouter . Hit a man when he 's tied  --  it 's all you 're good for . " He did n't hit me . He took a clasp knife out of his pocket and opened it . His little eyes were red and shining . His whole mouth was wet with saliva now . " Stand up , " he said . " I show you who 's a bum . " I turned my back to him . He cut the ropes on my wrists and snapped the knife shut . Then he whirled me toward him and met me with a quick right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I was no match for him . I kicked him in the stomach , and he went to the other side of the room . While he was coming back I picked up the file from the bench . Its point was blunt , but it would do . I clinched with him . Holding the file near the point in my right hand , I cut him across the forehead with it from temple to temple . He backed away from me . " You cut me , " he said incredulously . " Pretty soon you wo n't be able to see , Puddler . " A Finnish sailor on the San Pedro docks had taught me how Baltic knife-fighters blind their opponents . " I kill you yet . " He came at me like a bull.  | I went to the floor and came up under him , jabbing with the file where it would hurt him . He bellowed and went down . I made for the door . He came after me and caught me in the opening . We staggered the width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick breath before we struck . We went down together . Puddler fought me violently , but his blows were cushioned by the water . I hooked my fingers in his belt and held on . He threshed and kicked like a terrified animal . I saw his air come out , the silver bubbles rising through the black water to the surface . I held on to him . My lungs were straining for air , my chest was collapsing . The contents of my head were slowing and thickening . And Puddler was n't struggling any more . I had to let go of him to reach the surface in time . One deep breath , and I went down after him . My clothes hamperedme , and the shoes were heavy on my feet . I went down through strata of increasing cold until my ears were aching with the pressure of the water . Puddler was out of reach and out of sight . I tried six times before I gave him up . The key to my car was in his trousers pocket . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I had to crawl out of reach of the surf . It was partly physical exhaustion and partly fear . I was afraid of what was behind me in the cold water . I lay in the sand until my heartbeat slowed . When I got to my feet the derricks on the horizon were sharply outlined against a lightening sky . I climbed the bank to the shelter where my car was and turned on the lights . There was a piece of copper wire attached to one of the poles that held the tarpaulin . I pulled it loose and wired my ignition terminals under the dash . The engine started on the first try . CHAPTER 23 : The sun was over the mountainswhen I reached Santa Teresa . It put an edge on everything , each leaf and stone and blade of grass . From the canyon road the Sampson house looked like a toy villa built of sugar cubes . Closer up I could feel its massive silence , which dominated the place when I stopped the car . I had to unwire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance when I knocked . " Mr. Archer ? " " Is there any doubt about it ? " " You were in an accident , Mr. Archer ? " " Apparently . Is my bag still in the storeroom ? " I had fresh clothes in it , and a duplicate set of car keys . " Yes , sir . There are contusions on your face , Mr. Archer . Should I call a doctor ? " " Do n't bother . I could do with a shower , though , if there 's one handy . " " Yes , sir . I have a shower over the garage . " He led me to his quarters and brought my bag . I showered and shaved in the dinky bathroom , and changed my seasoddenclothes . It was all I could do not to stretch out on the unmade bed in his neat little cell of a room and let the case go hang . When I returned to the kitchen he was setting a tray with a silver breakfast set . " Do you want something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if possible . " He bobbed his round head . " So soon as I have finished with this , sir . " " Who 's the tray for ? " " Miss Sampson , sir . " " So early ? " " She will breakfast in her room . " " Is she all right ? " " I do not know , sir . She had a very little sleep . It was past midnight when she came home . " " From where ? " " I do not know , sir . She left at the same time as you and Mr. Graves . " " Driving herself ? " " Yes , sir . " " What car ? " " The Packard convertible . " " Let 's see , that 's the cream one , is n't it ? " " No , sir . It is red . Bright scarlet . She drove over two hundred miles in the time she was gone . " " You keep a pretty close watch on the family , do n't you , Felix ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my duties to check the cars for gas and oil , sir , since we have no regular chauffeur . " " But you do n't like Miss Sampson very well ? " " I am devoted to her , sir . " His opaque black eyes were their own mask . " Do they give you a rough time , Felix ? " " No , sir . But my family is well known on Samar . I have come to the United States to attend the California PolytechnicCollege when I am able to do this . I resent Mr. Graves 's assumption that I am suspect because of the color of my skin . The gardeners also resent it for themselves . " " You 're talking about last night ? " " Yes , sir . " " I do n't think he meant it that way . " Felix smiled blandly . " Is Mr. Graves here now ? " " No , sir . He is at the sheriff 's office , I think . If you will excuse me , sir ? " He hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ? And do you have to say sir ' every second word ? " " No , sir , " he said with mild irony . " 23665 . " I dialed the number from the butler 's pantry and asked for Graves . A sleepy deputy called him . " Graves speaking . " His voice was hoarse and tired . " This is Archer . " " Where in God 's name have you been ? " " I 'll tell you later . Any trace of Sampson ? " " Not yet , but we 've made some progress . I 'm working with a major case squad from the F.B.I . We wired the classificationof the dead man 's prints to Washington , and we got an answer about an hour ago . He 's in the F.B.I . files with a long record . Name 's Eddie Lassiter . " " I 'll be over as soon as I eat . I 'm at the Sampson place . " " Perhaps you 'd better not . " He lowered his voice . " The sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll come there . " He hung up , and I opened the door to the kitchen . Bacon was making cheerful noises in a pan . Felix transferredit to a warming-dish , inserted bread in the toaster beside the stove , broke the eggs in the hot grease , poured me a cup of coffee from a steaming Silex maker .   I sat down at the kitchen table and gulped the scalding coffee . " Are all the phones in the house on the same line ? " " No , sir . The phones in the front of the house are on a different line from the servants ' phones . Do you wish your eggs turned over , Mr. Archer ? " " I 'll take them the way they are . Which ones are connected with the phone in the pantry ? " " The one in the linen closet and the one in the guest cottageabove the house . Mr. Taggert 's cottage . " Between mouthfuls I asked him : " Is Mr. Taggert there now ? " " I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the night . " " Go and make sure , will you ? " " Yes , sir . " He left the kitchen by the back door . A car drove up a minute later , and Graves came in . He hadlost some of his momentum , but he still moved quickly . Hiseyes were red-rimmed . " You look like hell , Lew . " " I just came from there . Did you bring the dope on Lassiter ? " " Yeah . " He took a teletype flimsy out of his inside pocket and handed it to me . My eye skipped down the closely printed sheet .

Now it was just as if be had never been born . Felix said at my shoulder : " Mr. Taggert is in his cottage , sir . " " Is he up ? " " Yes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Graves said . " Yes , sir . " Graves turned to me . " Is there anything useful in it ? " " Just one thing , and it is n't nailed down . Lassiter had a sister named Betty who was arrested with him on a narcotics charge . There 's a woman named Betty in Los Angeles with narcotics in her record , a pianist in Troy 's clipjoint . She calls herself Betty Fraley . "   " Betty Fraley ! " Felix said from the stove . " This does n't concern you , " Graves told him unpleasantly . " Wait a minute , " I said . " What about Betty Fraley , Felix ? Do you know her ?

" Bulldozing wo n't get us anywhere . Even if Taggert has the woman 's records , it does n't have to mean anything . We 're not even certain she 's Lassiter 's sister . And maybe he 's a collector . " " He has quite a large collection , " Felix said . Graves was stubborn . " I think we should take a look at it . " " Not now . Taggert may be as guilty as hell , but we wo n't get Sampson back by being blunt about it . Wait until Taggertis n't there . Then I 'll look over his records . " Graves let me pull him back into his seat . FIe stroked his closed eyelids with his fingertips . " This case is . the wildest mess I 've ever seen or heard of , " he said . " It is . " Graves only knew the half of it . " Is the general alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Since ten o'clock last night . We 've alerted the highway patrol and the F.B.I. , and every policedepartment and county sheriff between here and , San Diego . "   " You 'd better get on the phone , " I said , " and put out another state-wide alarm . This time for Betty Fraley . Take in the whole Southwest . " He smiled ironically , with his heavy jaw thrust out . " Does n't that fall under the category of bluntness ? " " In this case I think it 's necessary . If we do n't get to Betty fast there 'll be somebody there ahead of us . Dwight Troy is gunning for her . " He gave me a curious look . " Where do you get your information , Lew ? " " I got that the hard way . I talked to Troy himself last night . " " He is mixed up in this , then ? " " He is now . I think he wants the hundred grand for himself , and I think he knows who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a notebook out of his pocket . " That 's my guess . Black hair , green eyes , regular features , five foot two or three , between twenty-five and thirty , probablecocaine addict , thin but well stacked , and pretty if you like to play with reptiles . Wanted on suspicion of the murder of Eddie Lassiter . " He glanced up sharply from his writing . " Is that another guess , Lew ? " " Call it that . Will you put it on the wires ? " " Right away . " He started across the room to the butler 's pantry . " Not that phone , Bert . It 's connected with the one in Taggert 's cottage . " He stopped and turned to me with a shadow of grief on his face . " You seem pretty sure that Taggert 's our man . " " Would it break your heart if he was ? "  | " Not mine , " he said , and turned away . " I 'll use the phone in the study . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front ofthe house until Felix came to tell me that Taggert was eating breakfast in the kitchen . He led me around the back of the garages , up a path that became a series of low stone steps climbing the side of the hill . When we came within sight of the guest cottage , he left me . It was a one-story white frame house perched among trees with its back to the hillside . I opened the unlocked door and went in . The living-room was paneled in yellow pine and furnished with easy chairs , a radio-phonograph , a large refectorytable covered with magazines and piles of records . The view through the big western window took in the whole estate and the sea to the horizon . The magazines on the table were Jazz Record and Downbeat . I went through the records and albums one by one , Decca and Bluebird and Asch , twelve-inch Commodores and Blue Notes . There were many names I had heard of : Fats Waller , Red Nichols , Lux Lewis , Mary Lou Williams  --  and titles I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Drag , Night Life , Denapas Parade . But no Betty Fraley . I was at the door on my way to talk to Felix when I remembered the black disks skipping out to sea the day before . A few minutes after I saw them , Taggert had come through the house in bathing trunks . Avoiding the house , I headed for the shore . From the glassed-in pergola on the edge of the bluff a long flight of concrete steps descended the cliff diagonally to the beach . There was a bath house with a screened veranda at the foot of the steps , and I went in . I found a rubber-and-plate-glass diving mask hanging on a nail in one of the bathhouse cubicles . I stripped to my shorts and adjusted the mask to my head . A fresh offshore breeze was driving in the waves and blowingoff their crests in spray before they broke . The morning sun was hot on my back , the dry sand warm against the soles of my feet . I stood for a minute in the zone of wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at them . The waves were blue and sparkling , curved as gracefully as women , but I was afraid of them . The sea was cold and dangerous . It held dead men . I waded in slowly , pulled the mask down over my face , and pushed off . About fifty yards from shore , beyond the surf , I turned on my back and breathed deeply through my mouth . The rise and fall of the swells , and the extra oxygen , made me a little dizzy . Through the misted glass the blue sky seemed to be spinning over my head . I ducked under water to clear the glass , surface-dived , and breast-stroked to the bottom . It was pure white sand broken by long brown ribs of stone . The sand was roiled a little by the movement of the water , but not enough to spoil the visibility . I zigzagged forty or fifty feet along the bottom and found nothing but a couple of undersized abalones clinging to a rock . I kicked off and went to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man was watching me from the cliff . He ducked down behind the wild-cherry windbreak by the pergola , but not before I had recognized Taggert . I took several deep breaths and dived again . When I came up , Taggert had disappeared . On the third dive I found what I was looking for , an unbroken black disk half buried in the sand of the bottom . Holding the record against my chest , I turned on my back and kicked myself to shore . I took it into the shower and washed and dried it with tender care , like a mother with an infant . Taggert was on the veranda when I came out of the dressing-rooms . He was sitting in a canvas chair with his back to the screen door . In flannel slacks and a white T-shirt , he looked very young and brown . The black hair on his small head was carefully brushed . He gave me a boyish grin that did n't touch his eyes . " Hello there , Archer . Have a nice swim ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You should have used the pool . It 's always warmer . " " I prefer the ocean . You never know what you 're going to find . I found this . " He looked at the record in my hands as if he was noticing it for the first time . " What is it ? " " A record . Somebody seems to have scraped the labels off and thrown it in the sea . I wonder why . " He took a step toward me , long and noiseless on the grass rug . " Let me see . " " Do n't touch it . You might break it . " " I wo n't break it . " He reached for it . I jerked it out of his reach . His hand grasped air . " Stand back , " I said .   " Give it to me , Archer . " " I do n't think so . " " I 'll take it away from you . " " Do n't do that , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stood and looked at me for ten long seconds . Then he turned on the grin again . The boyish charm was very slow in coming . " I was just kidding , man . But I 'd still like to know what 's on the bloody thing . " " So would I. " " Let 's play it then . There 's a portable player here . " He moved around me to the table in the center of the veranda and opened a square fiber box . " I 'll play it , " I said . " That 's right  --  you 're afraid I 'll break it . " He went back to his chair and sat down , stretching his legs in front of him . I cranked the machine and placed the record on the turntable . Taggert was smiling expectantly . I stood and watched him , waiting for a sign , a wrong move . The handsome boy did n't fit into the system of fears I had . He did n't fit into any pattern I knew . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat , half drowned in surface noise . Three or four hackneyed boogie chords were laid down and repeated . Then the right hand wove through them , twisting them alive . The first chords multiplied and built themselves around the room . The place they made was half jungle , half machine . The right hand moved across it and back again like something being chased . Chased through an artificial jungle by the shadow of a giant.  | " You like it ? " Taggert said . " Within limits . If the piano was a percussion instrument it would be first-rate . " " But that 's just the point . It is a percussion instrument if you want to use it that way . " The record ended , and I turned it off . " You seem to be interested in boogie-woogie . You would n't know who made this record ? " " I would n't , no . The style could be Lux Lewis . " " I doubt it . It sounds more like a woman 's playing . " He frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " I do n't know of any woman who can play like that . " " I know of one . I heard her in the Wild Piano night before last . Betty Fraley . " " I never heard of her , " he said . " Come off it , Taggert . This is one of her records . " " Is it ? " " You should know . You tossed it in the sea . Now why would you do that ? " " The question does n't arise , because I did n't do it . I would n't dream of throwing good records away . " " I think you dream a great deal , Taggert . I think you 've been dreaming about a hundred thousand dollars . " He shifted slightly in his chair . His stretched-out pose had stiffened and lost its air of casualness . If someone had lifted him by the nape of the neck , his legs would have stayed as they were , straight out before him in the air . " Are you suggesting that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting that you conspired to do it with Betty Fraley and her brother Eddie Lassiter . "   " I never heard of them , either of them . " He drew a deep breath . " You will . You 'll meet one of them in court , and hear about the other . " " Now just a minute , " he said . " You 're going too fast for me . Is this because I threw those records away ? " " This is your record , then ? " " Sure . " His voice was vibrantly frank . " I admit I had some of Betty Fraley 's records . I got rid of them last night when I heard you talking to the police about the Wild Piano . " " You also listen to other people 's telephone conversa-tions ? " " It was purely accidental . I overheard you when I was trying to make a phone call of my own . " " To Betty Fraley ? " " I told you I do n't know her . " " Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoned her last night to give her the green light on the murder . " " The murder ? " " The murder of Eddie Lassiter . You do n't have to act so surprised , Taggert . " " But I do n't know anything about these people . " " You knew enough to throw away Betty 's records . " " I 'd heard of her , that 's all . I knew she played at the WildPiano . When I heard the police were interested in the place , I got rid of her records . You know how unreasonable they canbe about circumstantial evidence . " " Do n't try to kid me the way you 've kidded yourself , " I said . " An innocent man would never have thought of throwingthose records away . People all over the country have them , have n't they ? "   " That 's just my point . There 's nothing incriminating about them . " " But you thought there was , Taggert . You 'd have had no reason to think of them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing with Betty Fraley . And it happens that you threw them in the sea a good many hours before you heard my phone call  --  before Betty was ever mentioned in connection with this case . " " Maybe I did , " he said . " But you 're going to have a time hanging anything on me on the basis of those records . " " I 'm not going to try to . They put me on to you and served their purpose . So  --  let 's forget about the records and talk about something important . " I sat down in a wicker chair across the veranda from him . " What do you want to , talk about ? " He still had perfect control . His puzzled smile was natural , and his voice was easy . Only his muscles gave him away , bunched at the shoulders , quivering in the thighs . " Kidnapping , " I said . " We 'll leave the murder till later . Kidnapping is just about as serious in this state . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll listen to yours . A great many people will be eager to listen to yours . " " Too bad . I have n't any version . " " I have . I 'd have seen it sooner if I had n't happened to like you . You had more opportunity than anyone , and more motive . You resented Sampson 's treatment of you . You resented all the money he had . You had n't much your-self  --  " " Still have n't , " he said . " You should be well fixed for the present . Half of the hundredthousand is fifty thousand . The very temporary present . "   He spread his hands humorously . " Am I carrying it with me ? " " You 're not that dull , " I said . " But you 're dull enough . You 've acted like a rube , Taggert . The city slickers sucked you in and used you . You 'll probably never see your half of the hundred grand . " " You promised me a story , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down . I showed him my best card . " Eddie Lassiter phoned you the night before you flew Sampson out of Las Vegas . " " Do n't tell me you 're psychic , Archer . You said the man was dead . " But there was a new white line around Taggert 's mouth . " I 'm psychic enough to tell you what you said to Eddie . You told him you 'd be flying into Burbank about three o'clock the next day . You told him to rent a black limousine and wait for your phone call from the Burbank airport . When Sampson phoned the Valerio for a limousine , you canceled the call and sent for Eddie instead . The operator at the Valerio thought it was Sampson calling back . You do a pretty good imitation of him , do n't you ? " " Go on , " he said . " I 've always been fond of fantasy . " " When Eddie turned up at the front of the airport in the rented car , Sampson got in as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . You had him so drunk he would n't notice the difference in drivers  --  so drunk that even a little guy like Eddie could handle him when they got to a private place . What did Eddie use on him , Taggert ? Chloro-form ? " " This is supposed to be your story , " he said . " Is your imaginationgetting tired ? "   " The story belongs to both of us . That canceled telephone call was important , Taggert . It was the thing that tied you into the story in the first place . Nobody else could have known that Sampson was going to phone the Valerio . Nobodyelse knew when Sampson was going to fly in from Nevada . Nobody else was in a position to give Eddie the tip-off the night before . Nobody else could have made all the arrangementsand run them off on schedule . " " I never denied I was at the airport with Sampson . There were a few hundred other people there at the same time . You 're hipped on circumstantial evidence , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't even circumstantial evidence . It 's a circular argument . You have n't got anything on Betty Fraley , and you have n't proved any connection between us . Hundreds of collectors have her records . " His voice was still cool and clear , bright with candor , but he was worried . His body was hunched and tense , as if I had forced him into a narrow space . And his mouth was turning ugly . " It should n't be hard to prove a connection . " I said . " You must have been seen together at one time or another . And was n't it you that called her the other night when you saw me in the Valerio with Fay Estabrook ? You were n't really looking for Sampson at the Wild Piano , were you ? You were going to see Betty Fraley . You put me off when you pulled Puddler out of my hair . I thought you were on my side . So much so that I put it down to stupidity when you fired at the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Taggert ? I 'd call you a smart boy if you had n't dirtied your hands with kidnapping and murder . Stupidity like that cancels out the smartness . "   " If you 're through calling me names , " he said , " we 'll get down to business . " He was still sitting quietly in the canvas chair , but his hand came up from beside him with a gun . It was the .32 target pistol I had seen before , a light gun but heavy enough to make my stomach crawl . " Keep your hands on your knees , " he said . " I did n't think you 'd give up so easily . " " I have n't given up . I 'm simply guaranteeing my freedom of action . " " Shooting me wo n't guarantee it . It 'll guarantee something else . Death by gas . Put your gun away and we 'll talk this over . " " There 's nothing to talk over . " " You 're wrong , as usual . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't answer . Now that the gun was in his hand , ready for violence , his face was smooth and relaxed . It was the face of a new kind of man , calm and unfrightened , because he laid no special value on human life . Boyish and rather innocent , because he could do evil almost without knowing it . He was the kind of man who had grown up and found himself in war . " I 'm trying to find Sampson , " I said . " If I can get him back , nothing else counts . " " You 've gone about it the wrong way , Archer . You forgot what you said last night : if anything happens to the people that kidnapped Sampson , it 's the end of him . " " Nothing has happened to you  --  yet . " " Nothing has happened to Sampson . " " Where is he ? " " Where he wo n't be found until I want him to be . "   " But he was n't alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll take it out on Sampson . " " Sampson is alive , then ? " " According to Taggert he is . " " Who are these others ? " " Eddie Lassiter was one . Betty Fraley is another . There may be more . You 'll be calling the police about this shoot-ing ? " " Naturally . " " Tell them to keep it quiet . " " I 'm not ashamed of it , Lew , " he told me sharply , " though you seem to think I should be . It had to be done , and you know the law on it as well as I do . " " Look at it from Betty Fraley 's point of view . It wo n't be the legal one . When she hears what you 've done to her sidekickshe 'll beeline for Sampson and make a hole in his head . Why should she bother keeping him alive ? She 's got the money  --  " " You 're right , " he said . " We 've got to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And we 've got to find her before she gets to Sampson . Watch yourself , too , Bert . She 's dangerous , and I have an idea that she was gone on Taggert . " " Her , too ? " he said , and after a pause : " I wonder how Miranda 's going to take it . " " Pretty hard . She liked him , did n't she ? " " She had a crush on him . She 's a romantic , you know , and awfully young . Taggert had the things she thought she wanted , youth and good looks and a hell of a combat record . This thing is going to shock her . " " I do n't shock easily , " I said , " but it took me by surprise .   I thought he was a pretty sound kid , a little self-centered but solid . " " You do n't know the type like I do , " Graves said . " I 've seen this same thing happen to other boys , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . They went out of high school into the army or the air corps and made good in a big way . They were officers and gentlemen with high pay , an even higher opinion of themselves , and all the successthey needed to keep it blown up . War was their clement , and when the war was finished , they were finished . They had to go back to boys ' jobs and take orders from middle-aged civilians . Handling pens and adding machines instead of flight sticks and machine guns . Some of them could n't take it and went bad . They thought the world was their oyster and could n't understand why it had been snatched away from them . They wanted to snatch it back . They wanted to be free and happy and successful without laying any foundation for freedom or happiness or success . And there 's the hang-over . " He looked down at the new corpse on the floor . Its eyes were still open , gazing up through the roof at the empty sky . I bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegiac , " I said . " Let 's get out of here . " " In a minute . " He laid his hand on my arm . " I want you to do me a favor , Lew . " " What is it ? " He spoke with diffidence . " I 'm afraid if I tell Miranda about this , she wo n't see it the way it happened . You know what I mean  --  she might blame me . " " You want me to tell her ? "   " I know it 's not your baby , but I 'd appreciate it . " " I can do that , " I said . " I suppose you did save my life . " Mrs. Kromberg was running a vacuum cleaner in the bigfront room . She glanced up when I entered , and switched itoff . " Mr. Graves find you all right ? " " He found me . " Her face sharpened . " Anything wrong ? " " It 's over now . Do you know where Miranda is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes ago . " She led me through the house and left me at the door of a sun-filled room . Miranda was at a window that overlooked the patio . She had daffodils in her hands and was arranging them in a bowl . The yellow flowers clashed with her somber clothes . The only color on her body was a scarlet bow at the neck of her black wool suit . Her small sharp breasts pressed angrily against the cloth . " Good morning , " she said . " I am expressing a wish , not making a statement . " " I understand that . " The flesh around her eyes was swollen and faintly blue . " But I have some moderately good news for you . " " Moderately ? " She raised her round chin , but her mouth remained doleful . " We have some reason to think that your father is alive . " " Where is he ? " " I do n't know . " " Then how do you know he 's alive ? " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talked to one of his kidnappers . " She came at me headlong , clutching at my arm . " What did he say ? "   " That your father is alive . " Her hand released my arm and took hold of her other hand . Her brown fingers interlocked and strained against each other . The daffodils fell to the floor with broken stems . " But you ca n't trust what they say ? They 'd naturally claim he 's alive . What did they want ? Did they phone you ? " " It was just one of them I talked to . Face to face . " " You saw him and let him go ? " " I did n't let him go . He 's dead . His name is Alan Taggert . " " But that 's impossible . I  --  " Her lower lip went slack and showed her lower row of teeth . " Why is it impossible ? " I said . " He could n't do it . He was decent . He was always honest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance came . Then he wanted money morethan anything else . He was ready to murder to get it . " A question formed in her eyes . " You said Ralph was alive ? " " Taggert did n't murder your father . IIe tried to murderme . " " No , " she said . " He was n't like that . That woman twisted him . I knew she 'd ruin him if he went with her . " " Did Taggert tell you about her ? " " Of course he told me . He told me everything . " " And you still loved him ? " " Did I say I loved him ? " Her mouth was firm again and curved with pride . " I understood you did . " " That stupid gawk ? I used him for a while . He served the purpose . " " Stop it , " I said violently . " You ca n't fool me , and you ca n't fool yourself . You 'll tear yourself to pieces . "   Yet her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . Still as a tree bent out of line and held there by a continuous wind . The wind pushed her against me . Her feet trampled the daffodils . Her mouth closed over mine . Her body held me close from breast to knee , too long and not long enough . " Thank you for killing him , Archer . " Her voice was anguishedand soft , the kind of voice a wound would have if it could speak . I took her by the shoulders and held her off . " You 're wrong . I did n't kill him . " " You said he was dead , that he tried to murder you . " " Albert Graves shot him . " " Albert ? " Her giggle passed back and forth like a quick spark between laughter and hysteria . " Albert did that ? " " He 's a dead shot  --  we used to do a lot of target-shooting together , " I said . " If he was n't , I would n't be here with you now . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes me a little sick . You 're trying to swallow these things without going to pieces , and you ca n't get them down . " Her glance traveled down my body , and she grinned as much like a monkey as a pretty girl could . " Did it make you sick when I kissed you ? " " You could tell it did n't . But it 's confusing to be in a room with five or six competing personalities . " " Sick-making , you mean , " she said with her monkey grin . " You 'll be the sick one if you do n't settle down . Find out what you feel about this business , and have a good cry , or you 'll end up schizo. "  | " I always was a schizoid type , " she said . " But why should I cry , Herr Doktor ? " " To see if you can . " " You do n't take me seriously , do you , Archer ? " " I ca n't afford to put my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'm sick-making , I 'm schizo , I 'm split wood . What do you really think of me ? " " I would n't know . I 'd have a better idea if you 'll tell me where you went last night . " " Last night ? Nowhere . " " I understand you did a lot of driving in the red Packard convertible last night . " " I did , but I did n't go anywhere . I was just driving . I wanted to be by myself to make up my mind . " " About what ? " " About what I 'm going to do . Do you know what I 'm going to do , Archer ? " " No . Do you ? " " I want to see Albert , " she said . " Where is he ? " " In the bathhouse , where it happened . Taggert 's there , too . " " Take me to Albert . " We found him on the screened veranda sitting over the dead man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taggert 's face , which was still uncovered , and listening to Graves 's story . All three stood up for Miranda . She had to step over Taggert in order to reach Albert Graves . She did this without a downward glance at the uncoveredface . She took one of Graves 's hands between hers and raised it to her lips . It was his right hand she kissed , the one that had fired the gun.  | " I 'll marry you now , " she said . Whether Graves knew it or not , he 'd had his reason for shooting Alan Taggert through the head . CHAPTER 26 : For half a minute nobody spoke . The lovers stood together above the body . The others stood and watched them . " We 'd better get out of here , Miranda , " Graves said finally . He glanced at the District Attorney . " If you 'll excuse us ? Mrs. Sampson will have to be told about this . " " Go ahead , Bert , " Humphreys said . While a man from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , Humphreys questioned me . His questions covered the ground quickly and thoroughly . I told him who Taggert was , how he died , and why he had to die . Sheriff Spanner listened restlessly , biting a cigar to shreds . " There will have to be an inquest , " Humphreys said . " You and Bert are in the clear , of course . Taggert had a deadly weapon in his hand and was obviously intending to use it . Unfortunately this shooting leaves us worse off than before . We have practically no leads . " " You 're forgetting Betty Fraley . " " I 'm not forgetting her . But we have n't caught her , and even if we do , we ca n't be certain that she knows where Sampson is . The problem has n't changed , and we 're no nearer to its solution than we were yesterday . The problem is to find Sampson . "  | " And the hundred thousand dollars , " Spanner said . Humphreys looked up impatiently . " The money is secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a hundred thousand in cash is always important . " He tugged at his elastic lower lip . Ilis gray eyes shifted to me . " If you 're finished with Archer here , I want to have a talk with him . " " Take him , " Humphreys said coldly . " I 've got to get back to town . " He took the body with him . When we were alone the sheriff got up heavily and stood over me . " Well ? " I said . " What 's the trouble , Sheriff ? " " Maybe you can tell me . " He folded his thick arms across his chest . " I 've told you what I know . " " Maybe so . You did n't tell me everything you should of last night . I heard from your friend Colton this morning . lIe told me about the limousine this Lassiter was driving : it came from a car-rental in Pasadena , and you knew it . " I lc raised his voice suddenly , as if he hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me you saw it before , when the ransom note was delivered . " " I saw one like it . I did n't know it was the same car . " " But you guessed it was . You told Colton it was . You gave the information to an officer that could n't use it because he 's got no jurisdiction in this county . But you did n't tell me , did you ? If you had , we could have taken him . We could have stopped the shooting and saved the money  --  " " But not Sampson , " I said . " You 're not the judge of that . " His face was bursting at the seams with angry blood . " You took things in your own hands and interfered with my duty . You withheld information . Right after Lassiter got shot , you disappeared . You were the only witness , and you disappeared . A hundred thousand dollars disappeared at the same time . " " I do n't like the implication . " I stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . " You do n't like it . How do you think I like it ? I 'm not saying you took the money  --  that remains to be seen . I 'm not saying you shot Lassiter . I 'm saying you could have . I want your gun , and I want to know what you were doing when my deputy caught up with you down south . And I want to know what you were doing after that . " " I was looking for Sampson . " " You were looking for Sampson , " he said , with heavy irony . " You expect me to take your word for that . " " You do n't have to take my word . I 'm not working for you . " He leaned toward me with his hands on his hips . " If I wanted to be ugly , I could put you away this minute . " My patience broke .

" The blood went out of his face , leaving it haggard with rage . " They 'll hear about this in Sacramento , " he stuttered . " When your license comes up  --  " " I 've heard that one before . I 'm still in business , and I 'll tell you why . I 've got a clean record , and I do n't push people around until they start to push me. "  | " So you 're threatening me ! " His right hand fumbled forthe holster on his hip . " You 're under arrest , Archer . " I sat down and crossed my legs . " Take it easy , Sheriff . Sitdown and relax . We 've got some things to talk over . " " I 'll talk to you at the courthouse . " " No , " I said . " Here . Unless you want to take me to the immigrant inspector . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wrinkled up his eyelids in an effort to look shrewd , and succeeded in looking puzzled . " You 're not an alien ? " " I 'm a native son , " I said . " Is there an immigrant inspector in town ? " " Not in Santa Teresa . The nearest ones are at the federal office in Ventura . Why ? " " Do you do much work with them ? " " A fair amount . When I pick up an illegal alien I turn him over . You trying to kid me , Archer ? " " Sit down , " I said again . " I did n't find what I was looking for last night , but I found something else . It should make you and the inspectors very happy . I 'm offering it to you as a free gift , no strings . " He lowered his haunches into the canvas chair . His anger had passed off suddenly , and curiosity had taken its place . " What is it ? It better be good . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men at the Temple , Troy and Eddie and Claude . " Troy is the head of the gang , I 'm pretty sure . The others work for him . They 've been running an underground railway on a regular schedule between the Mexican border and the Bakersfield area . The southern end is probably at Calexico . " " Yeah , " Spanner said . " That 's an easy place to cross the border . I took a trip down there with the border guard a couple of months ago . All they got to do is crawl through a wire fence from one road to the other . " " And Troy 's truck would be waiting to pick them up . They used the Temple in the Clouds as a receiving station for illegalimmigrants . God knows how many have passed through there . There were twelve or more last night . " " Are they still there ? " " They 're in Bakersfield by now , but they should n't be hard to round up . If you get hold of Claude I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spanner said . " If , they brought over twelve a night , that 's three hundred and sixty a month . Do you know how much they pay to get smuggled in ? " " No . " " A hundred bucks apiece . This Troy has been making big money . " " Dirty money , " I said . " Trucking in a bunch of poor Indians , taking their savings away , and turning them loose to be migrant laborers . " He looked at me a little queerly . " They 're breaking the law , too , do n't forget . We do n't prosecute , though , unless they got criminal records . We just ship them back to the border and let them go . But Troy and his gang are another matter . What they been doing is good for thirty years . " " That 's fine , " I said . " You do n't know where he hangs out in Los Angeles ? " " He runs a place called the Wild Piano , but he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " With two exceptions : the man I had killed , and the blond woman who would still be waiting for Eddie.  | " You seem to be on the level , " the sheriff said slowly . " You can forget what I said about arrest . But if this turns out to be a song-and-dance you gave me , I 'll remember it again . " I had n't expected to be thanked , and I was n't disappointed . I parked in the lane under theeucalyptus trees . The marks of the truck tires were still visiblein the dust . Further down the lane a green A-model sedan , acned with rust , was backed against a fence post . On the registrationcard strapped to the steering gear I read the name , " Mrs. Marcella Finch . " The moonlight had been kind to the white cottage . It was ugly and mean and dilapidated in the noon sun , a dingy blot against the blue field of the sea . Nothing iii sight lived or moved , except the sea itself and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside . I felt for my gun butt . The dry dust muffled my footsteps . The door creaked partly open when I knocked . A woman 's voice said dully : " Who 's that ? " I stood aside and waited , in case she had a gun . She raised her voice . " Is somebody there ? " " Eddie , " I whispered . Eddie had no further use for his name , but it was a hard thing to say . " Eddie ? " A hushed and wondering word . I waited . Her sibilant feet crossed the floor . Before I could see her face in the dim interior , her right hand grasped the edge of the door . Under the peeling scarlet polish , her fingernailswere dirty . I took hold of her hand .   " Eddie ! " The face that looked around the door was blind with the sun and a desperate hopefulness . Then she blinked and saw I was n't Eddie . She had aged rapidly in twelve hours . She was puffed around the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waiting for Eddie had drained away her life . A kind of galvanifury took its place . Her nails bit into my hand like parrot 's claws . She squawked like a parrot : " Dirty liar ! " The name hit me hard , but not as hard as a bullet . I caught her other wrist and forced her back into the house , slamming the door with my heel . She tried to knee me , then to bite my neck . I pushed her down on the bed . " I do n't want to hurt you , Marcie . " From a round open mouth she screamed up into my face . The scream broke down in dry hiccuping . She flung herself sideways , burrowing under the covers . Her body moved in a rhythmic orgasm of grief . I stood above her and listened to the dry hiccuping . Filtered through dirty windows , reflected from rain-stained walls and shabby furniture , the light in the room was gray . On top of an old battery radio beside the bed there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up after a while and lit a brown cigarette , dragging deep . Iler bathrobe gaped open as if her slack breasts did n't matter any more . The voice that came out with the smoke was contemptuousand flat . " I should stage a crying jag to give a copper his kicks . " " I 'm no copper . " " You know my name . I been waiting all morning to hear from the law . " She looked at me with cold interest . " How low can you bastards get ? You blow Eddie down when he ai n't even heeled . Then you come and tell me you 're Eddie at the door . For a minute you make me think the newscast was wrong or you bastards was bluffing again . Can you get any lower than that ? " " Not much , " I said . " I thought you might answer the door with a gun . " " I got no gun . I never carried a gun , nor Eddie neither . You would n't be walking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his grave . " The flat voice broke again . " Maybe I 'll waltz on yours , copper . " " Be quiet for a minute . Listen to me . " " Gladly , gladly . " The voice recaptured its tinny quality . " You 'll be doing all the talking from now on . You can lock me up and throw away the key . You wo n't get nothing out of me . " " Douse the muggles , Marcie . I want you to talk some sense . " She laughed and blew smoke in my face . I took the halfburnedcigarette from her fingers and ground it under my heel . The scarlet claws reached for my face . I stepped back , and she lapsed onto the bed . " You must have been in on it , Marcie . You knew what Eddie was doing ? " " I deny everything . He had a job driving a truck . He trucked beans from the Imperial Valley . " She stood up suddenly and threw off her bathrobe. " ' fake me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything formal . " " I do n't belong to headquarters . " When she raised her arms to pull a dress over her head ,   her body drew itself up , the breasts erect , the belly taut and white . The hair on her body was black . " Like it ? " she said . She pulled the dress down with a vicious gesture and fumbled with the buttons at the neck . Her streaked blond hair was down around her face . " Sit down , " I said . " We 're not going anywhere . I came here to tell you a thing . " " Are n't you a copper ? " " You repeat yourself like Puddler . Listen to me . I want Sampson . I 'm a private cop hired to find him . He 's all I want  --  do you understand ? If you can give him to me , I 'll keep you in the clear . " " You 're a dirty liar , " she said . " I would n't trust a cop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where Sampsonis . " I looked hard into her bird-brown eyes . They were shallow and meaningless . I could n't tell from them if she was lying . " You do n't know where Sampson is  --  " " I said I did n't . " " But you know who does . " She sat down on the bed . " I do n't know a damn thing . I told you that . " " Eddie did n't do it by himself . He must have had a part-ner . " " He did it by himself . If he did n't  --  would you take me for a squealer ? Do I go to work for the cops after what they done to Eddie ? " I sat down in the barrel chair and lit a cigarette . " I 'll tell you a funny thing . I was there when Eddie was shot . There was n't a cop within two miles , unless you count me . " " You killed him ? " she said thinly .   " I did not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another car . It was a cream-colored convertible . It had a woman in it . She shot him . Where would that woman be now ? " Her eyes were glistening like wet brown pebbles . The red tip of her tongue moved across her upper lip and shifted to her lower lip . " Ever since she was on the white stuff , " she said to herself . " They allus hate us vipers . " " Are you going to sit and take it , Marcie ? Where is she ? " " I do n't know who you 're talking about . " " Betty Fraley , " I said . After a long silence she repeated : " I do n't know who you 're talking about . " I left her sitting on the bed and drove back to the Corner . I parked in the parking lot and lowered the sun screen over the windshield . She knew my face but not my car . For half an hour the road from White Beach was empty . Then a cloud of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedan . Before the car turned south toward Los Angeles I caught a glimpse of a highly painted face , a swirl of gray fur , an aggressively tilted hat with a bright-blue feather . Clothes and cosmetics and half an hour alone had done a lot for Marcie . Two or three other cars went by before I turned into the highway . The A model 's top speed was under fifty , and it was easy to keep in sight . Driving slow on a hot clay , down a highwayI knew too well , the only trouble I had was staying awake . I narrowed the distance between us as we approached Los Angelesand the traffic increased . The A model left the highway at Sunset Boulevard and went through Pacific Palisades without a pause . It labored and trailed dark-blue oil smoke on the hills below the Santa Monica Mountains . On the edge of Beverly Hills it left the boulevard suddenly and disappeared . I followed it up a winding road lined on both sides with hedges . The A model was parked behind a laurel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant of passing I saw Marcie crossing the lawn toward a deep brick porch screened with oleanders . She seemed to be thrust forward and hustled along by a deadly energy . CHAPTER 28 : I turned at the next drive andparked on the shoulder of the road , waiting for a signal to break the suburban peace . The seconds piled up precariously like a tower of poker chips . I had the car door open and one foot in the road when the Ford engine coughed . I drew in my leg and crouched down behind the wheel . The Ford engine roared and went into gear , then died away . A deeper sound took its place , and the black Buick backed out of the drive . A man I did n't know was at the wheel . The eyes in his fleshy face were like raisins stuck in unbaked dough . Marcie was beside him in the front seat . Gray hearselike curtains were drawn over the rear windows . At the boulevard the Buick turned back toward the sea . I followed as closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the right , up a climbing road that led into a canyon . I had the feeling that there was n't much mileage left in the Sampson case . We were coming into a narrow place for the end . The road was cut in the western wall of the canyon . Belowits unfenced edge was a tangle of underbrush . Above the road to my left a scattering of houses stood in roughly cleared patches . The houses were new and raw-looking . The opposite slope was scrub-oak wilderness . From the top of a rise I caught a glimpse of the Buick climbing over the crest of the next hill . I accelerated on the downhill grade , crossed a narrow stone bridge that spanned a dry barranca , and climbed the hill after it . It was moving slowly down the other side , like a heavy black beetle feeling its way in unfamiliar territory . A rutted lane branched off to the right . The beetle paused and followed it . I parked behind a tree , which half hid my car from below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no larger than an actual beetle , it stopped iii front of a yellow matchbox house . A matchstick woman with a black head came out of the house . Two men and two women got out of the car and surrounded her . All five went into the house like a single insect body with many legs . I left my car and climbed down through the underbrush to the dry river bed at the bottom of the canyon . It wound among boulders from which small lizards scampered as I came near . The gnarled trees along the bank hid me from the yellow house until I was directly behind it . It was an unpaintedwooden shack with its rear end resting on short fieldstonecolumns . Inside it a woman screamed , very loudly , again and again . The screams raked at my nerves , but I was grateful for them . They covered the noises I made climbing the bank and crawl- ing under the house . The screaming died away after a while . I lay flat and listened to scrabbling movements on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be crouched and waiting for another scream . I smelled new pine , damp earth , my own sour sweat . A soft voice began to talk over my head . " You do n't quite understand the circumstances . You seem to feel that our motiveis pure sadism or simple revenge . Certainly if we were inclined to harbor vengeful motives , we might feel that your conduct had justified them . " " Tie a can to it , for Christ 's sake ! " said Mrs. Estabrook 's voice . " This is n't getting , us anywhere . " " I 'll make my point if you do n't mind . My point is , Betty , that you 've acted very badly . Without consulting me , you went into business for yourself , a thing I seldom approve in my employees . To make matters worse , you made an incautiouschoice of enterprise and failed in it . The police are looking for you now , and for me and Fay and Luis as well . Furthermore , you chose a valuable associate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to cap the climax you showed yourself devoid , not only of esprit de corps , but of sisterly affection . You shot and killed your brother Eddie Lassiter . " " We know you swallowed the dictionary , " Fay Estabrook said . " Get on with it , Troy . " " I did n't kill him . " The whine of a hurt cat . " You 're a liar , " yapped Marcie . Troy raised his voice . " Be quiet , all of you . We 're going to let bygones be bygones , Betty  --  " " I 'm going to kill her if you do n't , " Marcie said . " Nonsense , Marcie . You 'll do exactly as I say . We have a chance to recoup , and we wo n't allow our more primitive passionsto destroy it . Which brings us to the occasion of this pleasant little party , does n't it , Betty ? I do n't know where the money is , but of course I am going to . And when I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " " She ai n't fit to live , " Marcie said . " I swear I 'll kill her if you do n't . " Fay laughed contemptuously . " You have n't got the guts , dearie . You would n't have called us in if you had the guts to tackle her yourself . " " Hold your tongue , both of you . " Troy lowered his voice to a gentle monotone again . " You know I can liandlc Marcie , do n't you , Betty ? I think you know by now I rill handle even you . You might just as well come clean , I think . Otherwise you 'll suffer rather terribly . You may never walk again , in fact . I think I can promise you that you never shall . " " I 'm not talking , " she said . " But if you decide to co-operate , " Troy went on smoothly , " to put the welfare of the group ahead of your selfish interest , I 'm sure the group will be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the country tonight , in fact . You know that Luis and I can do that for you . " " You would n't do it , " she said . " I know you , Troy . " " More intimately by the moment , dear . ' Fake off her other shoe , Luis . " Her body squirmed on the floor . I could hear its breathing . A dropped shoe rapped the floorboards . I calculated my chances of ending it there . But there were four of them , too many for one gun . And Betty Fraley had to come out alive . Troy said : " We 'll test the plantar reflex , I think it 's called . " " I do n't like this , " Fay said .   " Neither do I , my dear . I quite abhor it . But Betty is being most dreadfully obdurate . " A moment of silence stretched out like membrane on the point of tearing . The screaming began again . When it ended I found that I had closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very fine , " Troy said . " It 's a pity that your tongue does n't work so well . " " Will you let me go if I give it to you ? " " You have my word . " " Your word ! " She sighed horribly . " I do wish you 'd take it , Betty . I do n't enjoy hurting you , and you ca n't possibly enjoy being hurt . " " Let me up , then . Let me sit up . " " Of course , my dear . " " It 's in a locker in the bus station in Buenavista . The key is in my bag . " As soon as I was out of sight of the house I began to run . When I reached my car the Buick was still standing at the end of the lane below me . I backed down the hill to the stone bridge and halfway up the grade on the other side . I waited for the Buick with one foot on the clutch and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its motor whining up the other side of the hill . I went into gear and moved ahead in low . Its chromium flashed in the sun at the top of the hill . I held the middle of the road and met it on the bridge . Brakes screeched above the bellow of the horn . The big car came to a stop five feet from my bumper . I was out of my seat before it stopped rolling . The man called Luis glared at me over the wheel , his fat face twisted and shiny with anger . I opened the door on his side and showed him my gun . Beside him Fay Estabrook cried out in fury . " Out ! " I said . Luis put one foot down and reached for inc . I moved back . " Be careful . Hands on your head . " He raised his hands and stepped into the road . An emerald ring flashed green on one of his fingers . His wide hips swayed under his cream gabardine suit . " You too , Fay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her high heels . " Now turn around . " They rotated cautiously , watching me over their shoulders . I clubbed the gun and swung it to the base of Luis 's skull . Ile went down on his knees and collapsed softly on his face . Fay cowered away with her arms protecting hei head . Iler hat slipped forward dowdily over one eye . On the road her long shadow mocked her movements . " Put him in the back seat , " I said . " You dirty little sneak ! " she said . Then she said other things . The rouge stood out on her cheekbones . " Hurry . " " I ca n't lift him . " " You have to . " I took a step toward her . She stooped awkwardly over the fallen man . lle was inert , and heavy . With her hands in his armpits she raised the upper part of his body and dragged him to the car . I opened the door , and together we slung him into the back seat . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . The rustic stillness of the sun-filled canyon made a queer setting for what we were doing . I could see the two of us as if from a height , tiny foreshortened figures alone in the sun , with blood and money on our minds . " Now give me the key . " " The key ? " She overdid her puzzled frown , making her face a caricature . " What key ? " " The key to the locker , Fay . Hurry . " " I have n't got any key . " But her gaze had flickered almost imperceptibly toward the front seat of the Buick . There was a black suede purse on the seat . The key was in it . I transferred it to my wallet . " Get in , " I said . " No , on the driver 's side . You 're going to do the driving . " She did as I said , and I got in behind her . Luis was slumped in the far corner of the back seat . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight . His face looked more than ever like dough . " I ca n't get past your car , " Fay said petulantly . " You 're backing up the hill . " She went into reverse gear with a jerk . " Not so fast , " I said . " If we have an accident you wo n't survive it . " She cursed me , but she also slowed down . She backed cautiously up the hill and down the other side . At the entrance to the lane I told her to turn and drive down to the cottage . " Slow and careful , Fay . No leaning on the horn . You would n't be any good without a spinal column , and Geminis have no heart . " I touched the back of her neck with the muzzle of my gun . She winced , and the car leaped forward . I rested my weightP211on Luis and lowered the rear window on the right side . The lane opened out in a small level clearing in front of the cottage . " Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the door . Then set the emergency . " The door of the cottage began to open inward . I clucked my head . When I raised it again , Troy was in the doorway , with his right hand , knuckles out , resting on the edge of the frame . I sighted and fired . At twenty feet I could see the mark the bullet made , like a fat red insect alighting , between the first and second knuckles of his right hand . Before his left hand could move across his body for his gun he was immobile for an instant . Long enough for me to reach him and use the gun butt again . He sat down on the doorstep , with his silver head hanging between his knees . The motor of the Buick roared behind me . I went after Fay , caught the car before she could turn it , and pulled her out by the shoulders . She tried to spit at me and slobbered on her chin . " We 'll go inside , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbling on her heels . Troy had rolled out of the doorway and was curled on the shallow porch , perfectly still . We stepped over him . The odor of burned flesh was still iii the room . Betty Fraley was on the floor with Marcie at her throat , worrying her like a terrier . I pulled Marcie off . She hissed at me and drummed her heels on the floor , but she , did n't try to get up . I motioned to Fay with the gun to stand in the corner beside her . Betty Fraley sat up , the breath whistling in her throat . Across one side of her face. , from hairline to jawbone , four parallel scratches dripped blood . The other side of her face was yellowish white . " You 're a pretty picture , " I said . " Who are you ? " Her voice was a flat caw . Her eyes were fixed . " It does n't matter . Let 's get out of here before I have to kill these people . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to stand up and fell forward on hands and knees . " I ca n't walk . " I lifted her . Her body was light and hard as a dry stick . Her head hung loosely across my arm . I had the feeling that I was holding an evil child . Marcie and Fay were watching me from the corner . It seemed to me then that evil was a female quality , a poison that women secreted and transmitted to men like disease . I carried Betty out to the car and sot her down in the front seat . I opened the back door , laid Luis out on the ground . There were suds on his thick blue lips , blown in and out by his shallow breathing . " Thank you , " her tiny caw said , as I climbed behind the wheel . " You saved my life , if that 's worth anything . " " It is n't worth much , but you 're going to pay me for it . The price is a hundred thousand  --  and Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the entrance to the bridge and kept the ignition key . As I lifted Betty Fraley out of the seat her right arm slipped around my shoulders . I could feel her small fingers on the nape of my neck . " You 're very strong , " she said . " You 're Archer , are n't you ? " She looked up at me with a sly and feline innocence . She did n't know about the blood on her face . " It 's time you remembered me . Take your hand off me , or I 'll drop you . " She lowered her eyelids . When I started to back my car she cried out suddenly : " What about them ? " " We do n't have room for them . " " You 're going to let them go ? " " What do you want me to hold them for ? Mayhem ? " I found a wide place in the road and turned the car toward Sunset Boulevard . Her fingers pinched my arm . " We 've got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands off mc . I do n't like what you did to Eddie any more than they do . " " But they 've got something of mine ! " " No , " I said . " I have it , and it is n't yours any iuore . " " The key ? " " The key . " She slumped down in the seat as if her spine had incited . " You ca n't let them go , " she said sullenly . " After what they did to me . You let Troy run loose , and he 'll get you for to-day . " " I do n't think so , " I said . " Forget about them and start worrying about yourself . " " I have n't got a future to worry about . I lave I ? " " I want to see Sampson first . Then I 'll decide . " " I 'll take you to him . "  | " Where is he ? " " Not very far from home . He 's in a place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is straight ? " " The straight stuff , Archer . But you wo n't let me go . You wo n't take money , will you ? " " Not from you . " " Why should you ? " she said nastily . " You 've got my hundredgrand . " " I 'm working for the Sampsons . They 'll get it back . " " They do n't need the money . Why do n't you get smart , Archer ? There 's another person in this with me . This other person had nothing to do with Eddie . Why do n't you keep the money and split it with this other person ? " " Who is he ? " " I did n't say it was a man . " Her voice had recovered from the pressure of Marcie 's fingers , and she modulated it girlishly . " You could n't work with a woman . Who 's the man ? " She did n't know that Taggert was dead , and it was n't the time to tell her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could trust you . I must be going soft in the head . " " Maybe you are . You have n't told me where Sampson is . The longer it takes you to tell me , the less I 'll feel like doing anything for you . " " He 's in a place on the beach about ten miles north of Buenavista . It used to be the dressing-room of a beach club that folded during the war . " " And he 's alive ? " " He was yesterday . The first day he was sick from the chloroform , but he 's all right now . "  | " He was yesterday , you mean . Is he tied up ? " " I have n't seen him . Eddie was the one . " " I suppose you left him there to starve to death . " " I could n't go there . He knew me by sight . Eddie was the one he did n't know . " " And Eddie died by an act of God . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll never be able to prove it , though . I was n't thinking of Sampsonwhen I shot Eddie . " " You were thinking of money , were n't you ? A two-way cut instead of a three-way cut . " " I admit it was partly that , but only partly . Eddie pushed me around all the time I was a kid . When I finally got on my feet and was heading places , he sang me into the pen . I was using the stuff , but he was selling it . Ile helped the feds to hang conspiracy on me , and got off with a light sentence himself . He did n't know I knew that , but I promised myself to get him . I got him when he thought he was riding high . Maybe he was n't so surprised . He told Marcie where to find me if anything went wrong . " " It always does , " I said . " Kidnappings do n't conic off . Especiallywhen the kidnappers start murdering each of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first gasstation I came to . She watched me remove the ignition key .

" " It used to be the Sunland Beach Club . It 's a long green building . You can see it from the highway , out near the end of a little point . "
