txt The other day a burly truck drive ! stormed Into his local rationing board and shouted : " Rules or no rules . I got ta have a tire . " " George . " the rationing board chairman said , " we ca n't give you a tile . You haul slag away from an open hearth steel furnace , and you also deliver soda ' pop The 0 P A. says tires go only to trucks hauling things like farm products , fuel . waste , raw materials or munitions . " Even if we defined slag as waste , it would n't work , because your truck isa t devoted exclusively to that purpose . " It 's like what we said in the letter You do n't qualify " " Look . " said the truck driver . " I would n't know about that . But all this rationing stuff is based on aiding the war effort . is n't it ? Well . the war effort needs steel , does n't it ? And if I do n't haul slag away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see ? " The local rationing board saw . The truck driNcr got his tire , the carefully drawn rules of the O.F.A. to the contrary notwithstanding %hat to Unlearn About Rationing His case is typical of thousands which daily a re making mincemeat of the O.P.A. s carefully-drawn rationing rules and standards . It is R text fora sermon on Government regulation The truck driver 's experience also demonstrates what more and more citizens , seeking not only tires but sugar and soon other commodities , are going to learn about rationing 1 . Rationing strictly by theoretical rules does n't work 2 . Local rationing board s ideas of common sense and not the 0 P A standards often decide who gets what . This implies no criticism of the O.P.A. standards . which are necessary as a base for rationing And the 0 P.A officials themselves realize that local boards must use R lot of discretion if the program is to work . No objections have been raised , even , to the rationing administrator in Pennsylvania who supplemented the A. rationing rules from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ell ? g-ible for tires and automobiles . Rule O'Thumb Ruled Out In fact , the areas in the country that have caused 0 P.A. most rationing headaches are those where local boards have followed the rules too closely . Following the rationing rules closely produces some strange results . For example . trucks delivering beer to retailers are entitled to tires , but trucks delivering milk to homes are not The majority of applications for tires , 01 course , have been decided by the rationing boards in a routine way . Either they do or they do not fall within one of ** classifications of eligible The headaches come on border-line cases . instances like the truck driver , who doesn t qualify but who really needs a tire mote than some of the eligibles . Some of these cases are referred to higher authorities fot an opinion But , more often than not , the local rationing board goes ahead and makes a decision on its own hook When it does so , it becomes a quasi-judicial agency . Al important to the every-day lives of average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion exercised by local rationing boards is seen here in Washington , where diplomacy is often mixed with economics when envoys of foreign countries seek new tires . The tires usually go to the diplomats whose countries are most friendly to the United States Rationing Board 's wheels Go ' Round Here is the way a typical tire rationing board works : its members are often a doctor , a lawyer and a garage owner . They have before them when they meet a pile of applications from persons who have gotten the initial okay from an inspector at a garage that they need a new tire . The chairman reads the applications rapidly , merely indicating by which folder he places them in whether the request for tires has been granted or denied . How strict the board is depends , at least in part , on the number of application. , and the size of its monthly quota . l aually , the board is unanimous . Then comes the application of Mrs. Smith . Mrs. Smith makes a living by taking care of sick people . particularly those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse , but she cares for a ' half dozen patients in widely scattered sections of the city , she needs a tire . " Under the rules , " says the lawyer , " we ca n't given this lady a tire unless she is a regular nurse . And she 's not . " The doctor speaks up : " I know , but she is doing a good work And there is apt to be a polio epidemic any time now . She is going to have more patients , and most of the nurses that are n't in hospitals are in the Army . Mrs Smith performs a publicly important function if anybody does . " - Well , - says the chair man , " I 'm willing to give her a tire if you are " The doctor and the lawyer said they were and Mrs. Smith got her tire . The next application is from a doctor . He is clearly entitled to a tire under the 0 . P A. rules But up speaks the doctor-member of the board . " Watt a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He is an X-ray specialist with an office downtown . He never calls on patients , and he does n't need a tire . " So the doctor 's application was rejected Word to the Wise Another rationing board was handling applications for bus tires . One was from a real estate man . who used his nine-passenger station wagon to take children living in his suburban development to a nearby school . He also used the car in business . The rules permit tires only for such vehicles with capacity for 10 passengers and used exclusively for a permitted purpose , like transportation of students in sc hoot . But the realtor got his tire nevertheless There are several instances where the rationers step out of character momentarily to advise an applicant on the best tactics to use . The owner of ri fleet of 10 trucks came in . Six of his trucks were used exclusively in hauling material used by several munitions plants . The other four were relief trucks . used part of the time making deliveries of all kinds . He wanted a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible under the rules . The rationing board chairman asked him if he could n't possibly find some of the bad tires on his munitions trucks . Oh no , he replied quickly , those tires are all right . " Look . " sa.d the chairman . " We ca n't give you tires for those relief trucks But if you went home . changed the bad tires to the munitions trucks , then came in and made out a new application , maybe we could help you . " " Oh " said the man , and he ultimately got his ties . The rationing boards generally appear to be more willing to relax the rules for trucks than for passenger cars . This factor is causing concern in various offices of U S Marshalls around the country . Deputy marshalls use their own cars for business , for transporting prisoners . serving subpoenas and making arrests They are paid on a mileage basis . But under the tire rationing regulations they ca n't get tires unless their cars are used exclusively for Government business . The federal courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer has always been toe same : " No tiles . " In this case . it may take an official action by the O. P. A. to prevent a breakdown of enforcement of court orders .
