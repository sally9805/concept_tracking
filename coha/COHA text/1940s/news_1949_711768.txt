txt Most persons , we suspect , will find little in President Truman 's eight-point program for price and production controls about which to become either enthusiastic or apoplectic . For one thing , with living costs moving either sidewise or downward for some time now , the Administration 's anti-inflation crusade seems almost as synthetic today as it did in its more lurid election campaign version last autumn . For another thing , a perusal of the President 's eight points indicates that , with one exception , they consist of ( 1 ) measures already in effect , such as export control , rent control , consumer credit control and priorities for railroad transportation ; ( 2 ) measures which are largely for political consumption , such as tighter government regulation of commodity speculation , and ( 3 ) measures such as price ceilings on scarce commodities " basically affecting essential industrial production or the cost of living , " which seem almost certain to invite strong political opposition . The exception to these generalizations is a proposal dealing with the adequacy of existing plant facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as steel , of which more later . The President 's program is a repetition of the " points " he put forward in the special session of Congress last July . But these points were buttressed on that earlier occasion with two other proposals that are not to be found in the State of the Union message . They were ( 1 ) " profit control , " in the form of a revival of the wartime excess profits tax , and ( 2 ) that phantasmagoria introduced by Paul Porter , former head of the OPA , whom Mr. Truman had called in to help shape a price-control formula . It will be recalled that it was Mr. Porter 's idea to fight the war all over again on the domestic front by " rolling back " the price of any costof-living item that had risen or which " threatened to rise " 20 per cent or more above its level of June , 1946 . Much of the speculation previous to Wednesday as to what the President might propose in the way of price and production controls was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months ago such proposals were important because the country was in a mood to support the Administration in any reasonable , non-political plan for combating the forces of inflation . Today , on the other hand , with the prices of such basic costof-living items as food and clothing no longer on the rise , it is not so much a matter of what the Administration proposes , but what Congress , as it were , disposes . Congress should , and probably will , authorize an extension of the controls which , as noted above , are already in effect . As a sort of rider to one of these  --  consumer credit control  --  the President threw in , more or less casually , a proposal to " enlarge the power to control bank credit . " As it stands , that suggestion is so general as to be all but meaningless . Unless it is clarified and elaborated it is not likely to arouse any great interest . Most of the debate on the President 's program is likely to center around Point Five , his request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short supply , " and Point Seven , in which he seeks stand-by authority to impose price ceilings and " to limit unjustified wage adjustments which would force a break in an established price ceiling . " Both of these are reasonable proposals at a time when , although the worst of the post-war in flation may be behind us , production bottlenecks stfll remain , They are the more reasonable for the fact that they involve the acceptance of more or less personal responsibility by the President for putting them into effect . The most serious practical question concerning the fate of the second of these points is whether it can win the support of farm and labor Congressmen . The President 's eighth point belongs in a category of its own . This is his proposal that Congress authorize a study of the adequacy of production facilities for materials in critically short supply ; and , " if found necessary , authorize government loans for the ex-pansion of production facilities * * * and authorize the construction of such facilities directly if action by private industry fails to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nounced the removal of meat price ceilings he did so , he said , because there was no longer any " basic shortage of supplies . " Is he now trying to tell the country that there is a basic shortage in facilities for producing steel  --  and this at a time when output surpasses that with which the nation carried the production brunt in the greatest war in history ? This whole idea looks to us like one of those bad pieces of advice the President has a habit of listening to every so often . In the first place , as one steel expert points out , in eleven of the past twenty years steel production has fallen below 73 per cent of capacity , and has dropped as low as 20 per cent . It took the war and the pent-up postwar demand to bring production above the 90 per cent level . In the second place , by the time the new facilities had been completed to meet the present temporary bulge in demand , that bulge would in all probability have disappeared . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American people if he seriously believes it will quietly acquiesce in a proposal which would result in putting the Government in the steel business in peacetime , even as a " partner " of private enterprise .
