The Chief Medical Officer of the British Ministry of Health flew the ocean last week to explain to the U.S. how Great Britain , with an inadequate war supply of doctors , nurses , medicines , food , has organized its few resources so that the great mass of its citizens show " no obvious deterioration of health . " To 2,000 U.S. Public Health workers at their Atlantic City convention , Sir William Wilson Jameson explained Britain 's new system of public medical care in wartime . <P> Facts on wartime health : <P> &gt; About 400,000 hospital beds were prepared for emergencies . To everyone 's surprise , there were more empty beds than emergencies . Most of the beds are now turned over to civilian use : the Government pays the bills . Thus , said Sir Wilson , more people get care than ever before . <P> &gt; Although London has 8,000 miles of water mains , and every big main has been broken at some time or other , there has been no typhoid fever . Reason : large quantities of chlorine were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessed Sir Wilson , a good deal of paratyphoid , a milder cousin of typhoid . This was traced to unclean bakeshops . <P> &gt; There are now 300 wartime nurseries for children under five . This has made it possible to immunize thousands of babies against diphtheria . The diphtheria rate , which was formerly " shameful , " has dropped . <P> &gt; Since working hours in industry have been raised to a top limit of 65 a week for men , 60 for women , the rate of two serious diseases has soared : 1 ) tuberculosis among young women ; 2 ) industrial poisoning , mostly in munitions factories . So far , no serious dietary deficiency diseases have been observed , although Sir Wilson is sure they will turn up in the future . Although all food is scarce , only the following are rationed : meat , bacon , butter , margarine , cheese , tea , sugar , jam. * All persons must register for milk ; mothers and infants get a pint a day , schoolchildren a little more . Although this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got before the war , said Sir Wilson . His great worry , he said last week , is in the shortage of meat and cheese for workers in heavy industry and for growing children between 14 and 20 . <P> &gt; " Insanity has not increased , " stated Sir Wilson . Nor have neuroses risen . After intensive air raids , a number of people invariably suffer from severe anxiety but this usually passes after a week of good care . The suicide rate is down ; there is no increase in alcoholism , but juvenile delinquency is up , probably , said Sir Wilson , because " no one 's home is his own . " <P> The possibility of a bigger influenza epidemic than the U.S. has had in 20 years was forecast by public health doctors at a meeting in Atlantic City . Reasons : 1 ) the nation has been steadily losing the partial immunity it got from the flu scourges of World War I ; 2 ) the virus that caused mild regional epidemics last year has probably been growing in strength ; 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps . <P> <P> * Last week Secretary of Agriculture Claude Wickard said that Great Britain must have a billion dollars worth of U.S. food in the next five months .
