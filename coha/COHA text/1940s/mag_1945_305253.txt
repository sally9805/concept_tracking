Deep in Dixie-some five miles from Atlanta 's best residential section-Negro coeducational Atlanta University this week made double news . The opening of its fourth annual art exhibition ( the only U.S. show exclusively for Negroes ) was a sociological as well as an artistic phenomenon . <P> The Atlanta Annual at first ( 1942 ) got a lukewarm reception from Atlanta 's white citizens . Local newspapers paid it little or no attention . But a few of the city 's strong-minded art lovers gave it a good hand . For one , burly Editor Ralph McGill offhandedly plugged the show in his Constitution ( which believes in giving Southern Negroes at least their minimum constitutional rights ) . After several prominent whites had spoken at its opening ceremonies , the all-Negro Annual gradually became an Atlanta institution . Now one of the South 's outstanding art events , it hands out $1,400 in prizes , tries to keep its show down to a carefully chosen group , this year rejected some 50 exhibitors . <P> The new collection of 82 paintings by 48 artists proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were strongly flavored with expressionism and romanticism , but most had a primitive quality peculiarly their own . Painted in savage splashes of purple , red , black and brown , many contained writhing , weaving forms which suggested the rhythm of a voodoo ritual . Favorite subject matter : Negroes . Favorite theme : racial consciousness and antagonism . Some outstanding samples : <P> African Youth , a sleek , Congo-inspired head of a wide-eyed Negro child ( see cut ) by Sculptor William Artis , now an Army sergeant . <P> Portrait of Clair , a sensitive , Mona Lisa-like , copper-colored girl ( see cut ) , won the show 's first prize ( $300 ) for Boston Artist John Wilson . <P> Carter 's Little Filling Station , a colorful , almost odorous roadside scene ( see cut ) by Pauline Clay , was strongly reminiscent of the loamy , lopsided landscapes of Thomas Hart Benton . <P> Two Girls ( see cut ) , a lithograph by Margaret Goss of a blank-faced blond girl and a deadpan colored girl sitting side by side on a settee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past years , Negroes have done all the buying of paintings ( at one-third to one-half the price of comparable works in Manhattan galleries ) . At the Easter afternoon opening this year , Negro gallery-goers outnumbered whites by about 3-to-1 . But one prospective white purchaser nibbled .
