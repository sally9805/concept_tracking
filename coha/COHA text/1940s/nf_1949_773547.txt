The first item on the list is important in selecting a test because the reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in assessing the worth of an instrument , and because the cost must always be considered in relation to the dependability and potential utility of the test results . The use of cheap tests is seldom economical . Validity . Though inadequacy in any of the criteria presented above requires the counselor to reject the test , the most crucial item // is that of validity . A test of arithmetic problem solving in which the items demand reading performances above the level of the subjects to whom it is administered may be a valid reading test but a highly invalid test of achievement in arithmetic . A test that contains terms that are not employed by the teachers in a particular school may not be valid for the pupils in that institution . A vocabulary test that requires the student to select one of several given definitions of words may not indicate whether he can use the words properly when he writes . A test does not carry validity with it to all situations or for all persons in any situation , and the evidence of validity presented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , or is not , suitable for a local situation . If such evidence is not presented , or if it is inadequate , there is no need to consider the test further . In the use of tests for counseling we are concerned about a particular pupil 's performance in a particular area of study.Y " If a counselee is one of those students who is intent primarily on applying what he learns , he may not see the need of memorizing all the facts as they are presented . The common tests that require simple selection among factual items will not be valid for him . If we are concerned about his performance in English composition , the objective tests of English will not provide a valid measure of his competence . If our subject has missed , through absence or change in schools , some of the materials in the test , it ceases to be a valid test for him , and if he is a brilliant student who can go through the ceiling of the test , the measurement will not he valid . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary to consider all these factors and some additional ones . The evidence about the validity of an achievement test is usually presented in terms of averages of large groups , and the counselor must therefore interpret and reinterpret test scores in the light of what he knows about the particular individual with whom he is working . At the age of 16-0 , Harry had achieved an arithmetic age of 14-4 on a standardized test of arithmetic . This score meant that he was retarded one year and eight months in that subject . On the basis of such findings the following kinds of interpretations are suggested : // 1 . He has not profited at the usual rate from instruction in arithmetic , and it can be inferred , therefrom , that he will continue to proceed in that subject at a slow rate . 2 . He should be given remedial treatment . 3 . He should be guided out of further educational or vocational activities which require the use of arithmetic . 4 . He has a special disability in mathematics . 5 . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But Harry grew up in a home where his father frequently said , " I went to school for only four years and I get along all right without that stuff . " And Harry admired his father . Harry attended twelve different schools in nine years , because his father 's occupation required frequent changes of residence , and his training in mathematics was desultory . He missed large blocks of formal instruction in all school subjects . On reading tests Harry was retarded two years , although he made an average score on the StanfordBinet . In view of these facts the counselor must conclude that ticr arithmetic test , though it was highly valid for youth with normal experiences , was not valid for Harry . His , it must be pointed out , was not just a low score on a valid test . It was the product of the application of a testing procedure that was invalid for him . In the selection of an achievement test for youth who have had near normal experiences , the counselor will set up standards to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purpose . He will study the attempts of the author of the test to control vocabulary levels ; to obtain a qualitatively adequate and numerically sufficient sample of items from the age and gradr levels at which the test is to be used ; and to assure himself that enough experimentation has been done to establish these facts . If the author 's evidence of the validity of test scores lies in their correlation with scores of some other test , the counselor must examine the criterion test to see that it is satisfactory on the points noted above . If the evidence is insufficient on any of these counts , the tests must not be used . If the evidence is satisfactory he may then continue with the following criteria . Reliability . Evidence concerning the reliability of a test liar often been obscured by the use of so much esoteric verbiage and statistical formulas that many persons who use the tests fail to re ( gnize the common-sense concept of reliability . Persons who are // familiar with the need for a checker of weights and measures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar checking of a test . Individuals who repeat the measurements that they make in the activities of everyday life frequently fail to see the relationship between this process and that of demanding that a test be reliable . Teachers of science who are meticulous about the consistency with which their laboratory instruments measure from one time to the next do not always see the need for applying similar processes to the examinations which they administer to their students . Reliability coefficients do not , in themselves , tell us what we want to know about the consistency with which a test measures what it purports to measure . If we know the reliability coefficient and the distribution of scores on a test , we can compute the extent to which the test score is likely to be in error ? ? We can then study the size of the error in terms of the total range of scores and the use to which the test scores arc to be put . From study of such errors we can determine whether the test is reliable enough for our use . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a student , we shall be concerned with the size of the error in terms of grade levels . If a boy who is a candidate for placement in the ninth-grade mathematics class makes a test score at the ninth-grade level , this placement problem might be solved if the test were reliable . ( It is not assumed , of course , that any such decision would be made solely on the basis of test scores . ) If the reliability of the test is so low that the error is as large as six months , the measurement would be too crude for the purpose it was intended to serve . Where a cut-off score is used in determining acceptability for a position , as in Civil Service examinations and in situations where competition is close , it is necessary to use a test with high reliability , since a test with large errors may result in the apparent differentiation of two individuals whose potential performances are not significantly different . It could result in the selection of the least capable applicant . It should be evident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined by the purpose for which it was administered . If the counseling of an individual with respect to // some important decision is to be made , there must be a minimum of error , and therefore a high coefficient of reliability is demanded . Where group averages are concerned , larger errors of measurement may be tolerated . There is no valid argument , however , for the ? use of an unreliable instrument in dealing with either individuals or groups , and tests that result in scores with large errors should 1w eliminated from the counselor 's file . Counselors as a group should insist that all authors of tests persevere long enough in the construction of tests to assure high reliability . Norms . Norms for tests are usually given in terms of ages , grades , and percentile positions in a group or in terms of deviations from averages of certain actual or theoretical populations . The essential features of a test with good norms is that it has been administered to large groups of representative subjects at the level at which the test is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough clearly defined steps or intervals to permit an individual 's score to be interpreted meaningfully . For counseling purposes , norms should provide many reference points and measures of deviations from these points , but these points must not be interpreted as standards that all students are expected to attain . Guides to their interpretation , when a student 's score deviates from the average , should be provided . Most achievement-test manuals indicate that the norms for the test were obtained by computing the averages or percentile positions of the scores of samples of several thousand subjects . In order to get an adequate sampling , the scores of subjects of widely varying degrees of scholastic performance in subject areas and in various types of schools and communities are averaged.30 The usual central point in arithmetic test norms is therefore the product of students who are assumed to have average scholastic aptitude , average arithmetic experience , and average quality and length of instruction in the average school and average community . Norms , however , do not provide information on the extent in which each of these factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary if the student has had other than average scholastic opportunities or has enjoyed other than average experience in schools or communities . This omission is not a particularly serious problem if one is concerned with large groups where " Separate norms for public and private schools are provided for some use ( // these factors may tend to " cancel out " the influence of differential experiences . If one thinks of education as a process of getting each subject up to the same level , if there is competition for a position where knowledge of specific subject matter is essential , and if selection rather than counseling is the important task , the general norms may be adequate . But when a counselor sits down with a student , he is concerned with the score on the test and , more specifically , with the reason why the score is low or high . Tests do not provide weights to be attached to such factors as the quality of instruction , the kind of school , home , and community experiences to which a subject has been exposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student at various times in his career , " the fact that an ocular disability was not corrected until he had experienced repeated frustrations in that subject field , the quality of the textbooks used , and many other factors which may have influenced his performance on the test . If such factors as these have been negative in their influence , we may expect the score to be below ( or even , sometimes , above ) average , but the test gives us no guide as to how much variation from the average we should expect to obtain . It is possible that this low score is a high score for the student in view of the opportunities he has had . For counseling purposes we must be concerned about the difference between low scores in general and low scores of individuals . It may , for a particular individual , mean the difference between recommending remedial treatment or discouragement of further study in a particular field . Of two students who achieved the same low score on a mathematics test , one might be given special assistance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be discouraged from entering the same field because it requires so much mathematics . It is probable that when the testing movement comes of age , test manuals will provide such statements as these : " The following factors contribute to the achievement of certain scores on this test . They contribute to those scores in the given proportions . " This statement will be followed with a weighting of such variables as quality of instruction and textbooks , amount of time spent on the subjects , scores on scholastic-aptitude tests , interest or motivation , and the physical condition of the student . Until such time , how- // ever , the counselor must collect as complete data as possible upon his subjects and attempt subjective weighting of test results upon such bases . When a test score has been obtained and compared with the norms , the difficult job of interpretation has just begun , for , in addition to the factors noted above , there are problems of individual values that must be considered . A student may , for example , obtain a high score on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social adjustability ( other students call him a " grind " ) or in deprivation of opportunity for experiences in a field of greater ultimate value to him . Achievement of the high test score may have resulted in the development of undesirable attitudes toward all learning and in the setting of the habit of substituting visual memory for more functional learning . The interpretation of norms presented above has been pushed far beyond what it is reasonable to expect from authors of tests during the infancy of the test movement , and we can not expect that the data needed by counselors will soon be forthcoming . But the implication should be clear . All achievement-test scores , and especially single test scores , must be used and interpreted with great caution . They can not be used without the clarification that results from extensive additional examination of a student 's background and performances as they are revealed by intensive study with other techniques . Administration and scoring . There is no possible excuse for the distribution of tests that do not provide clear , simple , and precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assistance from teachers in administration of tests and on clerks for scoring them " and since these persons may not be trained in the use of tests and measurements , serious errors may result if instructions are not clear . Dependable test results can not be obtained unless the tester has been thoroughly schooled in actual test administration . Clerks can not be depended upon to score tests at - curately unless they are thoroughly trained and rigidly supervised and their work continuously sampled and checked for accuracy . " // Authors of most of the newer tests have considered these needs and have provided clear directions for both administration and scoring . Failure to provide such information is reason enough for rejection of an otherwise suitable test . Mechanical considerations . In general , the longer the test , the more valid it is likely to be , since the sampling of the field is likely to be more adequate . Counselors , can usually arrange periods in which they can test the whole school population simultaneously or make arrangements for teachers to administer tests during regular class time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the length of the test is not an important criterion in making the choice , but if it is not possible , it may be necessary to select tests that are so timed that they will fit into the regular school periods . Most modern tests are timed in such a way that no serious loss of validity should result in doing so . Scoring directions and techniques that require too much time ' may be reason enough for rejection of a test . Selection of a test principally because it contains one of the rapid self-scoring devices , however , can not be justified . Applicability to local conditions . Since standardized tests are designed to serve populations of large areas it is not always possible to provide a good fit to the local curriculum . Indeed , there is still clanger that the widespread use of standardized tests will tend to straight-jacket the curriculum as completely as college-entrance requirements or the state-required textbook ever did . There is always the possibility that teachers will tend to teach for the test , which becomes the local measuring rod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their students ' performance on that examination , irrespective of the differences in previous academic opportunities of the members of their classes . There is still , too , the possibility of inhibition of experimental efforts on the part of teachers whose researches require less or different coverage of the common curriculum and the discouragement , too , of those who are concerned with the achievement of objectives other than an exhibition of the information required by particular tests . When teaching practices vary from the mode , and when tests are obviously not suited to the local curriculum , the counselor should reject them . 1 f a test develops such fear of flunking that students memorize the text on which the test is based , and if it encourages the freezing of a student 's first confused impressions , it will have little use for counseling purposes other than , perhaps , providing information concern218 PERFORMANCES OF COUNSELEES ing a student 's probability of admission to another institution where similar procedures and tests are used . SIGNIFICANCE OF EDUCATIONAL LEVEL ACHIEVED BY THE INDIVIDUAL Educational level , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or importance in furthering a counselor 's appraisal of a counselee . To say that a student is in the eighth grade , has graduated from high school , or is in his second year of school is almost a meaningless statement unless supporting data are provided . Academic standing , without its history , has become increasingly less valuable in counseling as ( 1 ) promotion , graduation , and entrance standards have changed ; ( 2 ) the number of subject-field combinations in the curriculum have increased ; and ( 3 ) increased consideration has been given to outcomes of training other than for memory of text materials . It is quite possible to find students of similar achievements at various school levels , and it is not unusual to find individuals who are about to graduate from a school with lesser achievements than those who still have many years to go . Much pertinent information on this point has been presented by Learned and Hawkes84 in reports of their experiments and in the data collected by Learned and Wood 35 The comparisons that follow illustrate differences in development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : // such as chronological age , number of grades repeated or skipped , actual performance on objective tests , attitude of the individual and his parents toward education , and a health record . A record of retardation in school permits many interpretations based upon current situations , opportunities , standards , physical characteristic s , and personal attitudes , and acceleration is subject to the same possibilities of interpretation when data are added to the record . Occasionally , a statement of educational status may indicate the possibility of future academic achievement , and difficulties in interpretation of status are reduced when an institution publishes the results of the administration of tests to its students . The odds that a senior at Harvard University will make a higher score on academic tests than the average American of the same age are high . It is not absolutely certain , however , and supplementary evidence will be needed . There are occasions when educational status is an important single item , in spite of the lack of supplementary information . Certain Civil Service positions demand that an applicant must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for jobs be graduates of an approved four-year college . Professional organizations require graduation from law schools , medical schools , certified accounting courses , and others . It is illegal in such cases for a person to make untrue statements about his education , and that is reason enough for the demand that the counselor colic ( t and verify this datum . It is chiefly , then , for such legal reasons that a verified statement of educational status must be obtained rather than because it adds significantly to the understanding of a coon ? selee 's current academic achievements or the prediction of occupational accomplishments . SIGNIFICANCE OF WORK EXPERIENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL Studies reveal that the ranges of test performances of persona in any occupation are wide . " So much overlapping in measures ments obtained from members of occupational groups is found that there is no guarantee that your plumber would make lower scores on common mental tests than your doctor or lawyer , al- // though the probability in general is that he will do so . " Your dentist may have been well below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual skills , whereas your lawyer may have been superior in such processes to more than half of the members of the professional school attended by your dentist.38 Membership in an occupational group does not ( except within wide limits ) denote certainty of accomplishments as much as it indicates the chance influences operating at the time that the vocational choice was made . Many influences , such as the following , may have determined unsatisfactory choices of a vocation : 1 . Limited information about the occupation . ( Many students say that they want to become naval architects or medical technologists without any appreciation of the training required for such occupations. ) 2 . Glamour . Doctor and motion-picture actor have high prestige value . 3 . Mystery . Electrical engineering has mysterious connotations for adolescents . 4 . Admiration . Teachers may be appreciated and students desire to be like them . 5 . Proximity . Father is a lawyer . 6 . Ambition . Governor or president or statesman arc considered to be high attainments. 7 . Suggestion . Friends , relatives , or advertisements of street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Morbid analysis of oneself . 9 . Fear of failure . 10 . Underestimation of one 's " abilities . " 11 . Conceit or overestimation of one 's level of performances in specific areas . 12 . Belief in wrong methods of succeeding in an occupation as given by various books and advertisements . // 13 . Pressure of economic conditions or family financial situation . 14 . Bad advice from misinformed persons . Our occupational society is , however , stratified . Doctors and dentists are at socially different levels , and both are usually at different strata than the bricklayer or the blacksmith , irrespective of their incomes . " Teachers have a peculiar status as servants and , at the same time , as leaders . Farmers are separated from city dwellers despite the fact that many factors have operated recently to raisr the socioeconomic status of farmers . Racial groups are separated from others even when they work in the same institution . It is traditional modes of social classification , the prestige of education , and the accumulation of wealth , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than their skills or performances . Nothing more than the fact that they have met the legal requirements for education may have distinguished your CPA from your bookkeeper or your teacher from your milkman , before they received special training . When the occupation of a counselor or his parents is noted in a case history , there can not be automatically , then , an interpretation beyond the meeting of legal ( a license to practice medicine , for example ) qualifications . A listing of the occupation of a client or his parents may provide leads to the Cin ? selor in terms of legal status , extent of education , and social stand ? ing , but these are only leads . They may or may not indicate particular skills and superior or inferior accomplishments . The counselor must begin with probabilities , but he will not stop with them . Ile will go beyond the probable condition to the particular case . Influence of work experience . Work experience may have in. fluenced an individual in three important ways : ( 1 ) It may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish ? ments. ( 2 ) He may have learned certain facts about the demand of certain occupations and the problems of adjustment that he wig meet in them . ( 3 ) It may have given him some insight into tit world of everyday work and the problems and opportunities in certain occupations . A high-school boy who has had work experience is more likely than those who have not to be aware of the nerd // for making a wise choice of a career , and the evidence is clear that the boy who has worked while he attended school is more likely to find a job when there are many persons unemployed . ' The boy who has seen his father 's occupation at first hand by working with him may , or may not , be sufficiently informed about it to know whether he wants to choose it for his career . The leads offered by work experience and occupation are worth following by the counselor , but they do not offer adequate evidence upon which a final decision can be made because sampling of the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most youth , the time sample too short . Good vocational choices probably depend on more than work experience . The following items should be considered : 1 . Experience in doing sample tasks similar to those required in occupations . ( Care must be taken , however , to see that he has received more than a small sample of work under artificial situations. ) 2 . Information about occupations through broad curricular experiences , classes in occupations , reading , and observation . 3 . Study of the relation of one 's own past performances ( through various forms of measurement and description ) to occupational needs . Part-time employment . The value of part-time employment as a tryout experience is frequently overestimated by counselors . Few of the real problems associated with full time occupational careers an be appreciated by the youth who holds a part-time job : the . ossible monotony of years of work , the problems of making his age provide for all his needs , the frequently impersonal situations f the factory as compared to those in the school , the problems raised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the job may imply complete loss of a means of livelihood , the appreciation of the fact that he is at the bottom of the occupational ladder , and the realization of what is needed to move up in the promotion scheme . All these factors may not be given enough consideration by the boy on a part-time job . The lad who works In the grocery store after school and on Saturday frequently escapes h // the effects of a full work week . He usually knows that his parents will supplement his income and provide subsistance if he loses his current job and generally realizes that his work status is temporary , These differences between full and part-time work can be so great that occasional jobs may fail to provide adequate tryouts for the real thing . At their worst they may actually provide misleading information and develop unsound attitudes . At their best they can provide only a partial picture of the world of work . The counselor will not , therefore , assume that the lad who insists upon choosing an occupation upon the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the job is not too demanding of time from school and recreational opportunities , and where the family financial condition permits it , work experience in several occupations is usually desirable . And it may assist the youth to liar ? row down the range of choices among vocations . The experience must always , however , be supplemented by considerable reading and instruction concerning the vocation that is being considered as a life career . Occupations require more from the individual than skills . 7'h job wisdom and social understandings that are part of an occupation may be completely missed in any period of part-time work . 1'h boy who has worked at the lower levels of any trade or business . since he must start at the beginning tasks , may not have been in ducted into many of the important aspects of the job at high levels . The new chore boy is seldom given the dangerous or nu complex assignments , and since he has not usually had the opportunity to learn what is required for safety and success at the high levels , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time basis that the higher requirements of the full-time et ployee are beyond his capacity . The more complete social uncle standings of the job , which require intelligent behavior and stud of circumstances with respect to such social factors as labor-management relationships , may be quite beyond the ken of the boy w escaped their influence as a minor employee . The carriers of newspapers can not be expected to learn enough from their duties know the newspaper business , nor can the Saturday clerk get more than a slight inkling of what is involved in retail merchandisin Nothing that has been said about part-time employment is i tended to suggest that it is an undesirable experience . The gro ing program of work experience for school credit should , if ca // fully worked out and guarded against misuse by employers and students , provide excellent data for the counselor and useful training for the youth . All that has been said above is intended to indicate that great care must be taken in the interpretation of its effect upon the person . Skills , information , and attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where they influence the behavior of the individual in any given manner . If they have been developed or acquired , their influence may or may not be important in determining next steps in the counseling process . The extent to which these skills , information , and attitudes will be weighed in taking these steps depends upon their relationships to data collected by other means and from other sources . They will usually supplement rather than direct the process . Prediction of success . Prediction of success in any occupation is very difficult . In the process of constructing tests to do so , it has become common practice to measure the characteristics of members of occupational groups , and then measure trainees in , or applicants for , positions in such groups , to determine the extent to which they exhibit similar characteristics . This technique neglects the possibility that the members of an occupation may have acquired the characteristics that distinguish them from persons in general during their period of training for it and even during the period in which they have worked at the occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be assumed ? that the trained member of an occupation is the same individual who , some years before , began training for that job . Nor is the present applicant certain to retain the characteristics that he now exhibits over the training and initial working periods . The counselor must , then , obtain some information on the influence of training for , and practice in , an occupation before he can rely on tests to provide valid pretraining evidence of occupational fitness . He must be very cautious about the use of scores obtained from such inventories as the Strong Vocational Interest Blank and similar devices which are based upon data obtained from graduates of training programs or from practitioners in any field.47 Longitudinal studies of the characteristics of individuals before , during , and after occupational training periods are essential , but not enough of these have been completed to assure the counselor that a person 's characteristics will remain con- // stant enough to warrant a high degree of optimism about success in forecasting later occupational performances . SUMMARY In this chapter an attempt has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called " mental abilities " and the many controversies about inherent aptitudes , partly because they are rather fully recounted in many other books , and partly because it seems futile for counselors to join in such controversies until more research results are available . There does appear to 1w a current swing away from the general mental test but the counselor who plans to follow the trend must be disappointed with the instruments which have been designed to replace them . " In view of this unfortunate situation and in the light of the questions raised by those who have considered the semantics involved in test interpretation , it is suggested that the counselor will depend largely on carefully selected achievement tests , and that when he uses tests that have other labels , he must not forget that he is still measuring achievement . If he makes inferences from the scores derived from such tests , he must always remember that they are inferences that need substantiation by evidence obtained from many sources . He will find that his test scores answer few questions completely and solve few problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion as he must reject the personality tests . The leads , hints , suggestions , and cues obtained from achievement-test scores are mete h more likely to be fruitful than those from personality questionnaires and interest inventories . It has been suggested in this chapter that the counselor must // use teachers ' marks in the counseling process despite the fact that they are frequently unreliable and invalid . Their value will be increased if the counselor knows the conditions under which they have been assigned , if he has helped the teachers to make analyses of student performances , and if he has encouraged them to make supplementary comments about pupils ' behavior . It has been suggested that teachers ' marks supplemented by a battery of achievement tests and ( occasionally ) tests of special skills will provide the basic data for estimating the probable later achievements of students when such data are combined with the information obtained with techniques described in other chapters of this volume . It has been suggested that the counselor may find the so-called " tests of mental maturity " of limited value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of mass administration of " I.Q. tests " in the secondary school is no longer justified . It has been demonstrated that statements of academic level and occupational experience provide limited evidence concerning counselees ' current accomplishments or probable performances , and it has been suggested that their effect upon particular subjects must be analyzed . Throughout the chapter the fact that tests have not yet been developed to the point where scores indicate automatically the fitness of an individual for any particular educational opportunity or occupational experience has been stressed . // // Adapted from Tests Used in the Eight-Year Study of the Progressing Education Association Read the following paragraph and then answer the thirteen questions that follow . Do not discuss them until you have finished . Work quickly . A Statement on Work Experience The following statement is condensed from an advertisement which appeared in a large metropolitan newspaper : " After six to eight years of schooling , supplemented by church and home training , the average American boy begins to form some ideas about his future and arrives at the time in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without such practical work experience , the learning he secures in school is likely to be superficial and useless .

The newspapers of America are furnishing this kind of experience to thousands of boys . " A group of students , after discussing this statement , decided that as a result of their experiences , newsboys will be more responsible , productive , and thrifty citizens than boys without such experiences . Statements : Use A if you are inclined to accept the statements , // B if you are uncertain about them , and C if you are inclined to reject them . 1 . If job experience is to make school learning mean more to a boy , it must involve regular responsibilities , personal advantages , and an opportunity to see business at first hand . 2 . Even though a person is well educated , he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy graduates from elementary school , he begins to think about his future and form some ideas of his own . 4 .

When a boy starts to think for himself , some practical job experience will help make his school learning mean more to him . 7 . There are many stories about boys who sold papers and later became very successful businessmen . 8 . Employment in an established business concern will provide a boy with valuable experience which he could not receive in the school , the church , or the home . 9 . Boys should have more educational experiences in some other type of work than in selling newspapers . 10 .

Publishers of newspapers are against child-labor legislation . 12 . Well-educated people are usually more responsible and more thrifty than poorly educated people . 13 . The experiences of newsboys encourage irresponsibility which often leads to delinquency and crime in later life . After the questions have been answered , the class may be divided into small groups and each item discussed . Particular attention should be paid to the language used , and the implications contained in each statement . Note , for example , that question 3 implies that a boy does not begin " to think about his future and form some ideas of his own " until he graduates from elementary school . // Following the discussion period , students may check the statements a second time and note the changes which have resulted from the discussion . // Indicate your response to the newspaper article cited below by writing a letter to its author .

Psychologists and their converts swear by it . It has been used on school children , soldiers , industrial workers , criminals and other people who ca n't defend themselves from the onslaught of the faddists , and its proponents have neatly classified thousands of human beings as " brilliant , " " normal " or " below par " and have slept soundly in the serene belief that the last word had been said . But the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A. S. Smith , superintendent of schools in Rocktown , points to an experience in a certain high school recently . An " I.Q. " test was given there not long ago . One boy got a high mark of 145 , which meant that he was very brilliant . Another got a low of 70 , which means that he was right down on the edge of feeble ? mindedness . Then the pupils were given an examination in geometry . The exceptionally brilliant pupil and the utter dumbbell both got the same mark ? 75 , a passing grade . Nor is that all . Two students whose " I.Q. " ratings were less than 100 ? and any psychologist will tell you that means they are n't over-bright  --  got grades of 90 in the examination . None of the four highest " I.Q. " pupils got a better grade than 80 ; one of them wound up with a 65 . The two lowest grades given in the examination were received by pupils with intelligence ratings of 105 and 107 , respectively . The // average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I.Q. " ratings ? was 82 ; the average for the 10 brightest , based on the same ratings , was 76 . All of this seems to indicate pretty conclusively that the " I.Q. " test does n't even come close to being as accurate a gauge of a person 's intelligence as it is supposed to . And perhaps it is about time that we stopped paying very much attention to it . // Criticize the following report of a teacher with respect to its value for counseling . figure // " hired help " whom he enjoyed " managing . " By the time Eric reached the age of twelve , he had not chosen to learn to read . He had taken only as much schoolwork as he had wanted to , and he had adjusted to only such rules as he considered acceptable . When he came to a psychoeducational clinic for examination , he considered the psychometrist to be another maid , and he used his favorite annoying device of plastering chewing gum in her hair . After several months of intensive individual treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was not achieved until all the resources of clinic personnel had been utilized , considerable retraining of parents had been accomplished , and the cooperation of teachers who had previously considered him hopeless had been obtained . But Eric came from what was described as an excellent home in a fine part of the city . The socioeconomic status was superior , the psychological condition atrocious . Though Eric 's case may seem somewhat extreme , it indicates the validity of the general statement that adequacy of a home can not be measured on any scale of socioeconomic status yet devised . Information concerning the size of a home , its geographic location , and the quality of the plumbing must be supplemented by information about the attitudes and atmosphere that are maintained within it . The extent to which attitudes developed in " good " homes may create difficult problems in counseling is illustrated further in the case of Dick . The senior author , acting as a tutor for Dick during the summer , was attempting to get him ready for the next year in a private secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dick arranged , both tutor and student were swinging golf clubs in an idle manner until Dick suddenly decided that he wanted to take some real practice strokes . He secured a half-dozen new golf balls , set them up on tees , and proceeded to hit each one with well-tutored strokes into the neighboring woods . When the tutor indicated that the balls should be retrieved , Dick rejected the suggestion with the statement that , " They 're too hard to find and there 's lots more where they come from . My old man 's got plenty of them . " The attitude revealed by this incident was rather typical of his feelings toward everything of a material nature . There was plenty of everything for him , and he was unconcerned about the amount of it that was wasted . Dick 's attitude was developed in what was usually described as " a fine home . " If this attitude from " a fine home " is contrasted with those of // Philip Bronson whose complete case record is presented in Chapter II , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental attitudes toward a youth can be deduced from surface description of his home . He will decide that it is necessary to look for attitudes directly rather than to assume their absence or presence upon the basis of information supplied by general statements about social backgrounds in terms of their plumbing and paint . Home description . A measuring scale that encourages , and makes provision for , the description of a home in terms of factors other than material possessions was developed ( in part by the senior author ) to meet the demands of the director of an investigation into the reasons for pupil failures in many elementary schools in Massachusetts . It is presented in full below to indicate some of the items of information about a home which these investigators believed essential in order to obtain sufficient information about their pupils . Many of the items of the scale are similar to those used in the older socioeconomic scales , ' but many of them demand more attention to analyses of the attitudes and atmosphere of the home than the older scales required . Consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thinking of those who arranged the items . In addition to the usual single statement about parental income , the reader will note that a question is to be asked about whether that income is " steady . " The reason for the inclusion of the additional question becomes clear when it is revealed that the income of many workers is obtained in one lump sum at the time that a single cash crop is sold . In some areas it is common practice to go on a spending spree , to live in luxury for a short period of time , and to live at minimum or lower subsistence levels for the remaining months of the year . It is possible , therefore , to get a response to the question about income that seems to indicate that sufficient compensation for adequate maintenance of a home at a fairly high standard has been received . A simple statement about total annual income , without further questioning , may fail to reveal that the " sufficient " income is spread over two months of luxury and ten of deprivation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of socioeconomic status may fail to appreciate that fact . // Parental attitudes . Counselors must not be misled by statements of parents concerning their interest in children or even by their public activities in child-welfare movements . The fact that a boy 's mother is president of the local parent-teacher association is not valid evidence that she is interested in the welfare of parents , teachers , children , or schools . It may simply provide for her a social occasion , an opportunity to acquire social recognition , an escape from an undesirable home situation , or a steppingstone to further social or political office . It is not implied that most , or even many , parent-teacher association workers are so disposed , but the condition is common enough in community organizations that the counselor must not be misled by titles , memberships , or a bustle of seeming socially constructive activity . The counselor will go beyond them to see whether the expressed interest is genuine and well informed , and whether the public utterances reflect any degree of good home care for the particular youth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonition that he must become aware of the parents goals for his son , as well as those of the son , will soon be tempted to divide parents into two groups . The members of the first group will be those who seem to argue that their sons should do what they did because , they imply , " We went through it and see what a success it made of us.j2 The second group will consist of those parents who say , or imply , " We missed that experience and we have been sorry about it ever since . No child of ours is going to miss it and meet the difficulties we have had . " No such clear-cut classification of parents is , of course , possible , for there are others who do not give any indication that they care what their children do , still others who subscribe to the " Let them make their own bed " theory , and others who hold various combinations of such beliefs . In most cases , however , the counselor will find that parents have rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be done about them . ' He will find that many adaptations are required to suit the circumstances . Parents continue to confuse such occupations as electrician and electrical engineer in terms of the amount of training required , performances needed , and job opportunities . When this confusion occurs , it is usually necessary to begin the slow process of teaching the // parents about both the boy and the job , and it may require several years of concentrated effort to change their ambitions to have the boy graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to that of earning a diploma at the local trade school , or vice versa . Such steps are not likely to be taken as the results of one interview , nor is the acquisition of knowledge about the difference in requirements of membership in a symphony orchestra and dance band an easy task for many parents . Such changes may require intensive work with the student , his parents , and his teachers , and use of information collected over a full school career . Many teachers who have been taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pupils live can provide valuable information about them to the counselor . The following description of the conditions under which an adolescent girl lived was provided by a teacher of home economics to a counselor when he began to work with the girl . The reader may not agree that all of the background information given by this teacher was essential , but there can be little doubt that she has indicated some of the major problems in this case , and has expressed a willingness to help in their solution . The counselor can not afford to neglect such assistance . BONNY A Report by a Teacher of Home Economics in a Junior High School In order to understand the following case study properly , it seems necessary to present first , the unusual family background of the child involved , since it has played such a vital part in creating the existing problem . It also seems worthy to note how the many agencies and services of a public school system may be integrated to guard and protect the welfare of every public school child and the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought up on a farm by people at whose hands she suffered extreme cruelty . She was made to do very hard work , which lowered her resistance and caused tuberculosis . Hoping to escape her unhappy surroundings , she married , while very young , a man who treated her worse than she had been treated at home . He left her with two children to support and without resources . She managed to get along by doing many kinds of hard work until the two children were nearly grown up . At this time she was weakened by tuberculosis and , feeling herself no longer able // to go out and do the type of work she had been doing , she obtained a position as a housekeeper for a family in a neighboring town . The family permitted her to keep only the younger child ( Bonny ) with her and she appealed to the State to take custody of the older child . In this new home , Bonny 's mother met with the first real kindness she had ever known . A son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of his knowledge of her background and made a pleasant home for the entire family near this city . During this time Bonny 's mother was growing steadily worse , , and the expense of her medical treatment caused the family to lose their home and move to this city where they were residing when this study took place . Bonny and her sister entered school , but in a short time the older one , then fifteen , asked for a permit to leave school since her mother 's increasing illness demanded full-time care . This request was investigated by the supervisor of attendance and the school nurse . It was found that the mother and the older sister were suffering from tuberculosis . Both mother and daughter were placed in a sanatorium . When the mother was committed to the hospital , the state supervisor investigated the case . There was a question as to whether it would be advisable to allow Bonny to continue to live alone with a man who was not her own father . Finding him to be a man of the utmost integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might be allowed to keep a home , it was decided to let Bonny remain with him for the present . Bonny first attracted attention as needing special guidance and study because of the sudden change in behavior in the ninth grade from that which she had exhibited in the eighth . From a girl who was most interested in the study of home-making and who did very good work , she became uncontrollable . She seemed far more interested in how she looked and in entertaining her classmates than in the work which formerly interested her so much . I wondered if anything could be done to prevent Bonny from developing in this undesirable way . She was not an academic problem and her work was still good . Since , however , character training is a major objective of junior high school education , and the major objective of home economics education , I felt that both she and I were failing in this respect . The counselors found that Bonny 's I.Q. score is 100 . Her health is good but she stutters slightly and lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormally interested in romance for a girl of her age . She reads such magazines as True Story , True Confessions , and Love Stories . She is in constant association with boys . She dreams of her ambition to become an airplane hostess , and she // states quite frankly that she hopes it will culminate in marriage with someone met en route . At present Bonny is living alone with her stepfather whose work demands that he leave before she gets home from school , and he does not return until 1:30 or 2:00 A.M. This leaves Bonny entirely on her own when school closes at 3:30 to follow any pursuits she may desire . Her father is kind to her and gives her money to spend , but I am sure he does not know of her association with boys until late at night . He would be most cooperative if informed of the grave danger of her present situation , but his absence from home gives him little opportunity to exert the necessary parental influence in this case . The visitor from the State Department will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is remedied but , while she is with us , have n't we a moral and social obligation to help this girl all we can now ? She loves sports but never goes out for them since she feels that her teachers have a poor opinion of her and dislike her generally , and that she would get unsatisfactory marks and not be allowed to play on teams anyway . Ca n't we somehow develop her interest in more wholesome leisure activities , encourage her to go out for sports , direct her reading tastes toward something she will enjoy and , at the same time , be worthwhile ? Someone must help fill the tremendous gap in this young girl 's life . To be sure you may argue that there may be many others with equally bad home conditions that we do n't know of , but we do know about this girl and can not ignore her real need of our help . HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL The counselor must have evidence about the health of his counselees when he is making an appraisal of their current behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the past , and when he is trying to ensure that adequate consideration will be given to health in his subject 's plans for the future . Despite the fact that the value of health records is generally conceded to be great , there is evidence that too few of them are obtained and that too little use is made of those which are available . ' A rather typical situation is reported by a counselor who found on health cards , which were kept apart from other cumulative records , that a notation of suspected tuberculosis had been entered on the health record of a high-school girl for three successive years without any evidence of action upon the entry . Until severe illness or very unusual and obvious evidence of inadequate development appears , it is frequently very common practice to ignore the health record . // Counselors not health specialists . Counselors are not well enough informed about health problems to question the entries on a medical report . They must accept what is reported by the medic .. ) specialist just as they will expect physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . They can encourage the subject to seek the best possible advice when a health problem arises , and if local practitioners can not provide it , they can work with them in arranging referral to authorities at large medical centers and providing lay descriptions of symptoms which have appeared in school situations . When they find , for example , that a stubborn case of reading difficulty persists , despite the fact that common tests show that each eye singly meets minimum vision standards , they can refer the subject for a test of the way in which his eyes function together , as they must in reading . ' At the same time they may find it necessary to obtain advice about the presence of rare ocular deviations which local devices have not disclosed . Under certain circumstances a counselor may be required to work with subjects whose problems seem to derive from unsatisfactory health conditions despite the fact that medical authorities have made negative reports . On one occasion , for example , a counselor was called upon to assist in the treatment of a boy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extremely listless in all school activities , and who seemed to be undervitalized . After some study of the boy 's behavior , the counselor suggested to Iris mother that the boy should be examined by the family physician . A negative report was received , and there appeared to be no physical cause of his listless behavior . He was labeled a " lazy " boy by his teachers , and their efforts to stimulate him were futile . Evidence contained in reports submitted by teachers , however , indicated that something must be wrong and that some action must be taken . Interviews revealed that he was a carrier boy on two paper routes . The first of these two lucrative jobs began at halfpast five in the morning and the second at half-past four in the afternoon . His parents did not need the money that he earned , but they had encouraged him to do the work because they thought that it provided good training , and they praised him for his industry . They had been firmly convinced for some time that his // diligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become concerned about his lack of success at school . Investigations by the counselor revealed that the boy had expanded his mutes so effectively that there was no time for breakfast between five-thirty and the time that school opened in the morning and that after school was dismissed , he did not have time for the usual play activities . He was tired and very hungry in the morning , and appeared to be thoroughly exhausted at night , but the medical examination had not disclosed these conditions because his mother had permitted him to sleep late on the day on which he was taken to the physician . When the counselor 's analysis of the situation was presented to the parents , they readily approved the recommendations that the evening paper routes be discontinued , and that the boy be provided with a nourishing mid-morning lunch . Under these circumstances the listless behavior soon disappeared , and the label " lazy " was soon dropped . The counselor had made a contribution to the welfare of a student after the problem had been originally presented as a matter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must learn that health and physical conditions may be so variable in their effects that specific kinds of behavior can rarely be predicted upon the evidence presented in a health report . Students respond to visual difficulties , for example , in a manner consistent with their prevailing modes of adjustment , and visual conditions can not be considered apart from the individual 's motivational structure . The differential effects of visual handicaps are illustrated in the cases of two college students described by Bender , Imus , and Rothney in t he following statement : G Both students had visual defects . Each wore a correction which brought his eyes very near to normal . Both were within the upper third of their class in scholastic average . Dillon majored in English with its extensive reading requirements , studying even beyond his immediate assignments in both literature and philosophy . Cutler , majoring in chemistry-zoology , had fewer reading assignments , but had much laboratory work ; he did not go beyond his assignments . Dillon participated in many extra-curricular activities , Cutler in practically none . From intensive studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their value and energies . Springing from the nature of Dillon 's personality pattern a tremendous drive // developed which was determined to express itself in creative writing and criticism ? work of high quality . Dillon strove for facility of expression , and energy was released chiefly to achieve such a value . Ilia visual defects , like others , were obstacles to be overcome in the attainment of his purposes . From Cutler 's peculiar personality pattern , on the other hand , there emerged a happy-go-lucky facade with a fatalistic acceptance of his feelings of helplessness underneath ; and these feelings exacted a toll of much energy . He was confused about his values ; he yearned to be intellectual but constantly feared failure . " If I had perfect eyesight , " he wrote , " my scholastic record would have been no different . " In his case , the correction of his visual defects could not be expected to make any difference in his purposes . It appears that visual factors , even those of extreme degree , do not necessarily cause maladjustment . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alibis for failures , and induce other modes of behavior , depending upon the characteristics of the individual . It is this kind of observation that leads Allport to write : We often hear extravagant claims for the importance of posture , speech , diet , hearing , teeth , tonsils , allergy or somato-type in the shaping of personality . The personal document can have the merit of keeping the specialist from riding his hobby too hard and of showing how physical factors are , in the last analysis , embedded in the total life of the subject . The counselor should remember these statements when he is examining the health record of an individual . Like all other records , they need interpretation and supplementation . Use of screening devices . There has grown up in public schools and colleges , particularly as a result of the emphasis upon remedial reading , a tendency to take over some functions that properly be . long to health departments . The practice of " screening " for physical defects , particularly of hearing and vision , has grown to alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests seems t be that until some practicable means can be found for the examination of every child by a qualified eye specialist , it will be necessary to utilize some procedure in the schools to screen out those who need particular attention . Although one may be in sympathy with this impatience and unwillingness to await development of ideal conditions , it does seem necessary to bear in mind that attempts to // " screen " cases may result in selecting too many students for specialist 's examination ( so many , indeed , that it seems that all cases should have been sent to specialists without the intermediate screening step ) , and allowing many of those who need special assistance to be overlooked . The careful study of the vision-screening device , commonly known as the " telebinocular , ' by Oak and Sloane ( in which the senior author participated ) led them to the following conclusions : 8 The study points to the fact that the telebinocular tests sort out too many children for practical purposes and also that they miss children who need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the study , " Does the vision testing material , as it is dispensed to and used by schools , serve to screen out the children who should be referred to an eye specialist ? " is answered in the negative . The counselor who insists upon the use of the best obtainable instruments will look at all health-screening devices with suspicion . In any case , where a health condition or physical defect appears to he significant , he will demand more information about it than current screening devices provide . Health problems met by the counselor . Rothney and Roens ' have described the problems in health that counselors frequently meet in public-school situations . They selected ten students , only . ne of which was chosen because she represented a particular type of health condition , and described the problems with which they had to deal in counseling these individuals . One of the ten had no ? rganic disorders , according to the report of an examining physiian , but his posture was so bad that he appeared to be suffering rom a physical disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of his body build , and another had defective vision in one eye and almost failed to graduate ith his class because he contracted pneumonia during his senior . 1 // year . One boy had stomach disorders , and the counselor was rr ? quired to arrange for treatment at reduced cost in a special clinic after his mother 's home remedies had not proved effective . The health and appearance of one girl improved after a parttime job was obtained where the employer demanded that she rat two good meals a day , and after a suitor with whom she had frequent " dates " was drafted , so that she no longer stayed up late . A second girl developed such a severe case of rheumatism in her legs and neuritis in her arms that she missed thirty-one days of school during her senior year . One girl refused to wear her glasses because she thought they detracted from her appearance , and another suffered from an incurable state of underdevelopment of one limb resulting from an attack of infantile paralysis . During her senior year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had made for postschool education , and another girl found , almost too late , that her visual condition precluded her entrance into the vocation which she had chosen . The health problems noted above are samples of those which the counselor meets in public schools . They raise such questions as these : Should students who have missed large segments of schoolwork in their senior year be permitted to graduate with their classes , and what effect will a delay have on postschool plans which they have worked out with the counselor ? What can be done to encourage a high-school girl to wear the glasses that her physician says she needs ? How can a youth with a permanent impairment be stimulated to work up to , but not beyond , the limits imposed by it ? And how can the tendency to do too much for him out of sympathy for his condition be avoided ? How much wor or other activity can this student safely carry in view of his physic . condition , and in what respects does a health impairment limit th . choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific actions of the coun selor , always with the advice of a physician , can be recommended In most circumstances the solutions to the problems can be reache. only when careful consideration is given to many factors within th individual and among the situations that the individual meets . Th following extracts from the reports of counselors who have worke. with such problems illustrate some of the procedures.30 // Treatment of Elson 's health problem required recognition by the counselor of the inadequacy of home treatments , and the making of arrangements for professional treatment at reduced cost . Without such arrangements there could be no effective counseling for this boy . Beaten down by lack of reward for his efforts in school and neglected and abused at home , his morale was reduced to a very low ebb when physical pain was added to the complex . No specialist in health , the counselor was confronted with a health problem which limited the effectiveness of his procedures , and it was necessary to arrange for medical treatment to remove the limitations . Mollie persisted in her decision to discard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her appearance , regardless of advice from parents , counselor , and oculist . Since her visual condition was not a vital matter it seemed best to drop the issue in the hope that she would realize the importance of taking care of her vision after she had found her man . Mary 's counseling required the careful balancing of activities so that she could carry on fully up to , but not beyond , the limits imposed by her physical condition . These authors indicate that similar health problems required vastly different forms of treatment , depending upon the attitudes that each subject had previously developed toward his condition , the physicians ' statements about the possibility of correcting it , the amount of cooperation obtained from parents and school personnel , and the subject 's interests , ambitions , and previous performances . Health records for counseling . Probably the greatest need of the counselor in his work with subjects who have health problems is the statement by a competent medical authority concerning the limits within which the students ' educational and vocational plans arc practicable . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matters , but , as medical specialists increase their knowledge about the vocational implications of their findings , they may improve their contributions to counseling by reporting them in terms of indications and contra-indications so that counselors will know what an individual may safely undertake . The information may then be used , not merely to keep a youth from work or training situations in which he is likely to fail , but to direct him toward those in which there is greatest chance of success . // It seems likely that the school health record of the future will be more helpful to the counselor than those which are currently in use . The Statewide Committee on School Health Services and the School Health Committee of the Wisconsin State Medical Society " suggests , for example , that the physician keep the record which has commonly been placed in the school file ( and which no one but a nurse or physician is likely to understand ) , and send on to the teacher or counselor only those recommendations which stem from it . Instead , then , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialists ' answers to such questions as these : figure Do you recommend curtailment of extra-curricular activities ? Yes ? No Should work at home be restricted ? Yes No Should a work permit be issued for pupil , if requested ? Yes . No Specific remarks concerning the need for specific dental , psychiatric , medical , or surgical care are also recorded by the physician , and school personnel are asked to be specific in their coin ? ments about the checks to be made upon such matters . // If school records of this kind are maintained , and if , as information is added concerning the health requirements of certain occupations , it can be incorporated into the records which a counselor needs , health data can be used much more effectively than it commonly is in public educational institutions . In the meantime the counselor must work for the improvement of school records , avoid automatic behavior interpretations of health conditions , spurn the use of screening devices , cooperate in the collection of evidence about health conditions , assist in the processes of referral of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that the recommendations of specialists are carried out . SIGNIFICANCE OF SEX AND AGE DIFFERENCES Sex . The extent and significance of sex differences are currently much less common subjects of research than they were during the first decades of educational and psychological experimentation , but the counselor must not conclude that they are of less importance . The counselor must be constantly aware of the special problems of differences between the sexes12 with respect to physical development , cultural requirements , and , particularly , ultimate vocational objectives . He will , however , note that the generalizations that apply to sex groups in general do not necessarily apply to the particular individual with whom he is working . For some time the senior author has obtained the response of college juniors enrolled in the first course in a teacher-training program to two questions . The first one is stated as follows : " If things go just as would like them , what would you like to be doing five years from today ? " The second question is the same as the first , except that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the first question . Tabulation of the responses of some 300 juniors to these questions is presented below to indicate the difference between sex groups . Study of the figures on the following page indicate that only 21 and 6 per cent , respectively , of the women want to remain as teachers five and ten years beyond their junior year in college , while 73 and 74 per cent , of the men want to continue in the profession for those periods . Among the women , 59 per cent want to be mar- " Lincoln , E. A. , Sex Differences in the Growth of Public School Children . ( New York : The Macmillan Company , 1938 ) ; Shuttleworth , F. K. , Sexual Maturation and the Physical Growth of Girls ( Washington , D.C. , 1937 ) . Society for Research in Child Development . // ried within a five-year period , and 80 per cent have the same goal within ten years . The women expect that marriage will end their professional careers . Such differences as these raise important issued in counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program of graduate study are raised by young women who are contents plating marriage , and queries about relative merits of curricula choices must be considered with those who state that they want minimum of professional courses ( " Since I 'm going to teach only two years " ) and more general education . The counselor will fin. also that he must consider similar attitudes in placement of young . women . The opportunity to meet eligible men may outweigh man other considerations when a young woman is choosing among can employment opportunities . Consider , for example , the following repo on Mary presented by Rothney and Roens : Five years after Mary had graduated from the secretarial school and eleven years after the first counseling , the counselor intervicwed her and obtained the following information . Mary admitted that she had experienced some doubts about he choice of training for secretarial work while she was engaged in i but had finally decided that it was a good choice . When pressed fi // the reason why she thought so she said , " My aim in life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could find the right man . " She felt that college training would have delayed and perhaps prevented the social activities which she considered to be necessary in the preparation for marriage . After completion of the secretarial course she was offered several positions , and , in order to make a good choice , she listed five in order of desirability , interviewed the five employers , discussed the pros and ins with her parents and a new high school counselor , and finally accepted a position as secretary to a professor of law . Her choice of this position was influenced in part by the opportunity it provided to meet a number of eligible young men . She worked at that position for three years , liked it very much , and was rated as an excellent secretary by her employer . During the war years Mary was an active volunteer worker in soldiers ' canteens . At one of these she met a soldier to whom she as married with full approval of her parents , after an engagement of one year . She resigned from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small business in a suburb of Boston . She s now ( in 1947 ) the mother of one child and considers herself to ? c very fortunate to have " a wonderful husband and baby . " 14 Differences in local and general cultural requirements for the Ilexes may be observed in many situations despite the frequentlynoted reduction of restrictions for women , and the increase in number of activities which are common to both groups . Regulation of omen by prescription of hours of freedom in the college dormitory and of acceptable behavior in social situations , for example , emphasizes that the fact that the counselor of young women must meet problems that differ in amount and complexity from those that are met by the counselor of young men . In view of such differences it is probably desirable that counselee and counselor should . of the same sex . If counselors are well trained and if they are ighly skilled , they may work with members of the other sex at the junior and senior high school levels , but the closer the counselor 's xperience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood there // is that he will interpret the information about him in an effective manner . The counselor of either sex must , however , be aware of the dangers involved in the acceptance of common generalizations about sex differences . Studies of such inaccurately measured characteristics as emotional responsiveness , neuroticism , dependence , and the whole gamut of personality characteristics do not yet show , beyond any reasonable doubt , that each young woman possesses more of these characteristics than many young men . " Even where sex differences seem to have been well established , as , for example , in manipulative skills , the counselor may find that a particular subject varies significantly from the usual pattern . Indeed , he may find it completely reversed . In the literature of sex differences there has been much straining in attempts to draw out implications of the findings of the observed differences . It has been pointed out frequently that girls reach sexual maturity earlier than boys and that social problems arise from that condition . Many persons have commented upon differences in behavior of girls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making interpretations of these observed phenomena there is a tendency to overlook the fact that many cultural influences tend to offset the effects of actual physical differences . Home training of a particular adolescent may produce behavior that varies from that which is typical of his sex group . And it is that particular difference with which the counselor must deal , not the average obtained from the study of many persons . The counselor will not neglect the experimentally established differences between the sexes with respect to any characteristic , but he will use them primarily as a base from which he will launch his individualized investigations . Chronological age . Perhaps the most common question asked of a child , after he has been asked his name , is " How old are you ? When we have his answer , we begin immediately to make our own interpretations . We say he is big for his age , smart or dull for his age , well developed or puny for his age , and later , of course , wellpreserved for her age . Since few lay persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of persons of the // same chronologic age , " they find the observed diversity surprising , pleasing , or shocking depending upon the mental set before the information was obtained or upon the degree to which experience has taught caution . All are not as well informed as this small bespectacled boy from Boston:17 A kindly lady leaned over and asked him tactfully , " How old are you , my little boy ? " He removed his horn-rimmed spectacles and reflectively wiped them . " My psychological age , madam , is 12 years ; my social age is 8 years ; my moral age is 10 years ; my anatomical and physiological ages are both 7 years ; but I have not been apprised of my chronological age . It is a matter of relative unimportance . " Thereupon he restored his horn-rimmed spectacles . Chronological age has , however , become a common measure of development . Rulon " has indicated the extent to which we allow chronological age to be the determiner of expectations when we are considering the development of children . His statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( during certain childhood years ) with various kinds of performance . Our educational programs are founded upon the belief that certain abilities increase with increase in chronological age in the individual . Chronological age is apparently one of the concomitants of ability . And just as we try to get children 's achievements " to come up to the level of their abilities , " so we feel responsible for bringing the child 's achievement up to the level of his chronological age . In the case of chronological age we do not accept , and our colleagues do not impose on us , any responsibility for developing it in a child in which it seems to be too low ! Instead we allow chronological age to be the determiner and we make some other adjustment befitting it . We have permitted this factor of chronological age to determine many of our practices in dealing with children and youth . The child starts school when he is six , and he votes at twenty-one . With age as the determiner , he can be drafted to fight for his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconduct in adult // or juvenile courts is made upon the basis of age , and many employment and educational opportunities are limited to persons who have reached stated chronological ages . The presence of these legal stipulations , however , more than the evidence of commonality of characteristics of persons within age groups , requires the counselor to secure and verify a statement of each subject 's chronological age . It is necessary to point out to counselors , however , that a verified statement of age is unimportant ( other than for legal reasons ) only within certain reasonable ranges . Certainly the treatment of an infant may differ from that of a school child , and counseling with a high-school student may differ from that with an adult who must earn his own livelihood . An individual 's age does not determine the possession of specific characteristics within a period of several years and even , in some cases , over a long period of time ( both infants and adults , for example , can indulge in temper tantrums ) , but cultural factors operate to influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age levels with reasonable expectation of success . Although there is little difference between the observed behavior of an elementary-school child and a high-school boy , the counselor must consider , for example , the desirability of the latter 's leaving school while in the case of the former such a proposal might be as absurd as it is illegal . Experience . There is always the factor of experience to be considered . Extreme mental differences may make age factors of little importance in the evaluation of many kinds of experience , but when these are not present , the fact that the individual has lived longer will usually mean that he has met more people , has been exposed to more social pressures and liberties , has developed greater language facility , has experimented ( perhaps without full awareness of experimentation ) more in attempts at management of his environment , and has developed more variable modes of responding to situations which arise from day to day . But these conditions require that the counselor must not assume that certain characteristics will be present in a person of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been developed in each case . To offset the generalizations that laymen make about the relation of age to behavior , the counselor must become acquainted with some of the findings of psychologists so that he may use them in planning his procedures . There is no longer any doubt about the fact that adults can continue to learn long after the usual period // of formal schooling , " and there is considerable evidence to the effect that scores on intelligence tests continue to increase much beand that period of later adolescence which has frequently been reported to be the period of terminal growth . " These findings mean that the counselor may plan programs for the education of parents and adult groups . Further , he can do some planning with a student oncerning postschool education , which permits better current adjustments than could be made if he were certain that the termination of a subject 's formal schooling meant the completion of his education . Again , of course , the counselor will not let the apparent strength of the generalizations about adult intelligence and learning blind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working may be one of these persons who will not continue his education beyond the period of formal schooling . The counselor must obtain and verify the chronological age of all his counselees for his own protection when legal matters are involved.21 He will , however , make no inferences about the characteristics of his subjects on the basis of this datum , and , except within wide limits , he will find it of much less value than its frequent ment ion suggests . SUMMARY In this chapter certain sample problems in the collection and interpretation of data about counselees ' home backgrounds and health have been presented , and some of the problems raised by sex and age differences among student groups have been discussed . It has been indicated that counselors must go beyond the usual description of homes in terms of socioeconomic status if they are to understand the psychological atmosphere in which their counselees have been reared and in which they currently live . Procedures for collecting such information have been presented , and suggestions for work with teachers and parents on problems of parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge about counselees ' health history and status has been stressed , and the need for interpretation of this information in terms of indications and contra-indications for comity ? seling have been noted . It has been suggested that the counselor must not attempt the role of a specialist in this area . Methods by which he can encourage proper referral to specialists and supplement their efforts have been indicated . The counselor 's role in the health problem was interpreted to be that of stimulating the collection and use of health records , the avoidance of automatic and personal interpretations of health conditions , the discouragement of the use of popular but questionable screening devices , and the encouragement of counselees , parents , and school personnel to ensure that specialists ' recommedations are followed . It has been suggested that there is still much to be learned concerning the implications of health conditions for educational and vocational fitness . Special problems in the collection and collation of data for counseling which arise from sex and age-group differences have been illustrated , and certain cautions concerning the interpretation of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger of assuming that the individual counselee possesses the characteristics of the average of his age or sex group , and the need for consideration of the particular local circumstances that may produce behavior markedly different from the particular group of which the counselee is a part has been emphasized . It has been indicated that familiarity with the generalizations about sex and age groups which research has established is essential so that the counselor will have a sound base from which to launch his individualized study of each counselee . The need for verification of records by the counselor when legal matters are involved has been noted . // EXERCISE Indicate your reaction to the following statement concerning the relation of home and community conditions to the occurrence of delinquency . You have heard discussions of the slums , those miasmic swamps that menace lives , not only of those who dwell in them , but also of those who dwell beyond their borders . Picture yourself a restless , growing boy in your " teens , " living in one of the cold-water tenements ( in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . The family flat is poorly furnished , overcrowded , cold in winter and stifling hot in summer . There are three kids for every bed and two adults for every chair . Your parents are worn out with insufficient food and long hours of work . They find solace in a scuttle or two of beer every evening , and relief from tension in the quarrels which the beer engenders . They talk their native tongue and understand hardly a work of English . You are American , proudly so . You do not know the language of the old country and are contemptuous of it , and of your parents who speak it . Evening comes ? you do n't worry about your homework because %oil plan to play truant tomorrow . You go out into the streets , your playground . The public school in your neighborhood is dark ; it costs // too much to pay an evening janitor to keep it open . The gymnasium is dark ? the auditorium with its movie machine is dark ? the shop where you were developing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the corner , is not dark . Through the window you can see Limpy Louis , who has just beaten the rap on a burglary charge for the twentieth time , setting up the drinks for the house . In the place across the street Big Charlie , the policy-slip racketeer , is talking business at a corner table ? his Packard Roadster stands outside . Down the block a cellar club caters to a clientele that never earned an honest dollar . Your wants are simple , but there is no money at home to satisfy them . Even the 10-cent movie is out ? there are no extra dimes in your house . You meet Jimmie on the corner , and he suggests that you both hook a ride on the rear of a truck up to Blanc Street . There you meet some of the boys you were swimming with off an East River dock last Saturday ? and you go to their clubhouse ? a cellar room in a vacated tenement ? and hear the plans for a foray on a stoic that closes early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops seen strangers to you , and you go in on it . The job is pulled off successfully , the petty loot is disposed of to a fence , the proceeds are divided and you go home with $2 ? untold wealth ? in your pocket , and on your lips the ready excuse that you have been over at Hymie 's house . Your father beats you , because his father beat him when he was a boy , but he does n't learn about the $2 . And thus ? as naturally as that ? is the boy started on the road to juvenile delinquency and adult crime. * CASE EXERCISES PRISCILLA Priscilla scored well above average on scholastic-aptitude tests , but she was sociable rather than scholarly in interests . She wanted to satisfy her father 's ambitions for her , but she did not seem fitted on the basis of temperament or academic performance to enter the institution to which he was determined to send her . On most tests , Priscilla 's scores placed her on the border line between middle and upper third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her tests of scholastic aptitude indicated a level high enough to ensure success in college work if she was willing to work . Her best scores were achieved in tests of spatial facility and of speed and at. - // curacy in clerical work . Some weakness in vocabulary and reading speed and comprehension was indicated . In Grade XII , although her score on the Cooperative General Achievement Test in mathematics was low , the Q-score on the Thurstone Psychological Examination suggested that she could perform satisfactorily in mathematics and science in college . The unevenness of some of her scores over a five-year period supplemented the counselor 's impression that her interest and application varied on different tests from year to year . Priscilla 's father was an accountant . He was a high-school graduate who worked hard to achieve success in a financial organization and was determined that his daughter 's education would assure her of professional skill and social prestige . He was a precise , strong-willed person . He expected his daughter to compensate for his own failure to attend Harvard College . Priscilla 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , a former teacher , who showed considerable insight into Priscilla 's characteristics . She was unable to convince the father that his ambitions might have to be modified to take these into account , and there was considerable disagreement over the amount of discipline desirable to keep Priscilla working up to capacity . The mother 's lack of interest in her husband 's religious beliefs was an underlying factor in family disagreement . Priscilla seemed on friendly , affectionate terms with both parents . She treated differences of opinion with her father as insurmountable obstacles which were a nuisance but not worth worrying about . The home rated high on the Sims Socio-Economic Scale . It was a comfortable and well-furnished single house in one of the most prosperous residential districts . Business difficulties limited the family 's income during most of the time that Priscilla was in high school and made it impossible for her to afford college at more than commuting distance . Priscilla was always a bouncing , cheery , healthy-looking girl . She told the counselor that " I 've had perfect attendance in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't even have to lose my tonsils or adenoids . " No defects were recorded on the reports of the school physician after he had conducted a routine physical examination . Priscilla kept busy at sports , indoor games , knitting or crocheting , reading , listening to the radio , or just talking on the telephone with her many friends . She read half a dozen magazines and two or three books a month when there was " nothing more interesting to do . " She was usually with a number of girls , talking and laughing ( she even did so in class , to the annoyance of her teachers ) , and when the did settle down to study , it was with an air of conscious virtue . For five years she was a Girl Scout . She was enthusiastic until she // achieved First Class standing , and then she lost interest and dropped out . She participated in sports and made the class basketball and tennis teams in high school . She did enough backstage work on plays to get her points for Dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was more likely to spend her time with her group of girls . For three days a week during her senior year and during all tilt . following summer , she took care of the children of a friend of the family . She liked the work because she liked those particular children . Priscilla 's vocational choices , with the reasons which she gave , are indicated below . figure When first seen in the eighth grade , Priscilla appeared to the counselor to be a friendly , talkative young girl who told readily of her interests and activities . She was an A student except in English , drawing , and practical arts . Her Stanford Achievement Test scores gave her a grade equivalent of nine and age equivalent of fifteen before she was thirteen years old . She had scored exceptionally // high in the language and arithmetic sections of the test . She had been on the Honor Roll almost constantly during her school career , and it was likely that the intelligence quotient of 133 which she had achieved was a valid measure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking piano lessons for three years and appeared to be doing well . She had taken dancing lessons and had done so well that she began to consider dancing as a career . She had been a Girl Scout for some time and had done almost everything Girl Scouts are required to do . She had a collection of " samples " obtained by answering advertisements in magazines . Her interests and activities were so many that she found it difficult to get time to do her assignments . She said that she would like to be a secretary . It seemed to the counselor that she was capable of entering an occupation which demanded more training or , at least , of attaining an exceptionally high grade in secretarial work . She did suggest that she might want to train for a teaching career in a foreign language . Since she had not given a great deal of consideration to any vocational choice , and since there seemed to be no marked directional tendency , it seemed well for her to continue as she was doing and postpone making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade she began to think more about her vocational choice when she was required to select electives for high school . She would have preferred to enroll in courses in the fine and practical arts , but , owing to strong pressure from her father to prepare for teaching , she elected a college-preparatory program with Latin . This program left no room for more practical subjects . She was still so busy outside with sports , photography , gardening , and all the things she did with her girl friends that she was hard pressed to do her assignments , and her marks began to show the effects of her neglect of her studies . She agreed with her family that the school work must always be done first . It became apparent to her mother and to the counselor that Priscilla 's home study was just a chore to get out of the way so that she could carry on her other activities . Priscilla 's attitudes toward school were probably responsible for the decrease in the quality of her work in such cumulative subjects as French and Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not seem to master the grammar involved in translation from English into the other language despite the use of study aids suggested by teacher and counselor . She was handicapped also by the appearance of lack of confidence in speaking before large classes in the senior high school after she had left the protection of the group with whom she had studied previously . Oral English was a special ordeal for her , and it was a whole year before she really began to // enjoy class recitations again . In talking about this matter with thr counselor , she indicated that in spite of her father 's urgings she did not want to take training for the teaching profession . The counselor praised her achievement in English and social studies , suggested that she include another history course for her eleventh-grade elective , agreed to the dropping of Latin at the end of the year , and sup gested that she concentrate on a lighter program in her junior year as a real tryout of the possibility of succeeding in college work re . gardless of her vocational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the quality of her work improved steadily , she continued to be conscientious , but she did not do assignments with enthusiasm . She complained , in a friendly but definite fashion , about heavy home assignments , strict teachers , favoritism in marking , unfair exams , and failure to get the marks that she thought she deserved . Although her manner showed no real concern about passing her courses , she worried about them and on questionnaires , such as the Thurstone Personality Schedule and interest inventories , her responses suggested distress about failure to excel in school . She was still somewhat self-conscious about reciting in class , but she was happier now that she was better acquainted with the members of her classes . She gave no indication of genuine interest in the kind of liberal-arts education available in the top ranking women 's colleges toward which her father was directing her . Since her only interest in preparaing for Radcliffe College was to please her parents , various other schools and colleges were suggested for investigation . General readings on occupations were suggested to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in teaching , in secretarial work , and in related jobs in business , industry , and government service . In the case of secretarial work , executive positions to which secretarial jobs might be a steppingstone were stressed . She remained interested in all suggestions but uncertain about her choice . She was still casual and open in manner . She remained an engaging youngster with a twinkle in her eyes , well groomed , with a becoming curly coiffure . She continued her resolutions to show her father and mother just how much she could accomplish , and she expressed her attitude toward them by saying , " Mother and I would like to have me go away to a good , small coeducational college , or even stay here and go to a secretarial school and then become a secretary ? but it 's father you 'll have to convince . " Father could not be convinced ( during the interview that the counselor finally held with him while Priscilla was in her senior year of high school ) that his daughter was anything but lazy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my money . " The latter statement was pertinent because , at one point , Priscilla came // to the counselor for suggestions on how she could work her way through a business school . The counselor continued to provide information on more appropriate schools and colleges . The most appropriate seemed to be a near-by university 's College of Practical Arts and Letters , but her father would not consider it . Priscilla and her mother accompanied the counselor on a visit to the Registrar at Radcliffe , who warned her that admission was very doubtful and that it would depend entirely on results of the College Entrance Examination Board examinations . She prepared to take these examinations despite the warnings from all except one of her teachers and , although she tried hard , she failed in the chemistry exam completely and did too poorly on others to be accepted by two neighboring colleges . Her application to enter a local junior college was accepted , but her father refused to let her attend . On the day that colleges opened , she enrolled in a secretarial course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father . She did very satisfactory work there and was delighted with the combination of practical and academic subjects . She enjoyed participation in the extracurricular activities at the university . Her only regret was her definite failure to secure admission to Radcliffe College after she had tried so hard . She said , " I feel funny every time I go by the buildings . " She has definite plans to enter into personnel work by way of a secretarial job in the personnel office of a factory . DONALD Donald was referred to a counselor by his father who was disturbed because his son was not achieving the high level in school he thought desirable , and because he had observed that Donald was now less obedient than he had formerly been . The father was a professional man whose occupation required a high level of performance in language , and he was determined that Donald would follow in his profession . The counselor went into the matter of Donald 's interests by means of tests and long interviews . Donald indicated little interest in mechanical matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in social affairs . His strong interests , as expressed in tests , were literary and academic . In the interviews a little probing seemed to indicate that Donald was conforming to prescription rather than expressing his own preferences . He lived in a most unusual home situation . He had not attended the movies for a year , and his family did not allow a radio in the home because they thought he would learn poor English from it . Donald seemed to accept the parental dictates on these issues , but it was // easy to see that he was not too pleased about them . Most of his statements seemed to be repetitions of what he had been told by his parents . He hid his own feelings , except when he was caught off guard , and in these situations his own wishes in such matters came out . As soon as he had done so , however , he caught himself and followed through with statements which obviously came from his parents . He first said that he intended to enter his father 's occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so under any circumstances . He had made only two friends since coming to this city , and he said that he did not care very much about them . He disliked competitive sports because they involved body contact , and to a group of regular adolescents he was considered a " sissy . " He did carry on solitary outdoor activities , such as skiing and skating , but even in these activities the counselor had the feeling that he did them because he had been told that they were good for him . School Situation . David 's analysis and criticism of the curriculum to which he was exposed sounded very much like the criticism which progressive educators aim at the usual high-school curriculum . He had been required to read , in the common unsatisfactory school manner , one of Shakespeare 's plays . He had read it himself three times , had seen it acted , and knew it well . As a result , he was so bored in class that he made very little effort , and it was possible to see how he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad mark in the subject regardless of his accomplishment in it . His criticisms and analysis of the classes in his other subjects were very illuminating , and it could be seen that he had done a great deal of thinking about the materials in those classes ? much more than most students had . As a result of this thinking , he found little value in his courses and did not put forth his best efforts . Interpretation of Test Scores . Donald 's performance on the Binet test indicated superior development . Performance was at almost the same level throughout all the items in tests , except in vocabulary , where he made a superior score and in the reasoning with unfamiliar materials where the score was below his general average . This performance indicated that Donald could do very well on problems in which he could be tutored , but not so well in new material . His vocabulary score was at the level for superior college freshmen and was approximately 10 points higher than the average score mach by freshmen at the University of Wisconsin . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Paper Form-Board Test , which purports to measure a sort of nonverbal performance usually called " spatial relations , " yielded a score slightly higher than the average for his age , and there appeared to be no fundamental rea ? son why he should not do well in geometry . His mathematics score // was 98 out of a possible 130 . No particular strong or weak points were observed , and his performance was about average for boys of his age . This meant , of course , that there was also no reason why he should not have succeeded in the ordinary high-school mathematics . The speed-of-reading test and the clerical test indicated that Donald was a very slow worker . This lack of speed seemed to be an important factor in his lack of success because he admitted that he found it difficult to finish assignments and examinations in the usual time . With only the data given above , and with pressure on the part of the parents to get immediate action , what recommendations should a counselor make ? What additional data are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solution of Individual Problems PROBLEMS IN THE COLLATION OF DATA THE process of putting the data from all the sources discussed in previous chapters into usable form must be continuous throughout the whole period of counseling . And the process is one that can not be carried out successfully by an amateur . It requires painstaking and meticulous study of each datum separately , a study of the relationships among data obtained from separate sources , rejection of those items which are not sufficiently validated , and the organization of all the pertinent and dependable data into a portrait of the individual upon which action can be taken . ' The amount of responsibility involved in the process of collating data so that there will be a minimum of error in action will be appreciated by the counselor who feels that the counsel given to each o his subjects should be as good as he would want for his own child . And the counseling can not be better than the data upon which i proceeds . If human behavior were always simple , always direct , and a solutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history whic permitted the drawing of a master plan to be followed throughout the whole counseling period . The diversity , complexity , and insta bility of human behavior , however , make it necessary to obtain moving picture rather than a series of snapshots of an individua As a person grows under instruction , counseling , and experience 266 // new patterns of behavior begin to appear , and , as they do so , the counselor must add to his previous conceptualizations of the person , revise his previous estimates , reconsider previous plans , and weigh the probable outcomes of new proposals for action . Although the amount and number of revisions of conceptualizations and plans may vary from person to person , the counselor will usually find that at least one revision per year will be required if his subjects ' records are to be of value . At some remote time it may be possible to put numerical values on each datum in a case record and apply statistical techniques to the items so that the relationship of results from the application of many techniques may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then reveal the degree of relationship among data collected from many sources , and they may be useful in describing the extent to which one series of findings is verified by others . It may sometimes become possible to develop a forecasting technique that serves the same purpose for the individual as the regression equation does for groups . ' At the present time , however , such techniques are entirely in the realm of experimentation . ' Currently , they offer nothing for the practicing counselor other than a suggestion that he examine his data for relationships and trends so that he may improve his techniques . There is no incontrovertible evidence yet available which indicates that the counselor can substitute statistical manipulation of his data on a single case for the skill in interpretation that he has gained from experience in the study of individuals and the study of their postcounseling performances . Psychographs . The most common method of combining data about an individual is the profile , or psychograph . Though this technique produces fine charts and beautiful curves which seem to Indicate high validity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon become obvious when materi'als other than test scores for clearly defined and separated areas of subject matter are used . When , as in a subject field , it is assumed that the higher the score is , the better it is ; when all sources of data // are equally reliable ; and when it is assumed that the separate scores are independent of all others , the profile may be a very effective technique for portraying the characteristics of the individual . But the counselor must be concerned at times with traits in which neither very high nor very low scores are desirable . ' It is possible , of course , to adjust the scores to fit them into graphic patterns but , in doing so , the implications of middle-zone scores are likely to be lost . Further , as Allport ' has pointed out , the psychograph may conceal the qualitative balance between two or more traits . He says : A person whose profile dips in " ascendance " and rises in " expansion " has not shown merely low standing in one trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his behavior colored also by other co-existing traits , that eludes the psychograph completely . Discouraging as this discovery it , it follows inevitably from the false assumption that personality is the sum-total of plottings of scores on common variables . Allport 's statement was made with respect to the profiling of personality measures . The problem becomes even greater when the counselor attempts to incorporate data from several sources and various areas into a summary graph . Valuable as the profiles may be for the comparisons of individuals with respect to test scores in academic subject fields , it offers little promise for the collation of all the data about an individual which is necessary for counseling purposes . e Suggestions for collation of data about an individual . The task of putting data together in an experimental laboratory has been well stated by Murray ' as follows : " By the observation of many parts one finally arrives at a synthetic conception of the whole , and then , having grasped the latter one can re-interpret and understand the former . " The task of the practicing counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a synthetic conception // of the whole person and then ( realizing the inadequacy of his conception while he is under pressure to get results ! ) do something about them . The following report about Fay is presented here to suggest a method by which the counselor can combine his data from several sources into a report that will be more meaningful than a psychograph to school personnel , parents , and potential employers . The information about Fay was obtained from three 30-minute interviews , from an educational autobiography which she wrote as an assignment for a course in education , from observation of her during her class periods in that course , and from watching her while she painted a mural in a child development center . She had filled out a questionnaire covering her previous education , activities , and family background , and records of her academic achievement were available . The study of Fay was made to determine her potential effectiveness as a teacher , and consequently , there are many references to her personal adjustment , her general social attitudes , her response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her attitudes toward education and children . The nine paragraphs of this report contain a condensation of several hundred fragmentary pieces of evidence obtained from the sources indicated above . Fay 's behavior characteristics have not been classified into closely knit categories but the reader should read the report about her with these questions in mind : " Does she have the necessary personal characteristics for success as a teacher of art in a public school ? Would you want her as a teacher of your child ? " It should be noted that no attempt has been made to rate this young woman or to make an appraisal of her behavior . There would be no objections to making such ratings or appraisals after the reader had studied all the sources of data and had then read the descriptive paragraphs which follow . figure The method of collating data illustrated above in the case of Fay may be very disturbing to some readers . They may object to it because the language is too general , because there are no charts and few statistics , and because it presents no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing reports about individuals . To such critics we can only point out that the source of all statements has been indicated and that the counselor or any other person may go to the original material if he wishes to interpret or reinterpret the descriptions given . Even if he does not wish to read the original documents , it would seem more satisfactory to make ratings on appraisals after reading the condensed report than to have them presented originally in terms of profile of adjustment , sociability , work habits , and such terms as commonly appear in rating scales . A potential employer or admissions officer of an educational institution can place his own value upon the re . port and obtain clews from it which he can investigate further in // an interview . He is not required to accept scale values or numerical evaluations which someone else has devised and which may differ significantly from his own . PUTTING DATA TO WORK TO SERVE THE INDIVIDUAL General procedures . When the experimenter in the laboratory has collected , collated , and interpreted his data , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counselor has collected data about his subject he has just begun his work for he must put them to use by taking some action , by seeing that others take action , or , less frequently , by reaching the conclusion that no action is necessary . " Counseling is a practical job which permits no escape to an ivory tower and , too seldom , no opportunity to theorize about the data that have been obtained . Faced with the task of assisting hundreds of young people to adjust , to adapt , to choose , to rechoose , and to succeed , he can rarely allow himself the luxury of collecting data in the belief that they may be interesting and valuable even if no practical use of them is ever made . As a result of the counselor 's work , there will be a change in his subject 's behavior or his status and , at times , a change in both . In any case some progress must be made toward answering the questions which the subject has raised or which the counselor has suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselor must devise , borrow , improvise , and adapt various procedures to utilize data so that they will bring better understanding to the complex situations which appear in even the most commonplace counseling tasks . " Some samples of the methods that have been used successfully are listed below.12 // 1 . Students who are indulging in so many extracurricular activities that their schoolwork suffers may be asked to list these activities in order of preference . During conferences with the counselor , the least preferred activities may be eliminated . 2 . Counselees who do not respond well to the efforts of counselors and other school personnel may occasionally be assisted by arranging for their association with volunteer business or professional men in the city . A " Big Brother " committee can be formed in any community . " 3 . Students who exhibit extreme types of behavior but who have similar interests may be brought together in a sort of " buddy " system to help each other . Thus , a very shy girl and a girl described by her teachers as obnoxiously bold who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the counselor has done so , and encouraged to help each other . Frequent checks are necessary to see if the contacts are maintained and if they are helpful . 4 . Subjects may be assisted in difficulties that arise from doubts about their own performances by frank discussion of what tests reveal about their strengths and weaknesses . Exact numbers need not be given , but interpretations in thirds , quarters , or even tenths of a class distribution may be used effectively . 5 . Counselees may be helped by giving them opportunities to talk about their problems to a counselor who simply listens to them , encourages them to talk , and asks them to state and restate the issues involved . 6 . Information about development in childhood and adolescence may be interpreted to assist parents who are confused about their children 's behavior . Knowledge of the fact that there is no relationship between the timing of the preadolescent growth spurt and physical size at maturity , " for example , may help to alleviate the worries of both par- // ents and children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make curious interpretations of such phenomena . 7 . The cumulative records of students may be interpreted to parents . At times this procedure results in the scaling down of too ambitious parental plans , and in raising them where the performances of youth warrant it . Alternative lines of action should be explored with such parents . /8 . Opportunities for students to play significant and useful roles in classes , schools , or communities may be arranged with the cooperation of parents , teachers , and principals . / 9 . Transfers from one school to another , or from one class to another in the same school , may be arranged . All the subjects and the adult personnel involved in the transfers should be prepared for the changes by instruction , reports , and conferences . " Blind " transfers , in the hope that a new situation will automatically result in changed behavior , are seldom effective . - 10 . Information concerning scholarship and contest opportunities may be made available to school personnel , parents , and pupils . Every school should maintain an up-to-date file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be recommended.1 ' These may be books or pamphlets about occupations and educational institutions , acceptable modes of deportment , " how to study " materials , descriptions of behavior of certain groups , and various self-help materials . /12 . Tryout experiences for students in many fields of study , in occupations , and in tasks requiring special skills may be arranged . 13 . Visits to various persons and places for purposes of observation , interview , and consultation may be arranged . In the // study of local occupational opportunities , for example , committees of students who are interested in specific vocations may visit a local place of business , observe the practices in it , consult employees or employers , request that the person who was interviewed come to the school to talk to a class about the vocation , and devise with their classmates the questions that will be asked during a discussion period . With increased bus service available to many schools , it is now possible to make many visits to potential places of employment and to educational institutions . Such visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded and followed by carefully planned preparation and discussion . 14 . Occasionally a student may be removed from regular classes for various lengths of time or at regularly scheduled periods , so that he may participate in substitute experiences . a . A student may be given the opportunity to work on projects that cut across regular subject-matter areas . See , for example , the work on machines done by Roy in the description of his work which appears below . He studied history by investigating the development of machines , wrote his English themes about them , learned much science by investigating the processing of metals used in machines , and reviewed mathematics by using them in machine-shop situations . A part-time job was obtained for him in a factory where he operated and provided maintenance for a machine . b . Correspondence and self-teaching courses may be provided for a student whose special needs are not met by the common school curriculums . The success of such courses provided by the United States Armed Forces Institute for members of the armed forces suggest that students may profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist a student who has missed much of the regular schoolwork because of illness , or who has particular difficulties in certain subjects . // d . School credit may be given to students for work experience in the community . e . School routines may be modified to fit particular home circumstances . A girl , who came to a small high school unwashed and foul-smelling because she did not have time to complete the process of cleaning up after milking fourteen cows before she came to school , was permitted to absent herself from the first home-room period in the morning so that she could be well-prepared for the second . This permission was granted only after a thorough study of her home situation and conferences with her parents . Failure to make the concession for the first period would have meant withdrawal of the girl from school by her parents who insisted that her services were needed at that time , or continued rejection of her by other students who objected to the odors and her disordered appearance . 15 . Students may be referred to specialists for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such experts within a school or college as those in remedial reading , to experts in outside agencies , such as the psychoeducational clinics at universities , state rehabilitation agencies , county mental-health centers , or to private practitioners , such as psychiatrists or psychologists . Referrals , with the cooperation of local physicians , may be made to specialists in various fields of medicine . In general , clinics or other special agencies that provide diagnosis without treatment should be avoided . Referrals should not be made to private guidance agencies which do not utilize records of previous performances of their clients . Specific procedures illustrated . At times the counselor may be required to work out with a counselee , or with others , suggestions of action for him , for his parents , and for the personnel of the school . These are most likely to be effective if they are drawn up with each person separately , a carbon copy made , and the carbon given to the individuals who are concerned . At the time when the // suggestions are made , a second appointment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made upon the action which was planned . In the following case of Roy , an eleventh-grade boy who had been involved in many conduct difficulties in school , who showed rather marked tendencies toward delinquency , and who " loved " machines , the following suggestions for action were drawn up separately in conference with Roy , with his parents , and with the principal of the school . Each was given a carbon copy , and periodic checks were made to see if the suggestions had been carried out.1 ' The action in this particular case was so effective that even the students in the school remarked upon the improvement in Roy 's behavior . During the period of one year he changed from the school 's leading troublemaker to one of its best citizens . It must be noted that the plans applied only to Roy 's case . They might be wholly unsatisfactory for other students and even for Roy under other conditions . ROY Plans for Parental Action Drawn Up by the Counselor and Roy 's Parents ( Reasons for the dont 's had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brackets. ) 1 . Do n't call him Junior . Call him Roy . Roy resented the implications of childishness in the name " Junior . " 2 . Do n't compare him with Jimmie . Younger brother . Do n't show Jimmie 's pictures when Roy is present . Parents had often made odious comparisons between Roy and Jimmie. 3 . Praise him for the skillful work he does in the school shop . Roy had begun to doubt that anyone would appreciate anything that he did. 4 . Encourage football participation . Go to the games , and praise him when he is successful . 5 . Take the pressure off the boy . Stop nagging . Overlook all minor difficulties for the time being . Try not to scold once between now and the end of the term . 6 . Boys of this age usually prefer companions of their own age at the movies rather than their parents . Do n't force your presence upon him . His parents had decided to go with him when he went out so that they could watch him. // 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is essential . Let him know that attendance at a mechanics institute might be possible after he finishes high school . 8 . A good deal of Roy 's difficulty appears to be due to the fact that you have been trying too hard to get him to do what you consider to be the right thing . Stop prodding him . It 's going to be difficult to do this but the success of the plan depends on it . Plans for Action by.Personnel of the School Drawn Up by the Principal and the Counselor 1 . See that Roy knows exactly why he is doing what he is required to do in school this year and next . This means that the planning of his program must be done with him and that he be told why certain subjects are offered and required . 2 . Provide for a review of elementary arithmetic through a project which has meaning to him . Shop or drawing might provide the opportunity . This was provided through his work in general shop. 3 . Give him a great deal of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4 . If he can get a part-time job , give him school credit for time spent on the job . 5 . A project which cuts across regular curricular lines should be drawn up so that he will not be required to attend all regular classes . A project on machines was arranged and he wrote and spoke about machines in his English classes , studied the history of machines as a major project in his history class , did mathematics related to his shop assignments , and spent two periods a day in the school shop . 6 . Whenever you try to force this boy you can expect him to fight back and react in a way which is described as stubborn or determined . He wo n't " be pushed around " by anyone but will respond to pleasant treatment . Teachers agreed to try this and they were very pleased with Roy 's response . Plans for Action by Roy Worked Out with the Counselor 1 . Try to finish school without any more trouble this year so that the principal and teachers will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion was made after many interviews with Roy and after he saw that the counselor did not want to " push him around . " The effect of his behavior on teacher 's attitudes was thoroughly discussed. ) // 2 . Try for one week ( at a time ) to do better schoolwork . It can be done . Roy 's test scores were interpreted for him , and this procedure eliminated many doubts which he had about himself . He had begun to think that people were right when they called him " dumb . " 3 . Work at the canning factory this summer . Save half your pay for next year and spend the rest for a trip . Roy was sure that he wanted to travel . A bus trip to the northern part of the state was arranged after he had worked for six weeks and he enjoyed the opportunity to get away from home for a short period. 4 . Draw up a plan of study for next year and present it to the principal with a statement that you think you can carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . Note program described above . Roy 's case is not presented here as an ideal solution to any problem other than his . The plans made here were drawn up after careful study of him , of his parents , and of the personnel of the school which he attended . They were intended to apply only to him , and their effectiveness is shown by his improvement in behavior in school and in his postschool career . If any of the conditions in school or community or home had been different , or if Roy had been other than the kind of person he was , the plans might not have been effective . Roy was a fellow who really needed a friend , someone who did not scold , prod , or blame . It should be noted that much of the work was verbal and that the suggestions to him did not vary greatly from those which had been given to him by others . The chief difference was in the attitude of the counselor who had recognized the fact that Roy had not gone beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons required . The procedures that have been outlined above require active participation of many persons within the school and community.17 They demand that such persons understand the objectives of the counseling process and that they accept or devise some basic guiding statements such as
