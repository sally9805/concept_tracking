In the sprawling Casa del Pueblo , Apra headquarters in Lima , baggy , beaming Apra Chief Victor Raul Haya de la Torre faced his weekly " leaders ' class . " This time the men on the hard benches in the whitewashed , barnlike hall got no lesson on public speaking or Peruvian finance . <P> The Jefe , just back from a flying trip to the U.S. , wanted to tell about his trip to New York City and especially of his visit with Albert Einstein at Princeton . <P> The great mathematician had been interested in Haya 's theory of relativity in history. * He had agreed enthusiastically with Haya that only continental American unity can save the U.N. , and had said that unity must be achieved " now . " <P> Afterwards , Pedagogue Haya , whose left-wing political movement began as a workers ' university a quarter of a century ago , got down to party business . Because gringo eyes are on Apra , he warned , Aprista pupils must work harder than ever . Classes must be expanded . Discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Haya , must learn that strikes are weapons of last resort and must not be used irresponsibly , for " that would be like a traffic cop pulling out a revolver and shooting every time someone crossed the street on a red light . " <P> If Peru 's anti-Apra press ever printed anything about Haya , this last injunction would have been news . Apra had often used gangster methods in politics ; it had been blamed for the still unsolved murder last January of Rightist Editor Francisco Grana ( TIME , Jan. 20 ) . Perhaps now Peru 's dominant party was going to restrain itself . At least the Jefe had given the word . <P> <P> *Its essence : in history , time is a function of space ; whereas all Europe lives roughly in the 20th Century , in Peru the coast is 20th , the Indian highlands 16th , the Amazon basin still prehistoric . The main conclusion : European theories can not be applied mechanically to America , as the Marxists vainly think .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
