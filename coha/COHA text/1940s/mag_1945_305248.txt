Music is an old , sweet story to nuns of the Roman Catholic Church . For some eighteen centuries they have been chanting matins and vespers in their convent chapels . Last week , in Chicago 's austere Orchestra Hall , a choir of 80 nuns sang on a public stage , for the first time in history . <P> The daring idea was a man's-husky , grey-haired Father William J. Finn ( TIME , July 24 ) , onetime choirmaster of Manhattan 's Church of St. Paul the Apostle , who trained and directed his singers as a " demonstration " in his lifelong fight to revive Renaissance music . Irreverent observers ( who nonetheless have a wholesome respect for Father Finn 's showmanship ) promptly dubbed the choir " Finn 's Jennies . " The talkative , 63-year-old conductor called them " esthetically aware . " <P> Father Finn had qualms about his two-hour concert of classic sacred music ( Palestrina , Vittoria , Brahms , Mendelssohn ) ; he thought it might be " a little on the gay side . " To rehearse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had developed during 40 years with boys ' choirs ( stretching the singers out on table and piano tops for breathing exercises ) : " Of course , in the case of the sisters that just is n't done . . . . They are dedicated to an unworldly life . No Delilah business , you know . " <P> The sweet , soft voice texture which stirred and delighted Chicagoans , Father Finn achieved by instructing high sopranos to sing moo ; low sopranos , mee ; first altos , mah ; second altos , maw . " When you hear them mooing and making and everything , it 's like listening to a lot of flutes . " <P> Now that the ice is broken , " Finn 's Jennies " will go on making Chicago appearances , but Father Finn ca n't visualize a road tour : " I 've done so much barnstorming myself , I 'm as bad as Ethel Barrymore . But you ca n't have the sisters singing one-night stands . . . . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
