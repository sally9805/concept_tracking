txt A development of utmost importance to the Axis will take place tomorrow , when Premier Mussolini and Reichsfuehrer Hitler are scheduled to meet . Once again the course of events has brought about a situation that needs firm decisions from the highest quarters . Once more Spring is approaching ? a traditional period of great offensives . Last year , on March 18 , before the Germans began the series of decisive moves that were to take them to Denmark and Norway and later through the Netherlands , Belgium and France , Signor Mussolini and Herr Hitler met at the Brenner Pass . There has been no such conference since they met in Florence on , Oct. 28 , the day the Greek campaign started . Since then startling things have happened , but the next meeting must be held in Germany , since it is customary to alternate . Diplomatic advices in Switzerland said the dictators might meet in Salzburg or Munich , according to The Associated Press . Berlin dispatches reported indications that closer and more aggressive Axis collaboration in all phases of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave subjects on which the Axis must make grave decisions  --  the Mediterranean , Britain and the United States . Already German airmen have come down into Italy to collaborate with the Italian Air Force in the Mediterranean . Whether this collaboration is to be extended has to be decided . The Italian problems of Albania and Libya and the German one of Bulgaria and the Eastern Mediterranean also need some sort of a solution . Britain is a purely German problem in so far as an invasion is concerned , but the possible effect of such a move on the war as a whole and the part the Mediterranean will play at the psychological moment are certainly something to be discussed . Finally , it is clear that . the attituee of the United States is beginning to reach a point where the Axis partners must decide how far they are willing to let the situation develop without trying to halt the aid that Britain is getting from America . Events are moving fast in Washington , so the Axis must think fast and decide what it wants to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help will arrive too late and therefore it is not necessary to do anything . Or it may be that the best thing to do is to take a strong stand while the United States is still relatively weak . Economic Parley to Open One indication of the way affairs are moving toward a new phase came this morning with the announcement that Dr. Karl Militia is arriving in Rome on Monday with a delegation of thirty-five economic experts to take part in an important meeting of the ItaloGerman Economic Commission . These meetings take place periodically , but it is unusual for such a large body of experts to come along . Decisions involving the occupied I countries as well as Rumania and Hungary are expected . The continuance of the war month after month brings ever new prob-1 lems , since the economic strain is cumulative . To meet the drain on food , clothing , fuel and other necessaries , the Axis must either reduce consumption or find new sources of supply . For the more satisfactory distribution of the raw materials and food available fn the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eco- I nomic problems will be solved . There are so many articles and editorials about the United States and aid to Britain in Italian publications that it would take columns to cite them . A new policy of giving full accounts , however unpalatable , of what men like Secretary of the State Cordell Hull , Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox are saying has been introduced , so that the newspapers now give great space to dispatches from Washington . The Italian people are not going to have many illusions about the sentiments and intentions of the United States by the time the Foreign Affairs Committee complete its hearings . Virginio Gayda , as usual , is their leading spokesman . He has a long editorial today based on the premise that , since no country threatens the United States . the United States must be the aggressor nation . America , he says , is following a policy of " clandestine intervention and open provocation with the most open violation of international law , " expecting that the Axis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it shall be blamed for aggression . This time it is Signor Gayda who places before . the Italian public a supposedly confidential official document of the Senate Naval Committee . Where these documents are coming from and how many there are is still a mystery , but yesterday Giovanni Preziosi in the Vita Italians cited from a similar report . Signor Gayda 's document is a report on the naval bill that came before the committee on May 15 , 1910 . The report allegedly says the interests of the United States are at peace and that it is essentially an island whose problems can be solved with a strong defensive navy and there is no necessity for any military alliances . The United States is unprepared and would have to make grave sacrifices of life and material if it entered the war , the report continues . There is no threat of a foreign power . Therefore , Signor Gayda argues , the United States is deliberately going out of the way to attack the Axis .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
