No more radio sets for U.S. civilians will be made after April 22 . By the end of June there will probably be no more on the market . The U.S. , which bought 13,100,000 sets last year , heard this news last week from the War Production Board . <P> Under a previous WPB order cutting down civilian production by 40% , many radio manufacturers were already far along in conversion to war work . WPB warned all of them last week that any facilities not required in making military radio equipment must be converted within " three or four months " to war production of other kinds ( e.g. , bomb sights ) . <P> Radio equipment was more badly needed in the Pacific than in the U.S. living room or car . On behalf of U.S. Army &; Navy procurement and the Netherlands Indies purchasing commission , the American Radio Relay League appealed last week to radio " hams " to sell their apparatus to their country .                  @ @ @
