txt Efforts to obtain improved air service for Boston are to reach a climax on March 27 when Boston and New England commercial and aviation interests are scheduled to appear before the Civil Aeronautics Board in Washington on its hearings for air route applications for services into New England . At that time the Board is to hear ? applications for extensions of routes or to provide additional service to Boston and New England communities which have been made by American Airlines , Northeast Airlines , United Air Lines , Transcontinental and Western Air , Inc. , Eastern Air Lines , Colonial Airlines , and Seaboard Airways , Inc . The last named company is the only non-operating firm among these applicants . Certain recommendations regarding these applications already have been made by special examiners of the CAB . These recommendations , while they ? influence the Board 's action , do not necessarily determine it . Briefly , here is what has been proposed by CAB examiners : Recommendations That Northeast Airlines , which now serves northern New England , be permitted to extend its route south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence , Worcester , and New Bedford , which do not now have air service ; and Hartford , Conn. , Providence , R. I. , and Newark , N. J. , which do have air service . That American Airlines , which is now the only Boston-New York operator , be permitted to serve the additional intermediate cities of Worcester , New Bedford , the **26;157;TOOLONG area , and Waterbury , Conn. , none of ' which is served by air . That the applications of Colonial , Eastern , United , TWA , and Seaboard , . for service from New YOrk to Boston , be  --  denied . None ' Of these recommended services could be inaugurated until after the war , it is assumed , or until such time as the ' military authorities released enough transport planes which they have commandeered to make such services feasible . Yet , even before such services ave been inaugurated , local in-rests , notably the Boston Chamer of Commerce , the Boston Port Luthority , and the Cambridge hamber of Commerce , feel that these projected extensions will rovide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and New England will le the victim of " unjustified in , iscrimination , " said Henry J. lichols , President of the Boston 7 , hamber of Commerce , in a statenent issued today , if the Board urns down the application for hrough trunk line air service ) etween Boston and the South ind the West . In a recent letter to all mein . ) ers of the CAB and the New Engand Congressional delegation in Washington , the Boston Chamber , roiced its opposition to the CAB Examiner 's report . It urged that the CAB certify applications for additional air routes to meet the " growing demands " of Boston and New England . The Chamber was careful to point out that its attitude was in no sense a reflection on the service which American and Northeast have given Boston and New England . " This service is probably the best that could be provided under wartime restrictions , " the Chamber statement said , " and doubtless it will be improved when conditions allow . " In its advocation of additional trunk line air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber emphasized ? the potential postwar need for it and listed three significant factors : 1 . Metropolitan Boston has a population of 2,351,000 and the area within a 50-mile radius of the city has a population of 4 , - 300,000. 2 . Boston is the fifth largest metropolitan area in the United States , and except for New York is the most densely populated . 3 . Under normal conditions air travel between Boston and New York is heavier than on any route in the United States . Nevertheless , so far only one carrier has been authorized to operate this route . The Cambridge Chamber resolutions took substantially the same line as the Boston Chamber . An analysis of the projected extension already proposed by the CAB examiners discloses : 1 . By the Northeast extension to New York , air travelers from Boston would for the first time have a choice of two companies . 2 . Northeast , furthermore , would become a strong regional company and serving New England would become its most earnest consideration . 3 . American . Airlines would still remain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York . 4 . Peacetime restoration of American 's war-cancelled service from Boston to Springfield , Albany , Buffalo , and Detroit to Chicago would provide an additional and direct trunk line to the west . Further analysis discloses that extension of Eastern Air Lines , for instance , to Boston would provide the Hub with through service to the South and Gulf Coast , with direct connection to Latin America . United 's projected service from Cleveland and Hartford , Conn. , to Boston would provide a throti , h direct service to the Central Pacific and Northwest area . Outstanding question in th opinion of local aeronautical circles would be whether the Boston-New York would become a " starvation " route for three operators or whether two operators could more comfortably divide the business with profit to themselves . Statistics have disclosed that fully three-quarters of the air passengers traveling to New York from Boston have New York as their destination . It would he vital , therefore , for a New England operator such as Northeast to make a profit on the New York route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transcontinental operator , nevertheless , his primary interest would lie in the long-haul , passenger .
