With her gray hair pulled tightly away from her wrinkled face , she sat in the witness chair with apparent calm but her gnarled fingers were clasped tightly in her lap . She seemed alone in the crowded old courtroom . Neither her grand . daughter , Mrs. Jean Martin , 25 , mother of little Donald Eugene , in whose body chemists found 4.1 grains of arsenic , or her daughter , Mrs. - Gerald Burton , who sobbed thruout the testimony , glanced in her direction . Eyes of Others on /ler But the eyes of 300 men and women who jammed the Wayne county courtroom were upon her . Most of the spectators were women clad In summer house dresses . They fanned tnemseives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in overalls lounged on the benches , many of them chewing tobacco with concentrated rhythm . It was ' for the most part an elderly throng which had come to witness the murder trial of a friend and neighbor . Earlier in the day 13 of them mounted the witness stand to testify they had known Mrs. Winter for " nigh on to 50 years or so . " " I 've known Mrs. Winter for a good 35 years and she was a good , I honorable citizen , " W. H. Jewel , al farmer , said . " If you wanted help ; she 'd give it to you and if you didn't1 she did n't butt in . But then , you know , there is n't anybody perfect . " Small but Clear Voice Mrs. Winter walked to the wit . ' ness chair more briskly than many of her neighbors . With a tight smile , she answered the questions of her lawyer , Charles W. Creighton , in a ' small but clear voice .

" BY your children you mean whom ? " Called Her " Mamma " " I mean my daughter , Mary Burton ; my granddaughter , Jean Martin , who I raised from a baby , and her two children , Donald and Judy . They ' all called me ' mamma , ' even little Donald . I did not love any one better than the other . I made no difference between them . " At the direction of her attorney ' Mrs. Winter faced the jury and told of the happenings on June 15 , the date of Donald 's death in her farmhouse outside town .

" Jean wanted to take Donald in to the doctor , hut I told her he was too sick . While she was gone , he vomited In a small pan and on my hands . Without thinking I threw the contents out in the , yard and washed my hands . " Earlier In the day Mrs. Martin had testified to the disappearance of the pan . ' She said her grandmother told her to be very careful what she told officers . She said Mrs. Winter warned , " I have already told them about It and I do n't want you to get mixed up and give them a different story .

It was overruled by Circuit Judge Caswell Crebs . " I am not filing a dilatory motion , " Creighton argued . " I am sincere . We admit that little Donald died of arsenic poisoning but there is nothing to prove that the defendant administered it or that she even had It in her possession . A thoro investigation was made of the farm and the house for a vial or evidence of arsenic before Mrs. Winter had any knowledge of the chemical analysis . All dispensaries were checked to see if she had purchased any . Nothing was found . " Mrs. Winter took Jean into her home as a baby . She raised her as she did her daughter .

" I do n't think my mother did It , " she sobbed . Mrs. Winter watched her daughter anxiously and then suddenly left her chair beside her attorney . She crossed to the bench , placed her wrinkled hand upon her daughter 's head , and , bending down , murmured something softly . Mrs. Burton did not look up . The little woman In black stood motionless for a moment and then somewhat dejectedly returned to her chair . " I 'm not nervous , " she announced determinedly to a nearby reporter . " I ' have nothing to be nervous about . " Smiles at Each Evidently many of her neighbors thought the same .
