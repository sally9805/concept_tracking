From his bench in New Delhi last week India 's Chief Justice Sir Maurice Linford Gwyer handed down a bombshell decision : Mohandas K. Gandhi , Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and 8,000 other Congress party leaders were being illegally detained by the Viceroy 's Government . Reason : Rule No. 26 , of the Defence of India Act , under which the Congress leaders were arrested and have been held without trial since last August , was invalid because " it went beyond the powers which the Legislature thought fit to confer on the Central Government . " <P> Crux of Chief Justice Gwyer 's decision was that numbers of prisoners in India may have been arrested on the slimmest of evidence . He ruled : " There is no power to detain a person because the Government thinks that he may do something hereafter or because it thinks that he is a man likely to do it ; there must be suspicions based on reasonable grounds that he is actually about to do it . " <P> Chief Justice Gwyer 's decision made the behavior of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Queensberry . But it brought no change in the status of the arrested Congress leaders . <P> The India Office in London plunked the fizzing bombshell in a pail of water , announced that the law will be revised to fit the punishment .
