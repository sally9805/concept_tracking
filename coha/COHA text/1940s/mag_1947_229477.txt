BEND SINISTER ( 242 pp. ) - Vladimir Nabokov-Holt ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> This novel , like Joseph Conrad 's The Nigger of the Narcissus , shows how heady a wine the English language may be for a foreign writer of parts who has thoroughly acquired it . Bend Sinister , Vladimir Nabokov 's second novel in English ( he has written seven in Russian ) , is one of the most intelligent nightmares of dictatorship in modern fiction . It is also a lip-smacking over the flavors of English prose to rouse the tired syntax in 10,000 editorials . Nabokov 's style glimmers with reflections of many great styles ( Gogol 's , Flaubert 's , Joyce 's ) and yet is distinctly his own : rapid , brilliantly metaphorical , daintily savage and smooth . The reader , never bored , can run his own blue pencil through Nabokov 's excesses , such as the " anal ruby " of a bicycle . He will not have to use the pencil often . <P> In form , Bend Sinister is a frank piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , it tells the story of Philosopher Adam Krug during a revolution in a dream country which has strong resemblances to Germany , to Russia and , in certain aspects , to the U.S. The frightened faculty of his university call on Philosopher Krug to intercede for their institution with the new dictator , Paduk ( nicknamed the Toad ) , who was a clammy schoolmate of Krug 's 30 years before . Krug refuses ; the dictatorship goes on . <P> The " Harmonious Majority . " Life under the Ekwilist ( equalitarian ) regime is sketched by Nabokov with a disgusted charm unequaled by contemporary satirists . He has an ear for the obscene overtones of the dictator 's loudspeaker : " ' From now on , ' continued the tremendously swollen Tyrannosaurus , ' the way to total joy lies open . You will attain it , brothers , by dint of ardent intercourse with one another ... by adjusting ideas and emotions to those of a harmonious majority ... by letting your person dissolve in the virile oneness of the State . ' " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places side by side , heightened by the selectivity of an adept and angry writer , the most moronic abominations of totalitarianism and the finest lights of the secular European mind . The hoaxed and flattered humanity of the mass man is contrasted with the honest and deeply suffering humanity of the individual ; but all this is done so lightly that it seems a mocking and superior amusement . <P> When the Ekwilist State triumphs , murdering innocence , Nabokov 's style is still playful , but it takes on a Swiftian intensity . Krug goes mad . And it is clear that the professor 's doom ( which is Europe 's ) came about not merely because he was honorable , but because he was vain , obtuse to evil , and absorbed in his own past .
