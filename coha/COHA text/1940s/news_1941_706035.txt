txt The National Defense Mediation Board in two cases today rejected the demands of American Federation of Labor unions for union shops or strong union security clauses as the compensation for no-strike agreements . In one of the cases , involving 4 , M0 American Federation of Labor metal trade workers at the Pascagoula , Miss. , yard of the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation , the board declined to give the A. F. of L. a union shop or even a " maintenance of membership " clause , although the issues in the dispute were virtually identical with those at the Kearny , N. J. , shipyard of the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company , which was commandeered by the Navy after the company refused to accept a board decision requiring present and future C. I. 0 . union members to remain in good standing as a condition of employment . Two plants of the International Harvester Company at Rock Island , Ill. , and Milwaukee , Wis. , were involved in the other ruling . This was not a final decision , but it was made plain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be refused . The board recommended further negotiations between the two parties , pending an investigation of wage issues , and suggested that the final contract include a clause under which the company would urge all its employes to join the union and remain in good standing and under which the employer would discipline workers who engaged in antiunion activity on company time and property . Asked to explain the apparent inconsistency between the Kearny and Pascagoula cases , which were decided by different board panels , a Mediation Board spokesman said that " the need for union security // TWO NDMB RULINGS REJECT UNION SHOP // in the Pascagoula case was such that the board felt it would be satisfied by the present recommendation . " At both Kearny and Pascagoula. the workers are covered by zone shipbuilding stabilization pacts sponsored by the Office of Production Management . These forbid strikes for two years , and in each case the union urged that it should not be called upon to sign the no-strike clause without some correlative clause which guaranteed security to it . In the Pascagoula case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions represented 95 to 97 per cent of the workers , a panel of Walter T. Fisher , a lawyer , of Chicago ; W. A. Calvin , A. F. of L. official , and Eugene Meyer , editor and publisher of The Washington Post , unanimously turned down the demand for a union shop and accepted instead a company proposal for a clause reading : " The company advocates that those that are now members or who may become members of the union continue their membership and will cooperate with the union for the purpose of carrying out this agreement , provided it 113 understood that their obligation to cooperate will not require the company to discharge a man for nonpayment of dues or non-membership in the union . " The company will fully instruct its supervisory employes as to the terms and conditions of this agreement and will discipline any such employes violating the terms hereof or advocating a policy contrary to that set out herein . " The company believes the interests of the employes are best served by being members of the union and looks with favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now members or who become members continuing their membership . " AU things being equal and when practicable , members of the said union will be given preference in the hiring of men when said members have registered with the employer 's employment office and with the union 's and are available within twenty-four hours . " The company will not support or encourage any dual union and will not recognize any union of production or maintenance employes other than those with which it has contractual relations through the Metal Trades Department , affiliated with the American Federation of Labor , which is certified by the National Labor Relations Board as sole collective bargaining agent . The company will print copies of this agreement and will furnish each employe a copy thereof . " The board said that it was its opinion that the company 's clause " if carried into operation with good faith upon the part of both parties , should form a basis for stable relations between the company and the union and guard the security of the union during the life of the contract , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union shall believe that any supervisory employe of the company is not in good faith carrying out the policies announced herein , upon written request of the union the company will join it in requesting the attendance at Pascagoula of some disinterested person designated by the National Defense Mediation Board for the purpose of investigating the complaint . " If such person shall deem it necessary , then at a meeting attended by such employe , a representative of the company , a representative of the union , and such person designated by the National Defense Mediation Board , such supervisory employe shall be advised in what manner and to what extent he has deviated from such policies and shall be instructed not to repeat the offense . " If a union shall so request , the National Defense Mediation Board will at the present time or at some other time appoint such a disinterested person to proceed to Pascagoula to study the situation in advance of any complaint being made .
