txt Southern California , which for many years has thumbed-down world fairs because " they are too oldfashioned for this area 's modern way of doing things . " may put on a global shindig after all Victory . peace and progress would he its theme . This apt label could celebrate equally well either the winning of World War II or an ending of the wordy battles which have raged for years between those who want a fair here and those who do n't Backers of the fair have two big pegs on which to hang their campaign . The exhibition would stretch over two years , 1919. 100th anniversary of the , da , covery of gold In California , and 1900. centennial year of California 's statehood . If the fair finally comes to pass and prospects for it are improving , naturally it will be stupendous . Even now , with only hopes to ge on . plans are colossal to say the least . For example . there 's the scheme to build a " White Houle of the West . " duplicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President and his cabinet would be invited to make it their summer home during the fair years . In between times it would provide room and board for visiting dignitaries Another idea is to put the entire II S Navy on view in Los Angeles harbor The Navy 's views on this proposal are unlcnown At the entrance of the harbor a huge Statue of Peace would he constructed . It would also house a world-wide shortwave broadcasting station to carry news of the fair-doings to all those unfortunates who live too far away to attend the show in person . " Hollywood 's movie-makers , of course , can be counted on not to hide out during the fair . Their planning still has n't reached the top brackets of descriptive adjectives , but at least they 've made a modest beginning . For one thing they talk of installing a complete movie studio , sound-proofed and encased all in glass , so fair-goers can view actual shooting of feature pictures.There 'll also be a. museum of the cinema 's past glories . The fair would roam far and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the permanent tourist attractions and make southern Cali-forma one big fair ground . Bose Bowl Game Would Be Featured For instance . the program probably will include Pasadena 's annual Tournament of Roses and the Rose Bowl football game : the Hollywood Bowl concerts : and the horse races at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park . Los Angeles . which hopes for a new civic auditorium reasonably soon , probably would rush it to completion in time for concerts and operas . There has n't been much said as yet about industrial exhibits . Chances are they would be scattered all over the metropolitan area and probably would feature such enterprises as oil production , plane factories and ship building . The gold miner , of ' 49 will probably be there , but he may have to content himself with a dark corner . To reach the present point has taken all of ten years of planning and wrangling , but in that time a lot of red tape has been unraveled and a final showdown between the various factions is near . Not that there are n't still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is settlement of the argument as to whether the fair is to be a county-wide project . with .. all communities giving their aid and blessing , or a localized show staged by one city . ' Long Beach , a waterfront city of 323.000. about 25 miles south of the Los Angeles downtown district , is farther along with its planning than the county-wide promoters . City Could Call Fair Harbor Work One big reason  --  the reason why such a small city can shoot so high  --  is money . Long Beach each year derives about $5 million from oil royalties , which legally can he used only for harbor development . The pro-fair faction in Long Beach thinks that by locating the fair in the harbor area a $10 million site can be provided " free " by dipping into the royalty funds . Whether such a move is legally possible has n't been tested yet . There have been reports of opposition to using earmarked revenue for such a purpose . Long Beach city officials , however , look with favor on a fair . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment of business which has branched from downtown Los Angeles . Pro-fair groups claim most of the opposition corners from the same sources that oppose a county-wide project . These center in the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce , which long has fought world fairs . Long Beach is going ahead as though it will have a fair whether or no . A World Fair Corp . has been formed as the necessary legal body to put ideas into action . From this corporation a " progress committee " soon is to emerge as the driving force for the project . Private funds also are to be raised in Long Beach to augment the harbor department 's " development money , " none of which has as yet been touched .. Hollywood Strong for Fair Efforts to make the fair a county-wide project are centered largely in Los Angeles , with Hollywood ( which is a part of Metropolitan Los Angeles ) sticking a large thumb in the pie . During the past year county-wide planners have been busy  --  and they think they 've made progress . Largely though lobbying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bills were voted : one designates 1950 as " Centennial World Fair Year . " The other makes it possible for county boards to appropriate funds for " promotion " of fairs throughout the state to celebrate 100 years of statehood . With that much accomplished , Los Angeles county supervisors heard a report from their World Fair Commission , appointed preciously to study feasibility of a world fair in the county . So favorable was this report that the supervisors voted to establish a County Centennial Authority , and appropriated $25. - 000 for its use during the fiscal year ending June 30. 1946 . No county money has been used in any fair - promotion up to now , however , because the supervisors as yet have n't signed the necessary contract with , the centennial authority . Funds thus far have come from private sources . Hollywood can hardly wait to get on the world fair bandwagon . Prominent Hollywoodians have been active on the supervisors ' commission and now are represented on the county centennial authorities . The movie people favor a county-wide fair as first choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with Long Beach if that does n't work out . Chamber of Commerce May Back Down Lately there have been signs that all parties may get together on a harmonious program . Fair promoters are cheered considerably by the fact that the Chamber of Commerce 's recently appointed committee actually has met once and has scheduled two or three more sessions . That 's more than any other previous chamber committee has done If the chamber changes its opposition , considerably more than half the battle will be won . the pro-fair groups believe . One other major hurdle has to be cleared . That 's competition with other cities . Detroit . Seattle , New Orleans and Washington , D. C .. all are thinking about a fair , and Washington already has approached Los Angeles promoters on a deal to avoid conflict in 1950 . There 's a clearing house  --  the Association of World Fairs  --  in Chicago to which bids are made for dates . Leaders here say it will soon he time for them to ask for southern California for 1949-50 . They also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Congress will he asked to recognize that Los Angeles ( or at least Long Beach ) is planning a world fair . Uncle Sam will be tapped for a building or two when the time looks ripe .
