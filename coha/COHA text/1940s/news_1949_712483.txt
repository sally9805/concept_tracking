txt Governor Dewey announced after a conference with Republican fiscal leaders of the Legislature today that his 1950-51 state budget might . be lower than the current record $986,000,000 budget and that there would be no new taxes . This year the Governor submitted to the Legislature a program calling for an increase of $162,500,000 in state taxes , but this was pared by $48,000,000 after a revolt led by Erie and Westchester County Republican members . It was accomplished by substituting bond monies for direct appropriations for grade crossing eliminations . That item need not recur in the next budget . The leader df the 1949 revolt , Senator Walter J. Mahoney of Buffalo , is now chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . He and Assemblyman D. Mallory Stephens , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , met today with the Governor and Budget Director John E. Burton . Mr. Dewey asserted that new taxes could be avoided , despite falling revenues in this fiscal year and necessary increased appropriations next year for welfare , education , housing and retirement . Agreement on Three Principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three principles as to their recommendations to the Legislature and in forming the new budget : ? " We will oppose any new taxes vigorously . We do , not feel that the unsettled business situation , particularly following the serious injuries the coal and steel strikes have done to our business , employment and wages , would warrant them . " Increased requirements ? under the law for state aid for pension systems , welfare and education must be studied with the greatest of care and the legal requirements as to all of them need study . The state is now obligated by law to // GOVERNOR OPPOSES MORE STATE TAXES // pay out very large sums in each of these categories , which are a very large majority of the budget . It seems an ever larger share of the state 's total revenue is paid out to the localities for local expenses . " It looks as though only 40 per cent of the new budget will be spent for the operation of state government and in its nineteen departments . Even this total may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual cost of operating the state , as distinguished from state aid , below last year 's cost . This means that departmental budgets will have to total less than last year 's and that the most stringent economies must be practiced . " The announcement of the fiscal policy to be followed by the Governor and Republican legislative leaders indicates that the Dewey administration is determined not to give the Democrats , who believe the outcome of last Tuesday 's election foreshadows election of a Democratic Governor next year , the issue of additional new taxes and a new high in state spending . 1949 Revenues Below Estimates The Governor said state revenues in this fiscal year would be between $25,000,000 and $30,000,000 below estimates , but he added : " The loss in state revenues presents a serious problem in balancing the budget , but I am determined to balance it without new taxes . " The drop in state revenues this year is due largely to the fact that small business has been hard hit , reducing state revenue from business taxes . The coal and steel strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession which began last year throughout the nation , on top of the coal and steel strikes , will cost us between $25 , - 000,000 and $30,000,000 in loss of revenue . " Mr. Dewey said that revenue from the state personal income tax had held up well and would approximate the $229,000,000 estimated in the 1949-50 executive budget . Budget Items Listed for Rise Welfare costs will be up during the next fiscal year , the Governor expects . In addition , the new budget will provide about $3,000 , - 1000 more in aid to education ; about $4,000,000 more for the state retirement fund , and about $3,000 , - 000 more in housing subsidies . Another item of $7,000,000 must be included to make up the least $143,000,000 will be spent for that purpose before the fiscal year ends . Although the combination of falling revenues and large increases in some appropriations would indicate a 1950-51 state budget substantially larger than the present $936,000,000 budget , together with higher taxes , the Governor said he intended to obviate the need for higher taxes by keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A number of obligations which the state now carries on , " he added , " will have to be subjected to careful scrutiny . " Budget hearings will start Wednesday , at which time department heads will submit their estimate of needs for the next fiscal year . They have been warned in advance that their requests will be reduced in many instances and that it will be a waste of time to submit requests for large increases .
