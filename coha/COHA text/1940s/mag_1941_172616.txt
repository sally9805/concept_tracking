Thirty thousand U.S. workmen , employed by the big Lockheed airplane factory at Burbank , Calif. , waited in the field beside the plant . In white shirts , bareheaded in the California noonday sun , they watched with the intent , quizzical , unfathomable expressions of U.S. workmen in a crowd . On the platform , Lord Halifax finished his brief speech of thanks to the men for the production of planes for Britain . <P> On the field the 1,000th Lockheed Hudson bomber built for Britain was warming up , ready to take the air , famed Pilot Jimmy Mattern at the controls . Lady Halifax said : " May I say to you and all the good workers of Lockheed . . . the people of Britain will welcome the arrival of yet another Hudson . . . . And now your labor takes wings . Go , Jimmy Mattern , and God bless you . " The plane streaked off for the Rockies , Canada , Britain and the war . Lord Halifax smiled ; Lady Halifax seemed close to tears . <P> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbs up and a deafening roar of welcome was astonishing to people who have a doctrinaire view of the U.S. and of U.S. workmen . Lord Halifax , a fox hunter and a gentleman , is aristocracy , and a good example of it . But to New Deal theoreticians , he is a specimen of a declining class . Ever since he arrived in Washington , New Dealers have buzzed with stories of U.S. labor 's animosity toward him . Even gentle Poet Carl Sandburg , who could hardly find a harsh word to say about Jeff Davis in his volumes on Lincoln , let fly with a blistering attack on Lord Halifax . <P> However the U.S. looked to the Ambassador 's aristocratic eyes , no flicker of resentment showed in them . Antagonistic newspapermen who baited him found themselves answered gravely and at length , could not swear that he knew he was being baited . <P> Last week it looked as if Lord Halifax had won his point , and was at last identified by the U.S. as an individual rather than as a symbol of Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , talked to 700 men building marine engines for sub chasers , to 1,500 shipyard workers , was cheered by both groups . In San Francisco police had to clear a path for him to the speaker 's table . He warned Japan that , while Britain had no desire to pick a quarrel , she would not let her interests in the Far East be set aside . He warned the U.S. that Hitler would soon make a specious peace offer , which Britain would reject ( " For sheer efficiency as a liar , Hitler stands alone in history . " ) . <P> Leaving a San Francisco hotel , the Ambassador was confronted by an elderly woman , dressed in black , carrying a large placard that read : " We remember 1776 and we will defend our Republic . " Lord Halifax asked her pleasantly , " You are against aiding England ? " <P> Said the picket : " I have nine sons . Seven of them are eligible for the draft , and some of them have been taken . I will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I will not give one of them to fight a war for another nation . " <P> Lord Halifax said : " I , too , have sons , three of them , fighting for England . " <P> " That 's your war . " <P> There was a pause . Lord Halifax said : " Wo n't you shake hands ? " They shook hands . <P> " I have no feeling against Britain , " said the old lady .
