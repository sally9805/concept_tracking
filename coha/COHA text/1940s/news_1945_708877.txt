txt Auto company sales executives have been burning the midnight oil in an effort to work out a fair method of allocating their first new models . They worry about the possibility of complaints of discrimination from their carhungry dealers . They do n't want the public to say that their cars are any easier to get in one town than In the next . How to avoid . accusations such as these has been the subject of continuing study for months . Most companies have now drawn up their main policy lines , but there are lots of troublesome details to be worked out . Companies with more dealer outlets than in 1941 have a tougher , allocation problem than those with less . They are unable , for instance , to use a dealer 's 1941 percentage of national sales as the yardstick for new car shipments , since provision has to be made for the dealers who have been added . All production controls on automobiles were lifted yesterday by the War Production Board . Story on page 2.3 To Use Pre-War Sales Records Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to use prewar sales records as the basis of their 1946 model allocations . Most , however , are going to make allowances for dealers who might be unfairly penalized by a rigid 1941 percentage of national sales formula . Packard has gone so far as to adopt what it calls an " open book policy " under ' which any dealer will be permitted to see the company 's record of shipments to other dealers . The idea is that any argument from Brooklyn or elsewhere to the effect that " we was robbed " will be quickly settled by a look at the book . Most auto makers , meanwhile ; will try to supply all dealers with their first car or two at as nearly as possible the same time . What becomes of the first model to arrive will be up to the , dealer unless the - Office of : Price **25;735;TOOLONG sales ' must be made immediately to the first buyer holding one of its priority certificates . Such certificates are not yet being issued and probably wo n't be for another month , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not required to sell his first car as soon as it arrives the smart thing for him to do , sales executives agree , will be to hold it for display purposes . Some have already advised their distributors and dealers of this viewpoint . Up-to-date figures on the total number of dealers in the United States are not available but a good guess would probably be about 35.000 . The total in October of last year was estimated by " Motor Age " at 32,150 compared with a December 1 , 1941 , figure of 41,790 . If all or most of these dealers decide to hold their first new models for display purposes It is unlikely that more than a handful of cars . other than Fords , will pass into the hands of users before November 1 . While production from there on will step up rapidly , a very small percentage of the would-be car buyers will have satisfied their craving for a new model by the year-end . Allocation plans of the individual companies at present shape up as follows : FORD  --  As first off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cars to selected storage points throughout the country . When enough have been built to accomplish what is termed " a fair representation " they will be passed out to dealers in the surrounding areas . After that , past performance will be used to determine the percentage of the company 's car production that will go to each dealer . Sales records of 1941 and prior years will be considered and adjustments will be made for population shifts . The availability of shipping facilities into various areas will also be a facto at first . With approximately the same number of dealers as in 1941 , the new ones will in most cases be treated as replacements , with their predecessors ' records the main guide in car allocations . Allowance , however , will be made for changes in selling area limits and for other factors influencing the dealer 's " sales potential . " NASII  --  As I the second manufacturer to release pictures of its 1946 model , Nash is planning a " national announcement day " after each dealer has been supplied with one new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cars at exactly the same time , but the plan is for the dealers to delay their display until the announcement day . Sales potential of each dealer 's area has undergone a substantial overhauling as to personnel and selling areas , its allocation of cars will be based less on past . performance than on the sales potential in each dealer 's area . Dealer contracts have been drawn on the basis of estimated annual sales . When volume production is reached , car allotments will be in proportion to the contract figures . HUDSON  --  Allocation plane of Hudson have not yet been fully revealed but its sales manager has stated . that the new cars will be distributed on " a percentage basis " to distributors and dealers after a thorough analysis of the territory and consultation with the retailer . Because the number of its distributors and dealers has been greatly expanded , past performance has apparently been discarded as a guide to car allocation . The first Hudson cars have been promised before the end of August by A. E. Barit , president . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will require several weeks to ship and display these cars . " GENERAL MOTORS ? Underlying policy for General Motors divisions was set forth by Alfred P. Sloan , Jr. , in a message to dealers on May 2 , 1942 . It read as follows : " For a period of two years after productionis resumed , from the cars available for domestic distribution , General Motors will extend priority in car shipments to dealers whose active service has been continuous during the period of suspended production , before making cars available for new dealers on the following basis : " After setting aside a reserve of 15% of the resumed production available , to satisfy changed conditions of demand , such dealers may purchase from their divisions the same annual percentage of the resumed car production as they did during the model year 1941 , plus a bonus of 40% of such percentage , subject to the availability of cars . " In ' practice , some slight deviations from this policy will necessarily be made . These , in most instances . result from verbal understandings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A successful Michigan Buick dealer , for example , who sold his business to enter the air forces , was given a dealership on the outskirts of St. Louis on his discharge and has been assured of a reasonable quota of cars . The dealer who replaced him in Michigan , meanwhile , is to be allotted cars In accordance with his predecessor 's sales record . Because relatively few dealers were lost by General Motors divisions during the war , the bonus to be added to the 1941 sales percentage figures of those who stayed in business will not be large . To equalize the timing of the arrival of new cars as much as possible , the general plan is to ship to distant areas first and to nearby dealers later . No General Motors divisions , however , have announced plans for a simultaneous display by all dealers . The Oldsmobile division . in fact , has already exhibited its first models to the public in Lansing , Detroit and New York . CHRYSLER ? Final allocation plans of this company are understood to be awaiting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time and of who will be allowed to buy the first ones . Initial shipments will go to distant points in line with past practice when new models have been introduced . In the company 's Chrysler division , a realignment of dealers ' territories is stated to have taken place . In a recent message to dealers . the president of this division declared that " quotas will be based on the potential of the territories and the man who can move 10 cars will get his allotment as surely as the man who can , sell 1,000 . " PACKARD  --  Allocation of cars by Packard will be based mainly on each dealer 's sales record in 1940 and 1941 , with a reserve of about 10% held out to supply dealers who have been added to the selling organization since then . Allotments to the latter will be guided by pre-war sales in their territories of cars in the Packard price range .

GRAHAM-PAIGE -- Plans for distributing this company 's cars through the new KaiserFrazer Corp . dealer organization have not yet been drawn up . Sinceothere is no past performance record to serve as a guide to car allocations , the present intention is to supply dealers in proportion to pre-war sales of comparably priced cars in their territories .
