THE Marshall Plan , now creeping slowly for lack of grain , will be stopped cold this year for lack of steel . While the politicians can temporarily get some people to eat less and get everybody to pay the same price for a smaller loaf of bread to launch the Marshall Plan , they ca n't do that with steel . Workers wo n't vote themselves into unemployment and industrialists wo n't vote their companies into the red by shipping the steel abroad that they need at home to provide jobs and profits . An Emergency Food Committee can appeal to Americans ' inherent humanity in 1947 , but an Emergency Steel Committee in 1948 would only draw " boo 's " from the nation 's workers and a sitdown strike from the industrialists . And the politicians would support both ? witness their present outcry against exporting steel pipe that their farmer and oil company constituents are short of because there is not enough steel capacity in America or the world . This persistent steel shortage has the Big Names of the large steel producers dizzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the steel shortage in six months , only to find it persisting at the end of each six-month period since V-J Day . Now they give the steel shortage two more years of life . Is their new prediction any more trustworthy than their previously discredited ones ? General George C. Marshall saw his military plans delayed at the war 's start for lack of steel . Is he also going to see his peace plans delayed for lack of steel ? I say that he will . The American Iron and Steel Institute and its Big Names from its big company members say , " No . " Which counsel should the General and America heed ? But , you may ask , is n't the whole controversy about the adequacy of steel capacity settled anyway by the industry 's announcement of a billion dollar expansion program ? Unfortunately not , because , as I shall reveal later , this announcement carried in newspaper ads is a phony . AT TIMES like these the record is always a valuable thing to examine . These prognosticators of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the same men who " out of forty years of personal , practical experience in the steel industry " predicted that there was enough steel in 1941 to fight the war ; who contended during the war that the new steel capacity under construction would not be finished in time to help win the war ; and who prognosticated that building steel capacity to over ninety million tons a year would result in ever so many idle steel plants in the postwar era . I shudder to ponder where our economy and the world would be today if we did not have the ten  | million tons of pig iron and fourteen million tons of steel capacity that were built during the war . Why have these men of such great practical experience in steel been so wrong on steel capacity ? Old Andrew Carnegie could tell them . One has to know more than the steel industry to know whether and when there is enough steel . This is a basic question of worldwide economics and international relations . The present steel crowd lack the insight of their greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are quick to point out how little old Andy knew about steel , and his knowledge of steel was limited . But his success grew out of his profound knowledge of the relationship of the iron and steel industry to the economy as a whole and to the world . It is here that the current-day leaders of steel are demonstrating their abysmal ignorance in public , and have been doing so since their Gano Dunn reports of early 1940 ( which discounted the need for additional steel capacity ) ? reports so obviously shortsighted that even an insignificant research director of a steel labor union knew they were dead wrong , and said so . Two personal experiences are revealing . After I had had the benefit of a year as a top official of the steel division of the War Production Board , I freely said that the postwar world would use all of our steel capacity ( so greatly expanded during the war ) and still cry for more . The president of one of the largest steel producers warned me that I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replied , " Yes , but if I 'm right , look how much more silly you are going to look . " " Not a chance , boy , not a chance , " laughed this man , who said steel would be lucky to run at seventy per cent of capacity after V -J Day . After I became vice-president of one of the country 's integrated steel producers , I spent an afternoon in this president 's office . " How do you like the steel business , Harold ? " said he . " Fine , just fine , " I replied , " but what happened to your seventy per cent fore-cast ? " " I was right about steel , but I did n't fully take into account all the outside factors , " he answered . This steel firm head is beginning to understand what was old Andy 's chief stock in trade . Experience number two . The War Production Board steel division is trying to perpetuate itself , and so far has succeeded . At its second annual reunion in Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my WPB associates including two of its former directors who are steel company presidents . With us was an ex-college professor turned personnel man . He was talking about broader steel items than prices , the demand for stainless , and rails . " What we need , and nobody has yet done , " said he , " is a definitive statement of our industrial culture . . . " " What 's that ? " he was rudely interrupted . And another brilliant mind chirped , " How much does it sell for a ton ? " I did not join the belly-laughs , but looked at each tormentor of the exprofessor . To smooth over the wisecracks , a steel man of " forty years ' experience asked , " What do you mean by industrial culture ? " The tormented man went on and he sounded a little like Lewis Mumford , whose Technics and Civilization ought to be required reading before anyone is allowed to learn about steel metallurgy . " Very interesting . I never heard it called Industrial Culture before , " replied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years before , old Andy had given speeches and written articles and books about ( and even given money for ) things that had to do with a Culture that was being radically changed by the industries that these how-much-a-ton fellows manage . THE mere fact that a man has " forty years of practical steel experience " behind him does not qualify him as the supreme judge of the adequacy of his industry 's capacity . These men whose foreheads are wrinkled with years of steel experience were wrong in 1941 not because they did n't know steel , but because they lacked the imagination to envision the insatiable appetite for steel of a total war . Yet an historical knowledge of what the Civil War did for our then struggling iron industry ; of how the Spanish-Ameri- can War brought our budding steel industry to maturity ; and of how short we were of steel in World War I led me to the obvious conclusion that there was not enough iron and steel capacity to wage a new world war that was to make a rehearsal of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity was inadequate , and campaigned through the CIO and the Truman Committee to expand it before Pearl Harbor . Steel and iron facilities were not only expanded during the war , but enough of them were completed to help win the war . I urge General Marshall , whose military plans were delayed by the well-meaning but shortsighted leaders of the steel industry , not to be misled again by the same type of best-intentioned shortsightedness . There is just not enough steel capacity to carry through the General 's peace plans and also operate our own economy adequately . I WOULD LIKE to ask my fellow steel executives how many automobiles , tractors , and tin cans our economy would be producing today if our steel industry were without the iron and steel facilities built during the war . And also whether we would have over sixty million jobs today if we could produce only seventy-five million tons of steel ingots instead of the present eighty-five million tons ? The Sixty Million Job debate just before war 's end sheds light on the current steel capacity debate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) unless the government did so and so plus several other things ( 2 ) sixty million jobs could not be created in the postwar years . The opponents said that ( 1 ) no matter what is done by government or anybody else ( 2 ) sixty million jobs were a pipe dream and could not be achieved in the immediate postwar years . Both were wrong . The program of action so essential to get sixty million jobs was not adopted , yet the sixty million jobs that could not be furnished are with us today . Why ? I do n't pretend to know ( for sure ) , but I suspect that the answer lies in the same factors that are causing the enduring postwar steel shortage which has every promise of persisting . When I was in Washington I had access to reports and people who knew what was happening to the steel industry in other countries . They were unanimous : while the United States produced 43 per cent of the world 's steel in 1940 , afte=r the war she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This , combined with a little historical look at our own economy , led me to the forthright conclusion that after the war the steel industry would be in for a boom that would make the industry 's heads dizzy . And they have been seen to appear dizzy in recent months . I recently heard one of the more publicized large steel company heads ask , " But what will we do with the new capacity two years from now ? " I remember hearing him ask during the war , " What will we do with all this new capacity after the war is over ? " II BRIEF historical look at our domestic economy reveals that it has been starved for steel for almost two decades . In the thirties the railroads did n't rebuild and the people did n't buy the cars they could have operated if they had had the income to buy them . The economy was depressed . In the farmer 's case , there was underconsumption of steel going back ten more years as their depression , we all know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the depression in the early forties and industry began to recuperate at the same time , along came the war that kept them from buying the steel they then had the money to buy . I recall the plaintive plea of a steelworker : " In the thirties I did n't have the money to buy a car ; now in the war I have the money but I ca n't buy a car . " I wonder if he is among the millions still waiting for his car to be delivered two years after the war 's end . What comfort does he get when he hears Henry Ford II say , " The steel industry does not have the capacity to make all the steel that many of us desperately need and want " ? How does he feel when he hears his SOHIO broadcaster say that there will be a petroleum shortage because there is not enough steel pipe for transmission lines ? Will his coldness or pocketbook be relieved any this winter when he will be  | idle or shy of dividend checks because manufacturing plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inadequate pipelines that could not be enlarged for lack of steel pipe ? An industry trade journal reports , " Almost six million tons of steel is needed in the next few years to make the 27,220 miles of pipelines which are to be built . " Farm fence is even a more revealing example . In 1947 the steel industry shipped over 350,000 tons of fence to keep cattle , hogs , and chickens penned in before marketing . And the demand is getting farther and farther ahead of supply , because the farmers are fencing in the fields they could n't afford to fence during the twenties and thirties and could n't get the fence for during the war . Furthermore , as farming becomes more specialized , fields within fields are being fenced . It will be well into the fifties before the farmers ' demand for fence drops to the level of supply . Idle automobile plants ? for lack of steel ? are daily headlines , and these will persist . General Motors ' head sees automobile demand holding at capacity for several years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone filling the gap caused by four years of no automobile output . And I believe that America will be able to support ten million more vehicles on the road in 1950 than it had in 1940 . There is just not enough steel capacity to fill such domestic needs . The conclusion is overwhelming : When you combine ( 1 ) a big industrial nation like ours that has been starved for steel for almost twenty years , with ( 2 ) a world whose steel industry has been decimated by a war , which ( 3 ) created an unprecedented postwar need for steel , a steel boom and shortage seems inevitable for the only country that suffered no physical damage in history 's most destructive war . BUT where 's the money coming from ? Who is going to pay the bill for all these exports ? " is the present plea of those practical industrialists who said their combined industries could not give jobs to sixty million gainfully employed . General Marshall has already answered this question . In the forepart of 1947 our exports were running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a half a billion . This is a $750 million monthly deficit , and herein lies a basic contributing factor to America 's current prosperity . Cut exports down to the level of imports , and there may be enough steel in due time , but there wo n't be sixty million jobs . A steel surplus can be created quickly by severing America from the world , but America can no more live so severed than an amputated arm . The domestic economy is being primed ( yes , this is pump-priming ) at the annual rate of nine billion dollars ? far more than the great F.D.R. ever dared do . And General Marshall has made it clear why America has no other defensible alternative . Steel is making around 85 million tons of ingots this year , which is about all its present facilities will do despite their theoretical capacity of a little over 91 million tons . More than ten per cent is being exported as steel products , and half again as much in the form of cars , trucks , tractors , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over twelve million tons of steel ingots a year ? one whale of a lot of steel is being exported directly and in fabricated form even before the Marshall Plan is started . And these exports can no more be stopped than can the exporting of wheat . Like it or not , the United States is the hub of one of the two worlds on our planet today , and she is going to have to keep her world going with steel and wheat and dollars and a lot of other things . LAST April 1 said in the pages of Life magazine that the United States @# can not meet domestic and world steel needs with 91 million tons of capacity and called for " a steel industry that can produce 100 million ingot tons of steel a year . . . now , not in 1950 or 1955 . " I also advanced the idea that higher steel prices would make it profitable enough for the industry to finance this expansion out of its profit-dollar after taxes . But U. S. Steel , the price leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases , let alone enhance profits , and the public seems to approve high profits for other in- dustries but feels that somehow steel profits are sinful . This is a dangerous attitude for a people who are living in the Steel Age . Charley White , the lanky , tireless heir to Tom Girdler , in opposing steel expansion argues that new facilities cost so much today that the steel produced in them would have to sell for twenty dollars a ton ? a cent a pound ? above present levels . Instead of being a reason for not expanding steel capacity , this is a good reason for raising both steel prices and steel capacity . Are steel profits too high ? Look at U. S. Steel . In 1937 , no excessive profit year , U. S. Steel netted $95 million , since when the value of the industrial dollar has dropped at least forty per cent . To earn the same profits in 1937 dollars would take $158 million in 1947 . U. S. Steel netted around $130 million last year . A cent-a-pound increase in steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional tons of capacity , and ? with Phil Murray 's CIO Steelworkers Union hot in pursuit of a just share of corporate earnings ? will not unduly raise steel profits . The Big Names in my industry publicly disputed my pleas for steel expansion last spring , and my steel friends said I would be the laughingstock of the industry by Christmas . Now that Christmas 1947 has come and gone , the end of the steel shortage has been postponed not for another six months but for all of two years . And in 1949 it will be postponed still again ? unless there is a cyclical recession . It will take a real depression to bail the Big Names ' prediction of sufficient steel capacity out of the bucket . My steel friends did not laugh at me this Christmas , and by the coming Christmas they will be in the throes ? for better or for worse ? of another great iron and steel expansion . III BUT are they not already expanding steel capacity by one billion dollars ? This belated expansion announcement is a phony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for only two and one-half million tons of ingot capacity , while four and one-half million tons of capacity have been abandoned since V -J Day . By far the largest part of the billion dollars is for finishing mills , not the much- needed raw steel and iron producing facilities . The big sheet producers are greatly expanding cold rolled sheet mills , whose product is more profitable than hot rolled sheets . Most of the steel for these new cold rolled mills will come from hot rolled sheets . This will give the country more cold rolled sheets , but it wo n't provide any more steel over-all ? just a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul . When this billion-dollar expansion program is completed the industry will be lucky to be able to make ninety million tons of ingots a year . The domestic and world need is clearly for a hundredmillion-ingot-ton American steel industry . Lastly , virtually all of this billion dollar program was under way last spring when the American Iron and Steel Institute was using its annual spring reunion as a sounding board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that are short of steel , that our steel capacity is adequate . A few weeks later , on June 19 , 1947 , Wilfred Sykes , President of Inland Steel , the official Institute spokesman , told a Senate Committee , " I believe we are going to have real relief from the steel shortage by the end of this year . " The next scene was in mid-September before the same Senate Committee . Then Mr. Sykes and his fellow big steel company presidents gave the steel shortage two more years of life . Whereupon the case for expanding steel capacity , underlined by the Marshall Plan , could no longer be denied . That is when the Institute announced the billion dollar expansion program , and backed it up with paid advertisements . The program is a phony because ( 1 ) it is largely devoted to rounding out finishing facilities ; ( 2 ) when complete it will still leave us close to ten million tons below the needed annual capacity of 100 million ingot tons ; and ( 3 ) it was all under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . True , the industry is spending a billion dollars , but it is primarily to round out its finishing facilities and not to expand its basic capacity . It is the latter that is so urgently needed , and I have a practical suggestion to get  | this steel capacity debate off dead center and to start to build more blast furnaces , steel works , and the necessary raw material facilities behind them . Before getting into this suggestion , however , there is one alibi and one dumdum argument against expansion to be waylaid . The alibi : if it were not for the 18 million tons of ingots lost in the past two years because of strikes there would be few complaints about the steel shortage now . As long as the leaders of the American Iron and Steel Institute contended that the steel shortage would be over in six months , this point had some weight . But now that they give the shortage two more years to run , it loses its force . Eighteen million ingot tons is ten weeks ' production , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the end of the steel famine . Too bad that we lost this tonnage , but its loss is hardly reason sufficient to claim that the steel shortage would now be over if we had not lost the 18 million tons ( incidentally , an exaggerated figure ) . During the war the last straw which the anti-steel-expansionists grabbed ran something like this : it takes one ton of steel to build four tons of capacity , and since the new capacity wo n't come in for 18 to 24 months this one ton should not be diverted from tanks and guns . I was one who had to contend with this argument during the war , and it did stop some expansion and delay most of the rest . The facts are accurate . Current steel consumption has to be sacrificed to get more steel tomorrow . In the war we wisely decided to slow down the armament program to get more steel later , and it paid off . Whether this should be done again in the current situation is clearly a matter of judgment . Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any steel sacrificed today to get more steel tomorrow will pay off in large dividends to our domestic economy and foreign policy . IV IF OLD Andy Carnegie were living today , he would go ahead and build a half dozen more blast furnaces and a score more open hearths , and he would make another fortune selling the products of these furnaces . But he would have to contend with taxes that did not hinder him in the last third of the past century . And these federal taxes are a real hindrance . So I have a practical proposal to make Uncle Sam should give some assistance to us poor steel producers to help finance the expansion of iron and steel facilities . Out of every dollar in profit we make today . we have to pay Uncle Sam thirty-eight cents . It costs millions to build iron- and steel-making furnaces , and especially now these facilities are costly to erect . Any money we spend on them must be capitalized , which means that Uncle Sam leaves us only sixty-two cents of each profit dollar for such purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full profit dollar to finance expansion , and not just sixtytwo cents of it . Here is how the proposal would work . It should apply only to primary expansion , such as coke plants , iron ore and coal mines , blast furnaces that make pig iron , converters and open hearths that make steel , soaking pits that preheat steel for rolling , and basic rolling mills such as blooming , slabbing , and billet mills . These are the new facilities that cost so much and without which finishing facilities are of little value . The cost of all primary facilities enumerated above should be treated the same as operating expenses , but the cost of finishing facilities should be treated as capital expenditures , as is the present practice . This proposal should be effective with all primary expansions begun since V-J Day and continue for all others undertaken within six months after Uncle Sam gives the " go sign . " I specifically exclude finishing facilities , for which most of the billion dollars is going , because they increase a company 's earning power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 million tons of ingots a year . The industry is already expanding these facilities still more . The trouble is that they are not being backed up with the necessary raw iron and steel . At the Portsmouth Steel Corporation we are spending around two million dollars on new finishing facilities to increase our earning position . The other companies are doing likewise , especially with cold rolled sheet and strip mills . But we at Portsmouth  | hesitate to build another blast furnace which we could use , and to a large extent this is true of the other steel producers . A major reason is the high cost of new facilities , which can be overcome by Uncle Sam letting us write them off fast . Beware of the proposal to accelerate the depreciation of existing facilities as this would freeze out the new fellow . Only newly built facilities should receive accelerated depreciation treatment by the federal tax people . It may be sounder to finance basic primary iron and steel facilities out of new investment money . Some of it will be done that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue for coke- and iron-making facilities . But this is the exception . Uncle Sam needs to step into the breach and provide an incentive to expand these costly primary facilities . I say that a new three-year amortization plan will end the steel capacity debate and lay the foundations for a **25;581;TOOLONG steel industry by 1949-50 . Tom Girdler may doubt that there will be a need for this increased capacity in two years , but he was wrong about the new capacity built during the war , and he can be wrong again . Up to mid-September the , American Iron and Steel Institute stoutly rejected all thought of expansion . Then , as I have shown , it announced that a few companies were expanding basic steel facilities to the extent of two and one-half million ingot tons . This public reversal would seem to indicate that some of its leaders are getting mixed emotions about expanding . But they are full of fears : first , that new facilities cost too much ; second , that there may be no demand for the steel once the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam to give the steel industry some tax encouragement , and tip the scales in favor of making America a hundredmillion-ton steel country by 1950.  |
