THE FORTUNE OF ETERNITY - Percy Bysshe Shelley - William-Frederick Press ( $2.50 ) . <P> THE SHELLEY LEGEND-Robert Metcalfe Smith &; Others-Scribners ( $5 ) . <P> <P> Percy Bysshe Shelley has been beckoning from the abode where the Eternal are . His signals , picked up by a literary Ariel who signs herself : " Shirley Carson Jenney , Clairaudient Psychic , " are transcribed in The Fortune of Eternity . The book , she says , ' ' has been transmitted wholly thro ' clairaudient dictation . " <P> Author Jenney gives all credit for her 124-page collaboration to Poet Shelley , who has also supplied the foreword ( " Whenever I have tried to compass the thought of mankind as possessing relevance to the eternal spheres , it has become clearly evident to me that the Earthman was choiring his way . . . . The prisms of chance do not allow too great an opportunity for merit or renown ; they revoke the essential , and persuade mankind into linear aspects such as the ulterior powers descry for illusive dedications . " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladstone , disembodied but still magisterial in the beyond . <P> The book includes two prose pieces . <P> One is The Script of Christ , which for some reason seems to have been dictated in the inspirational style of the late Aimee Semple McPherson . In the other , the book 's title piece , Shelley proclaims the news that " GOD IS . " There is also a sort of undertaker 's garland of poems written since Shelley " passed over . " Many of them , like From the Death of the Skylark , are unfortunately fragments . Sample : <P> Where the lofty splendors Linger o'er thy nest , And the passioning grandeurs Know some ritual blest Thy magic hours seek altars , which are to God behest ! <P> Dome of Many Colored Glass . These ghostly skylarkings merely carry to the point of caricature the lovingly-labored transformation of Shelley from flaming infidel to versifying vicar at which Author Smith &; Others* tilt grimly in The Shelley Legend . The " Shelley Legend , " they say , " is a term used to characterize fallacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown up principally under the careful supervision first of Mary Shelley Shelley 's second wife , and after her death , in 1851 , of Lady Shelley , wife of the poet 's son , Sir Percy Florence Shelley . " The authors ' sensational charge : in building their dome of many-colored glass in which to enshrine Shelley as a plaster saint , Mary and Lady Shelley falsified biographical facts , suppressed and destroyed important letters and parts of journals and made liberal use of forged documents . <P> Chirographical Gumshoe . To clinch their point , the unromantic authors enlisted Louis A. Waters , a chirographical gumshoe , whose workaday job is special consultant in forgery cases for the New York state police . Says Author Smith : Chirpgrapher Waters " is not a Shelley specialist and has nothing about Shelley to prove other than that some manuscripts are in Shelley 's hand and others are not . " Expert Waters ' findings : libraries and collectors are cherishing more forged Shelley documents than genuine ones ; many of the Shelley family 's documents are forged .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
