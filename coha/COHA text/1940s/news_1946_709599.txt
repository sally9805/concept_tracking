txt WASHINGTON , June 26 ? The minimum wage increase bill , a top item on President Truman 's major program for the Congress now pressing toward adjournment , was sidetracked and apparently blocked finally by the House Committee on Rules today . A similar fate seemed to confront the President 's own emergency strike control bill , to the enactment of which the same committee holds the key . To expedite House action on the wage measure the Committee on Labor had brushed aside the bill approved by the Senate in April after a three-week fight and reported out its own version , stripped down to a simple raising of the present legal pay minimum of 40 cents an hour to 65 cents , the figure adopted by the Senate . No attempt was made , as with the Senate bill , to broaden the coverage of the wage-hour law or to raise other controversial issues . Through the acting chairman , Representative Jennings Randolph of West Virginia , a majority of the Labor Committee urged the Rules Committee to release this bill for floor action and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the picture the fact that the Sena  --  e twice defying a veto threat by President Truman , wrote into its minimum wage bill the Pace parity price-raising amendment which Government economists declared would add slime $4,500,000,000 to - the annual food budget of the country . Representative George E. Outland of California , speaking as the head of the informal steering committee on proposed labor legisla // nun PAY BILL STALLED IN HOUSE // tion , informed the committee that the President had told him he would veto a House bill if it contained the Pace amendment . Representative Stephen Pace of Georgia , author of the proposal to include ' farm labor cost increases ( amounting , he said , to 300 to 400 per cent of such costs during the 1909-14 parity base period ) in the computation of parity prices , asked for a rule which would admit his amendment for consideration . He recalled that the House had once adopted it , as a separate bill , by a unanimous vote and a second time with only one vote against it . He said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated a willingness to open the way for the Pace amendment through debate which favored a treatment of farm commodity , prices-similar to those in industry which have been elevated to cover wage rises gained through strikes . Mr. Pace said he had noted a new " restlessness " among farmers , spoke of the recent farm " strike " in Ohio and predicted that " a John L. Lewis , a Philip Murray or a William Green might rise among the farmers and organize them to fighting strength . " Wage-Price Spiral a Factor Witnesses and committee members discussed the upward spiral of wages and prices , and predicted more of it . " If we are being pressed to the higher level , " said Representative Charles A. Halleck , Republican . of Indiana , " we might as well reach it with those who are feeding the world being given a chance to cover their increased labor costs along with industry . " In the Rules Committee , mem ) 3ers were divided . Those who openly wanted it to pass realized that it was headed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pace amendment and with doubt , on the Senate side , that a veto ' would be overridden . Advocates of the Pace amendment , on the other hand , seemed to agree that if a veto should be overridden , the increased food costs resulting from the amendment would nullify the increased minimum wage . After the executive session , during which the committee promptly adopted rules to release four other measures for floor action , it was announced that the Wage bill was laid over " pending further consideration . " Representative Adolph J. Sabath , chairman , said this action was taken because Representative Eugene E. Cox of Georgia , wanted to be present and he had left Washington for the Georgia primary campaign and election to be held July 17 . The date for the adjournment of the Seventy-ninth Congress sine die has been set tentatively between July 17 and July 21 . Asked whether he thought there was any chance for Rules Committee action on the Wage bill before the Congress went home to stay , Mr. Sabath said : " I 'm afraid not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided tentatively to abandon President Truman 's recommendation for a joint Congressional committee investigation into the underlying causes of labor-management disputes , with later proposals for legislative remedies . Instead , the committee suggested that such an inquiry might be conducted by a Presidential Commission , with a report of findings being made to Congress by March . Senator James E. Murray of Montana , committee chairman , directed legislative counsel to draft a resolution along these lines , and called the committee to meet Monday for a decision . With the fate . of . the Hobbs " anti-racketeering " bill still in the hands of President Truman , the Chamber of Commerce of the United States , through William J. Jackson , president , today urged the Chief Executive to sign it . Mr. Jackson referred to the I President 's " fear , " voiced in his veto of the Case bill , that the pen-1 alties might run " against those who strike and picket peacefully or take other legitimate and peaceful concerted action , " and added : " It seems to us that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make it abundantly evident that punitive action could not be taken against the peaceful activities of labor unions .
