" Whatever happens at Orel happens just as much everywhere in Germany at the same time . . . . Orel has already be come a symbol of internal strength , a symbol in which one will always see a test of German soldiers far beyond all successes achieved hitherto . " <P> When these words were published in the German press five weeks ago , the long-awaited , ill-fated German summer offensive of 1943 had not yet spent its strength . Last week , after a relentless , inch-by-inch , 24-day counterdrive , the powerful Red Army seized Orel and drove on . For nearly two years Orel had been a key bastion of Hitler 's forces in Russia . Now the Wehrmacht 's high command issued a terse communiqu : " In the course of a shortening of the front in the Orel bend , the evacuation of the city of Orel , which had been planned for quite some time was carried out , undisturbed by the enemy . . . . " <P> As Orel cracked and crumbled , there was a thunderous echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an other huge Soviet force emerged in a swift and surprise smash at Belgorod . Within a single day that key to the lush grainfields of the Ukraine and the rich industrial Donets basin fell , too , and the Red Army crushed on . <P> It was Joseph Stalin 's turn to speak . As all Russia rejoiced over the unprecedented double victory , the Marshal addressed a special order of the day to Generals Popov , Sokolovsky , Rokossovsky , Vatutin and Konev : " The legend of the Germans that Soviet troops are allegedly unable to wage a successful offensive in the summertime has been dispelled . . . . Death to the German invaders ! " <P> Intoxicated with joy , the citizens of Moscow lapsed into a holiday mood for the first time since the war began . The Red capital reverberated to twelve volleys . of artillery from 120 guns , a six-minute salute to the troops who won the twin victories . <P> Two Offensives . Pursuing the same strategy that carried them from Stalingrad to Kharkov last winter , the Russians had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then had launched a mighty counterattack . This quickly developed into a two-pronged offensive-actually two offensives - along a 300-mile front . One prong jabbed hard at the heels of the Germans routed at Orel , liberated hundreds of Russian villages and advanced toward Bryansk . Farther to the north , other Russian forces stabbed southwest from Vyazma toward the main Nazi base at Smolensk . <P> From Belgorod the second prong , led by tanks and motorized columns , slashed southwestward to push swiftly across the flat steppes northwest of Kharkov . The speed was so great in some sectors that the Germans abandoned much heavy equipment in the flight . Some mobile units raced to within 16 miles of Kharkov , one encircled several Nazi garrisons . A powerful secondary drive starting from Chuguev , 25 miles southeast of Kharkov , threatened a new pincers squeeze on the Ukrainian stronghold . <P> All along the front the massed strength of the Red Air Force proved a heavy factor in blasting paths through the German defenses . At Kharkov and Bryansk , the Russians reported , many German trains were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started .
