IN THE END , I WILL KNOW YOU ... A Stog ANN CHIDESTER U NDER my breath , I said : " Ah , Parnell , stop spitting in the face of God and get down off that stepladder before I clout you a good one over the head with my yardstick , being as it 's the only thing handy at present . " But there he stands all foggy and big and dumb and black as the creatures under the ground , like a useless hoe , you might say , blinking his eyes and standing on the ladder just the same . Every time he does that , my heart in my throat fears he 'll fall and bust himself wide open . Every time , nary a fall , but let it be me or one of the others that can make for ourselves and be witty and all , and we 'd fall and be down in bed a month at least . But not Parnell . Look at him stand there blinking in infinity , wearing those old stinking overalls , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is breaking with the great happiness of doing something , and there is a fierce heart in him to do something and to love and to be loved , like a St. Bernard , we always say . Now it is the storm windows , but tomorrow it will be a rain pipe or a tree to be doctored and the next day , God knows , but it 's something else to lay a strong , gentle hand to . That Parnell . " Mother , " I said down the air vent , " Parnell is standing on the ladder looking in the window like a giddy owl . " " Oh , is it ! " she said . I went back to the sewing table and knew the black hawk face was there behind me in the wind and I knew all that face , the quivering lips and dark eyes that looked out , always looked out without telling . Then I heard Mother go outside and stand in the orchard and call up to him . Thud , thud , thud was the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then there was a scraping sound as he moved the ladder against the house . And after that , he was at the window that was at the far end of the sewing room . My cousin Parnell , that has gimlicks in his head . Gimlicks we used to call it when we were children and Parnell sat like a great animal , thin with the thinness that is not of the body and with light inside him and coming through his weathered skin , and he sat there in the orchard leaning against the strongest tree and looking into the sky . " Burds , " he would say . Ah , but then we realized that he knew the seasons and so knew it was spring . And later , there he was looking at the " burds " when the rest of us had gone off to Chicago or New Orleans and forgotten them . You do not know why people like that are brought from the earth and given breath and the look of sanity , but then when you have lived with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , I swear , the darkest thing a child can see and know about and feel kinship . And then , the facet of such a diamond is terrible in its beauty . To see him move so slowly there , picking up the storm windows and bringing them up the ladder , breathing hard through his mouth , the lankness of his black hair over his eyes . I swear there is a Reason , and this Reason is beautiful and dark . The Reason is not Sin as the priest used to say . He came in the afternoons in an old Essex touring car . Mostly it was Fridays , and he came to have tea with my mother and my aunts . The men stayed out in the wide field or in the barn and would not come , but spat in the grass or in the hay and talked hard and believed in the Reality . But in the parlor my mother and the aunts moved through the dream that was holy , the dream that saved them , and Parnell sat there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shudder . The priest would speak out with it as if it were nothing to say , as if there were no hurt to it , and Parnell was sitting on the floor with his big boots scrappy with mud and listening all the while with his thudding animal heart , and the priest would say it . ( Lord , I wish I would not think of a thing like that when it is past because it turns me against Them , the saints I mean and the Holy Mother and Everyone and even the One , Himself . ) But the priest said : " God takes care of the dumb ones like our Parnells . Someone has sinned greatly and he is here to remind us of this sin , and no one will sin again when they look at such . " They had called him Parnell , and it was never a joke and never will be in their mouths . They were so proud of the one that went down in infamy , the one that was King of Ireland and Prince of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Parnell O'Connor it was without mirth but with gravity , though it was not truly a saint 's name but only of him who could have been Saint if they had not trampled on his image . That first Parnell was a dream the fierce people had , and now this one named for him is another dream who moves within still another dream . I see him move in the cold , autumnal afternoon sun , washing the windows with a bit of a sponge and bringing them up the rickety ladder , and he is in a dream of no understanding , and I , by choice , would move in such a bitter dream . O NCE , with great , spouting rationalizing , they had to take him away from here , and when they brought him back it was never the same , for once you take them away they are never the same , no matter . The lovely thing , whatever it is , goes from them a little now and then , and they know fear . I swear , before this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parnell or anything he did . What he did , he did from inside himself , with cunning , moving in his wonderful dream all the time  --  but never with fear before this time . I was about ten when they took him away . I was the one in a Girl Scout uniform that hung below my knees , and that was the summer I had a snotty nose from June till September and was whooping around the house day in and day out , with only Parnell there to listen to me and nod his head without saying to go outside and blow it or go to the bedroom and blow it or for Lord 's sake have pity and shut up now . They took him away in the new blue Dodge car that had a radio . It was the first one to have a radio , and they put him in there one Sunday afternoon . Sunday it was , because it was so long and sleepy  --  yes , it was Sunday , I know . We rode down to the state hospital with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head from side to side with delight . Once , going by a field , there was a blue and yellow plane , and it came down very low in the sunlight , and Parnell sobbed . It was one big sob , and he sucked in his breath and his wide chest heaved and he followed the plane with his eyes until it was nothing more than a tiny bug in the sky , and he kept on following it . He sat with his hands open and moved them up a little and then let them fall , and in him there was a flying thing , I know , and it was like none of us could ever feel . Afterwards , we left him at that place that was long , of red bricks , with wide avenues , with men in blue serge suits , with wide porches where some of them rocked back and forth , not feeling the rocking , but just rocking , pale ghosts on the wide porch , and I saw them there and knew nothing about any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember we played the radio all the way home in silence , and that night we ate in silence , and where Parnell had sat no one sat nor wanted to sit , and no one looked at that place . We could not stand it without him , for as we all said : who had come to harm by him at any time ? And the answer was : no one has come to harm by him at any time . Besides , the orchard needed him , and the house needed him to keep the doors oiled , and so we ourselves in some way needed him as the body needs a mineral substance . But we knew it was a small tragedy , small as a stone and something lost in a well , for we had sinned against him . We called him at one time a bother , a fright , we said , and we ourselves were these and knew . it . Bothersome people who talked too much . Frightful people who did not see the birds fly over the orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at last , but it was different , as I have said , and it was different forever . O H , WELL , look at him and how slow he is now . They say he 'll be forty in March , but I do not believe it . A man could live to be a thousand and still be young if , in his wits , he had as much sense as the Black Creature down there . But no one knows how to do it , and no one knows that Parnell , either . Does he remember anything ? The water of the womb , the break of light , the days when he was a baby , the days one upon the other ? I do not believe it is so single a thing . I do not believe it is ever Monday to him , nor Thursday , not yet night or day , because there is no time to this one , no time , no day , no one color , and it is all one thing to him . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that breathes is like him . The water that endures is like him . The earth that flies is like him . I have watched him since I first knew there was a difference , eaten with him , lived in this same creaking old house . And I know nothing that is true of him or even where he really lives or where his beetling spirit dwells . He sits outside in the summer nights and stares at the stars as he once stared at the " burds . " In the winter he looks at the snowflakes on his mackinaw , and what he sees is lost except in the end , perhaps . " Ah , well , " my granny said , " what man knows another man anyhow until the end ? " And some I have no care to know . They say he has queer ways . It is true that often , in a strange quiet madness , he eats the bark off trees , and sits chewing it and smelling it and touching it until it bends like leather . Other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleeps there in the night , until we take out the searchlight and drive the car over the bumpy , unroaded land and find him sleeping there like some prehistoric creature . " You 'll catch cold , " we say to him , and he picks up his jacket and comes back with us , but I sense reluctance in him . And he turns his head back to where the berry bushes made a sheltered place . Now , because he does this more frequently , five , six times a month , we leave the searchlight on the car , and we go after him and bring him home , shivering a little , and numb from his mortal pain . So he does not read nor write nor wear a hat nor speak many thank-you 's and how-are-you 's that have no sense , either . But he wipes up after the dog , sniffing with pleasure as he does it , and he oils the doors and scrubs the stable floor and polishes the silver on Saturday afternoons . And for no reward . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a hell  --  and so what is there for him ? You give him a cold pear from the refrigerator , and that is his gold and his heaven . You give him a harsh look , and that is his hell . You give him a clean new shirt and a bright tie , fur-lined gloves , hand-me-down overcoat , polished black shoes four years old , and you take him to church on Sunday and he stares at this and then at that with pleasure as from eating peppermint candies . You give him the Montgomery Ward catalogue or a few nasturtiums for his belt buckle where he likes to wear them , over his navel . You give him twine to move end-lessly through his fingers . You give him sweet warm cherries , fresh warm milk , a good warm bed , and from it you receive , hidden , the whole wide and secret thing which you can not tell . There is a giant in the orchard , you think , when you see him there suddenly . And no one can ever tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the end , without the heaviness between us , I will see what is there , and he will see as well . If there is an end , if there is seeing , I will know him then .. ? if there is ever an end . . . Two Styrian Oxen Shipped Collect TN THE summer of 1918 my brother and I were sent to a children 's .11. camp in the Austrian province of Styria . The place had an overwhelming attraction to half-starved Viennese after four years of war : it promised abundant food , for Styria was famous for its cattle . When we arrived , however , we found even less food than in Vienna , partly because the camp 's ration stamps had not come through , and partly because the local peasants refused to sell food to imported Viennese . We were reduced to a miserable diet . But after a month or so a bureaucratic miracle happened : not only did the camp get its ration stamps , but it got also a special allotment of meat out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telegram arrived from the provincial food administrator : TWO STYRIAN OXEN SHIPPED TO YOU COLLECT . Solemnly we children marched to the railway station and returned leading the oxen , bedecked with flowers ; they were slaughtered and roasted that night . It was with less elation that we received , just one week later , another telegram : TWO STYRIAN OXEN SHIPPED TO YOU COLLECT . The camp wired the food administrator to send no more oxen . It was with positive dismay that we learned , a fortnight or so later , that four more oxen had come : all our telegrams had accomplished was to stop the authorities from notifying us . There was nothing to do but to give them to the local usurer to be sold on the black market . From that moment on , the camp heads and the fathers of several of the boys did all they could  --  protested to the authorities , pulled every wire  --  to bring the shipments to an end . Btu somewhere in the mazes of the Imperial bureaucracy a routine had been set up which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Austro-Hungarian Empire was breaking up in wild disorder , on the day we left camp the morning freight pulled in  --  and on it were two Styrian oxen shipped collect . I had all but forgotten the incident when , in 1932 , I found myself in that province . The camp was little remembered , but still , every Thursday , there arrived two Styrian oxen  --  to the great convenience of the local community . Only during the worst weeks of 1919 , I was told , had the shipments been interrupted ; as soon as order was restored the new Yugoslav government had resumed where the Austrians had left off . Sometimes I wonder whether , after the liberation of Slovenia , I shall learn that the Styrian oxen are still shipped weekly . - 0-  Peter F. Drucker
