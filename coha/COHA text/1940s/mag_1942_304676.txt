" Join the Army or Navy and get a college education . " Such was the gist of a solemn announcement by the American Council on Education last week . The A.C.E. and the armed forces had cooked up a scheme whereby U.S. colleges will give soldiers and sailors credits toward college degrees , for education they get in service . <P> One soldier of every two today attends an Army or Navy school ( for technicians , specialists , officer candidates , etc . ) . Thousands more take correspondence courses on their own account . Nothing like it was seen in World War I. <P> Purpose of the American Council 's plan is to enable soldiers &; sailors to cash in their wartime learning after the war . To make sure that schools and colleges do not hand out credits indiscriminately for military service alone ( as they did after World War I ) , the Council commissioned the University of Chicago to design tests . <P> Their object : to find out not only what soldiers &; sailors learned in classes but how much their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army-Navy educational system is its correspondence courses - now offered by 77 U.S. colleges . Army &; Navy pay half the cost , students the other half . But the biggest job is done by Army 's own correspondence school , the Army Institute , with headquarters at the University of Wisconsin . Headed by Lieut . Colonel Francis T. Spaulding , Army Educational chief ( borrowed from his job as dean of Harvard 's School of Education ) , the Army Institute ships its courses not only to training camps but to troops on atolls in the Pacific and in the jungles of Africa . The Army expects that enrollment in these courses will soon top 100,000 . So far the most popular courses are mathematics , bookkeeping , shorthand , trades .
