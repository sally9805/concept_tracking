Republicans were amused and delighted . In a hammer- &-tongs; fight for the Democratic nomination from Washington 's First Congressional District ( Seattle ) , left-wing Representative Hugh De Lacey and rabble-rousing , opportunistic Howard Costigan were tearing an old friendship to shreds . When both appealed for help to the heirs of Franklin Roosevelt , even family ties snapped under the strain . <P> Candidate De Lacey scored first , when Jimmy Roosevelt announced that the Independent Citizens Committee for the Arts , Sciences and Professions was swinging in behind him. * Candidate Costigan immediately dashed off a letter of protest , sent a copy to his good friend Anna Roosevelt Boettiger ( who has lived in Seattle off- &-on; since 1936 , when her husband John began an eight-and-a-half-year term as publisher of Hearst 's Post-Intelligencer ) . Costigan roundly denounced De Lacey as a faithful Communist-line follower who " values the welfare of one nation-other than the United States-above all others . " He pointed to the De Lacey record : anti-war before the invasion of Russia , raring to go afterwards . Jimmy Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna , enclosing a copy of the letter she had sent Brother Jimmy . Costigan , she wrote , is a " sound and trustworthy liberal " who had resigned from De Lacey 's leftist Commonwealth Federation when it hewed too close to the Communist line . Said she : " I am endorsing Costigan . " <P> In great good humor , the Republicans sat back to enjoy the row . Their own primary was not expected to unwrap any odds-on candidate . But any Democratic discord was sure to brighten their chances in the fall . <P> * For other news of Jimmy Roosevelt , see Radio .
