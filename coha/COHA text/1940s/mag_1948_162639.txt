In the vast patio of Buenos Aires ' Institute Bernasconi , white-smocked high-school kids lined up in ranks . In 14,300 other public schools across the country , students and teachers snapped to attention before their radios . It was the opening of the school year . In the presence of President Peron and la Seora , the new Secretary of Education , strapping ex-Ambassador to Washington Oscar Ivanissevich , explained the educational philosophy of the new Argentina : <P> " Our doctrine is of peace , of labor , of rational brotherhood and the welfare of all without caste , race or privilege . The only privilege is for the child whom we must shape into a man , not a beast . . . . This is the revolutionary doctrine . From this day forward we will teach it in all the schools . <P> " We will teach first that children learn to live , afterward that they should learn to know . That they should know less and want more . That they should learn less and think more . That they should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for well-conducted animal spirits . That they should look at and admire the sun , moon , stars , flowers , trees , birds and butterflies . . . . <P> " We will not place in the fertile soil of their intelligence more seed than their natural capacity can nourish effectively . We will fight with all our might against parasitic . . . intellectualism . . . . " <P> In this fuzzy Peronista philosophy , knowing listeners thought that they heard echoes of the primitive naturalism of Germany in the thirties . They got a further reminder in Secretary Ivanissevich 's announcement of a new section of his Secretariat , which was obviously designed to emphasize the supremacy of the Peronista state over private lives . The new section is named " The Teacher is a Friend . " To it , students are urgently invited to bring all personal problems which they feel they can not discuss with parents , brothers , guardians , or friends .                    @
