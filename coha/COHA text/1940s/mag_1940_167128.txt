In Rome last week , good Roman Catholics crossed themselves , averted their eyes from posters which blossomed on walls here &; there in the city . The posters carried a blasphemous " Prayer of the Perfect Italian Fascist , " which clumsily parodied the ancient supplications of Christians : Credo I believe in England , zone of tyranny , creator of sanctions and Masonic gods , and in Eden , her son , our only axman , - who was conceived by virtue of Masonic and anti-Fas cist spirits , was born out of the League of Nations , will suffer always under the spirit of Mussolini , went down to Hell with his father . . . . I believe in the holy Fascist cause , in the resurrection of Imperial Italy of Benito Mussolini , and in the eternal light of Rome . Amen . <P> Pater Noster Our pirate who art British , usurper of our blood , may the massacre of sanction-ists arrive as you have willed it , on sea as on land . End for today and for always your designs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we will repay to your credit the dumdum bullets you sold the Negus . Amen . <P> Ave I salute you , England , full of envy , egoism is yours . May you be damned among sanctionist nations , result of your meanness . Holy Fascist cause , mother of civilization , fight for rights for the greatness of the Italian Empire , now , till the day of our death . Amen . <P> In the Vatican last week , Fascism had its adherents , although obviously not in any such blasphemous terms . There were churchmen who felt that the time had come to bless the victors , in advance . <P> Fascist partisans favored ousting Editor Count Giuseppe Dalla Torre of Osservatore Romano , even though his paper , now confined to the Vatican , had abandoned its impartial stand , no longer mentioned the word " democracies . " Count Dalla Torre acquired two bodyguards . <P> Pius XII was reported to have sent his last peace appeal , in his own handwriting , to II Duce . Disregarded in the Vatican , denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered the Papal Court a refuge in the U. S. , or transportation to any other place the Pope desired . <P> Spain and ' Portugal were mentioned as possible havens . Although the Vatican had supposedly been assured that the Allies would never bomb Rome , it was prepared last week to institute a total blackout .
