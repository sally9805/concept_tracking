Since war 's end , the stock market has been a faulty barometer of business activity , but a fair guide to what businessmen are thinking . In 1946 everyone expected a slump , and the market cracked wide open - yet for two years there was no slump in business . <P> Last week Wall Streeters took a speculative look at the slump that had finally arrived , and decided it was not living up to their gloomy expectations . Result : the market 's seventh bullish week in the last eight . The Dow-Jones industrial average rose 3.15 points to 179.07 , only a shade below its 1949 high . <P> Less Work . Nevertheless , there was little doubt that business was on the downgrade . The Federal Reserve Board 's production index , which had stood at around 166% of the 1935-39 average in late June , was estimated to have dropped another five points , off 34 points from 1948 's postwar peak . In early July , the Department of Commerce reported , unemployment had edged over the 4,000,000 mark for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million at work , more than in any year except 1948 , in some areas there were long lines of the jobless collecting benefits ( see cut ) . <P> Still , the creeping recession had not yet crept all over . Detroit was riding high , with the auto industry driving for its biggest postwar year . Last week Chrysler Corp . came up with record first-half earnings of $6.12 a share , v. $4.11 in 1948 . <P> At the other extreme , the slump in textiles and jewelry had thrown approximately one in five out of work in Providence . But , paradoxically , there was enough buying power left in slump-struck Providence so that butchers could sell lamb chops at from $1.29 to $1.49 a Ib . <P> Empty Shelves . The nation 's department store sales were well below 1948 ( off 11% for the week ending July 30 ) . But some of the drop seemed to be the retailers ' own fault . The Wall Street Journal took a shopping tour of 15 cities and found that many a store had cut its stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some items . <P> In Cleveland , for example , it was " nearly impossible to find attractive summer dresses ... without bobbing into one store after another . In Pittsburgh and Washington you 'll likely have to look in half a dozen shops before you find a summer suit of acceptable size , style and price . " <P> Where they had cut their inventories too much , businessmen were hastily buying again . On its latest check , the Department of Commerce found that manufacturers ' sales were on the rise . <P> More Credit . So were business loans . After dipping for 27 straight weeks , the Federal Reserve Board reported last week that they had edged up . <P> FRB did its bit to ease credit further . It cut bank reserve requirements again , thus freeing $1.8 billion more for lending . This was FRB 's fifth step in as many months to combat deflation .
