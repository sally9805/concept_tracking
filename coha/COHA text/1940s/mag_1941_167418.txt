With the breath of war blowing hot on the nape of its neck , the Office of Production Management last week revised its organization . It had to . In the six months of its existence , OPM had become hopelessly complicated , endlessly tied up in red tape that grew around its acts like ragweed in a melon patch . Manufacturers seeking to get started on vital contracts had to fight their way through labyrinths of bureaucracy . For any broad-scale ruling they had to go to the purchasing division , then to production , then to priorities . The rulings had to be reconciled . In the process thousands of hours of vital time were lost in conferences , argument and devitalizing hiatuses while heels and ardor cooled . <P> Weeks ago , knowing U.S. citizens tumbled to the realization that the job done by OPM in directing the course of national defense was not all it was cracked up to be . Last week OPM admitted the awful fact by announcing its own reorganization . Administration men privately told reporters that even this reorganized OPM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better with production now scheduled within 60 days , if its residual red tape continues to slow the production of planes , tanks , ships and guns , the whole setup will be scrapped . Something else will be tried , perhaps the one-man control of defense that patriots like Wendell Willkie have been crying for . In the prospect that all this may have to be done after the U.S. has gone to war , not even an isolationist could find anything to cheer about . <P> New Plan . To short-cut red tape , let manufacturers settle their problems in one office instead of three , OPM changed itself from a horizontal to a vertical organization . Under the new plan , effective within ten to 14 days , some 30 Commodity Sections will be established . Each will handle the problems of one commodity . Thus a manufacturer , setting out to make uniforms , will go to the clothing section . There he will find ( if the plan works ) most of the rulings he needs on the three Ps that lie between the drawing board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> At the base of each section , advisory committees will be set up , composed of as good men as the Government can get from industries already preoccupied with war-building . These industry advisory sections , headed by Coordinator Sidney James Weinberg , gossipy partner-on-leave from Goldman , Sachs &; Co. , will try to smooth the manufacturers ' way . <P> Topping this organization will still be the Divisions of Purchases ( Donald Marr Nelson ) , Production ( John David Biggers ) and Priorities ( Ed Stettinius ) . Each division head will continue to have the final say in his field , will work closely with each of the Commodity Sections . All three will get added work . Biggers will also head the Commodity Sections responsible for steel , aluminum , magnesium , paper , pulp and chemicals . Nelson will boss the sections where purchasing problems are most important , such as textiles , food , drugs and clothing . Silver-topped Ed Stettinius will also take on rubber , copper , zinc , similar materials , but will continue to exercise his statutory control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section they originate , must be approved by him . <P> That revision of OPM would speed its processes was at least a hopeful prospect .
