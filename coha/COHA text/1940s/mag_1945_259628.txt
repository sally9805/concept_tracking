On the White House lawn , blanketed by the heaviest Washington snowfall in years , Harry Truman frolicked without topcoat , gleefully tossing snowballs . Then , back in his office , he tossed a snowball with a rock in it at General Motors and U.S. industry in general . <P> In a conference room at the Labor Department , the heads of General Motors and the striking United Automobile Workers sat facing each other across a horseshoe-shaped table , presided over by Fact Finder Lloyd K. Garrison and his two assistants , North Carolina 's Judge Walter P. Stacy , Kansas ' Milton Eisenhower ( brother of General Ike ) . Few facts were being found . The union 's Walter Reuther insisted on a 30% raise unless " shown the arithmetic " to prove that such a raise would force higher auto prices . The company refused to lay the figures on the table before " the hungry eyes of its competitors . " <P> Into the room hurtled the President 's missile , wrapped in a mimeographed statement . <P> Relevant Recommendation . Said President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industrial dispute where one of the questions at issue is wages , it is essential to a fulfillment of its duty that the board have the authority , whenever it deems it necessary , to examine the books of the employer . . . in order to determine the ability of the employer to pay . . . . <P> " This does not mean that the Government or its fact-finding board is going to endeavor to fix a rate of return for the employer . It does mean , however , that . . . the question of earnings is relevant . <P> " The detailed information obtained from the books of an employer should not be made public . . . . But the fact-finding board should unquestionably have the right . . . to make public all findings based on such information that it deems relevant to the controversy . . . . <P> " In view of the public interest involved , it would be highly unfortunate if any party to a dispute should refuse to cooperate with a fact-finding board . " <P> The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's books , if not made public , would not be seen by the union either . But he was recommending a great deal more than the company wanted . <P> Fact or Guesswork ? By examining General Motors ' books , the fact-finding panel could obtain detailed information on 1 ) the company 's recent costs and profits on war contracts , and 2 ) costs and profits in making automobiles four years ago . <P> Armed with these facts , the board could estimate probable General Motors earnings under new costs ( including wages ) , new selling prices and new market conditions . This is the " arithmetic " of the company 's ability to pay-but it is more a matter of expert guesswork than of fact-finding . Any mistake in the panel 's business forecasting , if used to determine wages , could prove costly to the company , or even to the union . <P> The President did not say that wages should be based entirely on ability to pay-this was just one of the " relevant facts . " But certainly he had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on both industry and labor .
