THE BISHOPS MANTLE " Lex ! " He was pleading . " I 'll be ready at one . " Her goodbye was hardly audible . Hilary sat very still . There was in his nature a curious capacity for putting himself completely in another 's place . This quality had many times kept him from the sharp , definite judgments of his fellows . Where presumably wiser men saw human conduct in terms of black or white , he , because of his ability to project his personality into that of another , saw also the soft gray nuances which altered the outline . On the face of it now he was hurt that Lex did not at once accept the demands of his office ; but he saw clearly how it must seem to her . On the night she had first told him she loved him he had failed to keep a promise to her . He pictured her there in the library , glowing as he had left her , breathlessly waiting for the ring which would bring them close once more . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have ensued a time of anxiety . She would consult with Mullet . Could there have been an accident ? At last her own nervous call to the Rectory and the receipt of the cold news that Hilary had gone out ! No wonder she was mystified and angry . And would it make her any happier to know the incredible truth that in the tense momentwhen the dark message came from the Coles he had completelyforgotten her ? Then too , there was the matter of this day 's change of plan . A small thing in a way and yet significant of one important fact : he was not only the young man in love . He was , and increasingly would have to be , the priest , also . Before he left for the Coles ' he ran over to his study , glanced at the mail , told Hastings the news of the tragedy and his whereabouts for the day . On the way out , he all but knocked over a young woman waiting at the door . She was slight and he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's quite all right , " she said , laughing a little . " I must have seemed like an eavesdropper listening at the keyhole . As a matter of fact I was getting my courage up to knock . I 'm Miss Mowbray , Dr. Partridge 's secretary , and I wondered if you will want me to stay on . " He looked at her keenly . Hastings was right . She was homely . THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE 41Nose a shade too long , mouth too big , no feature exactly ugly and yet all failing to correlate with each other into beauty or even prettiness . She looked intelligent , though , and her voice was one of the nicest he had ever heard . " Of course I 'll need you , " he answered heartily . " I was going to get in touch with you . Could you start , say , next Monday , after I 've had a chance to get settled a little ? " She nodded . " If you need me sooner Hastings can give you my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurt ? I would n't have come charging out like that except that I 'm in a desperate hurry . " " Goodbye , " she said simply , smiling . " I 'll come in next week . " Hilary thought of her briefly as he drove to the Coles ' . Plain , intelligent , capable . Knew the work , knew the parish . She would be a godsend . Between her and Hastings he ought to learn the ropes fairly soon . He found Mrs. Cole a slender woman just past her first great beauty . Hilary respected her at once . She was ghostly white and drawn and her hands trembled each time she tried to raise them , but she was controlled . Hilary 's own eyes filled as he looked into hers . Once again the whole weight of pain seemed o lie upon his own heart . " You are very kind to come , " she said . " My hus'band told me how you helped him last night . I 'm so confused , but there are things we 9ust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hg 's relaxed . " " I want to help you in every way possible , Mrs. Cole . " " About the  --  funeral . " She paused , her lips quivering . " I know it can not be held in the church . But even here at the house there will be a great many people . Our close friends and Steve 's . The thing I wanted most to ask you was whether you could still use some sort of service which would seem as normal as possible . Even a little beautiful  --  for Steve 's sake ? " He caught her shaking hands in his and held them fast . " Mrs. Cole , the rubric of the church is not our highest authority . The service will be as beautiful and as comforting as I can make it . " She thanked him with her eyes . " Steve loved music so , " she went on . " He was always playing his symphony records . I wondered if it would be out of place to have42 THE BISHOPS MANTLEmusic at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here . Steve had so many friends . I would like to keep the note of  --  of tragedy as far away as we can , for their sakes . " She could not go on . " The music would be right and possible , " Hilary said quickly . " Could I help to arrange it ? " " If you would speak to Mr. Forrest , the organist . It 's so hard for me . I had thought of instruments  --  violin and cello , perhaps . But he will know just what to have . " Hilary promised . As he did so , it came over him with a shock that he had not even met the organist yet . He must look him up that very day in any case , for there would be much to talk over together . It was nearly one when he finally left the house . He had talked to Mrs. Cole , when the simple plans were completed , drawing upon all his powers , physical and spiritual , to give her strength . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had found the listing of the records with his favorites marked upon it , as his mother had said they would be . After Hilary had written these carefully on a card for later reference , he had looked hesitantly around the room . It seemed incredible that only last night he had come in here at the risk of his life , and had prayed beside the dead boy upon the bed . The room was fresh now and empty . In spite of the luxurious furnishings , the simplicity of Steve 's spirit seemed to dominate it . There was a collection of china dogs in a case , and an intricate ship 's model , half completed , on a table . The books , the pictures on the wall , the tray of pipes , the snapshot of a girl in skirt and sweater , tucked in the mirror frame  --  these details looked so normal , so far removed from stark despair , Hilary wondered intensely for the first time what had been the cause of it . Up till this moment his attention had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious as to the strange reasons leading up to the final act . Perhaps no one will ever know , he thought , as he went out and gently closed the door behind him . He drove straight to the McCollys ' . Jarvis , the butler , opened the door . " Is Mrs. McColly in ? " Hilary asked . " Yes , Mr. Laurens , I 'll tell her . And Miss Alexa ? " Jarvis smiled as far as he could achieve that effect . THE BISHOPS MANTLE 43 " Of course . " Hilary tried to return the smile but he was uneasy . He waited in the familiar room , watching the sunlight stream through the casements upon the bowl of daffodils on the window sill and his own roses still upon the table . He turned swiftly as he heard a step . It was Mrs. McColly . Duringthe time he had been coming to the house he had never grown to feel any closer to this woman whom he hoped some day he could name as mother . She was pretty to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vibrant beauty . She was a slender woman with cool patrician features , blond hair and gray eyes ; always charming , alwayscorrect . The results of her inheritance and upbringing had remained unchanged through the years of her marriage with Alex McColly . There was an even propriety about her actions . Once and once only she had done the unconventional thing . Perhaps because of that she had retreated farther into her natural citadel of conservatismthan her friends who had made " suitable " marriages in their youth . Perhaps she only seemed more conservative than most women because old Alex and young Alex were both openly radical upon all minor points of conduct . Hilary went up to her . " I 'm so glad I found you in . " " We 're very proud of you , Hilary . How are the first days going ? " " Rather mixed , but I 'll feel more at home soon . I wonder if Lex told you about last night ? " " Sit down . Lex is n't quite ready and I really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole boy ? " Hilary told her as briefly as he could . " It hit me so hard , for I 'd just come from my evening with Lex . I was pretty happy . I wonder if she told you ? " " Yes , she did , " Mrs. McColly said . " It was such desperate news to get at the very moment I opened the Rectory door . You do see why I did n't even wait to phone her , do n't you ? I should have . It would not have taken long . The thing of it was ... " " You never thought of it . " Hilary 's clear , honest eyes were raised to her face . " That 's right . I ca n't explain it to myself , let alone to Lex . " " There will be many such times , you know , " she said . " That 's what I fear a little if Lex marries you . Perhaps unscrupulous men make the best husbands . " 44 THE BISHOPS MANTLEHiIary 's startled face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . But I do know that if it were a choice between me and his duty my husband would unhesitatingly choose me . You , Hilary , will always , consciously or unconsciously , put what you conceive to be your duty first . Even before Lex . My fear is that she may never adjust herself to that . " " But , Mrs. McColly , I could never put anything before my love for Lex . It 's only that as a priest ... " " I know , dear boy . You will do what your profession demands of you . It is right that you should . Only "  --  she broke off , looking down at the circlet of stones she turned on her finger  --  " we women want everything . We want our husbands to run the affairs of the world and still keep us in the background of their thoughts every waking minute . We want them to be men of honor whom we can respect and yet we want them to give in to our wishes , right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . As I say , we unreasonably want everything , and . . . " She raised her eyes , and Hilary felt in that second he knew her better than ever before . " Some of us give everything , " she finished . Hilary fumbled for words . They seemed trite when they came . " I 'm sure I could make Lex happy . When we love each other , every obstacle will smooth out . " " Do n't hurry her , " Mrs. McColly said softly , for they could hear Lex on the stairs . " Just be sure , both of you ! " Lex came into the room slowly and did not speak as she came . Mrs. McColly covered the awkward moment . " You must come to dinner soon , Hilary . Alex will want to see you . Now I must be off to do some shopping . Such a nuisance this nice spring day ! " She was gone . Hilary and Lex stood looking into each other 's eyes . Then he caught her to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled expression she had worn the night before . " All right , you need n't ask . I suppose I 'll have to forgive you . This time . But I did n't like it and I was very angry , so that 's that . What happened to the Cole boy ? " He repeated the details again . " But now , " he went on , " I 've done all I can for them at the moment . This afternoon is our own . Do you realize this is the first time I 've ever taken you out knowingTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 45that you love me ? Every other time I was so tortured with uncertaintyI could n't half enjoy it . But today ! Oh , Lex , you 're beauti-She colored under his gaze . " No more blandishments ! I 'm not in the best mood yet . But come on , let 's go . Maybe it will improve . " They went first to the florist 's , where Hilary spent an absurdly 1111 long time examining violets . When he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to Lexa 's fur . She watched his long , strong fingers not quite steady , and the hard light melted in her eyes . " Oh , Hil , you are sweet , " she whispered . " Come on before I make a fool of myself . It 's going to be dreadful if I ca n't stay mad at you even for one morning ! You 'll get out of hand entirely . You and your precious parish ! " They walked slowly up to Moxam 's , leaving the car by the florist 's . The spring sun was warm and bright . The stir of the crowds about them only shut them in more closely , more securely to themselves . By the time they had reached the old , high-ceilinged restaurantwith its shining tables and urbane atmosphere they were once more two young people , happy in a love newly confessed . The head waiter recognized Lex at once , bowed deferentially to Hilary and escorted them to a choice table at one of the tall windows overlooking the park . They sat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do forgive me ? " Hilary asked at last . " I guess so , only do n't do it again . " " I 'll try not to . Ca n't you see , though , that no matter what I may have to do , there will always be you and only you in my heart ? Is n't that enough ? " " Would it be for you ? " " What do you mean ? " " Perhaps I 'll show you some time . " Hilary looked sober and then smiled again . " Do n't threaten me . I 'm still too happy . Tell me again . Was it really from the first , Lex ? That night by the river ? " She nodded slowly , the color rising again in her cheeks . " I thought I was crazy . That 's why I went off to Canada . You 've caused me an awful lot of trouble , Hil . " " And what about me ? But it 's over now . " 46 THE BISHOPS MANTLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had ordered , she looked up with a glorious light on her face . Hilary felt blinded by it . " Oh , let 's not argue . I want to be happy today , myself . Let 's forget last night and all the if 's to come ! Let 's forget St. Matthews ! " " That 's not hard , when I 'm with you ! " The sun of the new spring streamed in upon them . There was in it a fresh young quality of delight . They basked in it and drew from it a vast confidence . " It was so silly of me to be angry last night , " Lex said . " It was not , " Hilary maintained stoutly . " I should have stopped to phone you . But we 'll both be right as right from now on . " Near the end of the meal Lex , glancing over her shoulder , frowned suddenly . " How the affairs of the parish do intrude ! That 's old J. V. Dunn who just came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who is Dunn ? " Hilary asked innocently . " Oh , Hil , you have got such a Iot to learn ! He 's one of the richest men in St. Matthews , and a regular old devil if you ask me . He wo n't be a vestryman , they say , but he likes to pull strings from behind . Politics . You know . He does n't approve of me " " Why on earth not ? " " Oh , he thinks our crowd is fast . He 's got one daughter . Poor Maudie ! She does n't know her nose is her own . I 'll venture to say he has you all picked out for her . So , watch yourself ! " Hilary was amused . " What 's she like ? So I 'll be on guard at once . " Lex did not answer for a moment . Instead she sat watching him intently . " You 're so awfully good-looking , Hil . I never thought about it before , but you 're bound to have women falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I 'll have trouble on that score . " " Hilary threw back his head and laughed heartily . " When you are jealous of me , that will be something , " he replied inelegantly . " But do n't let 's talk nonsense ! " " All the same , " Lex went on , " if I ever really do marry you I 'll want you to tell me everything . Every single thing . Promise ? " He looked grave . " All my own life will be an open book to you , darling . That goes without saying . But a clergyman gets entangledTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 47 Ill ; Illin a lot of confidences . The secrets of the confessional , ' so to speak , I could n't repeat even to you . " " I see . I 'm not sure I like that idea . " " Listen , sweet . We 're being foolish again . Ca n't we just trust each other and the future too ? " " I guess so . " As they were leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Dunn ? " " Over there , next the wall . The one with the beak like a vulture . " To Hilary 's amusement , he spotted him instantly from the description . Tough old customer , he thoughto himself . He hoped he could get on the good side of him . It was four when he got back to his study . He found Hastings waiting for him with a sheaf of messages . There were several cards also . Two of the vestrymen had already dropped in at the study to call ; one was Henry Alvord , Senior Warden . Hilary was especially sorry to have missed him , for he had suspected a lack of confidence in Alvord 's attitude . Feeling a faint reproach in Hastings ' tone , Hilary hastened to reassure him . " During the rest of the week I expect to be right here . Today I 've had to be out . Now , first of all , how can I get in touch with Mr. Forrest , the organist ? " " Maybe he 's at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to practice in the late afternoon . " He opened the window nearestthe choir . A faint sound of music could be heard . " That 's him . You 'd better go right down . " " Come along then and introduce me , " Hilary said , knowing it would please the old man . As they entered the church , Hilary gave a sound of surprise . " He does n't have the lights on ! " Hastings stopped . " He do n't need them . Has n't anyone told you ? He 's blind . " Hilary stood still . The vestrymen had stated proudly that they thought they had the best organist in the country . " Forrest , you know . " As though the mere mention of the name was all that was necessary . And he had replied , " Oh , yes , Forrest . Of course . I 'm sure we 've used his music . " But beyond that they had not described him . It came over Hilary48 THE BISHOPS MANTLE now with a frightening realization how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discussed before the actual union of parish and priest had taken place . They had a fine plant , the vestrymen had told him . Buildings worth so much , endowment so much , pew rental so much , parish house so big . These were the corporealities of which the vestry had spoken to him . But all the imperishable elements , all those intangi- bles which made up the church 's soul , he would have to learn for himself , gropingly , blunderingly , perhaps . He felt strange and shy as he approached the organ . He had never had any acquaintance with a blind man before . He asked Hastings to turn on one of the chancel lights , so he saw clearly the man seated on the bench . His head was raised a little , his eyes closed , his whole countenance sensitive and spiritual . " Mr. Forrest , " Hastings said , " here 's somebody wants to talk to you . " The man at the organ played on for a moment as though intent upon memorizing a strain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " In full view his face was more striking than the profile had been . The features were cut thin and clean and the whole expression one of singular beauty . Hilary found himself involuntarily thinking , " Blessed are the pure in heart , " for here before him he knew at once was a man in whom there was no guile . " It 's the new rector wants to meet you , " Hastings stated with importance . " Do n't get up , " Hilary said quickly . He slid to the bench beside Forrest and they shook hands . " I 've heard many fine things of you , Mr. Laurens . " " And I of you . " " Do you mind if I look ' at you in my own way ? " " Please do . " The blind man touched Hilary 's face lightly . He smiled . " I think we 'll get on together , " he said . " I 'm sure of it . There will be so much I 'll want you to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad duty to do on Thursday afternoon . " He told him then of young Cole 's death and his mother 's wishes for the service . " It will be at their home of course and as simple as possible , but there will be people there , many of them young . What do you think about her suggestion ? " " I understand it , " Mr. Forrest said slowly . " I 'll attend to the music . There must be running through it all a note of youth and hope . I 'll plan it very carefully . I know just the people for the instrumentsif I can get them . I 'll call them up tonight . This is a tragic business . We 'll do what we can . " Hilary drew the card from his pocket . " Here are some of the boy 's favorite symphonies . I jotted them down . " He read them over slowly . " Thank you for understanding . L must go now and not interruptyou any longer . I 'm very much at sea about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can ? " Mr. Forrest felt for Hilary 's hand . " I 'm always here in the late afternoons . Do n't ever hesitate to come in if you care to . I 've been at St. Matthews a good many years  --  like Hastings  --  so if I can be of any help , I 'll be glad . I 'm a good listener , " he added smiling . Hilary went back to his study with warmth in his heart . He would have a friend in Forrest , he knew . There would be one sensitiveand sympathetic soul , at least , to whom he could go for advice and comfort . He called Lex at dinnertime and again at ten . " I 'm in my study , darling . I 'm working late tonight . " " Whatever are you doing ? " " Well , there is such a thing as a Sunday sermon , you know . " " Of course . I always keep forgetting . What are you going to preach about ? I 'm coming to hear you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . You might throw me off the track altogether . I mean it . " " Silly ! When will I see you tomorrow ? " " Dinner if it suits . I 'll work like mad all day . " When they said goodbye at last , Hilary wrote to Dick . Even as he put pen to paper he was conscious of the great void in his life . Ordinarily he would be pouring out everything to the Bishop first of all . DEAR DICK : Here I am in my new study feeling , as Grandy would have said , " like a cat in a strange garret ! " The job scares me stiff but I may get over it . Hastings , the old sexton , after suspicious scrutiny , has taken me50 THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE THE BISHOPS MANTLE 51under his wing , the general idea being that if I give him a little lift here and there in such small matters as sermons and sacraments , he will be able to run the parish as usual . Funny old bird but I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A young fellow shot himself last night , the son of one of my vestrymen . Funeral Thursday . It 's pretty tough . Kind of thing makes me wish I were a truck driver instead of a parson . What can I say or do in such an extremity ? Look , old man , here 's something I want you to take seriously . When you write , tell me what sort of sermon you 'd like to hear if you ever went to church  --  which I know you do n't . What do you think the Average Man would like to have discussed by the clergy if he could have a vote ? I may muff this whole job but at least I 'm going to try my hardest to meet it honestly and with the best intelligence and conscience I 've got . Please do n't forget to give this question some thought and reply to it . I 'm desperately in earnest . And now , my cherished brother , for the real news . Lex and I are not formally engaged but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's still afraid of my profession but I 'm confident now I can win her over . The main thing is , she really cares , though heaven knows why she should ! I 'm so slap happy now in my private life it 's pretty hard to get on with my work . In one way , though , it 's easier . The hell of uncertainty about her feeling is over . Well , I know you 'll rejoice with me that I 've got this far . Maybe you could drop Lex a line soon and intimate that I 'm not such a bad egg and would make a marvelloushusband . Write inc soon and do n't forget my question . Hu , P.S. The wedding , when it does come off ( I refuse to say if ) will not be before next fall , so you 'll have plenty of time to shine your shoes for your job . I 'll have Lex pick you out a good maid of honor ! I fancy the whole thing will turn out to be quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would be nice to have it here in St. Matthews with her own rector from Christ Church officiating . The thought just crossedmy mind that , when the time comes , it might be decent to ask Bronson to be here . Since no one knows how we really feel about him it would look like a gesture of respect for Grandy . I 'll talk it over later with Lex . What do you think ? H.The next morning before Hilary had finished his breakfast Hastingscalled up to say the cases of books and pictures and some other crates had arrived . Hilary was boyishly'pleased . If his own things were once in place in the study his whole attitude would improve . He would feel more master of the situation . The very sermon he was working on would go better . He relayed his enthusiasmto Hastings . He would be over at once and they would work in the study all day . He changed to a pair of slacks and his oldest sweater and hurriedacross the court . The sight of the boxes and crates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was never much opportunity for it . In a short time now he was happy with a hammer , prying off boards and scattering nails . When he uncrated the Bishop 's own desk chair he stood for a long moment before it . This in itself would always bring Grandy 's presence into the room . He placed it carefully and then turned to the books . He had no idea until they were finally stacked upon the floor , what a library he had brought . There were all his own volumesand the choicest of the Bishop 's . He and Hastings eyed the shelves and conjectured . " We ca n't attempt the pictures until we get these out of the way , " Hilary said , " and this will be a job . " It was . All the long morning Hilary sorted and placed while Hastings fetched and carried as he was told . They took a few minutesoff for lunch , with another hour which Hilary devoted to necessary phone calls ; then they went at it again . By four o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debris cleared away , the floor swept , the rugs spread , the desk appointments in place . There remained then the pictures . Hilary was tired . The walls were high and he had already made a thousand trips up and down the ladder . Every muscle of him ached . He was dirty . His face was smudged and his sweater soiled . Moreover he was fast losing his temper with Hastings , who had a52 THE BISHOPS MANTLEdefinite opinion about where each picture should be hung . Hilary paused to light his pipe , and then grasped the stepladder firmly before Hastings could capture it . " I 'll tell you what , " he said . " We need a good strong cup of tea ! Both of us . You go down to the basement and brew us a potful , and I 'll get a picture or two hung while you 're gone . " Hastings hesitated but his British blood prevailed . He was in the habit of making himself tea at intervals on a little stove in the basement , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper hour and he was properly thirsty , so with a few last pieces of advice he departed . Hilary mounted the ladder with his hammer and a heavy nail . He particularly wanted a large picture of Magdalen Tower to hang on that wall . He leaned out , tapping gingerly for a studding . He found one . It was off the center of the space but it would do . He knew he should get down and move the ladder but he did n't want to bother , so he leaned still farther , set the nail , and was about to strike it in when he lost his balance and only saved himself from a nasty spill by a quick jump . Even so he was shaken up and uttered an unclerical expletive as he righted himself and the ladder . Suddenlybehind him he heard a voice . " Young man , are you the new rector or a new janitor ? " Hilary turned . He was uncomfortably aware of his dusty and dishevelled appearance . If he had not been , he would have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who glared at him from the doorway . She leaned upon a cane and continued to study him from under a black velvet bonnet . Something in her complete assurance and disapproving stare nettled Hilary . " I 'm the rector , " he said a little crisply , " but at the moment I 'm not sure I should n't have chosen the janitorship instead . " The old lady took a few steps forward . " I am one of the trustees of the Wilson Orphanage for Boys , " she stated with great positiveness , " and I came to size you up and see whether you 're a person to influence them properly if they are still brought here to church . " " And what do you think ? " said Hilary , feeling more annoyed by the second . " Will you sit down ? " " Not just now . I see you smoke . " " You are quite right . I also drink coffee . Very strong . " THE BISHOPS MANTLE 53 " You swear . I heard you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race of men , I do , mildly , upon strong occasion . " " You 're not ashamed to be caught like this , looking like a freightcartramp ? " " Not in the slightest . " She pointed her cane at him . " What about your theology ? Is it sound ? " " Why , not particularly , " said Hilary . " Is yours ? " Suddenly the old lady 's face broke up in a thousand crinkles . A low and incredibly delightful chuckle came from her throat . She tapped Hilary 's chest with her cane . " Young man , I think you 'll do . Sit down here . I met Hastings and sent him back for more tea . I want to talk with you . I 'm Mrs. Warner Reed . " She said it as though the name meant something . Hilary held out his hand , with his own disarming smile . " I 'm not ashamed of my clothes , Mrs. Reed , but I am of my manners . I 've had a day of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit edgy . Please forgive me . " She held his hand firmly while she smiled back at him . " I 'm the bad-mannered one , but I never apologize . At my age , you do n't have to . The truth is , I tried to catch you off guard . I always do that when I want to judge a person . Now , I 'll warrant I 'll know you better when I leave today than if I 'd listened to your sermons and met you at dinner parties for ten years to come . You 've got good eyes . " " Thank you . " " Where 's Hastings , the old fool ? He 's had time to brew six pots of tea since I sent him back . He 's taken a fancy to you . That 's fortunate . If he had n't you might as well pack up and leave . He knows enough about St. Matthews people to put us all in jail . You can get informationfrom him , but do n't let him browbeat you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? About time you got here . I was just telling Mr. Laurens you know all the skeleton closets in the parish . It 's a wonder somebody has n't shot you for it before this . Now you go down to my car and tell Winter to give you that box of cakes . We might as well eat them now with our tea . They 're the kind you like . " Hastings departed , grinning broadly . It was not only his air of-54 THE BISHOPS MANTLE extreme deference which made Hilary realize that Mrs. Warner Reed was a person of consequence . He was forming his own opinion . Under the ancient velvet bonnet was a face of perhaps seventy-five years  --  strong and proud as an eagle 's . Her bearing was regal , her manner the complete unselfconsciousness of the born aristocrat . " Now , " she was saying , " I want to talk about my boys . " Hilary saw the fierce gray eyes soften . " I 've contributed to this Orphanage for fifty years but I never took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . More shame to me . I did n't like conditions when I went . I got myself made a trustee . Now I 'm trying to get some things done and I 'll want your help . Do you like boys ? " " Very much . I was one once . And I have a brother . Between us we know about all there is to know on the subject . You would like Dick , " he startled himself by saying . " When he comes to visit me , may I bring him to call ? " " I 'll expect you to . Is he like you ? " " Not a bit , except in height . He has blond hair and black eyes . He 's a wit and a bit of a pagan  --  I somehow think you and he would take to each other . " " Thank you . I know that 's a compliment . Here 's Hastings , so we 'll get on first with our tea . Do n't you think you 'd better wash your bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already he felt he had known the old lady for years . There was something so forthright , so unequivocal in her acceptance of him that he felt warmed and cheered as he had after his conversation with Forrest , though two more unlike people than the organist and Mrs. Reed would have been hard to find . Because of Hastings ' presence in the background the talk over tea took on a vein of delicately veiled humor , and Hilary found his eyes meeting those of his guest with quick apprecia- tion as they both thrust and parried . Great old person , he kept think- ing over and over , and wise as she 's witty . I 'll need her ! When tea was over Mrs. Reed continued to take charge . " Now , Hastings , take these things away . Mr. Laurens and I want to talk . How 's your wife 's rheumatism ? " " A little better , ma'am , thank you . " " That 's good . See you take care of her . There 's a box for her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when you went down before . Winter knows . " " Thank you , ma'am . She 'll appreciate it , I 'm sure . " Hastings left , more docile than Hilary had seen him before . " Now he 's out of the way , " Mrs. Reed said , " let 's talk about the Orphanage . It 's my big interest , but somehow my plans are always getting blocked . " " Is there any special reason ? " Mrs. Reed leaned forward . " There is . And her name 's Hettie Breckenridge . You 'll meet her soon enough . She thinks she owns this church , and she 's been a trustee of the Orphanage for twenty years . I do n't like her and she does n't like me . Know too much about each other , I guess . When we were young we ate from the same dish practically . " Hilary 's face had a strange expression but he made no comment . " Well , that 's beside the mark . The real point I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to go and see the boys . Talk to them in their own language . Dr. Partridge was the pat-them-on-the-head kind . They called him Old Slobber-Puss . ' But they 'll like you . " " I hope so . I 'll try to get over as early as possible . " " Good . Now I must go . You 're a bachelor , I hear ? " " So far . " " Well , stick to it . It 's an asset to a parson . Every woman in the church from seventy down will moon over you and forgive you anything . By the way , do n't let Hettie Breckenridge ever catch you in that rig . Put on all your ecclesiastical petticoats for her . She 's a stickler for form and ceremony . " " Thanks for the tip . " " And when you want to blow off steam , come over and see me . " " It may be often . " " The oftener , the better . Terrible business about the Cole boy . " Hilary nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pride that asked no sympathy . " I 've had two sons and a grandson , and I 've lost them all . Goodbye , Mr. Laurens . Let me know your opinion of the Orphanage . And do n't break your neck on that stepladder ! We do n't want the bother of getting another new rector yet awhile . You need n't come down with me , " she added . " I 'm not decrepit yet . " When she was gone , Hilary finished the big pictures quickly , and56 THE BISHOPS MANTLE stacked the smaller ones for a later day . He smiled often . He liked Mrs. Reed enormously and knew he would always be at home with her ; and he was interested about the Orphanage . He sobered , though , as he thought of Miss Hettie Breckenridge . She must be Lexa 's great-aunt . It was rather disquieting that Lex had never mentioned her . Of course , there was the old family feud of which he already knew , but since he was to be rector of this parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lex had never talked more freely to him about them . Suddenly he stopped with an unhappy look on his face . He recalled the expression on Lexa 's own when he had asked what her parents ' feeling would be about her being married in St. Matthews . " I think they 'd rather like it , " she had said , with that faint , enigmatic smile . For the first time he felt displeasure toward Lex ; but he thrust the thought from him violently . He would talk it all over with her . She doubtless had her own reasons and good ones for not discussing her mother 's family with him before this . The study in the late afternoon looked back at him now with a warm beauty which filled him with satisfaction . The long wall of friendly books ; the familiar rugs from the old house ; the pictures he most loved ; the desk with the Bishop 's photograph upon it , and his chair behind it ; these all made the room now , Hilary felt , his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was completely banished , and he was glad . Ile had put down his first roots and felt a new freedom and stability because of it . IIe sat down in the kindly western light , staring into Grandy 's strong , spare face in the frame . If the dead lived again and held remembrance of things past , he knew Grandy was with him now . If only it were possible to consult with him as in the old days , Hilary thought . It was now for the first time that the full responsibility of his own rectorship fell upon him . He was the priest of a great parish ; he was the recognized intermediary between God and man . In the sacred robes of his office he would stand before his congregation next Sunday and preach . What had he to say that would touch their lives and melt their souls ? What words of his could meet that deep un- spoken sorrow , or penetrate the secret places of the heart in the men and women who would raise their eyes perfunctorily to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them in prayer ? More than this , it being the first Sunday of the month , he would officiate before that high white altar in the church 's greatest sacrament . Would those kneeling before him at the altar-rail guess that behind his sacerdotal vestments his own heart was full of the same passions as their own ? Or would he seem to them a man apart ? His face was suddenly very grave indeed . He must try , especially for that holy office , to put out of his mind every secular thought , which meant that he must thrust Lex forcibly from his consciousness . For it was impossible for him even to think of her tumultuous beauty without having his imagination swept away by it . So it had been at their first meeting . So it was still . Aside from the responsibility of his first sermon , upon which he wanted to do some more polishing , there lay upon him now heavily the matter of the funeral tomorrow for young Cole . In the circumstanceshe was not permitted by the rubric to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own , and it had better be done at once . He opened his books before him and leafed through , jotting down a line here , a passage there . Suddenly , unsatisfied with what he had done , he rose and went to the nearest bookcase . In it only a few hours ago he had carefully placed the large brown scrapbook which Grandy had bequeathed him . His experience with it these last months had been a peculiar one . At first the very feel of the book in his hands had brought him comfort . But later when he had opened it , the sight of the Bishop 's small , firm , familiar handwriting , the glimpse he had caught of the carefully kept index in which the sacred and the secular  --  true to Grandy 's nature  --  mingled freely , had all brought too much pain . He had closed the book without perusing it . He was too close yet , he had told himself , to his grief . Later he would look carefully into it . Now , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it brought back the poignancy of his sorrow , it was the nearest possible thing to Grandy 's own spoken words . And he had need of them . He drew out the book and took it back to the desk . It was large and the paper was faded in places . Evidently it had been kept by the Bishop over a long period of time . On the front page , recently written , were the words : " To Hilary Laurens , with the love of his grandfather . " And below : " This book contains the advice I have given58 THE BISHOP 'S MANTLEto young ministers over a period of thirty years , together with some opinions and observations of my own which I have kept to myself . I hope it may be of some use . " Hilary looked at the index , under S. He saw at once what he sought and turned quickly to the page . There were only a few lines upon it . " Under these tragic circumstances make up your own prayers as best you can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never go wrong with them . God bless old David . He knew everything . " Hilary smiled . It was as though Grandy had spoken it . He quickly tore up the tentative sentences he had written . The Twenty-third Psalm would be best of all , with perhaps the Twenty-seventh added to it . Then , having settled this , he began with deeper concentration to formulate the prayers he would use . As he wrote once again he felt in his own heart the parents ' agony of grief . He felt the shock of the young life 's ending . He wrote slowly , pausing , pondering , feeling some virtue go out of himself to be spent upon the lines . There was the sound of feet on the stairs and a tap on the door , followed by Hastings ' entrance . " Hello , " Hilary said , " I thought you 'd gone . " There was a pleased air of importance about Hastings . " There 's a young couple downstairs , Mr. Laurens , wantin ' to get married . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at six . " Yes , sir . It 's like this . They was tellin ' me . They 're a simple young pair . He got his thumb hurt in the shop today and got a few days off and they want to get married and catch the eight o'clock train for upstate a little ways , where the girl 's got an aunt in the country . I think you 'd better marry them . I brought up your cassock . " " Thanks , Hastings . Give me a minute and then show them up . Have they witnesses ? " " Yes , a man and a girl . " Hilary stripped off his sweater and shoved it into a desk drawer . He got into his cassock , tied the cincture , smoothed his hair , and wiped his face carefully with his handkerchief . At that moment Hastings ushered in the pair . Hilary warmed to them at once . The young fellow had a fresh , ruddy face , honest eyes , and a great pair of shoulders . He was embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long from the old country . Ireland , HilaryTHE BISHOP 'S MANTLE 59guessed . The girl was little and dark and pretty , and , while also shy , took the situation in hand when the first introductory words were over with . " You see , " she said , " it was my idea coming here , and we never half thought to find you in and all . But I had such a wish to be married in St. Matthews not knowing if it ever could be with us just simple folk , but when Miss Nancy was married  --  she 's the daughter of the lady I worked for for years , but my madam 's dead now  --  well , when Miss Nancy was married , Mrs. Borden , that was her mother , the lady I worked for , well , she invited all of us help to come and sit in the gallery and see it and it was so beautiful and I thought then if I could just be married before that altar to keep thinking of all the rest of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North of Ireland , and I 'm English , so we just come to ask if such a thing could be , sir . " Hilary smiled into her anxious eyes . " Of course it can . And very proud I 'll be of the wedding , for it 's the first since I became rector here . You have your license ? " Joe produced it clumsily . " We 've had it this while back just waitin ' for a good time . Then today when I knocked up my thumb  --  it 's nothing , but it gives me a bit of time off  --  we thought we 'd get on with it as fast as possible . Here it is , sir . " " This is all in good order , " Hilary said , scanning it , " and your witnesses ? " " My girl friend and her boy friend . They 're downstairs in the Parish House waiting to see . Oh , you ca n't know what this will mean to me , sir . " Hilary looked again into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and coat with a blue dress showing bravely underneath . A good girl , and a nice boy , they were , clean and honest and upright by every token , with the beauty of this great moment before them , and then the few days ' honeymoon at the aunt 's in the country ! Beyond this would be Joe back in the machine shop and the girl and her eventual babies , pinching out their drab existence through the years . He spoke quickly to her . " Now , Mary , will you go down to your friends and tell them we 'll be ready in a few minutes ? Just wait with them till we come . Hastings , you 'll attend to the church lights , and light the candles at60 THE BISHOPS MANTLEthe altar . All of them . Then bring me the proper vestments . Joe will wait here for me and we 'll soon join you . " Mary and Joe looked at each other as though fearful even of this brief separation . Hastings looked inquiringly at Hilary , who blandly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hilary spoke soberly to Joe . " There 's one little matter . When a girl is married in a church it 's the custom for her to have some flowers to carry or to wear . " " Ah , that 's right . I might ha ' known . I was so excited like , I never thought of a bouquet . It 's a pity , an ' her so set on bein ' married here an ' all . " " Well now , there 's a little florist shop right at the corner . Why do n't you run up there and get a pretty corsage  --  you know , the kind she can pin on her shoulder . They 're not very expensive . And you 'll be back here by the time I 'm ready . Go down these stairs and out through the court " Joe grinned broadly . " I 'll be back in a jiffy with it , sir , an ' I 'm obliged to you for puffin ' me right about it . " " Do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears . I 'll take the credit all to meself . " It was twenty minutes later that Hilary in his white surplice and stole stood watching as the young couple walked slowly up the center aisle . This , too , was Mary 's wish . He could see as they approachedthat the girl 's eyes were still moist . Her delight over the flowers had been touching in the extreme . He had officiated at many weddings during his priesthood , but never one , he was thinking , which so pleased him as this one now . Joe 's responses were firm in his rich old-country voice ; Mary 's were clear and sweet . He had been wrong about the years of drab living . There might never be luxury or even much comfort . There might always be the pinchpenny hardships . But there would also always be love 's renewal . He felt this as they knelt before him ; his own voice was low and vibrant upon the final words . " That you may so live together in this life that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When they rose to their feet , they stood a moment awed and uncertain . " You may kiss her now , " Hilary whispered , smiling . THE BISHOPS MANTLE 61He saw them off at the church door , hearing their thanks again and wishing them well . The five-dollar bill which Joe had proudly given him he quietly returned to the bride . " It 's the custom , " he said with perfect gravity . " The fee for the first wedding a new rector has , always goes back to the bride . " " It does ? " she replied , beaming . " Joe , just fancy that now ! " When they were gone , Hilary walked slowly up the aisle , watchingas Hastings extinguished the altar candles . " Well , " the old man observed with his Olympian air , " you 're gettin ' your hand in this week . Marry ' em today , bury ' em tomorrow . That 's the way it is round here . " " " I guess that 's our job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I 'll put out the other lights . I want to stay here a minute to rest myself . " When he was alone Hilary sat down in one of the front pews . His mind followed the newly wedded pair . They would sit close as the train tore through the night , the perfume of the roses on the girl 's coat enfolding them . ( He was glad he had thought of the flowers . ) There would be the stop at some country station where they would alight in the darkness with their cheap suitcase . There would be the ride under the stars to a farmhouse . Then at last in some plain little spare chamber , the warm clasp of heart to heart . He felt shaken with the thought . If only some time before too long it could be even so with him and his beloved ! He rose to go , then stopped suddenly , facing the dim whiteness of the altar . He had only realized at that moment that his first act as rector of this church had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary and Joseph ! He put out the lights and hurried up to the study to call Lex . He must tell her ! He must have her know of this strange and tender coincidence . Then , with his hand on the telephone , he hesitated . Would she understand ? Perhaps his own emotion was too tenuous , too delicate to risk sharing with another . It was safest to keep it to himself . CHAPTER IVON THAT FIRST Sunday morning Hilary wakened early . He had set his alarm for seven but it was an unnecessary precaution . The first birds twittering under the church eaves aroused him and while he lay thinking of what the day might have in store , he could hear Morris shuffling softly through the hall . Punctually upon the minute the old man was at the door . " I sure do wish you well today , Mist ' Hilary , " he began . " Thanks , Morris . I 'm glad you 're here to back me up . I wo n't want breakfast until after the early service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mist ' Hilary . That 's the way the Bishop always liked . I dreamed about him last night . He be mighty proud today if he was here . " Hilary stopped to pat the bony shoulders under the black alpaca coat . " I know . I wish he were . Run along , Morris , and fuss with the breakfast . I 'll be ready for a good one . I want to get over to Church early now . " He did not know whether there would be five people or fifty at the eight o'clock communion , but it was his first service and a tremendousnervous excitement possessed him . He bathed , shaved and dressed with scrupulous , almost holy care , trying all the time to controlthe undue beating of his heart . At last he was ready . He went downstairs , crossed the court , entered the side door of the church and went on into the robing room . He had never felt so alone in his life . He put on his vestments and stood nervously watching the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight , he opened the door , crossed slowly to the altar and knelt down before it . The flowers were white stocks and their faint perfume filled the chancel . Through the high , rich windows the morning light came softly . There was everywhere , Hilary felt , a breath of expectancy . THE BISHOPS MANTLE 63Priest and altar awaited ; the Chalice and Paten stood ready with their mysterious symbolism of the ages ; for the first time from his hands the waiting men and women would soon receive the bread and the wine . For the first time from his lips they would hear the words that would , for a moment , make them one with divinity . His flock . He , their new shepherd . With a sudden inner intensity that racked him , he prayed that with his own very body and blood he might serve this people . Footsteps could be heard upon the stone flagging of the aisles . This was a quiet service with only the echo of past prayers and the faint fall of the footsteps until his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reredos towered in sculptured white behind the altar , with the heroic figure of the Christ uplifted against it . Beneath , on the altar itself , the rich violet of the season hung below the " fair white cloth , " the tapers burned , the stocks gave out their fragrance . A great quiet rested upon the kneeling worshippers and suddenly touched his own quick beating heart . He waited for the sound of new footsteps to die away , and then bowed his head and in low tones began to repeat the Lord 's Prayer . As he passed back and forth before the kneeling communicants during the service , the slow rise and fall of his voice formed the weaving pattern of the ancient ritual . Preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life . . . preserve thy body and soul .. . A few faces at the altar , uplifted to receive the cup , became clear to him . One was that of old Mrs. Reed . Her hands were trembling , he noticed , as she touched the Chalice . His own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kneeling there , their faces ashen and set . He found himself pausing a second before them , and then raising his hand in special benediction above their bowedheads . " And feed on him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving . " The other face that suddenly and intensely imprinted itself upon his mind was that of a woman . It was a face of such graven beauty of features that it startled him . She was not young , for the hair under her hat was well mixed with gray , but there was a quality of grace in every line of her kneeling body , in her hands as she cupped them to receive the bread . There was another quality , too , which Hilary , sensitive as he was to spiritual reactions , felt at once . This was the woman 's complete absorption in her own devotions . He found himselfwondering who she was as he returned again to press the Chalice6264 THE BISHOPS MANTLEto her lips . " Drink this , in remembrance that Christ 's blood was shed for thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he went back to the Rectory , he had a feeling of release , of relief from some hard suppression . He permitted himself to think of Lex , almost wishing he had allowed her to come to hear him preach as she had wanted to do . But no , it was better so . He was to go to the McCollys ' to dinner later and he could then talk it all over with her . After these sweet stolen thoughts now , he must again put her out of his mind and concentrate upon the grave duties yet to come . Even though he had been accustomed from boyhood to the contrastbetween the early Communion and the regular eleven o'clock service , Hilary was unprepared for the startling difference in his own reactions to them today . As he returned to the church at ten-thirty he was conscious at once of a pleasant stir and the exhilaration of voices and of sounds . When he reached the study he found two of the vestrymen , Avison and Thornton , waiting to greet him . They were enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over him , himself , apparently . " It looks as though we 're going to have a big congregation . People are coming in fast , already . We had good publicity in last night 's papers , " Thornton said . " Well , we just wanteo to give you our good wishes now before the service . You 'll be at the back of the church when its over ? " Hilary hesitated . IIe had an intense dislike of making a rush for the outer door , especially after Communion , and then of attempting to play the part of genial handshaker to all who passed out . " I would rather not , " he said . " Do you mind ? " The two men looked at each other . " It has always been the custom , " Avison said . " I had planned to wait in the Chapel to speak to anyone who cared to see me there . Suppose I do that today until we can talk the whole matter over later . " " Fair enough , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supremely in his element and robed in his black gown , came up to confirm evidences of a large congregation . As he left , Hilary looked hurriedly again over his sermon notes and then put them in the back of his Prayer-book . He was sure he had the wholeTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 65argument well fixed in his mind . He gazed intently upon the Bishop 's face for a moment , then went down the stairs and on to the robing room where once again he put on his vestments and stood , watching the clock . Strangely enough he did not feel nervous now as he had done before the early service . Instead he felt an excited eagerness , a sort of sublime confidence . So , with a firm finger he pressed the button at three minutes to eleven which gave the signal to the choir in their own robing room below , and then went on into the Chapel where the procession would form . It arranged itself quickly and quietly , giving evidence-of excellenttraining . Hilary was thankful and approving as he watched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad as Crucifer , then the older men and women , perhaps thirty of them . At the very end Hilary took his place . There was a sudden loud burst of melody as the opening bars of the hymn came from the organ . The Crucifer at the front adjusted the great gold cross , his white gloved hands grasping it more firmly . The wide doors were opened and the processionbegan to move slowly forward . Hilary had been completely unprepared for the magnificence of Forrest 's choir . The voices rose now in such richness and volume that he felt himself lifted with them as upon a tidal wave . He , himself had chosen the hymn because it was the Bishop 's favorite processional . So it rang out now , majestic , triumphant , to the highest vaulted stone : " Ten thousand times ten thousand , In sparkling raiment bright , The armies of the ransomed saints Throng up the steeps of light . " As they moved along the front of the church , Hilary 's eyes swept the congregation . Hastings had been right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The throbbing eagerness in his breast increased . It was as though Something , Someone , not himself , was giving him strength . They were moving up the steps into the chancel now ; then the choir filed slowly into their stalls . As Hilary knelt in his place , the last great burst of song rose heavenward . The heart of the organ seemed to strain with the joy of it ; the hymn reached its final exultant crescendo and then died softly away in the Amen . Into the hush66 THE BISHOPS MANTLEwhich followed there came a voice which Hilary scarcely recognized as his own , so strong , so measured , so resonant it was : " The Lord is in his holy temple ; Let all the earth keep silence before him ! ' " The service as it progressed , Hilary felt , was the most beautiful he had ever known . The vast traditional dignity of the ritual and the moving power of the prayers seemed to come to their very flower as he read . Then , when he was at last in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , he knew by that delicately unerring instinct which every public speaker possesses , that he held them in the hollow of his hand . Something of personal magnetism , of quality of voice , of mental power , of strength of spirit  --  something of all these combined , now held these thousand diverse human beings to himself . He knew this , without pride , and because he knew it , he began to speak with complete simplicity and ease . He had searched for the text for this day 's sermon with long and anxious thought . Finally he had chosen one upon which he had always wanted to preach ; the one he considered the most arresting in the Bible . He announced it now with slow and full emphasis : " Be ye therefore perfect . " ' Then with steady , resistless logic he began to reveal its implications . Since the Great Teacher never spoke lightly he must have believed mankind capable of some sort of perfectionor he would never have given this amazing command with such complete assurance . Did this not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race ? Still quietly , but with the same remorseless logic he continued . Since from the context Jesus was apparently laying especial emphasis upon perfection in love , there must lie upon ordinary men and women , who had always considered perfection the one thing unattainablein this world , a peculiar compulsion to strive for it ; to be satisfied with nothing less ; to find strength for the full achieving in the knowledge that it was possible  --  a perfection of love , in the closest of human relations , in the wider circle of friends and acquaintances , and finally in respect to the whole needy world . As he neared the close , there was not a breath to break the hush of the listening congregation . " I stand before you , " he concluded , " on this first Sunday of our union as people and priest . I bring you these amazing words of Jesus as the keynote of our service together ; as the constant ringing chalTHEBISHOPS MANTLE 67lenge to guide us in all our work ; as a measure of deep comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings and in our own renewed faith in ourselves and in each other . " He was back before the altar taking up the Alms Basins , thinking , Did I get it across ? Did they feel it ? Then he was advancing to the front of the chancel . He watched the eight vestrymen who were ushering that day come toward him , with the atmosphere of the world enveloping them , impeccably suited and boutonniered , to receivethe Basins from his hands and then proceed down the aisles as the choir began gloriously upon the anthem . The Communion service which followed was long . Hilary realizedin the back of his mind , as he passed and repassed before the kneeling men and women , that he would be compelled to find an assistant soon , as the vestrymen had suggested . Today , however , the people stood patiently upon the chancel tiles awaiting their turn at the altar , while once again the low , mystic words , like an oft repeated celestial refrain , hung upon the air . The last communicant had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died away , as Hilary faced the altar and knelt for the final prayers . Then again came a burst of melody as Forrest started upon the Recessional . Once more the great gold cross advanced and the procession moved down the chancel steps to the accompaniment of the rich diapason of organ and voices . Hilary followed with uplifted heart . It was over and it had gone well . If only Grandy could have lived to see this day ! He found himself joining in the familiar words with the choir . They were back in the chapel ; the last softened echoes of the hymn ceased , and Hilary 's voice , in cloistered tones , rose in the final words of the service . Then in an incredibly short time , the room seemed filled with people . Hastings , jubilantly important , kept ushering in more and more . The apparent pleasure and satisfaction upon all the faces sent Hilary 's spirits up still higher . A personal note was evident in the voices of the vestrymen . " My wife , Mr. Laurens . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you how delighted we are ! Such a very fine sermon ! We hope to have you to dinner soon . " " Well , you 've made a great start this morning , my boy ! Helen , this is Mr. Laurens . " Hilary started as he recognized J. V. Dunn , of the vulture beak , approaching . He had with him an elderly feminine duplicate of himself and a young woman obviously ill at ease . " Mr. Laurens , my name is Durin . Pewholder here for thirty years . Thought your sermon very good . Want to introduce my sister and daughter . " With this he caught the young woman 's a:m and brought her close to Hilary . " My daughter , Maudie , " he repeated . The girl 's rather anaemic face broke up in small twitchings just as her voice began to emit indefinite sounds which never quite became words . " Maudie 's very much interested in church work , " ( more faint sounds from Maudie ) , " so you 'll be seeing her around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to dinner soon , " the older Miss Dunn said as they gave place to the next corners . " I shall write you . " Hilary would have been less than human if he had not felt his heart swell with the warmth of the greetings and the very evident enthusiasm of those who spoke to him . He tried with intensity to fix names and faces in his mind while the word wonderful seemed to hover in the air . " My name is IIavcrstraw . I just wanted to welcome you and thank you for that wonderful sermon . " " I 'm Mrs. Lester White . I want you to know how happy we are to have you as our rector . Your sermon was wonderful . " As the crowd thinned , Ililary saw old Mrs. Reed rise stiffly from a chair at the back of the room and come slowly toward him . There was a look upon her face resembling the one with which she had first greeted him . She did not smile . Indeed her eyes were anxious . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you 're all right . You 're good . But do n't go and get a swelled head . " Hilary looked soberly back at her . Ile had a swift sense of contrastbetween the hushed service at the altar and the near joviality of the informal reception . " I wo n't , " he said gravely . " But I 'm glad to be reminded . " They eyed each other , still unsmiling , until she turned away . At last there was no one left in the chapel except Hastings andhimself . Hastings drew confidentially close and produced two white missives . " Well , here 's the first ones . I suppose you 're used to this sort of thing . Only bein ' young you 'd better keep your eyes open . These were both some dames though that give me these . One of them belongshere but the other 's a new one . I guess you can handle ' em . Well , I do n't think you did too bad today . " " Thank you , Hastings . " Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took the notes from Hastings and went on up to the study to relax for a few minutes before he went to the McCollys . He faced the Bishop 's portrait with a smile . His head was not swelled , but he knew the morning had gone extremely well and he was grateful and happy . If he only knew where Dick was at the moment he would put in a long distance call and talk to him . He fairly craved this . But he knew how difficult it was to locate Dick . This last mining job he was on was more erratic than usual . In any case he would soon see Lex and talk it all over with her . He wished now with all his heart that he had let her come to the service . He remembered the two notes in his hand . The first was a visitingcard , bearing the name : Mrs. Frederick Waltham Downes . The message and address were written below in pencil , apparently during the service : Your sermon has touched me deeply . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your earliest con-venience ? Hilary drew his brows , recalling Hastings ' comment . This was the sort of thing one had to look out for , from a woman . But he would have to go to see her , of course . It was doubtless genuine . The second missive was a letter , sealed and addressed to him . It was written carefully in ink . He read : I am the only person who knows the truth about Steve Cole 's death . I was at the funeral and heard you there . I feel as if I could talk to you . I 've got to talk to someone or I 'll go crazy . Could I come to your study ? Any afternoon around five . If you 'll let me come , please call Woodside 327 and leave the message for Mary Smith . I 'll get it . Please make it soon if you can. 70 THE BISHOPS MANTLE Hilary sat staring at the paper . So it had been a girl . He found himself dreading the encounter with sharp distaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story would be . Yet he must accede to this request also . He made quick notes upon his desk pad and then tore both missives to bits and dropped them in the waste basket . The week just coming would be full enough ! When he reached the McCollys upon the hour , he found them all in the living room . There was a new warmth in Mrs. McColly 's greeting and old Alex grasped his hand . " Well , well , I 'm glad to see you , Hilary . Glad to see you ! We 've just been hearing about the service . I knew you 'd never keep Lex away this first Sunday . No , sir ! " " You were there , then , after all ? " Hilary said , turning to Lex , his voice showing more pleasure than he knew . " I 'm glad you 're not mad at me . It was all beautiful , Hil . I did n't know I could be so proud of you ! " The red crept up in Hilary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw you ! You did n't take conurmnion . " " No . Muff would n't let me . She was more jittery than you were . I sat up in the gallery . Just melted into the landscape . One more sinner . " In spite of their laughter , IIilary felt a sudden qualm of uneasi- ness . There was a gravity in Lei 's eyes . During dinner as they talked together of the day and of his work in general , he became more unhappily convinced that all was not well . I le kept trying to meet Lex 's glance and failed each time . When dessert was finished , she appealed to her mother . " Do you mind if Ililary and I have our coffee in the living room ? " " Of course not , " Mrs. McColly agreed instantly . " Your father and I are going right up to the library to wrestle with this Benefit business we 've gotten ourselves into , and we 'll have ours there while we work . Come on , Alex . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it necessary to conceal his eagerness to be alone with Lex . " Thanks , " he said . " I have n't too much time . Vespers at four , you know . " " ' Pon my soul , " Old Alex exclaimed , " I never thought parsons worked much for a living , but it looks as if you put in a full day on Sundays , anyway . " " I 'd forgotten about vespers , " Lex said in a startled voice . " Let 's go , Hil . " Back in the living room he took her in his arms . " What is it ? " he soon asked anxiously . " Were you somehow disappointed in the service ? Tell me the truth . I 'll always count on you to do that . " To his amazement her eyes filled with tears . " Disappointed ? " she said . " I do n't know how to say it , Hil , but I 've never been so moved , so completely shaken in my life . That 's the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She drew away from him . He saw that her hands , the little , slim hands he so loved , were trembling . " If I 've been uncertain before about  --  us  --  I 'm terrified now . Do you realize , Hilary , that I 've known you for two years , but always in what we might call your off ' moments ? Never till today have I seen you in your vestments or heard you pray or preach or give Communion . As I sat there and looked at you and listened to you I felt you were an utter stranger . " " Lex ! How can you say such a thing ? " " It 's true . That 's the way you seemed to me . A stranger . So far away I could n't even reach you . " " That is absolute foolishness ! " " And then your sermon . Honestly , Hil , I never knew you were like that . Such a mind . Such power over an audience . It was n't just me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly holding their breath . And then this thing you preached about , this ' perfection of love . ' " He tried to draw her close again , but she resisted , turned away and walked to the window . " I 'd rather never marry you than fail you , Hilary . And I just do n't think I can live on your heights . " He strode over to her then and turned her toward him . His face was set . " I do n't want you on the heights . I want you . . . " " I know . " Her face suddenly became suffused with color . " That 's part of our trouble , I think . But if we marry we get let in for the whole of each other , do n't we ? I came to a decision in church . I hate to tell you but you ca n't move me from it . " He could not speak . His face had gone white. 72 THE BISHOPS MANTLE " I ran away after that first night . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . Muff will come . She loves to travel . I 'll stay all summer and come back to Maine early in September . You can come up then . If we simply ca n't help it , we 'll go ahead and get married and take the chances . But I think by that time we 'll know . " " We will know ! " Hilary 's tone was almost bitter . " Well , I will , then . You see , Hil , if we do n't see each other at all for six months , it will give us both a better chance . You 'll be able to concentrate on your work and get it started . I 'll be able to decide whether I can do without you or not . This will be the final test . " As he still looked at her , speechless , she went on . " Before this , I 've really been thinking only of myself . I know that now . Whether I would be happy as your wife . But now you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . That 's what your sermon did to me . " He knew from the gravity of her eyes and the whole fixed expression on her face that argument was useless . It was Young Alex who had spoken , with the force and determination of her sire . There was behind the words , too , Hilary realized , an intuitive wisdom . In spite of his coming loneliness , his work during these first difficult months would be easier with Lex far away . More deeply and with a pain akin to shame , he knew that Lex had also sensed , as he himself had at times , that the strongest bond that held them was a physical one . He stood silent so long that I.ex seemed frightened . " Say something , llil . Anything . Only do n't look like that . " " When will you go ? " " Right away . We 'll get railings for this week . Dad can always fix things . Oh , Hil , I am as I am . I ca n't help it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think it would be best . No use torturing ourselves . And I might as well admit , " she burst out , " that it is torture to me to leave you . But I 've got to . Let 's cut clean now , Ilil . I 'll phone you my plans and of course we 'll write . " He held her as though he would never let her go ; then when the embrace was over , he left quickly . As he drove back , a wave of physical sickness and weakness swept over him . He realized that every nerve in him had been keyed to the highest point for the morning 's services . The elation afterwards had buoyed him up until Lex had told him of her deciTHEBISHOPS MANTLE 73 sion . Now physically and spiritually the reaction overcame him . For ii six months he would not see Lex . For that period the old uncertaintywould once more fasten itself upon him . Indeed , for the first time since he had fallen in love , he now felt utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his life and Lexa 's ? Even though she loved him , would she ultimately refuse to marry him ? And if so , how could he ever countenance the oncoming years ? With a sudden wave of anger he thought of his sermon on the perfection of love . This sermon , over which he had prayed and labored for weeks , and delivered that morning with a kind of holy joy , had evidently been the concrete cause of Lexa 's new decision . He hated it . He went through vespers in a sort of trance . Fortunately there was only a brief address . It was really Forrest 's service and if Hilary 's misery had not been so deep-seated he knew he would have been stirred by the tender beauty of the music . He forced himself to completeconcentration upon the lessons and the prayers ; then after the benediction he left immediately , not even waiting to speak to Forrest as he had intended . He would see him the next day in any case as they had arranged that the organist would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would consult together about the week 's plans . Now Hilary , pleading weariness to Hastings , slipped out quickly to the court and made his way in a black misery to the side of the rectory . As usual , no matter at what door he entered , Morris , apprizedof his approach by some sixth sense apparently , was there waiting for him . " You all done for the day now , Mist ' Hilary ? " The eager kindness in the wrinkled face brought a sting to Hilary 's eyes . As long as the old man lived , the house would have some atmosphere of home . " Done and done in , both , Morris . " " Did things  --  did they go all right ? " " Yes , I think they did , " Hilary replied slowly . " I believe , Morris , that the Bishop would have been pleased with every service . I 'm just tired now , that 's all . " " I got the fire made up in the library an ' I 'm bringin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mist ' Hilary , ' bout the services . I knowed they 'd be fine . You just go in there now an ' rest yourself . " 74 THE BISHOPS MANTLEThe room looked welcoming with the great fireplace alight . After his supper , during which he told Morris all the details of the day which might interest him , Hilary allowed himself to relax completely . Tomorrow a flood of duties would engulf him , enough perhaps to drown out part of his pain . Tonight he felt weary and bruised and lonely . His mind moved slowly over the events of the day . He remembered the faces of the Coles at the early service . To be there at all must have taken a high courage on their part . Fine people . He would prize their friendship and would try to do all he could to help them in their grief . What of the girl whom he must see soon ? Would her story be one he could ever tell to Steve 's mother and father ? He doubted it . He had a swift intuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his heart of secrets which he might never share . IIe thought of the woman with the beautiful face and form who had knelt at the altar , lost in the sacrament . He had felt a spiritual kinship with her though they had spoken no word to each other . He thought of the later service and the glory and exhilaration of it . At least there would never be any difficulties for him in connection with the music ! Forrest was a master . Before long he must call a vestry meeting . IIe knew he had the support and confidence of the majority of them , or he would not be here . But there were one or two who had held aloof . Ile must win them if possible . He sighed heavily . There would probably be conflictenough in his work without the inner fears and problems of his heart . Lexa ! No matter where his thoughts started , they ended with her . Morris suddenly appeared . " Lady on the phone , Mist ' I-Iilary . " IIe almost fell in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart thudding . The voice which came was that of old Mrs. Reed . " This is once I am going to apologize . I should n't have said what I did this morning . I 'm a bad-tempered , critical , bossy old  --  " " Please . Do n't retract . That 's unworthy of you . You were exactly right and I 'm going to need all your advice and warning to keep me straight . " Mrs. Reed lowered her voice . THE BISHOPS MANTLE 75 " Listen . What I really waited for this morning was to tell you that your sermon was the finest I ever heard . Somehow after I listened to all the other cackling I could n't say it . But now you know . " " Thank you , " Hilary said gently . " I need that tonight much more than I did this morning . " When he had said goodbye he sat , nervous , his hand still on the telephone . He wanted desperately , feverishly to call Lexa ; but somethingheld him back . At last he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed early , and slowly and heavily climbed the stairs . When he was finally propped against the pillows he picked up The Imitation from the table beside him to read a little from it as his custom was each night . This time he leafed through the book until the words he sought leaped to his eyes . Though weary , love is not tired ; though pressed , it is not straitened ; though alarmed , it is not confounded ; but as a lively flame and burning torch it forces its way upwards and securely passes through all . If any man love , he knoweth what is the cry of this voice . Slowly , Hilary closed the book and put out the light . CHAPTER VON MONDAY MORNING Hilary found Miss Mowbray in her little office outside his study already at work on the files when he got there . He was immediately at ease with her . The homeliness of her irregular features was alleviated by the brightness of her gray eyes and the pleasing quality of her voice . Good girl , Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many days had passed he reverently thanked God for her . She knew everyone and everything . She had a way of listening intently to a question , weighing it for a second and then giving the right answer modestly . She showed no embarrassing tendency to load him with information before he asked for it . Together they went over the Parish records and planned a new system of filing . " Do n't tell me about any of these people , " Ililary said at the start . " I know you could , but I 've got to have a clean slate and form my own opinions . If you 'll just indicate the ones who are sick or in trouble I 'll go to see them first . " They went to work on this list , a long one . Then on two sets of new cards Miss Mowbray typed all Parish names and addresses , one set to be filed alphabetically , the other  --  Iilary 's idea  --  geographically , so that calling might be zoned , as it were , to save time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Mowbray inquired once , as she saw Hilary 's growing realization of the magnitude of his job . " Not a thought . I 'll have to come to it soon , though , I can see that . My feeling was that I wanted to get acquainted with the work a little myself before I tried to train anybody else . " " There were two curates here for a long time , and they were both busy enough . In the last years there was only one . Dr. Partridge did not delegate power too easily , " she said , smiling . In addition to the reorganization of the files the mail demandedTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 77increasing attention , for it grew heavier by the day . The invitations to dinner gave Hilary the greatest immediate concern . They ranged from engraved cards to informal notes . One thing was certain . It would be a physical impossibility to accept them all . He had Miss Mowbray sort out those of the vestrymen 's wives first , and then guided by . a curious intuition born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missive from Miss Dunn . Before the week was out he had added another , not without foreboding . It was the crested card of Miss Hettie Breckenridge . The other letters were a strange mixture . Most of them were welcoming him to the parish and the city , many of them were begging , some were evidently sincere appeals for help , some were the work of cranks . Out of them all two hit Hilary very hard . The one was a bitterly critical attack upon his first Sunday 's sermon . DEAR Mn . LAURENS : Although not a member of St. Matthews I went to service on Sunday hoping , from the statements of the press , to find in you the preacher I long have sought . I was grievously disappointed . If any parish in this city needs a thorough arousing from its velvet cushions of comfortable sloth , it is St. Matthews . And to these complacentcapitalists you suggest gently that perfection is almost within their grasp . What they need is a John the Baptist . What they have apparently got  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge lizard in a cassock . A STRANGERThe very next letter he read ran as follows : DEAR RECTOR : Your sermon on the possibility of perfection in love moved me as nothing has done in many years . In all humility I am going to try to put it into practice . Will you use the enclosed according to your discretion for some corner of " the needy world " ? Alv OLD PARISIIIONERIt was a hundred-dollar bill . The curious juxtaposition of the two types of letter was to become familiar to Hilary as time passed . During these first days , however , 7678 THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE he brooded over it . He laid them both carefully in a drawer where he could re-read them , reminding himself of the diverse characters among his audience each Sunday , and of the heavy compulsion rest- ing upon him to be " all things to all men . " While the letter from " A Stranger " was probably the work of a religious eccentric , yet there was a note in it which he could not afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of people of wealth or at least of a comfortable coin- petence of this world 's goods . While they would of course be vul- nerable along with the rest of mankind to the inevitable blows of sickness and death , they would still be untouched by the peculiar sorrows of the poor . Each day as he walked the surrounding streets he was more conscious of the contrast between the beauty and corn- fort of the church itself and the drab poverty represented in the string of tenements and cheap apartments just behind it . He sat late at his desk one night , considering , and finally made his first great decision relative to his ministry . In so far as he was capable he resolved to divide his time and attention between the present pew holders of St. Matthews and another yet invisible con- gregation which he had in mind to serve . Past the great church each day walked a motley multitude . Unknown men and women worked in the lofts and factories all about . Within easy access were endless dwellings where poverty ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he going to do about this ? Ile already had several ideas . With the hundred-dollar bill as a nucleus he would try to build up a so-called discretionary fund , the many uses of which he could already imagine . This could be only the proverbial drop in the bucket but it would be at least concrete . But more than this . Above the long blocks of rented pews in St. Matthews ran the gallery . This was free , and as Hastings had re- ported , usually empty except for a few transients and the Orphanage boys . Hilary had an immediate picture of a strong , integrated gallery congregation , drawn from the ranks of the humble . Then there was the Parish House . Its uses had deteriorated some- what during Dr. Partridge 's declining years , he gathered from bits of evidence here and there , but the building was amply furnished , ready and available for whatever uses he wished to put it . Night after night , Hilary sat at his desk , weighing one course of action against another , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame . He was preparing for the specialmeeting with his vestry at which time he would outline his plans . Meanwhile his personal problems had resolved themselves temporarily . Lex was gone . In accordance with her usual promptness of action she had sailed with Muff for France ten days after their talk . In spite of their first decision Hilary had gone to see her off , his heart like lead in his breast . She had never seemed so utterly dear to him as in that last moment when she had broken down , raising misty eyes to his . " I do n't know whether I 'm more afraid to go or to stay , " she had whispered . Then the bell rang , the crowd jostled , and he had found himself ashore with her father and mother , watching , waving , until her small figure in the shadow of Muff 's tall , protecting one was lost to the sight . He had come back with something in his heart poorer than hope and a little better than despair . One thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the fact that her complete absence gave him a feeling of mental release . The fact , though , that she had been wise enough to foresee this , frightened him . Did this mean then that there was wisdom in her other conclusions also ? In so far as it was possible he drove this idea from his mind and his hunger for her from his heart and concentrated fiercely upon his work . On a dull , rainy afternoon , Hilary sat at his desk with a nervousnesshe could not control . He had left the message for " Mary Smith " suggesting five o'clock that day . Would she come ? What would she be like ? What story would she tell about Steve Cole ? He somehow hated this encounter . He had dined quietly with the Coles a few nights before and their dignity , self-control and essential courage had again moved him deeply . Two rare souls , they were , who claimed him now as a friend . To him at least they talked of Steve as though it eased their unendurable grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged full grown before him , fine , sensitive , gifted , full of promise . He was to have been a doctor . His own dread now was that the coming interview would do violence to this character . There was a tap on the study door and Miss Mowbray 's voice . " Miss Smith is here . " Hilary stood up and looked at his caller . He saw a tall , slender80 THE BISHOPS MANTLEgirl in a small hat and a raincoat . Her thin face was shockingly white and taut , as though the bones might at any moment pierce the delicateskin . Her eyes were the saddest he had ever seen . He went forward to meet her and drew a chair . " Sit down , " he said warmly . " It 's a nasty day out . I did n't know when I called up that the weather was going to be like this . " She made a small gesture as though dismissing the weather . " My real name is Francine Avery , " she began in a voice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story should not be long I will try to tell you quickly . It is very hard but it is harder still to keep silent . I have to talk to someone . I felt it must be you . " Hilary met her gravity instantly . His voice was very gentle . " Please tell me all that lies upon your heart , Miss Avery . I think I understand your feeling . It helps to give sorrow words ' . " She sat tensely forward in her chair , the raincoat which she had not taken the trouble to remove giving her the appearance of a child . She fixed her dark eyes firmly on the window behind Hilary and began . " I grew up in France . My mother was French , my father English . He died when I was very small . My mother was a ( lancer . I am also . We lived very strangely abroad , very unconventionally . I do not mean to excuse myself , only to tell the truth . I was not brought up as the usual French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country with a roan I  --  knew . I have had some success here . There have been several men who  --  helped inc . It was of small meaningto me , what happened between inc and them . I cared for none of these men . " She gave a tragic little gesture . " This is what is so necessary for you to believe . My heart felt nothing  --  nothing . I wanted to get on in my profession . I did only what seemed to me practical and , as I had been brought up , natural . " She stopped , her eyes on his face with an alarming fixity . " I cannot go on unless you believe this . " " I do believe you , ' Hilary said . Something of the tension in her slight figure relaxed . " Yes , " she said , " I see that you do . I met Steve at the night club where I was dancing . From that moment we loved each other . At first I did not question anything . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had taught me . Then , when SteveTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 81wished to take me home to meet his mother and father , I was suddenlyafraid . " Her hands were clasped so tightly now that Hilary felt in himself the hurt of the clenched fingers . " I considered saying nothing of my life before . But he was too good . I loved him too much . That last afternoon I told him everything . The reason I ca n't sleep now is seeing the look on his face . He was so very white . He kept saying , There will be some way ; do n't worry . ' Then he went home . The next day I read in the paper what happened . " She stopped . The story was told . Hilary sat , looking at her , shaken . The violence of the contrast between the truth and his own imaginings left him speechless . " The thing which makes me so confused , " the girl went on slowly , " is that I did what I felt to be right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would now be alive and we could have been happy always . Now since I killed him I do not care to live . I would rather do as he did . " Her eyes met his , seeking , distraught . The old feeling of inadequacy for a moment engulfed Hilary . How could he guide her , comfort her ? What words would be given him to speak ? Looking at the girl , though worn now and careless of her beauty , he could see why Steve had loved her . Her strange charm , the compelling quality of her personality , her essential sincerity of heart and the dancer 's grace of her body , would attract any man . But by the extremity of the moment , and the deep prayer of his own heart , he felt himself entirely removed from all of this . He was not a man , he was completely the priest of God . " Francine , " he said , using her name simply , " my dear child , you must consider first of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your duty . The consequences are not your responsibility . Leave them in the hands of God . In the next place you must put from you all thought of ending your own life . I believe in another world after this . I believe Steve is there now . " " You do ? " Her tone was full of amazement . " Of course . God is surely not less understanding than we poor humans . But Steve 's immortality in this world depends upon those who loved him . A part of him will always live on in your heart . You82 THE BISHOPS MANTLE must treasure that and see that no violence comes to it through you . This , too , is a duty . Do you understand ? " She was very still for a moment , then slowly nodded her head . " I had not thought of it in that way . " " Are you a Catholic ? " he asked . " No . I 'm not anything , really . I think I was christened as an infant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve 's church , and eventually to be confirmed . But right now , next Sunday , if you do n't mind getting up early , I want you to come to the eight o'clock Coin- munion . No one else will know whether you are a member or not . Come and say a little prayer for Steve 's soul and for your own . It will do you good . Will you ? " Once again she thought his words over . " Would I know what to do ? " " Just follow the others . It 's very easy . And now , most of all , you must drop this burden you 've been carrying . 1 do not of course mean your grief . But put all that you should forget out of your mind , out of your life . Start all over . Keep your love for Steve and begin now to be all he thought you were . Forget the rest . " His voice was firm . " Work and rest , pray often , and go on living . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly overflow with tears . " I have n't been able to weep before . " Hilary rose . " It will relax you . I want to speak to my secretary . Excuse me for a moment . " Once outside he said to Miss Mowbray . " What about a good strong cup of tea ? " She smiled . " It 's ready . I thought from the look of her we might need it . " She brought a small tray with two cups . " 1 ' 11 set it in . I think you can do with one yourself . " The girl was still weeping when he returned , slumped in corn- plete exhaustion in the chair . Ile wondered anxiously if there would be strength enough in her body to enable her to rise eventually . Miss Mowbray set down the tray and left as quietly as she came . The cup shook in Francine 's hand , but she drank the tea gratefully and then with a great effort pulled herself together , and rose . " I must go , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please know . . " Of course , " Hilary said . " I only want you to promise to come back whenever I can help . Will you ? " " And Sunday morning ? " " I shall count on your being there . " She stood a moment , hesitant . " And you really think  --  you feel even in spite of all I 've told you  --  I can ... " She faltered and stopped . The words came instinctively to Hilary 's lips . " May the Lord bless you and keep you , Francine . May he lift up the light of his countenance upon you and give you peace . " As she left , she turned and for the first time smiled . Even through the tears the smile transformed her face . Hilary realized again how young Steve must have loved her . Oh , the torturing , agonizing sorrows of love ! How mysteriously for his own vast purposes the Creator had wrought the miracle of sex ! Sex and religion , he brooded , as he sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life ! He wondered anxiously , as always , if he had said the right thing . Had he said enough ? Reflecting now , he felt his words had been perhaps too few . Should he have given a different sort of counsel , dwelling more upon that period of her life , the irregularities of which had brought about the tragedy ? Should he have spoken of penance and sackcloth and ashes ? No , he decided with vehemence . Not that . Her anguished eyes gave their own proof . It seemed to him clearly a case of " Neither do I condemn thee . " As to his urging her who belonged to no church whatsoever to come to Communion , that was perhaps open to criticism . And yet the whole meaning of the sacrament , as he saw it , was the union of the weak , needy soul of man with the great , suffering , compassionatesoul of God . Well , then . Surely in this case the conditions were met . A purely technical exception could be made . Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little wryly . No matter , he thought , I must serve humanity in my own way . It was some days later that he answered in person the other84 THE BISHOPS MANTLE THE BISHOPS MANTLE 85 missive of that first Sunday . He found Mrs. Frederick Waltham Downes a young woman in a luxuriously modernistic apartment . She was tall , with dark hair brushed high above small ears , her skin creamy against the red violence of her lips . She wore a black dress which enhanced every line of her beautiful figure , and her voice was low , soft and sad . " This is so good of you , Mr. Laurens . I had scarcely hoped you would come so soon , but I need help terribly . " " I am anxious to serve you if I can , " IIilary said sympatheti- tally . " A new rector is always at a disadvantage at first . He must try to know so many people so quickly . And fails , of course . You must tell me , if you will , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her hands , white and ringless in her lap . " My husband died eight months ago . I have no child , almost no relatives . I am inexpressibly lonely to the point of melancholy . My life is completely empty . I feel I must cultivate some new power within myself and I ca n't do it alone . If 1 had a new interest , too , it would help . " She hesitated and raised her eyes , very large , dark and luminous , to his face . " Would there be any way you could use me iii church work ? " Hilary was touched . IIe chose his words carefully , as he first recommended certain daily spiritual exercises . " I 'll send you sonic books which I think will be of great help to you . Keep them as Iong as you need there . And as to church work , of course we can use you . It 's rather wonderful for anyone to ask for it as you have . Shall I let you know as soon as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ! I feel already that I have something to live for . The friends I have "  --  she smiled with a gentle tolerance  --  " are not the type to help me in matters of the spirit . " She rang for tea ; then , as she served it , began to speak lightly of other things  --  books , plays , travel . Without losing the veil of sadness which enveloped her , she seemed unselfishly eager to keep from intruding her sorrow further upon her guest . Her pitiful tour- age appealed to Hilary and he exerted himself to his utmost to be entertaining . " You have done so much for me , " she said as he left . " I promise not to make a nuisance of myself , but if I get down too deeply in the depths again , may I ... " " Please call me , " Hilary said earnestly , " and read the devotional books I 'm sending you very carefully . They have helped me . And now , be brave . " The impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator bore him down to the lobby . It had been a prolonged one for the simple reason that Mrs. Downes had not let go . She was merely grateful , Hilary thought . And do n't be a vain ass , he adjured himself severely . The most disquieting experience of his first weeks was a call from Henry Alvord , Senior Warden , the one man on the vestry for whom Hilary had held a mental reservation . He dropped in one day , pleasantly enough . He was a tall , spare man with a waxed gray mustache and cool , calculating eyes . His contribution to the church represented the largest single item of its support . He talked on in friendly fashion of generalities while Hilary felt his heart sinking into his shoes . He had a premonition that there was more to this call than met the eye . Alvord finally leaned back in his chair with easy grace and slowly put out his cigarette . " I 'm sure you 'll not resent a word or two of advice from an old member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hilary replied . " Churches are like families , " Alvord began deliberately . " Some either have no roots or they are negligible . Others have very deep roots and very distinct traditions . St. Matthews is one of these . For a hundred years this church has served the type of people who appreciate the beauty and dignity of its edifice and its service . They have built through the years certain traditions which I hope may never be broken or infringed upon in any way . " He paused , watching Hilary . " I understand perfectly what you mean , " Hilary said quietly , meeting his eyes . Alvord looked gratified . " Another thing  --  forgive me for speaking so plainly , but it is as an old man to a young one . Many young men in their twenties and thirties are moved by a great desire to change the existing social and economic order . It is perhaps a more or less normal86 THE BISHOP 'S MANTLEyouthful reaction . They would , if they could , overthrow certainah  --  systemswhich have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly seventy years . I 've watched many young men foolishly break their heads against a wall which is essentially a good wall . The tried and proven order is the best . I am quite sure the great majority of St. Matthews ' membership believe this as firmly as I do . I wonder if you  --  ah  --  follow me ? " Hilary nodded . " Once again I understand you perfectly . " Alvord rose , smiling . " I 've enjoyed this call . I hear nothing but the highest praise of you in every quarter . You have here in St. Matthews the greatest opportunity that any young clergyman could ask for . I 'm sure you will fulfill our expectations . " Hilary stood silent for a moment . " I 'm glad you came in , Mr. Alvord . And I 'm very glad also that you have told me so frankly what you would like my policies at St. Matthews to be . " The older man looked somewhat startled and his dark , straight brows contracted a little . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This does not mean , however , that I agree . But understanding is the real basis of friendship and I want very much to be your friend . May we leave things so while I think over carefully all that you have said ? " Hilary smiled with his unconscious , disarming sincerity and held out his hand . Alvord grasped it . " I 'm sure you 'll agree , " he said . For your success here , as I see it , depends largely upon that . " As Hilary walked to the door with him he said earnestly , " Will you drop in again and give me your advice and help ? I need plenty . " The older man looked touched and gratified as he promised . But after he was gone Hilary went back to his desk and slumped into the Bishop 's chair . " No change in the type of membership and no socialistic tendencieson the part of the rector  --  or else ! " he muttered dispiritedly . He felt defeated before he had rightly begun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been without foundation . He had noticed that the other vestrymen deferredto the Senior Warden 's opinion ; and now he had read in the older man 's eyes during the interview Alvord 's complete confidenceTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 87in being able to manipulate the new young rector 's policies to his will . Hilary 's strong chin stiffened . This , then , was probably to be his first major conflict . He must win over Alvord or lose him . With a deadly clarity he saw the full possibilities of his position . Even as Alvord had said , no young man could ask for a greater opportunity . With the least compliance , the least compromise of which no one but himself would ever be aware , he knew he would have steadily mounting success . He realized with a sudden complete perception the extent of his own powers . He knew , too , half ashamed , that a great ambition lay buried in his heart . A bishopric some day , even as Grandy . Yet Grandy had never compromised . The very thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hilary remembered his grandfather 's face once a few years ago , lean and finely tempered and whimsical in the firelight , as he had sat talking of diocesan affairs . " When a stubborn and worldly man insists upon pulling you round by the nose , Hilary , there 's just one way to deal with him . Tell him to go to hell . Not in those words , of course , but make the general idea clear . " No , Grandy had bowed his righteous head to none in a matter the bottom , as it were . Slowly , steadily mountingthrough small parishes to greater ones , his influence and personalityhad gradually made themselves felt throughout the diocese . In Hilary 's case , he was beginning at the top . There would surroundhim from now on the glare of publicity which would throw his every act into sharp relief , often accentuating the outlines out of proportion to their true relations . If only it were possible .. . He did not hear the door open . So when the voice came he jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , how 's the Man of God ? " It was Dick , sauntering casually toward him , as though he had been there only the day before , his black eyes twinkling , his long , blonde face set in its customary quizzical grin . Hilary grabbed him by the shoulders and found he could not speak . Never in all his life had he been so glad to see any one . There was a queer but unmis-88 THE BISHOPS MANTLE takable mist in his eyes . Dick looked straight through him as usual , and then slapped him heartily on the back . " Steady , you big lug . I thought for a minute you were going to kiss me . Quite a set-up you 've got here , Hil . " " The Lord certainly sent you ! " " Well , I doubt if he bothers much about my movements but I 'm here anyway . Had n't time to write so I came instead . How are things going ? " " Come on , let 's go over to the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can talk all night . I-low long can you stay ? " Dick shrugged . " Oh , a few days . Have a little business here I want to attend to . How 's Lex ? " " She 's gone abroad . I 'll tell you all about it later . How do you like my study ? " Dick roamed around , commenting upon familiar books and ob jects , then came to a standstill in front of the Bishop 's picture . " Still cuts pretty deep , does n't it ? I 'm always expecting a letter  --  forgetting , you know . Well , let 's get going . I want to see your ecclesiastical habitation . " When Morris opened the door , he all but tottered in his surprise . His delight was pitiful . IIe could n't let Dick out of his sight . When the brothers were finally seated at dinner his ministrations were almost annoyingly persistent . " I feel like an infant robin , " Dick said once when the old man was in the kitchen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth . By the way , why do n't we just have hirn sit down and eat with us ? He 's the nearest thing to a parent we 've got now . " Hilary considered . " For one thing he would n't like it . It would disturb and confuse him . lee 's completely happy doing what he likes best to do , taking care of us . I guess just letting him overdo it to his heart 's content is the kindest thing on our part . " " He 's aged shockingly these last months . Ile 's not young any more , Hil . " " I know . I worry about him . He 's lonesome and there 's not much I can do about it , until  --  unless . . . " " Of course , " Dick filled in quickly . Then as they went back to the library , he added . " Tell me as much as you want , old man . You seem bottled up . I thought from your letter all was rosy . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only worse . The parson stuff . She came to my first service and got completely scared out . The devil of it is I understand how she must feel . I almost wish I did n't . I could fight harder then . Anyway , she 's gone abroad with Muff to be gone all summer . In September we 're to meet up in Maine , and then it will either be all on or all off . The last throw . " " " Meanwhile , as St. Paul delicately puts it , you burn . " " Right . " They smoked in silence for a while and then Dick said suddenly , , " It 's a funny thing about us . Hailing from the same loins and yet as different as day from night . I have no desire whatever to get married . Women , yes . I 'm normal enough , God wotteth , but to look at the same one for the rest of my life  --  no . The thing I could n't stand if I had a wife would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Time is so damned cruel to women . That 's their primeval curse , I guess . Well , I would n't want to watch the thing operating behind my own breakfast coffeepot , that 's all . " Hilary laughed . " You forget , my lad , that time would also be operating behind the bacon-and-egg platter ! " " I know , but it 's not quite the same . Nature gave men the best break by a jugful . " " It 's odd you should bring up just this , " Hilary said soberly , " for I was thinking only a few days ago that if I were lucky enough to marry Lex I would like watching her grow older . I 'm sure I would never mind time 's changes in her face . The thing that set me off on this was seeing a woman who comes to early communion every Sunday . " He paused to fill his pipe . " I do n't know yet who she is but her face haunts me and she 's far from young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes a girl look a bit empty , if you see what I mean . No , if all I have to worry about is women 's primeval curse , as you call it , I 'll take it and jump at the chance . By the way , about my letter . I asked for some advice , and I was dead in earnest . I hope you 've thought it over . " " Oh , your sermons . Now , there was an unexpected compliment ! " To Hilary 's surprise , however , Dick did not proceed with his usual raillery . He was serious . " I honestly do n't know what to tell you . I ca n't think of anything in particular I 'd like to have preached at me . But there 's one thing90 THE BISHOPS MANTLEI 've always felt very strongly about . I do n't think any parson has a right to harangue a congregation as though they were a bunch of sinners . " " Why , are n't we all ? " Hilary asked in mild surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow I ca n't see it . People have such a darned lot to bear from life . And remember , they never asked to be born in the first place . They have to take the blows as they come and do the best they can . Take old Sickle-Back at college . " " Yes . " " About the only thing I remember from that course is the way he used to look up suddenly and say : " 0 Thou who Man of baser earth didst makeAnd even with Paradise devise the Snake ; For all the sin wherewith the face of manIs blackened , Man 's forgiveness give  --  and take ! " " I remember that , too . Poor old Sickle-Back ! They said he always quoted it when the pain got past bearing , which was pretty often . Great eyes , he had . Really a handsome man , if he had n't been deformed . I got a lot out of that course of his . And look , I do see what you 're driving at . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to think over . Man 's forgiveness , give and take . ' That line never fully hit me before . You see the whole problem of sin is involved . . . " " Not tonight , it is n't ! " Dick interrupted with a laugh . " I 've been serious long enough for once . Tell inc the lighter news of the parish . What have you been doing socially ? Have you met some nice people ? Have you run into your first lonely widow yet ? " Hilary turned and stared at his brother . " Now what in the world made you ask that last question ? " Dick grinned . " Touche , eh ? Oh , I guess that old parody Grandy used to chuckle over made me think of it . Some other Bishop told it to him . Do n't you remember ? Pure religion and undefiled for the parson is this : To visit the widow in her affliction and keep himself unspotted .. : " Hilary laughed heartily and then looked troubled . " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectlysincere . Yes , I 'm sure she is . " " Well , watch your step . You 're a personable youth ! " " Mist ' Hilary . " It was Morris at the door . " Telephone for you . " THE BISHOPS MANTLE 91When Hilary answered , a woman 's breathless voice spoke . " Mr. Laurens , this is Mary McComb . You mind you marriedJoe and me ? Well , Joe 's sick and I 'm so frightened . The doctor 's been and he says it 's his appendix and he 's to get to the hospital at once and he 's called the ambulance and he told me it might be too late , for Joe would n't have a doctor sooner and I 'm afraid they'lljust let any one operate when we get there and he 's bad , you know . I do n't know what to do . " " Where do you live ? " " Right back of the church at 600 Sinclair Street . We 're on thesecond floor . " " I 'll be right over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and death . He grabbed his hat and called to Dick " Sick call and it looks serious . I 've got to hurry . " Dick was at the door in a flash . " Good luck , old man . Take iteasy . I 'll wait up . " It was quicker to walk than get the car . As a matter of fact Hilary ran most of the way , hoping no policeman would stop him . He found Mary white and terrified and one glance at Joe on the bed confirmed his fears . " Where 's the doctor ? " " He had to leave after he called the ambulance . He said he could n't do anything more just now . " " Which hospital is Joe to go to ? " " St. Luke 's . " Hilary thought fast . At a dinner the week before be had met a Dr. Shane , a bachelor , a dark , quiet man who , his host had told him on the side , was considered the finest surgeon in the city . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate . He found the number in the telephone book and dialled quickly . It was a chance in a thousand he would even be at home , for he was socially prominent . He was at home , and still at dinner . The butler made it clear , however , that he should not be disturbed . " Please tell him this is the rector of St. Matthews calling andthat it is very urgent . " In a moment he heard Dr. Shane 's voice . " This is Hilary Laurens , Doctor ; I 'm ashamed to trouble you , 92 THE BISHOPS MANTLEbut I'rn with a young man who 's in a bad way . Appendix . The doctorthey finally called in said he feared it was too late to operate but ordered an ambulance from St. Luke 's . Could you possibly help us ? " " Glad it 's St. Luke 's . Tell the men when they get there that I 'm operating and they 're to handle the patient carefully . What 's the man 's name ? " " Joseph McComb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye . " Hilary was stunned at the brevity and the compliance . He turned to Mary . " I 'll go down to the sidewalk and wait for the ambulance . Be brave now . We 've got the best man in town . " The ambulance came in a few minutes . The young interns showed a slight change of expression at mention of Dr. Shane . They worked skillfully , and in the shortest possible time they were all on their way . It was the first time Hilary had ridden in an ambulance . So often he had watched them passing swiftly along the street with their still burdens , part of the world of sickness and suffering and death to be noted and then forgotten as quickly as possible by those who in happiness and health pursued their normal way . Now as an integral part of that darker world , he rode along , conscious of Joe 's big body inert on the narrow cot , of the interne with the keen eyes bending above him ; of the bride , Mary , stricken , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's steady , casual expertness . It was a long wait in one of the hospital 's sunrooms . Hilary and Mary were alone in the impersonal , institutional atmosphere . They could see nurses passing unconcerned through the halls , each living her own removed emotional life below the professional surface . They could hear the dull metallic movements of the elevator as it made its steady trips up and down . Night and what peace it could bring had descended upon the great building . But somewhere , they knew , Dr. Shane , instead of having coffee at home after dinner , was standing white-robed in a hot glare , his dark face intent , his trained fingers at work upon Joe 's flesh . Hilary sat beside Mary on the reed settee and held her hand in his own strong one . Once in a while he spoke but most of the time they both prayed . He could see Mary 's blue lips moving ; and as to THE BISHOPS MANTLE 93himself , with agonizing intensity he offered his own supplications that Dr. Shane might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe might live . Once as he wrestled through the powers of darkness up , as he hoped , to the throne , a line he had once read came to his mind : " Great sin is there in taking Heaven by storm . " Was it indeed wrong or unethical , he wondered suddenly , to try to tear through the veils of flesh to reach the spirit of God , and demand his favor and intervention ? Sometime he must think of this more carefully , but not now . He went on praying , and the first slow hour became two . As the third passed he found his petitions concentrating upon Dr. Shane . Once Mary gave a sob . " Maybe we loved each other too much ! We 've been so happy . " " You can never love too much , " Hilary said quietly , " and God grant you may still be happy . " When Dr. Shane appeared at last , they did not speak as he came toward them . His face showed nothing . " Are you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " It was a whisper . " Well , he certainly gave me the toughest job I 've ever tackled . What is he , Irish ? " " Yes . " Again a whisper with her eyes beseeching . " I thought so . That old-country constitution is going to help him now . I think he 'll pull through . Did you two come in the am-bulance ? " " Yes , we did , " Hilary answered . " I 've got my car . I 'll drop you both off . " " You think he 'll live ? " Mary begged unsteadily . " I think so . He 'll be pretty sick for a few days , but if I 'm not badly mistaken he 'll make a good come-back . There 's no point in your seeing him now . I 've arranged everything . He 'll have good care . You come on home and get to bed . Tomorrow you can come up and have a look at him . " His steady casualness was what was needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar things . They went out to the car . Dr. Shane drove himself , speaking little except to ask directions . When they got to the cheap apartment house , Hilary went inside a moment with Mary. 94 THE BISHOPS MANTLE " You 're sure you 're all right now ? " he asked . She nodded , the tears of her gratitude brimming over . She held his hand tightly in both her own , but could not speak . " Get a good sleep now , " Hilary said . " I 'll try to get over to the hospital soon to see Joe . And please call me at any time if I can help you . " " Mr. Laurens , thank you  --  thank you ! " " That 's all right , Mary . I 'm almost as glad as you are that everythingwent well . Good night ! " He hurried out to the car and got in the front seat . " Of course , " he began , " I realize that it was unforgivable presumptionof me to call you tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a bad mess . I used all the tricks I knew and then some . But I 'm sure I 've got him in decent shape . He has the constitution of an ox , and that ought to do the rest . Who are they ? Friends of yours ? " " This is only the second time I 've laid eyes on them . I married them a few weeks ago  --  my first wedding here . I liked them . Nice boy and girl . He works in a machine shop . She was somebody or other 's maid . She called me tonight in desperation . That 's the story . " " I see , " Shane replied . " And you consider all you 've done tonight in line with your professional duties ? " " Of course , " Hilary said , surprised . " A clergyman responds to a sick call just the same as a doctor , you know . It 's part of the job . " " I do n't believe they all see a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a churchman and f have n't had much dealings with parsons , but you seem to me a different type from the ordinary run . Theoretically you should just come in when the doctor gives up ; but you were on the job first tonight . " Hilary laughed as Shane drew the car to a stop at the rectory . " Pure accident . Seriously though , I ca n't even attempt to thank you for what you did tonight . It was tremendously fine of you to come to our help without a question . Leaving your dinner too ! I shall never forget it . And by the way , will you please send the bill to me ? I 'll arrange for it . " Shane was silent for a moment . " It 's rather a curious thing that the two professions that are supposedto minister to humanity 's needs have so little dealing with each other , is n't it ? Doctors and preachers never seem to hobnob muchTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 95together . I suppose because most doctors do n't go to church and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a heretic out and out , but still I hope we 'll meet again . " " If you should have a free night some time to join me here at the rectory at a bachelor dinner , I should be delighted , " Hilary said . " Fine , " said Shane . " I 'd really like that . " " I 'll call then when I 'm a bit more settled , and see about a date . A thousand thanks again meanwhile for tonight . " " That 's all right , " Shane said , adding gruffly over his shoulder as he started the car , " and there will be no bill . " Hilary ran up the steps and into the house . He was physically tired but his heart was light . It was good to think Dick was here waiting for him . Good to have some one to whom he could pour it all out . Dick was already in the upper hall . " Well , " he remarked , " you look chipper enough . Mother and child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told his story while they smoked in Dick 's room . " Did you ever hear of such consummate cheek on my part ? " Hilary kept asking elatedly . " But the young chap would have died otherwise . Shane as much as intimated that . He 's a great chap , Shane . Says he 's an arch heretic , but I think we 're going to hit it off . Why do I always warm up so to the sinners ? " " My influence , " Dick replied cheerfully . " Say , some old dame called up . I answered the phone and she apparently knows all about me . How come ? She insists upon pouring some tea down my northwestpassage tomorrow afternoon at four . You 're also invited . Name is Sneed or Weed or some such . " " That 's old Mrs. Reed . She 's a real person . I 've told her about you . Of course we 'll go . She 'll eat from your hand . Now , I guess we ought to get to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , you have n't said a thing about your own business . I 've been a swine to talk nothing but my own shop . How 's the mine working out ? " Dick 's black eyes lighted up but he shook his head . " I 'll tell you all tomorrow , " he said . " Just now , Brother Laurens , you should seek your cell . " He stood up , crossed the cords of his bath robe ceremoniously over his abdomen , assumed an air of bland innocence and winked . " Pax vobiscum , " he said , " and do n't snore . " THE BISHOPS MANTLE 97CHAPTER VIDURING DICK 'S VISIT Hilary saw little of him except in the evenings . They went together to Mrs. Reed 's to tea , however . She received them in her little Victorian upstairs sitting room , and , as Hilary had predicted , it was love at first sight between her and Dick . Before the afternoon was over he was telling her one of his best stories and the old lady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could n't resist him . There was one tender moment , also , when she brought out the pictures of her sons and grandson . " Gone , " she said . " All gone , and my life empty . Why should it be so ? But I still say my prayers , " she added , looking at Hilary . " Do you know , " she went on to Dick , " this brother of yours has taken the town by storm ? A parson 's supposed to have morals and bowels of compassion and all that , but this fellow 's got brains too . It 's hard on me . IIe keeps me awake Sundays during the sermon and I 'm not used to it . " When they were leaving she patted them both on the back . " Nice boys , " she said . " Conic to see me , Dick , whenever you 're in town . And you , 1lilary "  --  using his Christian name for the first time  --  " drop in when you want to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever goes any further . " It was the night before Dick left that he made his confession . Hilary had noticed that his eyes looked very bright and there was an excitement in his movements and speech more than his natural restless energy . He had turned off all questions about his business in the city , chiefly , Hilary had supposed , because there was nothing to tell . He had decided Dick had come on now solely to see him in his ne* environment , as he would certainly have done sooner or later . But on their last evening Dick suddenly stopped roaming about the library and faced his brother. 96 " I think I 've hit it at last , Hil . We 've got a mine out there that 's going to pay off . I 'm putting my last shirt into it , and , by the black mare 's tail , I 'm going to be rich this time . " Hilary felt his heart sink . It was not the first time Dick had invested in a mine . His get-rich-quick efforts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried now to answer casually . " You think it 's a good risk ? " " It 's the real thing ! I believe it 's the chance of a lifetime . I 've talked to a couple of fellows here in the city who know copper mines , and they 're keen too . Do you want to come in on it ? " Hilary shook his head . " I do n't believe so . You 're not putting what you got from Grandy in it , are you ? " " I 'd planned to . It 's a dead sure thing , Hil . " " Nothing 's sure in this vain and transitory world . You ought to know that . But you 're of age . You can do as you please , only if I were you I 'd keep some of Grandy 's safe . Sentiment maybe . Ile planned his investments pretty carefully , thinking of us . " Dick 's brows darkened . " I know what you 're driving at . I know I 've backed some wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm pretty excited over it . I did n't mention it before because I knew you 'd preach . But nothing you can say will change me . I know it will pay off . But even if I were n't so sure  --  " Ile laughed , his eyes very black and intense . " I 'd still like the gamble , " he added . " I need a touch of excitement to keep me cheerful . Let me go my own gait , Hil . I will in any case , you know . " " All right , " Hilary said slowly , " but take it as easy as you can . There 's plenty of excitement to be had in this world without risking your last dollar on it . " When they had gone to their rooms , Hilary lay , wakeful . He was deeply disturbed over Dick 's news . It was , however , entirely to be expected . Dick was always impetuous , overenthusiastic , a born gambler . Already on other unlucky ventures he had lost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys from their mother . Now , with Grandy 's fairly considerable estate settled , Dick was once again in possession of funds to invest . Of course , Ililary tried to reason , Dick was thirty , unattached and a free agent . If this sort of thing gave him pleasure , why worry about it ? There was still , however , fresh in his mind , Grandy 's parting request that he should keep an eye on his brother. 98 THE BISHOPS MANTLESuddenly , as a thought struck him , he sprang out of bed . Dick 's light was still on , for he was always a night owl , so Hilary went into his room and sat down on the side of the bed . " Ilow now , 0 righteous one ? " Dick inquired , grinning , as he put down his book and reared up from the pillows . " More sound ad-vice ? " Hilary shook his head . " No , an idea just hit me . You know Grandy 's folks out in Maryville ? Well , I keep thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he said he was planning to go out there this summer . Wanted me to go along . There 's an old cousin of his in the village and a great-nephew on the old farm . I wondered . I ca n't possibly leave here this summer . But we ought n't to lose touch with them . I 'll write of course now and then , but I thought just possibly sometime you were coming through Pittsburgh  --  youget a jerkwater train there or a bus or something . . . " He stopped . Dick 's face had gone serious . " Look , " he said , " I 'll come and preach for you sometime if you want me to , but I 'll be damned if I 'll go out to some forty-second cousin 's farm and visit cows . I hate cows . I would n't know the north side of one from the south . You could n't do this to me , Hilt " " It 's only because Grandy had planned the visit , I thought ... " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted except go and twaddle over pigs and chickens . I ca n't stand yokels . I would n't get oil with them . I 'd bust wide open and shock the livers out of them . " His real distress made Hilary laugh . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I guess you 're right . We 'll let it all ride until sometime I can go myself . I 'd really like to . I was there once with Grandy , you remember , years ago . " " Yes , I did n't want to go even then , so Grandy sent me to camp and took you along . Well , you think then we can leave it at that ? I do n't want to let either you or Grandy down . " " It 's much better this way . I had n't thought the thing through when I spoke . Now , get back to your book . I 'm going to sleep . " " Hil . " " Yes . " " Do n't give up about Lex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . She 's worth waiting for . And so are you , for that matter . " " Thanks , Bib . " It was his childhood nickname for his brother , THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE 99and Hilary was startled to find it suddenly upon his lips after so many years . Perhaps it was loneliness that had brought it forth . It hurt to see Dick go . The following days were so full , however , that he had no time to think of anything except his work . Always , always there was the next sermon to be prepared , and because he was intellectually active , even brilliant , and also because he felt  --  perhaps through a strain of Scotch Presbyterianism in his blood  --  that the sermon was the most important part of the service next to the Sacrament , he poured out upon it the best effort of which he was capable . IIe was surprised now , since he had done little preaching during his Chicago curateship , to discover that instead of having to search for a subject , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes , of texts , jostled each other in his mind , eager for consideration . He was glad of this . He liked this warm rich feeling of mental fertility . But once the idea was chosen , there was hard , gruelling work to be done . For the weight of a perfectionistic compulsion lay upon him . The most difficult thing was to compress all that he wanted to say into twenty minutes . It would be infinitely easier to speak for an hour . The narrow space of time meant ruthless pruning of sentences , continualreadjustment of material , painstaking care in highlighting and emphasis . Then there was all the unexpected work of the priest . Already he had baptized babies at odd hours , married a half dozen strange couples who had drifted in and also a number of parish young people , in addition to officiating at several funerals . In between were the sick calls  --  and the evening dinner parties ! Steadily , though , he was working out his main program of parish work as he expected to lay it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them together for this special meeting until he had grown better acquainted with the parish and also the communityin which St. Matthews was located . Daily his mind revolved around this latter problem . Here stood the great edifice itself , with the rectory and the parish house adjacent . And here also pressing close upon three sides was the poverty of the city . Each noon he walked the streets slowly , sizing up the people and the cheap dwellingswhich housed them . Through his calls upon Joe and Mary McComb he had met some of their neighbors , decent self-respecting people , making the most of their very little . One young woman , aZOO THE BISHOPS MANTLEfriend of Mary 's , he had invited to come to church . She had looked at him in amazement . " Me ? " she said . " Go to St. Matthews ? Why it 's the big bugs ' church . " " It is God 's church , " Hilary had replied . " And you 're welcome there . Mary and Joe are coming . Get your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . One day before Miss Mowbray was back from lunch Hilary suddenlystarted out . He had called the vestry meeting at last for the following week . He wanted very much to present to them some concrete facts on the subject of the surrounding neighborhood . He decided to take a few hours and make a personal canvass of some of the apartments and tenements nearby . His best talking point was the fact that the church itself could be plainly seen from all their windows ; and his clerical vest served as its own introduction . At least , he thought , they wo n't take me for a brush salesman . He had been prepared for strange encounters , and he had them ; but in the main people were courteous , even when apathetic . By four-thirty he was thoroughly tired , but he had now in his possession some information he had very much wanted . Out of three tenements he had visited not a single Protestant family attended church ! Ile walked back , hot , weary , and perspiring , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May . As he turned the corner in sight of the church he was surprised to see Miss Mowbrayon the sidewalk looking up and down the street , her whole bearing one of tenseness and extreme anxiety . As she caught sight of him , she signed frantically for him to hurry , starting herself to meet him . At the same moment Hastings came running down the steps like a wild man , and Morris emerged from the rectory . Hilary 's heart stood still . Was it Lox ? Was it Dick ? What had happened ? " What is it ? " he said when he and Miss Mowbray got close enough to speak . " The wedding ! " she panted . " The Pettigrew wedding at four ! " A cold streak ran up Hilary 's spine . IIe looked at her aghast , unable to speak . " Hurry . We 've got a car waiting and a man from the garage to drive it . I 've got your vestments and Prayer-book in the bag in the car . Hurry . They 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can just make it  --  I 've given the man the directions . . THE BISHOPS MANTLE 101She had grabbed his arm though he needed no urging . They ran the rest of the way and he threw himself into the car . " Step on it , " he said to the driver through his teeth . " This is awful . " He spoke only once again on the way , his eyes glued to the clock . " Can we make it by five ? " " Do my best , Reverend . All depends on the traffic . " The feeling of abject shame which engulfed Hilary seemed to paralyze his very members . The incredible , the unforgivable fact that he had forgotten the wedding stunned him . I-le had been at the rehearsal the night before ; he had thought of the event as he woke up that morning ; the notation regarding it was plainly written on his desk calendar . Heavy beads of perspiration stood on his brow . Why , he must be suffering from a nightmare ! He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden intensity of his new plan to make a personal survey of the tenements , everything outside the actual experience itself had been wiped from his mind . And now , what should he say , what should he do when he got there ? The cab swung at last into the drive on two wheels at five o'clock fiat . The wide beautiful grounds looked festive . A bright marquee for dancing had been erected at the side . Small tables were set under the trees . Men and women in afternoon dress covered the lawns , and stood about on the tall pillared porch . It seemed to Hilary as though every eye centered and froze upon him as he got out of the cab , and clutching his bag , hurried up the steps . Mr. Pettigrew met him , his eyes dark , his face worried , his lips in a forced smile . " Come this way , Mr. Laurens . We 're certainly relieved to see you at last . " IIe nodded to the guests who happened to be near . " Just pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes . " He turned to Hilary . " Everyone was in the house of course at four , but they finally scattered and have been drifting around . What delayed you ? " " I ca n't explain now , " Hilary said . " I 'm desperately sorry . Just show me where I can put on my vestments and I 'll be ready in five minutes . " He could feel the air of anxious , curious tension that still pervadedthe house and overcame the normal pleasant suspense of the102 THE BISHOPS MANTLEmoments before a wedding . From the small bedroom where he changed he could hear Mr. Pettigrew 's flurried orders to the servants and the voice of the professional director just outside in the hall . Tell Miss Pettigrew that Mr. Laurens has come . Tell Mr. Mallory . Tell Mrs. Pettigrew . Tell the bridesmaids . Tell Mrs. Armstrong . ( Hilary knew the latter was the invalid grandmother for whose sake the wedding was a home one . ) Tell the guests to come into the drawing room and be seated . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell the caterer in the kitchen .. . There was confusion . Controlled , but still confusion . He felt his cheeks grow scarlet as he donned his cassock and surplice and adjusted the heavy white silk stole . He snatched a comb from the dresser , ran it through his hair , wiped his dusty shoes at the last moment on his handkerchief which he tossed back into the bag , picked up his Prayer-book and stepped outside in the wide upper hall to announce his readiness . The director was a pleasant , youngish woman with efficiency written all over her . She spoke to him with eyebrows raised . " What in the world happened ? Everybody 's been frantic ! To hold a wedding for over an hour is some job . " " I know . I 'm so desperately sorry . But I 'm ready now . " " Here are Mr. Mallory and the best man . You know the stairway you are to take . I 'll get the rest lined up as soon as you are gone . " The bridegroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked worried and angry . " What happened ? " he said . " It 's a long story , " I , Iilary replied nervously . " I feel as though I could shoot myself if it would do any good . Will the delay upset your plans too much ? " " Well , you see we 're sailing tonight and we had arranged thetime element pretty carefully . It will cut the party short for us , that'ssure . I do n't mind so much but I know Ilelen will . All right , let 's go . " Hilary felt utterly miserable . IIe must tell some one the straighttruth before he left but he had decided to wait and make his confession to Mr. Pettigrew himself . IIe could hear the music below andthe sound of the guests taking their places in the great drawing roomat the end of which an altar had been improvised . The Pettigrews , aside from their wealth , were of the city 's blood royal . The weddingwas a social event of the first water , and Hilary knew that allTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance . He and the groom and the best man were now in the library awaiting their signal . Hilary opened his Prayer-book at the service and the best man checked again on the ring . The groom was nervous and not inclined to talk . Hilary guessed that he might suspect the real fact and could not forgive it . And I certainly do n't blame him , he thought to himself . I never felt like such a heel in my life . At last the signal came and they walked into the drawing room and took their places . As Hilary faced about he was amazed at the size of the company , and at the complete transformation of the room . It looked , indeed , like an exquisite chapel . As he noted each detail , his heart smote him anew that he should have been the one to mar the perfection of the plans . The wedding march began , the bridal procession advanced slowly through the wide doorway from the hall and up the flowerdeckedaisle . At last came Helen , white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment that the bridegroom had taken her hand and they had moved to their places before him that a thought of horror swept through Hilary 's brain . What was the bridegroom 's real name ? They all called him Ted . Was it Theodore or Edward ? He had thought of this last night in bed after the rehearsal and had meant to clear it up just before the wedding . He tried desperately to recall the name upon the license but he could not . As he had looked at it the night before the groom had been talking to him animatedly about their plans for the trip abroad . There was no help for it . With the room in a breathless hush Hilary took a step forward . " What 's your name ? " he whispered as low as he could . The groom glared at him as if this was indeed the last straw . " What ? " he asked huskily . " Your first name ? " Hilary repeated a little louder , horribly consciousthat the strange conversation was now audible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of question and surprise was sweeping the room . " Edward , " the young man answered in a throaty whisper . Within the second , in a voice as rich and sonorous as he could make it , Hilary began the service. 104 THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE " Dearly beloved , we are gathered together here in the sight of Cod and in the face of this company ... " Never had he so exerted every effort in his power to make a wedding service memorably beautiful in the reading . Underneath he prayed wordlessly that his mistakes might somehow be forgiven , and the wedding not completely spoiled . When he came to the last words he knew that the ceremony at least , had been perfect , except for the blundering question and the answer at the beginning . There was now the usual joyful recessional , then the normal confusion of talk and laughter and the gay crowdingof the receiving line . When the champagne was being passed , Hilary saw Mr. Pettigrew coming toward him . " Let 's go into my study for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely . " Now , I 'd like an explanation , " he said . " I believe it is due me . " IIe was still very angry . " It is , " Hilary answered gravely . " I wish I could tell you I was delayed by an accident  --  by anything legitimate . Even then it would be bad enough . But the truth is I forgot it . I was checking up on that section just back of the church , going through those tenements , and  --  " You forgot it ! And you admit it ? " " Yes . I feel utterly wretched . " Pettigrew faced him coldly . " Well , if I had been in your place I would have made up some sort of plausible story and stuck to it . Now , I 've got to do it myself . I 'm not going to have every gossip in the city buzzing that Helen Pettigrew 's wedding was an hour and a half late because the preacher forgot to come . That , I could n't stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll thank you to confirm it when you need to . I want you to leave at once . Then I 'll let it be known that you 're not well . That was the reason you were late . Out making calls , overtired , overworked , seized with sudden faintness  --  God knows what  --  but anyway you came as soon as you could and then left immediately after the ceremony . That will at least sound dignified . And , " he added , his blue eyes scathing , " I 'm not doing this to save your skin , mind you . I damned well do n't care at this moment what happens to you . But I 'm not going to have my daughter 's wedding made a laughingstock . " THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE 105Hilary bowed his head . " You 're probably right , " he said . " She 's our only child . This wedding is not only the biggest thing in her life but in her mother 's and mine as well . We 've planned this for months , spared no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . She and Ted counted on two hours of party after refreshmentsbefore they left . Helen particularly looked forward to that . What girl would n't ? Now , they 'll be lucky if they get one dance . Well , Mr. Laurens , I believe that 's all . Except that I 'll be grateful if you leave at once . " " I 'll wait only to speak to your daughter for a moment . I 've had no chance yet . I wo n't ask any of you to forgive me . I do n't think you ever could . But , believe me , I could n't feel sorrier . " " I 'll have a car at the west porch for you in five minutes , " was Mr. Pettigrew 's only answer . Then , as though the thought had just struck him , he added , " And you even bungled up the service ! It was your business to know Ted 's name beforehand . " Hilary went out into the gay , moving crowd . The bride 's table was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally went over to where she sat . " Mrs. Mallory , may I interrupt you just long enough to say goodbyeand to wish you both the happiest honeymoon any two people ever had ? " She looked up , her eyes overcast for the second . " I 've explained my lateness to your father . I 've never felt so miserable over anything in my life . " She smiled slowly . " You must n't feel so on my wedding day . And you  --  you read the service beautifully . " " Those are the kindest words any one has ever spoken to me . Now , God bless you both ! " Ile shook hands quickly and made his way to the west door , keeping out of sight of people he knew in so far as it was possible . IIe got into the car , realized he was still in his vestments , hurried back to the room , changed and finally left feeling as though all the strength and breath had been knocked out of him . Once back in the rectory he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her the brief details , then he sat in the library with his head in his hands . All Morris ' efforts were in vain . He could eat nothing . The thought of food choked him . IIe began to feel that he must talk to someone , but to whom ? Old Mrs. Reed ? No , not this. 106 THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE . He knew he would accept the offer of her little sitting room as a confession chamber many times as the years went on , but this .. . Suddenly he knew to whom he could confide . Forrest . He of the sensitive face , the wise and gentle voice . " I 'm a good listener , " he had told him that first afternoon . He dialled quickly . Forrest was at home , alone , and would be glad to see him . He left at once . When he entered the blind man 's bachelor quarters he had a distinctfeeling of surprise and pleasure . The rooms were in an old apartment house in a section of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . It was a fourth floor walk-up , but the living room was large and airy with a small iron balcony opening from it , which overlooked a bit of garden . The furniture was good and comfortably shabby by long use . The great piano , a few fine etchings , and a number of unusually good pieces of sculpturegave the room distinction and charm . " This is a great pleasure , " Forrest said , coming to meet him . " I 'll confess I 've been looking forward to this , but I 've never had the courage to ask you . I know what these first months are . Sit over here near the balcony . It 's cooler . " I-Iilary sank down gratefully . There was something about the room which reminded him of the old library at home . " I 'm in trouble , " he said . " I 've made an awful mess of something and I felt I 'd like to talk it over with you . " " You honor me , " Forrest said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead and get it off your chest at once ? " Hilary plunged into the story , telling it in full . When he had finished Forrest did not speak for a long moment . " It is bad , " he said slowly at last . " There 's no use denying it . But I think you must accept it as part of the whole pattern of your ministry . There 's no doctrine , you know , of the infallibility of priests ! You are , after all , a man like unto other men . You will of necessity make mistakes . And I 'm not so sure  --  " He stopped , half smiling , one thin hand supporting the sensitivelythoughtful face . " Will you forgive me if I make a strange statement ? I was about to say that as far as you yourself are concerned I 'm almost glad this has happened . " THE BISHOPS MANTLE 107 " Why ? " The word fairly burst from Hilary . " Well , there is one Biblical woe which most people do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men shall speak well of you . ' But as far as I have been able to gather you 've been in just that position . You 've made a phenomenally good impression . Your praises are sung everywhere . " " And you think this is dangerous ? " " I think you have been singularly untouched by it , but perhaps a big mistake such as this may preserve a certain needed balance . Please do n't hate me for saying this . " " On the contrary , " Hilary said slowly , " I think you may be right in principle . But you see , if Pettigrew tells everyone I was sick , I still wo n't be blamed as far as the congregation in general is con-cerned . " " But you 'll have to forgive yourself . That 's often harder than forgiving other people . You 'll have to live with this mistake and accept your own limitations along with your own great powers . And you can be sure there will be one family at least who wo n't be speaking well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sure of that . " " I hope you wo n't think I 'm brutal in saying what I have . " " No , " Hilary said slowly . " You sound very like my grandfather . I believe that 's exactly what he might have said . I hope you 'll believe me though when I tell you that the reason this thing has hit me so hard is not because I 'm afraid of the effect on myself , but because I realize I have made a number of people very unhappy . To have spoiled a wedding for all involved  --  that makes me wretched beyond words . And there is something else , too . " " Tell me , " said Forrest . " Well , it 's hard to explain because I 'm a bit confused myself . You see , in Chicago I was merely a curate . I was learning my trade , as it were , doing what I was told . My responsibility to the  --  outside world , shall we call it ?  --  did n't strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit me full in the face . All those tenements just back of the church . All the people working in the factories and lofts around it . The city ! The city ! It beats upon me . I feel the whole weight of it . I 've got to do something about it . I 've got to reach out to it , serve it , somehow  --  " He broke off . Forrest still sat with his hand against his cheek , 108 THE BISHOPS MANTLEhis eyes closed , but his whole face seemed to change , to become animated . " The city ! " he repeated . " The ultimate unit of society . The concentratedessence of civilization . It 's the city that lives after the nation has fallen . I ca n't see it with my eyes , but I feel it with all my other senses . I could n't be happy out of it . It intoxicates me , stimulates me  --  all of it . " Hilary watched him , surprised . He had thought of Forrest as the deeply contemplative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country if he could have had it . " I know what you mean , though , " the older man went on , " about the tragic cry of the city . I get my secretary to take me for long walks in the slums , down along Water Street . Once we went to the Redeemer Mission . You ought to go some time . It 's an experience . I go in order to get deeper tones into my music , something of the poor , wretched , suffering souls of men . " " That 's it , " Hilary broke in eagerly . " I was so full of zeal to help them that today I forgot my first duty , which is to St. Matthews . I 've got to be very careful to serve my own people first . I 've got to realize that rich people can be as unhappy as poor people . In other words I 've got to restrain a lot of my first impulses because of this afternoon 's experience . " " I think I see what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discouragedover that . " IIe smiled . " You may have to revise your plans still more after your vestry meetings . Ease into things gradually . That 's not cowardice . It 's merely good sense and efficiency in the long run . IIow about an assistant ? " " I must find one soon . So far I 've been trying to get my own bearings . But I 'm ready now to start the search . Any suggestions ? " Forrest hesitated . " I have one but I am biased at the outset . The man is an old friend . " " Really ? " said Hilary . " That 's a recommendation in itself . Tell me about him . " " Well , " said Forrest , " it 's a long story . He 's from a little town in the middle west and his wife still is , if you get what I mean . That 's been his trouble . A boy and girl romance to which he held , by conscience or a sense of chivalry , I fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's grown , she has n't . He 's got a little church now somewhere in upper New York state where all his talents areTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 109wasted . He would fit into this place perfectly , I feel sure . But while she can run a mother 's meeting or a cake sale with one hand she would n't be socially acceptable to St. Matthews . Do you see the picture ? " " Yes and it interests me , " Hilary said slowly . " How old is he ? " " He 's all of sixty ; so is she but neither of them look it . " " Would he care to be an assistant to a younger man ? " Forrest 's expression told more than his words . " He has not had much chance to develop pride during the years . I do n't believe that thought would even cross his mind . He loves beauty . To serve before the altar of St. Matthews in any capacity would be to him , I imagine , the great fulfillment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me think . First of all , practical and utterly devoid of imagination . Voice too loud with a good many little provincialisms of speech . No social graces but a heart of gold . There 's one thing more I must tell you about him , though . Two or three times during the years , he 's gotten drunk . And he does n't drink , mind you . " In spite of himself Hilary laughed . " He does n't drink , he just gets drunk ! " " That 's it in a nutshell . He definitely does not drink , in the usual sense . Never did even before he took orders . What has happened is this : his whole life has been one long frustration ; several times when he felt completely hopeless he shut himself in his study with a bottle of Scotch and finished it . Twice by devilish ill luck he was discovered . Of course people thought the worst , though I will say they tried to keep it quiet . Both times , though , he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that could never be condoned . " " You think it could be here , for example ? " " I do n't think it would ever happen here . If , conceivably , he were to come here as your assistant , he would have constantly the kind of contacts , the kind of outlet for his resources , which he has always craved . Do n't you see ? I could almost guarantee there would be no problem there , though of course I had to give you all the facts . And , I 'm sure he and you would take to each other . I 've thought of it often since you came but hesitated  --  Tonight seemed the perfect opportunity to tell you about him . " Hilary sat thoughtful for some minutes . " In many ways I wouldTHE BISHOPS MANTLElike an older man . I hate the thought of breaking in a young one . This set-up , if it should work out , would give our ministry a sort of balance . And as to the woman  --  I 'm not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to downy church work ? " " Good heavens , yes ! That would be just the trouble . She 's the hearty , efficient kind , born to run country-church suppers and pack missionary barrels . But as you know , St. Matthews does n't need just those qualifications . " Hilary drew slowly upon his pipe . " I 'm not so sure about that , " he repeated . " I have some plans in mind where she might possibly fit in . How can I see these people ? " " I 'll ask them down for a night . I often do as a matter of fact . It seems to give him a lift . I 'll not drop even a hint of what we 've talked about . I 'll just take him over to the study because I want him to meet you . Then you can size him up . If you want to see her , we can manage that too . I do n't want to press this , remember , or lay any sort of obligation upon you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I understand . It 's something to think about though . I 'm grateful for even the possibility . Now I must n't keep you up any longer . You 've helped me tonight as I 'm sure no one else could . I ca n't ever thank you . " Forrest only smiled . " It was wonderfully nice of you to come . How about something to cat before you go ? Katy always leaves a pretty full icebox . Let 's go forage . " " By George , " said Ililary , " I 've just remembered I had no dinner ! I could n't eat when I got back from the wedding . It 's not fair to raid your icebox tinder those conditions . " Forrest laughed and led the way . Hilary marvelled at his ease . With perfect assurance he moved about the kitchen , reaching one article and another as though by sight . They sat down at last with a tray of sandwiches between them . " By the way , what is the name of this man , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stupid of me not to mention it . Samuel Adams . And she "  --  he paused , smiling  --  " she is Samantha ! " Hilary rolled the name upon his tongue . " If they should ever come I know I 'd call her Aunt Samantha . " " She would love it , " Forrest said . " But she would try to bossTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 111you , make you wear rubbers , and smell camphor for a cold . I warn you . " " But she 's kind . " Forrest 's expression was strange . " She 's the kindest person I know , " he said . When Hilary got back at last to the rectory , Morris was waitingup . " Mist ' Hilary , you all right ? " " Fine , Morris . I was tired and worried , but I 've got my second wind now . " " Lots of people callin ' up tonight askin ' how you is . " Hilary stopped dead with his foot on the stair . He had not foreseenthis contingency . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you feelin ' poorly . " " Did you say I was out ? " " No , Mist ' Hilary , I just say you feelin ' poorly . I mind once the Bishop tell me that was the safest if I was n't sure , ' cause folks could always get well quick if they needed to . " Hilary laughed . " Good ! That will be the way with me . Tomorrow if any one calls just say I 'm feeling a little better and am at the study . By the way , do you think you could manage a dinner party for me some night ? " The change in the old colored man was electrical . His shrunken shoulders straightened ; life came back into his eyes ; his lips trembled with eagerness . " Dinner party ? Now , Mist ' Hilary there 's nothin ' do me as much good as cookin ' a dinner for comp'ny . How many folks ? " " Oh , eight or ten , perhaps . I 'll tell you in a few days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a good fellow ! " At the top of the stairs he heard Morris speaking excitedly . " Mist ' Hilary , you forgot something . That 's why I know this afternoon you feelin ' mighty low . " He was coming up the stairs as fast as his stiff knees could bring him . Hilary saw then the silver tray in his hand with a letter upon it . A letter from Lex ! He grasped it , grinning his thanks , and took the rest of the stairs two at a time . How could he have missed it ? Morris , having been told nothing , yet with the instinct of his race for knowing everything , always propped her letters ostentatiously , as they came , upon the hall110112 THE BISHOPS MANTLE table . Hilary 's eyes sought the spot each day as he came through the door , hopefully , fearfully . Tonight in his deep distress of mind he had not even noticed . He opened it now and read it through swiftly , then sitting down , read it slowly again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll note . Muff is sick in bed with tonsillitis and I might as well be , for she gets in a state every time I go out alone . We 're at a very elegant but very quiet little hotel just near the Crillon . Too near , for I can get tantalizing glimpses of the gaiety there and feel horribly shut out of it . Scores of hand- some and distinguished-looking males pass in and out the portals . Any day now I shall drop my hanky at the feet of one of them and allow myself to be persuaded to have lunch or tea with him . Beyond that  --  " Oh , my dear Monsieur , how could you so misjudge me !

So do n't tell her  --  yet . As to your other question , I can only say this . I 've never thought so hard about anything in my life as I am now every day about us .

He walked into it slowly as he had done on his first day , and knelt before the altar . For a few minutes the happeningsof the afternoon and evening passed fluidly through his mind . The tenements he had visited , with their poor , drab inhabitants ; the luxurious beauty of the Pettigrew wedding which his own forgetfulness had so grievously marred ; his call upon Forrest and the strange problem of Samuel and Samantha Adams ; now the letter from Lex and his own aching , longing heart . His head fell upon his hands and he prayed . THE BISHOPS MANTLE 115CHAPTER VIITHE NEXT MORNING at seven , before he was dressed , Hilary heard Hastings ' voice in the hall below . This boded no good . He got into his clothes quickly and went down . The old verger waited in fhe dining room , his lean face melancholy as usual , a bunch of newspapersin his hand . " What 's up , Hastings ? " Hilary asked anxiously . " I just thought you 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the house . " Hilary grabbed the papers , all opened and folded at the account of the Pettigrew wedding . The conservative ones ran the familiar headings , but did not fail to mention the unusual fact of the ceremony'sdelay due to the sudden illness of the rector of St. Matthewsjust prior to the hour . The tabloids , however , ran riot : " Sudden Illness of Rector Delays Fashionable Wedding ! . . . St. Matthews ' Rector Suffers Heart Attack . . . . Pettigrew-Mallory Nuptials an Hour . Late Due to Clergyman 's Seizure . " IIe read them all and groaned . " ' Bout the best you could do , I s'pose , " Ilastings was remarkingjudicially . " My father used to say , Tell a whopper when you have to an ' then stick to it . ' " " But , Hastings , " I-lilary burst out , " do n't think I made up this excuse . I told Mr. Pettigrew the absolute truth , of course . He felt it sounded too undignified to give out , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm it if I needed to . Now I am in a jam . I never thought of the papers taking it up . " " So that 's the way it was , " Ilastings said , his bleak gray eyes softening . " Me an ' Miss Mowbray just wondered . Now you listen . You get right back up to your room an ' stay there . It wo n't hurt you to rest up a day or so after tearin ' round like mad the way you 've been doin ' . Miss Mowbray can bring the mail over an ' do it here . I 'll take care of the phone over at the study , an ' this heregentleman , " indicating Morris , " can do the same here . We 're in this thing now , an ' we 've got to see it through . " " I 'll have to lie doggo today , at least , I suppose , " Hilary agreed slowly , " but I hate all this like poison . " Hastings was scratching his bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attack business . That ai n't good for a new preacher . Every Sunday now , the old ladies ' 11 all be lookin ' for you to keel over in the pulpit . We got to think you up some other disease . I s'pose , " he said apologetically , " you would n't want me to say something had disagreed with you . " Hilary laughed , but without much mirth . " I feel so low that a little more embarrassment would n't matter much . Wait a min-ute . " He jumped up quickly and went to the telephone . It was only seven-thirty . He might be able to catch Shane before he left the house . Luck had been with him once before . It was again . In a few seconds he heard Shane 's voice . " This is Hilary Laurens , doctor . I 'm always asking favors , I fear . " " What 's this I see in the morning papers about you ? How are you ? " " Too well , considering the write-ups . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rectory for a few minutes ? It 's a lot to ask you . " " Are you sure I 'm the doctor you want ? I can give you the name of the best heart specialist in the city . " " You 're the very one I want , if I can get you . " " I 'll be over in about ten minutes on my way to the hospital , " he said . Hilary told Hastings to wait , and went back up to his room . He had never felt so thoroughly uncomfortable and ashamed . Morris , always delighted at any excuse for a tray , brought him up his breakfast and insisted upon hanging up his coat and helping him into a dressing gown . The most remarkable fact of all was that , once relaxed in his chair , he felt inexpressibly weary and willing to stay there . When Shane came , he told him the facts . " You see I 'm in for it for a decent interval at least . But as Hastingsdown there has just pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that I 've had a heart attack . What reasonable disease can I have and recover from quickly ? " Shane listened to his chest . " Much athletics in college ? " " Track . " " Sounds like it . No real trouble , though , if you use common sense . You look pretty tired to me . Give me an idea of your routine . " " Oh , up at seven or before . At the study by a quarter to eight . Mail first , then work on my sermon . Calls all afternoon . Dinner parties most nights . If it 's not too late after that , some reading or study . Of course in between all this the usual number of weddings and funerals and callers . " Shane nodded . " Pretty full schedule . Well , just to ease your conscience I 'll tell you you 're a pretty tired young man , and I prescribe two days in bed for you . We 'll call it grippe . Good old grippe . Heart not affected in the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a brick . But I hate this whole dissembling business . I should never have gotten into it but I felt so ashamed of myself and so sorry for the Pettigrews . But it 's bad . I have a sort of fanatical regard for the truth . And this thing is nauseating to me . " " Ali , " said Shane , " we 'll have to have a talk about truth some time . One of my pet topics . When does the moral worth of an ultimate good take precedence over adherence to the present fact ? Where in the field of ethics does pragmatic lying fit in ? Do doctors and preachers come to a line where they have to lie about a thing in order to make it come true ? I 've often said to a sick man You 're going to get well , ' when I was certain sure he was n't . Then , damn me , if he did n't up and recover , making me a liar if I 'd told what I believed before to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you preachers run into the same thing . " Shane slapped him on the shoulder . " Now take it easy . I 'll leave a prescription . You definitely need the rest . Oh , by the way , let 's have a look in your throat . By George , it is a bit red . Wonderful ! Gargle with salt water , take your tonic and keep to your room , for two days . Let me know if you run into more trouble . Well , goodbye . " He was off before Hilary could more than thank him . The fact that now he had some justification for his rest made116 THE BISHOPS MANTLETHE BISHOPS MANTLE 117him relax completely . He realized under what a terrific emotional and physical strain he had been working for weeks . Now that he had let go , he felt limp . As he glanced at the bed he could think of nothing more desirable than crawling back into it and sleeping for a whole day . He went to the door and called Hastings , who came up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good shape an ' no foolin ' . You go at things hammer an ' tongs . I 've told you well of it , mind . You 've got to slow up . Now you stay here an ' behave yourself an ' me an ' Miss Mowbray , we 'll run things . What about the mail ? " The old man 's solicitude made his voice harsh . " Now listen , Hastings . Do n't get excited . I am pretty tired and the doctor says I have a red throat . I 'm going to turn in again and sleep all day . Tomorrow morning I 'll be down in the library , and Miss Mowbray can bring all the mail over and we 'll handle it here . And on the phone just say the doctor calls it grippe and the heartattackstory was a mistake . I know you 'll be diplomatic . O.K. ? " " O.K. , " Hastings said suspiciously . " But you 're sure you 're not sicker than you let on ? " " Absolutely . Now run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , and ask Miss Mowbray to check my calendar and be sure I 'm not forgetting anything else . " When I-Iastings was gone , there was still Morris to reassure ; then Hilary went back to bed . " An ' I 'll catch the phone , Mist ' Hilary , ' fore it 's got time to peep up here . " He did not wake until four o'clock in the afternoon , then lay for a moment looking across at the gray stone cornices of the church roof where pigeons were ruffling their lavender and gold feathers in the sun . Below , the stained glass of one of the side windows dimly caught the afternoon light . There was in this room , as he had felt from the first , a certain atmosphere of withdrawal from the world  --  a sort of monastic seclusion . All the city was shut away ; there was no view from his bed except the stained glass , the weathered gray stone and the cooing pigeons ; if he rose and went closer to the window there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as though , like the young Samuel of old , he was dwelling in the very temple118 THE BISHOPS MANTLEitself . I 'll always keep this room , he thought to himself , very simple and plain . It will rest me when I get too tired . For he felt rested now already . He got up and dressed and went downstairs . Even on the landing his nose detected a heavy , unnatural fragrance . When he got to the foot of the stairs he stopped aghast . " Good heavens ! " he exclaimed to himself . " Am I dead and do n't know it ? " For the library seemed filled with flowers . Even at the moment Morris came from the pantry regions bearing two more vases . " Mist ' Hilary , I ai n't done nothin ' all clay but answer the phone an ' take in flowers . It 's been like when the Bishop  --  I mean there 's more here than you really need ' ceptin ' at a funeral . " " To put it conservatively , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cards which Morris had carefully placed under each bouquet . " These here , Mist ' Hilary , " he said now , pointing to a huge bunch of red roses , " these here is something mighty special . Lady bring ' em herself an ' leave this note . She ask inc all kinds of questionshow you is . " Hilary took the heavy square envelope and opened it . It read : DEAR MR . LAURENS : I am deeply concerned over your sudden illness . Is there anything I could possibly send you or do for you ? You have no idea how nuicli you have helped me alreadyand I am most eager to show my gratitude . As soon as you are able will you come in again to tea and perhaps let me tell you more of my problems ? Lonelinessis , of course , still the greatest , but that I suppose I must endure . Your sympathy and guidance have helped so much . I shall call up tomorrow and hope for the good news that you are better . With deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilary , as Dick 's wicked quotation about widow ; , came to his mind . He thrust it aside , though , as unworthy . " Lots of folks call up this mornin ' , then the flowers come this afternoon , " Morris kept explaining . " I got all the names here on a paper . " THE BISHOPS MANTLE 119 " Good fellow ! Let me have it , will you ? Then take some of these out , Morris . Put them anywhere . I ca n't stand so many round me . " The list surprised him . There were the names of those whom he already regarded as friends : old Mrs. Reed , the Coles , others of the vestry . But there were many he did not even recognize . Morris wrote fairly plainly if shakily , but there was one name he puzzled over . At last he made it out . It was Francine Avery . He had not spoken to her in ordinary conversation since the talk in his study on that bleak , rainy afternoon . But every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communion . He was intending to give her a little more time and then urge her to become confirmed . Now , she too had called up . It strangely warmed his heart . He ate dinner with relish and then settled down in the library to write to Lex . Phone calls still came at intervals but Morris answered , as Hilary noted , with firmness and great discretion . LEX DARLING : Each time I start to write you all the details of my doings I find myself wanting to say only one thing . I love you . I want you . I do n't know how to live without you . So consider that as the substance of this letter and the rest unimportant . Relatively , I mean . Here 's what happened yesterday , though . The Pettigrew-Mallory wedding was set for four . I clean , absolutely , abysmally forgot it ! I got there , only by grace of Miss Mowbray and Hastings and a dare-devil taxi driver , at five , hot , dishevelled and wishing I could jump in the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made up a tale I was sick and the papers got hold of it . I 've stayed in today for looks ' sake and the whole parish has sent flowers and I feel like a heel . Now if you had been my wife , dearest , it could n't have happened . You 'd have been talking all through lunch about the wedding and what you were going to wear ! Everything only leads to this : I love you with my very soul . When you love me too , how can you be afraid ? How can you hesitate ? There can be no .. . Morris appeared in the doorway . " It 's that Mrs. Downes , Mist ' Hilary , on the phone . The one120 THE BISHOPS MANTLEthat brought the big red roses . She say can she please speak to you . She plead mighty hard . " " I suppose so , " Hilary said slowly , as he rose . Diana Downes ' voice was husky and tender with anxiety . " Mr. Laurens ? This is good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about you , for I 've thought for the last two Sundays you looked very tired . Are you really better ? " " Oh , much , thank you . The doctor says a few days ' rest will be all I need . Thank you for the gorgeous roses . It was most kind of you . " " I 've called you several times before but never found you in . I 'm loath to speak of myself now but I am really  --  frightened . You helped me before . Could you possibly stop in again  --  next week perhaps  --  if you are able ? Could you ? Any afternoon would suit me . " Hilary knit his dark brows . " Next week is very full for me , Mrs. Downes . " IIe hesitated , and she said nothing at all , which made it harder to refuse . " Perhaps on Thursday I could run in for a few minutes around five . " " Oh , that 's so good of you ! And do he careful now . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Her voice broke off gently . " I shall expect you next Thursday then , at five , and thank you so very much . " Hilary returned to his letter in a baffled mood . He hated himself for doubting this woman , and yet he did . He had barely put pen to paper when Morris appeared again . " It 's Mr. Forrest , Mist ' Hilary . He say he think you 'd want to speak to him . " " Of course . " IIe jumped up quickly . " Hello , Mr. Forrest . I should have called you before . I 'm ashamed to say I 've been asleep all day . The queer part is I actually seemed to need it . Thanks again for last night . " " It 's about the Adamses I wanted to speak to you , " Forrest said . " I began to feel that since you 're interested no time should be wasted in at least bringing about a meeting . The rest , of course , is entirely up to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's perhaps been through a bad time again . He jumped at my invitation to come down . I insisted he bring Samantha , too . He often comes alone but I told him I thought she needed a change . So they 're both cornTHEBISHOPS MANTLE 121ing next Monday . What time should I bring Sam over to the study ? " " Between three and four ? Then you could leave us together while you are at the organ . " " Fine . Now get to bed , and rest some more . You sounded last night as though you needed it . " " Thanks , I will . I have an optimistic hunch about the Adamses , somehow . " " ' Well , of course I hope something may come of it . But do n't feel in any way bound . Goodbye . " Hilary finished his letter and sat thinking of the coining week . He could not reassure himself that its manifold duties were unusual . Such weeks in general would be his constant and familiar fare , though the details would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make concerning the Adamses ; the problem of Diana Downes ; the specially called meeting of the vestry for Friday night which he had decided to turn into a dinner ; two other important dinner engagements which he dreaded and yet had felt constrained to accept ; in addition to all of which was the constant overhanging weight of the weekly sermon , the urgent sick calls upon those near to death 's door , probably an unexpected funeral or two . . . So it went . So it would continue to go . If he and Lex were actually married , could he shake off all this weight of responsibility , this bearing of the burdens of others , and be a normal companion to her ? It would not be fair to load upon her also the troubles of a parish . And yet he knew he would crave desperately the relief of sharing them with her  --  all but the secrets , such as Francine Avery 's . All , well , the first great anxiety was still whether she would marry him at all . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance , he felt sure . With his thoughts full of her and with a sudden optimism born of rested nerves he finally went up to his room . The next day he slept late and woke feeling better than he had for weeks . At the big desk in the library he and Miss Mowbray wrestled throughout the morning with the accumulated mail . Invitationsto speak at all sorts of affairs were pouring in . These Hilary considered seriously . It was essential that he assume his position in the city and accept his responsibility toward its varied life . But he knew also how easily his time and energy could be frittered122 THE BISHOP 'S MANTLEaway upon trifling occasions . He armed himself against the insidious flattery inherent in each request and finally declined all except the invitation to address a group of theological graduates in June . Next fall and winter , he reasoned , when he was securely established he could perhaps do more speaking , for he knew he had the gift for it . As they worked in the unwonted intimacy of the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her homeliness of feature became subordinated to her warm , friendly personality . Her voice , as he had noted on their first meeting , was at one with Cordelia 's own . Her laughter was pleasant . She had both wit and wisdom ; and all about her clung a sweet-scented freshness of person and clothing . She 's made the most of herself , Ililary thought as he eyed her once . It became easy , when you were with her for a time , to forget entirely her lack of beauty . He especially liked her smoothlybrushed ash-blond hair and her strong , white hands . " I had a special phone call for you today , " she said suddenly . " It was from Miss Celeste Barton of the Varny Street Settlement . " " Oh , yes ? " " She 's a remarkable person . You 'll enjoy knowing her . I think I 've never admired a woman as much as I do her . She would like to meet you some clay soon either at your study or at the settlement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlap . " " I see . " " She 's doing a wonderful work there . She 's given her life to it . She comes of an old lam fly , and she 's so beautiful she could have had anything . " There was a certain wistfulness in Miss Mowbray 's voice . " But she chose to do this . They call her the Angel of Varny Street . " " Does she belong to St. Matthews ? " " Yes , but she never comes except to eight o'clock Communion . She 's always so busy  --  " Hilary sat up suddenly . " How old is she ? " " Oh , in the fifties , I should say . But she 's slender and looks younger . " " Then that 's the one ! " At Miss Mowbray 's look of surprise he explained . " I 've watched her Sunday after Sunday at the altar and wondered who she was . THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE 123Let 's make an appointment for week after next . This coming one is too full , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . " The last letter Hilary dictated was to Francine Avery . DEAR MISS AVERY : I have watched you with deep thankfulness at the early service each Sunday . It has seemed to me that you have found peace . I do not wish to hurry you in any way , but as soon as you feel like it I should be glad to talk over with you the steps leading to confirmation . There are many reasons why you should consider this seriously . Meanwhile , please accept my admiration for your honesty and courage and my sincere wish to be of service to you in any way possible . Faithfully yours , " Now , I think that 's all , " he said . " I 'm afraid I 've worked you very hard this morning . " She gathered up her papers . " I enjoy it , " she said , smiling . " For sheer variety I 'm sure a clergyman 's mail must rival a movie star 's . You 're certain you 're all right again ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer mess , but out of it I have picked up a little rest . I 've never really thanked you enough for getting me off in the cab that day  --  packing my vestments and all that . You certainly saved what small shred of reputation was left me . It was all pretty bad , was n't it ? " She looked into his eyes . Her own were soft . " Do n't worry . In a very little while everyone will forget about it . " " Even the bride and groom ? " " Most of all the bride and groom , I should think , " she laughed . " Well , I 'll be at the office as usual then , tomorrow . And do rest up today . " When she had gone Hilary reflected upon his good fortune in having her services . Her efficiency and quiet kindliness constantly encouraged him . Yes , fate had been gracious in giving him Margaret Mowbray . Early the next morning Mrs. McColly called up , perturbed and anxious . She had been out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding and the supposed heart attack . Hilary allayed her fears and promised willingly to take dinner there on Sunday . The thought buoyed him up during the intervening time , 124 THE BISHOPS MANTLE but when he finally entered the house , the emptiness of it struck him like a dart . He told all his story and then the conversation turned at once to Lex . " I do n't like her prowling around Europe this summer , " Old Alex said . " You know what I think ? There 's going to be war over there by fall " " Do n't pay any attention to him , Hilary . He 's a male Cassandra if there ever was one . War is unthinkable . " " Tell that to that German jackass . I 've had reports . I 've got agents over there . And I was talking to a newspaper man who 's been over . Those fellows know . They do n't bet whether there 'll be a war or not . They bet on the month it 's goin ' to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put some pressure on her , Hilary ? " Hilary 's expression was pure amazement . " War , " he said . " Why , I 've never even taken the thought seriously . What grounds have you for being so alarmed ? " " Grounds ? Good God , man , do n't you read the papers ? These last two months have pretty nearly told the story . Middle of March Hitler takes over all that 's left of Czechoslovakia . Does he stop there ? Like hell he does . He 's in Lithuania in a week . The Italians are bombing Albania without warning in another week . Chamber- lain announces conscription in England . This all mean anything to you ? I want Lex home . " IIer mother sighed softly . " She 'll come when she gets ready , and not before . You should know that by this time , Alex . Besides , I think you are ridiculously wrought up over this . Lex has made her plans to go to the Riviera for a month and then to Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure . " " And I do n't like that mountain climbing business , either , " Old Alex growled . " Put some pressure on her , Ililary . " " I 'm not quite in a position to do that , I 'm afraid , " Hilary said , smiling . " Well , I hope you soon will be , " Alex said bluntly . " You do n't hope it as much as I do , " Hilary answered . Then they all laughed together , forgetting other talk . Lex , only Lex , was the subject and in the close circle of their common love they seemed to bring her near . On Monday Hilary felt a nervousness overtake him as the time approached three . Fortunately Forrest was prompt . Miss Mowbray ushered the two men in on the stroke of the hour . Forrest took charge . " Mr. Laurens , I want to introduce an old friend of mine , Samuel Adams . I thought you two good parsons should know each other . He and his wife are my guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet you . " " This is good of you , " Hilary said , shaking hands . " I 'm glad to meet you , Mr. Adams . Sit down . " " I feel almost acquainted with you , " Adams returned , " for I was a deep admirer of the Bishop , your grandfather . " " You knew my grandfather ? " " I had the pleasure of meeting him at church conventions and of once long ago serving on a committee under him . And of course I 've read all his books . He was a great man . " Hilary 's face had lighted . " Nothing could make me feel as close to you as for you to say just that . " Forrest had risen . " Would you two like to talk a while ? I 'll go down to the organ and when you 're ready , Sam , come on down . " When he was gone , Hilary faced his guest with eager interest . He saw a man , younger looking than sixty , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes and a kindly mouth encased in lines worn there by hopelessness . " You have a fine church here , " Adams was saying , " the most beautiful one I know . " " I feel the same way . I 'm still new and completely swamped with work . Maybe from your longer experience you can give me some advice . Just now it 's the Parish House work that I must plan . I have some rather definite and perhaps not too popular ideas on the subject . " " As it happens , so have I , " Adams responded , smiling , " though I 've never had a chance to use them . " " Come on , then . Let 's air them together . " As they talked , Hilary knew that he wanted this man if he could get him . Adams was intelligent , even scholarly . While hesitant at first , a growing confidence came into his voice as he forgot himself and discussed the problems of St. Matthews . IIilary was quick to note that , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied human nature to good purpose where he had been . He126 THE BISHOPS MANTLEhad a sympathetic heart , Hilary was sure , and  --  perhaps a small thing by comparison and yet important in its own way  --  a naturally deep , fine , resonant voice . In addition to all other considerations , and in a way topping them , was Adams ' acquaintance with and admiration for Grandy . That would be a sound bond between them . At the end of an hour Hilary made a quick decision . I 'm going to take a chance on Aunt Samantha , he thought . This man 's qualitieswill surely outweigh any difficulties with her , and I 'm going to speak out right now . " Mr. Adams , " he said , " I 'm desperately in need of an assistant . I believe you and I would be congenial and could work together . Would you consider coming to St. Matthews in that capacity ? " IIe was completely unprepared for the effect on the man before him . Adams stared at him , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last he rose and walked to the window . He stood , his back to Hilary , looking down at the court , still without speaking . " You may not be interested at all , " Hilary went on , embarrassed . " I have rather blurted out the suggestion , and you will want time to think it over . We can go into it more in detail tomorrow if you care to  --  the salary , etc . " Adams turned at last . his face was still an anguished white . He looked like a drowning man disappearing for the third time . " I ca n't thank you enough for the offer . There is nothing I should like so much to do as to accept . But for certain reasons I can not . " Before the sharp tragedy of his face the words sounded blunt and almost casual . Ifilary 's respect for him deepened . " If , knowing the possible reasons for your refusal , I still begged you to accept , would that change your attitude ? " Hilary asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was tense . " Has Forrest talked to you ? " " Yes . " " He told you  --  everything ? " " Everything . I repeat , I hope you will come to St. Matthews . " Adams turned again to the window . Hilary guessed he was struggling for control . He himself had a hot sense of shame and indecency as though he were looking at a man 's naked soul . At last Adams came back and sat down . His eyes were wet . THE BISHOPS MANTLE 127 " To serve here at St. Matthews with you would be to me the greatest possible joy . And for myself , since you evidently know my  --  disability , I would accept at once . But there is still the question of whether my wife would care for city life . " He spoke slowly , with meticulous respect for her , Hilary noted . " You see , she has been accustomed to the work of small-town and rural parishes . She might not  --  There is a great difference , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we can all talk it over . " He was leaving them all a loophole , Hilary saw , and liked him for it . " Good . I have a dinner engagement tonight , and no doubt you are busy too ; but if you could drop in tomorrow afternoon at this time I 'll be delighted to meet Mrs. Adams . Would n't you like to have a look around the building ? You should see what you 're getting into before you decide , you know . " When they had completed their survey of the Parish House they returned to the church . Hilary turned on the chancel lights and together they stood looking up at the altar . Forrest 's music came to them softly like the brushing of angels ' wings . Hilary held his breath in sudden fear , but Adams did not fail him . He remained silent . No casual secularity , no fatuous exclamations of beauty . When the moment was passed , Hilary said goodbye quietly and left . There was no doubt about it , Adams was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculations . I would put up with a good deal of Samantha , Hilary found himself muttering with a smile , for the sake of Samuel . That night he was to dine at the Breckenridges ' . It was a thrice postponed event giving it to Hilary in advance a warmed over effect . Besides this , he was afraid of this meeting with Lex 's aged relatives , spinster and bachelor , Miss Hettie and Mr. Edward . He had been at the point of asking Mrs. McColly for some advice the day before but had thought better of it . So , armed now with nothing more encouragingthan old Mrs. Reed 's early comment and Lex 's recent one , he set out for the house , which he found ponderously elegant and dark , throwing a prophetic shadow over the evening . Miss Hettie , spare , aquiline , patrician , rose to greet him from a tall chair by the fireside . It was not only that her skinny hands were icy , there was a sort of frozen virginity about her whole person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her brother was a small man , evidently dominated completely by her  --  the White Rabbit , as Lex always referred to him . Any moment , Hilary thought to himself , he will say : " Oh , my ears and whiskers ! How late it 's getting ! " So pleased was he by this idea that he did not quite catch Miss Hettie 's remark . " I beg your pardon , " he said hastily . " I was saying that your rectorship though brief so far has been marked by very distinguished success . " " I appreciate your feeling so . " " I trust , as time goes on , this success will mount . Those of us who have been pew/holders in St. Matthews for thirty years and more , naturally hold her interests very close to our hearts . " " Naturally , " Hilary echoed , feeling uncomfortably that this was a lead-up to something . Dinner progressed , in spite of all his own efforts , with an exchange of chilly banalities . Underneath , he felt Miss Nettie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton structure . Something about him , he felt sure , ( lid not please her in spite of her praise . IIe tried to engage her brother 's attention ; but Mr. Edward deferred constantly to his sister . At last , back in the drawing room ( where the chariot wheels of conversation had still dragged heavily ) shortly before Hilary took his leave , the bombshell dropped . " I believe , " Miss nettle said with measured calm , " that you are acquainted with my great-niece , Alexa McColly . " Hilary was so completely taken back that for a moment he could not reply ; then he felt himself flushing like a schoolboy . " I am , indeed , " he managed to reply . " I 've known Lex for two years . " There was a dead pause . Into it he injected at random , " I think she is the most beautiful girl I have ever met . " This , at least , he felt would be a suitable and safe admission . Miss Hettie allowed it to sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own pronouncement . " Alexa is a spoiled , turbulent , selfish , willful girl . She 's been indulged since she was born . She goes with a crowd of young people who think of nothing but cocktail parties and night clubs . I am sure you and she could have nothing in common . " THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE 129Hilary felt hot with anger . If it had been a stranger speaking he would have lashed out violently in defense of his beloved . But he restrained himself . There was danger here . Somehow the old lady suspected the truth about him and Lex . " Outward behavior is often misleading , " he said crisply . " You knew Lex was abroad at the present ? " " I did . We have no intercourse with the McCollys , but I usually hear the news of the family from outsiders . I still would like to suggestto you that by the very nature of a clergyman 's office , even his friendships are subject to comment . I 'm sure as time goes on yours will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hilary replied shortly , then very firmly changed the subject , chatted for a few minutes with outward amiability and took his leave . He was deeply disturbed . Miss Hettie 's sharp remarks had been meant as a warning , he felt sure . Why , the insufferable , meddlesome old harpy ! How dared she with no real acquaintance with Lex say what she had said ? He wished now he had stood up to it firmly like a man . He feared he had pussyfooted the whole attack . His instinctivereaction , however , had been the protection of their relationship by his silence . If news of any violent outbreak over her between him and Miss Hettie got around , it might even be the last straw to convince Lex their marriage would be fatal to his career . No , on second thought , he believed he had done wisely , though it had been a hard pill to swallow . He wondered , though , how many other people in the parish suspected his friendship with Lex . Not many , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago to see her , he was in the city for one night only . And because they had so much to say to each other they usually spent the one precious evening in the McCollys ' living room , after dinner here or there . They had never , as he recalled it , run into any St. Matthews people whom he had now come to know . And Lex , he had reason to believe , had not discussed him much with her own friends . " I ca n't kid about you , Hil , " she had said once . " You 've been too serious from the start . " So , if their engagement was ever actually announced , it would come as a complete surprise to most of the parish . He would have to tell the vestry first , of course , out of courtesy . But in a church such as St. Matthews the main requirement in the rector 's wife130 THE BISHOPS MANTLEwould be that she must be socially eligible , and Lex qualified for that . Even old Hettie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family at least , she was of the city 's blood royal . Which thought brought him sharply up against the problem of Samantha Adams . It remained uppermost in his mind all the next morning . Toward three he found himself listening for the arrival of his callers , and suddenly , before they had reached the study , he heard them . At least he heard Samantha . Her strong , positive voice found interveningspace no barrier . " There 's really no reason , Sammy , why we ca n't get a new chancel window for our church ! Let 's just look round while we 're here and get ideas . I 'll start right in when I go back and talk to the Women 's Society about it . We can use the Bazaar money for a starter . " He has n't told her anything yet , Hilary thought with surprise . He 's waiting until I meet her ! The voice continued all the way up the stairs , growing stronger all the time . Then Miss Mowbray opened the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale . Iie looked like a man who had put in a sleepless night . " My wife , Mr. Laurens , " he said . Samantha advanced with smiling confidence . She was short and plump and dumpy . Iler dress was long , her shoes utilitarian . Her face was round under the gray hair , and her bright , dark eyes looked through round shell-riiinncd glasses . She was bounded entirely by curved lines and she was completely and heartily at ease . " Well , Mr. Laurens , I 'm very glad to meet you face to face , for Matt Forrest has certainly talked enough about you . He 's young , is n't he , Sammy , to have a church like this ? You look younger than I 'd pictured you , even . Sam and I here are sort of getting on , but , as I always tell him , you 're just as old as you feel . " " That 's right , " Hilary returned . " How do you like the city , Mrs. Adams ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people stand it to live here . Now I like a little town where you know everybody and where you can have a garden and neighbors running in and all . As I always say , them that like the city can have it , but give me the coun-try ! " THE BISHOPS MANTLE 131 " Mr. Forrest tells me you take quite an active part in your church work there . " " Yes , " Samantha said with a certain complacence , " I 've always tried to hold up my end as well as I could . Keeps me busy , too , with the Altar Guild and the Ladies ' Aid and calls on the shut-ins , and I do all my own work . Sammy , do n't let me forget to send a card to old Mrs. Holmes . I nearly missed her . She 's a Methodist , " she added , turning to Hilary , " but as I always say , we 're all one in Christ . I try to send cards to all the town 's sick when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " Mrs. Adams , " he began , " one thing that weighs heavily on my mind just now is this tenement district just back of the church . I want to do something for those people . You are a woman . What would be your approach to a tired , slatternly young mother with three little children at her heels , and two dirty rooms for a home ? I saw that scene with my own eyes last week . Suppose you called at a place like that , what would you say to such a woman ? In the name of the Lord , I mean , " he added smiling . Samantha Adams ' round face concentrated upon the problem . She pursed her lips . There was written upon her the plain common sense of long generations of small-town women . " Well , " she stated in her unmodulated voice , " I 'd say to her , You get yourself dressed and get out and get some fresh air , and I 'll take care of the children for you . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , and if there was anything in the house to cook I 'd cook up a little supper and have it ready when she 'd come back . As a matter of fact , " she said , adjusting her horn-rimmed glasses , " it might be a good idea to take a soup bone along under your arm . You know , Mr. Laurens , what a lot of people do n't realize is that you can make a very good dinner out of a soup bone . Stew , with dumplings . You would n't believe it . Well , that 's what I 'd do if that woman was in my parish . " Hilary glanced at Adams . His face was not pale now , it was scarlet . He returned to Samantha . " You like people , do n't you ? " The expansive kindliness of her face seemed to fill the room . " Oh , my , yes ! As I always say , the Lord never made a person I could n't take to my heart if I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Mrs. Adams , " he said , " I think your husband has kept something as a surprise for you . I 'm going to tell you now , and I hope very much you may feel as he does about it . I asked him yesterday to come to St. Matthews as assistant rector . " Samantha 's reaction was as startling as Adams ' own had been . She stared disbelievingly up at Hilary , her eyes enormous behind their frames . " No ! " she said . " No , you ca n't mean it ! I 've dreamed it so often , that Sammy would get his big chance . You 've asked him here to St. Matthews ? " " Yes . I want him very much , if you would both be satisfied to come . " " Satisfied ! Oh , Sam , how often have I told you it would come ! I 've never given up praying . All through the years , you know , I have n't . And now it 's happened ! " Suddenly her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hilary read the signs at once and fended off the spoken word . " I 've just remembered something , " he said . " I 've got to go out for a short time . You two stay here as long as you want , and talk things over . Then you can let me know tomorrow . I think we can make the matter of salary satisfactory . " Ile shook hands warmly with them both and left precipitately . I know I 'm taking big chances , he told himself as he walked along the street , but for once I 'm going to play my hunch . Then he glanced toward the tenements and smiled . She 'll be showing every woman there how to make a good dinner out of a soup bone before she 's been here a month , he thought . The next day it was all settled . The salary was named and accepted . Miss Mowbray would do the preliminary apartment hunting in the suburbs for them . They would try to wind up their present work and start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Miss Mowbray in her office , Hilary spoke frankly to Samantha . " You may be lonely here . You wo n't have neighbors of the sort you are used to . Your work will not be with the Woman 's Society or the Altar Guild . There are plenty of women who can do that . I need you and want you to help with the Parish House . I do so hope you 'll be happy doing that . " THE BISHOPS MANTLE 133She looked at him earnestly . " I will be . But that would n't matter . It 's only Sam that counts . He 's never had a church worthy of him , and I 've never understood why . Even years ago , for some reason he never seemed  --  I mean things would start up and just when we 'd think there was going to be a call , it would all fall through . I think it 's because Sam does n't put his best foot forward . He needs someone else to speak up for him , just like Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what this will mean to Sam ! And this I will say for him . Even when he 's had small churches he 's kept up with his books . Such a reader ! He always was a born student . Well , as I 've always said , God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform . ' We 've waited a long time , but you 've given Sam and I our big opportunity at last . " Hilary could feel Adams wincing through the years at Samantha'slapses in English , but her face as she looked up at him now was bathed in a love purely selfless . Hilary 's calendar for the week was moving steadily on toward the vestry dinner meeting on Friday night , but in between were two more engagements to which he did not look forward with joy . Dinner with the J. V. Dunns on Wednesday night turned out , however , to be quite different in atmosphere from that of the Brackenridges . Indeed there was a lushness of warmth in his reception that somewhat startled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he talked and his frost-bitten New England countenance thawed in smiles . His sister , too , was almost embarrassingly cordial in her welcome . The daughter , Maudie , tricked out in a very bright dinnerdress , put in frequent nervous little comments which usually trailed off into nothing before they were finished . As dinner progressedHilary saw that the great light on J. V. 's face came as he looked from Maudie to him and back again to his daughter . Great Jupiter , he thought , there 's something here I 've got to watch out for . J. V. , without apparently having been born to social grace , still did a most masterly job as host . He talked well , not omitting to slip in here and there veiled references to business which might carry their own weight . He made it easy for Hilary to talk . IIe even drew Miss Dunn into the conversation . Only Maudie was allowed to sit quiet except for her little sentences which began and ended nowhere . After leisurely coffee , however , the pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take form . J. V. rose with what was evidently a great attempt at casual apology . " I wonder if you would excuse me if I go up to my study for a few minutes . I 've had a most peculiar headache today . Maybe just a cold coming on  --  so sorry to miss any part of your visit . " Miss Dunn got up at once . " I 'll go with you and get you an aspirin . These spring colds are not to be trifled with . You 'll forgive us , wo n't you , Mr. Laurens ? We 'll be down a little later . " When they were gone , to Hilary 's surprise and alarm he saw Maudie 's pale blue eyes suffuse with tears . He did not pretend to ignore it . " What is the matter , Miss Dunn ? " he asked kindly . She made a little gesture of despair . " I 'm not going to put up any pretense with you . You can see for yourself how it is . This matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession with Father . Ile wants it so desperately . He invites to dinner every eligible young man he comes across . And his standards are high , let me tell you ! No fortune hunters . Then he and Auntie always have to be excused to leave us alone . Oh , I think sometimes I 'd rather die than be so humiliated . " She stopped to mop her eyes but rushed on . Hilary noticed with amazement that her sentences were coming clear-cut and complete , and that the small twitchings of her face had ceased . The girl was n't bad-looking when she was in control of herself , though rather anemic and negative . " I have to make this all plain to you , for I want to go to church and not feel ashamed to look at you . It 's all Father 's doing , whateverhappens , not mine . " Hilary spoke quickly now . " You can feel perfectly free with me , Miss Dunn , for I 'm terribly in love with a girl whom I hope some day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . Maybe sometime I could be of help to you . " " You are already , for I 've never come out with this before to a human soul . It helps just to confess that I 'm desperate . I 'm not attractive . I know it . I 'm not good-looking , and I have n't any poise or self-control . I sort of go to pieces each time I 'm with a man . I get tongue-tied . I twitch . I 'm scared to death , for I know I 'm a failure . But I 'm twenty-seven and Father  --  " The tears came again . " I 'm so sorry for Father . I 've been an awful disappointment , and if I never  --  Do you mind my talking on in this way ? " " Please do , " Hilary said . Somehow he felt deeply moved by the girl 's strange tragedy . With the intuitive sympathy which was a part of him he saw clearly the whole drama . " I wanted to go to college . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of it . I had to go to Miss Hestor 's classes , and then have a big coming-out party . It cost a fortune , but it was ghastly . I think every girl there had a wonderful time but me . Boys scared me stiff even then , before I got into this state I 'm in now . At the dances then the boys were always getting stuck with me . They used money . You remember how that worked ? Well , I was a five-dollar girl . It took that much to buy a cut-in . That 's me . " Maudie leaned her head on her hands . Ililary spoke quickly . " Could n't you try to put this out of your mind  --  marriage awl men ? You know the old saying , Flee love and it will follow you . ' Maybe it would work that way with you . You certainly are n't unattractivewhen you control yourself . You are honest and intelligent and kind . If you could only forget  --  " " But how can I ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring some one else . He 'll never give up . You do n't know Father ! You see it 's not just that he wants to see me married . He wants an heir . " Maudie flushed , but she went on . " There has to be an heir for all the damned money . Excuse me , but that 's the way I feel about it . If we were poor I 'd be a happier person . " " What you need is a job ! " Hilary said emphatically . Maudie 's pale eyes lighted . " Yes , I know . I 'd love it . I even envy the elevator girls in department stores . But Father would n't hear of it . It would mean breaking completely with him . I have n't got the courage and , besides , I 'm sorry for him . Church or charity work is all he 'll let me do . " " We 're going to get the Parish House running again by fall , and I 'll see you get plenty to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can always talk to me . I 'm glad you 've told me what you have to-night . " Before Maudie could reply , they heard the elder Dunns coming down the stairs 136THE BISHOPS MANTLEI THE BISHOP 'S MANTLE 137Maudie spoke very low , her nervousness returning . " Tickets , " she whispered . " Next step . " J. V. was smiling broadly as he returned . " I just remembered , " he said after they had all talked for an hour , " that I 've got tickets for this new show , Farthingale , for two weeks from tonight and I ca n't make it . Got an engagement . I wonder , Mr. Laurens , if you 'd care to take my place ? I know Maudie and her aunt would be very grateful , and so would I. " It sounded like a royal command . Ililary was uncertain what to do . " That 's very kind . May I let you know after I look at my calendar ? And now , I fear I must be going . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farewells as quickly as possible . He had time to note the change in Maudie , however , under her father 's scrutiny . Iler voice broke again into nebulous little phrases ; her lips twitched ; her hands were nervous . Plainly , he thought as he drove back to the rectory , a most interesting ease for a psychiatrist . He would make a note of this and see if he could do something for the girl . The next afternoon at five he found himself being borne upward in the beige and chrome elevator to Diana Downes ' beige and chrome penthouse . She received him in a soft rose silk affair , frothy with lace . Ililay assumed it was meant to be a hostess gown , but he recognized uncomfortably that it missed being a negligee by a very small margin . The tea table was set before the wide window overlooking the city , and he had to admit that she made a striking picture as she faced hint there in the late afternoon light . Her satiny black hair was again brushed smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . lle was struck by the beauty of her small ears , and the general delicacy of her features . She looked like a Rossetti painting . When she leaned over to pour the tea , however , Hilary jerked his eyes away quickly and fixed his gaze across the room . " That 's a fine picture of Capri , " he said in a cool and matter-offactvoice . He fancied a surprised annoyance in her own . " Oh , that ! Just a little thing I picked up once when I was over there . " Hilary decided to take the situation firmly in hand . " I 'm sorry to have to be rather in a rush today . I hope to have my time organized a little better later on . Wo n't you tell me at once about the books I sent you ? Were they of any help ? " Diana set down her cup . Her slim figure seemed to slump . Her large eyes became darkly tragic . " I 've tried so hard , " she said , pitifully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passages you had marked night and morning . I repeated to myself constantly the advice you gave me when you were here last . Then everything seemed futile . I lost my grip again . It 's the feeling of being utterly alone in the world , of having no one close who really cares . That 's what undoes me . Of late I 've felt so desperate at times that I 've almost  --  I mean I 've been afraid ... " She left the sentence ominously in mid-air . Hilary 's natural faith in humankind rose again within him . What a cad he would be to impute motives to this woman which she might never have had ! Perhaps she was actually in danger . He bent himselfearnestly to the task of helping her , pouring out his warm sympathyunstintedly upon her . Slowly , as a wilting flower revives , she drew herself erect . Her dark eyes began to shine . " You seem to give me a reason for living . You give me courage and hope again . I 'll try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . " If only what ? " " If only I may occasionally talk with you as I would to a doctor . I suppose you are indeed a physician of souls , are n't you ? Will you be in the city during the summer ? " " Most of it . I have so much to do . " " I plan to be here a great deal , too . It seems less lonely than the country , though I 'll open the house there for week ends . So if I can report to you from time to time I think it will help me from getting so very low again . Do you know , I do n't like that secretary at the church . " " Miss Mowbray ? Why not ? " " She seems so mechanical . So devoid of sympathy . I 've called up several times and I went over to the study once when I was completely desperate , but she insisted each time you were out ! " " I doubtless was . " " Did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I did n't . " Hilary hated to admit it , for it seemed to incriminateMiss Mowbray . " I knew it ! " Diana was triumphant . " I felt certain you would have gotten in touch with me before this if you had received them . But you can understand now why I disapprove of your secre-tary . " " I 'm sure there was some sort of mistake , " Hilary said carefully , " but I 'll mention it to her . " He took his leave , releasing his hand this time as quickly as possible , and made his way home , still puzzled and uncomfortable . The next morning he spoke to Miss Mowbray . It was a close , muggy day and her white blouse looked as cool as snow . She was the cleanest-looking woman , he decided , that he had ever seen . " Yesterday , " he began , " I received my first criticism of you as a secretary . " Her wide gray eyes looked up , startled , into his . " A certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of times and suspected I never received the messages . I had to admit I had not . What have you to say ? " A faint flush rose in Miss Mowbray 's checks , but her lips parted in a half-smile . " Guilty , " she said . " I think you 'd better tell me all you know , had n't you ? " She hesitated . " The trouble is , my reasons would never stand in court . I do n't honestly know anything about Mrs. Downes . But I 've heard a few rumors and I used my own intuition . My guess is that she might be a somewhat unscrupulous woman . Each time she called you really were out . But 1 ' 11 not take things into my own hands again , I promise . " Iler face looked earnest and troubled . " It 's just that now when you are new and feeling your way I wanted to spare you any unnecessary complications . " Hilary grinned . " You felt I would be inadequate to cope with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty , " she said . And suddenly they laughed together . But Hilary took careful note of the incident . On the evening of the specially called meeting of the vestry , Hilary felt nervous . Eight men out of the ten had accepted for dinner . Morris was in his element , the big library and dining room were both graciously correct and welcoming , but still Hilary wishedTHE BISHOPS MANTLE 139as he dressed that he had held the meeting in the study . If there should be tension it might be less embarrassing to have it there . When the guests arrived , Hilary was struck first of all by the general urbanity of the group . They were all highly successful business and professional men , conventional in their attitudes and behavior . He had a wild wish for one blunt Alex McColly amongst them who would state his opinions with forthright and even profane conviction . These men were not so . They would be reserved , unfailinglycourteous even in disapproval and strong with the power drawn from position and experience . He welcomed them now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close already ; Avison and Thornton , who were also definitely his friends ; Henry Alvord , who would unquestionably oppose everything he was planning to say tonight ; old Judge Ball , whom he knew slightly as yet but greatly admired ; and three others who from the first had seemed to him rather negligible  --  Hartley , Powers , and Weston . To his surprise the talk at dinner turned upon the same fears Alex McColly had voiced . The word " war " was tossed back and forth around the table . Would it come ? Had Chamberlain failed ? Would England call Hitler 's bluff ? Should she , or should she let Europe fight it out herself ? What the United States had to do this time , however , was to keep well out of it , that was certain . Judge Ball raised his heavy voice . " That sort of talk seems to me foolish . Whether we like it or not , we stand or fall with England . We may love her or hate her or be indifferent to her but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " A storm of argument was at once under way . Hilary listened , amazed and alarmed . So deeply engrossed had he been with the affairs of the church that he had given scant attention to the seething problems beyond the sea . Now , suddenly , he felt as though all his own plans , looming so large in his mind , had become dwarfed before the death throes of nations . He talked little , drawing out his guests . The food was excellent , and Morris ' service beyond all comparison . He could see the men relaxing and mellowing as the meal progressed . Back in the library with the tobacco smoke making a genial haze , Hilary took his stand before the fireplace , one elbow leaning on the mantel.
