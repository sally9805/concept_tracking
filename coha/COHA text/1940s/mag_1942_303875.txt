A sensational advance in industrial technique was revealed last week and immediately opened the way for major advances in the aviation industry . The new technique : arc-welding of magnesium . Result : the further development of the so-called flying wing-a weird , batlike plane with no tail , no fuselage and an extraordinary efficiency ( TIME , Oct. 27 ) . Some other results : <P> &gt; Magnesium-one-third lighter than aluminum-can now become a primary aeronautical material , rivaling aluminum and competing with stainless steel ( TIME , June 22 ) , instead of remaining a secondary metal used only in engine parts , wheels , accessories . <P> &gt; Construction of planes , especially their wings , can be much simplified and cheapened . <P> &gt; Magnesium arc-welding-and perhaps the flying wing-will remain monopolies of the U.S. and its allies . Reason : arc-welding magnesium requires helium , which is found in useful quantities only in the U.S. <P> Until last week , arc-welding magnesium was almost as impossible as welding paper , and for the same reason : this most inflammable metal* would ignite from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does in magnesium incendiary bombs . But after two years of research , engineers of Northrop Aircraft Inc. discovered that magnesium can safely be arc-welded if the hot metal is blanketed with helium to exclude atmospheric oxygen . The helium also cools the molten metal , acts as a metal-cleaning flux . <P> The advantage of welded magnesium on the wing surfaces of planes is that it can be used in thicker sheets than steel and aluminum . This increased thickness has two effects : 1 ) it lessens surface vibrations which in time will weaken the wing ; 2 ) it simplifies the maze of ribs and spars now built into wings to stiffen them . <P> Doing away with much of this clutter of ribs and spars is a major step in development of the flying wing , for this bodiless plane must have clear wing interiors to make room for passengers , cargo , bombs , Northrop Aircraft built a two-engined flying wing with a 38-ft. span , flew it so successfully last fall that the U.S. Army popped the queer plane out of sight for further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lacking a tail , has 40% less head resistance than a conventional plane , and every square inch of its body contributes to lift . Hence designers believe the flying wing can either <P> 1 ) get the same speed with perhaps half the horsepower of a normal plane or <P> 2 ) get 25-30% more speed with the same horsepower . <P> *Exposed magnesium parts of planes are coated with a secret , fire-resistant paint .
