Andrew Wyeth , 31 , is one of the narrowest of young U.S. artists-and one of the most widely respected . He is a portraitist who paints only his friends , and a landscapist who portrays only two localities . His new pictures , on exhibition in a Manhattan gallery last week , owed nothing to the prevailing distortions of Paris : they were in the straightforward , realistic U.S. tradition of Thomas Eakins , Winslow Homer and Edward Hopper . Bleak as a December dawn , they seemed a startling contrast to the cheerful , crop-headed young man who had painted them . <P> Up in the Attic . One , entitled Christina 's World had cost Wyeth 3 months of steady work . " I 'd go up to Christina 's attic every morning at 8:30 , " he recalled , " and not come down until supper time . Christina 's a close friend of mine and crippled . Every other day she drags herself across the field from her house to visit the graves of her family . People might call that a gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way . " <P> A Wyeth portrait of Christina took second prize at last month 's Carnegie Exhibition ( TIME , Oct. 25 ) . " It looks sort of photographic , " Wyeth admits . " I guess they all do , but the fact is I never paint from nature . I make careful sketches and then change everything around . For instance the field in Christina 's World is not really that large , but I felt it that way . Ever since I was a small kid I felt it was big . For a month and a half I built the ground up , to make it come toward you , that surge of earth . " <P> Every blade of grass in the picture is separately painted . " Just because something is tightly done does n't mean anything , " Wyeth says , " but I feel that the more you get into the textures of things , the less you have to clutter up the composition with a lot of props . When you lose simplicity you lose drama , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an illustrator at heart . " <P> Down in Maine . Sickly as a boy , Wyeth kept close to the studio of his father , famed Illustrator N. C. Wyeth . ( " Ever since I was twelve , nothing has meant anything to me except painting . " ) But while his father brought knights , pirates and Scottish chiefs to life , illustrating books like Treasure Island and the Boys ' King Arthur , young Andrew became more &; more fascinated with illustrating the little universe around him-at Chadds Ford , Pa. , where he was born , and down east in Maine , where the family spent its summers . He lives now with his wife and two sons within a mile of his Pennsylvania birthplace . <P> " I tramp around there day after day , " he says , " looking for something to paint . Mood is what I 'm after . I go through hell to get a good subject , but once I do I 'm happy because it 's always something I feel close to . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
