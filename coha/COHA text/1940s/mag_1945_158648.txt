PREKASKA 'S WIFE-Helen Wheaton-Dodd , Mead ( $3 ) . <P> " You sure do n't be de dype to seddle down in a hole like dis , " said the Norwegian skipper gloomily as he watched pert , young Santa Fe Schoolteacher Helen Wheaton get ready to clamber over the side of his dinky schooner in Atka Harbor . As she said goodbye to the skipper and boarded the bobbing dory in which her bridegroom waited with open arms , Helen was thinking much the same thing . <P> " Nothing I write , " says Author Wheaton in this light , gay record of her year-long ( 1935 ) honeymoon in the bleak Aleutians , " can possibly . . . show me to be a woman of strength and initiative . " As wife of the local prekaska ( storekeeper ) , and the only white woman on Atka , Helen regarded her Aleut neighbors with amazement streaked with alarm . The black haired , giggling , almond-eyed Aleuts , smelling strongly and permanently of fish , regarded Helen in turn with open admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks was to hang out an accumulation of family wash . As the intimate objects sailed out one by one along the pulley line stretching from her kitchen window , Helen heard a spirited commentary from dozens of Aleut women , who had assembled on the square below . " Is funny pants , " shouted one when Husband Thornie 's pajamas appeared . " What is ? " When Helen 's blue net dressing gown sailed out , it drew a tremendous round of applause . " Is pretty ! " shouted the gallery . " To dance or bed in ? " <P> Discouraged with laundry , Helen advertised for help . Three women promptly appeared . After a long day , Helen asked what she owed . " No moneys at all , " they answered happily . " Is much fun come wash in house of Prekaska 's wife . . . . We like tell other Aleut womens about your house . " <P> Aleut males shared their wives and money with equal unconcern .

Chief Dirks , who invariably retreated to his bed when any trouble loomed , explained the system : " Mike Creveden very lazy , no catch foxes , only two or three . We say should n't do that but he say he lazy and ca n't help it . " <P> Snigeroff 's Nose . Drunkenness was regarded as an affliction rather than a misdemeanor . Nobody except Helen minded the endless consumption of a beverage brewed by " tossing sugar , flour and yeast-and sometimes a handful of rice or half-rotten fruit-into a dirty butter barrel " filled with water and allowing the mess to " make " for four days . " Do n't be silly , " said Thornie , dismissing Helen 's alarm at the battle royal which invariably accompanied this wassail . " The boys are just having a good time . Just like kids . . . They really enjoy it . " <P> Bitterly Helen asked him who had enjoyed it when Nick Houdikoff bit off a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , " answered Thornie triumphantly . " She put that piece of nose in a bottle of water , then showed it around to prove what a good fighter her husband was . "
