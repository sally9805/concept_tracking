" Old Blood and Guts , " also known as " Buck Rogers , " proved his right to both titles at Casablanca . I ' LL never forget hearing Maj. Gen. George S. Patton , Jr. , talk about the realities of leader  --  ship . It was at lunch and he was describing his ideas with something dangling from a fork .

I can not move that piece of spaghetti forward by pushing on the tail end . It will only buckle up in the middle . So will the unit of an officer who tries to command from the rear .

And when he stormed ashore in a tank , that is precisely what he did on the historic Sunday of November eighth . Tall , tough , and agile as a snake , Major General Patton is a living advertisement for a life well spent out of doors . His shrimp-pink complexion , steel By TED SHANE blue eyes and sandy hair are the perfect physical complement for the astonishing initiative and in  --  credible courage that have given him his honorary Army title , Old Blood and Guts . His sense of the dramatic and his flair for designing extraordinary battle costumes also have led his men to call him " The Green Hornet , " " The Man From Mars , " and " Buck Rogers . " These labels are pasted on him with affection , although not within his hearing . The general is photogenic and he is quite an actor . He enjoys these distinctions to the fullest , but he is not the kind of general whose subordinates could find enjoyment in reminding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bourbon aristocracy of Virginia . He was born to a lot of money in San Gabriel , California , on November 11 , 1885 . At the age of eleven he was an accomplished polo player , polishing his game to perfection later at Virginia Military Institute . Because of his inability to spell and an imagination which expressed itself in new costumes for old forms of practical jokes , he did not exactly set V.M.I. intellectual standards . He majored in polo , football and horsemanship . Later , at West Point , he continued to specialize in football and horsemanship , dismounting long enough to set an intercollegiate 220-yard-dash record . " End , " he says , when asked for a r  --  sum ? of his football career . The Navy was beating the Army PORTRAIT BY GEORGE HUGHES regularly in those years , and Patton can not abide the thought of losing . At the Point he also began to exercise a plentiful supply of brains . Although his spelling was held to be worse than George Washing  --  ton 's , and he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an excellent student and a voracious reader of military lore . He could dash off jingles with the facility of a Kipling , his favorite poet after Bobbie Burns and Robert Service . He grabbed off the second most coveted honor at West Point  --  that of upper-class adjutant . In 1912 he went to Stockholm as a one-man mod  --  ern pentathlon team , coming in fourth because they could not find his tenth bullet on a target . Obviously it had passed through one of the nine other holes in the bull's-eye , but the judges would not allow it . Like all true Virginians , Patton hated to walk anywhere as long as there was horseflesh in the barn . So he went into the cavalry . Believing in the principle that a cavalry officer should be an eter  --  nally fit athlete , an expert swordsman  --  he can cut an apple on your head , blindfolded , charging from ten paces  --  and a crack pistol and rifle shot , Patton perfected himself at all these somewhat dated military arts .

We come to Iceland , where there 's not enough ice for ten days of ice skating a year , where there 's never been an Eskimo and where they laugh at a sheepskin coat . We get plenty of extra dough and ca n't find anything to blow it on . We get all set to protect the Icelanders and they ignore us .

That was Amer  --  ica 's No. 1 danger spot then and they figured on the first crack at the Germans . But the majority of them did n't even see a German plane during their first year up there . I have just come from a year in Iceland , covering the activities of the United States ' sub-Arctic contin  --  gent for the United Press . I 've had a good chance to get acquainted with Pete and thousands like him and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of settling down in a strange land under Maj. Gen. Charles H. Bonesteel . They are as comfortable as could be hoped in such an uninviting place . They know that guarding the dreary lava fields of Iceland is a very important job in Uncle Sam 's war effort , protecting the vital base athwart the allied sea lanes to Britain and Russia . They know that if they left , the Germans would come , base their U-boats in the fiords and quickly bring the Battle of the North Atlantic to a fatal end . Gen.

Ex  --  citing things rarely happen , yet the garrison must await on the alert every minute against what he termed that fatal five minutes " if the Germans should attack .

And there 's never been a railroad in " Why , there ai n't an Eskimo or polar bear on the place . " When the Americans landed at Reykjavik , they discovered themselves in a city of 40,000 that does its best to pass as a European city . On the surface it succeeds pretty well . Downtown streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six stories high , and shopwindows look much like those in small Midwestern cities . Plenty of electric lights , dial telephones , newsboys on the corners and uniformed policemen untangling traffic of American and European automobiles . There are dressy streets with stucco houses set in spacious lawns filled with shrubs and flowers . But behind them are cramped parts of the old town , 1 where the streets are lava dirt and the houses corrugated-iron shacks . That 's a hang-over from the days when Reykjavik was an isolated Arctic town clinging to the Atlantic shore . The soldiers were quick to discover that the Ice  --  landers are all wrapped up in their own history and are acutely disturbed by a slighting remark about their country . They think Iceland is the finest coun  --  try in the world . American troops are scattered in camps far and wide over Iceland 's 40,000 square miles of moun  --  tains , deserts and fiords . Lots of men have n't seen Reykjavik since they landed . They have forgotten what a city looks like , have n't even seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from home in six weeks . They consider themselves leading contenders for the title , " America 's most isolated doughboys . " I visited a typical outlying camp in a tiny coastal village many hours ' drive over rutted mud roads from Reykjavik . It was a cluster of Nissen huts on the shore , centered around a drill ground . The camp 's duty was to guard the shore and adjacent inland regions . The Nissen but was a wonderful invention . It looks like a rain trough placed on the ground , bottom side up , painted dark red and plugged at the ends with concrete blocks or wood . Sod banks packed around its base hold it in place against the high winds whirling over its curved surfaces . Inside the hut , under the glare of electric-light bulbs dropped from the curved roof , eight boys have lined up their cots , four on each side on the planked floor . In the center is a pot-bellied coal stove . Atop it is a constant hot-water supply in an old five-gallon gasoline tin . Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands have fashioned shelves and cupboards from packing boxes . Foot lockers beneath the beds contain extra clothes . Near the beds stand rifles and other light weapons . The boys are ready for quick action . Supplies must be brought to this camp by sea or by truck over the " Burma road , " which is n't pass  --  able in winter except by pony . The soldiers had just received a sixteen-mm. movie projector when I visited them and were excited about prospects of an occasional American movie . During the summer they had a baseball team , but no competitors . In spare time they climb mountains and fish in the bay . Their chief means of transport to other camps is some jeeps , which can bounce along the mountain roads with less difficulty than other military ve  --  hicles . Some jeeps have been winterized by building wallboard tops on them to break the wind . In the officers ' mess a coal fire blazed in a fire  --  place of native rock . On the table tin plates were heaped with roast pork , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie topped off the din  --  ner . Over in the enlisted men 's mess the soldiers were eating the same food from their mess kits . Every mouthful had been shipped 3000 miles acrossuniform and sent off to a dull job thousands of miles from home . They fear the Army as a disrupting in  --  fluence , and they wish everybody would go back home . You must remember that this country has lived an isolated life , practically cut off from the rest of the world for a thousand years . " The Icelander 's coldness is n't pro-Nazi , just pro-Icelandic . The people go out of their way to pro  --  claim their neutrality . There 's the case of an Army veterinarian who established a laboratory in the Reykjavik University to study Icelandic livestock diseases . He had lent several hits of equipment tobest collegiate manner . So were a lot of her girl friends . But behind many a comely " stulka " ? Icelandic for " girl " ? stands a stern father who frowns on her friendship with soldiers . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attended the Uni  --  versity of Minnesota was forbidden by her father to attend dinner parties at American officers ' messes or go out anywhere with men in uniform . Yet she has gone out with an American living in Reykjavik who dresses in civilian clothes . Going with soldiers is known as being in the austand . Many officers who the submarine-infested Atlantic from the United States . The twenty-four-year-old lieutenant commanding the camp , called the " old man " by his younger assistants , said the boys liked being off by them  --  selves and acting as their own masters . " Memoranda from base headquarters some  --  times take days to reach us , " he said . " We just go ahead and use our judgment . There is n't much way to amuse ourselves , but we all work so hard that we are ready to turn in at . night . " Chief complaints were lack of news from the out  --  side world and slowness of mail . A small mimeo  --  graphed news sheet with scanty headline news reached camp about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful radio that could pick up American stations . Like boys in other camps all over Iceland , they had Ettle to do with the Icelanders in the adjoining fishing village . They flirted and whistled at the girls , and the officers had a few business contacts with village officials , but otherwise the camp and village might as well have been miles apart . There is no use pretending that the Icelanders like the American soldiers . They never could like soldiers from any country . They 've never had a soldier of their own and they do n't understand soldiers . Actually , there has been only a minimum of incidents between the Icelanders and the soldiers . The Icelanders simply ignore the troops as much as possible . As a sergeant in Pete 's outfit put it , " They just give us a fishy eye and a cold shoulder . Some of the boys would like to get acquainted and visit their homes . But they never give us a tumble . A lot of the fellows do n't really know what the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chance to find out . " SIP An Icelander who has lived several years in Canada gave me this explanation of his people 's attitude : " Most Icelanders do n't see the Army as a throng of boys taken from civilian life , put into a research man in the same building . One day the veterinarian needed a small electric bulb , so he asked his neighbor to lend him one . The Icelander agreed . " But remember , " he said , " I 'm doing this as a personal favor . I do n't want to help the Army , be  --  cause I 'm strictly neutral . " Pete and his buddies have found one group whole  --  heartedly in favor of the occupation  --  the girls . They have fallen for the Americans and are having the time of their lives . " I sure was surprised how good looking the girls are , " Pete said . " Never seen so many blondes in my life . I thought maybe they would be wearing sealskins or something , but here I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so fancy as in Louisville or Cincinnati . Put some of these dolls in Fifth Avenue clothes and they would be knockouts . " Big trouble with the girls , the boys said , is that there are n't enough to go around . It 's a lucky doughboy who gets a girl friend away from a half dozen competitors . The girls like the American uni  --  forms , the slangy " lines " and ready pocket money . Many of them would he willing to marry Americans and go to the United States , but the Army and Ice  --  landic government are saying " no " in chorus . One night I went to a dance Pete 's outfit gave in -a big Nissen but in Reykjavik . The band was a gang assembled from a regiment and was full of hot licks . Hepcat soldiers were teaching the girls to jitterbug , and the girls were eating it up . I remember one sleek corporal from the Bronx cutting a rug with a red-frocked blonde . She was willing and determined but slightly bewildered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging out in the date Icelandic girls must meet them at the Hotel Borg or other downtown spots , because they are n't permitted in the homes . Among the biggest headaches for the troops is the weather  --  and I do n't mean the cold , because it does n't really get cold . Winter temperatures in Reykjavik hang around freezing , thanks to the Gulf Stream . But oh , that rain Continued on Page 63 ) // to keep their horses ? " The com  --  mandant allowed as how he could give the young lieutenant 's horse stable room . Imagine his horror when he learned that Patton had brought not one horse but twenty-six . Polo was the answer . At fifty-seven , his game is still very much on the " for-keeps " side . " Boy , he rides you down , " a young officer told me . " And he hits hard  --  often on the head . You ca n't ride him down . " Three officers in Patton 's old cavalry outfit have one eye . " Lost them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the genuine Patton legend be  --  gins in 1916 , with Villa 's raid on Co  --  lumbus , New Mexico . Pershing Was in command . A Villa bandit called Can  --  delario Cervantes had killed some American boys . Patton chafed in his tent , anxious for a crack at Candelario . " I will snuff out that Candelario like this , " he said , taking shots at the light in the tent . To this day he occasionally potshots cans and light bulbs to keep his hand in " In time , in time , " Pershing soothed his young officer . Patton thereupon sat on Pershing 's doorstep until he was given permission to hunt the Mexican . He filled a car full of his chosen men  --  he 's a great guy to pick his team ? and entered Mexico in a cloud of dust . They trailed Candelario to a small Mexican town . Within a big cuartel of ' dobe walls , the bandit entrenched himself . Patton and his men surrounded-the place and I loosed a hot fire . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can  --  delario still withstood the siege and seemed to have plenty of ammunition . " I 'm going in , " Patton announced . Patton is not a restrainable man . So in he went . There was a sound of firing . Yells and moans . Then silence . Cov  --  ered with grime and sweat , out came Patton , carrying Sefior Cervantes like a deer over his shoulder , very much dead . " He tried to get me when I was reloading , " said Patton . " He shot fast , but not too well . " He carried the body to the car , tossed it over the fender , climbed in and headed for home , Iron Steed Now , as everybody knows , the last war was peculiarly safe for the cavalry . In fact , the cavalry , through no fault of its own , got an undeserved going-over in the press for absenteeism from action . But there were no trenches for horses . No six-footer with a body like a ram  --  rod and the fighting heart of Tecumseh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's fighting on tap . With an instinct for the future which always has marked him , Patton took a look at the new iron cavalry ? those strange , snorting , hard-riding mounts called tanks . What he saw was good . Like cavalrymen , tanks could scout , feel out the soft spots , then cut through like a spear , fan out behind the lines , and raise hell in the back country with communications , supply dumps and generals . Patton fitted into his new armor more snugly than you do into your wartime woollies . Another chapter was added to the Patton legend . Going into combat a captain , he soon became known for his rash daring and finishing punch . of 1918 . Moving swiftly with his bri  --  gade into the Meuse-Argonne sector , he gut his on September twenty-sixth , the first day of the offensive there . Be -- cause Patton himself wo n't talk , there are a lot of conflicting stories as to where he got it , anatomically speaking . Some say he was wounded in the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't true . " His head is too sound , " a fellow general told me , laughing . Others say his legs were riddled - an odd spot for a tanker to be hit . The best guess seems to be that he collected a sizable collection of slugs somewhere around the midriff . There is no doubt about how he got his . Young Captain Patton broke through the German front lines with his tanks . He and his tank crews found themselves alone , without sup  --  port . Patton himself went back to find the infantry and do some eloquent lobbying for support . While on that one-man mission he ran smack into a pillbox well populated with Fritzie boys and their guns . He dealt with that problem in characteristic fashion , making a frontal charge while pitching high hard ones and a few curves with hand grenades . One of the grenades got the pillbox , but the pillbox also got Patton through the middle . It was Col. George S. Patton , Jr. , after the Armistice . The colonel not only skipped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but came out of World War I with the Distinguished Service Cross , the Silver Star and the Purple Heart . The ways of peace go hard with the Pattons of this world . He married Bea  --  trice Ayer , of Boston and the American Woolen Mills family . He rode , He played polo and he showed his fine horses . He learned to fly . He raised a happy family and he enjoyed making editorial criticism of the good adven  --  ture books his wife wrote . He and Mrs. Patton were the happiest of comrades , and their especial joy was to sail the seas together in their seagoing boat . They once made a 9000-mile cruise with their eight-year-old son in a secondhand forty-footer , finishing in Hawaii . Seagoing generals are rare in any man 's army ! The Claws of the Army But all this was not enough . Patton held the deep and flaming conviction that those were not years of peace , but the nervous and irksome quarter cen  --  tury of an armistice . He continued to lead the Spartan life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the one hun  --  dred faster than the average West Point graduate . ) He devoured military his  --  tory and news to keep himself ever ready for the resumption of world war . He wrote textbooks , and concentrated especially on tank maneuvers , invent  --  ing some new ones . He preached the necessity of more and better tanks to all who would listen during those years when our military was considered sort of out of season . " An Army without tanks is like a lobster without claws , " he said . " Tanks are the claws that penetrate and envelop and pinch . " So it was in the military cards that when our country began to go on a war basis Old Blood and Guts was swiftly promoted to major general and given command of the 2nd Armored Division , then of an Armored Corps . Patton was willing and ready . The way he trained his corps for the current offensive in North Africa gives you an idea of just how ready for realities George Patton was . Training for desert war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March of 1912 , where Patton con  --  ferred with Generals Lesley J. McNair and Mark W. Clark , a Southwestern area lying directly west of the Colorado River was selected . Patton had made reconnoitering expeditions over the terrain , which permitted troop move  --  ments over an expanse 180 miles long and ninety miles wide . Mountainous contours made it possible for opposing troops on maneuvers to make marches up to 400 miles without catching sight of each other . The desert training site  --  such as no country in Europe could offer troops  --  was bordered on the east by the Colorado River ; on the south by a line extending from Desert Cen  --  ter , California , to Yuma , Arizona ; on the north by a line extending from Desert Center to Searchlight , Nevada . Within the triangle a base camp for a training center was established twenty miles east of Indio , California . Divi  --  sional camps were set up at Desert Center , Iron Mountain and Needles . The region is so sparsely populated that once during a reconnoitering trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Patton fought for equipment and he fought for the men he wanted as sub  --  ordinate officers . Then he told them what he wanted from them in the way of leadership . " Dugout-telephone days are over , gentlemen , " he said . " You ca n't run a war from a desk . You can now run it from a tank or a motorcycle . Never ask a man to do anything that you would n't do yourself . " Patton 's hand-picked subordinates were selected for physique , first ; in  --  telligence , second ; and an ability to absorb profanity without curling up , third . " You can not run an Army with  --  out it , " their general has remarked . Riding the tanks is not easy ; it is a little like riding in a spike-lined upper berth on a tropical single-track railway built over a volcano . All Patton 's officers are athletes who have lots of nerve and whee . Their training was exactly like that of the average tanker . They had to go into the bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to change a bogie wheel in a mud bed or the scorching heat of the desert , sleep on the ground as every tanker does , get bumped out of jeeps and right them in mid-air  --  and even ride the suicidal motorcycles , the mo  --  torized jerks of the Armored Force . If they madh it , they were admitted to the Battalion of Death . If they failed , back to the infantry they went . Few failed . Patton has a way with men . Speaking of men , he likes all kinds . Though it costs , paradoxically enough , a little more to make a tanker out of a Minnesota tractor driver than it does out of a Georgia cracker  --  crackers be  --  ing more warlike  --  Patton managed to get a pretty hardy crew together . " An ideal tanker , " he told me , " is a fellow who can drive three hundred miles all day , then stay awake seventy-two hours after that . " On maneuvers his troops got in the habit of going without sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on the ground next to their tank , like their general . Patton rode the tanks  --  small , me  --  dium and jumbo  --  rode the motor  --  cycles , jeeps and anything else on four wheels . His own tank , spinning along with a tin flag with two red stars gleam  --  ing in the sun , Patton glaring out of it , mouth drawn , eyes peering , his head encased in a giant gold crash helmet , yelling encouragement , advice , criti  --  cism  --  that was a sight to see on maneuvers . Because the tank has a way of com  --  ing up and socking the rider inside of it an iron punch in the most unexpected places , Patton designed a giant crash helmet , guaranteed to keep your brains inside your skull and equipped with two leather gadgets to hold the ear  --  phones in place . His coverall has a snap-on place for the divisional insigne . A Bow to Buck Rogers For himself , the general invented a forest-green Buck Rogers uniform with diagonal brass buttons . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry . Patton also made a special holster in his bosom in which to carry his inevitable pearl-handled pistols , for the close work . No one has ever been able to puzzle out the uses of all the gadgets on the uni  --  form 's many hooks . " What are those two buttons ? " a fresh reporter once asked the general . " To keep my pants up , " he replied blandly . Patton adopted the football coach 's skull practice for training purposes , and added fireside chats after the maneuvers had been carried out . For skull practice he uses a sand-table model of a battlefield for demonstra  --  tion purposes , and profanity for em  --  phasis . Patton 's picturesque language is much more effective than if the lec  --  ture were delivered in good dull Army-manual terminology . Most typical is his classically simple description of tank fighting : " The idea is to hold the enemy by the nose and kick him in the rumble seat . " His Signal Corps photographers have illustrated this most graphically , using live models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a maneuver . When it was over , he made a little speech into a field microphone . " Gentlemen , " he said in a squeaky but sharp voice , " I congratulate ev  --  eryone on this performance . It was clear and excellent . Gentlemen " ? he changed mood ? " let me warn you that this may be the last time you will use blank ammunition . I therefore remind you that you are in a killing business . Kill the other before he kills you . The quicker you kill him and the farther forward you go , the longer you will live . " The effect of the speech was chilling , yet more inspiring than a long oration . You could feel the thrill go through the loose ranks of officers . He changed mood again . Now his eyes twinkled . " I 'm sorry , gentlemen , I could n't say what I really wanted to . I have a slight cold . " The ensuing laugh was warming , that bleak Georgia morning . More recently , just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire division about battle . " Do n't be afraid of how you will act in battle , " he said . " You will act with courage . You will do your duty . Being under fire will scare you , but it is n't as terrible as you think it is . " He wound up his talk with a poem on battle which I did not take down in my notes . It was a stirring poem , though , I remember well , and there was no guff about it . He felt so very deeply about his subject and about the destinies of his men that , for the first time in the knowledge of any officers I talked to subsequently , he choked up . He is a man with a tough , rigid discipline of mind and emotion . There was a tightening of the muscles in his throat , a rigidity in his jaw , and then he went on as before . " Thanks to you men and to General Devers , we are ready . I shall be de  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a dozen thousand and more of his men jumped to their feet to give him a burst of spontaneous applause . Later , sitting in his simple barracks office , the general was another man . In his khaki shirt , he looked sandy and pink and gentle , his eyes twinkling constantly . We were surrounded by staff officers who bent to catch every word that fell from his lips . We spoke of dogs , and he felt re  --  gretful at having to leave his own he loved bird dogs behind . But , he told me , you can always pick up a dog in a foreign country . He was reminded of a British officer who got the Victoria Cross for saving the regimental goat , which had wan  --  dered out into no man 's land in the last war , gilt horns and all , " Posthumously , " he pointed out . " That 's the only way you can get that damned medal ! " We spoke of Man Mountain Dean , the 300-pound wrestler who fought with Patton in the tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as a sort of sentimental mascot . Dean was doing clerical work , being near  --  sighted , and was occasionally called out to lift a tank out of a ditch or mudhole . Man Mountain Dean was left behind when the boys were taken overseas . That morning Patton told me he had Stopped a soldier in his outfit and asked him his age . " Bless my soul , sir , if I see thirty again . " After a gruff , good-natured shaking , the boy admitted that he was just fifteen . " Why did you join the Army ? " " ' Cause the food was better than at home , sir . " Surprisingly , Old Blood and Guts likes the orientation courses in which our soldiers are being taught what it 's all about . " They 'll not be political morons , as in the last war , " the general said succinctly . General Patton fought fiercely against my " writing him up . " He made me promise that I would n't print anything about him until he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a gen  --  eral I am , " he explained . " Of course , if I do n't live up to the article , it wo n't matter . Because if I do n't make good , I 'll never come back alive . " The Will to Win Well , after Casablanca , it looks to me as though it 's okay to print the article . As a footnote , I 'd like to say some  --  thing about the boys who are with Old Blood and Guts , the boys with whom I rode tanks when they were training in this country . They were all champions , and they were all convinced that Pat  --  ton had accomplished that . There was Lt. Lou Winterberger , who gave me my tanking baptism as he knocked down tall pine trees with an accuracy and tenacity the Germans are learning about even now . And Lieutenant Jones , graduate of Drexel Institute and Gen  --  eral Electric , who cared for his men and their equipment with the same tenderness he showed toward his one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil Mc4 Clean , who sat with me in a twenty  --  seven-ton tank for a solid hour and pointed out its beauties with the en  --  thusiasm and diffidence of a lovesick swain trying to tell a pal about the vir  --  tues of his girl . A clean-living youngster from the South , McClean treated the idea of death with contempt . " Hell , " he said , " sure I may get my head sheared off by a hunk of some  --  thing , and maybe then I will die like a rat in a cage . But I do n't figure to do that and , if I do , anyway know what it 's like . " They were former New York taxi drivers , farm hands with calluses from the tractors still coating their palms , ranchers who figured tanks were n't as temperamental as windmills , college athletes and just plain run-of-the-mill young men . Some of the latter were I among the ablest .

The will to win and the ability to carry out the dictates of that will had been poured and sweated into them relentlessly by their general . I wish them Godspeed and all luck .
