Sir Ofori Atta was a stout , pious , blue-black man who ruled over Akim Abuakwa on Africa 's Gold Coast . London knew him . Once he visited King George V to be knighted for his services to the Crown ( supplying soldiers and bearers ) in World War I. Again he went to London on business , as a director of Akim , Ltd. , a diamond mining company . He wore a heavy golden crown , a purple and gold toga . Wherever he went , a small black boy in silk knee breeches walked before him . The boy was the repository of Sir Ofori 's soul . He also carried Sir Ofori 's heavy ceremonial sword . A year ago Death , as it must to all men , came to Sir Ofori Atta in his ahinfie ( palace ) . <P> Sir Ofori had not long been dead when his good friend Akyea Mensah , the Odikro of Apedwa , subchief of Akim Abuakwa. disappeared . The Odikro 's servant and two pygmy followers also vanished . For nine months Gold Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged them with murdering the Odikro . In time the eight stood in the prisoner 's dock in Accra 's white , sweltering courthouse . They rolled their eyes , cast covertly accusing glances at each other , sweated while witnesses testified . <P> One witness said he had seen the Odikro entering the late Sir Ofori 's ahinfie . Another claimed that he had seen him offered a drink , then bludgeoned on the head from behind . A third had seen the Odikro , unconscious , tied in a chair with a long knife thrust between his jaws . The Odikro 's blood trickled down the knife , dripped into a wooden bowl . A fourth said he had been handed the bowl of blood , ordered to paint Sir Ofori 's stool with it . As the jurors could see , the stool had been painted . Fitted together , these bits of testimony spelled out the ritual of an ancient , sacrificial funeral rite . <P> The trial lasted 23 days . All of the defendants offered alibis . Two , in addition , claimed as proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circumcised persons are forbidden to join in the ritual of painting stools with human blood . The seven jurors ( six natives , one European ) retired , scanned the exhibits , deliberated three hours . The verdict : all defendants guilty . <P> Last week , in Accra , eight zealous followers of Sir Ofori were sentenced to be hanged for seeing to it that he was buried with all the honors they deemed due to a man of his position .
