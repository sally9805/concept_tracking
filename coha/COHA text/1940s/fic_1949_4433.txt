The SUN KING By GASTON DERREAUX The people of Par'si'ya forgot their God , and worshipped only murder , and sin . But then the virgin Too-che gave birth to a male child .... Before the flood , even before Egypt 's greatness , the world was divided into three main countries , named Jaffeth , Shem and Arabin'ya . There were other less populated lands and places ; Uropa in the west , Heleste in the north , and the two great lands of the far west , called North and South Guatama . Now , at the juncture of the borders of the three greatest countries , lay a mighty city , named Oas . It was the capital city of the Arabin'yan nation called Par'si'ya . Its Temple of Skulls was the greatest known to any traveler , but the temples built to the god , Mazda , and his son , Ihua'Mazda , were empty and unadorned  --  the people had forgotten God . So-qi , King of Oas , sent out his armies throughout Jaffeth ( China ) , conquering and slaying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more gold and more slaves for the enriching of King So-qi . His harem was the greatest of buildings of the mighty city , and his wives beyond man 's ability to count . * * * * * Too-che was one of the finest ornaments of the city of Oas . Too-che was slim , her breasts were two mounds of magic , her eyes were pools of mystic green depths , her legs were subtle , sinuous beauty . But Too-che was a virgin , and in all that city of a million sinful souls , she alone held aloof from the sins of the flesh . Illustration : When the soldiers of the city Oas saw that their King had not the backbone to enforce his own decree when it hurt himself , they one and all took up stones , and they stoned King So-qi to death . Which was very strange , for Too-che became big with child , though she had not been with a man ! Which came to the ears of So-qi , upon his great black throne supported on a tower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the great Golgotha , which was built entirely of human skulls  --  the skulls of people conquered by the armies of Par'si'ya , over which the city of Oas reigned . So-qi shook his big belly under the lion 's skin , let slip his serpent skin headdress , and let the battle axe that was his symbol of office drop from his hand as he shook with mirth at the great and thumping lie told by Too-che . " I suppose her child was fathered by Mazda , peering into her womb with his All-light , " laughed So-qi , for in Oas it was not the fashion to worship the God Mazda anymore . The great skull temples had their priests and their sacrifices , but no more did people bow down in the temples of Mazda , or have anything but ridicule for those few who did still worship in the old way . His serpent skin headdress and battle axe scepter , too , were relics from the past . Just as the belief in Mazda . But more potent relics , by far . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Master of Life and Death , Creator of the Universe , Lord of Souls , Maker of the Law , etc . Without them he was just old So-qi , getting fatter and more stupid every day . " Bring this harlot before me , to see if she can produce a miracle to prove her child is not a common one . If she can not , she will be stoned to death at once , do you hear ! I have no time to be bothered with the lies of every sinning woman who seeks to hide her bastard 's origin . " * * * * * Asha , the philosopher who had told his king of the birth of the child , nodded his head sadly and left the presence . Why did kings have to get so blown up as to be inhuman ? He sympathized with the girl and her predicament . If it had been his to say , he would have had the child proclaimed divine a thousand times in preference to shedding one drop of her blood . But then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her water jar on her head , and her hips the focal point of all eyes in the street . Asha smiled , and took his grey-headed , bent , unnoticed figure down the back streets to the house of Too-che . As he went , he pondered gloomily on the fate of this great city under the heartless and ignorant So-qi . Surely something dreadful would happen to Par'si'ya , lying as it did at the juncture of the lands of the three mightiest kingdoms of the world . Jaffeth ( China ) , Shem ( Africa ) and Arabin'ya . Any one of them could crush them , did they get themselves organized for it . And So-qi preyed upon them all ruthlessly , knowing they could never stop warring interiorly long enough to attack him . Old Asha thought of the future , which his star studies were supposed to give him power to foretell , and of the great flood that was to come and wipe out all the old boundaries and nations . He thought of the peculiar grey-blue sky , which the Wise men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oceans of water , waiting for the time to drop the whirling water-shell upon them all . He thought of Uropa , the great land in the west , and all her peoples . He thought of Heleste , that mighty and gracious land in the North , and all her beautiful and strong and courageous people . And he thought of the two great lands of the far west , called North and South Guatama . And he was sad , for they were all to die in the great deluge to come ! But the time was not yet come . Sadly he pushed among the stalwart copper-colored men of Oas , gazing a little wistfully at the women 's proud breasts and the strong young thews of their lovers beside them . If only he were young again .... Asha sighed , and knocked upon the low , rude door of the house of Too-che. * * * * * The smile of the beautiful Too-che made him welcome , very proud to have the wise man from the court inquire after her child . " He worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim and supple as a panther to sit protectively beside the little cradle of bent ash bows lashed together with strips of hide . " He talks like a man grown , and him not yet weaned ! " " Hmmm . " Old Asha looked down upon the over-large infant solemnly looking back at him . He nearly fainted when the tiny red lips opened , and a strange , small voice , cultured and adult , said : " I am not the child you see , but your God , Mazda , speaking through the child 's lips ! " Asha pondered for only a moment , then turned in anger upon the woman , Too-che . " I pitied you , harlot , because the King has ordered your death if you did not produce a miracle . But I did not think you would hide a man behind the child 's cradle to befool me , old Asha ! What do you take me for ? " Too-che broke into tears , bending her graceful neck and sobbing to hear that the king had decreed death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's mouth . " Take me in your arms , Asha . " Feeling very foolish , but unable to refuse for some mysterious reason , Asha bent and picked up the child . " O man , temper thy judgment with patience and wisdom . " Asha knew now that it was the child 's voice truly , and at last asked : " Why do you come in such a weak and helpless guise , O Lord Mazda ? I had hoped to see a God appear in stronger shape . " " Nevertheless , through this helpless child in your arms , this city shall be overthrown , yourself made King of Kings , and I shall deliver all the slaves and strike off all the bonds from the old time . Mazda will have this city for his own , or it will be destroyed forever . " Now Asha was filled with wonder , and asked the babe of many abstruse things , receiving answers beyond his understanding . So , at last convinced , he put the babe down , turned to Too-che @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without fault . I can not go to my King and tell him one word of what this child has revealed , for I would only die with both of you as a liar and worse . You must take this child and hide him away from the eyes and the ears of the men of this city . You in your innocence do not understand the ways of kings and courts and warriors and such things . Flee , for if you are here tomorrow , you will die and your child will die with you . " Asha took himself out , then , and made his way sadly along the crowded streets to his home . There he packed up a few belongings and left to go into hiding himself ; for he knew better than to try to tell So-qi any such cock-and-bull story . Yet if he went at all to So-qi , he had to tell something , and either way someone would be doomed , if not himself . Too-che took up the babe and fled through the city by night to the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had long made love to her with his poetry and his voice from afar , and she knew he would hide her and protect her . Her heart was in her throat , because she wondered if he would believe in her virtue now that she had a child , or in her love for him when he felt that another had given her child when he had been denied the privilege . * * * * * Slender and dark-eyed and handsome he stood in his doorway , looking upon this girl who had come to him with her babe in her arms . A babe by another ! His heart was hurt , tears came unbidden to his eyes as he turned and allowed her to enter . For a long time he could not speak , the shame and the hurt and pride and the strange new sudden emotions in him not suffering him to talk . At last he said : " Too-che , I love you and I can not deny you anything . If you put this shame upon me , I will bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me as your slave . If I did not love you , I would not bear this , but I do . " Too-che saw the conflicting emotions upon his face , how his dark red lips struggled to remain firm , how his thin , wide nostrils trembled , how his eyes were wet with unshed tears , how his shoulders bowed as with a sudden burden . " Oh my dear Chojon , I have no other friend to whom I can turn  --  and that I thought of you , who has only loved me from afar with your eyes and your soft , sad songs , should tell you that I bring you no shame or insult . This is not the child of another man , for I have been with no man , ever . This is a child of the legends , a son of a God in the skies , our God , Mazda . He is a miracle , as hard for me to believe as for you , but it is true . " Too-che could not stand the unbelieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked down at the sleeping babe in her arms , saying with a pitiful voice ... " Please , little stranger who talks like a wise man , wake and tell my Chojon that you are not the son of a man , but the son of one whom no maid could resist or run away from , ever . Tell him , little one ! " And Mazda heard Too-che imploring speech of her child and made it to speak with his own voice . " Chojon , what my mother says is true . I am the child of the All-light , endowed with powers beyond ordinary men to accomplish my Lord 's mysterious purposes here on earth . Do not hold my mother the less for my birth . " Chojon sank slowly to his knees , realization stealing over him as he heard the adult words issue from the suckling babe 's mouth . The unshed tears began to pour from his eyes in relief , for he knew now that Too-che might not love him yet as she would when she learned love , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . And the miracle of the Child of a God there before him lighted up his face as his inward soul , so that he took up his lute and lifted his rich , deep voice in a joyous song  --  the Song of Zarathustra . For the legend of their people had the name of the babe-to-come as Zarathustra , and Chojon knew that its name was thus , now . * * * * * Too-che dwelt for some time in the house of Chojon , and the songs of Chojon were circulated among all the singers of the city , so that everyone knew he sheltered the Child of the God , Mazda , in his home . The songs of Chojon came at last to the King 's ears , and as one of the songs proclaimed Zarathustra as stronger in one finger than all the power of So-qi , he let out a great oath and set his soldiers to find Too-che and the babe . But Chojon heard of the search . He took Too-che and her babe out of the gates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of Listians , who are raisers of goats , and a fine , strong people . Now when the search failed to find the babe , So-qi proclaimed that every male child of the City Oas would be slain if the child was not found . And within a week So-qi was sorry , because his own wife gave birth to a little son whose life was already forfeited by royal decree unless Too-che and her child were found . And they were not to be found in all Par'si'ya . Asha , the old philosopher , who had been in hiding all this time , now came out of his hole and went to the King to give him counsel . As Asha progressed through the city , mothers with male children in their arms on all sides were making their way through the streets to the gates to flee the city . For no decree of a King of Oas may be repealed , but is law forevermore . The King sat upon his throne of skulls , gnawing his nails off his fingers , for he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law once made by a king could be un-made . If he allowed the law to be thus abused even by himself , such was the nature of his people they would have no respect for him , and might even kill him for a fool who could not enforce his own decrees when they hurt him a little . So it was that when Asha presented himself before the King , So-qi asked : " What shall I do , O Asha ? My son has smiled in my face ! " Asha was prepared for this , and answered : " Thou shalt send me and thy son and thy daughter 's son and every male infant to the slaughter pens , and have us all beheaded and cast into the fire ! Otherwise it will come true as the infant Zarathustra prophesied : his hand will smite Oas city , and it will fall as a heap of straw . " So the king appointed a day for the slaughter , and ninety thousand male infants were adjudged to death . Chojon , from the safety of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oas who went to war against babes , and it was sung everywhere in the city , and the king could do nothing about it , for it was cleverly worded , seeming to approve , though in satire only . * * * * * When the day for the slaughter arrived , there were but a thousand appeared with their babes out of the ninety thousand adjudged to death  --  all the rest having fled to the forest as had Chojon . The King saw an excuse in this to get out of killing his own son , and stood pondering how to escape his own decree . His wife , Betraj , came before him , holding out her son , saying : " Here , oh King , take thou thy flesh and blood and prove the inexorable justice of the King 's decrees . " But the King said : " Let the officers go and collect all the others who have fled beyond the walls , and until all are gathered here before me , no matter how long it takes , let the decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved the soldiers ' minds to see that their King had not the backbone to enforce his own decree when it hurt himself and they , one and all , took up stones and stoned the King to death . Asha , standing stripped for the slaughter , was made King by the clamor of the men who stoned So-qi to death . A great voice came out of the sky and announced to the people that God had given them a new and righteous ruler . Asha bowed his head and accepted the task put upon him . The people gave thanks to Mazda , the God , and Asha proclaimed him to all the city . Off in the forest , Too-che lifted her eyes to those of Chojon and thanked him for saving her son . And Chojon touched her with his fingertips , and kissed her on her lips , and the child crowed lustily to see their love . These two walked through the Forest of the Goats , Too-che bringing beauty like a spring breeze with her , and Chojon singing and touching his harp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them , announcing them to the Listians  --  the people of the forest . When Zarathustra , the infant child the woman bore in her arms , lifted up his piping voice and spoke to these rude wild people , their worship sprang into life  --  for surely these were Gods come to them . And thus , all the people gave up the worship of murder and became Zarathustrians . THE END
