txt Tobacco farmers may soon be boosting their crops some 25% or more at slight cost by appeasing the tobacco plant 's hunger for copper . T111.4 is the conclusion of the Battelle Memorial Institute here , after five years of research on copper in plant nutrition . And the study also indicates that , in some areas at least , production of cotton , potatoes , soy beans and some vegetables may be stepped up by applying copper to the soil . In the Battelle field studies copper in the form of copper sulphate was applied to the test areas along with the regular fertilizer . The amounts used varied from 10 to 50 pounds per acre . And copper sulphate costs only 10 cents a pound . The work was carried on under the sponsorship of Kennecott Copper Corp. , PhelpsDodge Corp . and Anaconda Copper Mining Co . Deficiencies Hard to Determine According to Dr. Frank A. Gilbert . Battelle research botanist , copper deficiencies in plants may be completely unrecognizable in the field even by expert observers , since reduced growth is usually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests were made on more than a hundred farms in North and South Carolina , Virginia , Kentucky , Indiana , Ohio , West Virginia and Illinois . Eighty-nine tests were on tobacco . In 63 cases the yield was increased , and in nine cases the quality was improved . Consequently , in 80% of the tests the grower obtained a greater monetary return . On one farm in Sampson County , North Carolina , the copper-treated crop gave 27% more tobacco leaf than the untreated crop . Another farm in the same county showed a 35% increase In South Carolina , tobacco production was boosted from 2% to 19% in five test plantings . Improved Quality in Virginia The maximum increase in Virginia was 9% , but this was accompanied by an increase in quality which brought a premium price . Extensive field tests in Kentucky and Indiana did not show pronounced copper deficiency in the soil , the institute said , although in many instances quality of the tobacco was improved by adding the copper sulphate . Dr. Gilbert cautioned that evidence of benefits from treating soil with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain localities is concerned . Battelle 's research on other crops has not been extensive enough to assure the significance of the results . However , experiments indicate that copper additions to fertilizer may be beneficial to soy beans , cotton , potatoes and some vegetable crops in certain areas . In , teats on cotton in North Carolina , copper additions gave yield increases from 4% to 6% in three cases out of four . Higher soy bean yields were obtained in Illinois . Dr. Gilbert explained that copper is one of a number of plant " micronutrients " which are usually ignored in crop fertilizer programs , mainly because of the lack of present-day knowledge .
