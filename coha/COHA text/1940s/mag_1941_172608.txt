MY DEAR BELLA-Arthur Kober-Random House ( $2 ) . <P> These episodes of life in The Bronx have for principal characters Bella Gross , a private secretary who will not let herself be called a stenographer ; her father and mother ; and the young man she thinks occasionally of marrying , Max Fine , a C.P.A. who will not let himself be called a bookkeeper . All the stories ( originally printed in The New Yorker and now illustrated by The New Yorker 's Sydney Hoff ) achieve the distinction of being not only funny but sympathetic . <P> The Bronx is a luxuriant weed patch on the landscape of U.S. speech , and Mr. Kober knows its every leaf and stalk . Damon Runyon thinks that Kober has " the keenest ear for human speech of any writer since Ring Lardner . " In one way Kober tops Lardner , for Lardner 's baseball players talked pretty much alike , whereas there are distinct differences-some obvious , some subtle-in the talk of Bella and Max as against that of Ma and Pa Gross . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they retain sentence structures from Yiddish ( Pa Gross , protesting a torrent of talk : " Like a machine is gung the tunks . Like a sobvay is coming the woids-tukk , tukk , tukk ! " ) . They put extra consonants in certain words- " udder " for or , " paintner " for painter , " finndish " for finish . They say " chonging " for charging , " serrisfied " for satisfied , " tenner " for tenant . <P> The young people , U.S.-born and schooled , do n't use the old folks ' " regelleh . " They say " regella . " Their mistakes belong not to Yiddish , but to The Bronx : omitted consonants ( " lease " for least , " oney " for only , " finey " for finally , " subjeck " for subject ) ; misconceptions ( " grain matter " for grey matter ) ; transpositions ( " dastric " for drastic ) ; mixed metaphors ( " Mac Fine , honestly , if there 's any figgers arounn , your nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The young people have a great American thirst to improve themselves . They are the nouveaux riches of culture , fond of words like " whence , " " whereof " and " elucidate . " A beautiful word like " osculation " serves Bella the double purpose of showing both learning and gentility . <P> Moreover , the Bronx youngsters of her generation insist on seemliness . When their social club gets together , a chairman presides and discourse is conducted by parliamentary rules .
