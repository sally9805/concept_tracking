&gt; A cork substitute ( called Fiberglas AE Board ) was announced last week by the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp . ( but not for bottles ) . Made of glass fibers pressed into lightweight blocks and sheathed in durable asphalt having a high melting point , it weighs 40% as much as cork and insulates just as well , looks nothing like it but resists insects , fungi , rodents . Significance : U.S. cork imports from Spain and Portugal have been cut off to a mere dribble , and there is a great wartime demand for cold-storage and refrigeration equipment , which will this year require some 200,000,000 board feet of cork or cork-like materials . <P> &gt; Brittle plastics can be toughened by use of sisal fibers ( a rope material from a Mexican plant ) as filler , announces Modern Plastics . Sisal is better than wood flour ( a common plastic filler ) because its long fibers mat together , better than cloth and paper because it is easier to press into odd shapes . <P> &gt; A covered wagon of basket-woven steel cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city has been invented by members of the New York police department . If the joggling bomb explodes , the meshing cables are supposed to keep its metal fragments from scattering .
