So long as the seas were free and there was free land somewhere they could do that . But this is a new kind of war.The conquerors are trying to take in all the continents and all the seas . They 're trying  --  and it 's never been tried before  --  to conquer the whole earth , and all its waterways . If they succeed , then , for the first time , it wo n't be possible to run away . All men will be slaves , and there 'll be no centers of freedom . Nowhere to run . No ocean to escape across .

The big guns of the fleet speaking in the name of our freedom-loving nations . As of tonight they hold the straits and sea lanes , making impossible the conquest of the earth by Hitler and his Japanese associates . That 's why we look towards our Navy nowadays , and hope so much from it , and listen for news of it in a hush of held breath and thumping hearts . p. 5 BIZ ( Dot dash dot dash in code effect . ) MARCH If the men of the fleet were n't always out there , in their battle wagons , cutting through tropic seas and arctic ice ; fighting storm and enemy and hidden danger , moving with the tides of freedom to the outposts of man 's hope , we 'd have this war on our front steps tomorrow .

We used to take them for granted , but not now . Now we listen eagerly to what we can learn first-hand of the Navy and how it works .

FAIRBANKS In the Navy ? Well , of course , the Navy gives you quite a variety , fair weather and foul , and eyes peering through the mist , and sextants and calculations , and the hundred and one sounds that mean freedom of the seas . BIZ ( Bosn 's pipe . ) FAIRBANKS That 's the blast of the bosn 's pipe , piping down all hands to chow . BIZ ( Anchor chain  --  low tweet of bosn 's pipe . ) FAIRBANKS Those are the turbines turning over as the cruiser slips from the harbor , under sealed orders , in the dead of night . BIZ ( Diesel engines. ) p. 7 FAIRBANKS Those are Diesel engines powering our new , trim submarines , with names like Sculpin , Skipjack , Stingray , Shark . Now you 'll hear the big electric motors humming pushing the sub along at ten knots under water . BIZ ( Electric motors . ) FAIRBANKS Then there are the torpedoes , leaving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compressed air ; biz of firing torpedo . ) FAIRBANKS Now the sound detectors , deep down beneath the water line , picking up squeals and howls and all suspicious hums . BIZ ( Highly amplified mlange of sound with an AC hum mixed up in it . ) FAIRBANKS And all the offhand sounds that have to do with fighting . This is the repair job in drydock , with the chipping hammers going , and the cranes and derricks and the riveting machines . BIZ ( Background as described . ) FAIRBANKS Then , when you 're at sea , the wind in the rigging a fairly moderate wind on a fairly moderate sea . BIZ ( Wind in rigging. ) p. 8 FAIRBANKS And , of course , a Navy does n't run itself . Behind the ships and guns and the planning and detail , the office of the Secretary of the Navy , the shore establishments , the wireless towers , the check on movements , the shipyards , the longshoremen the planning and details . The Navy takes a lot of planning ; it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it takes planning and work and hard fighting at sea . At this moment there are ships loading at night by docks in every port , busy with men and machines . BIZ ( In with sound of voices , winches , loading machinery of all kinds . ) FAIRBANKS Some of these sounds come from piers along the Jersey side of the Hudson , where the ice has come down from upstate ; some from the warm Gulf waters of Tampa , Florida , or the land-locked harbor of San Francisco ; some from a wind-swept lake boat , loading in Duluth  --  from any of a hundred American waterways  --  lake , gulf , river , harbor , island . BIZ ( Sound alone for a moment . ) MARCH Corn from Nebraska headed for Liverpool . Machine guns from Birmingham headed for Chungking . Tanks from Detroit headed for Africa . Wings from Baltimore going to Batavia . Woolens and canned milk and gasoline and anti-aircraft and the latest magazines going to Iceland . Steel and coffee and mail and fragmentation bombs going to Melbourne via Bermuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIZ ( Cross-fade to ship 's whistle . ) FAIRBANKS It looks romantic , and it looks grim , and I suppose it 's a little of both , the ships slipping away in the dark , from this port and that harbor , and sailing around the point ( Ship 's bell ) and across the bay , and out to sea , and meeting in a secret rendezvous , waiting there until all the ships have gathered  --  gathered with their crews from a dozen different lands across a dozen seas . And finally the skippers meeting in the Commodore 's office just before they put out for the long , hard voyage getting last minute instructions COMMODORE ( fading in ) : And naturally I do n't have to stress the importance of the cargoes you 're carrying . They 're needed and they 're badly needed , and they 're the stuff that 's going to help win this war , and it 's up to us to see that they get where they 're going . ( Pause . ) Now : any further questions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , sir . SPANISH SKIPPER No questions from me , Seor Commodore . COMMODORE Er  --  Captain Mackenzie  --  I believe you have the slowest ship . p. 10 MACKENZIE ( thick burr ) : She 's not a bad one , sir . COMMODORE The speed of the entire convoy will be regulated by what you can make . How fast do you think you can push her ? MACKENZIE Oh  --  with a wind behind her , we can count on twelve knots . I guess , sir . SOUND ( Laughter from the assembly . ) MACKENZIE But with a head wind I 'm afraid maybe no more'n ten or nine . ( More laughter . ) O ' course , if my chief engineer wouldna argue with me all the time maybe we could push ' er faster . ( More ad libs and laughter . ) COMMODORE Well , Captain , you realize that we 'll get there just as soon as your ship does , and no sooner . MACKENZIE I will do the best I can , sir . COMMODORE I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who 's commanding the convoy escort , will say a few words . LOVEJOY Well , I just want to say that we 'll give the best possible protection at all times , and for your part , you can cooperate by keeping your formation and following out all instructions to the letter . Just remember to keep on the alert , because that 's going to make it easier for all of us . We 've got the guns and the men and you 've got the payload , so you just do your part and we 'll do ours . p. 11 COMMODORE Are there any questions you want to ask Captain Lovejoy ? BROWN Yes  --  what happens , Cap'n , if a ship has to drop out for repairs . Do we still get protection ? LOVEJOY I 'm sorry , but that ca n't be done . If you break down , you 're on your own . The safety of the majority is the hard and fast rule of the convoy . COMMODORE Any other questions , gentlemen ? SOUND ( No answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , gentlemen  --  good luck , goodbye , and may we all meet again . BIZ ( Noise of the meeting breaking up , chairs , feet , ad libs . ) FAIRBANKS Just a detail  --  just a detail of what goes on every day of the week , in many places , on many seas  --  a detail of the vast and bloody canvas of the bitter struggle . Each successful convoy is an item in the reckoning  --  an item in the final tipping of the scales . MARCH And all that , even before the gun reaches the man who does the fighting . I can see that we have to look a long , long way ahead . FAIRBANKS Yessir . That 's the size of it . p. 12 MARCH How long would you say , Lieutenant ? FAIRBANKS Well , if it lasts longer than our lives , our children will have to fight it . We ca n't give up in either hemisphere . We 've seen what the Japanese and the Germans do to conquered nations . MARCH Some people refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAIRBANKS We could lose if our Allies lose . We could lose if Britain and Russia and China went down . Our Fleet would have a hard time keeping the oceans open if the British were n't on the same job in the Atlantic and Pacific and Indian Oceans and in the Mediterranean  --  and if the Russians were n't in command of certain sea approaches  --  why , if our Allies fell , we 'd be the last center of freedom in the world . MARCH Those seamen out there on the ships , are they aware of these things as they go about their work ? Do they know that they 're one of the last bulwarks between civilization and darkness , or are they casual about the matter ? FAIRBANKS You ca n't be casual out there , I assure you of that . The first time you hear the call of battle stations , something happens inside you that you never feel anywhere else on sea or land . It 's like ice and fire together in your veins . Your eyes see farther and your ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a fight or cold water . p. 13 MARCH How does it feel to stand watch on the deck of an escort vessel , waiting for this sort of thing ? FAIRBANKS It can be different at different times . MUSIC ( Sneaks in . ) FAIRBANKS I can remember days when the sea was calm and the whole convoy rode along like a string of ducks , under a blue sky . And I can remember nights and days on end that were a nightmare of storm and smashed gear and torpedoed ships . Some of these things are n't pleasant to remember . You just did the best you could and hoped you 'd be one of the lucky ones to come through.It 's a tough job , but nobody 's kicking about it . It 's tough , and the men know it 's tough . MARCH By the way , Lieutenant , how do the sailors on the warships feel about the men of the merchant ships ? FAIRBANKS Great respect . Those birds really have their courage with them . Most of the skippers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they never quit . If they lose one ship they apply for another , and complain if they do n't get it right away . One howling black day we had dropped astern to round up a freighter that was lagging behind . SOUND ( Fade in sound. ) p. 14 FAIRBANKS The old Norwegian who commanded her had lost his code book overboard , so we ran close enough to hail them . SOUND ( Wind and water . ) COMMANDER ( calling ) : Ahoy there ! If you do n't close up we 'll have to leave you astern . CAPTAIN O.K. , Cap'n ! Keep steaming ! COMMANDER What 's the matter with you ? CAPTAIN Trying to patch a leaky boiler . COMMANDER How long 's it going to take ? CAPTAIN Maybe ten or twelve hours ! COMMANDER We 've received a fair report of subs thirty miles east of here . You may run afoul of ' em if you do n't get out of the area ! CAPTAIN You better go along with the rest of them . We can swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men . ) Well , there 's a good skipper . CAPTAIN Yes , sir . COMMANDER Hope we do n't lose him . MUSIC ( Transition . ) MARCH You went on and left him ? p. 15 FAIRBANKS We had to . MARCH What happened to him ? FAIRBANKS I do n't know . I never heard . ( Pause . ) But , mind you , these are not exactly usual happenings . I 've known many nights when we were running along on a sea so smooth you could almost hear the porpoise breathing as they rose alongside . There 'd be no lights , of course , and the officers would stand using their highpowered night glasses in the effort to see all the ships in the convoy and be sure they were in position . They 'd be talking quietly about something far off from the war . MUSIC ( Brief horn passage . ) OFFICER ( very quiet ) : I missed that game . I was out West .

SEAMAN ( in phone ) : No , sir , I have n't seen her for ten minutes . COMMANDER Very well . Well , then he had to bone up to pass his midyears . He 's with the tank corps now . Talker , ask Fire Control if they 've seen the Paul Jones . SEAMAN ( in phone ) : Fire Control , aye . COMMANDER Can you see the Paul Jones ? SEAMAN ( in phone ) : I think she 's ahead the Oriental , sir , just a little abaft that big tanker . OFFICER What year was that last big game of his ? COMMANDER Thirty-four . That was a swell team . Last good line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . COMMANDER Do you remember the Harvard game when Barry  --  TALKER ON BRIDGE Code message from squadron commander , sir . Three subs reported well ahead and on the bow of convoy . We 're picking up depth charges on the sound detector . BIZ ( Faint distant cannonading. ) p. 17 COMMANDER Forward lookout , there . SEAMAN ( in phone ) : Bridge , aye , aye . COMMANDER Could you see gunfire flash ? SEAMAN Yes , sir , dead ahead . Very faint . COMMANDER Sound general quarters . OFFICER Aye , aye , sir . Bugler ! BIZ ( Bugle and bosn 's pipe sounds general quarters . ) VOICE All hands to battle stations . SOUND ( A rush of feet on iron rungs and stairs . ) MUSIC ( Punctuation . ) FAIRBANKS Sometimes we stood waiting at our stations for hours and nothing happened . Sometimes too much happened . The sinking of a ship is something you 're not likely to forget , try as you like . That 's the kind of thing men face when they take places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARCH And the submarines , Lieutenant , do n't we sometimes make it pretty tough for them ? FAIRBANKS A good number of them are on the bottom , I can tell you that . MARCH I got a story of a submarine kill straight from a friend of mine  --  a coast guardsman . Want to hear it ? p. 18 FAIRBANKS Sure . MARCH Well , I 'll tell it to you anyway . Seems he was look-out on a patrol ship this winter coming down the coast from Labrador . He 'd just come off duty one night and ( fading ) we were having a mug of beer together in a little restaurant . SOUND ( Clatter of dishes . ) MUSIC ( Effect of a cheap jazz band on juke box . ) COAST GUARDSMAN Nothing ever happened to us for six months , and then this happened . You wo n't believe it , and I would n't blame you . MARCH Hurry with that beer , will you , Sadie ? COAST GUARDSMAN I did n't believe it when it was there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jinx ship . MARCH Always getting into trouble ? COAST GUARDSMAN No  --  never getting near it . Always missed everything that happened . MARCH ( laughs ) . COAST GUARDSMAN Then one morning I was standing watch just about dawn ; smooth sea , foggy weather , could n't see more than ten feet any direction , and all of a sudden a wind hit the fog and lifted it like a bed quilt , and there was a whole flock of three submarines not more than a hundred yards ahead . Three of them , just lying to there , charging batteries . p. 19 SOUND ( Somebody lays down a fork . ) MARCH Did they get you ? COAST GUARDSMAN They almost did . Why , I almost fell through the deck when I seen them . MARCH What did you do ? COAST GUARDSMAN As soon as I could make my mouth work , I yelled , " Subs ! " and then things happened fast . We picked up speed and began to fire . Hit the first sub four or five times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got one with a hit on the conning tower before it could get under water , and then we dropped charges on the last one . MARCH Sink it ? COAST GUARDSMAN Yup . Three subs in one morning ! And we were the jinx ship nothing ever happened to ! ( Fading . ) Only it happened . It happened to me ! MUSIC ( Transition . ) MARCH That was what Kipling would have called good hunting . FAIRBANKS Good hunting , all right  --  only he should never have told you that story . The less talk , the less chance of the enemy finding out something it 's anxious to know . MARCH I get it . Now there 's one thing I 'd like to ask you , Lieutenant , if I may . p. 20 FAIRBANKS Go ahead . MARCH The people of the United States are n't used to war . Certainly they 're not used to the long hard pull of a war that begins badly and can be won only by holding on . When they hear of Axis victories in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libya , hear of more sinkings in the Atlantic and of German ships escaping to raid our shipping , some of them begin to ask why we ca n't make a stand somewhere , why we ca n't concentrate forces and smash through on one ocean at least . What answer can be given to that ? FAIRBANKS The answer is that we have to hold on in every ocean and so far we have no margin of ships or men or planes to waste . Our Navy and the British Navy are spread out thin these days over the high seas , attacking , defending , raiding , escorting , holding on stubbornly and desperately till the day comes when they can deal decisive blows . Even now our planes from aircraft carriers are hitting the Japs hard in the South Pacific . The sky , as well as the sea , must be captured and held , and made free . MARCH I suppose if there are n't enough planes or ships , then someone must decide where we 'll use best the ones we have . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult decision sometimes . p. 21 FAIRBANKS It 's a series of difficult decisions . It means choosing to withdraw in one place so that you wo n't lose in another . It means letting men fight on unaided sometimes because you ca n't afford to send help . Because another position must be held , and you 'd have to weaken it if that help were sent . You should hear the messages that come from all over the world , reporting progress , hoping for reinforcements , noting the arrival or loss of supplies .

FOURTH VOICE Twenty-eighth , off East Coast . Sighted sub , sank same . FAIRBANKS That 's the way it is now . The men who fight on our side are in some places outnumbered and lacking ships . MARCH Tell me , Lieutenant , was it your intention to make it look grim for its effect on morale  --  or is that just the way it works out ? FAIRBANKS Anybody who still thinks it 's going to be a pushover should just do a little of the pushing and see for himself . It 's going to be a hard , long battle , and no fooling about that . MARCH We know the Navy can take it and dish it out , too . But how does the Navy feel about how the Home Front is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about that . They 're doing their job and they 're assuming everybody else is doing his . After a man 's lived on a destroyer or a battleship or an aircraft carrier for a while , he can fight a battle along with the day 's work . And traditions are strong in the Navy . Every sailor knows about John Paul Jones , and those who know their history remember p. 23 MUSIC ( Orchestra in . ) FAIRBANKS what Captain Pearson testified at his court martial for losing the Serapis to John Paul Jones in the Revolution . CAPTAIN PEARSON " Long before the close of the action , gentlemen , it became clearly evident that the American ship was dominated by a commanding will of the most unalterable resolution , and there could be no doubt that the intention of her commander was , if he could not conquer , to sink alongside . And this desperate resolve of the American captain was fully shared and fiercely seconded by every one of his ship 's company . " MUSIC ( Sea chanty ; two verses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's also the Navy of today . Such slogans and the actions they represent have become a tradition as deeply ingrained as the love for ship and service . In the great battle for the earth , which is now in the making , the greatest battle of all time , for the greatest stakes , for the earth and all that 's in it , including our lives , the Navy is not going to give less than everything it has.I 've watched our men night after night , day after day , going about their work . To them it 's mostly just work , and not over-pleasant . They look forward to land as a child looks forward to holidays . In war , the sea is not exactly romantic to them . They 've learned to live with it , somewhat as a tiger-tamer lives with his tigers , but they do n't trust it . Every time they make port they consider it a battle won .

We know that we can depend on you , and we want you to know that you can depend on us . We had a lot of illusions about this war , but we 're losing them fast . We thought we could n't be attacked , we know now that if we once lost control of the seas we could n't hope to escape invasion . We thought we could win by helping our Allies ; we know now that we 're at the middle of the quarrel , that we 're enemy number one of the Axis , and must fight it out with them ; that we must out-produce and out-think and out-guess and out-shoot them on every sea .
