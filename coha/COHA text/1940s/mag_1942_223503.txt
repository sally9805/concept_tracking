A hero came home from Bataan . Lieut . John Duncan Bulkeley , a hero of the Subic Bay sinking of a 5,000-ton Jap supply ship and commander of the PT boat squadron which whisked MacArthur out of the Philippines , arrived in San Francisco last week , and was flown across the continent to New York . People were waiting to see him : his wife , his mother and father , his 19-months-old daughter , whom he had not seen since last August , his five-weeks-old son , whom he had never seen . There also were cheering neighbors , U.S. flags fluttering in the doorway of his apartment house in Long Island City-and the press . <P> The New York Sun reported microscopically : " The hero who never faltered in daring raids seemed slightly shy as he took his wife into his arms under the gaze of the large group of reporters . " <P> Lieut . Bulkeley made stiff little speeches for the press and the newsreels : " He General MacArthur believes that with a couple of hundred of them PTs we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very brave , pugnacious fighters . . . . We feel the Navy is trying to do a good job in the Far East . . . . " <P> Then he elbowed his way into his apartment house . " There , " said the Sun , " his waiting mother wrapped him briefly in her arms . Next he caught up and kissed his daughter , Joan . " He posed , frozen-faced , while photographers snapped him getting reacquainted with Joan ( see cut ) . Asked his favorite dish , he said , " I do n't care what it is so long as Mom cooks it . " Said the 30-year-old hero of Bataan : " I 'm going to spend every minute I can with my family . " <P> Next day , by invitation , he went to Borough Hall , received a scroll from the borough president . The 62nd Coast Artillery Corps Band played Anchors Aweigh . That evening Hero Bulkeley made a broadcast . <P> With him were Lieut . Robert Kelly and Ensign George E. Cox Jr. , fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy , just as frozen-faced.
