A most sinister and most beneficent metal is quicksilver , whose properties mystified men for 4,000 years . A deadly poison in some forms , it was once mined chiefly by slaves , convicts , syphilitics . It is used in the making of felt hats , anti-barnacle marine paint , medications , many another product . Without its uniform sensitivity good thermometers would be costly and rare . Its hypersensitive crystals ( mercury fulminate ) have detonated most of the world 's bombs . <P> Eighty-five percent of the world 's productive veins of quicksilver ore ( cinnabar ) lie in Spain and Italy . The great Spanish mine of Almaden , worked at least since Hannibal 's time , was a prime pawn in the late Spanish war . A European cartel , pioneered by the Rothschilds , controls the world price . No. 1 world consumer , the U. S. uses 25,000 to 35,000 flasks * a year , normally buys half its quicksilver from the cartel , produces nearly all the rest itself . <P> Western U. S. quicksilver mines were sizable producers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of 90 or so mines in the U. S. today , most are marginal producers , their rate of production highly responsive to the cartel 's price . Newest U. S. mine in commercial production is the Idaho Almaden near Weiser , Idaho , discovered by a sheepherder in 1936 , leased and run by Lawrence Kendall Requa , son of Herbert Hoover 's late friend and booster , Mark Requa . Vice presidents of Idaho Almaden are Sons Allan and Herbert Hoover Jr . Producing around 500 Ib. of mercury a day , their mine has made money from its start . <P> Oldest U. S. mine is the New Almaden near Santa Clara , Calif . Opened nearly 100 years ago , New Almaden was a potent factor in California politics , had yielded more than 1,000,000 flasks worth $65-75,000,000 before it closed in 1926 . Since then New Almaden has yielded a few small tonnages to short-term lessees , but most of its 100 miles of tunnels have been empty . Last week the great New Almaden was on the point of changing hands . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacetime , 15% of world production goes into fulminate for explosives . Another war use : calomel for soldiers ' bowels , ointments for their skins . Last summer , up from a 1932 low of $46 a flask , the price of quicksilver was idling between $83 and $91 , just below the price most U. S. mines need for profitable production . When war broke out , it shot up to $147 , by February had reached $185 , has stayed near there since . Warring governments have clamped the lid on news of their needs and reserve supplies . Panicky U. S. consumers , none of whom is known to face an actual shortage , have helped to keep the price up . This price has stimulated old sleeping New Almaden itself .
