Last fall , Brooklyn 's Branch ( " The Brain " ) Rickey tossed a bomb into baseball and stuck his fingers in his ears . He signed up Jack Roosevelt Robinson , a Negro shortstop and onetime football star at U.C.L.A. , for his Montreal farm club ( TIME , Nov. 5 ) . It was the first time a Negro had ever played Class AA ball without being passed off as a Cuban , a Mexican , or an Indian and there were a good many skeptics who said that it would n't work . By last week some of them would admit they were wrong : Jackie Robinson was the International League 's leading batsman ( .378 ) and Montreal 's standout star . <P> The first test rangy , graceful Jackie Robinson had to pass was a session at the plate in spring training . On the mound were some fastball pitchers , some of them Southerners . There was a feeling that one of them might try " spinning his cap " ( pitching at his head ) . They did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballplayers and he Was jittery . <P> He flunked the batting test . Afield he showed a minor talent , too . His aim was erratic and he had to be moved from shortstop to second base for the easier peg to first . All he seemed to have was dazzling speed on the bases and a modest , earnest attitude that quickly put him in solid with his white Montreal teammates . <P> Southern Cross . Because of its Negro player , Montreal had to cancel a Southern exhibition tour . But in the first game of the regular season Jackie belted four hits including a homer and he lost his jitters . <P> He expected trouble at Baltimore , lone " Southern " city on the circuit , but got more at Syracuse , where the players ragged him a bit . Says he : " When I did n't pay any attention , they dropped it . " He stays at the same hotel as his teammates in every city but Baltimore , rides in a compartment by himself on trains , gets along well with Manager Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 100 games with Montreal this year , he has made 133 hits , stolen 33 bases , scored 100 runs . With him as its top attraction , Montreal 's paid admissions on the road jumped to triple last season 's . <P> Although not a power hitter ( he has only three home runs ) , Robinson makes up the difference by beating out bunts , stretching singles into doubles and doubles into triples . Last week , with Montreal 15 games out front and the parent Brooklyn Dodgers puffing to stay one jump ahead of the Cardinals , Boss Rickey asked himself whether he should call Robinson up to the majors but apparently thought better of it . But even if Robinson got no chance at a Brooklyn uniform until 1947 , he had already accomplished his mission . Other big-league moguls were already hunting around for Negro rookies of promise .
