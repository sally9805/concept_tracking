India 's week began and ended with deceptive quiet . In the cooling monsoons of central India the Congress party Working Committee met with Mohandas Gandhi at Sevagram . Monday was Gandhi 's day of silence , but Tuesday morning the silence was broken . Correspondents were summoned to receive the committee 's decision . In a high-pitched , whistling voice , the 90-lb. archenemy of the British Raj declared that , from now on , the people of India would be in open , nonviolent rebellion against British rule . <P> By Wednesday morning the resolution had reached New Delhi . The Viceroy 's Council met in the long , high-windowed council room , darkened against the glaring sun . What they would do was a foregone conclusion . The British Government of India does not possess the authority to commit Constitutional suicide ; at best it could refer the decision to His Majesty 's Government at London . This it did . <P> In New Delhi nothing except muted headlines indicated that India was approaching a rendezvous with history . Heat-drugged , half-nude Indians still slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grassy lawns of Government buildings and homes of pukka sahibs . From miles away bright British flags could be seen snapping in the north wind above the copper dome of the viceregal palace , as gayly and unconcernedly as if the British Government were not facing the most serious threat to its power since the Mutiny of 1857 . <P> The Threat . The core of the Congress resolution demanded that Britain withdraw politically from India , and threatened to use all the possible nonviolence of the people to compel Britain to withdraw . The resolution did not alter Gandhi 's position that he does not wish to interfere with United Nations military forces in India ( TIME , July 13 ) . But Jawaharlal Nehru explained that nonviolence envisaged more than industrial strikes-it would be a general strike , peaceful rebellion . Nehru 's thesis was simple : only Indians could organize India for war , because anybody could do anything better than the Government of India today-that is a fundamental axiom . " <P> " I think this may be illegal , " said one British official after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , by the law of India , Nehru , Gandhi and every member of Congress was subject to arrest . Gandhi and Nehru , both astute lawyers , knew the law . But both they and the British knew that India 's problem was not to be solved by legalities . <P> How far did Congress represent India ? Never had Congress entered mass action with so much of its own press against it . The Bombay Chronicle , Lahore Tribune and Madras Hindu assailed the Congress policy . The great Madras leader Chakravarti Rajagopalachariar ( " C.R. " ) , who recently resigned from the Congress , was speaking against its policy publicly , though hissed and booed . Dawn , the organ of the Moslem League , which represents some , but far from all , of India 's huge Moslem minority , was crying that Britain 's yielding to Congress would result in " the rule of the jungle , anarchy and disorder .
