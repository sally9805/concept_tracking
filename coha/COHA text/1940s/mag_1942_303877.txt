Listeners within broadcast range of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts have lately made a surprising discovery : there are often better programs on the air from midnight until 7 a.m. than during the daylight hours . This came about because after Pearl Harbor a number of powerful stations on both coasts were ordered to stay on the air around-the-clock to aid the Fighter Commands in case of air raids . <P> Aware that night work in war industries has swelled the owl audience , most of the stations now make a real effort to put on good programs for early morning listeners . <P> There are exceptions . Some stations merely hired " disk-jockeys " to ride herd on swing records , in the traditional milkman 's matinee style . WJZ , New York , evolved a six-hour , all-musical program in which every word except the news flashes is sung . A chorus , jam band and harpsichord render the station breaks in such senseless jingles as this : <P> Lo listen to the key Blue station Even though the hour be late . Prithee lend thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . <P> Other stations-among them , WABC and WOR , New York ; KFI , KNX and KHJ , Los Angeles ; and KIRO and KJR , Seattle-do better . They often blend a mixture of news , swing , classical and semi-classical recordings and transcriptions of good network sustainers . Many of the stations report rapturous letters from workers on the night shifts , but sponsors have n't come a-rushing . <P> Celebrities &; Furs . One of the few post-midnight programs to find favor with both workers and sponsors is Moonlight Saving Time ( WOR , New York , 2 to 5:30 a.m. , daily ) , a pre-war innovation that celebrated its first birthday last week . Moonlight is slanted at night workers , with news twice an hour , transcriptions of important fight broadcasts , This Is Our Enemy and similar shows . <P> The man who makes Moonlight shine is young , handsome Jerry Lawrence , former actor and amateur wrestler at San Diego State College . He rounds up live talent for the program , and in recent months has introduced Peter Arno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " Celebrities Corner " feature . <P> One of Moonlight 's biggest sponsors is Furrier I. J. Fox . Survivors from a tanker torpedoed off New Jersey last winter told Lawrence about how they had spent a long , cold night in a small boat hearing him praise the luxury of furs . <P> Midwest stations have paid much less attention to the radio wants of night workers . The best late show beamed at war workers in the 1,500 plants which operate 24 hours a day around Chicago is Night Watch over WIND , Gary , Ind . One of the pioneer all-night shows , started in 1934 , Night Watch consists of news , rebroadcasts of important speeches , records and patter . <P> As yet , no station has decided that the millions of men now home in the morning and afternoon might like to hear some thing besides soap operas .
