" It looks like I have two battleships on my hands , " said Presidential Secretary Stephen Early to members of the press one day last week . " And you know the rule against any mention of ship movements . " <P> Steve Early 's figurative reference to battleships , while well and humorously meant , was figuratively unfortunate . The battleship has thus far proved to be the booby of this war , and Mr. Early was alluding to Winston Spencer Churchill , 67 , and Franklin Delano Roosevelt , 60 , flagships respectively of the vastest Empire and the mightiest Republic in all history . At the moment when Flagman Churchill crossed the Atlantic ( not in a battleship but in an airplane ) to have a long visit with Flagman Roosevelt , both the majestic Empire and the fabulous Republic were taking a hell of a licking . <P> While the lovely June days and nights slipped over them in their undisturbed privacy , their fellow subjects and fellow citizens could only hope that they would be equal to the magnitude of the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly . Second front ? Egypt ? Shipping ? Alaska ? Messrs . Roosevelt &; Churchill had presumably talked about everything - that is , about how to win a war that , so far , they had been losing . <P> One thing was starkly apparent to newsmen in Washington . Optimism , much of which had emanated from the White House ( whether or not it was intended ) , began to fade early in the week , as even dull minds began to suspect the phony reports from Cairo and London about the fighting in the desert . When Mr. Churchill arrived , people said : " We did n't think it was that bad . " <P> On the fourth day of their conferences , the factual headlines read as follows : <P> JAPS TAKE KISKA <P> TOBRUK FALLS ; ROMMEL TAKES 25,000 PRISONERS , SUPPLIES <P> PIERCE SEVASTOPOL LINES <P> VANCOUVER ISLAND SHELLED <P> ENEMY SHELLS OREGON COAST <P> That afternoon an official communiqu from the White House said : " Complete understanding and harmony exists between all concerned in facing the vast and grave tasks which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it would have been difficult to settle by correspondence have been adjusted by technical officers after consultation with the President and the Prime Minister . " <P> If complete harmony existed between Messrs . Roosevelt &; Churchill , right outside the White House doors harmony was not so apparent . Said the New York World-Telegram : " . . . We hope they will be more successful than at their last conference in unifying the fighting commands . " <P> On one question there had quite evidently been disagreement for weeks and months : the " second front " attack on Western Europe . Demanded by Stalin , propagandized by Lord Beaverbrook , it got the " H-H " * months ago , which presumably meant the backing of the President . But if Churchill is for it , it is something which he has evidently been forced to accept . No soldier man has the final yes or no on this momentous decision . But U.S. generals were evidently more eager than British , as evidenced by the activities of Lieut . General Brehon Somervell ( TIME , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
