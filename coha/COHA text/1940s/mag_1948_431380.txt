Joe Gilligan ? that is n't his name ? lives in a middlesize industrial town in an $8-a-week light-house keeping room , with a pretty young wife who expects a baby in six months . The place is dark , rickety , and not worth the price . Under normal circumstances the Gilligans would n't be caught dead there . But of all the things turned topsy-turvy in the past ten years , this matter of living quarters ? if any ? is probably still farthest from normal . For a while last month it looked good to Joe . As a veteran , he had long been on the waiting list for a twobedroom house in a new development giving veterans first call . And here was a letter from the builder-owner 's office saying you 're next , your house is waiting for you . Blessing their stars that their break arrived ahead of the baby , the Gilligans hurried round to see the house . It was just like every other house in the row ? treeless , lawnless , street still unpaved . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could afford to start buying on time would make it cheery . They drew a long breath . How much ? " Seventy-five dollars a month , " the agent said .  | Joe was dismally sure he had heard right . But to stall for time he asked again and heard the same thing . " Holy smoke , " he said . " I ca n't do it . " Edna gasped . Glancing guiltily at her , he saw she looked as if somebody had slapped her . " But , honey , " he said , " we have n't got that kind of money . Look . " He picked up the agent 's pencil and pad and began simple arithmetic , which he knew would give very depressing data . " I make $1.20 an hour . Forty hours a week . That 's $2,496 a year . Now look , honey ? withholding is $239.20 . Social security , $24.96 . Dues , $19 . That leaves us $2,212.84 a year and the baby coming and furniture to buy . If we pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Honey , we ca n't do it . " Writers and editors usually fight shy of figures . Figures are supposed to bore readers . Those figures , however , do not bore the Gilligans . Back in their dingy room that evening , they went over them again and yet again . Seventy-five dollars for enough house for their needs still meant forty cents out of every takehome dollar . The owner-builder could have explained that , with building costs what they are now , this house , which might have cost $4,500 in 1940 , actually had cost $7,500 . Definitely lower rent would leave him virtually no return on his investment . Why should he subsidize Joe Gilligan ? If Joe were indignantly to point out that his middleaged uncle pays only $45 for a similar house elsewhere , the landlord would answer that that house was built at much lower cost in 1938 and is rent controlled by federal law at the 1942  | rental ; whereas this new house is not controlled , because it was finished after February , 1947 , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate veteran making a little more than Joe will grit his teeth and pay that seventyfive dollars . Or take the Hales in a similar town four hundred miles away . Harry Hale , wife , and two children have a four-room apartment upstairs in an elderly dwelling house . Harry 's pay check of $90 every two weeks from the fire department used to make their $55 rent barely possible . But rising food and clothing costs put the Hale budget in a bad spot . And then last summer the landlord suggested very firmly that they sign a lease till January , 1949 , on the voluntary 15-percent-increase deal passed by Congress . Rent control would die in February , 1948 , he said , and this would protect them against further rent increases for the coming year . If they did n't sign , he made it clear , he might well sell the building out from under them . They signed . So now , of every three cents Harry takes in , one goes to keep that not too satisfactory roof over their heads . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that signing that lease automatically " decontrolled " their apartment , which may put them at the landlord 's mercy in 1949 , whether rent control lives or dies . They took this bit of news about as hard as Joe took the words of the agent when he said , " Seventy-five dollars . " " You can always cut down on food , " says Doris Hale . " Even milk , I guess . But rent ? " Ten years ago they could have cut down on rent , too , by putting up with less space or moving from their lowermiddle-income part of town to a district starting to get slummy . But low-income quarters are now as hard to find as any others . Everything from the walk-up tenement with outside plumbing to the penthouse atop the Highbracket Arms is occupied by people afraid to change because it would be so tough finding another place at any figure . IN JOE 'S town in " normal " times , 15 percent of rental " dwelling units " ? houses , apartments , single rooms ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to pick and choose from . Today 's vacancies are under 1 percent . The local housing authority has over 1,500 applications on file and small hope of filling them . A great corporation expanding its local plant has postponed bringing in 2,000 men because there is no place , literally no place , for them and their families to live . Nor is the Hales ' town markedly better off . No wonder both families feel hemmed in , put upon , whipsawed , and generally pushed around . In the postwar price rise , public dismay centered on skyrocketing food costs . Rent hurts only once a month , whereas the price of pork chops hits the lady of the house every time she shops . But sneaking behind the excitement about groceries , masked by unavoidable false impressions created by national statistics , lullingly slowed for a while by continued wartime rent control , rent has now definitely  | joined the upward-and-onward movement . Though food prices may drop sometime , if Europe gets back on her feet and American food production increases , rent is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Census figures already show a rise of some 23 percent since 194 ( in the rents people pay . Even the Bureat of Labor Statistics , which , working on different statistical basis , found little rent rise during the war , now shows rents ur 5 percent in four months of the latter half of 1947 ? a rate of 15 percent a year True , industrial wage scales and food prices have jumped still more . But millions of Americans relatively neglected in the big wage rises ? old folks on pension : and savings , white-collar workers and teachers , veterans on GI benefits ? lack the slack to absorb even this rent rise , let alone what may come later . Even the industrial worker , whose pay has had handsome raises , wonders what good it did him , with food jumped over the moon and now rent creeping up . A QUARTER of income ? or " a week 's pay for a month 's rent " ? was the handy formula on which millions of Americans were reared . ( There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper income brackets often could lower that proportion . In 1918-1919 , which were warboom years , too , Americans ' rents averaged only 14% percent of available income , not quite a sixth . Everybody agreed , too , that nobody should try to buy a house costing much more than twice probable yearly income . For many families in low and middle brackets , much of that has gone or is going glimmering . The costs of war brought the federal income tax to bear on low incomes for the first time , on middle incomes much more heavily , crippling the week 's pay and stepping up the proportion of rent to intake . And some states have income taxes , too . Besides , without effects appearing in official figures , the rent shoe now pinches hard in " concealed rent rises . " For instance , many a tenant pays out of his own pocket for the paint or repairs the landlord normally supplies . And the chiseling minority of landlords have , of course , made quite a business of soliciting or accepting side money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's illegal but it goes on , sometimes as a " signing bonus " ? $100 per room is the accepted scale in some places . Or the tenant gets a receipt for rent at the controlled figure while paying the landlord another $15 or $20 a month in unrecorded cash . In one new housing development recently investigated , the owner had collected steep cash bonuses from at least 30 of his 135 tenants . He is being sued for three times the amount of the bonus , as the law permits ; the tenants stand a very good-chance of collecting . But totals of such payments kept quiet on both sides never will be known . Smarter chiselers trying to play it safer force tenants to buy a few sticks of furniture for perhaps $500 , as condition of getting fixed up . Such deals have been advertised openly in newspapers . Or the landlord may say he 'll rent me the place if I can find him a new car at list price . That is my cue to go into the gray market , pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over to the landlord at list price , and swallow the difference . However disguised , such bribes ,  | frequent on all rent levels , amount to sharp increases in actual rent paid . Desperate families forced to buy because they can not find a rental , experience another kind of concealed rent rise . In prewar times 11 American families rented for every 9 owning or paying for their own quarters . That is now neatly reversed ? only 9 rent , 11 are owners or mortgagees . A trend toward homeowning should be a good thing ? but not when a crucial proportion of the new owners of homes are biting off more than they can chew . A banker in Joe Gilligan 's town recently screened veterans applying for GI home loans and concluded that , on the average , they could not afford more than a $4,500 house . The kind of house purchasable today for $4,500 ? if you can find it ? is probably on the verge of collapse . " Ive been looking for something to buy because I ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . " When I go to see something I might afford , I do n't need the address . All I need is what block it 's in . You can tell too easily ? the one for sale is the rickety old rattrap with the front steps yawed away from the porch , and the last time it saw a paintbrush was the day Lindbergh flew to Paris . " So he may go out on a limb with a house costing $7,000 , figuring that at least it 's a roof for as long as he can maintain payments . But actually those payments are desperation rent , not the partial investment they should be , and the savings he puts into the down payment are probably gone for good . So many people doing that sort of thing is not healthy for the national economy . And the disappearance of so many such families from the rental picture distorts national statistics on shelter costs . MOST of that recent rise found by the Bureau of Labor Statistics probably came from those 15-percent voluntary deals , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another factor is the appearance of newly converted rentals to which rent control does not apply . A little of it came from cases in which landlords , proving to rent-control authorities that their costs had risen , were accorded rent rises to match . It all contributes to the first of the month 's becoming progressively gloomier . Those 15-percent leases have occasioned much misunderstanding and finagling . We found among tenants interviewed a startlingly widespread and utterly erroneous impression that " they " had passed a law allowing landlords to demand blanket increases of 15 percent on all controlled rents . Such misinformed people were duck soup for unscrupulous landlords . People really should read the papers more attentively and listen more carefully to just what the radio newscaster says and does not say . Actually the law merely provided that a 15-percent increase in leases might be entered into strictly by " voluntary agreement . " The landlord not only could not force an increase , he could not even offer inducements for signing or use threats on a tenant preferring to stay at the controlled rental . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Promises to redecorate at last ? sometimes forgotten once the lease was signed ? were popular . One imaginative character sweetened the 15-percent rise by offering all tenants signing a free  | chance on a de-luxe television set . Coercion took various forms . A certain owner sent a circular letter to all his tenants saying that those not signing would have their apartments repossessed on February 28 , 1948 , " or as soon thereafter as permitted by law . " Actually that meant practically nothing if rent control continued . But it alarmed tenants ill briefed on the law concerned . Or a tenant reluctant to sign for 15 percent would wake up next morning to hear a For Sale sign being tacked on his front door . For a landlord can sell rental property when he likes ; a new owner who wants to occupy the place himself can evict the tenant when his tenure expires . Many a renter aware that inducements or threats were illegal nevertheless hesitated to go to the mat with the landlord , because he preferred not to get that gentleman 's dander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the tenant miserable with small inconveniences hard to prove and harder to get relief from . Bulbs disappear from dark halls ; stoppedup plumbing goes unrepaired for weeks ; one landlord warned a family he was having some repairs made , but they were on no account to inconvenience themselves by moving out ? he insisted on their staying . Then he began the repair job by removing the roof . Some landlords were probably honestly unaware that use of inducements was illegal . Particularly in the small-time class , they have been almost as slack as tenants about informing themselves about the ins and outs of rent control . A widow owning a small layout of converted apartments complained bitterly that " they " had frozen her rents while costs for labor , fuel , taxes , and so forth had risen . She was astonished to hear that appeal to the local rent-control office might get her rents raised to correspond , a thing she should have known and acted on long before . Even when small landlords make such applications , said a rentcontrol office , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of them . They act as if it were n't in their interests to get their rents legitimately raised . " BACK on the other side again , no tenant we found knew that a landlord renting a controlled property is legally required to show a copy of the registration fixing the rent that he has on file with rent-control authorities . We found a bright young secretary who had gone two months without daring to trouble her landlord about a dead electric refrigerator ? she said she was waiting till he came round with a 15-percent lease and then would make repairs a condition of signing it . And an apparently rational young wife , asked if she knew national rent control was still in effect , answered , " I would n't know about that . I do n't come from around here . " Whether the cause is carelessness or lack of funds and personnel , the federal Office of the Housing Expediter has done a very poor job of public information . With the public so confused , the unscrupulous minority of landlords could tell tenants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure to expire in February and only signing a 15-percent lease would protect them . Wishful thinking probably helped many a landlord believe that himself . That was always a dubious prediction , however ; and toward the end of 1947 it was very plain indeed that Congress would renew  | rent control with few significant modifications . Even real-estate men , most of whose spokesmen detest rent control , admitted that by last November . In an election year , they said , Congressmen would never dare vote for a rent-raising freefor-all that , at a moderate guess , would up their constituents ' rent an average of 25 percent . Another pointer came from the local advisory boards of representative citizens appointed by state governors for each rent-control area . One of their jobs is to recommend to Washington decontrol of their area when it seems justified . Few such recommendations were made . The vast majority of such boards , made up of the same stripe of people as those on selective-service and rationing boards during the war , strongly recommended continuing rent control to avoid chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where enough housing is available to restore the prewar style of equal-footing bargaining between landlord and prospective tenant . On that basis decontrol has been effected so far only in certain areas in the trans-Missouri West , from which mushroom populations attracted by temporary war jobs have gone back home . All sides admit that if , by some fluke , federal rent control does die , individual states will immediately put into effect practically identical state control laws . New York already has such a law in operation . Several others have one on ice for emergency use . So the tenant can take it for granted that rent control along present lines will be with him a long time . That will be an awful blow to those who took their landlord 's word for its certain decease . THE LANDLORD 'S case against rent control has points . He asks why shelter , which is his stock in trade , is held down to 1942 prices when food , clothing , automobiles , soap , and movies are all sold at what the traffic will bear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant has risen with prices in general , while Mrs. Jones in that cottage on the corner pays the same rent she did before Pearl Harbor . Proponents of control say that , even with most rents still frozen , the landlord does all right because he no longer has losses on vacancies . The apartment building that used to run a fifth or a quarter empty is now chockablock , every unit producing revenue , more than compensating for increased costs . With turnover of tenants low , the landlord is spared much of his normal expense for agents ' commissions and fancy redecoration as tenant bait . That is probably true ? of landlords as a whole . But in many individual cases , particularly of owners with only a few rentals , all controlled at 1942 levels , rent control has probably handed landlords a beating . It is easy to understand the irritation of a landlord getting only $35 a month for a controlled house , while a decontrolled rental across the street brings in $60 ? the only difference between the two properties being that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rented before then . Certainly the scrupulous landlord is likeliest to suffer . The apartment-building owner who kept his prewar rents at minimum to attract tenants into full occupancy and figured profits to match , who  | went out of his way to keep tenants year after year with lavish services and redecoration , who refused to blackjack them into 15-percent-increase leases by wishful guessing and threats , is the man frozen rents have most penalized . So nobody is happy ? not Pop and Mom with that For Sale sign leering at them every time they come home , or J. Henry Entwistle , the real-estate man down the street , or Pop 's and Mom 's veteran son , whose marriage may break up because he ca n't find a place and who has to live with his old folks and his wife with hers . Such doubling up is the most acute symptom of the current housing emergency . There are 2,200,000 such families suffering the inconveniences of living with other people in cramped quarters , eager to absorb all the new housing units at reasonable rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population started the great jam . Since Hitler went to war , the number of Americans has One up 10 percent , 13,000,000 fresh people needing quarters , twice the rate of increase in the years 1930-1940 . And in spite of the housing shortage , the marriage-license business continues to boom , and at least 500,000 new families appear yearly . No harm in that if building of new dwelling units kept pace . Only it does n't , and has n't for years . Such construction reached a peak in 1925 ? a full generation ago ? fell off , and was never again adequate to replace dying buildings and provide for population growth . During World War II construction fell still farther behind . With construction costs now so high , people with money to invest are chary of putting it into enough housing to erase the national housing deficit for lower and middle brackets . Government housing would have the same fundamental handicap . It would cost much the same as private building , and the public would have to pay , backhandedly in taxes if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the only discernible villain in the picture ? comes from the strange backwardness of the people who actually create housing . The methods used by makers of building materials and accessories , contractors who boss the jobs , and labor that hooks up pipes and pounds nails are about as out of date in the year 1948 as stagecoaches would be on a modern highway . Mass production and intelligent use of new techniques and . materials produce the American automobile , washing machine , airplane , and can of tomatoes at the world 's lowest cost in man-hours . Hence the American can afford more of such things than anybody else . But improvements paralleling those have not been widely applied to building , though such application would be very practical . The new car you have just acquired ? if you were lucky ? cost much more than it would have in 1939 . But even in that year , the Ford Motor Company estimated , to build one of their cars by hand out of unshaped materials , as houses are still built , would have cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used efficiently in making roofing , pipes , washbasins , and so forth . But they are marketed by a hamstrung and hidebound system , so costs are far too high at the point of installation . The makers ' insistence on protecting a complicated system of jobbers and dealers is the joker . The builder with  | mass-production ideas can not get the advantages of mass purchase as big chain stores do in the grocery field , for instance . Think what your car would cost if General Motors had to shop piecemeal for all of its parts at the retail hardware store . Most private housing is put up by small-time contractors operating on what any other major industry would call a shoestring , which bars them from mass operations that would make houses cost far less . How much would your husband pay for a suit if , instead of getting it via the mass-production garment trade , he had it hand-tailored by a man who made perhaps ten suits a year ? Well , for a guess , $250 instead of $50 . And the small contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of which stopped making sense two generations ago , no two of which agree on what is safe or efficient in any given climate . Finally , building labor usually operates under union rules that , intended to safeguard jobs for carpenters , plumbers , or painters , actually stifle millions of potential housebuilding jobs that would keep them all busy for years . It is n't just that unions as well as building codes resist such laborsaving ideas as prefabrication of houses . In addition , the unions ' idea of a fair day 's work has shrunk steadily . Many plasterers , for instance , turn out only half as much per hour as : hey used to manage without pushing . Rules requiring unnecessary men on the job are rife . Building is the only industry in the country in which output per manhour has dropped sharply in the last generation . So at every stage housebuilding encounters crippling costs . The unions blame manufacturers and builders . The builders blame unions and manufacturers . The manufacturers blame unions and the small-time character of the building industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all the while population outstrips available dwelling units . LET NOBODY tell you this is a failure of free enterprise to supply public needs . It may be free . It certainly is n't enterprise . Nor do complaints about this fourbarreled brake on building come solely from radical , chronic kickers . The most mordant recent survey of the subject , substantiating all the above and more , came from the Wall Street Journal , probably the least radical paper in the land . Building needs a dozen persons combining the manufacturing imagination of Henry Ford with the drive and diplomacy of Oliver Cromwell . But even if enough such men appeared tomorrow , it would take 5 to 10 years to catch up with existing backlog and future population growth . During that time the American family is in for a chronic housing-and-rental headache . The theoretical question , " How much rent should you pay ? , " can be answered only by : " No more than you have to . " And that calls for a new alertness and realism . Most families probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that wo n't protect them if they do n't take the trouble ? as too few have done so far ? to know and stand on their rights . For months during 1947 rent-control offices had available a beautifully clear series of questions and answers briefing both  | tenants and landlords on all they needed to know . But every other phone call made it plain that few of either side had bothered to seek such authoritative information . In some areas , labor groups reprinted and distributed such material wholesale . In your towr , civic organizations and women 's clubs would do well to imitate that when rent-control authorities have a revised edition ready . You can make sure whether or not the premises you rent are controlled under the new law ; if they are , find out what the control rent is and what facilities and services the landlord listed as , called for by your rent . Sign nothing without consulting either your local rentcontrol office ? which is probably within fifty miles of you ? or a lawyer well up to date on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signing bonus on a controlled rental , give it to him in the presence of a witness outside your family , and enjoy yourself suing for triple damages . However , do n't go on the assumption that all landlords are trying to chisel . A fair proportion are themselves suffering from upped costs of operation and can not make a profit . And without a profit , who wants to stay in business ? The landlord does n't want to , any more than you would want to . Above all , as government control is your ace , get over that allergy to governmental red tape . " Too much bother , " said too many tenants when we suggested appeal to the rent-control office . Time and again , at a rent-control office , a tenant with a legitimate complaint gets handed a form to fill out and drifts away muttering , " Well , I 'll think it over and come back for it " ? and never reappears . Filling out government forms is never fun . But it is slightly fantastic to let dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra hundreds of dollars a year . THE REALISM the next few years will demand applies specially to family policy about money . First , stop thinking in terms of rent as such . Instead , think of all-inclusive " shelter cost " as a major heading in a list of regular spendings . The others would be food , clothing , taxes , security ( life and fire insurance , hospital , medical , and disability insurance , doctor 's and dentist 's bills ) , equipment ( furniture and laborsaving devices , except the car ) , transportation , recreation ( including vacations ) , maybe education , for families able to contemplate private schools and college , oddments like cigarettes and cosmetics . On this basis shelter cost takes in not only what the landlord collects , but also what you pay for telephone , electricity , cooking and heating fuels , household supplies , wages for outside or inside help ? this last again for the minor , ity who can find and afford domestic help . Then stop thinking of your pay as the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . Then do a Joe Gilligan , only in more detail . Pick a non-holiday month , and keep accurate tabs on how much actually goes for what ; this will keep you from kidding yourself with guess estimates . Add purchases of clothes and equipment for the past year , and divide by twelve . With such heavy going ahead , you need to know just how much gasoline each cylinder of the family motor is demanding . If you do know in accurate detail , your family is very much of an exception . Such a check may well turn up leakages  | or spots where , slightly to ease the shelter-cost pressure , you can squeeze down a few monthly dollars . Maybe the bus would cost less than driving to work . Bus riding did n't hurt you when gasoline was rationed . Maybe ? this needs saying tactfully ? in spite of the constant reminder of fantastic food costs , the kitchen is wasting or buying too many high-cost items . Even with meat prices so far upstairs , Americans are still eating more meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacationing at home . No such suggestion is pleasant to consider . But go at it as if your income had just been cut 15 percent , and see what results you can get . Even if you ca n't manage paring down to any appreciable extent , doing a Gilligan will keep you from kidding yourself , and you are thenceforth in a position to get into the black a little if and when costs of food and clothing ease off . Rent probably wo n't ease . But if building does catch up to the point where you and the landlord are nearer an even footing in bargaining , you will be far better off with an accurate notion of the relation of your intake to the cost of that roof over your head . It would be ; silly to say , " Do n't worry . " In a. jam like this rent situation , only a blissful idiot could take that advice . But the thing to do is to use your worry to spur you into playing the cards you have as intelligently as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
