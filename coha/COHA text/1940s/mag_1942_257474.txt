What we say tonight has to do with blood and with bone and with anger , and also with a big job in the making . Laughter can wait . Soft music can have the evening off . No one is invited to sit down and take it easy . . . . <P> With these words Radio cast aside its diversity for a half-hour last Saturday night to give Americans a dramatic meditation . It was prefaced with an introduction by President Roosevelt ( read by Archibald MacLeish ) . The four major networks and many independent stations-some 700 stations in all-contributed the time . It was the first of 13 shows suggested by the Office of Facts and Figures , designed to instruct and confirm the American spirit , and entitled This Is War ! <P> Writer of its angry opening lines and all the rest of it was Norman Corwin , who did the Bill of Rights anniversary program ( TIME , Dec. 29 ) . After working so hard on that show that he had a series of nosebleeds , Corwin was easing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him to Washington . Corwin brought to the job the best gifts to be found in radio-a spritely mixture of mockery and love for his medium . No radio writer has kidded it and used it so well at the same time . ( Last month his best CBS scripts were collected in a book with a preface by Carl Van Doren. * ) <P> When he went to work with OFF , Corwin was in sympathetic company . OFF 's chief , Archibald MacLeish , has written radio plays himself . OFF 's dark and glittering Bill Lewis was the CBS vice president who made a famous remark about radio 's audience : " Even if it 's good , they 'll listen . " With the desire these men have for excellence and truth in " propaganda " programs , Corwin devoutly agrees . Said he last week , " I have a terrific sense of the dignity of a half-hour of God 's time . I feel that anything which smutches that time is inexcusable . " <P> Corwin 's show was no smutch . Because serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncontrolled acting , a few poor pomposities of style ) were disproportionately jarring . But the script sang with the defiant tunes of people and machines , and the narrator , Navy 's Lieut . Robert Montgomery , handled well the address at the end to the people of the United Nations : <P> " Take heart ! Resist much ! Fight how you can ! We are building for you , we are on the move . . . . " <P> This message actually went out to the world . Played by separate casts in Spanish and Portuguese , the program was broadcast by short wave to South America that night . Done by other casts in other languages , it goes out this week to the peoples of the East and West . <P> <P> * Thirteen by Corwin ; Holt ( $2.75 ) .
