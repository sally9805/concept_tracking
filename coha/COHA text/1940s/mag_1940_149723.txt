Giving no location , announcing simply that his program was " Germany Speaking , " the Freiheitsender commentator , who may have been speaking from Switzerland , mocked Gring on the failure of his second four-year plan , which ended last week , contended Hitler had overrun Austria , Czechoslovakia , Poland , Denmark , Norway , the Low Countries and France because ersatz food and gasoline had failed him , declared the only people not weeping in Germany " are the rascals who are now in power . " Winding up its program , the Freiheitsender remarked : " Sometimes we think the Nazis are overdoing it . Even the most peaceful and most calm of us might not stand it much longer . " <P> A short while before the Freiheitsender cut loose , Radio Paris , which the Nazis permitted the French to operate , was suddenly suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynaldo Hahn which had as its finale the lines : " After the day of storm comes the summer sun . It is love that will give us back our liberty . " Fairly screamed into the mikes of Radio Paris by an enthusiastic chorus , the lines gave the Nazis a nasty turn .
