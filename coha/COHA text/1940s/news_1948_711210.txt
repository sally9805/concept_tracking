txt Mayor O'Dwyer intervened yesterday as the Transport Workers Union , CIO , moved up the deadline for its threatened strike against the city 's principal private transit companies to tomorrow night . On instructions from the Mayor , Theodore W. Kheel , director of the City Labor Relations Division , called representatives of the union and the Third Avenue Transit Corporation to meet in his office at 11 A. M. today in an effort to avert a tie-up on lines that normally serve 1,800,000 riders a day in Manhattan , the Bronx and Westchester . It was indicated that Mr. Kheel would take similar action in the case of the New York City Omnibus Corporation and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , which transport a daily total of 1,400 , - 000 riders in Manhattan and Queens , if a deadlock developed in their relations with the union at a conference scheduled for tomorrow afternoon . Union Stands Firm on Demands The warning that the union was prepared to call a strike as early as tomorrow night was given by City Councilman Michael J. Quill , president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its New York local , at the end of a forty-fiveminute meeting with officials of the Third Avenue company yesterday morning . Both asserted that the union had no intention of compromising on its demand for a general wage increase of 30 cents an hour , pension benefits , an employer-financed welfare fund , increased holidays and vacations and other concessions . John M. , president of the Third Avenue System , said after the meeting that the company felt it would need an eightcent fare . instead of the seven-cent rate established by the Mayor and the Board of Estimate for cityoperated buses and trolley cars , to assure its future financial stability . Mayor Noncommittal on Fare The company executives went from the meeting to City Hall to confer with the Mayor , ostensibly to lay their fare-increase request before him . At the end of the hour-long session , in which Mr. Kheel and William Reid , chairman of the Board of Transportation , participated , the Mayor declined to make any comment on the fare he might recommend for the private lines . The Mayor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confer with Mr. Kheel today in an effort to agree on " what would be a fair rate of pay for the workers . " He suggested that such factors as wage scales for comparable employment in other cities in this area and thei cost of living should be taken into account in establishing a fair pay ' rate for the Third Avenue employes . The Mayor refused to be drawn into any discussion of what would constitute " a fair rate of fare " for the private companies . He did not indicate what the companies could do to put into effect a higher wage in the absence of assurance that a higher fare would be authorized by the Board of Estimate and the Public Service Commission . Company Proposal Rejected Before his meeting with the Mayor . Mr. reported that the union had rejected a company proposal that wage negotiations be carried forward on a conditional basis , with any increase to become effective when and if the company obtained approval for an increased fare . The union 's reply , according to James Hodes , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that the company put the pay rise into effect as soon as agreement was reached and use its higher wage bill to bolster its fare case before the Board of Estimate . " This would entail a firm commitment that could ruin the company if we failed to obtain an increase in fare , " Mr. Hodes observed . The Mayor , who told representatives of American Federation of Labor unions at City Hall yesterday that he planned to increase the wages of all municipal employes except transit . workers by $250 a year , said no specific wage rise for employes on the city-owned subway , elevated and surface lines would be included in the executive budget that comes before the Board of Estimate today . The rise for other employes would be about 121/2 cents an hour . The Mayor told reporters that he expected the Board of Transportation to hold hearings on the amount of increase that should g3 to transit workers . Asked if he believed the board would take into account the same factors he had outlined as appropriate for consideration by the private lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayor replied that he would not be surprised if the board dealt with the problem in that way . He added that he had made no specific suggestion on the subject because of his " respect for the sovereignty of the Board of Transportation . " Suggestions that the city intended to limit the pay rise for its own transit workers to not more than 20 cents an hour have led the TWU to concentrate its pressure for the full 30-cent increase on the private lines , where it is not hampered by the no-strike restrictions of the Condon-Wadlin Law . Union Opposes Fund Diversion In a letter sent to the Board of Estimate yesterday , the union renewed its complaint against any diversion of the funds obtained from the higher subway and bus fare to pay for obligations incurred by the city in past years . The union asserted that the increased funds available to the city would be ample to pay for a 30-cent increase to workers if they were not subjected to what the union characterized as illegal " cannibalism . " Differing estimates of the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a seven cent fare were given yesterday by the union and the companies . On the Third Avenue system , the union contended that the fare rise would give the company $9,200,000 a year in extra revenue , whereas the thirty-cent pay demand would raise its costs by only $3,000,000 . These figures were disputed by Mr. , who said the company expected a rise in revenue of $6,588,000 , under a seven-cent fare and $9.800,000 under an eight-cent rate . He noted that the company had an operating deficit of $3,048 , - 000 last year , and estimated that the union 's pay demand , without taking into account the rest of its program , would raise its payroll by $3,500,000 . Edmond C. Collins , vice Ares , ident of the New York City OminOpus Corporation and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , said the New York City company was preparing detailed figures ' for presentation to city authorities and was unable to tell at this time how much of a fare increase it would require . He expressed doubt that the company would meet with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union . The Fifth Avenue company already operates under a ten-cent fare and no rise is contemplated there . Two smaller Manhattan bus companies are involved in the current fare-wage tangle . They are the East Side and Comprenhensive Omnibus Corporations , which operate six lines carrying 150,000 passengers a day . Their executives are scheduled to meet with the union Thursday .
