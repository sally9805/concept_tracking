BLOSSOM.FRANK CIST.E.A ... pg . 22 Letters to The Times Britain 's Task Held Heavy Labor Program Regarded as All but Impossible of Achievement To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In all the world-wide discussion of the amazing triumph of the Labor party in the last general election in England there has been little or no mention of a fact so simple , so obvious and yet so fundamental that it seems to have escaped attention almost entirely if not altogether . It played little or no part in the election oratory . It escaped newspaper comment . It was not mentioned in the voluminous outpourings of Professor Laski , whose verbose and'Plausible utterances revealed even while they concealed  --  or sought to conceal  --  his naive ignorance of the facts of life in the realm of economic affairs . It is the fact that if the party which has come to power so suddenly if not so unexpectedly carries out its program of rehabilitating Great Britain , rehousing her displaced population and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied in the world , they must somehow , somewhere find the money to carry on this tremendous work of re-establishment . To accomplish that herculean task Great Britain must have exports ; to have exports she must have production at such a rate and at such prices as will enable her not only to regain the markets she has largely lost but to open new markets for her products . It would appear from the vague and inconclusive reports of the new leaders which are accessible to us that this is to be accomplished by a miraculous process known as " nationalization , " with the management of factories , railways , mines and especially the Bank of England to be carried on by those now in charge of these activities but under the direction of the new Government . We Tried It But can any intelligent person believe that by this simple formula Great Britain can rise once more to the position she once occupied ? Can anyone believe , especially in view of a similar experiment with our own railroads during the first World War , that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British railways which have long hovered on the brink of bankruptcy they will be somehow made solvent , that they will carry more passengers and goods , that they will turn deficits into profits ? Does anyone believe that by " nationalizing " the iron and steel industries , the textiles , even the mines , that they will manage to produce more at less cost than they have done in the past ? Least of all , does anyone believe in the childish notion that by " nationalizing " the Bank of England this great organization will be able to provide by some miraculous process the funds necessary for this tremendous operation ? There was a time when Great Britain by the ingenuity of its inventors and the talents of its industrial and financial leaders stole a march on the rest of the world and established her dominance of manufacturing by the Industrial Revolution . There was a time when , emerging from the Napoleonic struggle , the opening of new markets in the rest of the world , especially in South America , " called a new world into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a time when by the invention of the railway and the steamship she once more stole a march on the rest of the world and consolidated the position she had won by the new means of transportation . There was even a time when by the discovery of gold and of diamonds in Australia and South Africa she was able to bolster her failing economy . Golden Days Gone Those times are past . No new inventions separate her from competition with the rest of the world . No new markets are open to her which are not also open to her competitors , among which her own dominions are now to be numbered ; no new means of transportation available to her which are not also available to others . If common report is to be relied on , her social revolution has been largely accomplished , for it is said that the fewer than two million of her people who have $1,000 to $2,000 a year have increased to more than five million , and that of some 1,800 who had more than $25,000 a year there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even if the incomes of those eighty were divided among the rest of the population each man 's share would be scarcely more than microscopic . England , in comparison with what she once was , is poor . She must have money ; and if history teaches us anything it is that money is not made by any political miracles , nor terminology , nor ideologies , but by intelligence , ingenuity and hard work . Money and Men Needed And there are three things more to be said about this political upheaval . The first is that , apparently , Great Britain is relying in large measure upon the United States to underwrite her recovery , as that country underwrote the recovery of Germany after the first World War  --  to her profound regret . The second is that there is nothing new in the Labor program . It has even a certain archaic sound . All parties for forty years have embodied some of its proposals in their programs . The " nationalization " of the Bank of England was virtually accomplished five years ago by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd George voiced much of the present proposed programs of the Laborites . The third thing is still more remarkable . It is that , in effect , the Labor program differs but little if at all from what we know of the domestic policy of the late Nazi Government , " nationalization , " housing and all  --  and if that be treason make the most of it ! Finally  --  and most important of all ? where are there to be found men to accomplish this miracle ? We are told on every hand that this is the age of the " common man , " but it is obvious that the task that the Labor party has set for itself is not to be accomplished by common men but by uncommon men , in fact by uncommonly uncommon men , and so far as may be judged from what we know of those now swept into power the list includes no such men among its members , for , as we all know , the qualities needful to win an election are far from those needed to administer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Laborites . W. C. ABBOTT . Cambridge , Mass. , Aug. 29 , 1945 . Unity Held Our Great Need Anglo-American Cooperation Regarded as Important to Peace To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Now that lend-lease arrangements are coming to an end , may an ordinary British citizen voice to the people of America the heartfelt gratitude of us all for an act of unparalleled generosity ? The willingness of the United States to support so fully the action of your great President Roosevelt in carrying through this vast undertaking of sacrifice and fellowship will never be forgotten on this side of the Atlantic . Perhaps it is worth while recalling that if America and the British Cornmonwealth of Nations had stood solidly together in the years immediately preceding 1939 , and had decreed then and with no uncertain voice that wars shall cease forever , the history of the past six years would have been very different . Is the need to stand unitedly together any less now than it has always been ? The future destiny of mankind , if it is to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly cooperation . Can this fact , even if it is a platitude , be stressed too often or too strongly ? I fought through the European war a quarter of a century ago and endured the agony of watching the flower of our manhood stricken to the grave . My sons have fought through the war just ended and realize , with me , that we might not be here to tell the tale had America remained neutral on either occasion . Before memories become dimmed by the stress of post-war problems , let the voice of the common people in all English-speaking lands be raised and heard in that unity of spiritual strength which can abolish war from the face of the earth and lay the foundations for just and lasting peace . W. TUDOR POLE . London , Aug. 24 , 1945 . Suggestions for Traffic Relief To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It would be a great comfort to know that the City Fathers have made some definite plans for curing the traffic disease which will soon again threaten New York with slow strangulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contribute any material relief . The authorities who control our traffic and transit suffer from the strange delusion that the only directions in which people have to go anywhere in a hurry are north and south . As soon as one heads east or west the errand ca n't possibly be urgent . And so one gets no help at all either from rapid transit or from the traffic lights . If the City Fathers will get busy and plan underground tunnels under our chief crosstown arteries , with stairway connections at ' the principal avenues , they will have taken the one most effective measure for the radical cure of our traffic problem . Two other measures should be taken for immediate relief  --  a change in the timing of traffic lights and the strict banning of all parking during busy hours on all main arteries and other selected streets in between . If such measures are not put into effect soon , we are headed for a traffic congestion which will exceed anything we knew before the war and will shatter our fond belief that New York is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Aug. 31 , 1945 . Some Reports Challenged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Dare we accept at face value the current charges that the Soviet Government is forcing upon the people of Bulgaria , Rumania , Hungary and the Baltic states ? and allegedly assisting ' Tito to force upon the Yugoslays  --  economic and political measures which are said not to be desired by the majority of the people in those countries ? Is it not possible , and even probable , that the journalists , Allied officials and radio commentators sending in these reports are  --  perhaps quite unwittingly ? transmitting the views and desires of the upper-class minority with which they have contact and which is more articulate than the mass of the common people ? That this may well be the case is strongly suggested by a reading of the many circumstantial reports appearing in the Austrian Labor News concerning the present state of public opinion in Austria . When the Germans were driven out of that liberty-loving country popular sentiment was strongly pro-American and anti-Russian . Today , after several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contiguous zones , Russia now is decidedly the more popular preference . These little-publicized facts about Austria point significantly in the direction of something amiss in the current reports discrediting Russia in other countries . An alert sector of American public opinion is already challenging them . FREDERICK A. BLOSSOM . Washington , Aug. 29 , 1945 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE : TIMES : To extent to which Government , everywhere are going to be or are be . ing urged to go in interfering , each behalf of its own home industries , the free play of normal world forces it the economic field was underlined by s letter by Emanuel Celler in your i- of Aug. 28 . He objects to " England ' : ' sterling bloc pool whereby Englani practically precludes India * ? * * ant other sterling area countries from buy . ing our goods , " and he suggests tha : " we will make loans to England , v.- , will lend-lease to her , but let her fir ; , : , open sterling area markets to goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sup . posing that if India could retain dollars she would be a normal market for our goods . The United States is the usual ultimate destination for at dollars . But what real harm does it do us if England does milk India of these dollars and thus " preclude he from buying our goods " ? If Britain does not herself use tiles dollars , when she gets them from India , to buy United States goods , it is only because she uses them to pay her clonal debts . This source of payment , this means of maintaining her credit arouses Mr. Celler 's indignation and hE would deny it to her as the price of further loans by us to her . Exchange Controls Not New Hymen I. Malatzky , in your issue t ! Aug. 27 , and Philip Cortney , in that of Aug. 20 , join in demanding discontinuance of exchange controls by England as the price of further loans . Exchange controls are nothing very new . To take one small illustration near home , they destroyed the chief export trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then her principal market , Italy , refused to free foreign exchange for purchase of Canadian dried codfish . Such controls are among the weapons , offensive and defensive , being used by Governments in trade warfare ; one of a long list including tariffs , quotas , inspection rackets , customs delays , subsidies of exports , subsidies of shipping , cartels , Government operation , loans to force exports , exchange control , exchange depreciation , loans to prevent exchange control or depreciation and so on . Does prosperity require the use by Governments of such weapons ? We have one answer in the trade between our many States . When Kansas has to pay for the shipping of wheat and money tightens in Kansas no clever Kansas economist rises to protest that her " internal " prices are being sacrificed to her " external " prices . She goes quietly ahead and balances her area accounts , automatically , buying only as she sells , forming a market for " foreign " goods only to the extent of the value of her wheat exports , without exchange restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no barbed-wire boundaries punctuated with armed customs guards to enforce tariffs , without retaliatory counter-measures by the forty-seven other States and without any idea ever entering anybody 's head that all these interferences are indispensable or even useful . If she has a crop failure and is forced to borrow to tide her over , she pays in the wheat crops of succeeding years and no one shuts them out . Prosperity Is Harmed These interferences , so far from helping prosperity , actually hurt it . They create an additional unpredictable political risk which deters the erection of factories for international markets except as unusual profits promise insurance for more than ordinary risk . With the hazards multiplied , stagnation spreads and we are likely to face political unrest , socialism , and even fascism in countries like England which are dependent on foreign trade . Viewed from the narrow standpoint of trade warfare , it is natural to want to deprive England of her weapons , leaving us free to use ours . But why not deprive all countries of their governmental weapons ? Under our Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the nations could forego them . Why not sweep them overboard together ? A sound peace can not be built on an unsound foundation . FRANK CIST . Brewster , Mass. , Aug. 30 , 1945 . Our Own System Advocates ! We Might Suggest International Tr ? On Basis of That in States Tribute to the Red Cross To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK TIMES : I would like to pay a tribute to the American Red Cross . In July , 1944 , I removed my home from London to Berkshire to protect my small son from the flying bomb attacks . Three weeks ago , in the early morning , our house was destroyed by fire . The destruction was so rapid that we were unable to salvage anything , and escaped only in our night clothes . As the building was of timber we were unable to insure , and so lost everything . We went to the W.V.S. and they fitted us out with clothes for ourselves , our son and our new baby . When we examined this clothing we found that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has made me realize the help that this society has given to thousands of Britishers who lost everything in the raids , and I would like to say " Thank you .
