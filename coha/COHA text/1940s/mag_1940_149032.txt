Summertime is headache time for the parents of many a U. S. moppet . Small fry with no lawn to mow nor soda-pop stand to keep them busy find time sticky on their hands . At Massapequa Park , L. L , swarthy , stocky Bernard Byrne , 15 , and sandy-haired , stringbeany Donald Blood , 14 , bored with summer idleness , decided to join the Canadian Royal Air Force , help fight the Battle of Britain . On Sunday they marshaled their cash reserve-$1.25 , which Don urged out of a toy bank at home-and set out for Canada . They did n't intend either to walk or hitchhike . <P> While an eight-State police alarm was spread to find them , Benny and Don hid by night in an abandoned ski shack , for two days scoured the airports of Long Island for an unguarded plane . Just before dawn Wednesday morning they spotted a small red-orange cabin monoplane standing in front of a hangar at the Nassau Airport . <P> With Benny confidently at the controls they swooped safely off the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compass , charted a course for Canada . Then he found an old newspaper , in which he read that private planes were forbidden to cross the Canadian border . All right , then , they would go somewhere else . Benny turned the plane toward Florida and a career as a " crop duster , " a few minutes later noticed the gas tank going dry . <P> Down they went for a perfect landing in a cow pasture . Their last 75 bought four gallons of gas at a nearby filling station . But Benny lost his beginner 's luck on the second takeoff , bounded from a knoll into a clump of apple trees , pancaked back to earth , shattered the propeller , mangled the landing gear . <P> Half an hour later , Peekskill police found the two wide-eyed , frightened fliers washing in a lake . At headquarters they cleared up a five-day-old mystery . Police had never understood why a Curtiss Junior had been found damaged at Fitzmaurice Field one morning . During the evening Benny and Don had taken it up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for a slightly damaged undercarriage . <P> Growled angry Parent Elmer Blood , thinking of the long months before school starts : " I 'd like to see my boy work it off at the airport . I 'd like to see him get every bit of the dirty work there until he 's worked out enough to pay for the damage . " Angry Parent Bernard Byrne mumbled a threat of spanking . A generous judge in the Nassau County Children 's Court ordered Benny into a correctional institution , held Don for further consideration .
