Birthday . John Joseph Pershing , his 80th . After Franklin Roosevelt had presented him the only military award he had not previously received , the Distinguished Service Cross , the erect , silver-haired , kindly-faced old man walked into his darkened War Department office . On its walls hung oil portraits of the five U. S. Generals of the Armies : Washington , Grant , Sherman , Sheridan , Pershing . On its neat , massive desk stood a single memento : an old World Series baseball with fading autographs . Quizzed by a battery of surrounding newshawks , he had slow , measured words of hope for the British . Later , in a broadcast , he had a sober , grim warning for Americans : " We must face the facts of today . . . . The danger is imminent . ... To meet it we must pledge ourselves anew to fulfill our obligations to the nation , and again avow eternal devotion to the principles of liberty and justice upon which this nation rests .
