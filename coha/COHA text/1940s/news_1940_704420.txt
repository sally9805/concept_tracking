txt An elevated highway , three to four miles long , by-passing downtown shopping districts and connecting Sumner Tunnel with south-and west-bound express roads out of Boston , was proposed today by Henry 1 . Harriman , Director of Planning for the Metropolitan Planning Commission , as the one " logical solution " to the traffic conditions which are said to be driving business out of the city . Caught between his office at the New England Power Association and the railroad station on one of his flying visits to the Hub from Washington , the Dean of Boston planners fell easily into his favorite subject of traffic congestion , called upon Bostonians to stop fooling with futile street widenings and face its traffic problems squarely with a " sound , immediate solution . " The solution he held to be an elevated roadway starting close to North Station , swinging down Merrimac Street to Cross Street connecting with Atlantic Avenue near the Quincy Market Storage Warehouse , then running down Atlantic Avenue past the South Station , along Albany Street to connect with an improved Blue Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the first time , he said , Boston would have a connecting rapid transit link between highways penetrating to the south and north of the city . Key Project The elevated road will be a key project in a program of traffic relief to be proposed shortly to Mayor Maurice J. Tobin and the Boston PlRnning Commission , possibly 13 ) , the City Planning Commission or the Metropolitan Commission . It is known that the Mayor will call a meeting on Jan. 25 for the organization of a corn- mittee composed of representatives of all traffic agencies , to consider the heretofore unanswerable whys and wherefors of Boston traffic . Mr. Harriman referred to the Old Colony Parkway , Worcester Turnpike and Jamaica Plain course of Route One of the major outlets to the south of Boston . The Newbury-port Turnpike , North Shore Radial to Lynn and the Northern Arteiy penetrate northward . Between these north- and south-bound units In the metropolitan highway system lies Boston 's central shopping area with its narrow , crooked streets which Mr. Harriman believes do not lend themselves to obvious rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , an elevated highway will take four times the volume of traffic as a surface road of similar dimensions . And four times the available facilities is what Boston requires to iron out its traffic pattern . Mr. Harriman believed that the downtown district . which is only a nude across from Dorchester Bay to the Charles River , is too small to provide needed facilities for traffic . Land values are too high to take space away from business and et% e it to traffic , he pointed out . Bence. his insistence upon a two-level road which will not take away from existing business space , yet I will take traffic out of the heart of Boston as fast as it pours in . Tempo Increased In other words , the tempo of traffic will be increased , said the planning expert , to the point where business will be more profitable , Mr. Harriman revealed that the Planning Commission was now at work on a program for traffic relief in Greater Boston that will prove as comprehensive as the Whitten thoroughfare plan of 1927 , much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of which has been pushed to completion within Boston proper . In this program , an elevated highway will be stressed as one of the major projects , although Mr. Harriman 's personal opinion is that the elevated road should be the first project attempted . " At 30 miles an hour , " Mr. Harriman stated , " a motorist could cover the entire downtown district in five minutes on an elevated road . Cost would be about $5,000,000 , and every million spent on so-called expedients will only take so much away from the real solution . If Boston wants to save the downtown district , it must Make itself accessible to traffic and not attempt to keep it out . " The planning authority and Trustee of the Power Association made it plain that he was expressing his own opinions and not that of the Planning Commission or any other agency . He said an engineer recently asked him why Boston could not build the elevated roadway last , with other less expensive improvements being made first . Mr. Harriman 's answer was that the elevated road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not put the money for other projects into the main solution . All the other projects , he held , will not substantially diminish the need for the elevated highway . Action Elsewhere New York and Chicago have both based their latest traffic relief programs upon elevated roads , he said , with the result that these cities are now beginning to see a measure of daylight through the dark streams of vehicular traffic . Boston must either follow the example of New York and Chicago or business migrations out of the downtown district will become serious , he said . Mr. Harriman 's own corporation , the Power Association , moved Isom Broad Street to its present new location in Park Square because of traffic congestion , he continued . Park Square is now beroming a settlement area for former mtown business houses . Boston University , he said , has gone out on Commonwealth Avenue . Vacant buildings in Kenmore Square are being taken over by companies that would lather not settle in the downtown districts . Others are moving well out into the subui bs.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
