Fortnight ago the most widely audible of radio 's comedians decided to rule out the rough- &-tumble; cantonments of the U.S. armed forces as scenes for his weekly Sunday broadcasts , put them back in the studio for the duration . Although willing to do special camp shows , fretful Jack Benny , after several attempts , had concluded that he could n't entertain soldiers and the home folks from the same script . His advertising agency agreed , but its announcement of the disassociation raised a few eyebrows . No slacker , Jack Benny this week is right back on the Army air . <P> Benny 's plight has not been shared by those of his rivals who depend on punch rather than finesse-particularly ex-Hoofer Bob Hope , who has been going great guns before soldier audiences . Last week Hope put on his tenth straight broadcast from a training camp ( location censored ) . Benny has found that incalculable whoops and whistles upset his expertly worried lines . No ad-libber , he has to stick to his painfully prepared script , feels that a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin against his radio listeners . <P> Uninhibited Bob Hope adores his soldier audience . Monologist and avid ad-libber , he can and does depart from his prepared script at the drop of a hat . His camp followers drop their hats so willingly that they have to be cautioned beforehand to hold down the uproar . It could spoil the timing of jokes like this , which warm a soldier 's heart : <P> Girl : I meant to ask you , Bob . . . are there any sharks around San Diego ? <P> Hope : Did you ever meet a Marine with a pair of dice ? <P> The military circuit is hard work , but scoop-nosed Comedian Hope thrives on it . One week he took the Military Police apart ( a sure-fire routine for soldiers ) ; next week , when he arrived at Camp Haan , the M.P.s threw him in the guardhouse . At Camp Roberts a distraught recruit whose girl in the Midwest had just returned his engagement ring asked Hope to say a word to her in his broadcast . Hope explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show he looked up the jilted soldier and put in a telephone call for him . With half the camp hanging around , Hope kidded the girl until she was so delirious she not only made up to her boy friend but apologized for sending back the ring .
