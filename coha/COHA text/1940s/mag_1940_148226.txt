The Male Animal ( by James Thurber &; Elliott Nugent ; produced by Herman Shumlin ) provides Broadway-in a season rich only in comedy-with another comedy hit . A frail , rachitic tyke of a play , with barely enough clothes to cover it , The Male Animal manages to captivate by its impish tongue and winning smile . It resembles a dinner party where there is n't nearly enough food but where the conversation is so amusing that nobody minds . <P> James Thurber , famous for illustrating The War Between the Sexes with his runaway pencil , has carried the combat to the stage . The Male Animal tells of a young English professor ( Elliott Nugent ) who has all the trouble that Thurber thinks the male animal is born to . The prof gets branded a Red for wanting to read one of Vanzetti 's letters to his class . He gets all tangled up with his wife when an old sweetheart of hers comes to town for a football game . A Milquetoast by nature , the professor quaffs too much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decides to hold his mate as bull elephants , swans , land crabs do - by fighting for her . He does hold her , but not with his fists ; it turns out that the old beau 's interest is only pigskin deep . <P> The Male Animal serves up its bit of plot successively as roast turkey , creamed turkey , turkey hash , scraps , soup , and bones for the dog . Fortunately , Play wright Thurber 's insane , melancholy slant on life fills the play with fresh and free-flowing laughter . Frustration is leavened into nonsense , indignation is alkalized by good nature . Admirably cast and directed by Producer Shumlin , The Male Animal is a gay evening in the theatre in spite of being no play at all . <P> John Henry ( by Roark Bradford ; music by Jacques Wolfe ; produced by Sam Byrd ) took Paul Robeson back to Broadway after nearly eight years . The stage seemed set for a great return . The play was by the man whose stories had inspired The Green Pastures . Robeson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the legendary strong man , the Negro Paul Bunyan , of the Black River country . <P> But though Robeson was still a superb figure of a man with a deep and thrilling voice , John Henry proved an elaborate bore . A rambling , rag-picaresque tale of a black giant toting 800-lb. bales of cotton , laying rails with his bare hands , groaning with woman trouble and at last crashing down while trying to perform a Black River Labor of Hercules , the play never achieved either dramatic excitement or heroic force . <P> John Henry performed his feats as though they were vaudeville acts . The music rose &; fell , ebbed &; flowed , without seeming to come from the hearts of the black people who sang it . Crowds moved sheeplike about the stage as though at the bidding of a traffic cop . Even Robeson could not save the situation . He could not carry on his back 800 pounds of bad play .
