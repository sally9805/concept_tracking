When 200 A.F. of L. newspaper carriers went on strike last week , 816,048 St. Louisians went without their local newspapers . Readers of the Post-Dispatch , the Globe-Democrat and the Star-Times could get their surrender news by radio , from out-of-town papers , or do without . <P> The carriers had won collective bargaining rights from WLB , but the publishers refused to bargain with them , on the grounds that the carriers were independent merchants . Publishers told other employees that they were temporarily discharged for the duration of the strike , and entitled to no pay for standing by . It looked as if St. Louis publishers , alarmed by recent newspaper strikes in New York , Fort Wayne and Birmingham , had decided to get tough-with all the unionists in their employ . <P> The Newspaper Guild promptly cried " lockout , " voted to go on strike themselves , stay out till they got their back pay .
