Last Man Off Wake Island By LT . COL . WALTER L. J. BAYLER , USMC As Told to CECIL CARNES O NCE more there were twenty-seven Jim planes  --  enough to wipe the island off the map  --  but they came over at an altitude of 20,000 feet or thereabouts , and released their bombs from just this side of the stars . Some missed the atoll group entirely ; a few fell in the lagoon ; not one did any damage to our property or personnel . Happily , two of us had n't forgotten the daily raid . Jimmy Devereux had his antiaircraft-gun crews standing by their guns , and Paul Putnam saw to it that his precious Grumman were somewhere aloft . They were higher even than the Japs  --  so high the pilots were obliged to use their oxygen . As usual , the raid was a quick sweep over and back , lasting no more than a few of those minutes which always seemed so long . 1 came out from my coral-boulder retreat , shook the sand from my shorts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw one of our planes , dangerously low , sweeping in from the sea . It was in trouble  --  losing altitude fast , and its engine had stopped . I held my breath , expecting it to plunge into the sea , but at the last critical second the pilot somehow lifted her the few extra feet which enabled him to make a dead-stick landing on the beach , just above the creaming surf . There was a flurry of spray and send . When it subsided , I saw that the Grumman had crumpled up like an accordion . I was already running toward the spot , dreading what I would find in the wreckage . While still fifty yards away , I saw a figure rise from the ruins , jump to the ground and turn to look dejectedly at the crashed plane . I recognized big Hank Elrod . He had a small cut on his right cheek , which earned him the distinction of being our only casualty for the day . He stood a moment , silently looking at his plane , then reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That done , he turned and walked with me through the woods . When we reached the airport , we were assaulted by a gibbering maniac , hysterical with delight . He centered his attack on me , babbling inarticulately as he tried to tell me his news , " I got ' em , Walt ! I got ' em ! I told you I would ! Two of the dirty murderers ! Just like I said  --  one for Holden and one for Straw-berry ! " Davirlsop. ? had kept the promise he made his two dead friends . He had come down on the tail of the Jap formation and sent the two rearmost planes plunging into the sea in flames . One more bomber had been picked out of the sky by our antiaircraft batteries , which had been whanging away from their nests in the woods .  --  .. With the departure of the Tojo Express , we considered ourselves safe for the rest of the day , and took stock of the losses sustained by each side since dawn . The enemy had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " probably " a big supply ship or transport . last seen departing in flames , and three bombers . Their loss of life was unknown . but was certainly considerable . We had lost one small fighter plane . About the middle of the afternoon we picked an item out of the air that tickled us greatly . When they had the time , my radio boys liked to listen in to a San Francisco station which kept us informed of current events . And of late , for the sake of variety , they had been tuning in on a Japanese station where an English-speaking woman held forth . Her opening line in a lilting , singsong voice was , " Now Radio Tokyo is here with the news . " An hour or so after the raiders had bombed the barracuda in the lagoon , we were electrified to hear from this sanguine lady that Japanese troops had effected a landing on Wake and captured the island . That was news to us , all right . We did n't laugh , however , when some doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alamo of the Pacific . We wished he hod ' t been AO previous with his crown of martyrdom . e afternoon as I was passing Magazine No. 10 ? the magazine which had been converted to hospital use after the naval hospital had been bombed out of commission  --  I saw an odd-looking figure standing near the entrance . He was a civilian with a long black beard and piercing black eyes . He was barrel-chested , hatless and barefooted . He was wearing a pair of cheap cotton trunks , which were clean but threadbare , and he had on nothing else but a coat of deep rich tan . Tucked securely under one skinny arm was a big copy of the Holy Bible . The first chance I had , I asked Dan Teeters what he knew of him . The bearded one had been and still was a good workman , Dan told me , but the first air raid on December eighth had done something to him spiritually . He produced the big Bible and announced himself prepared to serve as chaplain on Wake Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any religious ceremony , visit the sick and comfort the afflicted . " And the funny thing is , " said Dan reflectively , " the men tell me he has a genius for turning up in places just when he 's really needed . " The night of December eleventh ' witnessed a deeply moving scene . In a long trench which had been quietly prepared beside the curving road , the bodies of our eighty anldiers and civilians who had-rtiVd-in the raids up to this time vereco.i.e to rest. - Each body was neatly wrapped in a.ei ; ir'f.v ii- ? hret and every detail of the burial was performed with tenderness and decorum . But there were no lights , no rifle squad to fire volleys in the air . The merest handful of mourners were present . Spiv Cunningham , who was in charge of naval activities on the island , was there , and Devereux and Teeters . Hardly anybody on the island knew about this funeral until it was over , In any war area , especially one like ours , open to surprise attacks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided the concentration of persons at any single spot . There was one man , however , who somehow heard of the funeral . As the last sheeted form was lowered to its place , a ghostlike figure came out of the night to stand at the head of the grave . Nobody questioned his right to be there , and all heads were reverently bowed as the self-appointed chaplain of Wake Island paid tribute to our dead and promised them life everlasting . It ve been about the time the funeral was being held that I wandered over to the concrete bombproof where Captain Wilson had housed his radio apparatus . Wilson was there alone , and I sat down for a at . reux eve- , had sent a full report of our victory Jimmy over D the enemy my Harsea banor. and air The forces report to the e commander ined chi . e withf appropriateat Pear congratulations . and then headquarters thoughtfully inquired if there was anything Major evereux wanted . Wilson 's eyes twinkled.re " Whded. at do you think Jimmy answered ' ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know . e radioed ; ' Send us more Jape ! ' " At the usual time the next day , the Tojo Express came roaring back out of the southern sky . Our three remaining Grummans were topside , watching for the raiders , and our antiaircraft batteries polka dotted the blue heavens with white puffballs from their exploding shells . There were thirty bombers that day  --  the most we bad yet entertained at one time . They failed badly . The big visitors kept high , scoring no hits at all . When their bomb bays were empty , they wheeled and headed for home , pursued by the Grumman . Assuming that the bombers came from at least six or seven hundred miles away , it was a source of wonder to us how they managed , day after day , to reach our pin point in the Pacific with such unvarying accuracy . They never overshot the mark to be forced to come back to us from the north ; they never came in et an does bolster my theory that a submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall Islands right to our very doorstep . Kliewer 's feat threw them off their stride for only forty hours . They varied the monotony of the midday raids early on the morning of the fourteenth , when a lone flier appeared over Wake at 4:20 a.m. and unloaded a cargo of bombs . He slid away into the darkness as fast as he had come out of it , having done no damage . But the lone dawn raider on the fourteenth was only a foretaste of what that unholy Sabbath had in store for UN . At noon , thirty-two bombers came over . They kept high , which helped , but still they managed to give the airport an awful pasting . Shrapnel buzzed around Magazine No. 10 , now housing the hospital , at such a lively rate that it was decided to move all cots and patients to the lower level . The lower level was where the operating tables were , so , when the change was made , the patients had a fine chance to learn something about surgery and to see and admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Kahn , USNR . I went to the hospital whenever I could get the chance , to visit Spider Webb and others , and so had an opportunity to meet and marvel at Kahn . Clad in a suit of hospital pajamas , heavily bearded from lack of time to shave , hollow-eyed from lack of sleep and rest , sallow from confinement underground and lack of proper nourishment , he worked on doggedly , performing wonders on the rough board tables which served for operations , end he performed them with utterly inadequate equipment . The better stuff had been destroyed in the raid on the ninth which bleated the naval hospital . Destroying the Records I was interested in the routine precautions taken in the hospital when air-raid alerts were sounded . First the doors were shut and secured . Then Kahn end the corpsmen went hurriedly from cot to cot , placing tongue depressors in the patients ' mouths and telling them to bite down , I inquired about the tongue depressors and was told they were to prevent shattered eardrums , in case a bomb scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fourteenth that I considered it only prudent to take a certain precaution of my own . I called up the commanding officer of the naval air station to ask him what he was doing about his secret and confidential publications . He told me he had received instruction to burn all such papers not in effect  --  that is , all the " reaerve-onbeard " publications . That was 011 I needed . I was able to oblige six civilians who asked for something useful to do . Between us we tore all hooks and publications into bits , threw the tattered remains into a fifty-five-gallon gasoline drum that had been badly strafed , poured about five gallons of gasoline over the stuff and touched it off . When I destroyed those secret documents I regarded it as leaning over backward in the interests of caution . It never occurred to me , any more than it did to anybody else on the island , that our squadron safe would ever be actually looted by the . Taps . Wake was an outpost of a mighty nation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sent the reinforcements needed to hold the fort . I had spent six nights in my rat-infested foxhole when I rebelled and moved for one night into a cozy concrete bomb shelter and slept like a log , with nothing running over me or trying to make nests in my hair . The place was even rain and tide proof , so I woke up bone-dry for a change . Then Paul Putnam , who was bunking in the command post , invited me to move in with him . He did n't have to ask me twice . It was equivalent to swapping a hall bedroom in a bug-ridden rooming house for a bridal suite in a de luxe hotel . We had lights , telephones , NI radio  --  everything but breakfast in bed . I would wake about 4:45 , while it was still dark . Paul would be moving around , too , and we 'd grope for our shoes in the pitch blackness . I would climb up on the revetment and make my toilet by combing my hair with my fingers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it carefully with a handkerchief . The pest commanded a view of neighbor- ing dugouts , whose tousle-headed inhabitants would presently start creeping to the surface , like a colony of ground hogs corning up for air . A little pickup truck would clatter into the ground-hog village , take aboard a pair of pilots and push off again in a cloud of white thud . It would run them to the airplane revetment at the west end of the runway , where they would climb aboard the planes . Soon the coughing of cold engines would come to my cars . The Rheumatic Grumman Usually , in a few minutes the phone would ring . I would take the customary message from the hangar : " Sir , Number Sixteen wo n't ' take ' this morning . " I would relay the news to Paul , who would order the other plane  --  by then our only good one  --  to go up alone . No. 16 was our problem plane . Its theme song was , " Oh , how I hats to get up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun had warmed it , it would almost go up of its own accord . My theory was that it had rheumatism and needed only a brisk rubdown with any good liniment , but that was too simple fur our expert mechanist , who went on installing other engines , new carburetors , new batteries and magnetos , from the planes previously cracked up . And No. 16 would just put back its ears and balk . Life really began with breakfast . I would stroll to our open-sir cafeteria and sit on a rock , talking with the boys , while our volunteer pot-walloper heated up the remainder of last night 's coffee , or " boiler compound , " as we called it . When Dan Teeters ' chuck wagon nu-rived there would be a liberal helping of stew from steaming kettles , fresh coffee , fresh bread , jam , and sometimes milk made from milk powder . Back then , by way of the other side of the field , to our own command post . Now it would be time to atop , look and listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. sun helmet , because the wind would whistle through it , and that , combined with the roar of the surf , made it next to impossible to hear anything . Marines were doing the same in every direction  --  standing with their hats in their handa . It made them look as if they were gathered together reverently in prayer . Finally , there would come the expected ringing of the telephone on the battle circuit . It would be the observer at Roki Point or Peacock Point , " Sound of airplane motors , sir , " and the direction from which the sound was corning . All eyes would turn to the indicated quarter . At last I 'd see them , specks of light flashing in the sun . I would radio the news to the Grumman , high in the heavens . " Bandits . . south of field . . . about four miles off . .. flying high . " I 'd draw my pistol and send three shots into the air , and hear the signal repeated far and near . Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three artists , but were merely terrified amateurs . At eleven o'clock the same morning the Tojo Express arrived , twenty-seven strong . That was a pretty tough raid . It left us with several men wounded , but our antiaircraft boys shot down two big bombers . The Busy Sixteenth There were forty-one planes in the raid which came over on the sixteenth at twelve-thirty . We watched them arriving from the command-post entrance , and saw the flight divide just before it reached the island . One section concentrated on us at the airport ; the other crowd swerved away and poured it on civilian Camp 2 . There were no casualties to personnel in either area , but one hit blew up a dynamite dump on Wilkes Island . The explosion was a super-duper . That evening just as twilight was deepening into dusk , we received a lone raider who was flying a big four-engined seaplane . He was nervy , for after he had dropped his bombs he came lower in the teeth of a withering fire from antiaircraft guns and strafed the airport with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D. C. , was up there somewhere in Problem Plane No. 16 , carrying out the usual twilight patrol . The moment the lone Jap raider appeared , I called Duke by radio and told him what was going on . I peered cautiously out of the command-post entrance to see what would happen . I could n't see the Jap , but I know where he was , since he was firing tracer bullets that Linked him to the earth by smoky ribbons . But there was no sign or sound of Duke Tharin , and our antiaircraft fire was still failing to connect . The Jap 's guns were suddenly silent and the luminous ribbons faded out , Then Tharin struck . His bullets , fired at close range , ripped the seaplane from one end to the other . At last the Jap 's starboard engines caught fire and he headed downward to make a forced landing on the sea . Tharin 's excited voice sounded , " He 's down . Walt ! I 'm coming in for bombs , and then finish him off ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while the armorers were hoisting two bombs into place , he told me what he had dune . He had figured we on the ground were holed up as usual , and hardly likely to be struck , so he had hovered around at a distance , keeping clear of our antiaircraft stuff till the lap had emptied his guns . Then Tharin had sailed in and torn him to pieces . He flew off with his bombs to the spot where he had left the burning plane , but the coup ate grace turned out to be unnecessary . He got there just in time to see the charred wreckage sink . The crowded sixteenth bad still another event up its sleeve . We were routed out of bed that night by a sudden alert . One of the lookouts had spotted a concentration of ships approaching Wake . and it was " battle stations " for all hands in a hurry . Here was something we had been more than half expecting  --  an attempt at a night landing by the Jape . There was a ' crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight as a ground force in repelling the invaders . We turned out eagerly , every man overhauling his weapons to make sure that pistol and tummy gun and ride and knife and bayonet were ready for their jobs . We stood by in the dark , waiting till we knew where the Jap-laden surfboats would drive in . We were immensely cheered by the prospect of battling a flesh-and-blood foe , men you could actually see and hear  --  and maybe kill before they killed you . We were sick to death of dodging bombs dropped from a height of three or four miles , against which we could do nothing . Aviation was ready for action , and it looked as if we were going to get it pronto . We got a pain in the neck instead . The flotilla faded out into the night and was never seen or heard from again . We never knew what ships they were or whose . They might have been a Jap task force passing Wake en route to some other objective . They could have even been ships of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumber , the Japs picked that night for a raid . I do n't know how many planes were involved , but there were plenty . And we had to wait anxiously for daylight before we could ascertain definitely that no serious damage had been done . We were inc:ined to believe the attack was aimed at our morale rather than at more material targets . Transfer to Midway The next day , the seventeenth , the Tojo Express was with us as usual . Bombs hit the Diesel-oil depot on the other side of the island and set it afire . It burned the rest of the afternoon , sending up a towering column of heavy black smoke that mushroomed at the top and hung over Wake like a pall . On the eighteenth there were no bombers at all . Besides the absence of bombs , the eighteenth Lives in my memory for another very pleasant reason . Very early that morning a civilian , fishing for something interesting on his radio , picked up a news item that swept over the island like a tidal wave . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were safe . On the morning of the nineteenth the raid turned up at ten-thirty , nearly two hours in advance of the usual time . Camp 1 and our airport were the targets selected . When we woke next morning , the twentieth , and my routine tour was over . I sat down , took out my notebook and wrote a few lines in the diary I keep for my wife  --  the same one in which I had described Wake Island as being so utterly peaceful . It was eleven o'clock and the weather was getting more and more unusual . I wrote : " Today , lots of rain in the sky so far . " Then , with bombers in mind , I added : " 1 hope nothing else comes out of the sky today . " However , something did . Out of the gray mist came a big Navy patrol boat piloted by Ensign Murphy , USN , to drop on the surface of the lagoon as Lightly as a gull . He brought official mail for Devereux and Cunningham . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor , touching at Midway en route . Midway ? Paul Putnam pricked up his ears when he heard that . He remembered me and my orders . " We 've an officer here who is needed at Midway and is under orders to proceed there as soon as possible . Have you room to take him ? " " Sure , " said Murphy , " plenty of room , and glad to have him . " I had to hustle to get ready . Not that I had much packing to do , but there were other matters to be cleaned up . I went to Spiv Cunningham 's office for my orders , but they had been destroyed when his headquarters was bombed Spiv remembered what they were , how-ever , so he directed me verbally to pro-ceed to Midway by this , the " fret avail-able air transport . " That settled , I hur-ried hack to the airport . Much as I would have liked to , it was physically impossible for me to play postman for all marines and civilians , but I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wounded . I told them the messages must he exceedingly brief , // and promised to get them off by telegraph at the earliest moment . I still have the page in my notebook on which I wrote them down . To Mrs. J. R. Lanning , 320 D Street , National City , California : " O.K. , Chick . " To Mrs. Neil Gooding , of Gooding , Idaho : " O.K. from Boyce . " To H. 0 . Pace , Casa Grande , Arizona : " O.K. from John . " To V. F. Webb , 110 Military Street , Oxford . North Carolina : " O.K. ; everything fine , from Garham . " To Mrs. Luther Williams , of Stonewall , Mississippi : " Solon is O.K. Tough fight , but O.K. " To Mrs. C. E. Compton , 2419 Fern-leaf , Los Angeles . California : " Just say Clair is O.K. " To F. W. Reeves , 334 Hawthorne Avenue , Palo Alto , California : " O.K. from Wayne . " Murphy was taking off at five in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before hitting the deck again . Paul gave ale his report to date to take out . The pickup truck ran roe to Devereux 's command post . Jimmy was not yet there , but Maj. George Potter , of Annapolis , Maryland , was waiting for me with a packet of official papers . I hastened to the lagoon dock , where Murphy was already beginning to look from the eastern sky to his wrist watch and hack again . Quite a few of the officers and men who had become my friends during the past month were there to bid me good-by . There were it few hard handclasps , a hurried " I 'll be seeing you . " Now that the moment had come , I was sorry to he leaving . The bombing raids were a nuisance , of course , but an end would be put to them  --  and very soon , I was sure  --  when reinforcements arrived . Meanwhile , there was nothing to worry about . There were ample supplies of everything a defense force could need  --  food , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers were good , and they led as fine a bunch of fighting men as ever breathed . I looked at the flag , still snapping in the breeze at the top of the pole where it had been hoisted on December eighth . / looked at the grinning faces and the confident bearing of the youngsters on the dock . As I waved good-by and took my seat in the plane , my smile was as cheerful as theirs . I knew all would go well with Wake Island . Later , after I had been on Midway , news came that seemed at first a fantastic , incredible rumor . Then it was confirmed . Wake had fallen . There remained for me to question : What had happened ? The answer was obvious . The defenders had simply been overwhelmed by superior force in every quarter  --  on land , on the sea and in the air . Only the details of the disaster were lacking . as they still are and pro5a5ly will he until the end of the war . The last two dispatches from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen-day siege . The final phase of the Battle of Wake was reached a little after five o'clock on the afternoon of December twenty-second , only thirty-six hours after I had looked back from Murphy 's seaplane and told myself that all would be well with those I 'd left behind . The first of those two dispatches rei . Ported that the enemy had made a landing , but added , with a magnificent disregard for irresistible force : " The issue is in doubt . " I could imagine Devereux or Spiv Cunningham taking up a pencil , frowning a little and wondering what to write , while Captain Wilson waited to transmit the text . Then writing those five words . On that last day the Jape sent over an enormous number of heavy planes , which subjected the whole island to an incessant , merciless bombing . The second and last dispatch revealed that at least part of Wake 's battery of 5-inch guns had come through that bombing intact . The report said that mare Jap ships and transports were moving in , and ended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I read those closing words I swallowed hard . As simply as the words of a child 's first reader , yet as eloquently as if the entire dictionary had been used , they told the story of how Wake had gone down with courage undimmed and guns flaming defiantly . However the Jape called it . I know our boys met them unafraid , willing to die , but determined to exact a high price for their lives . It is safe to assume that they got that price . Through the steady eyes of the men on Wake , our country , all of us , can see the final victory ahead .
