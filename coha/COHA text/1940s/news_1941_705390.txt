Backed by Administration leaders . the liberalizing bill will be brought up on the floor for action tomorrow . Its passage is certain . Swift action also appears likely in the Senate and the measure should be passed and on its way to the White House in less than two weeks . The new legislation will be applicable to 1940 tax returns . But , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury John I ... Sallivan , in explaining the complex . 35-page tax relief bill , emphasized that taxpayers are to file their March 15 returns regardless of the new amendments and then petition for adjustment . Highlights of Amendments Highlights of the new amendments , which were promised at the time of the passage of the original act , are : 1 . Permission for all corporations regardless of size to carry over unused excess profits credits for two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted only for corporations with earnings of not more than $25.000. 2 . A new alternative method for computing the average earnings credit to benefit " growth " coOorations which earned more in the last : , ftwo years of the 1936-39 base period than in the first two years3. provisioi for rocapitalizatfon Of advertising- and ? es-i-Nesea claimed during the , base period . ' FPEr 4 . Permission for insurance companies other than life and mutual companies to join in consolidated returns with ordinary corporations with which they may be affiliated . 5 . A general clause permitting adjustments for abnormalities made during the base period . This new general relief provision makes broad allowances for low income during the base period caused either by a change in- the type of business or by abnormal business fluctuations . Shift During Base Period A. corporation which claims low income because , for example . it shifted during the base period from a retail to a wholesale enterprise , or one which claims that normal production . output or operations was interrupted or di- minished by an " abnormal event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the new section provides the following two important limitations in an effort to keep out relief claims where there is only s small amount involved : 1 . No corporation may seek relief under the new section unless its excess profits tax is equal to at least 6 of its normal tax net income . 2 . Igo corporation may petition for adjustment unless the tax it would have to pay with the relief granted is at least 10% less than the tax would be without the benefit of the general relief section . May Be Appealed - In all cases of abnormality adjustments , the new bill specifies , decisions of the Internal Revenue Commission may tie carried to the board of tax appeals , beyond which there is no review . Under existing law . in figuring excess profits credit under the average earnings method . a corporation adds up its earnings during the base period . treating any one deficit year as zero , and divides by four . The new formula providing special treatment for " growth corporations " is as follows : A corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base period and then the average of the second two years . The average of the first two years is subtracted from the average of the second . The result is divided by two , and this is then added to the average of the second two years . The formula may be used by any corporation when its income in the latter half of the base period is greater than that in the first half , but the total amount of the credit may not exceed the best year of the base period . How Base May Be Lifted An example : A corporation earns $100,000 in 1936 , 5200,000 in 1937. $300,000 in 1938 and $400,000 in 1939 . The average of the first two years is $150,000 , the average of the second two . ** Subtracting $150.000 from $350 , - 000 gives $200,000. which is reduced by one halt and the resulting $100.000 is added to the $350. - 000 average of the second half of the base , giving a credit of $450,000 . But since the credit may not exceed tin best year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $400,000 for its credit . Figured under the regular formula , its credit would have been only $250,000 . In connection with the provision for recapitalization of advertising and good will expenses , Congressional and Treasury - tax Experts explained that many corporations have made a practice of deducting the full amount of such expenses , even though some of the amount should have been considered as additions to capital . The alloivance to make up for that is given here , provided adjustments , with penalties and : interest , are made for normal taxes during the base period years . The new amendment also permits adjustments in regard to tax years closed by the statute of limitations . The year 1936 is now so closed , and the year 1937 will be March 15 . The law provides that the correct anuiunt of income be used in computing average earnings . Where the correct amount turns out to be higher than the amount reported in past tax returns , the amendment provides that a corporation may claim the higher income , providing taxes are paid on the additional amount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated that the two-year carryover provision will cost the Treasury $44. - 000,000 on 1940 incomes , but that about $7 , - 000,000 will be recaptured in individual income taxes resulting from increased dividends . This makes a net loss on 1940 incomes from this provision of $37,000,000 , but Mr. Sullivan said it probably will be boosted to about $65,000,000 in the first full year of operation . Thetowth formula will cost the Treasury about $ .000,000 on 1940 incomes , he estimated , and ? thereafter about - $36,000,000 annually . This gives a total loss . from the carry- over and growth formula provisions of $101 , - 000,000 a year . Mr. Sullivan said that the original estimate of more than $325,000,000 as the amount of revenue to be taken in by the excess profits tax this year still stands ' and that for the following year it should be $800,000,000 or more .
