The news of China had a somber , almost majestic sameness . Again the dispatches told of Jap advances , Chinese retreat , threatened disaster ( see WORLD BATTLE-FRONTS ) . Again Chinese spokesmen pleaded for aid . Again the U.S. Government replied with a tribute . Vice President Wallace , leaving Chungking , left behind a message from President Roosevelt to Chiang Kaishek : " The stand which your people have made against the forces of aggression has set an example for all the friends of China . , . . " <P> Thus was ending the seventh year of China 's war . It had not been a hopeless year . At its end , the Chinese no longer felt that they had been fobbed off with nothing but promises . U.S. and British forces on the Burma fringe , U.S. airmen in China had done what they could for China ( and for the Allied cause ) . Millions of U.S. dollars had been poured into China to provision the Fourteenth Air Force , bolster China 's strained finance . But Erh Ch'i-July 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month-would not be a happy day for the Chinese . It had not been a happy day since 1937 , when the Japanese chose the Double Seventh to seize the Marco Polo Bridge near Peiping , begin the long " incident . " <P> State of a Nation . As Year VIII began , the burden on China 's broad and patient back had never seemed so grievous , her strength to bear it never so taxed . <P> China choked within the Jap blockade . Her lack of supplies , particularly heavy weapons for an army of riflemen and grenade-throwers , had become so vast that a new Burma Road could not satisfy it . Perhaps nothing less than an Allied landing on the China coast and the winning of a major supply port would do . Now the Japs , astride the Hankow-Canton line , threatened to cut this desperate hope . Certainly , until the blockade was thoroughly broken , no one could expect the ill-fed , ill-munitioned Chinese armies to take the offensive . <P> China suffered from a creeping paralysis . The Jap invader had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreplenished fleet of motor trucks , 15,000 strong two years ago , had worn down to a wheezy 5,000 machines , and many of these were idle for lack of spare parts . More than ever , China traveled and hauled by foot , mule and human carrier . More than ever , the lack of mobility hobbled her armies , sharpened the peril of famine , loosened the bonds of central government . <P> China was sick with inflation . Somehow a nation whose masses had always lived close to bare subsistence could endure the shortage of goods , the 360% rise in the cost of living . It could wear threadbare cotton garments more threadbare ; it could do with a daily bowlful less of rice . But the enduring masses could not correct the evils that trailed inflation-profiteering , black markets , " squeeze , " public cynicism , official corruption .
