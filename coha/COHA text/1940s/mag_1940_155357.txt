One day last August , moody Willard Hershberger , second-string catcher for the Cincinnati Reds , slit his throat with a razor . Few weeks later , pounding down the homestretch in the National League pennant race , first-string Catcher Ernie Lombardi sprained his ankle . On the eve of the World Series , Manager Bill McKechnie was on a spot . Lombardi 's understudy was too green to be put behind the slugging Detroit Tigers at the plate . <P> " I 'll get back into harness , " volunteered Jimmy Wilson , the Reds ' piano-legged , 40-year-old coach . Coach Wilson , father of a 117-year-old son , had been a great backstop in his day ( once made 18 putouts in one game ) , had caught for the St. Louis Cardinals in three World Series , had caught for as well as managed the Philadelphia Phillies for five years ( and transformed Third Baseman Bucky Walters into one of baseball 's best pitchers ) before fading to the sidelines two years ago . As Cincinnati 's coach , Jimmy Wilson had done nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise his lungs in first-base pep talks . <P> Back into harness went Wilson . And , when the last Tiger had been put out for Cincinnati 's first world championship in 21 years , baseball 's historians , many of them fat &; 40 too , hailed Jimmy Wilson 's performance one of the most astounding of all time . On rusty haunches he had caught six of the Series ' seven games , handled his pitchers perfectly ( especially his old protege , Bucky Walters ) , batted a better than average .353 , and , despite a charley horse , chalked up the only stolen base of the Series . <P> Last fortnight , while Cincinnati 's President Powel Crosley rejoiced over a $12 dividend for Red stockholders , President Philip K. Wrigley of the Chicago Cubs whined over his teddy bears . After spending a small fortune for players in the past three years , the gummed-up Cubs had finished in the second division . " Perhaps I ought to fire myself , " he pondered publicly . But , on second thought-a few days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the Cubs ' recent castoffs-President Wrigley fired Manager Gabby Hartnett . <P> Once before , when he had been displeased with his Cubs , Andover-bred Owner Wrigley hired a psychoanalyst to discover what was wrong with them . This time he hired a sportswriter , Jimmy Gallagher of the Chicago Herald-American . Jimmy Gallagher 's first move as general manager : he got Oldtimer Jimmy Wilson , at a reputed $20,000 a year , to manage the Chicago Cubs .
