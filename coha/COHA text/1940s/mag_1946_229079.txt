Unless war can be abolished , the U.S. officially informed the U.N . last week , the only recourse of peace-loving nations against aggressors using atomic bombs will be to develop bigger &; better atomic bombs . The announcement was made in Scientific Information , Volume I of Bernard M. Baruch 's report to the U.N . Atomic Energy Commission . <P> The report outlined the uselessness of all direct and indirect defenses against atom bombs , but added a comforting note : " War with this weapon will not be completely unendurable in a country adequately prepared and strong enough to withstand the first onslaught . The length of the war would certainly be increased by adequate dispersion of great industrial areas and the construction of subterranean factories . . . . We can expect war to continue until . . . the will to resist is finally broken . "
