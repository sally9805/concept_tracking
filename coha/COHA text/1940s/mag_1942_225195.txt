A broad-shouldered man with a photogenic grin stepped from a Navy bomber . Troops in red tunics and white helmets presented arms . A band played The Star-Spangled Banner . Four years ago the same man had visited Brazil as a private citizen . Now Colonel Frank Knox , U.S. Secretary of the Navy , came as a comrade in arms . He lunched with President Getulio Vargas , banqueted with Brazil 's top fighting men , visited war plants and strategic airfields . <P> Primarily the Knox junket ( aside from giving a restless man a break from Washington routine ) was to inspect defenses against submarine attacks which have spread from Iceland to the mouth of the Rio de la Plata . Said Knox : <P> " I bring the salute of the armed forces of the U.S. to Brazilian comrades at the moment when your danger is our danger ; and as we share in the toil of war , we shall share in the victory . " <P> This was shoulder-to-shoulder fight talk that made good listening to Brazilians . One high Brazilian army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German attack ? We entered the war to fight . Let us fight .
