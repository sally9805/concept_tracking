Ruddy and jolly as his bright necktie , Roger Lapham , ex-mayor of San Francisco and boss of ECA 's China operation , flew into Washington to report to ECAdministrator Paul Hoffman . The essence of his report was that EGA in China was doing all right . That is , economic aid was being delivered in fair amounts ( 299,065 bales of cotton by the end of September , 17,800 long tons of flour and 94,000 long tons of rice by early October ) . Lapham seemed to feel also that the whole job was being carried out in a businesslike , American fashion . <P> But he did not think that the $275 million which Congress had appropriated for the purpose , to last until April 2 , was going to be enough . Lapham thought it was unrealistic to suppose that the U.S. could pull China out of her economic hole with a one-year program . Unless Congress was prepared to hand out many more millions , under firm U.S. controls , China 's economic future was dim . <P> No Hurry . But China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which everything , including her economy , depended . That was worse than dim ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Communist forces had overrun just about all of northeast China , were extending a throttling grip on the whole nation . <P> Six months ago the U.S. had declared its intention of giving Chiang Kai-shek military aid . Congress , forcing a reluctant State Department to include China in the EGA program , , authorized $275 million in economic aid and added $125 million for military supplies . <P> But so far only a little more than $2,000,000 in military supplies has trickled into Chiang Kai-shek 's military depots . From May to October , Chinese procurement agents trotted fruitlessly around Washington . There was haggling over prices . Chiang Kai-shek sent a personal appeal to President Truman to hurry things up . But not until last week did the Chinese finally get some definite answers . Forty percent of the top priority items on their shopping lists , they were told , would be shipped from West Coast ports in early December ; 60% would be ready to ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delay ? The fundamental reason was the fact that the U.S. has been in psychological retreat from China ever since the end of the war . Secretary of State George Marshall had never reconciled himself to doing business with a Chinese government which he considered corrupt . Furthermore , his policy was to give Europe top priority which had been U.S. policy during the war . Right or wrong , he considered the Far East situation secondary . <P> Was he right or wrong ? The question might soon be settled by history . The military news indicated that he might have been tragically wrong , for reasons which he himself had foreseen eight months ago . In February 1948 , Marshall had appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee , had there engaged in a blunt exchange with Minnesota 's Congressman Walter Judd . <P> Marshall : If the present Chiang Kaishek government falls , the Communists will take power north of the Yangtze River . <P> Judd : And if the Communists take power in the area north of the Yangtze . . . what would be our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be untenable . <P> Judd : And with the Asiatic continent under control of Soviet Russia , what would be the position of Japan ?
