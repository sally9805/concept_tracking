txt John F. Maragon , personal friend of Maj. Gen. Harry H. Vaughan , President Truman 's military aide , claimed constitutional rights and refused to answer some questions at the " five percenter " inquiry today on the ground that his answers " might tend to incriminate " him . Just before Mr. Maragon took the witness stand , Carmine S. Bellion , a staff investigator for the Senate investigations subcommittee , testified that while Mr. Maragon had filed income tax forms indicating an income of about $30,000 in the last five years , he had bank deposits of almost $120 , - 000 in that period . Prior to Mr. Bellino 's testimony , the subcommittee received a memorandum from Henry F. Grady , Ambassador to Greece and former head of the United States group . in the Allied mission to observe the Greek elections in 1946 . Mr. Maragon was an administrative assistant assigned to the mission . Mr. Grady said that he was a " nuisance " and got into trouble when he started investigating the Army 's Air Transport Command overseas without authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry to determine whether Washington " five percenters " or " influence peddlers " are a determining factor in the letting of C-overrunent contracts . Headed by Senator Clyde R. Hoey , Democrat , of North Carolina , the subcommittee is a part of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments . When Mr. Maragon walked to the witness stand this morning he was smiling and jovial . He greeted several newspaper reporters , calling them by their first names . Wearing a gray suit , he faced the subcommittee in a hearing room jammed with reporters , photographers and spectators . He smoked incessantly as he testified . His occupation , he said , was a publisher 's representative . The first question that Senator Hoey asked Mr. Maragon was whether he had ever accepted any money , or a fee of any kind , for services rendered to anyone seeking a Government contract , or whether he had ever represented a client in negotiations with the Government . " On advice of my attorney , I stand on my constitutional rights and refuse to answer that question on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Maragon replied . Senator Hoey followed this with a series of questions related to certain phases of the hearings , but Mr. Maragon refused to answer . His attorney , Myron G. Ehrlich , coached his client constantly throughout the session . Leaning on the arm of Mr. Maragon 's chair , the lawyer had to correct him several times in the phrasing . of his refusal to answer . Senator Karl E. Mundt , Republican , of South Dakota , and a subcommittee member , interrupted to inform the witness that his silence was " much more incriminating than anything you could say . " Mr. Maragon replied that he was merely following the advice of his attorney . Acknowledges Knowing Vaughan The Senator said that he thought he had a question Mr. Maragon could answer . " Do you know General Harry Vaughan ? " the Senator asked . " Yes , " Mr. Maragon replied . " Were you ever associated with General Vaughan ? " the Senator inquired . The witness refused to answer . Apparently annoyed , Senator Mundt said that Mr. Maragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General have been engaged in some activities that have been incriminating . " The Witness consulted his lawyer in low tones and said that he made " no implication , " and that he still refused to answer . " Your counsel ca n't brush off // MARAGON REFUSES TO TESTIFY ON FEES // the implications which are there , " the senator shouted . " I do n't care what implications are there , " the witness said . Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican , of Wisconsin , and a subcommittee member , asked if Mr. Maragon had ever discussed the " Greek situation with General Vaughan " when the Truman program for Greece was being formed . " I do n't recall , " the witness answered , " I might have . " " Have you ever boasted that you and an alleged Reverend Daniels were responsible for the Truman program for Greece ? " Senator McCarthy inquired . The witness said that he knew " Father Daniels " but that he had never discussed the Greek situation with him . Annoyed by Next Question The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maragon had with General Vaughan about the Greek situation prior to formulation- of the Truman program of aid for that country . For the first time , Mr. Maragon indicated that he was annoyed . He refused to answer the question . " Oh John , that 's not going to incriminate you , but I wo n't waste the time of the committee and , further , " Senator McCarthy retorted . However , Mr. Maragon had the last word on the matter . " I want to tell you once and for all that I had nothing to do witit the formulation of any policy for Greece or Bolivia or any other country , " he stated . Most of the information read into the record before Mr. Maragon. took the stand was r It favorable to the former Government employe and holder of a White House pass . Previously , the subcommittee disclosed that in certain instances involving Government negotiations with private companies , Mr. Maragon apparently acted as liaison between General Vaughan and the parties concerned . At one time Mr. Maragon was employed by the Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . disclosed that David A. Bennett , president of the company , paid for seven home freezers sent to General Vaughan and certain friends of the White House aide . It has been testified that General Vaughan helped Mr. Maragon get into restricted zones of Europe in 1945 on a business trip for the Verley company . ' The general was said to have notified the State Department that President Truman had a " personal interest " in the trip . Bank Accounts Investigated Testimony that Mr. Maragon gave to the subcommitte in a private session July 28 was made public at today 's session . It disclosed that he told the subcommittee that he had bank accounts in the Union Trust Company and the Liberty National Bank , both of Washington , in the period 1943 through 1947 . William P. Rogers asked him at the private session : " Did you have any accounts at any time exes.pt Union Trust and Liberty National ? " " No , " Mr. Maragon replied . When Mr. Bellino testified this morning he said the subcommittee 's investigators found another account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio , Texas . The investigator said that in 1945 , when Mr. Maragon contended he had only the Washington bank accounts , he deposited $26,303.89 in the Texas bank . Mr. Maragon , when confronted with bank statements covering this account , said that he had " forgotten about it , " according to Mr. Bellino . The investigator said that ' a total of $119,608.61 was deposited in the three accounts by Mr. Maragon during the five year period . Mr. Rogers told the subcommittee that the investigators knew of several other financial transactions that did not go through Mr. Maragon 's bank accounts . It was then explained by Mr. Bellino that when Mr. Maragon was attached to the American mission to Greece he received $5,600 a year and $15 a day for expenses . At the same time , however , he was employed by the Verley Company , which was paying him $1,000 a month . and expenses . Says He Got $9,500 in Quarter In one three-month period , January through March in 1946 , Mr. Bellino said that Mr. Maragon collected $9,500 from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Maragon in his income tax returns , the investigator said . It was during this same threemonth period that Mr. Maragon was working with the American mission . Although his fare to Europe was paid by the Government , Mr. Bellino said that Mr. Maragon charged the Verley company $565 for transportation . The last item on the expense account was for $300 covering three tickets for the Democratic party 's Jackson Day Dinner at the Mayflower Hotel here in 1946 . Mr. Bellino said Mr. Maragon had told him that all his income was reported on his tax returns and that he made an average of $6,000 or $7,000 a year during the five-year period . While Mr. Maragon was on the stand , Senator Mundt explained to him that an income tax fraud case might be brought against him . The Senator also declared that " this is a clear-cut case of perjury unless Mr. Maragon can clear things up : ' ' ' Senator McCarthy already has demanded that Mr. Maragon be indicted for perjury . Mr. Rogers disclosed that a great deal of the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internal Revenue Bureau . Discussing Mr. Maragon 's position with the American mission to Greece , Mr. Grady , who headed it , told the subcommittee in the memorandum he submitted that " even if I had not received instructions to send him back to Washington I would have done so in any case because he was making himself a nuisance . " " I learned , " Mr. Grady said , " that he was showing a picture of himself with President Truman and stating , or at least implying , that he was sent by the President to report to him directly on the activities of the mission . " He got into difficulties with the ATC because he began ' investigating ' them and implied that he was doing this on authority from Washington . There were a number of other activities of this nature that made him a source of embarrassment to me and the mission . " His statement that he had reported to me cases of excessive drinking and association with Communists on the part of members of the mission is absolutely untrue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , his attorney , Mr. Ehrlich , made public a four-page statement saying he had advised Mr. Maragon to refuse to answer certain questions . He stressed that some subcommittee members had said his client might face possible criminal proceedings and he claimed the protection of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which states that no person shall be compelled in any criminal action to be a witness against himself . The attorney asked that his statement be inserted in the record , but Senator Hoey denied the request . He said Mr. Ehrlich could give the statement to the press , or do anything he wanted with it , but he did not think it had a proper place in the record . Richard A. Martin , 26 years old , assistant to James V. Hunt , Washington management counselor , whose activities were instrumental in starting this investigation , also testified today . He said that he did not believe Mr .. Hunt ever told Paul D. Grindle , New England business man , that " all I have to sell is influence . " Mr. Grindle testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement when he accepted a check for $1,000 and assured Mr. Grindle of Government furniture contracts . Mr. Grindle said he never received a contract . Argument in Corridor When today 's session ended , Mr. Rogers and Joseph Kraus , attorney for the Verley company , had an argument in the corridor of the Senate Office Building over whether the company 's treasurer could have an affidavit inserted in the record . Mr. Kraus insisted that the document be made a part of the record , and capital police finally had to push him aside as Mr. Rogers made his way to his office . The two men conferred there later , however , and Mr. Kraus gave copies of the affidavit to reporters . It was not made a part of the record . The document said that Mr. Bennett , president of the company , knew nothing about the time in 1945 when Mr. Maragon attempted to bring valuable perfume oils into the country as champagne . Janette Schwartz , the treasurer , said further that when Mr. Bennett found out about the incident he instructed Mr. Maragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible situation ; that the Verley company had never engaged in such a situation , and deplored it ; and that Mr. Maragon take steps immediately to clear up the matter , honorably and honestly . " Mr. Maragon was fined $1,500 and the confiscated perfume oil returned to him . Mr. Kraus said that he did not know whether the company ever got the oil . Senator McCarthy has demanded that the Justice Department explain why it never prosecuted Mr. Maragon in this matter . Senator Hoey , upon adjourning today 's session , said that Mr. Hunt was physically incapable of appearing to testify . His attorney expects to file an affidavit with the subcommittee . The subcommittee hopes to end the hearings on Tuesday following testimony by General Vaughan .
