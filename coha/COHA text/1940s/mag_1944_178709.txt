Manhattan 's voice connoisseurs gathered in Carnegie Hall this week to witness an important event : the U.S. debut of a famous coloratura soprano . Curiously , the singer had not been near an opera house in almost a decade . To the U.S. public she was known chiefly as the lush blonde whose lighthearted warbling had been the feature of the lavish Hollywood musical The Great Waltz . Her name is Miliza Korjus ( pronounced Mlit'sa Kor ' - yoos ) . <P> Among vocal connoisseurs Miliza Korjus ' silvery , agile recordings of such challenging arias as the Bell Song from Lakm and the Queen of the Night Aria from The Magic Flute had roused admiration and curiosity . But until this week , almost none of her phonographic fans had heard her in the flesh . When she walked on Carnegie Hall 's stage and launched into Lucia 's Mad Scene and an assortment of Mozart and Verdi fireworks , they lent attentive ears . Soprano Korjus flatted on a couple of high notes , sang a phrase or two off pitch . Her high Ds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of her arias with grace and ease . By the intermission , her fans had already reached a verdict : Miliza Korjus is not quite as good as her recordings , but she is one of the best coloraturas U.S. concertgoers have heard in a decade . <P> In the Tradition . First-rank coloratura sopranos seldom appear oftener than once in a generation . The nearest thing to such a voice that this generation of U.S. operagoers is familiar with is the neat , flutelike warbling of Lily Pons . She is the capable but hardly startling descendant of a great line beginning with Jenny Lind and including Adelina Patti , Nellie Melba , Luisa Tetrazzini , Amelita Galli-Curci . Measuring Korjus against the yardstick of their memories , old-timers placed her somewhere near the Pons mark , admired the warmth , vibrancy and agility of her voice , which reminded them slightly of Melba 's . <P> Miliza Korjus ' belated U.S. debut seemed of a piece with the rest of her eccentric career . Daughter of a Swedish diplomat and a Polish woman , she was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's assignments , she attended some 16 continental conservatories , winding up at Paris . While there , she was spotted by RCA Victor recording scouts , got her first recording contract while she was still a student . Miliza Korjus was married to a Swedish engineer who wanted her to settle down and raise a family . But her records created such a furor that she was catapulted into a career in spite of herself . They attracted Germany 's famed Conductor Wilhelm Furtwngler , who auditioned her for the Berlin Opera . She sang there , off &; on , for a couple of years , recorded about 50 arias for Victor on the side . <P> Under the Spell . By 1937 Korjus records had reached Hollywood , where they delighted M.G.M. 's directors , who were looking for a lead for The Great Waltz . Korjus thus became a movie celebrity before the U.S. musical public had even heard of her . Then Korjus was injured in an automobile accident , spent nearly a year in a Santa Monica hospital writing a book " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she disappeared into Mexico , for four years let the musical world go hang . As she explained it later : " I fell in love weeth a man . "
