Hermann Gring was first . Slimmed down , limply clad in a grey suit that once fitted him snugly , he strode into the courtroom at Nrnberg , flanked by two white-helmeted military policemen . He stood erect under the glaring lights , fixed headphones to his ears . British Presiding Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence looked sternly down on the No. 2 Nazi and pronounced sentence : death by hanging . <P> It was the last act in the drama of the war crimes trial that had begun ten months before . It moved swiftly . Gring took off his headphones , turned swiftly about , was ushered to the elevator outside . On the way he passed Joachim von Ribbentrop . <P> The champagne salesman who had risen to become Foreign Minister to Adolf Hitler , stood before the bar , adjusted headphones with shaking hands , listened . Again the sentence : death . Ribbentrop ( whose von turned out to be a social-climbing affectation ) quivered , seemed about to fall . The M.P . ' s helped him from the courtroom . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rudolf Hess . He brushed aside the headphones which would have brought him the German translation of Justice Lawrence 's sentence in English : life imprisonment . Not by a flicker of an eyelash did fox-chinned Hess betray surprise at the clemency he had received . The mill ground on . <P> Sentenced to death : <P> Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel , Chief of Adolf Hitler 's High Command . <P> Ernst Kaltenbrunner , burly , scar-faced No. 2 man to the late Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler . <P> Alfred Rosenberg , high priest of Naziism , publisher of Hitler 's Vlkischer Beobachter , ranting preacher of race hatred . <P> Hans Frank , onetime lawyer , Governor General of occupied Poland . <P> Wihelm Frick , Minister of the Interior in Hitler 's first cabinet and longtime bureaucrat of the regime . <P> Julius Streicher , brutish publisher of Nrnberg 's Der Strmer , No.1 i Jew-baiter of the regime and possessor of what was said to have been the world 's largest collection of pornographic literature . <P> Fritz Sauckel , boss of slave labor . <P> Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Arthur Seyss-lnquart , Austria 's Quisling and Nazi Governor General of The Netherlands . <P> To the surprise of all who heard ( and against the violent dissent of the Russian member of the four-man tribunal ) three Nazi bigwigs were acquitted : <P> Hjalmar Schacht , Hitler 's financial wizard , who had broken with the regime and wound up in a concentration camp . <P> Hans Fritzsche , No. 2 man to the late Joseph Goebbels in the Propaganda Ministry , whose plea that he was an errand boy to Goebbels apparently was believed by the court . <P> Franz von Papen , sly oldtime German diplomat , World War I spy , and jobholder under Hitler from 1933 down to the end . <P> For the rest there was neither death sentence nor acquittal , but prison : <P> Grand Admiral Erich Raeder , builder of the German Navy ; life . <P> Walther Funk , President of the Reichsbank , Hitler 's press chief and economic adviser ; life . <P> Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz , originator of the submarine wolf-pack tactics , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler-chosen chief of what was left ; 10 years . <P> Baldur von Schirach , 39-year-old head of the Hitler Youth organization ; 20 years .
