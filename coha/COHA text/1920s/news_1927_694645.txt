txt Congress will soon be called on to decide a future American immigration policy . The adoption of the national origins provision of the act of 1924 , which was intended to furnish a permanent immigration law for the country , was postponed for . one year during the last session , largely due to the influence of alien-minded groups hyper-sensitive to their fernier national allegiances . This influence will be felt again as immigration comes up again in congress . It is because of the renewed threat of this organized pressure that the expected action of congress in of great interest and Importance . Shall the immigration question be decided from the viewpoint of American welfare , or from the viewpoint of alien factions seeking special privilege for the countries of their ancestry ? So far as numbers are concerned , the aims of restrictive immigration are met by both the national origins system and the temporarily extended system now in force , which is based on the census of 1890 . So far as the question of the Northwest European-southeast European ratio is concerned , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system come principally from within the northwest European group . The national orens system has this important merit , that it bases its quotas , not on the distribution of the alien population In any one year , but on ' virtually the whole white population of the United States in 1920 according to its origin by birth or ancestry . It provides that , so far as the influence of immigration extends , the United States shall remain as it is . But granted that the system , like the two under Consideration , fulfills the chief purposes for which restrictive immigration was established , it is not , after all , a question of the exact machinery of quota limitation . The main issue Is the theory according to which the machinery is selected . Congress ' task is to adopt the machinery which will best serve America .. It may be the national origins system , the 1890 census plan , or some other which appeals to congress as still mere in keeping with the needs of the United States . The question before congress is whether its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not organized  --  or where it Ls , it has been unfortunately led off on issues which have drawn it into intolerance , bigotry , and corruption .. Alien and hyphenated opinion , on the other hand , is organized and sensitive to exploitation by political opportunists . It is often vociferoui and , when incited to a show of strength , can be numerically compelling . In so far as the claims of racial factions are based on a desire to lose the tag of " foreigner that Americans of the brahmin class have attached to them , in so far as they are the outcome of a desire to be recognized as Americans and contributors to the America of today , they deserve a. sympathetic hearing , the fairest treatment , and the correction of any injustices they can show in the immigration laws . But when their arguments pass beyond the limits of such just patriotic aspirations they sanrifloo any claim to the attention of an American congress . The place for such arguments to be made is to the foreign oftle.cs of the countries invo/ved , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to international usage . If congress win draw and enforce this distinction in framing an tmmigratton potty , the United St*/ will get an American and not an alien tin-migration law .
