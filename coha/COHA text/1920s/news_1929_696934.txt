txt The Furness-Bermuda steamship Fort Victoria , outward bound for Hamilton , was halted at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon in the dense fog at the entrance to Ambrose Channel . The pilot was going over the rainswept side of the vessel to a dory which was to take him to the pilot boat luffing near by . The fog had come down heavier than at any time during  --  the last six days , during which the treacherous mists have been virtual masters of shipping at this port . The moan of sirens , the timed beat of melancholy bells and the sobbing blasts of whistle markers sounded on all side : : . Suddenly out of the gray clouds of fog a tall , sharp prow appeared . The Clyde liner Algonquin , equally blind in the sea 's greatest menace , was steaming out for Galveston . Unable to avoid the ship ahead , the Algonquin cut a deep hole in the Fort Victoria , amidships on the port Ride . The water rushed in and almost at once the Fort Victoria was without power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Help Sent Out . An emergency dynamo was put in commission on the Bermuda steamship and calls for help went out from her and from the Clyde liner . As coast guard vessels , police launches and tugs started down the bay the pilot boat New Yorker moved in alongside the stricken Fort Victorh . Accommodation ladders were lowered and 206 passengers , the entire list , and all but 12 men of the crew of 165 went down to the bobbing pilot ship . They remained there until four tugs , led by the oceangoing wrecker Relief , came to the scene at 7 o'clock and the passengers and crew were transhipped . The passengers on the Clyde liner remained aboard her . While the Algonquin , which was damaged only at the bow , stood by , Captain A. R. Francis , master of the British boat , refused to leave the Fort Victoria . Twelve of his crew remained with him . A gallant fight was begun to keep the Bermuda boat afloat . The Fort Vctoria , however , went down at 7:30 P. M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbine . Searchlights Trained on Ship . When the captain and his men left the doomed vessel she was canted over 45 degrees and settling rapidly . As the steamship disappeared in the fog-topped sea , the Fort Victoria was focused in the beams of searchlights trained on her by the ships standing by . The transfer of the passengers of the Fort Victoria in the fog was an experience that few of them will forget . This was made clear shortly after 8 o'clock when 144 of them were landed from the pilot boat Sandy Hook at the Coast Guard base at Stapleton , Staten Island . Two hours later the pilot boat New York landed 140 passengers and members of the crew at the base . In addition to the accommodation ladders many of the passengers left the ' stricken steamship by lifeboats . The passengers were directed to the boats by stewards and members of the deck crew and the boats were lowered , in some instances , to the water . Many passengers were taken from the lowered boats . There was no panic at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers , following the seamen 's example , were calm and self-possossed . At least one lifeboat of the Fort Victoria was smashed when the bow of the Algonquin cut into the aide . Another boat was suspended over the side of the Fort Victoria for thirty minutes before the falls were let go and the lifeboat was rowed to the pilot boat . The Furness Bermuda Line had arranged for accommodations for the passengers at the Hotel and . after , xefresinnuats at the Coa.s4 Guard station they were taken to the Station they were taken to the hotel . Captain Francis and thirty-five of his crew , including the deck officers , landed from a tug at Pier 95 at the foot of West Fifty-fifth Street at . 11:20 P. M. He refused to discuss the collision . Fort Victoria Off on Schedule . The Fort Victoria left its pier at the foot of West Fifty-fifth Street at 11 A. M. yesterday , its scheduled hour of sailing . Because of the density of the fog which clung close to the Hudson and grew ever heavier as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship ran at half speed , with its fog whistle sounding a warning at regular intervals . The vessel came abreast of Quarantine at 12:56 P. M. and passed on down the Ambrose Channel to the lightship and the point where the pilot boat waited . In accordance with custom the master of the Fort Victoria ordered the engines stopped and the vessel floated with the tide as the  --  pilot dropped over the side . The Algonquin got away from her pier at the foot of Spring Street at noon . She was scheduled to make a stop at Miami on her voyage to the Texas port . Captain John , regularly in command of another vessel of the Clyde Line , pursued the same cautious navigation tactics of Captain Francis on the trip down the bay . Whether the fog whistle of the Fort Victoria was not sounding as the steamship paused at the entrance to . the channel , or whether the blasts were lost in the chorus of sounds , were questions unanswered last night . As the sharp bow of the speedy Clyde liner cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel , many of the Fort Victoria 's passengers were at luncheon . An alarm was sounded and they went to the decks . Some confusion resulted when the regular dynamos of the ship , supplied by the engine room , went out as the engineers ' quarters were flooded . A few lights . were managed from the emergency dynamo , and the radio officer on duty began pounding out his calls for aid . A quick inspection of the Algonquin showed that although badly stove in at the bow she was not taking in water . Captain ordered his wireless operator to flash the distress call . The radio of the pilot boat New York caught the calls as pilots and crew , hearing as well as seeing the collision , stood by and the boat got under way . In a matter of minutes the pilot ship was alongside the Fort Victoria and the passengers began filing down the ladders to the deck of the New York . Meanwhile the water in the engine hold was gaining fast . Within a short time the Fort Victoria had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crew had gone over the rails to the rescue vessel the Bermuda steamship had heeled over fifteen degrees . This list , while not in itself dangerous , was becoming greater all the time , so Captain Francis reinforced his calls for aid . The radio messages flashing in from the doorstep of the harbor got immediate response . At the first call all broadcasting in the metropolitan area was suspended and the radio world , figuratively , bent forward to catch the brief messages telling of the struggle outside  --  in fog and rain . The first S 0 S from the damaged steamship was received a few minutes past 4 o'clock through the station of the Mackay Radio Company in Broad Street . It was followed by a terse announcement that the ship had been rammed and that help was needed at once . " Ship Listing , " Says Message . A lull in the messages ensued , and then at 4:42 P. M. the tense operator in the financial district heard : " Snip listing . May have to abandon any minute now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred and what was happening to the passengers . This led to all manner of speculation and gave rise to reports that many persons had been drowned or injured . At 4:50 the wireless operator of the Fort Victoria again sent word crackling into the ether . His message , an ominous one , was as follows : " Crew abandoning the ship . Goodbye . " Five minutes sped by . Radio men on ship and ashore visualized the scene . Then a reassuring message came from the Bermuda liner . It reported that Captain Francis and twelve of his men had elected to remain on board , and that the first of the salvaging tugs had come in sight . All passengers and the remainder of the crew , the message added , had been safely transhipped to the pilot boat and the Algonquin was standing by . Brief dispatches were received and released by the Third District Naval Communications Service in the Whitehall Building , but they merely reported that the Fort Victoria was still afloat . At 5 P. M. the marine division of the Police Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the steamship Lemira , bound in , had joined the Algonquin in standing by the d'sabled ship . A wait of ten minutes and then the police radio reported that the Fort Victoria was . still holding up and that the sea continued smooth . The polies wireless then placed the scene of the collision as " near the pilot boat . " The pilot tenders Columbine and Skelton were hovering near the Fort Victoria , the police added , ready for any emergency . Standing in close also was the Coast Guard patrol boat 128 . It was this boat , according to early report , which picked Captain Francis and his volunteer crew of twelve men out of the water when the Fort Victoria went under . Captain Francis remained on the bridge of his craft until the last minute . Even when he went over the side he held to a guy rope . A sailor in one of the lifeboats of the sinking ship rowed over to Captain Francis and pulied him in with a boat hook . The twelve other men were picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Scene . The offices of the Furness-Withy Company , which operates the Furness Bermuda Line , asked the Merritt Chapman Scott Wrecking and Salvage Company to dispatch its largest tugs to the scene . The Relief started down the bay early , but apparently encountered some difficulty in locating the pilot boat in the fog . The Relief was to join in the battle to keep the Fort Victoria afloat . The line also engaged 210 rooms at the at the time the Relief left her Battery pier . Later the line received unofficial reports that because of the increasing danger of the Fort Victoria 's sinking , the Clyde liner had been manoeuvred alongside and lashed to the stricken ship . On the other side of the Bermuda vessel , said the reports , four tugs were steaming . At 6:36 P. M. the police radio re-ported : " Passengers still aboard the pilot boat . S. S. Algonquin still standing by , offers to remove passengers . Fort Victoria is waiting for tugs , still listing to starboard and taking water . Position of the Fort Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The radio station of the Coast Guard at Far Rockaway , L. I. , next heard the Fort Victoria and the Relief in wireless conversation . The message from the ship to the tug was as follows : " One tug towing us from Fairway Buoy to Channel buoys . We require your assistance as soon as possible . " Captain Francis himself wirelessed the line at 7 P. M. , saying that there had been no loss of life and " not even a minor injury to any one . " At that hour the master was confident that his ship would remain afloat . Algonquin Stays at Anchor . Two hours after Captain Francis had reported to his owners Captain of . the Algonquin sent a message to the Clyde Line . He said that his ship was still anchored in the dense fog , just off the Whistling Buoy , a short distance this side of the Ambrose Lightship near the entrance to the channel . He indicated that he might remain there all night rather than attempt to bring his large ship up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John E. Craig , first vice president of the Clyde-Mallory Lines , said : " Our latest information is that the Algonquin is anchored off Ambrose Channel lightship in a dense fog and the master does not expect to dock until tomorrow morning . We have no detailed information as to the extent of the Algonquin 's damage other than that there is no immediate danger and that the passengers are all safe . " Another official of the line said that Captain was one of the oldest masters in the company 's service , " a regular sea-faring man " in whom they had the utmost confidence . " The accident happened in an unprecedented fog , " this official declared . " It was just one of those things . " While the passengers and crew were being landed at the Coast Guard base a message from the tug Relief emphasized the density of the fog outside the harbor . The skipper of the tug wirelessed at 9 o'clock that he was cruising about off the channel trying to find the pilot boats . The Relief had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the survivors at the Stapleton base were receiving spare clothing , and passengers and crew were heartily enjoying sandwiches and hot coffee , arrangements were made at Pier 95 at West Fifty-seventh Street , one of the Furness Bermuda piers , to handle other survivors who were expected there . A restaurant opposite the pier was requisitioned solely for the expected passengers , and piles of clothing for the crew were heaped on the pier . Several big containers of coffee were made ready and automobile buses were stationed outside to whisk the passengers to the . H. C. Blackiston , a director of the Furness Bermuda line , reached the pier at 10 P. M. He said that reports to the line indicated that the Fort Victoria could not be salvaged . He said the point where the ship went down was too deep for any efforts to raise her to be successful . Mr. Blackiston said he understood that three boats bearing passengers or crew were coming up the bay , but were having great difficulty because of the fog . Mr. Blackiston estimated the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was partly covered by insurance . The loss of passengers ' baggage , he said , was fully protected by insurance . Few relatives of passengers were at the West Fifty-seventh Street pier . A brother and two sisters of Edward Fleigel , who , with his bride , were a honeymoon couple on board the Fort Victoria , were among those awaiting the arrival of the tugs . Mr. Fleigel was married last Sunday . He is a manufacturer and lives at 1,426 Forty-seventh Street , Brooklyn . The Bermuda Line said that passengers who decided to do so could leave for St. George and Hamilton in the Bermudas today on the Fort St. George , sister ship of the lost steamship . Passengers on the Algonquin for Miami can leave this morning on the Cherokee of the Clyde Line , which goes to Jacksonville , from which point they can journey by rail to Miami . Passengers for Galveston , however , will have to wait for the Henry R. Mallory , which is scheduled to sail on Dec. 28.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
