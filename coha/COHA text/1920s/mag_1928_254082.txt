Valor 's a mousetrap . . . . <P> In all the trade of war no feat <P> Is nobler than a brave retreat . <P> - Butler 's Hudibras . <P> The city of Peking , for five centuries the traditional Capital of China , fell last week to the South Chinese Nationalist Armies . Noble was the evacuation carried out by the great Marshal Chang Tso-lin . Scarcely a retreat , and in no sense a rout , the War Lord 's departure took on the semblance of a stately pilgrimage . The event was of paramount importance because , for the first time in the present decade of Civil War , it can now be substantially claimed that all of China proper is under a single regime-the Nationalist Government , founded by the late , famed and revered Dr. Sun Yatsen , and led to victorious dominion by its present Generalissimo , slender , modest , democratic Chiang Kaishek . <P> Chang Evacuates . Since 1911 the word of War Lord Chang Tso-lin has been and still is law in Manchuria , the vast and fruitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adjacent to Japanese territory . <P> Thus it was to Manchuria that Marshal Chang departed , last week , with his armies , his armored trains , his Packard limousines , his wives , children , concubines , innumerable bastards , faithful retinue. * . . . <P> To emphasize the nobility of the War Lord 's evacuation his son and heir , Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang , remained behind in Peking to hand the city over to the approaching Nationalist Armies . With him remained a little known but thoroughly potent Chinaman-General Yang Yu-ting , sometimes called the " Ludendorff " or " Brains " of Chang Tso-lin . <P> As the War Lord 's sumptuous private train rushed toward Manchuria , preceded and followed by grim armored pilot trains , he knew that only an attack by enemy spies or some supreme treachery among his followers could deprive him of life or his great wealth . The unexpected and improbable occurred when two Nationalist spies were able to intercept Chang 's train with shrewdly tossed bombs , which smashed three railway cars , but injured the War Lord very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bizarre opinion that valor is a mouse trap was quaintly justified by the circumstances which caused Chang Tso-lin to withdraw from Peking last week , without fighting any final pitched engagement or making a theatrical " last stand .

Therefore the Japanese General Staff , although exceedingly friendly to Chang Tso-lin , recently gave warning ( TIME , May 28 ) that neither he nor any other Chinese would be permitted to enter Manchuria for purposes of active warfare . <P> Third , the effect of this situation was that if War Lord Chang had fought a last engagement at Peking , suffered defeat , and then retired still fighting and chased by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off by the Japanese .
