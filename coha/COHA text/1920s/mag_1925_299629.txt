The pyrotechnics recently seen in Radio Corporation shares on the Stock Exchange has attracted universal attention to this new business . Last fall the stock sold as low as $26.87 a share . From this level they have rushed up as high as $77.75 a share . Investors are now questioning how far this advance has been justified by earnings of the Radio Corporation . <P> Altogether , there are 1,500,000 common shares authorized , of which 1,155,400 have been issued . Of the latter , 762,000 shares ( or 65% ) were recently held by the General Electric , the Westinghouse and the United Fruit Companies , leaving 393,400 shares ( about 35% ) in the hands of individual security investors and speculators . Since many of these latter are held by what Wall Street calls " firm hands , " the floating supply of Radio common shares is not large , unless the three above-named corporations have begun to sell out their large holdings . Consequently , the amount of stock available in the stock market , temporarily at least , is not large . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1921 they were $4,189,031 ; in 1922 , $15,101,044 ; in 1923 , $26,570,814 ; and in 1924 they are estimated at $45,000,000 , or about $4.00 a share on outstanding common shares . The speculation in Radio shares is obviously prompted by the apparently limitless future of the new industry . Sales of radio sets and parts have increased from $2,000,000 in 1920 to $400,000,000 in 1924 , and the " saturation point " is still apparently far away . The radio industry appeals to the average American 's imagination , and how far it will fatten his pocketbook remains to be seen .
