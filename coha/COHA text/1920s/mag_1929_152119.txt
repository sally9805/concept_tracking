A convention is usually an occasion upon which tycoons who are not orators deliver speeches prepared for them by secretaries who are not writers . This handicap , coupled with the further hazard that convention speeches are generally highly conventional , tends to throw the value of a convention upon the personal contacts established rather than upon the official business transacted . Thus it is somewhat questionable whether the Sixteenth National Foreign Trade Convention at Baltimore last week made any epochal advances in the solution of problems of foreign trade . Still many an Exporter met many an Importer ; many sound , if not startling , pronouncements were made concerning international commerce ; and everybody appeared to be agreed upon the fact that foreign trade was an exceedingly good thing and that there ought to be more of it . <P> The Convention opened with a few well Hoover-chosen words from Washington ; then came many another greeting radioed from absent speakers in distant lands , on distant seas . During the long-distance conversations there was heard the loud popping of a champagne cork . No illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Berlin hotel of Ernst Filsinger , head of the Export Managers ' Club of New York . Exporter Filsinger told the delegates that he was very sorry not to be in Baltimore with them . Then he made his champagne cork pop , thus testifying to the miracles of modern science and perhaps to the alleviating circumstances of his absence .
