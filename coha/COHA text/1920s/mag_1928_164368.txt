In The Wall Street Journal , published by Clarence Walker Barron , the following words appeared one morning last week : <P> " Clarence W. Barron , financier , philanthropist , editor , author , philosopher and publisher of The Wall Street Journal , the Boston News Bureau , the Philadelphia News Bureau and Barron 's , the National Financial Weekly , is authority for the foregoing statements and certainly there is no man in the United States today better qualified to talk . ... It also might be stated without fear of contradiction that Mr. Barron is one of the most difficult men in Palm Beach to catch for an interview . . . . However , when he was cornered-the word is well chosen-in his sunny apartment in Whitehall overlooking Lake Worth yesterday morning , he graciously consented to talk on anything from Wall Street to the human ear-the latter being one of his absorbing interests at present . . . . " <P> Wall Street men were amazed that so large and distinguished a person as Mr. Barron should allow himself to receive so large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the excuse for the story ? It was an important excuse-a tremendous excuse . Mr. Barron , in his " foregoing statements , " had said : <P> " Charles E.

President- <P> " And there is little if any danger of a drastic reaction in the stock market as a result of wild trading .
