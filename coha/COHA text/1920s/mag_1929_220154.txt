Queen of the Night Clubs ( Warner ) . Although Broadway night clubs have served as a locale for more pictures than any other background except the western plains , there has not been one yet in which the patrons neglected to throw confetti or paper streamers , or to rise and cheer when the hostess , with a roll of drums , tripped in . Even now when Texas Guinan , perched on a chair-back with her suckers around her , invokes an atmosphere indisputably authentic , the public is not allowed to forget that her grown son , whom she has not seen for years , will presently turn up and be accused , at the moment he is recognized by her , of a murder committed by someone else . Feeble directing of these elements is compensated chiefly by the beautiful legs of Lila Lee as a night club entertainer . Best shot : Texas Guinan asking for a hand . <P> Mary Louise Guinan ran away from Denver in 1904 with a reporter whom she married and later left to join a musical show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she became famous after 20 years in vaudeville , stock , and westerns , as hostess of her own Manhattan night-club-the El Fay . An El Fay waiter sold a bottle to a customer with a badge and the club was given a padlock and a front-page story . In a new club Hostess Guinan continued to greet her friends with " Hello , Johnny " and her paying clients with " Hello , sucker . " ; Keeping her ebullience corsetable with a diet of broccoli and orange juice , she shouts " Pull up your water wings " whenever somebody upsets a bottle and " Give this little girl a hand " when her well disciplined revue girls perform . Recurring padlocks merely furnished publicity for the launching of new Guinan clubs . The current one is the Texas Guinan 's Club Intime in 54th Street . Amiable , witty , sentimental , blonde , mercenary , she keeps her age a secret , crosses herself when she sees a policeman , has millionaires thrown out of her club if they get rowdy , lives quietly with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Booth Tarkington , amiable observer of smalltown surfaces , thought and wrote about a homely girl whose father brought home a bright young man to make her happy . The producers and players ( Albert Gran , Marion Nixon , Eddie Quillan ) got the drift of the thing , but not the kindly , Tarkingtonian sparkle . The result is only fairish . <P> Sonny Boy ( Warner ) . Cast as the title of a theme-song , young Davey Lee created in The Singing Fool a demand for a picture in which he would be starred . Few critics dared to suppose that the vehicle would be more than a sentimental nimbus around the small Lee smile . They found instead an amusing and at times witty farce involving the efforts of a mother to keep a husband , from whom she is separated , from stealing his son . Lee ( 4 in May ) is younger and funnier than Jackie Coogan was when he made The Kid with Charles Chaplin . Best shot : Sonny Boy in the clothes-hamper.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
