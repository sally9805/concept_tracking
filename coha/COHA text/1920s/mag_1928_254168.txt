Gradually , in the U. S. , outdoor music has come to have its proper share of attention , from philanthropists , from able musicians , from audiences . For example : In Manhattan , there are two important outdoor organizations . One is the Goldman Band which plays songs and marches , operatic arias and favorite symphonies in Central Park , or on the campus of New York University . These concerts cost nothing to hear . Sponsored by the Guggenheims ( Mr. &; Mrs. Daniel and Mr. &; Mrs. Murray ) , they are conducted by Edwin Franko Goldman , who , ever since the concerts began eleven years ago , has never missed a performance . For denizens of Manhattan who prefer cigaret smoking to gum-chewing , Willem van Hoogstraten to Franko Goldman , and paying 25 to $1 for a seat to listening for nothing , there are the Philharmonic concerts at the Lewisohn Stadium . These are sponsored by Mrs. Charles S. Guggenheimer . <P> In Chicago , sponsored by Louis Eckstein , there are the Ravinia Park concerts . When she arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing in the premiere , Mme. Rethberg suffered an unpredictable failure of voice . Since there was no understudy for her role in Verdi 's Masked Ball , it was necessary to revise the entire program for the first night . Queena Mario and Giovanni Martinelli sang the leads in Pagliacci which was followed by Cavalleria Rusticana . <P> Louis Eckstein is one of those extraordinary men who are able to associate themselves simultaneously and successfully with totally dissimilar enterprises . He publishes the Red Book ; its staff regards him solely as an expert upon what the public likes to read . The men who help him with the Ravinia Park scheme never for a moment doubt that this is his principal interest in the world . Ever since 1913 , when he started the concerts by engaging the Chicago Symphony for a summer , he has kept the programs of the Ravinia music . Now , when asked about the history of his Ravinia Park concerts , Louis Eckstein points to these musical menus bound in 15 thick volumes . " There is my history , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made opera its harmonic pasturage . The municipal company , less brilliant than Chicago 's , including no Rethbergs or Martinellis , has a pleasant scheme of giving away many seats and selling many others , thus satisfying all comers . In nine years it has accumulated a surplus of some $40,000 . <P> In Cincinnati functions the well-named and famous Zoo Opera , numbering among its baritones Robert Ringling , nephew of the Circus poo-bah ( TIME , Nov. 28 ) . More ambitious than most , the Cincinnati vocalists intend this year to specialize in Wagner , for he is an idol with local auditors . Later , for the last three weeks of their season , they will concentrate on light opera , especially the works of Gilbert and Sullivan , a source of fatigue to the listening monkeys .
