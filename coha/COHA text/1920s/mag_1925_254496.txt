At Harvard University , 289 years ago , a meal of baked beans and fish cakes was served in the university Commons . The undergraduate body- " two nephews of the president and the professor 's son " - complained bitterly about the fish cakes . They added that the butter was bad . For many years thereafter , good wholesome fare was served in Commons , at the sight of which Harvard students laid down their table implements ; sweet dairy butter was passed at which they bit their thumbs . Things reached a crisis about the butter , in colonial days , when a " Butter Rebellion " was organized , and Harvard funny men chanted a petition alleging that " our butter stinketh , - give us therefore , butter that stinketh not . " Sir Thomas Bernard , the Royal Governor , suppressed the insurgent popinjays , but the spirit of the dead rebellion lingered noticeably in the air . There have been , from time to time , other unpleasant outbursts . White cloths were put upon the tables , meal tickets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no good . Men have continued to hurry from the hall with anxious looks , crying wildly that the butter was after them . Last week , another Harvard tradition fell . Memorial Hall Commons , gulfed in an increasing deficit , was abandoned .
