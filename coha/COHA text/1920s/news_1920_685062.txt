txt GERMANY 'S PAYMENT . World Should Not Abate Just Demands , but Be Patient . To the Editor of the New York Times : What Germany needs is a breathing spell during which to gather her industrial forces . Given time , her recovery ( in commerce and industry ) is certain . Her factories and land are undamaged . The mental acumen which enabled her . to undersell other nations in the world 's markets is still there , and will manifest itself again . And when : t good str:t is once made , the speed of her recovery is apt to surprise us all . For the awful loss of life and suet of human suffering she has brought upon the world she can never pay . She can not , and has not been asked to pay , even the incidental money loss which she has caused to outside nations . But she can pay the full amount of the actual physical damage clone by her  --  the reparation demanded and still to be demanded of her , What has become clear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany the capital needed to start her on the road to recovery . But the world will be fooled by her if it is led , by the present propaganda , to abate in any way the final payment of its just demands . THEODORE . MARB Baltimore , Feb. 27 , 1020 . Mr. Shaw 's Views on Ireland . You will , I am sure , permit me to correct I an unintended mistake in the report published in the Sunday Trap 's . ef remarks by , me at the Saturday luncheon of the National Republican Club . The general subject under discussion was American responsibility hi the period of reconstruction . Now , as to the , point in your report , which you will allow me to correct : in answer to a question about ? Ireland , i stated that I had favored house rule from the Illadstonlan period , but appreciated the Brit ish arguments for maintaining the Union . 1 spoke of the new compromise Dome Rule bill as introduced last week in the I Rinse of Commons , and declared that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fantastic , and worthy of hopeful consideration . Through sonic misunderstanding , your reporter makes those allusions apply to the recent suggestion of Mr. de Valera , which ' concedes that an independent Irish republic might accept a British Monroe Doctrine . I made no allusion whatever to Mi. de Valera or to the Irish Republic and I happen not at all to entertain The views attributed to me . On the contrary , I believe that the union between Great . Britain and Ireland should be maintained . My allusion was solely to the new home rule proposals with the two Parliaments , the plans for the . joint Commission ( somewhat like the old arrangements between ( lie Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments ) , and the inducements offered for the further . development of this Joint Commission .
