All week long , not only in Russia but in many countries throughout the world , the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Bolshevist regime was celebrated . <P> Moscow , festooned in red , was the centre of proletarian manifestations . Here 30,000 field-grey soldiers marched past Mikhail Ivanovitch Kalinin , so-called President of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics , who took the salute from the top of the Lenin tomb in Red Square . Behind the troops came 250,000 picked workers , preceded by a monster , two-headed green dragon . One of the heads represented , monocle &; all , Sir Austen Chamberlain , British Foreign Secretary ; the other , Prime Minister Benito Mussolini of Italy , with the Fascist swastika above his forehead . <P> Above an open window in a house near the Kremlin Gate that still bears the name of Trotsky there stretched a large red streamer in the centre of which was a large picture of L. D. Trotsky himself . Matters grew serious when at the open window there appeared the head of Trotsky in the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo Borisovitch Kam-ener . Some of the crowd jeered , others cheered . Then something attracted their attention . <P> That something turned out to be a man on the roof trying his utmost to tear the red streamer down . With a bellow like a bull 's the giant Mura-lov , onetime commander of the Moscow garrison and Trotsky 's most devoted follower , elbowed his way through the crowd , scaled the side of the house like a human fly , mounted the roof , caught the offender by the scruff of the neck and the seat of the trousers , carried him to the edge of the roof , and dropped him from a safe height to the ground , where , terrified , he scampered off . <P> Hour after hour the procession wended its way through the square . A short speech by M. Kalinin was the signal for the singing of the International , which was taken up by the miles of parading populace . Simultaneously , the Kremlin*guns roared salvos of blank shells for six minutes , their blue smoke spiraling upwards around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spasski Gate . <P> In Moscow 's big parade every branch of the army took part , and there were Red sailors , too . Caucasian cavalry dashed by , their gleaming sabres at salute , their long black capes flowing behind ; protection troops , wearing their round astrakhan caps , passed by , a little regiment of dwarfs , to the tune of the famed " Volga Boat song " ; then came the Turkoman cavalry at a sharp trot , wearing their huge black shakos and great ponchos . Many of the civilian men and women wore weird costumes of the Middle Ages . <P> All this to celebrate the achievement of ten years of Bolshevist rule . <P> What is this achievement ? <P> Last week , had a U. S. observer been in Russia ( more particularly in Moscow ) he might have noted , besides some noteworthy counterdemonstrations by the Oppositionists accompanied by fisty brawls , some of the following factors : <P> Voters . He might have been struck by the full meaning of the revolution : the substitution of one privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia the workers are the aristocracy , and the former aristocracy and the bourgeoisie rank even lower than did the workers under the Tsars-they do not count at all . Only workers &; peasants over the age of 18 can vote .
