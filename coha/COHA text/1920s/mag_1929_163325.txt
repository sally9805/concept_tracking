THEY STOOPED TO FOLLY-Ellen Glasgow-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> Milly Burden became pregnant in a small Virginia town . Her lover , Martin Welding , a nervewracked U. S. soldier , had returned to France after the War . Yet Lawyer Littlepage , to whom Milly was secretary , forbore to dismiss her despite her flippancy , her sullen desire to live her own life regardless of the opinions of others . Furthermore Milly reminded Lawyer Littlepage of his daughter , Mary Victoria . Encouraged by softness , Milly confided her worry over Welding 's nerves . In return , Lawyer Littlepage had Mary Victoria , who was in Europe , look Welding up . <P> This Mary did , so successfully and with such persistence and missionary zeal that the two returned from Europe as man and wife . Soon Mary Victoria was pregnant , too , but that did not prevent Welding from deserting her " to find a place where there are high mountains and snows that never melt and nothing else except loneliness . " Mary Victoria remained with her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may become a power for good in the life of my child . " Milly went to New York on the trail of " something worth loving . " <P> Other folly-stoopers in the story are Aunt Agatha , still mourning in a third-story back bedroom because she was " betrayed by a Southern gentleman who moved in the best circles but was married already " ; and Mrs. Dalrymple , divorced for infidelity . She " looked as much like a king 's mistress as if she had stepped straight out of profane history , had been obliged to seek moral climes more congenial in profligate Europe . " <P> Author Glasgow , pride of the South , is a good stylist , competent , prolific , weakly satiric , with a high artistic reputation and more than a trace of sentiment .
