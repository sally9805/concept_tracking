Humoresque . Mrs. Sarah Kantor slipped out into the darkness of the ghetto , leaving her husband , one son , and a stray dog asleep in one cot , her daughter in another , and her favorite son whimpering for a violin in another . A few minutes later she reappeared , triumphantly bearing a four-dollar violin . <P> The violin turned out to be a good investment . In the second act its successor is bringing big dividends from audiences flocking to hear the young Yiddish genius . Unhappily , the war has meanwhile started and the violinist feels the call to arms louder than the whispering of his muse , or the terrified protectiveness of his mother . At the end of the act he shakes off her imploring arms and starts off for the war against oppression . <P> All through the last act he is still starting . Everyone , on and off the stage , has a good cry . But the play gets no further . In fact , the play never does get much of anywhere after the first excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything but the astonishing excellences of Miss Laurette Taylor as the infinitely pathetic mother . <P> Alexander Woolloott : " . . . . The bright unwinking star of Laurette Taylor never shone more clearly . " <P> Hey wood Broun : " . . . We have never seen her play better . " <P> Burns Mantle : " . . . . Characterization of the very first quality . " <P> Roger Bloomer . This is another play , like Johannes Kreisler , in the course of which innumerable scenes come popping out at you from all over the stage . They are expressionistic scenes , too , looking like nothing in heaven or earth except dreams of the central character-whose point of view is something to marvel at . <P> The play recounts the mental agonies of a groping adolescent from Iowa who expects wonders of life and can make none of his dreams come true . Iowa and his 100% American home prove too much for him-par-ticularly after an unsuccessful attempt has been made to condemn him to Yale and he flies to New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home-a girl who finds life a hoax and love nothing but filth . <P> He has a series of disillusionments , in chance meetings with street- walkers , bums , financiers . At one point he tries a bottle of rat poison , but finds in it not oblivion but a stomach ache . The girl is more successful in her choice of poisons , and dies on his hands-finding some satisfaction in the reflection that she dies clean . He is unfortunately jailed ; and is visited by his father , who tries unsuccessfully to bring him back to Iowa . The play ends up with an astounding nightmare , in the course of which all the minor characters dance about him , tempting or mocking him , and finally give place to the girl , who , to some extent , cheers him up . <P> New York is identified as a place full of " women , death and garbage . " Yale University is grotesquely libelled in the person of a majestic creature ( the villain ) who catalogues his excellences at the slightest provocation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdities . <P> There are moments of great power . It is a genuine tragedy that the theme and its treatment are unworthy of the courageous experiment of its production . <P> J. Rankin Towse : " . . . an indefinite spectacle of insurgent youth . "
