CLEOPATRA 'S PRIVATE DIARY-Henry Thomas-Stratford ( $2 ) . This imaginary Cleopatra , who goes to Rome with Caesar , certain that " the world needs its Cleopatras as well as it needs its vestal virgins , " is made out to be one of the frankest hussies ever to expose her private doings to print . <P> Rome she finds " a dirty little anthill of Italian filth . " Caesar , her lover , " talks like a very king of kings , but acts like a delicatessen-storekeeper . " He has a fit of epilepsy : " Fancy sharing your bed with a man who is in the habit of turning into a corpse . " She meets Calpurnia , Caesar 's wife . Calpurnia thanks her " for providing me with such an excellent excuse to exercise freely whatever poor talents I possess . " The nature of these talents is reflected in Cleopatra 's diary : " Received this morning a jar of preserved roses from Calpurnia . Fed it to my little pet rabbit . . . . Buried my little pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a world of fun . We would rush up to a house ( in the darkness ) , knock loudly at the door , and then hide ourselves in the shadows . When the door was opened , we let out a long , dismal , wolflike howl , and then ran away giggling in the dark . " <P> Roman punishments : " The Romans have a unique way of punishing some of their criminals . They tie them down on their back in the sun and then cover the victim 's face with a thick layer of molasses for the flies to feast upon . . . . They whip matricides in public , and then they sew them up in a bull 's hide together with a dog , a cock and a monkey , and throw them into the Tiber . " <P> Author " Henry Thomas " is a learned publisher disporting himself with the anonymity so necessary for successful indiscretions in his native Boston . His humor runs sooner to dubious epigrams than to clever psychology and his wit limps much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome he invents neatly . Readers with a weakness for scandal , however frail , will applaud his effort to do with Cleopatra what Professor Erskine did for Helen of Troy .
