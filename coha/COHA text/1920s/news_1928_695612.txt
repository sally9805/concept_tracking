txt When Augustine De La Pierre , eighty-three-year-old recluse , had de ! scended the last four flights leading from his dreary lodgings in the attic of a tenement house at 196 Fulton I Street , yesterday afternoon , he sum-noned William Holowell , the janitor . ? ? There are fresh eggs and bread in the icebox in my kitchen , " the old maa told him . " You may have them if you want . " Holowell noticed that the octogenarian looked haggard . His hands shook more than usual and there was a strange light in his eyes . But the janitor thought no more of it at the time . It was nearly 5 o'clock when Holowell ascended the stairway to the De La Pierre apartment . As he opened the door he saw the body of a man sprawled across a couch in a corner of the room . One look sufficed to show that the man was dead . His head and face had been beaten beyond recognition . A blood-stained mechanic 's hammer lay beside the body . Holowell hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he ran around the corner to the rectory of the Roman Catholic Church of the Assumption and got q priest to accompany him back to the apartment . Aged Man Admits Killing . While the janitor was away , De La Pierre had returned to his lodgings . When Detectives Kenna and Borman arrived from the Poplar Street Station , a few.minutes ahead of Holowell and the . priest , they found . the old man seated in a chair beside the body . As the detectives entered the room he raised an ice pick to his breast and would have stabbed himself had not Kenna struck the pick from his hand . " Yes , I killed him , " De La-Pierre said , when his two visitors told him they were policemen . " He tried to rob me . I was sitting alone in my room yesterday afternoon when he opened the door . His right hand was thrust into his coat pocket as if he had a gun . " ' Stick ' em up , ' he ordered , and I ot eyed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the bedroom where my bank books I an money were .

I reached ' down , grabbed the hammer , and ' before he could get out of ' the way I struck him with all my force . Then I seemed to grow mad I struck him again and again across the face and head , fearful least he should regain consciousness . " When I realized what I had done , I was stupefied . All night long I sat there beside the body , dazed , unable to move from my chair . Dawn came , but still I could not move . " Late in the day I decided there was but one thing to do , to send Holowell to my apartment on one pretense or another and let him find the body . I knew he would tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I walked through the streets waiting for the police to come after me . Every minute I expected them to lay hands upon me . The suspense was horrible , worse than sitting here in the room with the body . " Finally I decided to come back to the room . I felt sure you would be waiting here for me . But when I climbed the stairs and saw the body was still there I thought Holowell had not been here . Only the door was open and I knew I had closed it . " Then I was sure he had gone for the police . They will be here soon now , I told myself , and I went inside and got the ice pick . I am old and I did not want to go to jail .
