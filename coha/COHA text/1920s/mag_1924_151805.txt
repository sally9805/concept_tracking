In the Ruhr district , miners struck for a shorter day and more pay . Other strikes were reported from Saxony and Silesia . Berlin Bolsheviks urged the metal workers and railwaymen to join their Red brethren . Die Rote Fahne ( The Red Flag ) , Berlin Communist journal , proclaimed a new wave of struggle against the hated capitalist system . <P> The sudden increase in Red energy was said to be by way of celebrating Communist gains in the recent election ( TIME , May 12 ) . The Ruhr strike was embarrassing to the German Government , because the industrialists were prevented from making coal shipments to France . It was feared that the French Government would immediately begin to exert pressure . As far as the Ruhr is concerned the French Army can enforce law and order , but Red riots in other parts of Germany were causing serious apprehension . <P> This Communist activity was said to be financed from Russia and evidence to this effect was reputed to be in the hands of the Government .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
