txt While hundreds of men stand helplessly about the mouth of a small tunnel leading into a cave six miles from here and every onoe in a while a dirt begrimed party comes out and another crawls in , Floyd Collins remains prisoner , his left foot held by a rock which has resisted all efforts at removal . He is very weak and at times is reported partially delirious . Renewed efforts , however , were under way late tonight to bring Collins out . A jack has been rigged up and by means of belts fastened to his body it is thought perhaps he can be pulled loose from the rock , with attendant danger , of course , that his foot and leg may be injured . ? There were reports during the day that he had been rescued , but these were later denied . It became known tonight that Collins 's foot is not crushed , but simply held by a viselike grip of the big rock , which is held in place by smaller stones .

Engineers Are Called . Volunteer rescue workers have been constantly engaged since Saturday morning , but all they had been able to do up to tonight was to make Collins a trife more comfortable physically . They carried bed clothing and food to him , ' but they could not free his foot . Governor W. J. Fields this afternoon called to fluty highway , railroad and mining engineers , ordering them to hurry to the cave and see if they can devise some means of , liberating the trapped man , who is about 800 feet from the entrance to the cavern , which he entered early Friday morning and was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged . that his left leg be severed so that he might be dragged out , and today Homer Collins , brother of the prisoner , made an offer of $500 to any surgeon who would go into the cave and amputate the victim 's leg . Collins has been able to direct rescue work part of the time . Every once in a while a man crawls near enough to speak to Collins and reassure him . That is all that can be done aside from taking him food and light . It is believed that efforts may be iiade to sink a shaft through the hill over the spot where Collins lies and an effort made to dig him out . The engineers will try to determine just where he is lying . Jewell Estors , the youth who first discovered Collins 's plight and also managed to squeeze through the opening between wall and boulder carved so laboriously , again made the trip , aroused the victim and fed him coffee and other stimulants .

Men are working in shifts singly and in pairs , - lying prone upon the mucky bottom , faces pressed against jagged stones and bodies in the cold water . At best they chip tiny flakes from the flinty limestone with short blows . At first sledge hammers and cold chisels were used , then several gasoline bloy torches were brought out from cave city garages and these were turned upon the stone , later sledges being used . Progress , however . was tedious . Some study has been made of surveying the cave and attempting to sink a hole from the surface .

Rain Adds to Difficulty . Lanterns are being used to light up the scene where the rescuers are working . Usually the toilers spend from twenty minutes to a half hour , then come out to dry themselves before a fire which is kept going . Parties from different towns have been coming and offering aid . The beginning of a steady rain late yesterday made descent into the cave more difficult , as the cave drains a rather wide surface . Slush and water stood about five inches ' high in many portions of the channels underground and by dark only one person could hammer at the boulder at a time . Collins was fed at S o'clock . At that time he was thoroughly conscious and expressed the hone that his rescue would be effected shortly . Upon one trip made to Collins a tiny pinch bar was given the imprisoned , man .
