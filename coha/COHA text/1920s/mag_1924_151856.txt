The sun and the moon do not shine in the same sky . What use has the sun for the moon , which can grow no corn ? <P> Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis is one of the major luminaries of the publishing world . He did for publishing much what Cyrus H. McCormick did for farming-industrialized a comparatively unorganized business . Having had unimagined success with The Saturday Evening Post and The Ladies ' Home Journal , Mr. Curtis turned to newspapers . First he took the two Public Ledgers ( morning and evening ) of Philadelphia . Last January he reached out to Manhattan and bought the New York Evening Post . In taking control of the Post he took possession of an heirloom . On the list of its editors and owners were Alex ander Hamilton , William Cullen Bryant , John Bigelow , Carl Schurz , E. L. Godkin-great men who had made the Post a landmark of journalism . But these men had passed and the Post was no longer their Post . It was a paper run by a group of wealthy men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper should be-an educated man 's paper , liberal , refined , in good taste . Mr. Curtis changed the Post into what he thought a paper should be-a paper for news , a go-getter for circulation , the kind of intellectual pabulum that could attract a large audience . In making the change he immediately lost Christopher Morley , that most genial of columnists . In general , how ever , he did not destroy the paper of the bygone intellectual giants , because it was no longer their paper . The Post had passed their high-water-mark a generation earlier . But there was one portion of his purchase which has not passed its high-water mark . It was the Literary Review , which was published as part of the Post 's Saturday edition . Back in 1920 , the owners of the Post had cast about to find a man who could adequately conduct the Literary Review . They went to the group of literary professors at Yale-the group which included the fluent William Lyon Phelps , the dramatic Chauncey Brewster Tinker ( author of Young Boswell ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlton M. Lewis , now dead , Dean Wilbur Cross , Editor of the Yale Review , and others less well known . From this group the Post secured Dr. Henry Seidel Canby.
