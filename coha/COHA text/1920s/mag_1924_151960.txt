Regretting that he came to his home department attended by a Premier , surrounded by Ministers and followed by a troupe of Generals , President Gaston Doumergue spoke to " les enfants du Gard " on the value of peace at home and abroad . <P> The simple people of the Department of the Gard ( South France ) apparently did not understand the speech , but they were glad to see their dear , smiling " Gastonnet " once more and loudly they cheered him . Said Gastonnet to them , alluding to the Alsace-Lorraine religious dispute : " Long experience has taught me that ideas never gain ground by being either spread or defended with violence . Violence adds nothing to their virtue when they have any ; and it serves only to hide their appeal , to prevent their diffusion and sometimes to make them highly objectionable . Ideas which have need of violence to attain diffusion and become accepted never lead to happiness , liberty or lasting peace and they never produce a very high or very human civilization .
