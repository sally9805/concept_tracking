Dark as the inside of an empty wine cask and reeking with the same stale smells is a certain evil subterranean cafe in Warsaw . Last week Polish detectives surrounded silently , peered down and into the place expectantly . They saw M. Aaron ( " Diamond Jew " ) Rubenstein in strange traffic with some two score creatures whose air was furtive , smugglerous . <P> Cuddled in many an upturned palm were diamonds . Shaken lovingly from soft , drawstring pouches they twinkled and tumbled in the hot light of three gas jets . The sight , the low babble of bidding , was evidence enough for detectives . <P> Boots kicked in cellar windows . Shoulders crashed open the door . Then , while detectives stumbled down steep rickety stairs or dropped in through windows , " Diamond Jew " Rubenstein and friends cupped palms to their mouths , leaned back , and amazingly swallowed diamonds . Uncut stones too big to swallow were flung madly anywhere-behind the bar , into corners , out windows . <P> Thorough frisking by detectives of their prey showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the legal taxes and import duties had been paid upon their diamonds . With anguished faces and painful stomachs , they watched while unswallowed diamonds to a total weight of 2,000 carats were swept and gathered up by the police . <P> Not classed as a mere creature , according to despatches , was M. Aaron ( " Diamond Jew " ) Rubenstein , who was recently employed by the Polish Government to appraise a shipment of onetime Tsarist diamonds sent for sale in Poland by the Soviet Government . Perhaps it was that service which secured for M. Rubenstein a private cell and communication with his lawyer , although the Polish prosecutor will endeavor to show that he is the head of an international ring of diamond smugglers . Reports that none of the swallowers were suffering more than a minor gripe , caused physicians to recall that sizable nuts &; bolts , small spoons and open safety pins are not infrequently swallowed without fatality.
