Citizen Calvin Coolidge , in spite of himself , was back in the news last week . The New York Evening Post advertised and republished his article on national defense . The National Geographic Society elected him a director . And he went trout-fishing in Connecticut without a license . <P> The last was not as bad as it sounds . He caught 16 trout , weighing about 15 Ibs. , but he caught them in the privately-stocked preserve of onetime ( 1911-29 ) Senator George Payne McLean near Simsbury . Fishing without a license on a private preserve breaks no Connecticut law . And , anyway , the Connecticut Legislature , so soon as it heard what was going on , passed a special act empowering Governor Trumbull to issue special complimentary licenses to his prospective son-in-law 's father or any other distinguished guest who may drop into the State . With Citizen Coolidge in the news appeared a new figure-John Brukowski , 22 , dark of hair and eye , tight of lip . For several years John drove a car for Miss Ruth Cooper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . John was jobless when Citizen Coolidge returned to Northampton last month . Citizen Coolidge hired him as chauffeur and general handy man at $20 per week . Now John drives the dark Lincoln limousine , on the door of which can still be faintly discerned the outline of stars and an eagle which once composed the Presidential seal . At a proper discount , Citizen Coolidge bought his White House car from the U. S. and now stores it in a public garage at $15 per month .
