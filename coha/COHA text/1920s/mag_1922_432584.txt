Tim outstanding leader of the Indian masses in the last few troubled years has been Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , and of him I found the greatest differences of opinion . Is he politician , demagogue , or saint ? Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde ? Is he ' that lunatic ' as I heard a British general call him , or a seer comparable to Buddha or Confucius ? Is he ' that blackguard ' or a ' reincarnation of Vishnu , ' as I was repeatedly assured ? Is he ' filled with humility , ' or has attention made him ' vain of power ' ? To answer these questions , I read all I could find of his writings , and better still I went to see him . It was at Ahmadabad , during the late December meeting of the All-Indian Congress , that I first saw Gandhi . Mr. Amballal , a rich mill-owner , kindly arranged the meeting . In his car we drove to the Congress Hall , erected outside the walls of Ahmadabad , near the vast tent-city built to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curious square tents were built of slight wooden frames covered with Indian woven cotton cloth , or Khadi . The thousands of visitors had come as is the custom all over India in attending fairs or sacred festivals , literally taking up their beds and walking , at least to and from the railroad station . Their wants are few : a blanket , a bag of rice , a simple cooking utensil or two . If it is warm , they wear little but a loin cloth : if cold , they wrap their many-colored blankets around them . One missed the picturesque turban or other headdress , because all the faithful wore the Gandhi cap ? a homely white skull cap , hopelessly inartistic , but the token of submission to the will of the great ' Mahat-ma : As we neared the Congress Hall , with the giant spinning wheel before it , ? Gandhi 's device for whining economic independence , ? we met the thousands of delegates coming out . Everybody seemed to know Mr. Amballal , but they looked at me with curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent , ' was the answer to the questions of my Indian friend . We turned aside , worrying our way through numbers of tongas , autos , and pedestrians , and drove as near as we could get to Gandhi 's tent ; then walked through a narrow lane made by the ten thousand wildly enthusiastic Indians shouting : ' Mahatma Gandhi ki jai ! ' ( Victory for Gandhi , the holy man . ) I have seen many American crowds , madly shouting their admiration for Roosevelt , but never with greater devotion than that of these dusky-skinned masses . Knowing full well the race hatred with which Gandhi , willingly or not , had filled his disciples , and recalling the fate of an American in the recent Bombay riots , I hoped fervently that Mr. Amballal 's power was as great as it was reputed . There was no need to worry , for everybody looked at me merely with curiosity . At last we reached the simple tent reserved for the great leader . Following the old Indian custom , which all obeyed , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outerroom , we entered Gandhi 's own room , in which there was a spinning wheel , whereon the leader was used to spin as an example to his followers . Besides the rush matting , there were a pallet and two pillows on the floor , and three bricks at one side of the room . This was all the furniture . Soon we heard the voice of the crowd outside grow in volume , and going to the door we saw Gandhi , the saint , the seer , the reincarnation of Vishnu , drive up in a Ford car ! There flashed through my mind the memory of his fierce denunciation of machinery , and modern rapid locomotion . In a moment , the man who had aroused India 's spirit as no man , dead or alive , had ever done , stood before me , and I was being introduced . Except for a loin cloth and a narrow scarf , he was naked , wearing no sandals , no cap such as his disciples wear . He shook hands , his eyes cast down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was a small man , that every rib plainly showed , and that his whole physique was frail . When he looked up at me with a tired but kindly smile , I saw that he had lost the two upper front teeth . As he talked , I began to understand why C. F. Andrews ' loved him like a brother , ' and why the proud Brahman , S. Srinavasa Iyengar , spoke of him tenderly as my master . ' I understood why the Inspector of Police at Poona enjoyed nothing more than to talk with hint , though , as he laughingly added , ' I may have to arrest bins any day . ' Gandhi 's eyes were liquid , filled with a spiritual light , and there was a mildness , a sweetness of spirit , a compassion for one who could not see the light , who could only stand in the outer darkness of the materialistic world . I recalled what his friend Jayaker had told me of Gandhi 's ' selflessness , ' ? a word his admirers never omit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervor . Is America , he would be merely a curiosity . The long-haired men and the short-haired women would gather around him and console him because nobody appreciated him ; but in India , whose mystic soul is stirred by nothing as by religion , millions turn to him , swayed , I feel sure , much more by his religious appeal than by his political ideals . The Maharajah of Ahvar was more than half right , I believe , when he assured me : ' Mr. Gandhi is not of any influence , but Mahatma Gandhi is listened to because he is a holy man . ' If you and Gandhi and I , ' said His Highness , ' were to go to the gates of an Indian village , and determine by lot which would be announced as a ma.hatma , it would not make the least difference which of us got the title and went in . To the one with that title all would come , asking no questions , but accepting whatever he said without question . ' It is true that Gandhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahatma ; but his followers insist upon the title . Only by reviewing the political and social ideas of this new messiah can one understand the amazing miracle of his leadership . ' India , ' he says , ' is being ground down , not under the English heel but under that of modern civilization . ' ? ' There is no end to the victims destroyed in the fire of civilization . . it is like a mouse gnawing while it is soothing us . ' It is railways , lawyers , and doctors , he declares , that have impoverished India . ' But for the railways , the English could not have such a hold on India as they have . ' These railways have spread bubonic plague , he asserts , because they carry plague germs . ' Railways increase the frequency of famines , because , owing to facility of means of locomotion , people sell out their grain . . . become careless , and so the pressure of famine increases . ' He forgets that it is the rail- road which has enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst aspects , it has practically disappeared . He clinches his argument against railways by asserting : ' Good travels at a snail 's pace ? it can therefore have little to do with railways , . . . but evil has wings . ' ? ' God set a limit to a man 's locomotive ambition in the construction of his body . ' It is not the railroads alone , Gandhi teaches , but lawyers who have ' enslaved India . ' They will , ' as a rule , advance quarrels . ' ? ' They have made brothers enemies . ' ' Lazy people , in order to indulge in luxuries , take up such professions . ' If law pleaders were to abandon their profession and consider it just as degrading as prostitution , English rule would break up in a day . ' They have also used the medical profession , he declares , for holding us . ' Doctors have almost unhinged us . Sometimes I think that quacks are better than highly qualified doctors . ' Diseases arise by our own negligence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go to a doctor ; he gives me medicine ; I am cured ; I overeat again ; and I take his pills again . Had the doctor not intervened , nature would have done its work , and I would have acquired mastery over myself , would have been freed from vice . ' ? ' Hospitals are institutions for propagating sin . ' The Mahatma 's pure reason is never marred by facts . In one passage of Hind Swaraj , Gandhi bitterly attacks vivisection , and one seems to be listening to a voice from the Middle Ages . And what does Mr. Gandhi conclude from all this ? ' Those alone who have been affected by Western civilization have become enslaved . ' Get rid of it , and India is free . He believes the old civilization of India ' is not to be beaten in the world . Rome went , Greece shared the same fate , the might of the Pharaohs was broken , Japan became westernized ? . . but India is still sound at the foundation . ' He glories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of plough that existed thousands of years ago . ' Indeed , I can testify that , while traveling 5000 miles in India , going out frequently into the country districts , I never saw a modern plough , or a reaper and binder , or a threshing machine , or any agricultural implement not used by the sons of Abraham 5000 years ago . They reap with a sickle , and thresh with a flail that was old when Methuselah was a child . Perhaps nowhere else does the ancient world survive to the extent that it does in India ; and if this is a virtue , by all means give her the palm . Gandhi complacently decides that India ' has nothing to learn from anybody else , and this is as it should be . ' ? ' A nation with a constitution like this is fitter to teach others than to learn from others . ' Wherever in India the curse of modern civilization has not reached ( he has in mind the backward districts , as travel . ers describe them ) , India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . All Indians , by going back to the simple life , using the charka , or spinning wheel , to make their own simple Rhaddar cloth , giving up machines and English luxuries , may be free . ' It is swami self-rule when we learn to rule ourselves . ' Only our adoption of their civilization makes the British presence in India at all possible . Your hatred against them , ' Gandhi counsels his followers , ' ought to be transferred to their civilization . ' When they wish to resort to warfare , he asks them gently , ' Do you want to make the holy land of India unholy ? To arm India on a large scale is to Europeanize it . Do you not tremble to think of freeing India by assassination ? What we need to do is to kill ourselves . It is a cowardly thought , that of killing others . Those who are intoxicated by the wretched modern civilization think these things , ' He would therefore simply use ' love-force , soul-force , ' or passive resistance . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor of a great prov. , ince described to me how thirty thousand Indians in his capital city lay down on the street-railway track and stopped all traffic for two days . In desperation he at last ordered the chief of police to bring a company of dragoons into the city , select a place where the horsemen could be seen coming for several blocks , and then order to charge with lowered spears and come thundering down upon the prostrate Indians . He sat , in an agony of suspense , until word came by telephone that the passive resisters had broken and fled , clearing miles of the track . When Gandhi was asked how he would meet the wild Afghans if they were to swoop down out of the Northwest hills to ravage India when the British had left , he answered that he would meet them with ' soul-force ; Police-Inspector Griffith was discussing with Gandhi the punishment of criminals , which the reformer thought was all wrong . ' What would you do ? ' asked the Inspector . I would punish them as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fasted for a fortnight . ' But , ' said the Inspector , ' if you fast a fortnight for a lie , how long must I fast for a murderer ? Besides , there are 54 murders a year in this city . When would I get a chance to eat ? ' ' Oh ! now you ' re unreasonable and I ca n't argue with you , ' replied Gandhi , He would , therefore , resist evil by deliberate self-suffering , not deliberate injuring of the wrongdoer . In one of his famous interviews with the Viceroy , the Mahatma had argued against repressive measures , and urged soul-force , ' Can you tell me , ' queried Lord Reading , ' any example in history when government has successfully used soul-form ? ' After just a moment 's hesitation , Gandhi replied : Ali ! Your Excellency , but this is a new dispensation . ' Yet this ' Grand Old Fanatic , ' as one of his deepest admirers dubbed him to me , had a good English education , first in India , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bar in the Inner Temple . He speaks excellent English in a most eloquent way , though he is not at all oratorical , and is more likely to scold his audience than to tickle its vanities . With all his maddening unreason there is about him something fundamentally right-minded . He is quite right that Indians can not win swaraj by force . He is right in urging Brahmans to sit at the table with ' untouchables , ' and thus rid caste of one of its worst features . He has attacked fearlessly some of the worst evils of Hinduism . Whatever one may think of noncooperation and its danger , it has done much that Gandhi 's admirers claim for it . He has made the Indian people feel their unity as never before . He has awakened Indians from two hundred years of dreaming ' in slavery , ' ? as agitators love to call the British late benevolent absolutism , ? to a pride that will not tolerate assumed superiority . When , as I was leaving India , I heard of Gandhi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea , learned that he had been convicted and sent to prison for six years , I found that I had mingled feelings about it . I thought of Gandhi 's gentleness , his lovableness , the atmosphere of saintliness about him , the frail body always overtaxed and ever driven on by a high sense of duty . I recalled him ? simple , undefiled , living in the pure radiance of the spirit . These thoughts made me sad . But when I reasoned about it , I knew that , had I been Viceroy , I should have arrested Gandhi six months earlier ! I never could have had Lord Reading 's patience , or the courage to face the criticism of those who gnashed their teeth at his delays . I have only admiration for the wisdom and patience of the Viceroy , a liberal man , a strong , calm , and reasonable man , who wished nothing so much as to do right . Though keen in his intuitions , he is cautious in action . His critics say that he lacks firmness . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day as the hour seemed to demand , but waiting for a policy . He had two firm convictions : one , that civilized society rests on respect for law ? that was Gandhi 's Nemesis ; the other , that legal consideration ought not always to be uppermost in a statesman 's mind ? that was Gandhi 's hope . Gandhi 's persistence in civil disobedience compelled the Viceroy to act on his first conviction . I asked Sir Narayan Chandavarkar , President of the Bombay Legislative Council , and loyal supporter of the British Government , why it was that I could detect in him and other Indians , who bitterly criticized Gandhi 's methods , an underlying reverence for the man . ' It is , ' he replied , ' the religious appeal , the strongest of all emotions in an Indian . I , who gave up my Brahmin prerogatives that I might fight the battle for the depressed classes , and who have a reasoned hatred of idols , have felt the religious emotions well up within me when , even lately , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Millions of Indians believe Gandhi to be a reincarnation of Vishnu . " He will become a God , " they declare . ' It must not be forgotten that for the masses Gandhi is not merely what his own words and conduct would make him , but what his followers , good and bad , have told the most credulous people in the modern world to believe him to be . A most active extremist organization exploits this holy figure as its greatest asset . One finds Gandhi 's pictures for sale in every bazaar in India , often drawn in the midst of other sacred figures suggesting his close relation with the Hindu gods . It has been carried in chariots in the sacred processions so loved by the Hindu . Simple village folk , I have been told repeatedly on the best authority , pray to these pictures . They find the leaves of trees stamped with the Mahatma 's name ; and the cunning charlatan who did it sells the leaves to awe-struck worshipers . Ignorant peasants are told that , if they do not heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are promised that , when the Gandhi raj ( rule ) comes , they will have no land-tax to pay , no famine or scourge will appear in the land , and the Golden Age will come . The Mahatma himself frowns on all this ; but , fearful of injury to the whole cause , he finds it hard to control the fringe of cranks and of unprincipled rogues that follows any great movement . Gandhi finds consolation in his nobler followers , like Mr. Jayaker of Bombay , who , though a graduate of Oxford , rich and influential , dresses in swadeshi cloth and thrusts his bare feet into Indian slippers . I recall him , gentle as a dove , soft-spoken , with a mild , sad face , and a soul that glowed with enthusiasm over Hindu philosophy , Hindu art , Hindu literature . His culture and refinement , Iris gentleness and sweetness of nature are all devoted to admiration of Gandhi . So , too , S. Srinavasa Iyengar , who admitted to me that , at first , he had opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ' seen the light , ' and was ' filled with a strange happiness ' when he realized that its value was , not the trouble which the non- cooperators gave the British Government , but the unity and self-control which they acquired for Indians . ' We gain sauaraj day by day , ' he assured me with ecstasy , ' as we conquer ourselves and go to prison or give up luxuries or offices for the cause . ' ? ' We do n't hate the English , ' he declared , true to his master 's teaching ; ' we serenely ignore them . ' Nevertheless , the result of Gandhi 's noncooperation methods is the breeding of hate , as the riots at Bombay , Madras , and Chauri Chaura plainly revealed . In each it was Indians who chiefly suffered . Indians maltreated , killed , and burned each other ; but the attack was made by noncooperator upon those who seemed either to obey English-made law , or to favor the British Government . It was of little use for Gandhi to fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to threaten to go into exile in the Himalayas . In vain , he urged criminals to deliver themselves to the authorities and confess their crime . It sees to no purpose that he declared the Chauri Chaura tragedy ' a third warn-beg from God . ' So far as Government was concerned , Gandhi 's doctrines had led to these tragedies . He himself confessed at Ahmadabad : ' I have said times without number that saiyagraha insistence on truth admits of no violence , no pillage , no incendiarism ; and still , in the name of satyagraha , we burned down buildings , forcibly captured weapons , extorted money , stopped trains , cut off telegraph wires , killed innocent people , and plundered shops and private houses . If deeds such as those would have saved me from prison-house or scaffold , I should not like to be so saved . ' With all his fasting and SOI1011 , his is the ultimate responsibility . Ile had declared openly , in print , de ? liberately oppose Government , to the extent of trying to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . ' In Bombay , a wealthy Parsee gentleman came to take me for a ride in his car . As I stepped in , I saw a large six-shooter lying on the seat . With some embarrassment , my host put the weapon out of sight with the words , Mr. Gandhi has made that necessary . ' When that stage had been reached , it was time for Government to act . His imprisonment , strangely enough , has hardly caused a ripple . The Government of India Act would have had a better chance from the first , if it had not been for the unfortunate circumstances under which it was inaugurated . There were several untoward events . Immediately after the end of the World War , the Government of India , fearing that upon the passing of its war-powers would come Indian anarchy , with which it had no adequate powers to cope , pressed through its Council the Rowlett Acts . These acts gave the Government an extension of its war-powers for what seemed an adequate time . The acts , remained a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argumentative battle between the Indians and the British . Many Indians ptotested , and Gandhi began his campaign of passive resistance , using the favorite argument of a conscientious objector , which violates the basic principles of law and order as accepted by believers in our Western civilization . The first display of his power was a hartal at Delhi , later widely extended to other provinces . A hartal is often described as a strike , but it means more than that ; for , when it is successful , a whole city seems dead . All shops are closed , all activities cease , people re- main in their houses , with shutters down . It would be impossible in any land but India , where fear of public opinion is a dominant force . Aroused by this agitation , which went far beyond the actual demands of the occasion , the people of the Punjab were aroused to a frenzy in which they made a brutal attack upon an Englishwoman , murdered five Europeans in Amritzar , and created the impression in the minds of those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open rebellion ? that another Indian mutiny was imminent . The very British understanding of the Indian people led them , perhaps , to be too fearful . It is easy for one who is inexperienced to be misled by the customary docility and obedience to law that obtain among the Indian masses . The Western mind does not easily grasp the fact that these resigned and mild-mannered people can be stirred , by appeals to their ever-dominant religious fanaticism , to a high pitch of reckless fury . No lie can be too crude , no deceit too open , to draw them into insane violence unknown in present-day civilized lands . Out of this situation came the well-known ' Punjab affair , ' General Dyer 's folly , which cost nearly four hundred Indian lives . A ghastly blunder had been committed , for which only the most prompt repudiation by the Government could make the least amends . There was fatal delay , and when the Hunter Commission was appointed , it was too late to appease Indian opinion . It availed noticing that Dyer was retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last stigmatized his action as transgressing certain standards of conduct which no civilized government can with impunity neglect , and which His Majesty 's Government are determined to uphold . ' It was too late . The affair determined the hitherto wavering Gandhi . He had fasted for the violent sins of his followers , but now he denounced as satanic the conduct of the agents of the British Government . Until it should show a complete change of heart , Gandhi declared it a deadly sin for Indians to cooperate with it . In a word , an almost isolated instance of bad judgment and inhumanity by an individual was made to suffice as an indictment for a whole regime . True the British Government did not hasten to repudiate the action , but that only implicates a busy Viceroy and a British Cabinet harried by more world problems at the moment than has been the lot of any other government in history . English journals and members of Parliament denounced the affair without stint . With this ' Punjab wrong ' was linked the Khilafat wrong . ' After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the World War , in which the conduct of the Turks had aroused the moral indignation of the world , Moslem leaders began to arouse the Indian Mohammedans with the cry that Islam was endangered . It was urged that the capital of the Islamic world , Constantinople , had been seized by the Allies with British approval ; that the Khilafat was threatened , and that other Moslem holy places in Asia Minor had been - violated by the British , in spite of promises to the contrary , A fictitious importance was attached to it , and a vast amount of exaggeration was indulged in with respect to it . The Honorable Mr. Fazlul Haq said to me that some of his fellow Moslems had openly confessed to him that they did not care a brass anna for the Khilafat ; but the object of agitation and noncooperation campaigns was to pave the way for Revolution in India . ' It is certain that it was necessary in this case , as it was not in the Punjab case , to engage in a propaganda to arouse the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellious feelings . When they got excited , they all talked at once and , being foreign , to me seemed most alarming . I felt very strange and alone among those outlandish Oriental figures . I returned to my room more than once expecting all India to be in flames the next morning ; but awoke to find the dawn as serene as ever , and no news except of some isolated riot . The curious Oriental dress enhanced the alarming effect . Some about the council table wore only a loin cloth and a khaddar scarf . Others were in rich robes and handsome turbans . I recall one occasion , when I sat next to the son of a rajah , whose ancestral face must have been aristocratic from the days of Buddha . Opposite sat a dirty-robed , bare-footed , scowling Pathan , who looked as if he had just cut a throat and was enjoying the recollection of it . Some had caste-marks painted on their foreheads . Some were oily and fat , while others were thin , with fanatical faces . One of Gandhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founder of the true religion . ' All tried to impress me with the ineffable , sins of the British Government . The average extremist has only begun when he denounces the ' Punjab affair ' and the Khilafat wrongs . ' He declares that Government raises too heavy taxes , with which it pays lavish salaries to Englishmen , spends recklessly on the army , and burdens the people with a costly removal of the Government to the mountains during the hot season . Indians are not trained as army officers , and are given only the minor and ill-paid civil offices , the Nationalist asserts . Government allows Indians to be ill-treated in the British colonies , he affirms ; ' Being a foreign government , it is selfish and tyrannical . ' It has , cries the Gandhi disciple , made the people poor by draining India of its wealth . This brings in its train , one is told , famine more frequent and on a scale unknown before . Government has taken the Indian peasant 's land , the trade of the merchant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seeks to root out caste by polluting the sugar and salt that men eat , even the clothes that they wear . With its everlasting canals , roads , and railways , it has loosed malaria . It has even poisoned wells , I have been informed , and maliciously brought in the plague . All this was aimed at reducing the population , and making it easier to govern . One Bengal enthusiast sat , with his little Babu secretary by his side , and delivered to me in my Government House parlor an oration intended to demonstrate that the true cause of all Indian unrest was ? the Englishman 's fondness for beefsteak ! With statistics from the ' All-Indian Cow Conference , ' he showed that this led to killing too many cows , which reduced the draft animals , thus cutting down the acreage ploughed , and resulting in a smaller harvest , which left the Indian people half-starved and hence discontented ! I was appalled at the British heartlessness ; but I wondered why the beef eaten by seventy-seven millions of Mohammedans had so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From some noncofiperators I learned that the British had made no effort to educate the people ; but others complained that they had destroyed religion by their godless system of education . In short , cried C. R. Das to me , as we talked in his cell in Alipore jail , the British have enslaved a whole people who are now struggling to be free . Omitting the Khilafat matter and the Amritzar affair , which have been weighed above , I wish to say that , after a most dispassionate examination of these alleged wrongs , I must conclude that some of them , like the plague and malaria and beefsteak arraignments , are absurd , some are the results of advancing Western civilization , and the rest are based upon such temporary errors of judgment as all governments , are likely to commit , or upon unalterable conditions or stupendous facts before which any government would stand appalled . The Indian Government has to meet the needs of a modern state , with the slender resources of an Oriental community . Moreover , it has to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for plagues and badly managed monsoons , just as American administrations are blamed for bad harvests and the influenza . When all is duly considered , there is much truth in the British assertion : ' We have labored untiringly to reconcile Hindu and Moslem . Our schools and our railroads have shaken the exclusiveness of caste ; ancient privileges are disappearing before justice and reform laws ; by the universal spread of the English language , we have furnished all educated Indians with a common medium for exchanging their thoughts . We found India under an inefficient despotism and we banished it . ' At the Darbar in Delhi , the thought came to me that only the British rule made it possible for all the forty Indian princes to meet peacefully under one canopy . The only unity that India enjoys to-day is the gift of the British rule . It has beyond question brought India nearer to political competence and national unity than she would in all reason have been without it . With those who only carp at what England has done in India , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Sydney Smiths said , curse the solar system because under it has come all our woe . As for me , the marvel of British rule in India never ceased to appeal to my imagination . In Bombay , or Madras , or Calcutta , the British society , with its British statues , British churches , British conventions , and red postboxes , goes serenely on , as if there were no brown waves of humanity beating ever upon the shores of this island of English life . In India there is one ruler to two hundred thousand ruled . No wonder that Horace Walpole cried : The Romans were mere triflers to us . ' If the British should leave suddenly , without preparing the Indians through a long period to assume the burden of government , there might easily be realized the prophecy which a governor of one of the great Indian provinces made to me . ' There would at once be riot , murder , rapine , in the great cities , ' he said . ' All money-lenders would stop business , all stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks or a month , the Afghans would pour in from the Northwest , for pillage , plunder , and rapine . The Parsees would be wiped out of Bombay , the Marwari from Calcutta . Mohammedan would be arrayed against Hindu , Hindu against Moslem . Millions would pay the forfeit , anarchy would reign . ' The Resident at Baroda , Mr. Crump , told me of taking five or six Sikhs to Calcutta . On arrival , he gave them some money with the caution to behave themselves , have a good time , and report next day . When they appeared he asked , ' Well , how do you like Cal . cuttal ' One of them replied : ' It would be a great city to loot , and ten of us could do it , too . ' Thus the big , warlike Sikh of the Punjab looked upon the little , rather timid , Bengalee , whose alert mind brings him prosperity which his neighbor covets . It is this which the efficient British Government prevents . It is an alien government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if India is to have any foreign government , they would prefer the British to any other . ' Yes , even to your own , ' added one frank Nationalist . Many of the Indian leaders deny that there is any ground for the dire prophecy of evil days in store for a self-governed India . A merchant from Indore , complaining bitterly to me of the arrogance of the British in assuming to be better able to care for India 's political welfare than the Indians , cried passionately : ' Think of their assumption ! My people were highly civilized thousands of years ago , when your people and the English people were running about wild in the Teutoburg Forest . ' Yes , ' I replied ; ' but we have kept on running ever since , while yours have stood still . ' It was said with a smile , and he let it pass . I had heard the argument a hundred times in different forms . I shall never forget the Honorable G. S. Khaparde , of the Council of State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dining-room to the parlor , and fervidly discoursing on India 's past . Look at her , worshiping to-day the same gods , keeping to the same civilization , she had four thousand years ago . Babylonia , Assyria , Egypt , Greece , and Rome have passed away ; their gods , are no more ; their civilization is dead ; they area mere historical memory ; but India still worships at the old shrines and follows the old social customs , in spite of invading Greeks , Persians , Moguls , and British . And , like Cleopatra , " age can not wither nor custom stale her infinite variety . " ' Sir Surendranath Banerji declared that the ancient Hindus had been the spiritual teachers of the world . This mission has ceased to function , he sadly admitted . ' It must be set in motion again , that India may save mankind from the materialism and badly directed moral culture which led to the World War . ' It is customary for Indians to sneer at European civilization . The war exposed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their affairs as the statesmen of Europe ! They forget that British power rescued India from just such a scene of clashing races ; that thrones , dominations , princely ambitions , had for ages wrecked India before the British compelled peace . Does India stand in the forefront of barbarous nations , or in the vanguard of civilized nations ? I do n't know . But , if prevailing ideas in our Western world are right , India is not wholly civilized . India has a state of society , not savage exactly , but simple and destitute of comforts , beyond the conception of untraveled Americans . It is a society which has its simple pleasures , and a not unaffectionate family life . Its only outstanding civilized trait in Occidental eyes is its art creations along certain lines . In any native street , one sees beautifully carved columns , beams , lintels ; and in the temples and mosques of Northern India one sees architectural beauty unsurpassed by the classic or Gothic architecture . Yet all these lovely monuments of Indian art were being neglected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began his noble work of rescuing the decaying and neglected temples , mosques , and ancient forts . In a lifetime men do not tire of India 's myriad colors , its myriad forms . In dress alone , its people know an infinity of ways of exposing the charms of the human body . I have never before seen such artistic grouping of colored garments as a large crowd of Indians displays . Nor can one elsewhere see such a variety of faces as in an Indian crowd , from the ferocious long-haired Bheel , to the refined Christ-like Brahman . The streets of Bombay , with their hundreds of thousands of chattering , aimlessly moving human beings , doing a myriad of inexplicable things in the midst of sunlit , highly colored streets , are the most interesting of sights . Such squalor , such dirt , such incredible fanaticism , such bathing in vile , sacred pools , such mumbling of holy phrases , such fits of passion and such mild resignation , I never saw or want to see again . That the English have taught these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sanitation is greatly to their credit . I take a reverent attitude before the patience and devotion that has moved fanatical mountains . I have the greatest respect , and even admiration , for many cultured Indians I have met ; but my Occidental density renders me wholly unable to see the wonderful spiritual qualities which enthusiasts find in the lower classes of Indians . If I have correctly measured the attainments of Indian civilization , it will need generations of patient effort to raise it to a stage where more than four or five millions out of the three hundred and fifteen millions can intelligent y take part in their self-government . Moreover , there is the question whether India has men capable of assuming the burden of governing one fifth of the human race . The English say : Political responsibility is a thing few Indians will shoulder ; if they do , they grow weary soon , and allow self-interest and family interest to corrode it . ' I have had astounding cases of nepotism in Indian high officials absolutely proved to me . Many emphasize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the almost universal Indian respect for , and demand for , the Sahib 's administration . That the majority of Indians do not favor Indians in offices of trust , is a common saying in India , ' Many Indian officials have quick , destructive little minds , touchy , vain , polite , evasive , but not strong , confident , burden-taking minds , ' asserted a keen , liberal , and experienced Englishman . Perhaps this is a prejudiced , uncharitable view ; but when one talks with cultured Indians ? the best of them ? and appreciates the singular gentleness of soul which marks them , one wonders whether out of their number one could select s minister with backbone and guts ' ? one who will pull his weight and not be afraid of a racket , ' as an English friend expressed it . Nevertheless , I have never felt any doubt that experience would give them the sterner qualities . It is all a matter of being gradually accustomed to the burden . And one can never get out of one 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , any race that came down from the Northwestand conquered it , had the energy and spirit to build a civilization , effective government , architectural monuments , and all before the climate sapped its strength ; but when that time came , it fell before a new invasion from the North , which , in its turn , built a new civilization and awaited again its Nemesis . The British alone , coming to India by sea , returned as individuals to their home , and , like the giants of old , renewed their strength on that soil . In spite of historical ill-omen , however , the Indians have a very natural and proper ambition for self-government , with which every magnanimous person will sympathize ; but surely a mere ill-considered try for it , at the frightful cost of universal anarchy , in a country like India , would be ghastly folly . All prophecy as regards the political future of India is futile ; but I am convinced that , the British will work out some solution of their problems in that troubled land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A most lovable Scotch missionary , who entertained me at Poona and who went with me to a meeting of the Deccan Liberal Club there , came away shaking his head sadly , saying : ' The fire has been lighted , The flame will never go out . England has lost India . ' I do not now agree with him , though at the moment I did . The men who are really in power in India ? Lord Willingdon , Sir Harcourt Butler , Sir William Marris , Sir George Lloyd , and many others ? are right-minded ; they wish to do the right thing , and if the people at home , in England , will let them alone , keep their hands off , a wise solution will be found by those actually in India , who understand all the subtle influences , the unique conditions , and the almost morbid sensitiveness of the Oriental mind . It was unfortunate that the visit of the Prince of Wales focused English attention on India at a time when it was most important that there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new reforms were working . The rising tide of criticism in England , which swept Lord Montagu out of office , is bitterly resented by Nationalist leaders . The Indians are most sensitive to any indications that London means to put any obstacles in the path of their political advance under the new Act . Any suggestion that Parliament is saying : Oh , we did not mean to go as far as that when we gave India the new scheme , ' is maddening to men who think that they have not been given enough . The fall of Lord Montagu , who stood for the new era in the Indian mind , made more stir in India than the arrest of Gandhi ; for many interpreted that to mean reaction at Whitehall . Lord Curzon 's talk about ' a subordinate branch of the Imperial Government , six thousand miles away , ' and English criticism of the personnel of the Delhi Legislature , simply pour oil on the flames of Nationalism and race - feeling in India . This great imperial problem must be solved in India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England to arrest the movement of political opinion in India . In the present stage , the temper of that opinion is one of the vital factors ; and any attempt to reassert the control of the Imperial Parliament too obviously will have a bad effect .
