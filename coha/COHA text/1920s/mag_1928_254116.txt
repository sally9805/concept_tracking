THE SUN HAWK-Robert W. Chambers-Appleton ( $2.00 ) . For years Author Chambers has dominated the realm of high romance . His present flyleaf lists two columns of unaccountably sound-sellers , many of which have dealt with cloak and sword , picturesque oaths and spirited ladies . Louis XIV being his favorite monarch , he now weaves around this " Sun King 's " favorite hunting companion a somewhat laborious tale of French colonization in Quebec , complete with bloody Indian skirmishes and pious persecution of heretics . As for love interest , 8-year-old Countess Palladine , the sole survivor of a lurid Turkish massacre , is rescued thrillingly by a young English freelancer . Her gratitude very shortly develops into precocious passion , which brings her to him years later in the New World . Author Chambers bases his tale on contemporary chronicles.
