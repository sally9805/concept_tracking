txt Ambassador " of the Russian Soviet Government , testifying at Washington before the Senate subcommittee investigating Russian propaganda , on Jan. 30 , 1020 , filed a list of firms in the United States with which , he said , he had contracts- to supply goods to Russia as soon as the restoration of direct relations between the two countries made shipments Possible . One of these contracts was with the Lehigh Machine Coiiipa , ny of Pennsylvania for $4,500,000 worth of ) printing machinery . On the same day he testified that " all the money he got came out " of the Treasury of the Soviet Re " public . " Mr. EINIEP.SON P. JENNINGS of that company is also President of the American Commercial Association to Promote Trade With Russia . The members of that association are described as " hard-headed business men . " That is a highly ironical description so far as their dealings with the promissory Mr. MARTENS are concerned . They were so eager to do business with Russia that they neglected to find out what was a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was little to sell and little to buy anything with in Russia . Transportation was broken down ; even internal distribution , of goods was almost impossible . MARTENS was a Soviet propagandist . He was flattering the hard-headed business men with prospects of a mostly imaginary trade for the sake of inducing them to bring the United States to recognize the Soviet Government . Everybody not extraordinarily credulous and pining to be gulled knew that that Government " ' repudiates , " as Secretary COLBY said , " every principle of harmonious " and trustful relations , whether of " nations or individuals , and is based " upon negation of honor and good faith and every usage and conVen " tion underlying the structure of in " ternational law . " Both that Government and its emissary MARTENS can have deceived , it would seem , nobody who read the newspapers . Yet the hard-headed business men were easily bitten . They put'Up the money which . Mr. MARTENS used for propaganda purposes . Many of them spent a lot of time and money in Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Soviet magnates are " plain crooks , " says Mr. JENNINGS . He might have found that out a good deal more cheaply . Soon after he left this country for its good , MARTENS cheerfully stated that the American contracts had been canceled . Recognition - of their Government , a better chance to break down other Governments , is what the Soviet masters have been seeking . The so bepuffed trade is always small potatoes . The long discussed trade agreement which Mr. LLOYD GEORGE and Mr. KRA SSIN negotiated has brought no golden results . Not much but flax , which was brought in indirectly before the agreement , has been imported into England under it . Our own trade with Soviet Russia has greatly shrunken since 1919 and 1920 . For the - first six months of 1921 it amounted to some $13,000,000 , of which less than $700,000 was imports . Commercial , sentimental or political , the delusion about Soviet Russia is of the strangest . Before the ' eyes of all the world a great nation has been driven into utter disaster . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologists and their admirers in the United States ; and not among their fellow Communists and destructionists alone . So easy is it to divorce opinions from unpleasant facts .
