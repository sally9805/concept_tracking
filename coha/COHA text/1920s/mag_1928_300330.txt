Yandell Henderson , professor of applied physiology at Yale , was angry . Cause : anti-vivisectionists will introduce a bill at the coming short session of Congress to prohibit the use of animals for medical purposes or scientific investigations within the District of Columbia . Such District law would be a mean blow at medical research , for the states next would be induced to imitate its restrictions , with a Constitutional Amendment in prospect . <P> Angry because he must sneakily buy his dogs from scamps , because Connecticut 's law forces him to pay at least $5 for any sort of dog , most of all because he hates nonsensical restrictions , Professor Henderson wrote a letter ( printed last week ) to the American Medical Association . He urged the Association to hire shrewd lawyers to fight the anti-vivisectionists in the District of Columbia . He demanded that doctors no longer oppose such laws , as they have " in the past , merely by pious professions regarding all the good that science does . " They should initiate fore-fending bills " requiring that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . . . shall be at the disposal of medical schools , research institutes , and government bureaus that have use for dogs . . . . <P> " Such a bill would be analogous to the anatomic materials acts of many states . Medical schools obtain human bodies for dissection under such laws . Before there were such laws there were cases in which grave robbers were hired . "
