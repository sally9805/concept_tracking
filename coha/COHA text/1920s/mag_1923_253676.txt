Or Is There a " Literary Dictatorship " in New York ? <P> From time to time the charge has been repeated that American literature and drama is controlled by a semisecret cabal of radical young critics residing in New York , but the " exposure " has never been thorough . There were rumors ; there were hints ; but it remained for The Boston Post to analyze the critical dictatorship with a truly ruthless pen . <P> The Post asserts , as one speaking with authority , that the youthful intelligentsia , occupying strategic positions in the publicity section of the literary world as editors and contributors to the " highbrow " weeklies , critics of books and the drama , colyumists and readers for publishing houses , have combined to form not alone a mutual admiration society , but also an exclusive literary coterie , admission to which is denied candidates who have not the personal friendship of the charter members .

Or , better yet , the Bookman 's Day Book , written every Sunday by Burton Rascoe of The New York Tribune .
