Taking down stories over the telephone , coordinating them , revamping them , the rewrite man softly cursing the reporter for not getting more and better facts , is routine in every newspaper office . But last week the New York Telegram received a story by telephone which occasioned no cursing , which no one dared rewrite . <P> It began : " After one of the most unsuccessful trips to Europe on record , Louis Salazacheck , 20 , of 52 Jefferson St. , New York , tonight warned all would-be stowaways to stay away from the United <P> States Lines . " It went on to tell , in. seven more paragraphs , how Stowaway Salaza-check had been discovered aboard the Leviathan on her last eastern trip , clapped into Bargate Prison for two and one-half days , and shipped back again on the Leviathan . <P> As an inspiration for cub reporters it was not , perhaps , the greatest newspaper story ever written . But cub reporters on the Telegram and all other Scripps-Howard newspapers read it with special attention because it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> As a piece of news to startle the Telegram 's readers it was not , perhaps , the scoop-of-the-year . Yet the Telegram 's editor made haste to front-page it because he could truthfully call it " the first news story ever telephoned to a newspaper from a ship at sea . "
