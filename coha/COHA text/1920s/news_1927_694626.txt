txt FourUnited States Senators are the very much astonished beneficiaries , to the extent of $1,200,000 in dream currency , of a type of imaginative literature which has flourished mightily since the Armistice . While statesmen have been trying to forge a new world-order , humbler persons , modest to the point of anonymity , have been engaged in forging other things . An unprecedented international upheaval has produced , among other results , a vast population of expatriates and wanderers . They are , as a rule , innocent and hapless refugees , but among them inevitably are many dubious birds-of-passage for whom the world 's troubles have been a world market . It is a rare nation that has not complained since Serajevo , and with more or less reason , against this doubtful form of commercial paper . Soviet Russia regards herself as the chief victim , though she has not pressed hard her first formal denial of the authenticity of the recent documents in the tussian Legation at Peking , and has by no means established the falsity of the famous Zinoviev letter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts some time ago found a verdict of guilty against mistaken " patriots " who set out to redeem their country by forging French banknotes . There are rumors of a late abortive Ukrainian plot for the wholesale counterfeiting of Soviet money . There is even talk of a " master-mind " behind all these post-war manifestations , moving from country to country and from continent to continent with the fluctuations of the market for such wares . The trade is an ancient one . For modern times the outstanding example would still be the Pigott letters fathered upon CHARLES STEW ART PARNELL . The great mass of current experiment in this field of belleslettres departs from the pure classic of the Pigott type in not manufacturing their results out of the whole paper . The idea is to start with a solid nucleus in the form of a genuine and innocent document and then to elaborate . Sometimes the genuine innocent document is retouched . The lawyers have a maxim about false in one thing false in everything . But popular sentiment since the war , 1 suspicious , nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A touch of authenticity here and there is held to establish legitimacy , or at least the presumption of legitimacy , for an entire dossier of " documents . " To be fair , that is only the first reaction . Sober second thought , the spirit of fair play , asserts itself , and the stupid experiments in international mischief usually end up at their real market value . The psychology of the men engaged in the traffic may vary from case to case and may now and then be exceedingly complicated in the same person . Most of the merchandisers are just rascals . But now and then we encounter a queer mentality which does persuade itself that it is avenging the Hungarian fatherland while lining its own pockets by forging French banknotes . It is a state of mind best exemplified in the related field of espionage where a. man will sometimes serve two Oppc : : ite masters in something like a duality of spirit . Here the great modern example is the famous AZEFF of twenty-five years ago , who was at the same time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Czar 's secret police .
