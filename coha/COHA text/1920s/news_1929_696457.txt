Steel ! and General Electric , and resulted in sweeping gains in a long list of representative utility issues . While the firmer tone of the demand loan market was followed by substantial liquidation in many sections of the industrial list in the afternoon , it appeared evident that the selling was due as much to technical conditions in the market itself as to the money furry . After the prolonged advance since early June . the market stood in need of inside correction , and the credit developments furnished a pretext to bring it about . In important banking circles there was no real concern over the credit supply . It is considered virtually certain that the Federal lteserve authorities will conic to the relief of the money situation in the next few weeks with important purchases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed this policy in the past , and continuation of such a procedure appears more likely this year in view of the low levels to which the system 's holdings of bills and government obligations have been allowed to fall . ? ? ? As a matter of fact , the development of unseasonably high rates for credit at this time affords further evidence of the nation 's extraor- dinary business activity Instead of declining through the summer months , as has been customary in the past , commercial loans have been sicres-sing steadily since early May . As of July 17 they stood at $9.248.000,000 , the highest level ever recorded at this season This unusual expansion has undoubtedly reflected the fact that no summer recession has occurred in g.eneral business , and indicated that extensive preparations were under way for autumn activities .
