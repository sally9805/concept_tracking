Bad enough it was , thought Mrs. Irene Smith , Livingston , N. J. , mother of seven , to be divorced for adultery . But when her onetime husband , a Milburn , N. J. , policeman , refused to support her youngest child because he believed the divorce corespondent , one August Schildknecht , was its father , Mrs. Smith protested . <P> She had heard that there were blood tests to decide putative paternality . Her information was imperfect . There are four kinds of human blood , called in medicine Groups I , II , III , IV . Only if a child 's blood differs from that of both its parents ' , is it probable that the man is not the father , and possible that the woman is not the mother . Resemblances can not be conclusive . <P> Nonetheless Mrs. Smith last week cried to court for blood tests . They were permitted , and the two men , the mother and the child each gave up a few drops of their blood . It was with quite different emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same type , that the point at issue could have no medical proof . <P> That there are four different types of human blood has another , and far greater significance in medicine . For blood transfusions bloods must not be antagonistic . Blood group IV in emergency may be used for any transfusion . It has general characteristics . People of the other three groups can furnish their blood only to patients of their own type . <P> Technique of blood transfusion has enabled many an individual to help a sick or injured friend . It has also created a traffic in blood . Blood brokers organize professional donors and supply them to hospitals . The friendless patient pays $50 a pint for blood . Brokers exact 20% of that as commission . Manhattan has about 2,000 donors , half of them professionals , half occasionals ( impoverished people , thrill seekers ) . One Thomas Kane , deckhand , after giving blood 100 times in 15 years , ' ' retired ' ' last week . He boasts himself the record holder and now considers selling patches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Gardiner , has sold his blood 73 times in nine years . Shrewd , he has assembled a gang of 300 robust Bowery down- &-outs,; dock-wallopers , truck drivers and chauffeurs whose blood he sells to New York hospitals . Outdoor workers serve best . <P> Such commercial traffic has dangers . It can not be closely supervised . Many a blood seller is diseased , many a one sells too often . It takes four to five weeks for such to replace their lost blood properly to provide for another transfusion . A doctor sometimes needs a donor in a hurry and has no time to make thorough blood tests and counts . He must rely on a seller 's word , and many a man who will sell blood for a living will tell lies . <P> In an attempt to put the commercial blood brokers out of business , the New York Academy of Medicine , County Medical Society and Health Department recently gave their joint blessing to an Association for the Transfusion of Blood in Aid of Suffering . This organization is semi-commercial , quasi eleemosynary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gives its selected sellers $45 , keeps $5 for commission . It is under reliable medical control .
