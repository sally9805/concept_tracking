txt It is announced in Washington that President HARDING has canceled all his speaking engagements for the next six weeks and will make no others . He finds that his executive duties will demand all his time and strength . In addition , he is the titular leader of his party , and It is his party that is calling upon him for help . The theory upon which it has been proceeding since March 4 has broken down . There was to be a fellowship of kindred minds  --  leading minds , of course . There was to be a display of collective wisdom before which every difficulty would vanish . It was to be no longer a question of one-man government , since all men were to co-operate in making the public business march . A " benediction of understanding " and large doses . of sweet reasonableness were to make initiative , direction , energy and the driving power of party control in the White House wholly unnecessary . Now a change has come over the spirit of that dream . The party managers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  taxation , economy , the tariff  --  have scarcely been touched , and the more they are touched the more they seem to be muddled . Complaints are coming in from the country . Who is going to bring decision out of a Congress unable to agree ? Who is to lead , if the leaders will not or can not ? All the answers point to the President . Something like a general demand is making itself heard that he try to bring order out of chaos and give to his party a firm guidance which it is conscious of lacking . If this means that Mr. HARDING must again imitate Mr. WILSON , that is today no objection in the minds of worried Republicans . They need some one to pull them out of the slough , and the President is clearly indicated as the one to do it . These developments remind us how hard it is to take away from an office power once given to it . For two decades Americans have been witnessing a steady heightening , of the Presidency , and an extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President WILsoN still farther . The present Administration came into office amid predictions that the Republicans were going to " change all that . " They have tried to do it , but now we see them turning again to the President as the leader of his troubled party and the judge and divider over a vacillating and discordant Congress . The task which it is proposed to lay upon Mr. HARDING 's shoulders is greater than at first sight appears . He is called upon to compose factions in his party and to clean up the legislative blockade . But behind all this is a more arduous labor . It is that of satisfying the country , of stilling ominous complaints , of trying to carry out promises rashly made . The situation in which the Republican Party finds itself today is not unlike that which confronted the English politicians who combined to overthrow WALPOLE . MACAULAY 'S description of their plight reads almost as if it were written to fit the posture of affairs in Washington at the present time : It was impossible to follow any line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the successful party . It was impossible to find places for a tenth part of those who thought they had a right to office . While the parliamentary leaders were preaching patience and confidence , while their followers were clamoring for reward , a still louder voice was heard from without , the terrible cry of a people angry , they hardly knew with whom , and impatient , they hardly knew for what . The day of retribution had arrived . The Opposition reaped that which they had sown . Inflamed with hatred and cupidity , despairing of success by an ordinary mode of political warfare , and blind to consequences which . though remote , were certain , they had conjured up a devil whom they could not lay . They had made the public mind drunk with calumny and declamation . They had raised expectations which it was impossible to satisfy . This is the deep , and fundamental difficulty . In reply to his party followers who are now begging the Presidentto , save them , ' " fie might well ask : " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him is severe and seemingly inipossible . ' No wonder that he has resolved to - scbrri delights and live laborious days .
