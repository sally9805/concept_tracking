F ORTY years ago an antique , By W except for a very small num- PRICHAI ber of people , was any old junk which was n't in the current style . During the now ridiculed 189o 's ( actually a stirring and important period ) a renaissance of taste began and an antique speedily became something manufactured for household use or ornament before , say , 181o ; i. e. , in the style of the Colonies or the early Republic . Today , so widely has the craze for antiques spread , so great is the demand , that an antique seems once more to be any old junk not in the current styles . They even call hideous pressed glass made as late as 1885 antique ! The first Do n't of antique collecting is this : " Do n't consider anything an antique which does not date back a hundred years or more . If you follow this rule you will be in much less danger of gathering in a lot of intrinsically worthless junk . I do not mean that everything made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) after  | the i8zo 's was junk . But , alas ! artistically most of it was . It was hideous . First a degenerate style , and then machine processes of manufacture , swept over the Western World . Unless a person is collecting to illustrate historic periods , or from sentimental or commercial motives , he had best leave the last three quarters of the nineteenth century alone . That is the period of black walnut furniture , black marble fireplaces , Currier and Ives lithographs and so-called " Sandwich " glass . Currier and Ives lithographs and " Sandwich " glass are both widely collected today as antiques and often bring high prices . In nearly all instances , however , they are artistically worse than useless ? they are positively hideous , as hideous as another much-sought mid-century product Bennington dogs . What is the use of spending good money on such junk unless you desire to illustrate how our forefathers lived prior to the Civil War ? If you want to collect antiques , however , in order to surround yourself in your home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , stick to the periods before 182. o . And here comes a Do of antique collecting : Do collect what is intrinsically beautiful , what is artistic as well as historical . Unless you are equipping an historical exhibition there is no other real reason for collecting . For the price of a Currier and Ives lithograph you can get three or four modern lithographs fifty times as well printed , and a hundred times as well drawn . " Sandwich " glass is now reproduced and can be bought in the five-and-tencent stores if you feel you must have it . Indeed , it is often bought there and then resold to you as an " antique " ! But no hardware store , try as it may , can reproduce the hand-wrought latches and hinges on many an old farmhouse door and shutter ; nor can your carpenter with his modern universal plane reproduce the delicate irregularities of the fluting on an old pine corner cupboard ; and when it comes to such an aristocrat of the household as a highboy , where style and proportion count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite strikes the authentic note . Do collect what is intrinsically beautiful , unique and permanently valuable . Do n't collect junk just because it happens to be a current fad . Currier and Ives prints , Bennington dogs , " Sandwich " glass , American bottles , may all have a sentimental or historical interest ; but they are junk , nevertheless . Leave them alone , at any rate until you have surrounded yourself with beautiful things of real artistic worth . Perhaps the first specific Do of antique collecting in America , from my point of view , would be , Do collect mahogany furniture and the  | trim which goes with it . The latter , of course , is difficult and expensive to collect for most people . You have to be around where fine old houses are being wrecked , and you have to store the moldings , panels , etc. , somewhere till you can use them in a house of your own . But nothing can serve as the base and setting of an antique collection so well as authentic old woodwork , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes for the chance to purchase an old mantel frame , a door , a twentyfour-inch-wide pine panel , a strip of molding , even old pine boards , and so on . My own diningroom is entirely walled with old panels gathered over a wide stretch of country , and the mantel came from a house that was falling into ruin . I say , also , to collect first of all mahogany furniture , for the simple reason that in its day ? the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries ? this furniture was the best made , both in design and in workmanship . Mahogany was then the aristocrat of furniture wood , as it still is , for that matter . It was the wood of Chippendale and Sheraton , and in America of Savery and Duncan Phyfe . Why not start with the best ? Our ancestors did n't put Windsor chairs and pine tables , nor even maple furniture , in their parlors ? not when they could afford anything better . They used mahogany . We are paying a dubious compliment to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table into a shrieking yellow color and stick . it beside the Steinway , largely because it is " early American pine " and the dealer soaked us $150 for it . It remains a kitchen table just the same . Do n't , in other words , assume that just because a thing is a hundred or two hundred years old its intrinsic nature has been changed . If it was a rough , simple piece for a farm kitchen it still is ! Very early American furniture ? i. e. , of the seventeenth century ? is rare and therefore expensive . It is rare now because it was rare then . The early settlers lived very simply , and it was some time before they could afford either to import much furniture from England or take time to make it here . A genuine Carver chair ( like that in the Pilgrim Museum at Plymouth ) is worth many hundreds of dollars . An authentic Connecticut chest , so called ? an oak chest , often with panels and split-spindle decorations ? is also worth a large sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items from the seventeenth century are simple and solid in construction , of enduring materials , and by their very survival down the years tell a story of our rugged pioneer past . They have the beauty , too , of very aged  | oak and almost medieval lines . Especially if you are the happy possessor of a really old house , a pre-Revolutionary War house , I can think of few things more satisfactory to collect than a Connecticut or Hadley chest , a Carver or similar seventeenth-century chair , an old dresser for the kitchen and some turned wooden pitchers , with a few pewter plates and other domestic utensils . All the Currier and Ives prints , all the " Sandwich " glass in America , will not give you the enduring satisfaction you will find in a Connecticut chest of 1670 or , for your more aesthetic moods , a fine cherry ( if you ca n't find nor afford mahogany ) highboy of 1770 . There was nothing our ancestors admired more than porcelain ? or " China ware . " During the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was possessed only by the rich , but in the eighteenth century the secret of porcelain was discovered in Europe , and thereafter much beautiful porcelain was made in Germany , France and England . Also pottery was greatly improved , and Wedgwood and the Staffordshire potter turned out fine ware in England . The Staffordshire " blue ware , " with printed designs , often pictures of actual places , was made in quantities for the American trade well into the nineteenth century . At the same time the so-called " Lowestoft " china ( really made in China , with designs upon it often furnished by English or American customers ) was brought to Europe and America by the shipload . Do collect some of this old china and pottery . It has color , usefulness , charm , fitness . It goes with an old house or a new one . Old Chelsea or Crown Derby china , ornamented with gay flowers and honey-gold bands , is a lovely thing . The slightly " greasy " texture and bluish color of Lowestoft china and the characteristic red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early Staffordshire plate or platter is charming and you Do n't need to worry about what the design is . Pick up the casual plate for its color note and let the more specialized collectors pay their higher prices for the one which bears a picture , say , of Harvard Hall in Cambridge .  | Do n't collect American glass ? not , at any rate , until you have gathered around you objects of greater artistic worth and can then afford to turn your attention to a very highly specialized hobby wherein you need much knowledge to escape being swindled and wherein the objects collected are of small intrinsic value ? like postage stamps . Certain postage stamps cost as much as a painting by a fine artist ; but that does n't mean that they have any value as art . Certain pieces of early American glass ? Wistarberg or Stiegel ? cost large sums , also . But , alas ! that does n't mean they are intrinsically worth it . The truth is , most American glass was a second-rate imitation of European glass or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressed glass referred to . Collecting it is either a fad or the job of museums . The ordinary person wishing to collect something from the past of real beauty and artistic value would far better stick to china and pottery , in which his own instinct for what is attractive will be a fairly serviceable guide . Do n't , however , begin paying high prices for specialized Lowestoft designs and for eighteenth-century English china till you have studied the subject and know your way about . There are too many unscrupulous dealers . There are many pleasant byways of antique collecting which have less to do with art and more with the history of manners , with sentiment . Each person will follow his own inclination in picking these byways . But nearly all of them offer a good deal of pleasure . Old silver , of course , is not one of them , because old silver is an art product , of constantly increasing value . I mean such things as samplers , bandboxes , portrait silhouettes ( cut out of black paper and an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . In an old house in Plymouth is a collection of eighteenthcentury dolls which is altogether delightful . Many of the dolls are costume plates of the period , of course , and have a real historical value . Ancient samplers , generally worked by small girls , make attractive wall  | decorations in such houses as are old enough to comport with them . Old hooked rugs also go well in simple old houses but do not go well on modern oak floors and should not be collected unless you have a proper place to put them . Do n't collect things which you can not exhibit in fitting surroundings and Do n't collect things unless they also have some inherent charm . If they are actually ugly , no matter how historic , save them if you like for a museum or in your attic but do n't try to furnish your house with them . I am , however , omitting the most important Do of all and putting the cart before the horse . The most important Do of all in antique collecting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; learn something about fair current prices ( not the often-inflated auctionroom prices ) and , still more , learn to discriminate between what is good and what is only commonplace in workmanship and design . Learn to detect what the collector calls " style " in a chair or table or piece of hardware . If you Do n't thus equip yourself in advance you will waste much money and gather in a lot of second-rate material to clutter your house before experience teaches you what to buy . Do n't think that you know all about antiques because you subscribe to a magazine about them and have been to three country auctions ! There is , of course , no royal road to knowledge in the antique game , any more than in any other . But from the experience of a good many experts I am convinced that the very best way to acquire a flair for style , a sense of what is excellent in design and workmanship and also to avoid being taken in by avaricious dealers is to handle good examples yourself all you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take a well-made and well-designed Windsor chair , containing the authentic wood but covered with three or four layers of paint , for a very simple starter . Get some paint remover and go at it . After getting all the paint off you can with the chemical , use a scraper to clean it down thoroughly . In the process you will get the " feel " of the various woods used in this chair ? probably maple for the legs , pine for the seat , hickory for the spindles and hickory or ash for the arch of the back . You will also learn to tell a whittled spindle from a turned one , and as you handle the chair and view it from every angle you will get an intimate sense of its design and come to know whether the rake of the legs is good or not . Take , again , an old maple rope bed and clean that up ready for use . Then go at once to some furniture store and look at a modern reproduction of a similar bed . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in turning between the posts , some of them perhaps unnoticeable to the eye . One acorn top , perhaps , will feel a shade fatter to your palm as you polish it . But the reproduction will have four posts mechanically turned , as interchangeable as the parts of a flivver . Or " do over " an old bureau or chest of drawers and note the happy-go-lucky dovetailing which , however , always comes together right , the kind of woods used for the backing , the style of the crown molding under the top and similar details . After ascertaining what each kind of wood is use your thumbnail on the back of it , both with and across the grain , and rub it with your fingers , also , in order that you may know how it reacts to such pressure and how it feels . Also , scrape off a little section to remove all dirt and surface decay and get a good picture of what the grain looks like and the color . Note the difference in color between old pine and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many people , for instance , are surprised to learn that old mahogany , if it has not been stained , is n't red but brown ? almost the color of wine . A great deal of modern " mahogany " is good , honest birch with a red stain slapped into it . Finally , Do n't neglect any opportunity to see and study good antiques in museums and other collections ? in such places as the Peabody Museum in Salem , for example ; the Pendleton collection , Providence ; the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and the Van Cortlandt Manor House , New York . Here you will see absolutely authentic antiques of the best obtainable designs exhibited in settings appropriate to them and learn , as it were , what to aim for . I can imagine no single thing more valuable to the wouldbe collector than to stand for fifteen minutes before a William Savery highboy , just absorbing the proportions , the elegant , tall dignity of it , the grace of the cabriole legs , the richness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mahogany . Such a piece of furniture shows us how much style the eighteenth century had , how much our ancestors enjoyed the beauty of design and proportion . And , consequently , it increases our interest and ability to look for style , for the beauty of design and proportion , in the  | antiques we have the good fortune to collect . And Do n't think that these qualities are only to be found in mahogany highboys and other pieces perhaps beyond your means . They often exist in a cobra hinge on a barn door , forged by some village blacksmith , or in the graceful curve of a " goose neck " andiron or in the cabriole legs of a simple pine or maple table , or the sawedout design on the top of a banister-back chair , or in the design of the wings on a butterfly table , or in a hundred places where the ancient craftsmen found a chance to express the style of their age , their sense of beauty and fitness , even though their materials were humble . Do be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty and fitness , this style of the elder days of hand craftsmanship . Once you have developed your own eye to detect it nothing less will really satisfy you and you need never go very far wrong in your collecting if you Do collect what you like and admire ? and let the fads of the hour go and come as the wind listeth . Do n't pay any attention to them .  |
