txt Mystery and some doubt still surrounded last night the message , reporting something wrong , picked up by the Sable Island Radio Station and believed to be from Mrs. Frances W. Grayson and her crew of three aboard the amphibian plane Dawn , which passed over Cape Cod shortly after 7 o'clock last Friday night , two hours after it took off from Roosevelt Field . On Sunday night the message sent to The Associated Press from Halifax said the Sable Island Station had heard the Dawn at " 9:45 P. M. " but did not say on what evening . Later The Associated Press got a report that it was Friday evening that the message had been picked up , but yesterday , after communicating further with Halifax and Sable Island , it said the Dawn had been heard Sunday night instead of Friday . Sable Island 's Report . The radio station on Sable Island in a message to The Associated Press yesterday said : " Nine forty-five P. M. yesterday heard very high pitch swinging ICW ( interrupted continuous wave ) note saying something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rest of it but three last letters of last word " NCE . " Signed WMU . Signals were of fair strength and might have been judged to be between eighty or hundred miles . Several ships listened for her signals but no report of any kind received yet . " The belief that the message was sent on Friday was based on the fact that the plane would have been nearing Sable Island about that time , but that raised the question of why such a message had been delayed fortyeight hours in transit . Acceptance of the statement that the message came through Sunday night raised questions as to where the plane could have been at that hour and how its radio set was being operated . The message stated that Brice Goldsborough , the radio operator on the plane , had been sending I. C. W. , or interrupted continuous wave , which means that the operator was using his large set , power for which is derived from a wind generator placed in the slip stream of the propeller from the starboard engine . This indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A. D. Cardwell built and installed two radio sets on the plane . One was that the ship was still in the air when the message was sent , the other that if it was down on the water the starboard engine was still running and at a speed high enough to drive the wind generator from which the larger set on the plane was operated . Fliers Here Pessimistic . " No operator could possibly mistake the call , " Mr. Morehouse declared . " If it came ICW on Sunday night , then the mystery is still deeper . The Dawn carried only enough fuel for twenty hours , and that fuel would have been gone shortly after noon on Saturday . " Another thing , if the plane had come down in a sheltered spot along the coast of Nova Scotia within radio distance of Sable Island , why have not other stations or ships picked up the same message end what caused it to be broken off ? It is only with that starboard engine running that Goldsborough could have sent out his call ICW . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a radius of . only forty miles , but if this had been used it is hardly likely that the Sable Island operator would have reported that the message came ICW . " If Goldsborough was sending out his call on the small set Sunday night , " Mr. Morehouse pointed out , " then the Dawn was somewhere on the ocean within forty or fifty miles of Sable Island . " Efforts were being made late last night to obtain added details from Sable Island , as well as the complete text of Goldsborough 's message , if indeed it came from him . Fliers familiar with amphibian planes at Curtiss Field and naval officers were frankly pessimistic last night , even while they were hastening preparations for a search and possible rescue , that the Dawn and its occupants would ever be found unless they had made a landing inland or in a sheltered bay . A report from the Weather Bureau increased this feeling among those ' who have faced storm and cold in planes and small boats . Late on Friday there were scattered storms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the path that the Dawn should have followed over the ocean . A temperature of 36 degrees at the surface , which means freezing or lower at 1,000 feet up , prevailed and these conditions were the worst possible for and the source of the biggest danger that fliers fear at this time of year  --  that of ice forming on the wings . Snow , heavy mist , rain and sleet in weather close to freezing are almost certain to bring about this condition . It is not the weight of the ice , but the fact that it destroys the flying efficiency by changing the contour of the wing that causes trouble , and causes it quickly . A few minutes of this would send a plane down into the water , possibly in a spin . The fact that the message from the plane was not an S 0 S call , as far as could be learned , indicated to fliers here that the plane was still flying but having trouble . Then no more messages came . Could n't Last Long on Water . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angry waters of the North Atlantic , though sturdily built , it was felt here that it could not stand the beating of the waves for long . With prevailing west winds capable of sending the craft along at four or five miles an hour , the Dawn , if still afloat , was probably two hundred miles east of her course late last night . " Either a spin or a hard , flat landing was what happened , " one flier said last night . " Omdal might have been trying to land on one of those long rollers and when he came down the roller was n't there . He squashed the ship down flat . Then another roller came along and went over them . That was a good amphibian , but no boat with an eight-inch freeboard can take that stuff and last long . " Friend of Omdal Losing Hope . Relatives of Lieutenant Oskar Omdal , pilot of the Dawn , were more pessimistic . Nils Hansen , his cousin , with whom he had made his home since he came to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he was cheered somewhat by the news that the Los Angeles had gone out to search for the plane and its occupants . " I have n't given up all hope , " he said at his home , at 647 Forty-seventh Street , in Bay Ridge , " but I am afraid if they are not heard from by tomorrow all hope will be gone . " A man , and even a woman , can live three or four days in any kind of wilderness if any one in the party knows just what to do . Lieutenant Omdal could lead them out of it . He has been in tight places before . It gets tough around the fifth day , though . If they are all safe they should be heard from by tomorrow . After that ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " I think it is a wonderful thing to send the Los Angeles out , but if they landed on the water I would n't be so optimistic . I only hope their landed on shore . " Mr. Hansen did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Canadian radio station had picked up a message from the Dawn . " Oskar never spoke much about tha radio . " he said . " He did n't seem to think so much of it . He said it was always the first thing to go out of order when anything happened to a plane . " Danger in the Cold . Naval officers said they believed the greatest danger to the occupants of the Dawn would be that of freezing . They recalled that several years ago a plane was forced down , rode the waves gallantly and weatherel the storm , but the occupants were found frozen to death . The weather since the plane took off last Friday has been unsettled in the area between Cape Cod and Sable Island . Friday night , when the plane should have been flying toward its goal , there were snowstorms and some variable winds , though the prevailing winds were westerly and northerly . The cold was not bitter , for the time of year . There was a storm on the southern coast of Newfoundland , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported clear at Harbor Grace . On Saturday another low pressure area was centred over Nova Scotia , with storm conditions at Sydney , and on Sunday this condition was moving out to sea toward Sable Island , making high seas . Yesterday the centre of the storm area lay between Nova Scotia and Sable Island . Prevailing winds were northerly and westerly and the seas were high . It is through weather like this that the Los Angeles must fly today , and over these stormy seas destroyers and other craft will plow , their lookouts scanning the waters on every side for the yellow wing and squat hull of the Dawn . Mrs. Goldsborough Keeps Up Heart . While fliers and others who know the sea in Winter were expressing , their fears , Mrs. Brice Goldsborough and her son , Frank , were accepting every cheering word . " The plane was so well equipped and nay husband and Lieutenant Omdal knew so much and had worked so hard on the expedition that I feel they must have found a way to save themselves , " Mrs. Goldsborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad wo n't come home and we are refusing to be downhearted.
