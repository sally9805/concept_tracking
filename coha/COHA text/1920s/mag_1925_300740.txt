Last week the members of the New York Stock Exchange killed by an overwhelming vote a proposal of the governing board to increase the exchange membership from 1,100 to 1,125 ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) . Out of a total of 941 votes cast , only 268 favored the measure . The reason was not far to seek . At present every exchange member knows that his " seat " is worth in excess of $130,000 . Should more seats be added , the laws of supply and demand would function to lower that value . No exchange member wishes his " equity " to be affected . Therefore the present excessively heavy movements in securities on the exchange ( TIME , Oct. 26 , et seq ) will continue to take place without an increase in the number of the opulently seated . The Governing Board 's proposal was the first of its kind in 44 years .
