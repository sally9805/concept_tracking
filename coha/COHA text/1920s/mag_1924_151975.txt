QUEEN CALAFIA-Vicente Blasco Ibanez-Button ( $2.00 ) . Ibanez has had excellent motion pictures made from at least two of his romances . The shadow of the silver screen is never lifted from this one . The plot is based on the legend of an Amazonian queen who loved her bitterest foe . In modern Madrid , Conchita Douglas , a woman of spectacular proportions who did not hesitate to demolish bare-handed a sinewy gentleman who caused her annoyance , fell in love with the son of an old enemy . Realizing that she was too old for him , she resolved to sacrifice herself , told him ( falsely ) that she was his mother , and projected him disinterestedly into the arms of young and charming Consuelito . The whole is a swift , colorful story , roaming over several continents and not very relevantly embodying most of the early history of California . It ought to be better in the pictures .
