Peter Bernard Kyne was born in California , but that has not kept him from showing in much of his talk and especially in his bright gray eyes that he is chiefly Celt . His stories of personal experience are many of them quite as dramatic as his novels-that 's a gift these Irishmen have ! Mr. Kyne wrote his first story at 13 , was a soldier in the Spanish War , engaged in the lumber business and failed at it , tried to start a newspaper and failed at it , then turned to writing and has been more successful at it than most of his fellow " best-sellers . " That fact that The Go-Getter* and its doctrine have made him a good-salesman trade-mark irks him occasionally , for he says that he is forever talking to Rotary Clubs and young men 's organizations on the gospel of success . Why not ? He has the recipe . <P> " The author does much to his public , " he said the other day . ' ' He has n't any right to give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must keep faith with them and do his best to see that his work never bores them . That is the writer 's unforgiveable sin . " <P> Mr. Kyne 's latest novel is The Enchanted Hill + . He will do a series of travel articles about his recent trip around the world before he attempts an-other long story . Meanwhile , he intends writing more soldier stories ; for not only is he a veteran of the Spanish War , but he was an Artillery Captain in France during the late conflict . <P> " While in China I bumped into a war , " he told me , " and I wanted to see how it felt to be under fire again . They certainly are stupid fighters : I stood behind a temple wall and let a sharpshooter spatter bullets all over it . He never came within a mile of me ! " My wife , though , got into more serious difficulties . She went out walking one day and just as she was enjoying the scene , the Chinese thought they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies . Fortunately a shell that struck three feet from her proved a dud . When she came in she said : ' Peter , you should have been with me this afternoon . I 've had such an interesting time ! ' " Apparently the Kyne family likes its walks adventuresome-and that 's how Peter B. Kyne strikes me-a charming adventurer who writes romances with that rarest of all gifts , a sense of humor ! J.
