It was no " sick man of Europe " who attacked Greece in 1822 . It was the conquering greedy Turk , bloody scimitar in hand , who hacked his way through the country , finally battered at the walls of Argos . Demetrios Ypsilanti held the citadel with 300 henchmen against 30,000 Turks . For three days Hero Ypsilanti did not budge ; thereafter his name was ranked in Greek legend with Leonidas of Thermopylae . <P> It was in 1825 that a band of Michigan settlers proudly named a rude village Ypsilanti . Last week some 7,000 of its citizens met to see the presentation of a marble bust of Demetrios Ypsilanti to the city by the Archontic Order of the Ahepa , Greek-American patriotic society , 3,500 visiting Ahepans paraded for two miles . Greek Aviator Nick Manteris , of Detroit , dropped a memorial wreath .
