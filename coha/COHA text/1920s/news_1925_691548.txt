John Bremer , probation officer of the Catholic Protective Association , said he would have Brindell on hand at the hearing . Parole Board 's Statement . The Parole Board 's statement was in part as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of the press will be invited . also such persons who may have any information to impart to the board including Samuel Untermyer and Charles Johnson Jr. , who has made affidavits against Brindell . " It is understood that Ernest Boehm , head of the Stenographers and Bookkeepers Union , also will be present . Boehm is said to have given Johnson President of Local 1,436 of t .. e Dock Builders Union , the name of the contractor who paid $2,000 graft to a man alleged to have been Brindell . It was Johnson 's affidavit which brought action by the board . Upon his return yesterday from the Adirondacks where he spent the weekend , Brindell , at his home , 1,890 Daly Avenue . denied the charges in the Johnson affidavit , declared he was trying " to be as honest as a human being could be , " and asserted that the accusations against him smacked of " persecution . " " I have no desire to be associated with organized labor , " Brindell declared . A ? I am not now a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to become a member of a union , but not an officer . " I have nothing to fear and nothing to hide . I welcome , this investigation . It is true that I saw Johnson last January as he states , but I deny all the accusations against me and his report of the conversation . Formerly . I had four persons present , including one of my sons , and they know what happened . Why He Saw Johnson . " I wanted to see Johnson because there were three things I desired to ask him . The first was the status of my membership in Local 1456 . ' In reply to this question Johnson said he wdiild not have entertained ? a motion to dismiss me had not the laws of the Building Trades Council compelled him to do so . " The second question was why the Building Trades Council and the various unions moved out of my , 12 St. Marks Place Building . The only answer he made was that ' the higher-ups ' In the council made that decision . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rent . The council still owes six months ' rent in the building . To this Johnson said he would see to it that the rent was fully paid . " Johnson admitted to me that he and President John Halkett of the Building Trades Council were the men who went to Albany , saw Governor Smith and protested against my being released on commutation six months before I got out . The effort to release me was because of my sick wife to whom I wished to go . My son William was in the room at the time . I saw his face go dark ' when Johnson made this statement and I motioned for him to go out of the TOM . " Johnson is not a delegate to the Building , Trades Council . He is merely President of the local with a nominal salary and also helps the men in compensation claims . Would it not be , ridiculous for me to make a proposition to this man . admittedly without power , to use him as the basis for my return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessed to me in my own home that he prevented me from leaving prison six months earlier than I might have done when Mr. Untermyer and Judge wrote to Governor Smith and said that ? io further good was to be accomplished by my remaining when my sick wife needed me . I know that Johnson blames me for the opposition to him in the local union . Bat how could any one believe that my opposition . if it dial-anything at all in endangering Johnsoe , - would mean my control of the union in ien- of the fact that at the last =election about 1.500 votes were cast for Johnson and about seventeen for his opponent . Can I control the Building Trades with seventeen votes in the Dock Builders ' Union ? ? - Regarding the graft charge wheSe S2.000 is alleged to have passed hands in a restaurant at Eighth-Avenue and Twenty-third Street . I want to say that since my return from prison I have not been on the west side below Forty-second Street . Nor have t meddled in any ugion affair . - The whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as honest as I could be since being placed on parole . Wherever I have gone to speak to men I have hadte-itnesses . The only contractors I have spoken to have been four old friends . -I have r ? . at been in New Jersey since left prison . That disposes of the charge that I had something to do with the strike on a job of the Public Service Production Company . I did not know what that company was until inquired today and found out . " As for the Dock Builders Old Timers Social Club . it is merely a social organization for old dock builders to meet and chat over pigs knuckles , sauerkraut and near-beer . I refused to become an officer in the social club for fear that - it might be misconstrued . " Entermyer Attacks the Board . Mr. Unterrnyer , in a. statement yesterday . asserted that the fact that counsel would not be permitted to examine and cross-examine witnesses confirmed his suspicions " that no genuine investigation is intended . " He criticized the board for not holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that the talk of " precedent " being responsible for the board 's ruling against counsel was " mere prattle. " as precedent had been set aside when Brindell was freed without notify- ? ing the Special Prosecutor , when the board " was forced by public outcry to recall him and impose the conditions which it should have done at the , beginnfrig. " when it held its " whitewashing " hearing : when it remitted the thirty-clay fine imposed on him " 3o as to permit of ' his parole at the earliest possible moment allowed by law : " when " Brindell . was permitted to remain at large , as he , still is , after the filing of these charges , which is contrary to every precedent of the Parole Board , " and ' in departing from Its rule and inviting the members of the press , which , although contrary to precedent , is as it should be . " Untermyer said it was no use inviting him to be present unless he had the necessary status to develop the evidence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere spectator : * In reply to the statement , . Tame . R. Long , Superintendent dl Prisons atfcl member of the board , saki that no meetings of the board had ever been held outside of a prison . He declared that the District Attorney had been notified of Brindell 's parole , and if he did not impart the information to Mr. tintermyer the board was not to blame . It was a , rule of the board not to permit counsel , he explained. - and offered to subpoena witnesses suggested by Mr. Untermyer . As for the remission of the thirty days ' fine from Brit:den 's senPraace. he said that the prisoner earned the . remission through good behavior for a Year -
