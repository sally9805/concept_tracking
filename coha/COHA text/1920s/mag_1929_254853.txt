On a small iron bench in the Pincian Hill gardens slept a holy man . His breviary had fallen from his lap to the grassy turf . Children gravely gathered beside him , for it seemed to them there could be no mistaking the man 's grey hair , his glasses , his still , regular features . " Is it he ? " whispered one to another . <P> " It is , it is he , " they cried excitedly . " Il Papa , it is he , the Pope ! " <P> The excitement awakened the sleeper , who cried out as he arose : " No , no , I am not the Pontiff ! Deny it ! Deny it ! " <P> Down the Pincian Hill with cassock billowing behind him fled the holy one , now thoroughly alarmed . He was only a humble Benedictine monk , but so strongly did he resemble Pius XI that , unconvinced by his protests , one of the children reverently picked up and treasured the little breviary lying on the ground . In humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first step into the great world since his " liberation , " was in the simple quality and disguise of a lowly monk and for the gentle purpose of dozing on a park bench . <P> Last week came definite news of what Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti 's first momentous step outside the Vatican would be . On June 24 , feast of the nativity of St. John the Baptist , he will step into his new Fiat car and drive to the Church of St. John Lateran , * where he will celebrate a mass . The papal motor will contain a sort of back-seat throne , where the Pope alone may sit . Facing the throne will be two chairs where high dignitaries will sit . Thus no one will sit beside the Pope and none , except , of course , the driver , will turn his back upon him when he drives through Roman streets . In such state rides no other monarch , not even Japan 's " Son of Heaven " Emperor . <P> *The " mother of all churches , " where stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
