txt American films are threatened with boycott in Great Britain . People abruptly discovered over 90% of the pictures exhibited here are American . Hostile agitation is gaining momentum , fed by the occasional tactlessness of American film boosters and by newspapers with an anti-American slant . Some criticise American pictures as inane and stupid . Others see in them a Machiavellian conspiracy to demoralize and divide the empire . This is ridiculous . But the warning that the empire is endangered  --  even by films ? always makes many fly to arms . Agitation against American pictures until recently has been led largely by unsuccessful home producers . They blame their failure on the Americans . As Lord Beaverbrook 's Express puts it , " The American organizations are wealthy enough to throttle British film production , as they have choked British cinemas with their films . " Sir Oswald Stoll usually leads an impassioned charge against American pictures at annual meetings of his company when he has a deficit to explain . Experts who know both countries , however , say the real trouble with British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of capital . rinrrign ** NEEDED American producers will have to act quickly to convince the British public theyare not running a dangerous monopoly here . We can not afford to ignore the criticism . The British motion picture market takes about 40% of our tetel film exports , and in many respects is most attractive to American producers . There are 4,000 theaters in Britain . Producing units are worth less than $2,500 , - 000 at present , showing how low home production has fallen . Out of a population of 45.000.000 in Britain there are nearly 15,000.000 regular theatregoers , spending about 5165.000,000 at the box offices . Britain and the Dominions took about 40.000 miles of American films in 1924-25 . A market of this scope is not to be sneezed at . It has a regular and important place in the budgets of our leading film producers . Americans also are leasing and buying theaters in Britain . Paramount is putting up a large theater in Regent Street- Tivoli , the luxurious theater on the Strand , shows Metro-Goldwyn pictures . First National has bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theater to seat some 3,500 . IN ENGLAND British bankers shun motion-picture financing . Money for films comes mostly in small amounts from speculators willing to risk a thousand pounds or so . Two British films were recently financed in Germany . Only half a dozen have made in recent months here . and not over a dozen are in preparation . In any other industry where such large profits can be made . extensive credits would be available . But incompetent producers have hurt financing here . Many theatres are too small and antiquated to bring big returns . Perhaps only a few producers here would have worried about " American film invasion " bad not some of our high pressure publicity experts missed fire on stunts here . One American publicity star , in reply to a welcome from the British trade at a dinner , said that he would put over a certain picture " even if he had to throw a searchlight on Buckingham Palace . " Then there was the agent who secured a British escort of a company of soldiers for an American film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might have passed unnoticed in America . aroused irritation here in all circles , resulted in the film being forbidden and poured Oil on the flumes. 151:5111E01 EX PG01.0%174 ) Various remedies are being put forward to resurrect the British film industry over night . Most have to do with financing . The government should subsidize pictures which demonstrate patriotic and other virtue of the nation . This would be another bribe to prolonged inefficiency as is the subsidy now given to the coal industry . Worthless studios would be kept alive , and good ones penalized . A more reasonable proposal is for a guarantee under the British Trade Facilities Act . This would enable producers to get credit here at about 17 , - over the bank rate . For this producers should get guarantees from exhibitors and thus secure in advance most of their productive costs . But if producers really had the support of exhibitors they would not need this government assistance . The money which flows through the industry could if properly utilized suffice as security for ample credit-. - Many persona are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If American films were shut off there would not be enough British and Continental films combined to replace them . The people here like American pictures . Masse stars who come he:e get a spontaneous reception from the Lord Mayor down to littie school girls . making the publicity man almost superfluous . sit It ** DitA  --  N The simple fact is that American pictures pay , and exhibitors arc not the ones agitating against them now . If they were withdrawn or decreased British box offices would suffer . A dangerous proposal is that to introduce some " contingent " or quota system as in Germany , where an ex ? ifibiter must take a domestic film at the same time as a foreign one . This has made it possible fo'r unscrupulous producers to load the exhibitors with a lot of more or less worthless films . These . as often as not , are left on the shelves . but had to be taken to get the foreign film wanted . Then there is talk of a national studio , more or less in the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quaint variation of it . would establish the national studio in some distant sunny corner of England ? wherever that is  --  as if most pictures were not produced by artificial light .
