In a country such as England or France , where the literary tradition is homogeneous and unbroken and the elementary discoveries about the national character were made long ago , good British novelists do not have to spend their time berating their middle-class public for its stu  --  pidity or the aristocracy for its snobbishness ; nor do the Frenchmen have to write exposures of Gallic sensuality . All these things are taken for granted ; or else it becomes the function of the essayist , the critic , or the political ob  --  server to deal with them . But over here we have to clear away so much rubbish before a novelist can really deal with essential novelistic material . We have to educate an audi  --  ence with a frontier mentality . I presume it is necessary to Mr. Anderson to discover for himself that respectable American business men get restless when they reach forty ; for Mr. Lewis to discover that most American preachers are hypocrites or fools ; for Mr. Bromfield to discover that the dominating influence of women is occasionally a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is difficult for a sensitive young man to live in an industrialized com  --  community . Very good ; all very true and useful ; but let us not get excited about the artistic value of works which em  --  body only these sincere obviousnesses . The real trouble with such discoveries is that it does not require any great wisdom or intelligence to make them . One need not be much more than a cut above Babbitt to realize what sort of man he is ; and Mr. Anderson has apparently shown that to record the vagaries of adolescence and the primary conflicts of naive souls one need not oneself be any  --  thing but adolescent and naive . The result is that our so-called best novelists are a pleasantly unsophisticated lot . Miss Rebecca West , speaking of Sinclair Lewis 's latest work , made a very pugnant ( and un-American ) observation . In the novel there is portrayed , as a sort of counterweight to Elmer Gantry , a liberal clergyman  --  sincere , thoughtful , troubled by the inconsistencies and absurdities of the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the assumption on Mr. Lewis 's part that this clergyman , instead of being an equally fit subject for satire , was really a rather fine and admirable character , the hero to Gantry 's villain  --  all of which shows in Mr. Lewis , of course , nothing but the same sort of thoughtful innocence that is exemplified every day in the pulpits of liberal Unitarian churches . Our most sophisticated novelist is commonly held to be Mr. Cabell . Compared with a life-size artist like Gide or Thomas Mann he is almost tenderly unsophisticated . At most he has a single idea : all his legends but play naughty little variations on the theme of illusion . He is praised for his rebellion against the drab materialism of American life ; but he is a one-dimensional rebel . His cynicism is so terribly easy . On the Continent intelligent men had begun to smile at Anatole France five years before his death ; and even be  --  fore that he had been essentially the pet of the bourgoisie . But here Cabell is still accepted as a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynicisms year after year without much variation to indicate intellectual or emo  --  tional growth . This naivete would not be so disheartening if it were not accompanied by a related phenomenon : an artistic pro  --  vincialism which is unparalleled in the rest of the world . Our established novelists are , in many cases , simply behind the times . They follow the Wellsian or the Galsworthian formula when the more alert young English novelists have themselves abandoned it , when their art might so easily beenriched by an attentive study of the best contemporary French and German writers . But how little attention is paid to such work ! How many of our novelists are con  --  sciously and excitedly aware that the last two years have witnessed the American publication of two great European masterpieces , masterpieces from which one can learn , which contain formal advances , which pose aesthetic problems of an interesting knottiness , which stimulate the mind and raise it above any narrow preoccupation with a too purely American scene ? Schiller 's conception of the naive artist must be abandoned ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moods , as does Mr. Anderson ; or by examining one 's own home town , as does Mr , Lewis ; or by reading the works of Anatole France , as does Mr. Cabell . The novelist must be an extremely intelligent man , one of a world confraternity of intelligent men , sophisticated in the best sense , eager to tackle aesthetic problems because they are difficult , willing to learn from his contemporaries , stern in his rejection of what is obvious or transitory or pro  --  vincial , certain that his material is essentially novel mate  --  rial , not newspaper stuff , not personal moods , not cigarette-smoke irony . That we have at least the beginning of such an attitude is evident in the work of Hemingway , Wescott , Elizabeth Roberts , Aiken  --  and it is noticeable that each of these , in his or her own way , is revolting against the novelistic old guard . But this other side of American fiction deserves a separate and distinct treatment which is impossible here . Plastic and Temporal in Art By JOSEPH WOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as part of 1 any movement , it is with T. S. Eliot and the other in  --  tellectualists that his thought allies him ; but nothing could , on the other hand , be more unlike the costiveness of their minds than is the fluency of his . Ostensibly prophets of a new faith engaged in announcing the glad tidings of a sal  --  vation by abstract thought , a certain despairing lassitude has unreasonably enough fallen upon them and it is with the greatest difficulty that they succeed in squeezing from their minds . two paragraphs of prose or one quatrain of verse per year . With him , on the contrary , the pen can never keep pace with the brain and one treatise is not half done before another is projected . Originally a painter , he has been led on from subject to subject and , plunging with enormous gusto into the midst of the abstrusest problems , he has emerged each time from a review of countless vol  --  umes with a great deal to say about everything . Within less than two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , but he has the air of a man who is just warming up to his subject , and the latest ends , charac  --  teristically enough , with the statement that it is merely a prolegomenon intended to clear the ground for his own thesis by a criticism of prevailing theories . Like all of Mr. Lewis 's books " Time and Western Man " 1 includes almost too much for a single treatise and its method is highly discursive . Book One , " The Revolu  --  tionary Simpleton , " offers perhaps the most interesting criticism which has ever been made of such leaders in con temporary " revolutionary " literature as Ezra Pound , James Joyce , and Gertrude Stein , along with incidental comment upon the world of what Mr. Lewis calls " High Bohemia " in which various artistic fads become fashionable ; but Book Two , " An Analysis of the Philosophy of Time , " brings him to the theoretical consideration of certain habits of thought which he regards as the ultimate cause of the failure of modern literature and which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he is , Mr. Lewis considers to be the father of the contemporary time cult , and he traces through Russell , Einstein , Whitehead , and Alexander the growth of an orthodoxy within the limits of which all the leaders of contemporary metaphysics are comprehended by virtue of a common agreement that time is the ultimate reality , or , much more properly , that it supplies the aspect under which all phenomena may be most profitably re  --  garded . This " time-mind , " generating as it does a venera  --  tion in the philosopher for mere flux as such and producing in even the popularizer a tendency to regard nothing im  --  portant except as part of a history or an evolution , Mr. Lewis attacks as fundamentally antithetical to the processes of art and hence as inimical to the development of any sat  --  isfactory human society . It reaches , he says , its ultimate absurdity in the misty lucubrations of Spengler , who seems to maintain that the Western World is dying because it alone has risen to a realization that nothing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforms all those who have any aesthetic sensibility into what he scornfully calls " time  --  trotters " ? people , that is to say , whose minds rush back and forth through the centuries " doing " the culture of this period and that much as the globe-trotter " does " the medieval cathedrals one summer and the civilization of India the next . " Plastic " is the adjective which Mr. Lewis chooses to describe that aspect of things upon which he prefers to concentrate his attention . It is a painter 's word , and one may suspect that it is employed by him in such a way as to include not merely those relationships in space which are the elementary concerns of the painter but also those which a metaphysician would call " logical " and which a mystic would describe as those perceived when a thing is seen sub specie aeternitatis . It serves , however , as well as any other to stand for all that is missed when we fall into the habit of assuming that we have plucked the heart out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its death as an evolution occurring in time ; and we reach the crux of the matter in a passage cited by Mr. Lewis in high disapproval from Alexander 's " Space , Time , and Deity . " " It is , in fact , " says Alexander , " the cardinal de  --  fect of universals as conceived by Plato or the Pythagoreans that they were changeless , immovable , and eternal . For not even the mind of Plato could be free from the habits of his age , one of whose tendencies was to seek the highest ideal of perfection in gravity of action and statuesque repose rather than in restless motion . . . . It is claiming no great credit that for us universals should have from the beginning the form of motion , should be not merely spatial but spatio  --  temporal . " Upon this patronage of Plato and his fellow-ancients Mr. Lewis empties the vials of his scorn . The thing to be noted is , he points out , the contrast implied in the fact that while the essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that static perfection toward which it wastending , it has become for us , living in a time-world , rather the history of the thing 's evolution or even , at times , merely the nature of its origin . And against the assumption that this change of attitude represents a gain , that man can live better or more profitably as part of a flux which has no meaning outside itself , Mr. Lewis protests with all vigor . Though we may be children of time we want to be children of eternity , and though I am not sure Mr. Lewis would ac  --  cept this formulation of the dilemma it will serve never  --  theless to illuminate the direction of his striving . " What I am concerned with here , first of all , is , " he says , " not whether the great time-philosophy that overshadows all contemporary thought is viable as a system of abstract truth , but if in its application it helps or destroys our hu  --  man arts . With that is involved , of course , the very funda  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our human condition ( as formerly Nietzsche and then Bergson claimed that we should ) ; or whether we should transplant into human terms the whole of our datum . My standpoint is that we are creatures of a certain kind , with no indication that a radical change is imminent . . . . I pre  --  fer the chaste wisdom of the Chinese or the Greek to the hot tawny brand of superlative fanaticism coming from the parched deserts of the Ancient East , with its ineradicable abstractness . I am for the physical world . " The argument of " Time and Western Man , " carrying though it does an immense burden of detailed criticism directed against the chief exponents of the time philosophy , is conducted with great acuteness and illuminated with flashes of maliciously humorous characterization like that in which Bertrand Russell , " whose mind is that of an ex  --  cited and rather sentimental amateur , " is described as a man possessed of an entertainer 's instinct which leads him always to take the " entertaining " or " exciting " side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarified from a metaphysical standpoint if Mr. Lewis would state more clearly than he does whether , in his championship of the " plastic " against the " temporal " view- of reality , he attacks the latter as a falsely assumed " truth of reference " or merely as a conception functioning less fruitfully than the plastic view when each is considered merely as an als ob . But since he is chiefly concerned with art or with **25;0;TOOLONG , and since in the realm of art the distinction between a " truth of reference " and a fruitful als ob inevitably disappears , this defect is not of great importance . Indeed the disappearance of this distinction is exactly the thing which differentiates art from life , and though the present book is only a prolegomenon it is easy to see that Mr. Lewis 's line of thought must eventuate in a plea for the absolute and formal virtues of a " classical " literature , painting , or sculpture . May it not indeed be said that the entire contemporary renaissance of interest in " form " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is closed and com  --  plete in itself  --  for something with a pattern in which each part is so joined to every other part that it returns upon itself instead of either leading on to something else or trailing off until it is lost in the dark boundless chaos ? Romantic art had as one of its ideals a suggestive incom  --  pleteness , a deliberate imperfection intended to provoke rather than to satisfy and to suggest boundlessness rather than boundaries . The stories which it told are not stories with a beginning and an end but episodes , lifted almost at random , from an endless chronicle to which the imagination is led back again at the inconclusive conclusion and in which its thoughts and emotions as well as its events are left dangling . But the human mind wearies at length of expansion and inconclusion . It turns to art for the com  --  pleteness and the perfection which it does not find in na  --  ture , and it discovers even in rigidity a certain peace . It asks of art a pattern , something which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not object to the absence of that inclusion of opposites aimed at by the romantics if it can receive in exchange a sense of equilibrium existing within the limits which the work of art , detaching itself from the stream of life , sets up . And it is just this which a classic art supplies . It leads the imagination not into life and time but out of both into a world so frozen as to seem to be seen sub specie aeternitatis because it exists , each part locked together with each other part , within the confines of a frame and hence is as complete and changeless for us as life itself has been fancied to be in the mind of that God for whom all moments are one . A Hero of the Jews By NORMAN HAPGOOD ? N the long history of the Jews the supreme hero is Moses . I Talk to the most cultivated and skeptical Jew of your acquaintance and if he is race-conscious he will thrill to that name . Moses led the Jews out of bondage and just failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have succeeded had there not been an alarmist re  --  port from the majority of the committee sent ahead to report on the prospects and difficulties , only Caleb bringing a minority report that was optimistic . So the glory of leading the entry was reserved for Joshua . It is not to either of these chieftains that Theodore Herzl is to be compared  --  the prophet of Zionism in modern days . What his biographer claims for him is that " in the long page of Jewish history he stands with Ezra and Simon the Maccabee  --  the two peaceful restorers of the Jew  --  ish state . " It is a proud enough claim . A complete , authoritative , and readable story of the prophet of modern Zionism comes at an opportune time , since one of the results of the war that can be put down as favorable is the Balfour resolution and the commitment of the British Empire to carry out , on its political side , the Zionist dream . It was with the political side  --  in the deep , human sense  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rulers of the world in behalf of an escape for a people that during his career went through direst agony . Mr. de Haas , his dear friend , associate , and spokes  --  man , says that " among the Jews no other since the destruc  --  tion of Jerusalem sought to achieve so great a result and accomplished so much toward his end . " The idea of a spiritual center , a home for an age-long culture , which appeals to many , including Christian Zionists like myself , was not what came first with Herzl . Nor had he sympathy with the financial Jews , like the Rothschilds , who looked upon him as too Jewish and wished to forget the past and put as little stress as might be on the racial line . This class in its culture was assimilating , * " Theodore Herzl A Biographical Study .

He made no claim that the Jews were better than other people , and no concession that they were worse . The theological " mis  --  sion of Israel " was nothing to him . It was " the drum-beat that drowned out Dreyfus 's plea of innocence " that shocked Herzl back to his origins . He had no Ghetto tradition to make him timid . He stood up audaciously and " took the sting out of the term Jew . " We know the difference in America between the Jew who regrets the word and the one who takes it to his soul . Max Nordau one day at breakfast said to Herzl : " Were I a believer , and did I ordinarily use mystical phrases , I should say your appearance in these critical days of Jewish history is the work of Providence . " In the crisis of 1895 and 1896 hope was at its lowest ebb . So harried were the Jews in Russia , Poland , and Rumania that migration was forced . Countries further west were anti-Semitic openly although less violently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first Herzl sought only a Jewish state , anywhere , as an escape from horrors ; later he became con  --  vinced that no place but Palestine would do . Palestine , as his imagination pictured it forth for the days to come , was a large area from Kantara to Beirut , from Jaffa to Hamann , with historic landmarks as jewels in a world evolved by modern machinery and science ; a Nile canalized to make fruitful the Sinai desert ; the Litani River joined to the Kishon so that both could water the plain of Esdrae  --  lon ; the Jordan raised to irrigate the dry southland ; tall chimneys and chemical works ; industrial agriculture ; the whole Near East a thriving center , with Palestine and its modern harbor forming a littoral . To his mind the Ghetto was a thing created artificially by the slow process of hostile law , and the normal direction was as pictured by his dream . He needed to do many things ; his two greatest triumphs were his burning message to the suffering masses and his negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , and Austria . He who was to lead the despairing and also to make use of potentates had need of an imperial nature . At the Congress of Uganda , in which Herzl presented , coming from Joseph Chamberlain , the first offer of the British government of land for colonization in East Africa , the site to be determined , there were 295 votes for Herzl , 177 against acceptance . The 177 , who were for Zion or noth  --  ing , withdrew in protest to a smaller hall where they de  --  bated , wept , and gesticulated . At ten o'clock , after four hours , they were on the verge of hysteria . Men were begin  --  ning to sit on the floor and in the orthodox traditional manner to mourn for a Zion that was dead . When word of this hysteria reached Herzl at his hotel he rushed to the building and found that the dissenters had locked themselves in . He shouted his name , pounded until the door opened , strode dramatically through the delegates , and said : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . We Jews were condemned , despised , an untolerated minor  --  ity . I was born in that environment ; so were my children .
