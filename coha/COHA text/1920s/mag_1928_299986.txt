Last week at Bad Kissingen , Germany , E. D. Bogoljubow , onetime Russian chess champion , paced the floor while he awaited his opponent 's move . When Dr. Max Euwe of Holland made his move and pushed the handle on the timepiece that began eating up the seconds allotted to Bogoljubow , the latter made no lunge for the seat which he had vacated . In his mind the board was quite as clear as though he had it placed before him . He was not worried . All he needed was a draw to win first place in the International Grand Masters Tournament , to repeat his triumph gained at Moscow three years before . On the 36th move he succeeded ; achieved a situation which his opponent could not prevent his repeating ad infinitum if the aggressor wished it . He did . <P> Thus ended the contest between twelve of the world 's greatest masters of the game . Each had played eleven times , once with each of his opponents . <P> U. S. champion , rugged , cigar-smoking Frank James Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Capablanca , Cuban , former world 's champion , took second money . Though his final score was less than Bogoljubow 's , a moral victory was his , for he had defeated Bogoljubow in their only personal tilt . <P> The Cuban has often observed that it is not always the most brilliant player who wins a tournament . In fact it is more often the exception than the rule for the special brilliancy prize to be awarded to the victor . <P> He has maintained that modern exhaustive analysis has brought the game to the point at which one of his shrewdness can draw every game he plays , that theoretically to gain a victory one must dare an unsound combination . If , sufficiently intricate , its weakness fails to be detected , the game is won . Alternative is defeat . Thus less imaginative plodders can take advantage of more brilliant players ' hazardous conceptions .
