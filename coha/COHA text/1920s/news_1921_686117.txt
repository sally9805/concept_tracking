txt NON-PARTISAN LEAGUE VOTE . Not 3,000,000 , as The New Republic Would Have it , but 1,235,824 . To the Editor of The New York Times : Following the recent election , The New Republic had some comment on the showing made by the Non-Partisan League , in which it has always displayed a friendly if rather patronizing interest . All of its comment Was based on the premise that the league had polled 3,000,000 votes in the nine States in which it had candidates . I immediately wrote to the editors of the magazine calling their attention to the fact that the league had actually polled but a little more than 1,000,000 votes , but my letter was ignored . On at least two occasions since then I have attempted to get The New Republic to correct its misstatements , for the official figures , taken from the league 's own organ , show that the total vote polled in the nine States was 1,235,824 . In view of the rather hectic way in which The New Republic professes to pursue " the truth " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising that it Would refuse to correct such a glaring misstatement . Its entire comment was based on the fact that the " protest vote " was up as high as 3,000,000 , so surely it should be worthy of note when that " protest vote " is reduced by about CO per cent . But apparently the young internationalists who edit . The New Republic believe in truth for others but not for themselves . JAMES E. ROCKWELL , Editor Fargo Forum . Fargo , N.
