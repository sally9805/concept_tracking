In recent maneuvers off : the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal , the United States fleet operated in complete tactical drill with the aircraft carrier Langley , 146 flights being made on and off the deck of the Langley , without casualty to plane or personnel . <P> When flights are undertaken , the upper deck of the Langley is completely cleared ; masts and smokestacks and all other paraphernalia disappear . The Secretary of the Navy , Admirals , Captains and gobs jump into nets on the sides of the ship , with conspicuous lack of dignity , when a plane is about to alight . The getaway of an airplane is easy . But landing on the deck of the steaming war-vessel , pitching and rolling as it must , is a risky proposition . The deck looks broad to any one standing on it , but it is a mere strip to the anxious pilot . As the wheels of the airplane touch the landing surface , the pilot drops a large hook which engages with wires laid across the deck so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running along the length of the ship and prevent the airplane from turning . <P> The possibility of landing on and off a shipdeck gives full tactical value to the naval airplane , and Navy men are greatly impressed with the success of these maneuvers . Two new aircraft carriers , converted from the hulls of battle cruisers doomed by the Washington Naval conference , are to be put into commission . These will be longer , wider and steadier than the Langley .
