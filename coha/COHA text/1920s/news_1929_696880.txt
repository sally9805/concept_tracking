txt For the first time since , it came into power as the result of the Labor party 's victory at the polls last May , the Government today declared itself officially in favor of a Socialist scheme within the popular understanding of what the term " socialism " means , so far as public ownership of transportation facilities is concerned . The announcement was from Her , bert Morrison , Minister of Transport , in reply to a question in the House of Commons and the abbreviated bulletin form in which his reply first emerged from the Parliament buildings to the general public created a great sensation in London . There was momentary fear on the part of the Conservatives and momentary hope on the part of the radicals that at last the Socialist Government was really going to carry out the policies for which one part of the country damns it and the other part blesses it . The Welfare Measures . Although the various welfare m6asures , such as pension bills and unemployment acts , already introduced by the government are really socialistic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to give to those who have not , they none of them have that hallmark of socialism as popularly understood which is implied in the words " public ownership . " Hence they have been criticized by the opposition in and out of Parliament merely as unwise and uneconomic . But today a Cabinet Minister actually used the words " public ownership " and there was a shudder . It was a needless shudder , however , for as it turned out the expression was quite academic and ? had ? no more immediacy than the expression " Do , minion status for India , " which all British Governments and parties I have been using for the last twelve years without any intimation as to whether such status should be granted a year hence or a century hence . So , apparently , it is with the public ownership of London 's transportation systems . The question which provoked the discussion came from a Labor member who asked if the government was now in a position to state its policy concerning the London traffic situation . In the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister , the Minister of Transport said that the government was convinced that no lasting solution of the dual problem of congestion of the streets and proper travel facilities for the public . would be found unless further steps were taken for the elimination of unnecessary and uneconomic competition . Sees Unification Essential . A far-reaching measure of unification under public control was essential to progress . Mr. Morrison said , and there was little doubt that elimination of the present - wasteful competition would result in sufficient revenue being obtained from the several undertakings at the present level of fares to attract new capital ' and to provide for the steady and progressive development of the whole traffic system . It was after this allusion to the attraction of new capital that the Minister of Transport made his re- mark on public ownership , saying : " The public interest can be safeguarded only if existing sectional and financial interests are consolidated by a single simple form of public ownership- for the complicated network of private municipal interests which now add so greatly to the difficulties of the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public ownership should be applied , they desire to make clear that its intention is to assert and effectively provide for the principle of the commercial management of a self-supporting and consolidated transport system ; thus insuring the advantages of a : vigorous business enterprise . " What was fully as relevant to the situation as Mr. Morrison 's announcement in the House of Commons was his statement earlier in the day to the effect that he hoped the various traction companies of London would in the near future seek Parliamentary authority to extend their present lines and increase their facilities . The magnitude of any scheme of public ownership of London 's traffic facilities may be judged from the fact that the capital involved amounts to more than $650,000,000 . Excluding the suburban tracks of the big rail companies and independent omnibus services , the latest figures show that the three main divisions of the existing traffic combination are capitalized as follows : Railways , $400,000,000 ; tramways , $135,000,000 , and omnibuses , $35 , - 000,000.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
