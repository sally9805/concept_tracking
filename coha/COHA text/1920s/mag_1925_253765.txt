One day last week , the nine members of the U. S. Supreme Court filed into their sombre round room in the Capitol , took their places , came to order , began reading opinions . After 21 opinions had been read , Chief Justice Taft arose . <P> " Gentlemen of the bar , " said he . " Mr. Justice McKenna has announced to us , his colleagues of the Court , his purpose to retire from the bench . He has presented his resignation to the President , who has accepted it . As his associates , we have expressed our feelings toward him in a personal letter which I shall now read . " <P> The letter marvelled , with affectionate respect , at the " extended and varied experience " of Joseph McKenna-born 1833 , taken at 12 by gold-seeking parents to California ; lawyer , Congressman , at the last Senior Justice of the Supreme Court these dozen years . <P> Justice McKenna replied in kind : " I thank you for your expressions of esteem . . . . They mitigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> As he finished , Frank Key Green , Mlarshal of the Court , laid a basket of red roses on the table in front of Justice McKenna , The Marshal tapped his gavel . The Court stood . Justice McKenna shook hands with Mr. Justice Taft , bowed right , bowed left , slowly descended from the bench , slowly left the room .
