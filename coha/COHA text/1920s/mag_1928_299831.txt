A nun named after the Most Blessed Conception of the Virgin Mary continued the focus of Mexican news last week . She had been besmirched ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) . A youth and a girl had confessed that she was the " master mind " of a group of Roman Catholics who finally persuaded a fanatic to assassinate President-elect Alvaro Obregon ( TIME , July 30 ) . In the face of such testimony Mother Superior Concepcion remained calm and demanded to be faced by her accusers last week . <P> " Do not invent lies , Eulogio Gonzales , " she said to the youth who had informed against her . " Tell the truth , Eulogio , even though it cost you your life . " * <P> " W-w-well ... " stammered Eulogio Gonzales , " whatever Mother Concepcion says is truth .

" And pretty Maria Elena Manzano sobbingly retracted . <P> Since a cloud of witnesses testified ( without retraction ) that the convent presided over by Mother Superior Concepcion was a rendezvous for so-called " Catholic plotters , " the examining official " said sharply to her : <P> " It seems very strange to me that you should receive so many plotters and not know what they talked about . " <P> " I never even asked who they were , " responded Mother Concepcion , " half the people of Mexico came , to attend religious services . " <P> Though these developments convinced many persons of the immaculate innocence of Mother Concepcion , they comprised a mere incident in the broad and sweeping criminal investigation now being conducted by Mexico City 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The General , an intimate and brother-in-arms of General Obregon is determined , perhaps too determined , to find out that the assassin , one Jos de Leon Toral , an insignificant Roman Catholic fanatic , was not the sole author of the crime as he still insists that he was . <P> <P> *She did not say " my life , " though it was she , not he , who was in physical danger .
