A pensive grocer sat , his chin snuggled in his palm , at the rear of the Cincinnati convention hall where this past week the American Wholesale Grocers ' Association was holding its yearly meeting . Before him on the convention floor wholesalers rose in diverse and unpredictable fashion to explode with the troubles of their business . On the platform President J. H. McLaurin of the association stormed at his constituents . They must fight together to preserve themselves , he cried ; they must support the individual store keeper ; they must oppose the chain store . <P> The Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. of America was the particular butt of his displeasure , because , with its 15,536 stores in the U. S. and Canada , it is the largest chain organization in the world . Last week it published the profits of its fiscal ( business ) year , which ended Feb. 29 . Those profits were $18,411,119 . <P> President McLaurin 's method of attacking the A. &; P. organization was the subtle way of innuendo . Said he : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific represents at this time a monopolistic control of retail food distribution , but we do undertake to express our opinion that the organization as now conducted , possesses the potentiality of a control of retail food distribution to such an extent as to threaten the best interests of the American public . Is Federal control of that organization in prospect ? Will the conduct of chain stores generally be such within the next few years as to bring about such a degree of ' cooperation ' and ' understanding ' among the largest ones as to attract the eye and attention of the Department of Justice ? " <P> This roundabout suggestion of Federal investigation followed the positive demand made in Manhattan last week by the executive committee of the National Association of Retail Meat Dealers that the Federal Trade Commission study the business methods of all chain store organizations . The butchers accuse the chain stores of misleading advertisements , false bargain sales , short weights and price cutting. * <P> Although there is nothing overt to indicate that these two almost simultaneous attacks against chain food stores were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food distributers are developing an aggressive defense against the expansion of chain store business . Such tactics may indeed stir food chains to merge . At present they number about 800 ( with 60,000 stores competing with about 300,000 independent retail stores ) . Hitherto chain stores have been highly individualistic , each system spreading out like strawberry vines from a parent plant . Nor have they , except for the Kroger grocery stores and the J. C. Penney dry goods stores , done much to soften public opinion excited against them by the neighborhood store keepers . Kroger 's and Penney 's this year have set afoot large campaigns of " institutional " advertising , praising the service of the chains and attempting to " humanize " them . Penney 's , especially , is utilizing the personality of James Cash Penney , its founder . Other chains , on the other hand , keep up the policy of vending food impersonally.
