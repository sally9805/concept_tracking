txt Abniit 1.500 members of the Actors ' Equity ** meeting . yesterday-Afternoon in the hotel Astor , refused by a 3-to-1 vote the proposal of producing managers and playwrights that Equity should use its influence to obtain a seven-night week for legitimate theatrical productions here and in other cities . This automatically ends for the time being the possibility of Sunday night shows in Broadway 's legitimate houses which has been agitating actors for some weeks . Subsequently , with Only one dissenting vote , the meeting adopted a counter-resolution proposed by the Equity Council , . which scored sharply the legitimate managers for their practices in dealing with the speculators and cut-rate ticket agents , and for the discourteous Way in which their theatres are operated compared with the policy of politeness that governs the motion-picture houses .

The resolution said further : " If and when the managers shall first establish the invariable custom of selling a substantial portion of the best seats in all sections of the house to all attractions at the box office at box-office prices ; and , second , shall inaugurate a system which shall insure the public that the seats which are sold to the agencies shall be sold at a fixed premium : meaning plainly that the manager shall do away completely with the unconscionable gyping ' at present practiced on Broadway , which has without doubt done more than any other one thing to alienate the good-will of the public from the theatre ; and , third , shall revise the system of selling cut-rate tickets so that all the money from their sale shall go to the theatres themselves instead of a large proportion of it going to a private concern ; and , fourth , shall see to it that a stop is put to the discourtesy and supercilious insolence practiced in most of the theatres by box-office attendants and other employes who come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfailing courtesy of the employes of the picture houses , which are the chief competitors complained pf by the managers , then , in that case , if it shall appear that these remedies have not solved the economic problems of the theatre , the Equity Association will very seriously consider the question of allowing its members to play on Sunday nights whenever such playing is legal or shall become legal , provided always that in lieu of Sunday night another night in the week be given the actor for rest and recuperation . " The resolution concluded by pledging Equity 's cooperation in working out the suggested reforms . In his speech Mr. Cantor said : " They say that there is a disease in the theatre ; I claim it is a cancer . To cure cancer the medical profession uses radium , and if Sunday night performances are permitted it is comparable to alleviating the disease by treating it with dope . That wo n't cure it .

" Among actors it was said last night that the result of the Equity vote had been in doubt until Mr. Cantor addressed the meeting , but that his talk made the vote certain . Since the days of the Equity strike , the actors ' organization has been opposed to Sunday night shows , in the belief that its members needed a day of rest , and it was this disapprov-d1 which helped to keep a law against them on the books . At the annual meeting of 1928 , chiefly through the advocacy of Mr. Brady , a committee , consisting of Mr. Barlow , George Rosener and Clarke Silvernail , was appointed to investigate the matter , The committee 's report emphatically recommended Sunday , performances .                @ @ @ @ @
