txt To the Editor of The New York Times : So that you may know how Americans are handled in the Ruhr by the French , let me give you my experience . On May 16 I left Essen for Berlin . The train rumblbd along slowly , being stopped from time to time by soldiers on the track , and after a ' three hours ' ride over what should take three-quarters of an hour , we came to the last part of the occupied territory , just outside of Hamm . Here , at'a siding outside of the station , the train was stopped by thePrench and cries of " Alles aussteigen " bade every one to get out . I. carrying my two grips , got out of the crowded train into the rain with perhaps MO other people . At the side of the track , ' where a provisionary custom house had been built , the people were huddled together by French soldiers . Owing to the fact that the several tracks between the train and the so I called custom hou'se were dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were huddled together was mud and puddles , I and many others tndeavored to stand on the tracks until our turn came , so that we coulrl pass the French custom house . French " soldiers ; however , walked up and down these tracks , yelling at the peopit , as . if they were beasts and ordering them to stand in the mud . One of these soldiers endeavored to push .. me into the mud with the others . I told him in French to - go slow , that I was an American and not an animal . He immediately yelled at me in half German , half French , to get down with the other dogs and stuck his face In mine . The only thing that prevented me from - smashing him on the nose was the fact that he and the other soldiers would have , no doubt , either killed or ' wounded me at once . Every one in America knows the equivalent of the German expression of " Du Schweinehund .. weg ! " which language the soldier used to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to his officer . At first he refused to do this , and I seemed to be on the point of being thrown from the - dry spot into the mud . . He . however , took the advice of one of the other soldiers and took me to the officer in charge of the improvised custom house . The officer , who stood with the dogwhip in his hand , was all civility when he found I was American and apologized for the fact that his men could not tell me from a German . As there was nothing further to do , I told him that his men should not act as if all people who traveled on a train were animals and that I would take the matter up with our Embassy . I finally got into the train again after having altogether stood in the rain for over , an hour . I speak French and German . I am obliged to be in the different European countries for the interests of several important American firms besides my own , and I must say that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the occupied territory as I have seen , there ' is no doubt in my mind that some day there will be another red streak from Cologne to Paris .
