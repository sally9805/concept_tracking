Immediately upon the return of Chancellor Luther and Foreign Minister Stresemann from London , where they signed the Locarno Treaties ( see INTERNATIONAL ) , the Cabinet of the Reich resigned . Chancellor Luther had been obliged to promise that his Government would take this step in order to gain sufficient votes for the Locarno Treaties in the Reichstag ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) , the understanding being that the Socialists and others who came to the Treaties ' rescue would be rewarded with posts in the next Cabinet . Of course the fact that the three Nationalists in the Cabinet had previously resigned as a protest against the Treaties ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) had also made it desirable that the " rump-Cabinet " thus created should step down when the Treaties were safe . <P> President von Hindenburg was universally expected to ask Dr , Luther to form the new Cabinet , with the foregone conclusion that he would ask Herr Stresemann to return as Foreign Minister . According to custom the members of a German Cabinet that has resigned continue to exercise their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus no need for immediate action on the part of President von Hindenburg . Well informed observers opined that New Year 's Day might come and go before the new Cabinet is created .
