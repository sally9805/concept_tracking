MAN RISES TO PARNASSUS-Henry Fairfield Osborn-Princeton University Press ( $2.50 ) . Ages and ages ago , but eons after primates became distinctly monkeys , apes and men , mankind began his fumbling rise to earthly supremacy . The start was probably on the plateaus of Central Asia and the first men were certainly runners . They hunted to live . Descendants of theirs who wandered into other plateaus of the continents continued the hunting life . Others traveled into forests and became climbers , others into level lowlands and became squatting farmers ; others into seashores and became aquatic . Millennia spent in the same sort of places developed distinct types of men . But of whatever type they were , and wherever they lived , they improved their lots . The more difficult it was to gain a livelihood , the quicker and the farther they rose in mentality and spirit . And the purer a race kept itself , the quicker and higher it rose among its neighbors . Today , writes the shrewdly erudite president of the American Museum of Natural History , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , he laments , " so many of its best men have left the homeland for America that today the dependent class is relatively large ; realizing these conditions , the Scandinavian people have set on foot a movement to keep the best men and women at home , and such a movement has also been begun in the United States . Such new racial consciousness is a hopeful sign , and with it before our eyes we need not despair . " By such conclusion , Dr. Osborn puts a controversial colophon to his otherwise straightforward exposition of man 's rise to Parnassus . Men are sure to debate his point acrimoniously.
