At most U. S. colleges there exist two kinds of faculty members : the teaching professors and the research professors . Dear to the heart of the undergraduate is many a teaching professor . Him they afterward remember for what little light and learning they possess , and also for his eccentricities , for good fellowship . When they grow old they swap anecdotes about him ; if they become Trustees they like to see him prosper in his fashion . But the research professors , who sometimes regard the civilizing of students as a vague , even faintly vulgar waste of time , are the darlings of their erudite colleagues and often of the president , who feels the responsibility of keeping the University in a good competitive position intellectually . Between the two groups occasionally there is mild academic friction . Last week at Yale there was strife . <P> Associate Professor Robert Dudley French of the English department is a teaching professor as well as a scholar . Graduated from Yale in 1910 , he returned to teach in 1915 . In 1920 he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livened it , taught it well , increasing the enrolment from 30 to 300 in nine years . <P> When Dean Wilbur Lucius Cross of the Graduate School announced this fall that he would retire from the faculty at end of the year , a full professorship in the English department was left vacant . After 14 years of well-received teaching at Yale , popular Mr. French hoped that the fruits of his long labors might be rewarded . But another consideration arose last month . He was offered the Provostship of Avon Old Farms , a pretentious two-year-old experimental school at Avon , Conn . <P> If he was to get his professorship , Mr. French felt that he must decline the school 's offer . He went to the English department , forthrightly asked if he was to receive the position . As forthrightly the English board met , voted unfavorably four to three . Their fancy fell upon Assistant Professor Frederick Albert Pottle of the Graduate School , a mighty young authority on Johnsoniana . <P> With tumult and with shouting Pedagog French 's friends and disciples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation solemnly convened , voted to create an extra professorship for him , submitted the proposal to the English board . Again and astoundingly came the negative vote , four to three . President James Rowland Angell accepted Pedagog French 's resignation , with customary expressions of regret . The triumph of Research over Teaching seemed complete . <P> Sixty-one indignant undergraduates published a signed manifesto in the Yale Daily News , crying : ' ' The withdrawal of Mr. French signifies , as well as an incalculable loss to the university , a demoralizing blow directed against those who stand out for the principles upon which he has based his work ... an irreparable injury to the principle of a ' finer , not a bigger Yale , ' which we have been led to respect . " <P> Simultaneously Dr. Henry Seidel Canby , editor of the Saturday Review of Literature , Yale lecturer , promoter of Avon Old Farms , announced that , sorry as he was to see Pedagog French leave Yale , he was glad to get him at Avon . Said Dr. Canby : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the educational area in which good teaching and the sympathetic handling of youth are so important , but shifting his ground . . . .
