One and three-quarters centuries make a long time . Few U. S. communities are so old . In one tenth that time , many a U. S. community has changed entirely-the German and Swedish farmers of a Wisconsin county into jitney-riding city stenographers and factory hands ; the Italian truck-gardeners of an Ohio township into the proprietors of a bootlegging " Little Italy . " Americanization crusades and Progress have made racial slag , temporarily , of much that was pure foreign metal in the North . In the South and Far West , what remains of the Spanish scarcely suffices to fill the realty booklets . <P> Last week , however , there was enacted an idyl which served to remind U. S. citizens that their country has not so inaccurately been called a New United Europe . In Louisiana , near the Mississippi 's mouth , there remains a section still racially pure and traditionally almost a country within a country , the Bayou Teche country of the French who fled from Grand Pr , Canada , in 1755 . They are les Acadiens . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Claudel went there . " Vous tes ici parmi les Franais , " a serious local dignitary told him . " Nos ancstres sont fraais , nos sentiments sont fraais , notre religion est fraais . " It was so surprisingly true that the good Ambassador felt himself deeply touched by it all . <P> It was full springtime in the South and Ambassador Claudel is a poet famed and , in the French sense , serious . It was full springtime and the poet-ambassador was finding travel restful after a winter of buzzy Washington . He had seen Florida . He was going next to Tennessee . In between came this spot of which he had heard so much and he was prepared to luxuriate in it . <P> With him traveled his more-than-pretty daughter , Mlle. Marie Antoinette Claudel , * blonde , blue-eyed , ready to pass from jeune fille to grande dame . Doubtless she would find New Orleans , where gallantry is understood , more enchanting than Washington , where flattery keeps its net mended to capture the mayflies of gossip so important to political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sort of homecoming , but in not quite the same blissful passivity as he , Paul Claudel , poet . <P> At New Orleans , there was a State reception , with the very corpulent Mayor O'Keefe and other officials standing by . There were bouquets , compliments and invitations for Mademoiselle . For M. 1'Ambassadeur there was an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Loyola University , such as was given to le Marchal Foch some years ago . Then they set out with Maurice de Simonin , the French consul-general , for the small towns and villages-Donaldsonville , Napoleonville , St. Martinville , New Iberia , in the bayou country . <P> A steamy morning mist lay on the roads . The French peasants , for that is what they are , trudged to work . But for the trailing moss on the live-oaks it was like a southern province at home , in real France . The men doffed their hats , whether or not they knew who it was that rode in the so beautiful automobile , The women answered questions volubly and swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Napoleonville she made them catch their breaths when she laid her freshest bouquet at the base of a new memorial inscribed Aux Morts de la Patrie.
