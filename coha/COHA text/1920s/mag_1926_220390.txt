" Little Flower " <P> Sirs : <P> I read with interest your little article regarding the relics of St. Therese , the " Little Flower of Jesus " ( TIME , May 10 ) . The footnote states that she was born in 1873 and died in 1879 . The second date is , of course , 1897 . <P> This is no doubt the printer 's error , but it is perhaps well to notify our less informed brethren so that they may not think the Church found it expedient to recognize the saintliness of a six-year-old child . St. Therese was a Carmelite nun , 24 years of age at the time of her death . <P> S. D.

I have not seen Macfadden 's article , so I do not know who are the authorities whose names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book of Mr. Ellis Barker , who quotes literally hundreds of authorities to the effect that the most probable cause of cancer is canned and denatured foods . And Sir Arbuthnot Lane , England 's best surgeon , says in substance that Mr. Barker knows the cause of cancer and the remedy . Perhaps these are Macfadden 's authorities . At any rate , while the doctors are disagreeing , he certainly has a right to his opinion . <P> Let me add that 20 years ago I was a very sick man and I went to the best orthodox authorities , and except for such matters as surgery and dentistry , they did me no good whatever , and they charged me many thousands of dollars . Bernard McFadden taught me how to keep well and charged me nothing . So whenever I see " vicious " attacks upon him I rise to tell what I know . <P> UPTON SINCLAIR <P> Pasadena , Calif . <P> Learned Subscriber Sinclair to the contrary , TIME understands that the medical profession recognizes no one cause for cancer , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copy <P> Sirs : <P> I am returning my current copy for the reason that it is not properly put together and some of the pages are missing I am so appreciative of everything that is contained in the magazine each week that I am afraid I may be missing something good if I do not have all . <P> Please send me a complete magazine by return mail . <P> J.
