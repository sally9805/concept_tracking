txt Premier Lloyd George is " morally certain " that his next Christmas will be spent in Washington . Those were the words used today by a member of the Prime Minister 's entourage to describe his outlook on the corelated situation created by the arms parley . ' and the Irish negotiations . Lloyd George has received so many messages , both from this side and from America , urging that he should go to Washington that he has gone so far as to book his passage by the Aquitania next Saturday . The Prime Minister 's hopefulness is based on the conviction that only a negligible quantity of the people either in England or Ireland want the Irish negotiations to break down . It is agreed that the statement which Sir James Craig will read before the Ulster Parliament on Tuesday next will leave the door open for a continuance of the negotiations upon new lines . if it is found that agreement can not be reached along the lines that have so far been explored . The political correspondent of The Sunday Times says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George will sail Saturday next , but . at ' any rate his departure will not be delayed till the following week so that he will be in Washington by the middle of December at the lated . No date can be fixed for his return , but it is probable that he will sail again early in the new year so as to reach home in time to discuss with his Cabinet the program of the new Parliamentary session . " Ill as the Prime Minister can be spared from Downing Street while the Irish negotiations are still in mid-channel and their - late uncertain , the turn that has been given to the discussions at Washington renders it imperative that he should cross the Atlantic without delay if the conference is not to peter out ingloriously . " I have reason to believe that no one is more convinced of the necessity of his presence than the American authorities , though they may candidly recognize that he will be a , more formidable watchdog of British interests than either Balfour or his colleagues . " It has been borne in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sendoff that the conference received in Mr. Hughes 's speech , its opportunities have been not a little frittered away by lack of experience in handling international matters , and they are looking to the British Prime Minister with his prestige and popularity to pilot them through the shallows they have reached . " If it 's done , then ' t were well it were done quickly , and Lloyd George will not stand on his going . " The Sunday Observer says : " Publicly and privately the Prime Minister is besieged to go to Washing:on . We are convinced he ought to take up his mind and risk it . The domestic situation is not easy , but when ; an he count upon a time when that ilea will , not be urged ? He would find he country still in existence upon his return . " The King 's Government would have o carry on in his absence , and  --  the ; hole Administration would work beter if he delegated more responsibility D his colleagues . " Considering every contingency of the ear future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George should lake the personal acquaintance of Pres. lent Harding and Secretary Hughes , nd should have the straightest converitions with them . The disappointments f the Irish question make this not less esirable than before , but far more so . le believe that if the Prime Minister ddressed a few American meetings , ) th on Ireland and the general needs ! the world , he would leave a good ad meniorable impression , " The inevitable meetiog with Briand ould be much better postponed until ! ter his American visit . Anglo-French dations are at so grave a point that aria ought to have time to think and eigh all considerations before the fate ' the , Entente is brought to the final sue . To be or not to be is unmistak ) ly the question now . It may prove at France has taken the bit between : r teeth . " Briand , before leaving Washington , dulged in strange wit at the expense Britain and Italy alike in a manner which at the same time embarrasses ery American purpose . He remarked at , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France must have bmarines to examine the flora at the atom of the sea . He might have reembered that France would have gone the bottom if it had not been for ' Wilk capital ships . The offense to tly was gr , . ver and more wanton . "
