An active figure , with two eyes peering through large glasses emerged from the door at the left of the platform . He advanced to the centre in front of the expectant orchestra and bowed to the audience . The audience assembled in Carnegie Hall , Manhattan , applauded loudly . The conductor turned to the orchestra-it was the Philharmonic Orchestra . He was new to it and to the audience . He stood poised , at once elastic and tense , as if he were restraining a great passion . <P> The orchestra glanced at their music , Song of the Volga Boatmen , scored for wind instruments and percussion , poised their instruments , as their eyes turned on the conductor . His baton twitched . " Boom " went the bass-drum in answer . It answered again and again , its portentious stroke punctuating the strains of the Boat Song , composed by Stravinsky , conducted by Stravinsky . <P> It was his first appearance in the U. S. After a voyage hither which , he said , made him feel like writing a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole time than a 20-franc piece , " he had received pressmen in his hotel . . They had seen him disembark from his ice-blistered vessel in a black topcoat , orange shirt , orange muffler , monocle in right eye , but were somewhat abashed to find that his lounging costume consisted of a brown-and-rose pullover sweater , heavy gold bands on each wrist to support watch , bangles , etc. , and five massive rings . As he talked , he fidgeted . His glass had kept dropping from its bed between the fold of his brow and the pouch of his eye . He waved long arms , discussed his music in French and German . <P> " A modernist ? But no , I am not a modernist . That is a debauched term ( mot compromis ) . The modernists set out to shock the bourgeoisie , and they only succeed in pleasing the Bolsheviki . My music is neither ' futurist ' nor ' passist , ' but the music of today . " <P> The music , however , that he conducted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , the music which had made him so famous was , for him , the music of yesterday . Yet there were not a few in the great assemblage who love still the loveliness he has forsworn ; and , though the members of the Philharmonic Orchestra seemed to weary of all his impetuous antics , to grow listless in sounding their horns and strings , these people applauded long the music of the old Stravinsky , by the new Stravinsky .
