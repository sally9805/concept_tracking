OCTAVIA-Margot Asquith , Countess of Oxford and Asquith-Stokes ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Story . In the midst of 50,000 acres of Scotch moorland stood Dunross , sufficient unto itself , indifferent to neighboring lairds of small intelligence and long lineage . Indifferent because the clannish Daventrys were a community in themselves . There were five children , besides the resident cousin , who at the age of fifteen was in love with Octavia , youngest daughter of the house . A professor , kindly young recluse , woos her with classical quotations , understands her adolescent enthusiasms , guides her voracious reading . Worldly Compton , 34 , gloating upon her 17 years of mobile beauty , coaches her proficient horsemanship , persuades her parents to send her to his friends of the English hunting world . <P> If Compton had thought so to win her , his calculations played him false . For Octavia 's intense vitality was quickly engrossed in pursuit of hounds on the scent . Debonair Lord Tilbury loaded her with flowers , declared his love . And a highly respected Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother to propose marriage . Octavia would make a fitting mistress to a world of vigorous horsemen . <P> But for all their vitality , theirs was an automatic existence . Octavia 's frivolous hostess damns them as staunch Tories who nevertheless know nothing and care nothing about politics : " No one down here reads or writes . They eat , sleep , buy and sell horses , walk to the stables and back , tap the thermometer , fuss over their top boots , put ammonia in their baths ; and such powers as they 've got of conversation are exercised upon their stud grooms . . . . " <P> The exception to the category was young Greville . Vacationing from arduous if undefined politico-humanitarian labors , he offered Octavia stimulating relief from the world of hounds and their masters . Relief developed quickly into greater emotion , and they were shortly whisked off on the conventional Riviera wedding trip . That Octavia detested the still-born placidity of the Riviera made more difficult the time-honored difficulties of early married adjustment . But , back in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her husband happily ever afterward . <P> The Significance . Because Author Asquith 's first novel contains more conversation than narrative , ecstatic critics are likening her to Jane Austen . But the light touch and the subtleties of the 19th century novelist are not Margot's-hers is rather a brilliant vivacity that springs from her myriad interests . Able horsewoman , her interest reflects itself in frequent contemplation of the technicalities of horseflesh . Scintillating conversationalist , her characters reflect the widely varied circle of her acquaintance . A liberal in politics , she tilts sharply at conservatism . And the result is a mass of entertaining material , done into novel-form to allow of romance - that other interest the author so frequenty avowed in her autobiography .
