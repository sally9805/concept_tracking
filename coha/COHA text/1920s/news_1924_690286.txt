txt - Nothing in the perplexing intlustrial ! situation is more unusual than the contrast between our two main agricultural problems . We have , on the one hand , the question how to restrict wheat production so as to keep the wheat market above pre-war prices ; on the other , the question how to increase the cotton crop , by overcoming weather and insect , damage , sufficiently . to bring down the  --  price of cotton to a level at which the textile trade can continue full operation . While the present price of wheat is actually less than what It repeatedly sold at during 1912 and 1911 , cotton brings nearly three times the prevalent pre-war price ; and each departure from the Present general range of prices ( which is about 50 per cent . above the 1914 average ) - has affected the country 's trade unfavorably . The relatively low price of wheat , a consequence partly of our own wartime increase in planted acreage but chiefly of Europe 's rapid increase of cultivated area since the war , necessarily curtails the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high price of cotton , being a result of actual shortage in the American yield , has I hardly benefited the producing district as a whole , where a great number of farms did not produce enough cotton to pay expenses . At the same time , it has created difficulties for the ' textile mills , many of which can not get prices for ' their finished goods high enough to warrant purchase of raw material at the present market . Last week 's " condition estimate " of the Government on the new cotton crop throws a curious sidelight on that industry . Its problem really dates back three or four- years . The cotton season of 1920 was fortunate and the yield very large . Whereas three to ' four million bales were usually reekloned on in the surplus carried over at the end of the season , more than nine million bales were left to be disposed of in the season of 1921 . The market went below 11 cents a pound , distinctly a " pre-war price . " The South met this situation by cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weevil pest spread more widely in the cotton , belt that season than ever before , and an actual 40 per cent . decrease in the harvest brought the smallest actual cotton yield in a quarter of a century . The nine million bales carried over from the preceding crop averted scarcity , but the season ended with ' a surplus of less than five million bales . Another deficient crop left only 2,500,000 bales last July , or less than the normal " carry-over . " The crop picked last Autumn had been Planted on the largest acreage ever known . But the weevil again spread destruction ; the yield , though slightly increased over the preceding year , wes more than two million bales short of the previous season 's actual consumption of American cotton , and no one knows whether more than a. nominal surplus will be carried into the new crop year . With the price of cotton kept down from an actual " famine figure " only I through drastic curtailment of cotton manufacture , last week 's Government estimate of the new crop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below that of a year ago and one of the lowest ever reported at this time . The acreage is probably 4 per scent . larger than ' last year 's , but the vital importance of a favorable season for production is evident . If conditions of the two past seasons ' were to be repeated , the textile trade would be ' greatly embarrassed ; for this time there will be no such carried-over surplus as in the past three seasons to make good a new crop below normal trade requirements . Weather conditions are beyond control : but the efforts of the cultivators , the cotton associations and the Government will be energetically directed to exterminating the weevil . If this could be effected , even the relatively low condition with which the crop has started might still leaVe an ample ' yield . The ' condition at this time in 1920 was lower than last week 's , yet the actual crop was above the normal average and three million bales above last season 's . The " campaign against the weevil " has ? been systematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of administering on 933 farms the poison which is fatal to the . insect pests . It has been ' equipped for:extension of its work this year by large cash contributions from members of the Cotton Exohange and from : concerns with interests in the South. , The Government 61.13 been similarly active . Last year , according to the Agricultural Depart ment 's report , it ' was-possible to treat the cotton plant- with the calcium arsenate preparation ? in less than 9 , per , cent . of the-planted- acreage ; the treatment , this season ought to be much more : extensive and systematic . That this will be necessary the department itself admitted last week in its statement that the weevil , although at present " less in evidence in most of the belt than last year , " is nevertheless rather generally prevalent and " more numerous than usual in Texas " ? not an- auspicious fact , since last season 's increase of a-million bales in the Texas cotton crop was all that prevented the total yield from falling below the preceding season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the real achievement must finally ' depend on the thoroughness and intelligence with which the cotton iplanter himself carries out the program .
