txt That the Secretary of the Treasury has increased the rates of interest . on the new offerings of certificates of indebtedness is not altogether a surprise to bankers . The banking element has maintained for several months that the rate on Government certificates should be higher than 4%% . When Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Lemngweli came to New York in March for a conference with bankers , he was apprised of money market conditions . At that time bankers pointed out that issues of Government bills at a 4%% rate , with the'discount rate at the ' Federal Reserve Bank 5% could not very well receive banking support . In spite of this advice the Treasury Department went ahead and offered a 12 months tax certificate bearing interest at 4%% , of which only approximately $200,000,000 were sold throughout the'country . This issue having been practically a failure a further issue of certificates , not acceptable in payment of taxes , was offered , bearing a like rate of interest , of which about $200,000,000 are estimated to have been sold . The new offering will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bearing interest from April 15 , 1920 . One series will be known as " Series F , 1920 " , payable July 15 , 1920 , with interest at 5% per annum . The other will be known as " Series G , 1920 " , payable on October 15 , 1920 , with interest at the rate of 53A% per annum . The combined issue will be for $250,000,000 or more . The Federal Reserve Banks are authorized to make ' allotments " in full " on all subscriptions . In previous official announcements the Treasury reserved the right to allot subscriptions in part , but all will he accepted on the two issues now offered . The new certificates do not bear circulation privileges and will not be accepted in payment of taxes . In other words , they are loan certificates , which it had been the hope of the Secretary of the Treasury to be able to dispense with in the future . It is believed that the conference of Federal Reserve Bank Governors , at Washington , last week , threw some light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance the rates of interest on the new offerings of Treasury bills . Secretary Houston laid the high rates on " recent changes in the situation " which ' has for some time caused Treasury officials to consider changes in their financial program . In banking quarters , it is pointed out that the Government could not very well expect to . continue selling 4%% Treasury bills to investors , while attractive industrial and railroad issues were . being . floated on a 7% basis . It is pointed out , however , that the ntw government certificates , with the increased rates of interest , present an attractive short term investment , and will undoubtedly be well taken.  --
