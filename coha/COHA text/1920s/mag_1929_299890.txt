It rained till the Churchill Downs track looked like a brown and olive swamp . The favorite flower of the East was Blue Larkspur , but Man O ' War 's gelded son Clyde Van Dusen won the race . The other Clyde Van Dusen , his trainer , nearly wept when he saw him come in . His owner , Broom Manufacturer Herbert P. Gardner , did not watch him because he was afraid of the excitement . His jockey , Linus ( " Pony " ) McAtee , who won the 1927 Derby on Whiskery , said " I knew it from the start . " More than 60,000 people watched the race , All of them got wet , but the cheers which greeted the gelding when two men staggered toward him with a flower horseshoe , seemed to stop the rain . <P> Jimmy Walker had a box but Manhattan had a police parade so Jimmy stayed at home . Walter J. Salmon , whose Dr. Freeland won the Preakness , was there and so was Publisher Paul Block , who arrived in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was greeted by Brother-Publisher Ralph Pulitzer . " Bath House " John Coughlin , owner of Karl Eitel who did not place , wore an apple-blossom shirt , necktie , hat band . Herbert Bayard Swope , just returned from England , got his red hair wet and Commander Paul V. McNutt of the American Legion had the crease rained out of his trousers .

Among governors were Kentucky 's Sampson , Tennessee 's Horton , Indiana 's Leslie , New Hampshire 's Tobey , Pennsylvania 's Fisher , Wisconsin 's Kohler .
