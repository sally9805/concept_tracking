Prices for raw sugar , after their recent sharp upturn , declined in a manner natural in such speculative movements . The refineries have followed the prices for raw sugar downwards by cutting the price of refined sugar in proportion . <P> The agitation by housewives and others for a boycott of sugar is claimed by its organizers to have been responsible for the decline . Yet , from the size and character of the " parade " attempted in Manhattan by Mayor Hylan 's committee of women , this seems doubtful indeed . Mrs. Louis R. Welzmiller , Deputy Commissioner of Markets , had announced that 25,000 would gather at the Municipal Building to march . Actually only about 75 showed up for the parade , and conspicuous among these were East Side Peddlers ' Asso- ciation pushcart operators , who attended in order to impress the public that sweet fruits afforded a satisfactory substitute for the products of the " Sugar Trust . " <P> The embattled housewives have interviewed and drawn statements from various authorities . Secretary Hoover expressed open sympathy for the proposed boycott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of an " obvious conspiracy in restraint of trade . " Earl D. Babst , President of the American Sugar Refiining Company , proved more diplomatic . After stating that he was " opposed to a boycott , to speculation and to hoarding , " he advised the housewives " not to rock the boat . " He pointed out that if sugar prices were artificially depressed in America now , tropical sugar might find a higher market abroad , with the result that later in the year " all the housewives will go rushing to the grocery store for sugar . If it is not there it will be their own fault . By a boycott they halt the normal flow to this country ! "
