Diplomacy-as so many diplomats so often assert-is a profession . Last week , like a clan of impeccable Harley Street physicians shuddering over the success of some popular " bone setter , " the established diplomatic practitioners of London winced anew at Charles Gates Dawes . Publicly , with hearty fist-bangs upon a London banquet table , the U. S. Ambassador had just rasped and barked : <P> " I am not a diplomatist ! ... As I know my own business best , I am going to try and do it in my own way . . . . Nobody needs to explain to me how to get along with the English ! I have met a lot of unsolicited advice about that , but I resent advice about how to get along with the English . ... I have got something to say ! What we want is a pact of complete friendship and trust between Britain and the U. S.. That is what I am trying to bring about ! " <P> Chipper as a grey squirrel among sleek black tabby cats , dynamic Guest-of-Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association of Great Britain &; Ireland-wearing a " tropic weave " grey business suit of hard , aggressive cut . Every other guest of consequence sweltered , of course , in correctest English morning clothes . The setting was hoar , historic Vintners ' Hall , built just after the Great Fire of London in 1666 , sombre , immemorial citadel of England 's solemn wine trade . To talk loudly or to refuse a cup of wine in such a place would be to most Englishmen utterly impossible . Yet soon the 2,000,000 readers of London 's Daily Mail learned that " ' Hell and Maria ' Dawes roared* as if he were on parade ground . While his audience sat silent , mesmerized , and almost embarrassed ... he shattered the ancient and peaceful atmosphere of Vintners ' Hall and kept Lord Derby and Lord Riddell ( who sat on either side of him ) dodging his crashing fists . " <P> Quite as unusual from the British point of view was Guest Dawes 's handling of the Vintners ' massy , golden wassail cup . Brimming with stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vintners ' Cup was supposed to be deeply quaffed in sociable succession , first by Toastmaster the sporting Earl of Derby , second by Ambassador Dawes , third by jovial Publisher-Peer Lord Riddell , finally by the company at large after suitable replenishments . But when Lord Derby had drunk ceremoniously and passed the cup , Teetotaler Dawes pursed his firm lips , brushed the Vintners ' chalice against them for less than a second , then swiftly passed it on to Baron Riddell .
