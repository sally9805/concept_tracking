txt // The question of fusibility is clearly one which has impor-tance in connection with this problem of magma origin , and it may well be of determinative value . Though we are without data concerning the range of fusibility of sand-stones , shales , and limestones , we are probably warranted in drawing some conclusions respecting their fusing points from those of the materials which constitute the chief con-stituent in each . Quartz , the principal constituent of sandstones , is when pure one of the most difficultly fusible substances which is known , since it melts in the neighborhood of 1700 ? C. , a value higher by several hundred degrees than any tempera-ture which has been obtained from volcanic lavas . Calcium carbonate , the basis of limestone , according to Boecke fuses at pressures above 110 atmospheres at 1289 ? C. Clay , the basis of shale and slate , has so large an importance in the industries that its fusibility properties are pretty well known . The most refractory clays known , which are of course low in fluxing impurities , having fusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the common types heated under dry conditions begin to fuse at about 1000 ? C. , and the range of their fusibility is about the same as that of actual lavas which reach the earth 's surface . Lava temperatures have been measured in volcanoes and found to range from about 970 ? C. to white heat ( 1500 ? C. ) , but the higher values appear to be , not the temperatures of the lava mass as a whole but those obtained where unstable gases are being liberated into the atmosphere through ori-fices and producing intense blowpiping effects . It is prob-able that the mass temperatures of lavas seldom go above 1200 ? C. There is another problem of much importance for which a ready solution is found upon this assumption that magma is produced by the fusion of shale . It has often been pointed out that a close relationship in composition , a so-called " consanguinity , " connects the lavas which are // erupted at localities widely distributed throughout a somewhat broad area . Within a neighboring province similar co-relationships may be established to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common marked difference setting them apart from the lavas of the province first mentioned or with those of other areas . Such provinces , within each of which one general type , or related types , of lava , or magma , is encountered , are commonly referred to as petrographic provinces of comagmatic regions . It has been customary to ascribe the affinities of the lavas within any province to the existence of a common subterranean lava reservoir , and the differences to lateral magmatic differentiation subsequent to the formation of the reservoir . Because of the wide extent of such provinces , the assumed magmatic differentiation in a lateral direction , where obviously gravity could play but a small role , has made a large demand upon the imagination . So soon as we account for the origin of magmas in the local fusion of shale , it becomes unnecessary to assume a common reser voir extending throughout the province , and the affinities and the differences as well which are observed to character ize the lavas of the different vents , are all alike explainable by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The differences have also been introduced by tide and shore current at the time of deposition. // A petrographic province characterized by soda rhyolites and situated in south central Wisconsin shows the relation-ships and the differences in composition which are brought out in the first of the following tables . When compared with the set of analyses of slate in the second table repre senting various localities within the Vermont-New York slate belt , it will appear how natural such relationships of composition would be upon the theory advanced . Upon the same scale the petrographic province and the slate belt are represented in the maps of Fig. 7 . CHAPTER IV THE ORIGIN OF POCKETS OF MOLTEN ROCK IT has been shown thatthe rigidity of the earth must be generally maintained today under conditions of internal temperature which locally at least and relatively near to the surface are sufficiently high for at least the aqueous fusion of rock . This rigidity is further assumed to exist in consequence of compression due to load , which compression within the very considerable limits to which tests have been carried raises enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It follows that though the rock temperature be sufficient to cause fusion under surface conditions of pressure , within the lithosphere rock will melt at those places only at which the load of superincumbent material has in some way been either wholly or partially lifted off ? the load must be at least partially supported without bearing upon the portion of the mass which is to pass into the fused condition . Our problem is , therefore , to examine : ( a ) the forces present and competent to produce such structures , as will lift the load above a shale formation and ( b ) the nature of the structures which they develop . It has been customary among geologists to regard the lithosphere as continually losing heat through radiation into the space about it ( so-called secular cooling ) and in consequence diminishing in volume . The outermost earth shell having long since adjusted itself to the temperatures immediately above it , it is the interior portion of the planet which is now shrinking , and the adjustments of the shell necessary to close in about its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce compressional stresses within the shell . 44 // The view thus expressed has in recent years been assailed by certain physicists who have set up the claim that sufficient heat is being evolved from emanations of radium to either partially or wholly offset the earth 's losses of heat through secular cooling . The geologist can afford to ignore this challenge of the physicist , since whatever may be the computed relative losses and gains in heat energy , there is testimony supplied from the study of earthquakes which is fortunately unequivocal and leaves the geologist no recourse but to conclude that the volume of the earth is today diminishing . Before taking up this evidence , it seems advisable to first state the ' case as revealed in vertical sections transverse to the strata . Deformations which take place in the process of mechanical adjustment within that portion of the lithosphere that is open to our inspection are of two kinds : namely , flexuring or folding , and block displacement or faulting . Quite obviously the first mentioned type of adjustment must , in and by itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are folded can not possibly cover as large an area as they did before folding had occurred . This is made clear by Fig. 8 , A and B. It has been estimated that in the folding of the Alps the area of sediments involved has been reduced to about one-sixth of its former width . It now must be considered in how far shrinking of area through flexuring of the strata may be offset by adjustments of block faulting within regions where folding has not taken place . Such adjustments may obviously be of any one of three types , since vertical planes , or those perpendicular to a spherical surface like that of the earth converge downward , and they may be so adjusted that the center of volume of the disturbed region has been moved ; a , farther away from the earth 's center , b , brought nearer to it , or , c , kept at the same distance as before . Exaggerating grossly the amount of curvature of the earth 's surface for the sake of demonstration , these three cases are illustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is obvious that they must correspond respectively to a net shrinking , to a net swelling , and to an unaltered volume of the earth during the adjustment , so far at least as the affected region alone is concerned . It should be pointed out , however , that compared to the changes in area which result from complex folding , the measure of these changes in area is relatively small . Now it is well known that the so-called " normal " type of block faulting on other than vertical planes is that repre-sented in Fig. 9 , in which the blocks must tend to express an extension of the surface , and without careful quantita-tive comparisons of the sum total of contraction within folded regions with the total " of expansion in block faulted regions ? a matter for the distant future , if it may indeed be considered a soluble problem ? we are forced to admit that from this angle the solution of the problem is now inde-terminate. // It is the investigation of earthquakes which has supplied us with an answer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today recognized that earthquakes are the manifestations of the frequent sudden adjustments of the earth 's surface portions to accumulating stresses within , and with each relief so obtained is brought about a larger or smaller change of form in the surface . The distribution of earthquakes shows that for the land area 's earthquakes occur chiefly where mountains are growing rearing their heads ? and where the surface is therefore generally considered to be expanding rather than contracting . Now the really surprising observation has been made that after the earthquake the surface has really contracted , other and neighboring portions of the surface having moved in and so permitted the original area to rise . For the present we shall consider alone the evidence ' of compression of the rocks , leaving that of the intruding increment of surface to be dealt with in a later chapter . A study carried out by the writer in 1908 of the nature of the damage done to all continuous lines of metal , such as rails , pipes , etc. , and the nature of the damage sustained by bridges within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result that these are always such as to indicate a compression of the surface . Rails and pipes are found to be uniformly buckled or , if parted , the dis placed ends of the fractured metal are in such positions as to indicate a shortening of the distance . Bridges indicate a reduction , and often a very large one , of the distance // between abutments , but with no corresponding extension indicated for the approaches upon either side ( see plates II-V ) . The universality of this observation without regard to direction within the area affected , and the general harmony of the results when tested out for a number of heavy earthquakes affecting widely separated regions , force us to the conclusion that compression is the dominant type of stress within the earth 's outer shell , and that this stress is cumulative , as is required by the doctrine of continued secular cooling of the interior of the earth planet . An important consequence of this constantompressional stress within the earth 's shell is that whenever the relief is obtained by a sudden series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy of the system , the stress is again almost instantly renewed and the vise-like compression is again set up before the blocks , thrown beyond their natural positions of equilibrium are able to return to that position . Such return can only be accomplished through numerous later adjustments in alternating directions , which have hence come to be known as earthquake after-shocks . We may now consider the adjustments which take place under each of the separate heads of block faulting and fold- 4 ing , as a consequence of which may arise areas of local relief from pressure such as are necessary to develop pockets of magma within the lithosphere . In the case of block faulting the denser massive strata tend to be thrown by the jolting movement beyond their position of equilibrium , just as does a pendulum when released from its extreme position . Within the upthrown blocks any heavy strata in a relatively high position , such as a lava capping or heavy limestone or sandstone members , will tend to separate from weak and relatively light underlying shale members and as a consequence be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // instantly closing in , however , the massive upper strata may in consequence be largely supported from the sides and so rest but a portion of their weight upon the shale below . Under these conditions fusion of the shale will take place , provided of course the rock temperature and the water content make this possible under the diminished pressure ( Fig. 10 ) . Either slow subsequent settlement of the upper member or a jolting return at the time of the earthquake after-shock , will account for the pressure from above resting upon the lava reservoir and tending to force its contents out to the surface along one of the , marginal faults , where it would of // course overflow the surface of a neighboring downthrown block ( Fig. 10 ) . In Iceland , in the high plateaus of Utah , in the Great Basin of the Western United States , and in the rift valleys df East Central Africa , there are numerous examples of vast outflows of lava which have taken place over downthrown blocks from marginal fissures . In the process of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or arch folds , with synclines , or trough folds . The former when composed of strong rocks , possess the preeminent competency of arched engineering structures to support heavy loads , provided the span of the arch is not too broad with reference to its height . To the uninitiated it will seem improbable that bodies nor mally so rigid as rock should be able to form folds at all , but that under loads in excess of its elastic limit a normally rigid body is susceptible of folding is well established and has been aptly illustrated in the experiments of Willis . Willis produced compositions from plaster of paris , bees-wax and Venice turpentine mixed in varying proportions , and these were shaped into layers of different degrees of rigidity so as to simulate rock strata . Laid along the floor of an iron tank like a series of strata , these layers could be compressed from the end by the use of a piston operated by a screw . Though the layers yielded by fracture when // compressed under the load of air pressure alone , they underwent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected to a load of shot equal to but five pounds per square inch . It was found in the experiments that the stronger layers ? those with larger proportions of plaster of paris in their composition ? were the ones which alone carried the compressive stresses after the manner of girders , and when the strong members had been placed above the weak ones ? simulating limestone above shale ? the relatively strong members lifted a portion of the load to form anticlines , whereupon the weaker shale members below the arches , in-stead of folding , were fractured just as though the load had not been present at all ( Fig. 11 ) . At a depth where the water content of the rocks and the rock temperature to gether supply a combination under which shale is sus ceptible of fusing at the reduced pressure , the conditions are met for the development of an anticline pocket , or fold pocket , of magma ( Fig. 12 ) . It is characteristic of anticlines that only in the early stages of their growth have they a symmetrical form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the active compressive force progressively steepens and eventually bends under the other and forms an under-turned anticline which tends to close up under the con52 EARTH EVOLUTION AND ITS FACIAL EXPRESSION tinued squeeze . Simultaneously the magma pocket under the continuing compression tends to be reduced in volume , and will be reduced provided any outlet can be found for the magma . ( See progressive sections of Fig. 13 . ) Discussion of the manner of producing the conduit through which magma rises to the earth 's surface will be deferred until after the gases of lavas have been considered . The process of compressing the lava pocket is simulated in the operation of the common form of bulb syringe from which the contents are expelled by compression within the palm of the hand . Thus we see that , as in the case of the already described magma chambers which may arise beneath the massive members of upthrown fault blocks , the process of formation and compression of the pocket supplies also a simple solution for that much mooted question of the cause of the rise of lava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in the foregoing that it is only in the earliest stage of a developing anticline , or arch fold , that its form is symmetrical , and this symmetrical and broadly open arch of the embryonic stage thus represents the in-itial response of the competent stratum in the direction of flexure by a local elevation of the load resting upon it . It is one of the aims , of this treatise to show on the basis of observations that in many , if not in most instances , the in-itial form of the anticline is not even a symmetrical arched ridge of strata , but rather a linear series of separated broad // domes which later become merged by growth into an arched ridge . The above described domes in the strata , enveloping a chamber of lava were first described from the Henry Mountains in Utah under the name of laccolites in a now classic monograph by Mr. G. K. Gilbert . This distinguished American geologist believed the laccolites to be the result of intrusions of magma coming up from below through an undiscovered conduit and at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to force the overlying layer into a dome without altering the position of the underlying stratum . The force responsible for the structure was thus made to be the expansive hydrostatic pressure of the intruding magma . Such structures have since been described in considerable numbers from districts within which the laccolites are generally found flanking the higher mountain ranges . Such examples are particularly numerous in the Rocky Mountain region , where they have been described in detail by some of the most competent of American geologists ; and especially by Dr. Whitman Cross , who has published an extended monograph upon them . All geologists , so far as the writer is aware , have held to the original view of Gilbert that the magma chamber of the laccolite represents an intrusion through a conduit underneath , and that the force which elevated the roof was the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the magma itself . From a somewhat comprehensive study of the literature of laccolites , the writer has been forced to adopt an entirely different viewpoint and to see in laccolites the initial efforts toward flexuring within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratum of weak shale . Under these conditions the competent stratum rises in domes and the shale migrates inward to be fused into a lava pocket as already pointed out ( see Figs. 11 and 12 ) . It is certainly a fact which calls for explanation on the // part of those who advocate an intrusive origin for laccolites , that with the remarkable simplicity of the structures and the excellent exposures in section , the supposed conduit feeders have never in a single case been discovered . Certain other considerations of the first importance which follow naturally from the opposed conceptions of laccolite origin , will be easily understood from inspection of Fig. 14 . According to Gilbert and his followers the stress condi tion within the roof strata , at least during the formation of the laccolite , should be that of tension , due to the expansive pressure of the magma which is invoked to explain the structure ; and we should therefore expect to see the roof member intersected by dykes and apophyses of magma . Under the view here advanced the condition of stress within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be compressional , since the roof is believed to represent the competent structure which carries the earth compression and is responsible for the formation of the laccolite . Fur thermore , an intrusion which is conceived to be so vigorous and impelling as to force up the upper series of strata in so remarkable a fashion , could hardly have failed to leave // some trace of its energy in a disturbed condition of the floor areas . Yet the . evidence is in the direction of a. generally undisturbed floor , and that keen observer who made so many of the first studies of laccolites , Mr. W. H. Holmes , was evidently greatly puzzled by these indications from his observations . He not only refers to it in his descriptions , but in his beautifully drawn sections he habitually represented the hypothetical feeding conduit as extremely narrow , possibly in part to account for the fact that he had in no case discovered it ( Fig. 15 ) . Other no less striking differences which characterize the two conceptions of origin , are brought out in the sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the // enclosures within the laccolite should be either of floor rock or of materials from still greater depths along the path of the conduit . Upon the author 's theory , rock enclosures within the magma should generally be of shale , and must in most cases have migrated centripetally from the sides . It may perhaps be possible to prove by comparative measurements that the shale formation within which the laccolite is formed increases in thickness as one goes out from the laccolite margins . A study of the literature ' of known laccolites has supplied the remarkable verification for our view of laccolite origin in , the fact that they appear only within shale members and quite generally beneath a competent member of limestone or massive sandstone ( Figs. 17 and 18 ) . The evidence for this must be left for presentation in another place . A very striking instance of an apparently early stage of laccolite formation , within which the shale has completed its migration into the dome but has been as yet but slightly fused is supplied by Holmes ' section of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 19 ) . A stage in the process not greatly different from this is apparently illustrated by the Sierra Abaja , some fifty miles east of the Henry Mountains in Utah . Of this occurrence Holmes says : " The shales are still found in all parts of the group caught up in a manner identical with that observed in el Late and Carriso mountains , and the low saddles be-tween the summits are invariably of these shales . " Cross , in commenting upon Holmes ' description , says , " This involves as a physical necessity the assimilation of shale by the magma , and such is plainly Holmes ' meaning , though not explicitly stated in this connection . " The Sierra La Sal of northeastern Utah the writer 's pre-liminary study on the ground has shown to be a composite laccolitie group with the shale mantling over the igneous // core and capping it in the high peaks . The indications of tension in the roof of sediment called for by the Gilbert the-ory are conspicuously lacking . Since laccolites pass by all intermediate gradations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sediments , it is obvious that the same theory of origin must to a larger or smaller extent find application to them , but the study has not yet been extended in that direction . The immense quantities of igneous rock which are found in the cores of recently elevated folded mountain ranges have apparently impressed ? amazed , rather ? every worker who has studied them . The general observation goes back into the early history of geology and was , in fact , one of the strong supports of the famous " elevation crater " theory of von Buch and von Humboldt in a day when intrusive and effusive igneous masses were lumped rather indiscriminately together . It will be remembered that according to this theory the mountains were pushed up on the back of the magma much as a blister is raised upon the body , and , like a blister , the mountain was supposed to be a mere skin filled out with liquid under pressure . Everyone will recall the Alps and the Carpathians with their cores of granite , but far more striking examples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coast Ranges of California , and the great Cordilleran system in South America . Steinmann 's generalized section across the Andes with each of the compressed anticlines filled out by a core of gran-odioritic or andesitic magma is reproduced in Fig. 20 . The // batholites of granodiorite and the laccolites of andesite are alike non-effusive rock , and they come into contact only with the Tithonian limestones and the Neocomian clays . Steinmann 's description is illuminating : " The age of the intrusive rocks is limited backward by the post-Cretaceous folding , forward by the young Tertiary , and it is proper to designate it in general as early or middle Tertiary , hence , younger than the principal period of folding . . . the space for the intrusive masses was essentially created by the folding itself . Neither the andesitic laccolites nor the batholitic granodiorites have made a place for themselves by melting it out in the folded range , but they obviously fill previously formed openings , which does not ex clude the possibility that it has afterward been somewhat extended . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of the ranges is occupied by an astounding volume of granitic batholites within the folds to which Lawson has forcibly drawn attention . Speaking of the preCretaceous Mesozoic revolution which produced the ranges , he says , " An essential feature of the revolution was the development of batholitic magmas which invaded the crust , replaced large portions of it , and eventually congealed as plutonic rock of a prevailingly acid character . " The development of the batholites , he adds , " followed or accompanied " the uplift . Describing the granitic cores of the eastern ranges of the Rocky Mountains , these have been rated by Van Hise as pre-Cambrian . Summarizing Hayden 's report , he says , " Each of the great ranges of the park are anticlinal axes with massive granite cores and gneissic granites inclining from each side in the form of ridges . " Strangely enough the overlying rock strata generally lack the basal conglomerate which we have every reason to suspect in them . The weakness of the argument that the granite cores of such ranges antedate in age the sediments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding of the range , has never been more forcibly put than by Sir Archibald Geikie in discussing the Wasatch Range with its granite core ? Writing as long ago as 1880 , he said : // " One would naturally expect that if a mass of strata 30,000 feet thick had been laid down against a steep slope of land , its component beds ought to be full of the fragments of that land . Each marginal belt , representing an old shore line , should be more or less conglomeratic ; at least there ought to be occasional zones of conglomerate , just as at the present day we have local gravel beaches on our shore . ... But not only have no pebbles of the Cottonwood granite been recorded as occurring in the overlying Paleozoic rocks , it is admitted that these rocks become metamorphosed as they approach the granite . The natural inference to be drawn from these facts , one might suppose , would be that the granite was later in date than the rocks overlying it . " In the Colorado-Wyoming region there is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its core of massive granite and all alike under a competent arch of the massive Jura-Trias limestone , which arch was elevated in late Cretaceous time ( Fig. 21 ) . When the subject of the sequence of these ranges has been considered in a later chapter , it will appear that there are obvious gradations from the laccolites of the Black Hills and Little Belt mountains to the elongated sweeping curves of the granite cores in the Bighorn and Laramie ranges . A question of considerable interest in connection with this theory of the origin of laccolites and their related bodies of igneous rock , is that of contact effects which ought to be looked for in the enclosing sediments . The theory of origin assigns a common temperature to both the shale which is fused and the sediments which remain unfused about its margins , and except insofar as the separation of gases from the forming magma accomplishes blowpiping effects , there seems to be no good reason why contact effects in the country rock such as belong to true intrusions should be looked for as a necessary condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known to every one that rocks do not under ordinary conditions , those with which we are familiar at the surface of the earth , yield to compressive stresses in excess of their strength by bending or folding , but rather by fracturing , that is , crushing . As long ago as 1878 the distinguished Swiss geologist Heim advanced the idea that the process of rock folding is restricted to a zone within the lithosphere below a depth of 5,000 metres , at which the load of the material above is assumed to close the rock pores and so prevent opening of fractures . It is obviously of prime importance for us to consider what depth , if any , is required for folding to occur and permit the formation of a fold pocket of magma beneath a competent stratum . The modern theory of a " zone of flow " separated from a higher " zone of fracture " by an intermediate " zone of fracture and flow " was in 1895 elaborated by Van Hise , who declared that even the strongest rocks , the ones which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or " flow , " at a depth of 10,000 metres or about 6 miles , though shale might be folded at a depth of only 500 metres . Van Hise 's statement was tersely made in the following words , " Rocks under less weight than their ultimate strength are in the zone of fracture , that is , when rocks under such conditions are deformed , they break and crevices small or great separate the broken parts . . .. Rocks buried to such depth that the weight of the superincumbent strata exceeds their ultimate strength are in the zone of plasticity and flowage . " Van Hise failed to realize that , unlike the test pieces which are subjected to crushing stresses in our engineering 63 // testing laboratories , rocks within the lithosphere are prevented from yielding by lateral expansion when compressed in a single direction , and as a consequence the data which he derived possess small value . With the use of powerful modern hydrostatic presses , Professor Frank D. Adams carried out experiments in 1912 to determine what pressures were necessary to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , cylinders which in the experiments had been first enclosed in nickel-steel collars and compressed from the ends . His results showed that the crushing strength of granite is under such conditions about seven times the usual figure given for it , and Adams reached the conclusion that " under the conditions of pressure and temperature which are believed to obtain within the earth 's crust , empty cavities may exist in granite to a depth of at least 11 miles . These may extend to still greater depths , and if filled with water , gas , or vapor will certainly do so . " King after a study of the data secured by Adams concluded , " It is also shown that as far as hydrostatic pressure in the earth 's crust is concerned , a small cavity at ordinary temperatures will remain open provided the depth does not exceed a value between 17.2 and 20.9 miles . " It has however been pointed out by Bridgman that in these earlier experiments of Adams the friction of the sides of the rock cylinders against the walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressive stress has been registered which is too large . Making use of a very ingenious device of his own invention which permits of true hydrostatic conditions of compression , Bridgman obtained values for the crushing strength of rock less than half those which had been obtained by Adams . In addition his studies demonstrated that stresses necessary to produce rupture under these conditions have no connection with any stresses and strains which may be introduced by crystalline structure . // Bridgman reached the conclusion that pores will exist in rocks under pressures such as should be expected to obtain at a depth of twelve miles below the surface , so that his results are in a general way confirmatory of those of Adams . He says : " The results of these collapsing tests make it extremely probable , however , that minute crevices , at least large enough for the percolation of liquids , exist in the stronger rocks , at depths corresponding to 6,000 or 7,000 kg/cm- ' , and possibly more . " His studies show also that the method of collapse of the cavities is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavity with the fragments . In later studies in this field Adams has shown that cylinders of limestone compressed from the ends and enclosed within a copper casing are able to withstand a pressure of nearly 150 tons to the square inch , whereas when tested in the ordinary way they fail at less than one-tenth or onetwentieth of that value-11,000 to 25,000 pounds to the square inch . Moreover , it was found that the tendency to lose rigidity and acquire plasticity is a function of the temperature , and if the experiments with granite may be regarded as a guide , Adams ' general figure for limestone should be divided by three if the temperature is taken as 550 ? C. or that assumed to obtain at a depth of fifteen miles . At ordinary temperatures limestone and granite give about the same values , but limestone is unsuited to experiments at higher temperatures because of its tendency to lose carbon dioxide even at moderate temperatures . There are almost insuperable objections in the way of assuming that rocks are susceptible of folding only when at depths of 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every angular unconformity with its lower series of folded rocks separated by an erosional surface from overlying unfolded layers , must upon this hypothesis carry the implication that , subsequent to the deposition of the lower series , it was by a transgression of the sea buried by no less than 12 to 15 miles of sediments , and then by a regression of the // sea of equal measure raised 12-15 miles before being eroded . Such an assumption is of course too preposterous to be seriously entertained , though it clearly follows if we admit that rock folding can alone take place at depths below 12 to 15 miles . It must be clear that the factor which has not received due consideration is that of time , which can not be brought into our experiments . Elasticity and plasticity are in a sense reciprocal terms , since the former property measures the tendency to yield by fracture under excessive loads , whereas the latter measures the tendency to yield by change of figure , as in folding , under the ' action of the same stresses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it resists any deforming force , diminishes with the time such forces are in operation , and for each substance there is a specific factor to measure this called the relaxation time . For steel and for most strong rocks , which are very elastic , this relaxation time is perhaps measured in centuries . The relaxation time is apparently smaller the greater the force and the higher the temperature . Glass at 300 ? C. has a relaxation time of the order of a day . Any observing and thoughtful person who has strolled through an old graveyard must have been impressed by the illustrations there furnished of the relaxation time of marble . Rectangular slabs of marble may be seen supported in horizontal position by stone posts at the four corners , and it must be clear that when erected these slabs , two inches ' or thereabouts in thickness , would have supported at their centers without sensible deflection a weight several times their own . Yet , after the lapse of centuries they are found bent under their own weight alone into a distinct trough fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lacking examples of folds which have been produced at or near the surface of the earth through tangential compression induced by a piston-like movement of an advancing glacier front . In such cases the // involvement of glacial materials ' within the folds produced , together with other evidence , identifies the agent clearly ( Fig. 23 , a and b ) . Also in connection with the process of faulting , a dragging or bending backward of the strata along the fault plane , is not an uncommon observation . At Put-In-Bay on South Bass Island in Lake Erie are found caves which are due to a local elevation of limestone strata to form domes , and subsequent release of the pressure from below has permitted the lower layers to settle back and leave caves of mushroom form as a result . In the largest of these , Perry 's Cave , one of the roof strata is for a portion of the distance still in its earlier domed position , though the remaining portion has settled down and again lies horizontally along the floor of the cavern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slab enclosed in a sandstone casing in one of the Scottish graveyards , which slab has become so bent , that an arm can he inserted behind it . A stone door , jamb in the Alhambra of Granada has taken on a strong curvature from load . All these examples , and others that might be mentioned , clearly indicate that bending of rock strata can take place within very moderate time intervals even when the rocks are not sustaining a heavy load . f Who will venture to predict what amount of bending would occur under the loads which rock sustains at the depth of a mile or more within the earth 's shell during the same period , or by what factor this should be multiplied to apply to periods measured in thousands , or even millions , of years . Compared with these periods of continued operation of stresses , the times employed by Adams in his experiments are so small as to be almost negligible . It would lead us too far to assemble here all the reasons why any such figure as a depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone of folding is untenable . It will be sufficient if we can show that rock folding is going on today at much higher levels and even at the earth 's surface itself . A strong light is thrown upon this problem by the tiltings of reefs in the islands of the coral seas , such as those of Malaysia and Australasia particularly . These recent formations , originally laid down in horizontal position , have since been elevated and simultaneously bent into the forms of folds . In the sections of Fig. 24 the elevated reefs are marked by the letter with in some instances the relative age of the reefs brought out by a numerical figure which is the higher the later the formation of . the reef . The eminent group of Dutch geologists who have devoted their attention to a study of the structure within the island // arcs of Malaysia and the Moluccas have made most impor-tant contributions to this subject by bringing out the suc-cessive steps in the process of anticline formation within the surface rock formations of the islands .

Brouwer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical movements of the strata and shown that succesive positions of the strata during anticline development are represented by PABQ and P'A'B'Q ' in Fig. 25 , in which NZ is the level of the sea . THe curves represented are just those which correspond to successive stages of growing anticlines on the basis both of field observations in mountain districts and of the results of experiment . To indicate in what manner the coral growths betray such movements , we have added the diagrams of Fig. 26 . An upward motion of the shore will obviously result in successive elevated reef terraces , whereas a movement in the opposite direction will result under favorable conditions in the formation of barrier reefs or atolls . Though anticlines develop even at the earth 's surface , and doubtless in periods much shorter than those which geol-ogists are accustomed to admit , it none the less seems prob-able that the process of folding is greatly facilitated at sive positions of the strata during anticline development are represented by PABQ and P'A'B'Q ' in Fig. 25 , in which NZ is the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspond to successive stages of growing anticlines on the basis both of field observations in mountain districts and of the results of experiment . To indicate in what manner the coral growths betray such movements , we // greater depths where load must be a factor of importance . Expressed technically , the relaxation time is reduced with depth , and the rock rendered so much the more plastic . In some such sense the basal idea , of the zone of flow may per haps be retained . In any case it can only be at a depth suffi cient for rock fusion that pockets of magma could form be neath competent arches in the manner already set forth in preceding chapters . CHAPTER VI THE VAPORS AND GASES OF LAVA In practically constant association with the magma that reaches the earth 's surface are gases and vapors generally in large volume , and their liberation into the atmosphere with explosive combination and oxidation supply at least most of the energy which serves to make volcanic eruptions among the most awe-inspiring of natural phenomena . Not all the vapors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being held in the vesicles of the lava ; other portions react upon the rock or they collect upon it as solid sublimates . These latter can usually be driven off by strongly heating the rock , by which they often undergo reactions . The gases and vapors which together issue from an active volcanic crater , have long been believed to be in largest part water , either in the form of superheated gas or of vapor ; but with the water is usually associated one or more of the gases hydrogen , carbon monoxide , methane , chlorine , and sulphur dioxide . Recent studies would indicate that relative to the water vapor the admixed gases play a larger role than has generally been supposed to be the case . In the process of release into the atmosphere , those gases which can unite either with their associates or with atmospheric oxygen , do so and thus furnish much of the energy of crater explosions . Hydrogen burns to form water vapor , the carbon monoxide oxidizes to carbon dioxide , and any sulphur to sulphur dioxide and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with free chlorine giving hydrochloric acid gas . The " steam " and " smoke " which are so often described 72 // in connection with every active volcano , even during its periods of relative repose which separate grander eruptions , is now recognized to be a mixture of steam with fine fragments of lava . This " smoke " may be either white , gray , or black , the depth of the shade indicating the proportion of admixed volcanic " ash . " Quite recently Brun has set up the thesis that no water vapor , or at most very little , is present in volcanic emanations ; the white color of the cloud above craters being in his belief due , not to aqueous vapor , but to ammonium chloride or other fumes . This challenge of Brun to volcanologists , supported as it has been by extended examinations of active volcanoes and by his own laboratory experiments , has had the effect of bringing out new investigations by both geologists and geophysicists , notably those of Gautier and of Day and Shepherd . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the statements of Brun must be modified though containing a large measure of truth . From the surface of the lava lake of Halemaumau in the crater of Kilauea , Day and Shepherd succeeded for the first time in drawing off the escaping vapors and gases through an iron tube and collecting them under such conditions as they believed precluded the possible admixture of atmospheric air . In the first fifteen minutes of the experiment 300 cubic centimeters of water were condensed in the tube . Later analysis showed the water to vary markedly in quantity , namely , from 18% to 90% by volume of the entire mixture . Later studies by Shepherd indicated , however , that these data were unreliable because of the admixture with atmospheric air . The conclusion which is reached concerning Kilauea at least , is that little water is present in the fumes over the crater with the exception of what has entered from the atmosphere within the crater itself . Thus those early but . keen observers , Green and Brigham , have been confirmed in their opinions . Like many // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with colder air , but without evidence of condensation such as would be necessary if it contained considerable proportions of steam . In the emanations from the quiet crater of Vesuvius three months and fifteen months respectively after the eruption of 1906 , Gautier found that the proportion of water vapor issuing from crevices ( fumaroles ) ranged from 62% to 78% of all the emanations . These fumarole emanations issued at temperatures varying from 250 ? to 300 ? C. At the higher temperatures at which gases and vapors are found in association with lava , they must be largely in a dissociated condition , and such condition harmonizes with what we now know of the behavior of these gases . Chief among the dissociations which must take place , is a large one of water vapor into its components hydrogen and oxygen , and in the gases issuing from low temperature fumaroles , such as are found in the craters of volcanoes during the periods between eruptions or at more distant points during an eruption , the content of hydrogen is relatively small or even nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hydrogen , methane , and carbon monoxide are found in the higher temperature emanations from near the molten lava , carbon dioxide is correspondingly abundant in the more distant low temperature emanations . Water when heated by itself is properly regarded as an exceedingly stable substance and suffers less than 2% of dissociation at temperatures even up to 2000 ? C. Heated in contact with igneous rocks , however , at temperatures at or above red heat , it undergoes large dissociation , particularly , it would seem , whenever substances are present to unite with the nascent oxygen set free . Gautier has shown that iron silicates when heated to redness in a current of steam yield a gas which contains no less than 65% of hydrogen . It is doubtless because of ready oxidation by the nascent oxygen thus set free by dissociation , that oxygen // gas is one of the least abundant of those found in volcanic emanations , and that methane and hydrogen sulphide are also sometimes present to indicate a strongly reducing condition within the gaseous mixture . It is an inheritance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior for the earth , that the gases of lavas , with the exception of water vapor , are so generally believed to be emitted from the molten interior . These gases are assumed to have been absorbed with the condensation of the planet from its vaporous nebula . The great Viennese geologist , Eduard Suess , who held to this view , wrote of it , " Just as molten iron absorbs extremely large quantities of gas , and gives them off again as it cools , so the globe of the earth once absorbed extremely large quantities of gas , which it is now still continuing to emit . " He says further , " Just as there is juvenile hydrogen , so there is juvenile chlorine , fluorine , arsenic , carbon , and a series of other elements , all emitted by volcanoes . " The name " juvenile " is still widely used for such gases as are assumed to be derived from the original earth interior , though it must be obvious that after discarding the notion of a molten earth core , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their liberation must be taken up de novo . The large volume of water vapor given off at volcanic vents , was for a long time explained by assuming that ocean water in some way finds a passage to the molten magma in the subterranean reservoir , and the localization of vol-I canic vents either upon islands of the sea or close to its borders has seemed to lend color to this view . As we are to see , this arrangement of the vents finds another explanation more in harmony with our present knowledge of the earth . It must now be our purpose to see whether the gases and vapors characteristic of lava emanations or occluded in consolidated igneous rock , are satisfactorily accounted for on // the theory of the origin of lava in the local fusion of shale to form a pocket , and the ascent of the resulting magma to the surface through the superincumbent rock cover . Omitting the eight principal constituents of shale which have already been considered in their close relation to the corresponding constituents in the average igneous rock , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but yet of large significance . In the analysis made from a composite of 78 shales , an analysis carried out in the laboratory of the United States Geological Survey , the fol lowing proportions of these accessory constituents were obtained : It is not necessary to assume that the sulphur was present in the shale in the form of the oxide , since it is far more probable that this is present in combination with iron as pyrite , iron disulphide . It has already been pointed out that when in contact with rock at a temperature even as low as red heat , water is to a very large extent ( 65% ) dissociated into its gaseous components , hydrogen and oxygen . The carbon dioxide at higher temperatures dissociates into carbon monoxide and oxygen . Oxygen from either of these sources in its nascent condition will readily unite as opportunity arises with the organic carbon , with sulphur , and with any sodium which has been set free from sodium chloride . In its ascent toward the surface with the magma , the volume of CO and CO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcareous sediments which are assimilated , and this will take place particularly under the reduced pressures within the last one thousand feet before reaching the earth 's surface . Chlorine will come into the gases through dissociation of any sodium chloride encountered by the magma en route , and the sulphur will be augmented by the breakdown of salts of sulphur such as are admixed with sodium chloride in sea , and desert salts . It has already been pointed out in an earlier chapter that a comparison of the composition of rocks which are of relatively deep-seated- consolidation within the earth 's outer shell , with those which arrived near to or at the surface , shows apparently in the latter group an increase of the bases oxide of lime and oxide of sodium , which would result from such assimilation of carbonates and chlorides as has been described . The combination of free oxygen with sulphur , carbon , sodium and other elements probably explains why oxygen is among the rarest of the gases emitted from lavas and why these have so generally a reducing character . Few geologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable assimilation of country rock goes on in connection with the movement of magma , Loewinson-Lessing , Daly and Sederholm being exceptions to the rather general rule . It is pertinent now to inquire what the observations of geologists tell us concerning the manner of opening up a conduit through which magma contained in a subterranean chamber may be conducted to the earth 's surface . It was the belief of Suess that in few cases does this take place through a fissure , but rather after the manner described by Daly , in which the gases issuing from the magma near its upper surface are there permitted to unite and so develop heat after the manner of a blowpipe . He says , " Owing to their high temperature they melt and stope their way through the overlying rocks , and thus force their way u EARTH EVOLUTION AND ITS FACIAL EXPRESSION wards . " Elsewhere he has described the process as not unlike that by which a red-hot iron makes its way upward through a board . Barrell and Daly have developed this process of overhead stoping in special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of that name in use by miners . The hot gases fuse and assimilate portions of the roof-rock near pre-existing fissures and eventually quarry away blocks which , once detached from the roof , tend to founder in the magma . The source of the nitrogen which is generally sparingly present in magmas , though sometimes in large amount , has generally been attributed to admixture of atmospheric air . In cases where air is excluded , its origin must be sought in the air which is held in solution in the underground water of surface origin and involved in the lava during its rise to the surface . Such nitrogen is usually found mixed with argon . Quite surprising was it therefore to find in the gases withdrawn from the lava lake of Kilauea , as first reported by Day and Shepherd , that analysis showed nitrogen quite free from argon comprising from 11% to 63% of the whole . Later studies yielded quite different results and ones much more easily explained . Argon is present in all samples which were tested and the nitrogen was found to range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaggar , whose studies carried out through a decade of painstaking observations from his station at Kilauea have yielded such rich results , has shown that air is drawn into the lava column of Halemaumau as though in a furnace , and that it plays a large role in supplying the energy of the eruptive forces . Those gases which are not expelled from the lava at the time of its eruption are locked up in the congealed mass . These are liberated when the rock is heated sufficiently . The many studies of gases which are driven off at high temperatures from igneous rocks , and notably those which // were made by R. T. Chamberlin , are quite striking in their similarity to those liberated by similar heating of sedimentary rocks and with many which are wholly uncon nected with volcanoes . This has led to the conviction that we are here dealing with materials absorbed from the atmosphere and found in a condition dependent chiefly on the process of expulsion . In summarizing , then , we see that the principal gases of lava ? water ( gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hydrochloric acid , chlorine , sulphur dioxide , and oxygen ? are all to be accounted for either by the materials already present in shale which by fusing may be considered to have produced the lava , or by accessions ? largely chlorine and sulphur ? which have been secured during the magma 's ascent to the earth 's surface . It is no doubt signifi-cant of this manner of origin for chlorine and sulphur , that of all the gases of lavas chlorine and sulphur in their dif ferent states of combination are the least constant in quan tity , both being frequently absent altogether though at other times present in large volume . On Mt . Vesuvius dur ing the waning stages of the great eruption of 1906 , Perret detected both hydrochloric and sulphuric acid . It has sometimes occurred after an eruption of Vesuvius that the solution of hydrochloric acid in rain-water has been of such strength as to destroy the vineyards upon the slopes . Sodium chloride in incrustations and in various sublima tions are found in the lava , and the iron in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of a surface coat of ferrous chloride which the uninitiated believe to be sulphur . Worcester in his report on the eruption of Taal in the Philippines on the 30th of January , 1911 , described a heavy precipitation of mud so strongly charged with sulphuric acid that the bodies of the natives who perished in it were found flayed by the acid . CHAPTER Y'II THE CHANGES OF FIGURE WHICH THE EARTH HAS PASSED THROUGH IT is only to the person looking out over the sea , or upon a vast plain , that an impression of the earth 's rotundity is received through the senses , and even under such circumstances it is only the discerning observer who gains any other impression than that of monotonous flatness . The eclipsing of the lower portion of distant objects seen over the bulging surface of the sea , especially . ships " hull down " on the horizon , is apt to give us our earliest clear impression of earth sphericity , though an even better demonstration is possible at such times as the profile of the earth is shadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the earth 's figure departs at all from a perfect sphere , the variation must be by extremely small amounts . Precise comparative measurements of the length of a degree of latitude along a meridian , made in the equatorial and near polar sectors of the earth , have nevertheless shown that the figure to which the lithosphere and its watery envelope approach is an ellipsoid of revolution or spheroid , whose polar diameter is shorter than its equatorial diameter by about 1/299th , a difference far too small to be appreciable to the eye upon any demonstration model having the same proportions . This flattening of the spheroid of the earth about its poles , which constitutes its oblateness , though small , must not for that reason be accounted as unimportant . As a matter of fact it is of the utmost significance as indicating that the earth 's rotational velocity was once much greater than it is today , for such greater velocity would have increased proportionately the centrifugal force 81 // and induced bulging in the equatorial region with corre sponding contraction at the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's figure from that of a perfect sphere toward an oblate spheroid , is not the only one which it has undergone . Of the same order , and of very nearly the same amount , are other departures from the spherical figure which are revealed by the size , shape and positions of the ocean basins on the one hand , and the continental platforms upon the other . The bottom of the greatest deep of the sea is about twelve miles nearer the earth 's center than the crest of Mt . Everest , the highest elevation upon the continents , and the geographic poles of the earth as a consequence of oblateness are on the average thirteen and one-half miles nearer the earth 's center than the average of points on the equator . The figure toward which the earth departs from the spheroid , as indicated by the distribution of land and sea , has often been described as a tetrahedron , though the state ment is almost grotesque when put in this blunt form . The tetrahedron is a solid body which has four equal plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and four // " solid " angles in each of which three edges ' or dihedral angles meet . Such a solid , or polyhedron , has obviously so little resemblance to the spheroid that to show the relationship it is far better to compare a modified tetrahedron with bulging faces and deeply truncated angles . When this is done ( Fig. 27 ) , we see that each face of the model represents a portion of the ' surface which comes nearest to the center of the figure , while opposite to such a face there is always a solid angle representing the part of the figure farthest away from its center of form . The edges in which the bulging faces meet , represent those parts of the surface which are farthest away from the center , excepting only the solid angles themselves in which these edges are united . If now we stand the model upon one of its truncated solid angles , so as to represent the great protuberance of the Antarctic continent , the opposite ( top ) face of the model will serve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its encircling rim of land in at least partial correspondence with the tetrahedral edges bounding this face of the figure ( Fig. 28 ) . The three remaining truncated solid angles all lie within this land rim and fall into rough // correspondence with three ancient land areas of the globe which have been characterized as its " shields " or " coigns . " These coigns are respectively an area surrounding Hud son 's Bay known as the " Laurentian or Canadian Shield , " one surrounding the Baltic Sea called the " Baltic Shield , " and a third in east-central Siberia referred to as the " Angara Shield . " These oldest known land areas of our planet con stitute the nuclei , to which later marginal land zones have been added in a very complex historical sequence to produce the present continents . There are several tests which may be applied to the litho-sphere to determine whether it may properly be regarded as departing in a significant , even if not in a large , measure from the ideal figure of the spheroid toward the modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is customary , the shallow sea floor borders of the con tinental shelves , these platforms include about one-third of the entire superficial area of the lithosphere , as against about one-half of the area which is included in the rela tively deep sea floor of the oceanic platform , the remaining portion being largely comprised within the continental slopes joining the two platforms . In each medial line of our tetrahedral figure ( Fig. 27 ) , the essentially antipodal contrasts characteristic of the figure are displayed . Thus , a , represents a short radius beneath a face of the figure , and b , a long radius beneath the opposite angle . For the lithosphere this antipodal relationship is well brought out by the distribution of land and water , or better by the dis tribution of the continental and ocean platforms . The con trast is greatest along the polar diameter where the basin of the Arctic is opposed to the high continent of the Antarctic . The other coigns of the earth are only less strikingly op-posed to the ocean basins , and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by the circuit of land about the Arctic , so we have the continuous zone of oceans , the so-called " south seas , " to represent the taperCHANGES // ing figure of the tetrahedron about its southern apex . In general it is true that if the finger be placed upon any portion of the continental platform as represented upon a correct model , a portion of the oceanic platform is found in the antipodal position . Corresponding to the three faces of the tetrahedron which converge toward the southern apex , upon the lithosphere we find the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans in roughly these positions , and all these oceans broaden progressively in the southerly direction until they unite . Inasmuch as the force of gravity at any point on the earth 's surface has a value inversely proportional to the distance through which it acts , with the earth 's mass concentrated at its center of form , the average value for the force of gravity for points within the southern hemisphere should be less than the average value within the northern hemisphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact demonstrated by investigations carried out with pendulums . The period of vibration of the " seconds " pendulum is a function of the local value of gravity , and when pendulum clocks are transported from the northern to the southern hemisphere , the length of the pendulum must be adjusted if they are to keep accurate time . We see , therefore , that however grotesque may appear the bald statement that the earth departs in its figure from a spheroid toward a tetrahedron , such an assertion expresses observed fact and not theory only . The absurdity would be to state that its figure is that of a tetrahedron . Its spheroidal form we can easily and naturally account for by its rotation when in a more plastic condition than it is today and rotating more rapidly . All the planets are similarly spheroidal in figure , with varying degrees of oblateness which are believed to express differences in original rotational velocities . The degree in which oblateness expresses velocity of rotation may be visibly demonstrated by fixing a , wooden hoop at one point // of its rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stiff rod which forms the rotating axis to pass loosely through an aperture at the opposite point of the rim , so as to keep the position of the hoop vertical during its rotation though permitting it to move the free side of its ring upward . or downward in obedience to the varying centrifugal force . During rapid rotation the hoop appears as a spheroid and as the table rotates more and more rapidly the oblateness of the spheroid increases , only to fall off correspondingly as the velocity is diminished . But what is the explanation of the departure of the earth 's spheroid toward a tetrahedral figure ? The natural explanation is found , and so far as known the only one that has been offered , in a continued reduction of volume of the lithosphere which is believed to be the result of the earth 's secular cooling ? loss of internal heat to the surrounding space ? as has already been pointed out in the previous chapter . The sphere to which the earth 's spheroid so closely approximates is of all regular figures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume . Now the outer shell of the lithosphere must early have acquired an essentially stable temperature , whereas the interior portion , protected by its poorly conducting shell , lagged behind in the cooling process , and has apparently continued to lose heat throughout the geological ages continuing to the present time . The shell having thus acquired a fixed superficial area , has been compelled to undergo changes of figure in closing in upon its ever smaller core under the impelling force of gravitation . Now it is true that regular geometric figures have smaller volume for any given surface in proportion as they have few plane surfaces or faces , and the tetrahedron with its four faces represents the lower limit to this series , as the sphere with its infinite number of faces does the upper , for the reason that a lesser number of plane surfaces than four could not be made to enclose space . The solid series repreCHANGES // sented in sequence in fig. 29 from the sphere through bodies having respectively 48 , 24 , 12 , and 8 faces to the limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , though it must on no account be assumed that the earth has passed to its present tetrahedral tendency by the route represented . Experiments carried out with hollow spheres made from thin and flexible metal have demonstrated that these bodies deform toward a tetrahedron when reduction of their volume is brought about through exhaustion of the contained air . It is therefore no more unnatural to account for the departure of the earth 's figure toward a tetrahedron as a result of reduction of volume through secular cooling , than it is to explain the departure of the sphere toward the spheroidal figure by almost exactly the same amount due to an earlier higher temperature and higher rotational velocity . We might , perhaps , carry the subject of departures of the geoid from the spheroid of tetrahedral tendency , so as to take account of the fact that the disproportionate size of the Pacific involves a certain flattening of the spheroid in one plane parallel to its polar axis and give it somewhat the form of a potato , but the cause of this departure ' is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , of course , to be assumed that the earth spheroid , or geoid , underwent transformation toward the tetrahedron through any such series of figures as are represented in the progression of Fig. 29 . To learn in outline what the inter-mediate stages of earth physiognomy have been , we must consult the past history of the earth as revealed in the rocks themselves , the essential documents of geological history . // Geological thought , and indeed especially American geological thought , has in respect to theories of continental evolution undergone great transformations within recent years . Throughout the first third of the nineteenth century the ideas of the so-called " catastrophists " dominated the field , their view being that geological history had been punctuated by great catastrophes in which a seemingly quiet condition of earth forces permitting plant and animal life , had been suddenly interrupted by a world cataclysm in which great surface changes were brought about and all forms of life destroyed , after which plants and animals of new forms were created . The period in which these ideas prevailed was one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis formed the basis of earth history . In all Christian countries geologists labored diligently to bring their observations into literal harmony with the Scriptures , and those who dared openly to express opposing views suffered persecution for their independence . The appearance in the thirties of the last century of that masterpiece of geological writing , Sir Charles Lyell 's Prime ciples of Geology , marked the opening of a new era in which was brought about an entire transformation of geological thought . The fundamentally new conception at the basis of Lyell 's work was that the cataclysm which had been supposed to end the geological periods with destruction of life and creation of new forms , had no existence ; but that the conditions of the present are a key to the past as well . Such a change involved the principle of evolution of life as opposed to the idea of relatively sudden recreations of life following upon its destruction , and this new trend in geological thought antedated by some years the great period of change in the biological field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was , only natural that the pendulum of thought , swinging away from a revealed error , should be carried past the // correct norm to the very opposite side of the arc as a result of the rather extravagant claims for the slowness of geological processes , as opposed to the long approved suddenness of geological change . It will be pointed out in the succeeding chapter that different sections , of the earth 's surface now differ most widely in the rate at which geological change is taking place , and that in the British Isles such change is today very near to the minimum . It is therefore in no way surprising that Sir Charles Lyell , and his followers even to the present day , have continued to make drafts upon the bank of time for which to the writer there seems to be little warrant . The idea of a minimum of physical change in combination with a prodigious length of geological time was bolstered in America by the , foremost American geologist of his time , Professor James D. Dana , who set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have maintained essentially the positions they have today , a doctrine widely known and accepted as a fundamental tenet of the science , under the name " permanence of the ocean basins . " It was not until a half century after the appearance of Lyell 's masterpiece , which is generally regarded as giving date to the modern era in geological thinking , that the appearance of a work of the same dominating quality marked the beginning of the returning swing of the pendulum , not indeed back to the ideas of the catastrophists , but away from that of slow and moderate geological changes in the earth 's surface , which had been the essential element in Lyell 's " uniformitarianism . " This masterpiece was entitled Das Antlitz der Erde , The Face of the Earth , and was the work of Professor Eduard Suess of Vienna . In it he brought out arguments for the most profound transformations of the ocean basins and the continental platforms . Against the idea that the positions originally taken by the ocean basins had been maintained throughout geological history , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and distribution of life , faunal and floral geography , that across where today are great ocean basins there once stretched vast continents larger than any that exist today . The second largest of our oceans , the Atlantic , and the third largest , the Indian , were in middle geological time in large part continents . Professor Suess 's broad generalization concerning the main lines in earth physiognomy of the past as well as the present , will continue to stand out among the landmarks in the history of geological science . In the field of the biological sciences , the modifications of Darwin 's theory in the direction of recognition of muta tions , sudden changes in the evolution of species , has like-wise tended to the ascribing of somewhat less importance to the earlier view concerning the extreme slowness of de velopment of the new species of plants and animals . With this general introduction we shall now pass to a discussion of the outline of evolution in earth physiognomy in an attempt to determine through what transformations the spheroid of earlier planetary history has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has // already been drawn to the three ancient continents of the northern hemisphere which have been described as coigns or shields ? the Laurentian , Baltic , and Angara shields . In their earlier history they existed without the enveloping portions of the present-day continental platforms . Somewhat less clearly defined , perhaps in part because of the less advanced state of geological knowledge for the southern hemisphere , three ancient shields have been recognized to the southward of the equator , the Brazilian , African and Australian shields . In a broad way these southern shields took position similar to the northern ones in being somewhat evenly spaced in respect to longitude and in rough alignment as respects the northern and southern coigns . Thus at the conclusion of the first great geological era , the Eozoic , the earth physiognomy was , we have reason to be lieve , comparatively simple and somewhat as represented by figure 30 . Subsequent to the Eozoic era the coigns became enlarged by marginal growth , and after a series of changes which can not be here followed in detail , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in striking contrast both with that of the earlier era and with that of the present time . // Today the continents and the oceans may be described as elongated on north and south lines , if we have regard to the Caspian depression as an interrupted continuation of the basin of the Indian Ocean . Quite otherwise was the distribution at the close of the second great era of geological history , the Paleozoic , when the distribution was more on east and west lines . In the southern hemisphere a great continent which has been called Gondwana Land , stretched from South America eastward across Africa to Australia taking in the intervening ocean basins . Somewhat less continuously , apparently , the North Atlantic Ocean was bridged by land to form a real , as opposed to the mythical " Atlantis , " which may be referred to as Appalachia-Armorica ; and between the northern and southern con-tinents lay a dividing sea which has been named by Pro-fessor Suess the Sea of Tethys , the consort of oceans ( Fig. 31 ) . To express this aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tetrahedral leanings , we arrive at the form represented in figure 32 . Such a // figure with its reentrant equatorial girdle suggests the well known twin plane of a compound crystal , and it has therefore been denominated the twin plane . During the next geological era , the Mesozoic , there came about those profound changes which resulted in the foundering of all parts of the Gondwana continent except those which now remain in South America , Africa , Hindustall and Australia . Farther north the portions of Appala-chia-Armorica. , which separate North America from Europe , foundered to form the North Atlantic Ocean ; and to the eastward of the Mediterranean the Mesozoic geosyncline was elevated to form a great belt of mountains so lofty as to be referred to as the " roof of the world . " Thus was ushered in the earth of present-day aspect , the physiognomy of which is broadly outlined in Fig. 33 . CHAPTER VIII THE PRESENT REGIONS OF RAPID CHANGE WE have seen that the earth 's figure as shown by the changing distribution of land and sea has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that in the transformation from one figure to another the strains must obviously have been greatest within certain belts or zones which separate the sinking from the rising sectors . If such large-scale deformations have not altogether ceased , a question of absorbing interest is concerned with the place of their operation today . Now movements of the earth 's surface shell do not take place uniformly through a slow continuous warping only of the shell , as was so long believed ; but stresses which tend to produce movement are resisted until they have accumulated sufficiently to overcome the resistance , whereupon partial relief may be obtained through a jolting displacement and subsequent readjustments , which successive joltings are manifested to us as earthquakes and their " after-shocks . " In the distribution of earthquakes is to be found the locus of most pronounced earth movement today ? the zones of present maximum change in figure of the straining lithosphere . For the continental areas we have long known the position of the earthquake districts . Such visitations are too destructive of life and property not to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for the more thickly settled portions of the earth . As assembled by de Montessus de Ballore , these are given in the Mollweide projection in figure 34 . It is quite as important that we know the part of the sea-floor in these movements , hidden though it is beneath the hydrosphere . It is only 95 // during the present generation that methods have been perfected for exploring the bottom of the sea for earthquake adjustments , though some indication of the more mobile zones are supplied us in the location of earthquake seawaves , long erroneously referred to as " tidal waves . " Modern seismographs , or earthquake-registering instruments , set up in a coordinated system of earthquake stations properly distributed over the surface of the planet , now regularly record all sudden major movements of the lithosphere surface , quite independent of whether these occur at the bottom of the sea or upon a continent or island . The recorded centers of disturbed areas ? the so-called " epicenters " or " origins " ? assembled for a period of ten years ( 1899-1910 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of Fig. 35 . While furnishing a strik ing confirmation of the accuracy of the map derived from observations made on the ground within the earthquake districts of the continents , this map tells us further that the continental earthquake districts are extended outward for some distance upon the floor of the neighboring ocean , and that the measure of the disturbances is greater for the // undersea portion of the zone and for the belts of festooned archipelagos southeast of the Eurasian continent . If now we examine a modern atlas upon which the sea depths are indicated , it is at once discovered that the disturbed near-shore zones of the sea-bottom are characterized by generally narrow trough-like depressions with steep walls and with the shoreward wall generally continuous with the precipitous rising shore of the neighboring continent or island ( Fig. 36 ) . A section across trough-deep and risingshore together , and extended to include the rising moun-tain range which borders the shore , will generally be similar to one of those represented in Fig. 36 . It will hardly escape the reader who has followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjustments which are represented in these sections is exactly that developed in folding , and that the elongated trough or " fore-deep " represents a syncline , while the rising mountain range presents the associated anticline . That the development of the anticline is responsible for the formation of a pocket of magma beneath a competent // stratum at some proper depth is attested by the fringe of active volcanoes which almost invariably follows the back of the anticlinal ridges throughout the extent of these zones . For a portion of the belt these coordinated relationships are brought out in Fig. 37 , but a good modern atlas , such , for example , as Andree 's , will supply confirmation for the zones throughout . A study of the distribution of sedimentary rocks with reference to their age , tells us further that the belts of ex ceptional disturbance of the earth ? of the present-day zones of folding ? are situated just where there were narrow seas throughout the long preceding era of the Mesozoic , and j where in consequence sedimentation was practically con tinuous throughout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the geosynclines , of one era become the great moun tain systems of the next , and that these in turn are worn down by erosional processes to supply the sediments for a // later geosyncline . Thus is found a doubtless unintentional meaning for the scriptural language , " Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be brought low . " It will now be in line with the development of our sub ject , if we examine the shores which are being elevated into anticlines opposite the synclinal fore-deeps of the neigh-boring sea . To do this intelligently we must first take aecount of the way in which the shores are being shaped by the action of the sea itself . The sea exerts its influence directly upon the land areas adjacent chiefly at the times of the great storms ; and so much greater is the measure of its attack at the time of an exceptional tempest that by comparison all others pale into insignificance . At such times its energy is expended in drilling , battering , and pry ing away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its quiet level as it is able to throw its mass . Undercut at the base , the overhanging rock falls in blocks // which are themselves generally moved about and eventually broken up to form the sand of the neighboring beaches in the lee of the exposed headlands , or else it is transported by the powerful undertow to build seaward the gently sloping floor which is steadily invading the continent under the relentless attack of the waves . Though the size and corresponding power of waves depend both upon the intensity of the storm and , up to a certain limit , upon the expanse of sea over which the waves advance toward the shore , yet so broad are ' the larger oceans with respect to the diameter of storm areas , that it is doubtful if either shore of the continent has very greatly the advantage of the other in this respect . We ' may therefore consider that the rate of formation of a planed off-shore surface of marine erosion is about the same for the Atlantic as for the Pacific . Such surfaces of marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves , and with a stationary position of the shore as regards uplift they should be of their greatest width . The depth of the outer margin of a marine platform of degradation closely approximates to 200 metres ( 100 fathoms ) , which is about the length of the greatest storm waves of the ocean except within the southern seas . This wave length fixes the depth of the outer margin of the shelf , and it is therefore not surprising that on the borders ' of the Antarctic continent the waves of the southern seas have graded the continental shelf to a considerably greater depth . When we now compare the opposite coasts of the American continent , we find that they are strikingly different . On the map of Fig. 38 the submarine contours for the special depths of 200 meters and 2000 meters are represented , and together they show that the continental shelves which border the Atlantic coast of the continent are , rela tively wide , averaging not far from one hundred miles in breadth , whereas those of the Pacific coast are by contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate a relatively stationary position of the continent near this coast , thus confirming the observations assembled for earthquakes and set forth in Figs. 34 and 35 . The coasts about the Arctic ocean are bordered by broad shelves , and are likewise to be interpreted as indicating that the con tinental areas where they border this ocean are also relaTHE // tively immobile ( Fig. 39 ) , a fact confirmed by the earthquake map . Yet the sea waves have probably been doing their work quite as effectively on the Pacific coast as upon the Atlantic . What then has become of the surface planed by wave erosion ? The examination of almost any section of coast bordering the Pacific supplies the answer to this question . Sections of this surface have clearly been suddenly lifted out of the reach of the waves , where they may now be seen in a long succession in the form of a gigantic staircase ( fig. 40 ) . To make this more impressive , a few examples out of many have been brought together in fig. 41 . Each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meas ures the amount of the uplift of the coast either during one or a succession of earthquakes , although in but few cases can we as yet affix the exact date of this adjustment . Ex ceptionally such terraces can be dated , as in the case of one raised on the shore of Alaska during the earthquake of 1899 ( Fig. 42 ) . Such coast terraces as have been described for the borders of the Pacific Ocean reveal the fact that portions of the sea floor are being pushed up onto the continent , the testi mony of the abrasion surfaces which make the treads of the staircase being indubitable . This implies that a thrust from the sea . floor toward the continent is continually oper ating , but becomes effective only at intervals when the // potential energy of the system is let down at the time of an earthquake . This force would be adequately explained if the floor of the sea within a large area opposite the rising shore were settling downward and in consequence becoming reduced in area , as is required by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 ) . If now we inquire whether there is evidence that any large portion of the Pacific sea floor has been settling since the elevation of the mountains began on its borders , an answer is supplied for a large area by the study of the Polynesian islands and their coral reefs and atolls . Quite independently , Charles Darwin and James D. Dana , on the basis of extended personal examination offered the explana-tion of the low atolls within the Pacific , as a result of settlement by slow increments of former volcanic moun-tains . These at first emerged from the waves with fringTHE // ing reefs about them , but with progressive settlement became bordered by barrier reefs and , eventually , when the volcanic island had become entirely submerged , by the upwardly extended reef alone ? the atoll ? enclosing a lagoon . This view of the origin of coral islands has been assailed by several biologists , notably by Sir John Murray and Alexander Agassiz , who have offered a different ex-planation , but one which has not commended itself strongly to geologists ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn a considerable number of geologists to its support . The original theory of Darwin has recently received strong support in an extended series of studies by Professor W. M. Davis , and insofar as the question of subsidence is concerned it is also supported by Vaughan . Outside the zone of the tropical seas within which corals can grow , we are without direct evidence for sub sidence or elevation , but the landward direction of the out-ward thrust from the sea , floors seems in itself to offer us a proof of a reduction of surface within some neighboring region of the ocean floor . But , it will be said , the elevations of the mountains above the borders of the Pacific must just as clearly afford an in dication of extension of the earth 's surface wherever the // mountains are rising , as does the settlement of areas of sea-floor of surface contraction within those areas . There can be no denying the fact that the elevation of any belt on the earth 's surface with respect to any relatively fixed datum like the sea level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of the original surface , as indicated by the upper diagram of Fig. 44 . Such an expansion should be displayed through an extension of every continuous line of metal which crosses the district ; such , for example , as rails , pipe lines , etc . The effect will also be shown in the behavior of bridges , particularly railroad bridges , which are parts of a continuous metal line . Now , as has already been pointed out in an earlier chapter , the behavior of such structures at the time of earthquakes has offered us the surprising result that , instead of being pulled apart , they are squeezed together and variously buckled . This can only be interpreted to mean that the : area of the sea-floor which has been pushed up upon the continent and is in full view in the coastal staircase upon the ocean side of the mountains , has been more than sufficient in area to compensate for the necessary expansion of the zone by mountain elevation . The behavior of the rails and bridges indicates that with each uplift to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vise-like compression , and operating through a certain distance gains momentum which is effective in producing still greater compression ( lower diagram of Fig. 44 ) . // Only recently has it been pointed out that on the Atlantic coast of the United States there exist elevated coast ter-races , but of a character so different from those of the Pacific , that they have heretofore been overlooked . The reason for this appears in part to be that they have been so much longer above the sea and hence have been so pro foundly changed by the erosive processes that they can be recognized only upon the basis of precise measurements and elaborate synthetical studies . Credit is due to the late Professor Barren for having recognized this condition with-in the New England district , and his results , which were nearly ready for publication at the time of his death , have appeared in a series of posthumous articles . The terraces which border the Atlantic coast are also less easy to per ceive for the reason that the height of the risers is so small in comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been pointed out between the breadth of the eastern and western continental shelves of the continent , is thus shown to be continued upward in the uplifted sections of the earlier shelf ; and these latter // afford an even better measure of the comparative rates of uplift of the coasts , than has already been foreshadowed in the earthquake maps . From Fig. 45 , in which up to a level of about 1800 feet above tide the Atlantic terraces in New England and the Pacific terraces of San Clemente Island , California , are brought into comparison ; it may be seen that while the Pacific coast was being elevated to this height of about a third of a mile , the waves were able to cut inland a distance of only about three miles , whereas on the Atlantic coast the corresponding elevation of the coast was accomplished only after the waves had cut back the shore a distance of some fifty miles . To extend the comparison so as to include the entire uplift upon the Pacific coast , it might be necessary to employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which erosion has in part effaced the characteristic terrace contours . However , our comparison of the two sets of terraces has sufficed to confirm the clear indication of the earthquake maps that the zones of the earth which are now undergoing greatest change of position ? where the surface shell of the lithosphere is relatively active ? is the great border zone of the Pacific and a second great-circle zone which traverses the Mediterranean Sea of both America and Europe and is continued eastward along the course of the former Sea of Tethys ? the twin plane of the earlier lithosphere . The maximum of surface mobility // of our planet is to be found at the intersection of these two zones in the Moluccas of the Dutch East Indies ( see Fig. 35 ) . It would thus appear that when Sir Charles Lyell suc ceeded in overthrowing the then accepted doctrine of catastrophism ? calling for sudden and rapid geological changes ? and supplanting it in the science by his own doc trine of uniformitarianism ? supposed to demand almost in-credibly slow and gradual geological changes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects char acterize ' different portions of the earth 's surface . Lyell 's famous slogan , " The present is the key to the past " has come to mean " The present in Great Britain , an area of extremely slow change , is the key to the past . " The present rate of change in the region of the southern Andes or in New Zealand , but most of all in the archipelago of the Moluccas , has a very different meaning . Though Lyell had been a great traveller and had brought to public at tention the facts concerning a great earthquake in New Zealand , yet he was not impressed by it sufficiently to modify materially the form of his doctrine , modelled as it was upon conditions in Great Britain . CHAPTER IX THE CONTRASTED ASPECTS OF THE EARTH 'S FACE IN an early period of geological science before accurate maps had been prepared and before observational methods of study had been generally introduced , it was natural that the theories set up should have borne but small relation to the facts they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth century Leopold von Buch in Germany and Elie de Beaumont in France attempted to fix the age of mountain systems upon the basis of their directions or trends . Since it was no easy matter in the absence of observations to disprove the claims which they set up , and as both were men of great intellectual power and aggressive in leadership , their theories , wholly unsupported by fact as they were , dominated the field of thought of their time . With the passing from the stage of these dominating personalities , their theories came almost at once into discredit , and it is a direct result that attention was withdrawn from the plan of the earth and became concentrated upon perpendicular sections through the earth 's outer shell ( Fig. 46 ) . Such sections were constructed largely upon the basis of the observed attitudes of the hard rock strata at the various points where these emerge from beneath the unconsolidated materials generally forming the surface ; and being thus connected up with actual observations , sections contained a larger measure of truth than had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of effort toward increasing observation , proved a most salutary one for the time , and it was responsible for putting upon record a 111 // wealth of facts which alone could make broad generalizations of any value . While geologists were thus assembling the facts , geodesists and military and topographical engineers operating under the direction of national bureaus , were slowly extending the areas of surveyed territory , as they were steadily improving the quality of the maps which they produced . It has been only during the last quarter of the nineteenth century and subsequently that attention has once more been directed toward a study of the broad plan of the earth . This has come about very largely through the influence of Eduard Suess , whose masterful treatise , The Face of the Earth , is comparable in importance with Lyell 's Principles . Suess was the first to realize that the crude geological data which alone had been available a half century before , quite as much as the undeveloped methods of the time , had been responsible for the failures and for the illusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet with all his erudition and with a gift for beautiful and forceful presentation which has been seldom equalled , Suess was none the less poorly fitted to deal with the problems of mechanics of earth movements which constituted a vital element in his studies . However , his enormous prestige , like that of Laplace in another field , has carried some of his doubtful conclusions to rather general acceptance , at least in Europe , and without rigid tests having always been applied to them . Many of his large generalizations are destined to stand even when others less securely founded have been given up . Perhaps the most valuable of all the fundamental conclusions of Suess is his division of the earth 's continental areas into two sections , one characterized dominantly by folding structures which appear in the plan of the earth as great sweeping festoon series of mountain ranges , and the other in striking contrast as alternating plateau and plain // ? a mosaic of displaced earth blocks . The first of these is generally characteristic of the continent of Eurasia , and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat less clearly contrasted , these broad divisions were extended to the western hemisphere , the outer series of festoons of mountains on the eastern Asiatic coast being connected up through the Aleutian archipelago with the great Cordilleran mountain system which generally borders the Pacific coast of America . Another generalization of Professor Suess which is of the utmost importance relates to the coast lines on the borders of the two great oceans , the Pacific and the Atlantic . On both eastern and western coasts of the former there are mountain ranges markedly festooned in arrangement , and taking their trend parallel to the coast with their convex side always toward the sea . On the borders of the Atlantic , however , few ranges of mountains are to be found , and these instead of trending parallel with the coast , meet it at a large angle and are , in fact , abruptly terminated by it . Such Rias coasts , in the view of Suess , indicate that the adjoining oceanic basin has been dropped down along coastal fractures since the mountain ranges were formed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beneath the waters of the ocean . Professor Suess has given strong grounds for believing that the continuation of the Appalachian mountain system at the close of the long Paleozoic era , instead of being abruptly terminated at the east coast of Newfoundland , as it is today , took its course eastward across a now foundered portion of the continent to be continued in the eroded mountain system of identical age which under the names of Armorican and Variscan arcs may today be found in detached fragments stretching across western and central Europe ( Fig. 48 ) . The conclusion from all this has been , as already pointed out , that the Atlantic basin was formed by an inbreak dur ing Mesozoic time of the central portion of the former con tinent of which eastern North America and western Europe are the remnants . Within the area south of Angara land in eastern Siberia and extending eastward from the continent into the festoons of islands along the coast , as well as southeastward through Malaysia into Oceania so as to mantle toward the east and south the coign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welts which are primarily the result of an intense folding of strata . Faulting has also occurred , but it has // apparently been to a large extent incidental to the folding process . These Asiatic mountain welts are extended westward into southern Europe and extreme northwestern Africa as the ranges of the Caucasus , Carpathians , Alps , Apennines and Atlas ranges , together with the less definite ranges in the Balkan and Italian peninsulas . Looking eastward from Asia we find that the arcs of folded mountains trail off northward along the borders of the Pacific , first through the Aleutian arc and thence down through the long Cordilleran backbone of the western hemisphere to join up with an arcuate hook which projects out from the Antarctic continent to form Palmer Land or West Antarctica . In northern Europe between the Baltic shield and the southern European arcs extending northwestward to the Atlantic , as in North America , between the Laurentian coign and the northern Cordilleran system of the continent , we find areas which are much less easily classified . Within them are the eroded remnants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more remote in geological history that their plan is much less easily read . The main lines , however , we can still make out . The study of ancient geography has revealed clearly the fact that though the ocean basins have not generally been permanent , but have in the course of geological ages been profoundly transformed , the continental shelves with their shelf seas over which marine sediments have been laid down , have persisted throughout long ages as continuous floors of deposition , and that they have subsequently been elevated to form the great folded mountain systems of the earth . Such long marginal bands of marine sediments surrounding the earlier continental areas have been denominated geosynclines , and the best known of them belong to the early and the middle eras of earth history , the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic eras ( see Fig. 35 ) . The Paleozoic geosynclines were elevated into mountains // at the close of that era and are best known to us in the Appalachian ranges composed of folded beds which involve , as usually assumed , from 30,000 to 50,000 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era were zone 's of continuous sedimentation throughout Mesozoic time , at the conclusion of which they were similarly raised to form what are now the greatest mountains of the earth . They include the Himalayas with their associated ranges and extensions to the east and west across Eurasia , and the great Cordilleran system of the western continent . Thus the series of Mesozoic geosynclines marked out the course of the present great mountain systems , and they have undergone less subsequent change than have those mountains which were reared above the Paleozoic geosynclines , and their courses like their structures are ' so much the more easily followed . Confirmation of the view that the outermost and most recent welts of the Mesozoic geosynclines are still in process of erection , is supplied by the line of active volcanic vents which parallels the series and almost completely surrounds the ocean as the so-called " fire ring " or " fire girdle " of the Pacific ( see frontispiece ) . It is especially noteworthy in view of what has been said concerning the magma chambers ( see Chapter III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or back , side of the arcs away from the ocean . Upon the westward border of the Pacific the outermost series of welts , instead of resting upon the continent , rises from the depths of the sea , sometimes with other only less recent island arcs at its back , between it and the continent . In front of the outer series of island arcs , the sea bottom generally drops down into long and narrow troughs ? foretroughs ? running parallel to the arcs . Behind the island arcs are usually other deeps less profound and lacking the characteristically long and narrow trench form , and these we may call " back-deeps " rather than troughs ( Fig. 37 ) . Less strikingly trench-like also , somewhat similar deeps lie // either close in near the Pacific coast of North America or else as an intermontane valley upon the continent between a coast range and a cordillera at its back . Excepting only those Atlantic arcs which lie within the zone of the former twin plane extended in the Sea of Tethys , nothing at all resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic coast or , in fact , within the Atlantic basin . CHAPTER X THE MIGRATIONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE SURFACE IT has been pointed out in the last chapter that upon the Eurasian continent generally , as well as throughout the zone which extends around the Pacific Ocean , the earth 's face is traversed by a wealth of curving creases , whereas the continent of Africa presents a wholly different aspect . In the former region the surface expression of the relief is a result primarily of the process of folding , with faulting playing a generally secondary role ; whereas in the latter the surface configuration is largely a direct expression of the faulting process , and the result a pattern on first sight resembling perhaps a Chinese puzzle , but on closer examination the more regular design of marquetry . For the present it is the pattern of the mountain wrinkles within the folded regions which will engage our attention , and it is necessary first of all to rid ourselves of certain preconceived notions derived from our study of geography in the schools . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the character rather than the actual positions of the ranges is to be presented , as though they took their courses in a. sinuous or serpentine fashion . Most persons who have now reached maturity , and it is not intended to say how many others , think of mountain chains in terms of the appearance which these features made upon the maps of their school atlases , a or b of Fig. 49 ; whereas for nearly a generation those who have given intimate attention to the problems of mountain structure , know that mountain chains are really not sinuous , but scalloped , as schematically represented in c of Fig. 49 . Geologists and geographers are themselves largely to 119
