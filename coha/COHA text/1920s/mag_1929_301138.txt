One day in 1925 troubled directors of Trumbull Steel Co. sat around a table and wondered where they could get money enough to put their wavering company firmly on its feet . They had been sitting for a long time without finding a way out of their difficulties when , miraculously , a taL stranger walked into their sanctum , slapped down on the table a $20,000,000 check , said , " There is my letter of introduction . " <P> Thus did Cleveland 's Cyrus Stephen Eaton , a stranger to steel men , enter a business which was no less strange to him . Once in , he stayed in ; acquired a controlling interest in many another steel company ; created one of those vague but formidable entities known as an interest . Steel men , surveying the various steel companies included in the Eaton steel interests , began to predict a merger that would leave United States Steel and Bethlehem Steel no longer so pre-eminently first and second largest steel companies that the position of third largest carried with it only a statistical distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true in the formation of Republic Steel Co. , Eaton consolidation which , though still considerably smaller even than Bethlehem Steel , moved indisputably into the third position and contained the potentialities of a still larger company wth the possible addition of other Eaton companies as yet uncombined . <P> Constituents of Republic Steel Co. are Republic Iron &; Steel Co. , Central Alloy Steel Corp. , Donner Steel Co. , Inc. , Bourne-Fuller Co. , Trumbull Cliffs Furnace Co. and their subsidiaries . Outstanding statistics ( approximate ) : <P> Assets $350,000,000 <P> Sales $250,000,000 <P> Ingot capacity 5,000,000 tons <P> Republic Iron &; Steel is the keynote of the new structure . Organized in 1899 , from a merger of 24 small steel companies , chiefly in Ohio and Indiana , the company last year went through a rapid expansion program which included acquisition of Trumbull Steel Co. and Steel &; Tubes , Inc . There were also continuous but as yet unfulfilled rumors of a merger with Youngstown Sheet &; Tube Co. , in which Mr. Eaton is also interested . Republic Iron &; Steel showed a net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first nine months of 1929 . <P> Central Alloy Steel Corp . is the leading producer of steel alloys and is one of the several U. S. steel companies ' licensed by Germany 's Krupp Works to make the new nitralloy and nirosta ( stainless ) steels . The new Republic company is forming a subsidiary , Republic Research Co. , which will specialize in the development of alloy steels and will be headed by Frederick J. Griffiths , Central Alloy 's board chairman . <P> The Republic-Youngstown amalgamation , which has on several occasions appeared all but ratified , may yet be arranged , and Chicago 's Inland Steel Company , in which Mr. Eaton is heavily interested , is also a potential member of the combination . The Republic group at present lacks a rail-making member-a gap which Inland would fill . Present ranking of the leading steel companies is : <P> Ingot capac. ( tons ) <P> U. S.
