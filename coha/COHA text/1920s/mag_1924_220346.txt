An earthenware tablet , long buried in the Middle Eastern section of the Prussian State Museum , has been found to contain the musical notation for a religious hymn . This notation has been deciphered by Dr. Kurt Sachs , Curator of the Collection of Instruments at the Berlin High School for Music . The tablet comes from ancient Assur , capital of Assyria , and was inscribed in cuneiform characters about the year 800 B. C. It contains three columns : The first is the mysterious music ; the second , in archaic Sumerian , an account of the creation of Man from the blood of the gods ; the third , a translation of this into Assyrian . <P> Prof. Sachs first figured out what the ancient notes were called . Here are the first four lines he deciphered : ME ME KUR KUR A A A A A KU KU LU LU MASH MASH MASH MASH <P> Finally , he discovered the modern musical equivalent of each of these syllables . He concluded that the Assyrians , like the Chinese , had a scale consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that which is produced when one plays on only the black keys of a piano . The tune of this particular hymn turned out to be rather " Chinese " in character , monotonous and plaintive . It was played on a harp which had 21 strings and was probably very popular with the old priests and cutthroats of Assyria.
