txt President Harding is opposed to a bond issue , to the eight-joint taxation plan , formulate ed by the Ways and Means Committee , and to a re-enactment of recently ree pealed taxes as a means of raising money to pay a bonus to ex-service men . His position became known today , following a meeting of the Cabinet , at which the advisability of paying a bonne at this time , and the effect upon Government financing of such expenditure were discussed . It is said that the President and other members of the 7abinet expressed their views strongly on the subject , with the result that a rumor became current that the President might tell Congress that he was opposed to bonus legislation at present or might favor a limited final sales tax as a rave enue raiser . President Harding holds that It is not possible to raise by a bond issue the amount required for the bonus without injuring Government credit ; forcing up interest rates and hindering business ex -- pansion . It is his opinion that the Goveminent has right before it about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen months , it is recalled , the Government must refund some $6,500,000,000 in Victory notes and certificates of indebtedness . The President is opposed in general to any taxation that will burden induster , slowly reviving , and prevent capital go . lug into business enterprises . For that reason Mr. Harding objects to the eight ? point plan suggested by the Ways and Means Committee to obtain revenue for the bonuses , and is unalterably against the suggestion that the excess profit taxes and high income surtaxes , repealed in the recent tax bill , might be re-enacted . It was indicated at the White House that the President opposed bonus led " . laden last year because of the cepa . Won of the Treasury . This cendition ihas not become much better , but the President believes that public sentiment has changed somewhat and that it may be necessary for him to heed this if he can find any means of obtaining the money that is sane and defensible . There appears to he doubt in the President 's mind as to whether the time is yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary to raise the sum required for bonuses . Talk of Limited Sales Plan . With three proposed methods of bonus payment eliminated , the President is now seeking a plan that will be less di &; turbing to taxpayers and business . This will reach the Ways and Means Committee and the Finance Committee tomorrow in a letter which , it is said , will give the President 's views . The committee met this afternoon to receive the promised suggestion from the President . They learned the views of the President unofficially and discussed the situation informally . The President 's opposition to the eight ? point plan and the bond idea made the plight of bonus advocates worse than ever . Many members of the committee concluded that the President was inclined to support a sales tax as a less objectionable method of finding money for bonuses . Some who professed to . know his views declared that the President saw no objection to a limited tax on final sales which would exempt sales of farm products . On the other hand opponents of the bonus found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would finally come out for further postponement or abandonment of the bonus legislation . The committees remained in session more than an hour , hoping to get official word from the White House . Members became so restless that a Cabinet member was asked to explain the President 's attitude . This he did , declaring that he could not say whether the President had a formal suggestion to offer or intended putting upon Congress the sole reponsibility for raising the money . The demoralization among Republican leaders was increased by the President 's failure to support the bonus tax plans . Telegrams of protest against these tax ideas continue to flood the members . Many ex-service men were among the protestants . Most of the ex-service men registered their opposition to a special tax that might become known as the bonus tax and make the beneficiarlea unpopular . The Republican leaders frankly admitted that they are in a plight from which it was impossible to extricate themselves without political embarrassment . They do not hesitate to Bair that the party 's promises to reduce , taxes will not be fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party has , to all intents and purposes , promised a bonus. - The situation is one that can not be controlled by leaders who have hoped that the President mould assume the leadership and again counsel delay in granting bonuses . Unless the President does this there is every indication to . night that such legislation will be en ? acted within two months . It is absorbtrig almost the entire attention of those Members who face the primaries and the November elections . Even if the President should favor a small sales tax there would be strong opposition to it in the House and the Senate . Republican members , of the House went on record in caucus against meth a tax , and the opposition is now stronger among the farm bloc than it was a While ago . If sales of farm products were exempted , members of Congress from the East would be likely to oppose it as being class legislation . A Republican leader of the House , who is opposed to bonuses , said after canvassing the House today that sentiment there was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bill , no matter what kind of tax was proposed . He said that he was coming to the conclusion that the House would even accept a bill that provided no means for raising the money . Those Who favor this plan say that the money Could be raised by five-year Treasury Certificates and when business conditions became better taxes could be imposed to redeem the certificates . While the sentiment for the bonus is hot so strong in the Senate as in the House , there is no indication relatively that the opposition in the upper body %sill be powerful enough to defeat bonus legislation even if the President should refuse to recommend a plan for ** the money . Political exigencies , and not fiscal needs , are influencing many Members of Congress . " There will be a bonus bill , " said Representative Fordney late today . " It will be reported by the Ways and . Means Committee in ten days or it may be delayed . In my judgment , it will pass both houses of Congress . The time has come to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , and I believe a bill Will be passed in this session . "
