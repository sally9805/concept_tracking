While the . number of the former operating was decreased from twenty-five to fifty per cent. , they were able to keep up steam and production on a reduced scale . Insurgents Avoid Disorder . Fear of running afoul of State and Federal laws prompted the insurgents to begin what is actually a strike with the utmost care . No disorders of any sort were reported and no attempt was made to establish pickets or endeavor to turn back from work those who - wished to stand by the union organization and it 's leaders . Enoch Williams , who has led the insurgents for many months , directed air movements from his home in Taylor . State troopers and deputy sheriffs are in readiness if trouble occurs . Not a call reached the headauarters of either force today and for the present trouble is not expected , The sudden shutting off of the production is bound to ? cause ' an anthracite shortage , for operators said today that none of the companies have any coal in storage and that in recent months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for emergency .

Federal action will be taken to break the walkout . The insurgents believe they have avoided Government intervention by taking a , " vacation . " The union leaders are spreading broadcast the assertion that it is probable President Wilson will be induced to reopen the award . Thomas Kennedy , President of District No. 7 , and . one of the strongest leaders in the union make , today said : This whole situation is now in the President 's hands . If he follows the same course as he did in the bituminous controversy it will be very easy to establish peace . In the bituminous case the men were given a bigger increase than the anthracite then .

We railroaders also went on strike . If we continue on at present we must be defeated . There is one answer . There must be a combination of forces of the workers who are forced to strike . We are asking you to co-operate with us . With the miners and railroaders united there is no power on earth that can deny us a portion of that which we demand . We must get together for the first time in the history of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever got : ? a licking that will hereafter bring him to his knees in granting our demands .
