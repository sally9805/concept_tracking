txt Appeal for a Country Charity . You have been so successful In bringing before the public the " Neediest Cases " of New York City that I hope you will give space in your columns to this appeal for a very deserving charity in the country . The Ascension Farm School for Boys , located at South Mill in the Berkshires , was destroyed by fire on Sunday , Dec. 20 . Tile farm buildings Nero saved , but tile main school building , housing twenty-five boys and their guardians , was a total loss . It is the desire of the managers to rebuild at once , and upon broader foundations . The sum needed will be at least $22.000 . I am sure that .. those of your readers who have associations with the Berkshire Hills , and who know of the excellent work which has been modestly done by the Ascension Farm School in making fine , sett-supporting citizens out of boys from the city who have not had a chance , will not permit this opportunity-to go by without helping .
