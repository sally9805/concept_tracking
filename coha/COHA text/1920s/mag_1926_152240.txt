Two Methodist Episcopal conferences took place last week - the semi-annual conference of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church ( at Washington ) and the quadrennial conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South* ( at Memphis ) . <P> Methodist Episcopal . The bishops convene in semi-annual conference only as an administrative body and to hear reports . This time they heard that Bishop Anton Bast of Denmark could not join them because pardon or reprieve from his prison was refused ( TIME , March 29 ) ; that reports of Mexi can religious persecution were false ; that England lags in restricting liquor sales in India . The conference was calm . <P> Methodist Episcopal , South . The general conference is legislative and judicial . Last week the lay and clerical delegates hoped for a sedate session , but occasionally broke up into opinionated wrangles . An attempt to railroad through a stiff fundamentalist resolution caused the noisiest row . The resolution was pocketed in committee . Prohibition was approved , theatres damned . At one session the 2,000 delegates paused to pray that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> * John Wesley founded U. S. Methodism by his visit to Georgia in 1735 . In 1784 the Methodist Episcopal Church took form . In 1845 slave-owning Methodists of the South established the Methodist Episcopal Church , South . Although recent years have witnessed some comity between the two branches , regional prejudices have prevented unification . They exchanged fraternal greetings last week .
