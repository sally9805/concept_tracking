txt Probably no event in the motor industry will be more closely watched than the recent changes which have taken place in Dodge Bros. , Inc. , prices and management . Since the death of John and Horace Dodge in 1919 the company has been a peaceful giant among the other motor giants , tending to its own knitting and content to expand gradually , but now it has donned a new suit of armor and is making ready for conquest with the largest competitors in the field . Fred J. Haynes and his associates managed the property admirably , as trustees should , but there has now been added to the organization the tremendous force of ownermanagement in the form of the three Graham brothers . These young country boys are known as motor men of the keenest aptitude and skill . They have come up through factory and sales department much after the fashion - of the six Fisher brothers of Fisher Body Corp. , or , more pertinently , much as John and Horace Dodge developed from blacksmiths into builders of industry Just how greatly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not publicly known , but their interest is exceedingly large . Indeed , Detroit bankers believe that if they do not now actually hold control of the Dodge Bros. common B stock , they have an option on it . Graham brothers are shrinking violets when it comes to publicity , but there is nothing demure about their plans for the future of Dodge Bros. and its now closely allied Graham Brothers . DILLON INDLDES MERGER The story of how and why Clarence Dillon persuaded the Grahams to merge their business with Dodge Brothers and to take a dominating hand in the management will have to be told later , but the vigor and resolution with which they have turned the Dodge helm toward a new high star tokens plainly that they expect to write their names in huge letters on the record of motor vehicle history . it is a far cry from a plan to an achievement , but it is no secret that the Graham brothers expect to make third place in 1926 with an outturn of 400,000 vehicles . Hudson bested them in 1925 with 265,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose race in 1926 becausb Hudson plans 385,000 and the Hudson people have a habit of doing what they start out to do . Chevrolet with 518,030 in 1923 is ahead of Dodge and Hudson , but Chevrolet plans 600,000 in 1926. .. - TRREE STRONG sononrcons We have then three strong producers bidding for 150,000 , 115,000 and 85,000 , respectively , or an aggregate of 350,000 more cars in 1926 than in 1925 . It is obvious from even a casual study of production , registration and scrappage statistics that this number of cars can not be added to the 4,325,000 produced in 1925 and to the query : " Where will you get these sales ? " the answer is given , ? WFrom Henry Ford . " This situation should make 1926 one of the most interesting of all the motor years . The casual man in Detroit motor circles scoffs at the idea that any group , no matter how powerful or skilful , can make a dent in Ford 's hold on half the total motor sales , but those who are responsible for part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have n't we stopped Ford from growing while we have grown 50 , 75 or 100. , ' " 0 ? As the case may be , Ford has turned out slightly more than 2,000,000 cars a year for the past two years , 2,083,555 in 1924 and 2,103,588 in 1925 , while Chevrolet grew from 314,569 to 518,030 , Iludson-Essex from 133.970 to 265,000 and Dodge from 225,426 to 250,000 . Dodge Brothers ' gain of 25,000 has been the smallest of the three , but its projected gain in output for 1926 is the largest of the three and there seems one inescapable conclusion in view of Dodge prices being cut to a level so near Ford , Chevrolet and Essex that the new management has decided it is time to get a larger piece of the motor sales pie . Down payment being one of the controlling factors in low priced car sales , it is interesting to compare down payments for Ford , Chevrolet , Dodge and Hudson . Prices given are based on delivery in Detroit . PROJECTED GAIN ? Whether or not these projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford 's share of possible sales in 1926 has an important bearing on the outlook for sales and profits of all companies above the low priced field . In times of prosperity the car-buying public has tended to buy more expensive cars as quickly as the purse permits . , This swing was especially noticeable in 1925 . Out of 4,325,000 cars and trucks sold in 1925 , approximately 2,900,000 were sold by Ford , Chevrolet , and Dodge and Essex , leaving 1,400,000 for all other producers . In the so-called higher priced field are . the fewest plans for greatly enlarging output in 1926 . Buick and Chrysler are the outstanding instances .
