The second of three maps visualizing the progress of President-Elect Herbert Hoover around South America appears this week in TIME . The Hoover Odyssey is chronicled in National Affairs . Lands mapped pass in brief review . <P> Chile . Astute observers have called Chileans the Prussians of South America . The comparison is worth remembering . Here is a compact , militant , intensely nationalist people . Though considerably less in number than the residents of New York City , Chileans command official parity among the Great Powers . Thus the U.S. sends an ambassador to 4,000,000 alert Chileans but has never sent more than a minister to 400,000,000 spineless Chinese ( see China ) . <P> As were Prussians in their prime , so <P> Chileans are convinced that theirs is a race of destiny . Even this pretension is not an idle one . By the War of the Pacific ( 1879-82 ) Chileans wrested from ineffectual Bolivians the region of Antofagasta and from Peruvians not only Tarapaca but Arica an Tacna ( see Map ) . <P> The prodigious importance of this conquest appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third largest South American country , was cut off from all access to the sea ; 2 ) Chile acquired the largest nitrate fields in the world , taxes from which now supply over half the revenues of the Chilean Treasury ; and 3 ) Peru was deprived even of Tacna and Arica , without which strategic provinces she can not hope to wrest back her ravished nitrate fields. * <P> Naturally U. S. financiers approve the activist , acquisitive qualities of Chileans , and have dealt hugely and profitably with nearly all of Chile 's able and kinetic dictators . The last of these , ' Colonel Carlos Ibanez who is only incidentally President of Chile , has cleverly adopted the Anglo-Saxon technique of calling his opponents " Communists " and dealing with them as though they were desperadoes . For example the Dictator deported as " dangerous reds " ( TIME , March 21 , 1927 ) a venerable judge of the Chilean Supreme Court and several financiers who opposed his views . <P> Geographically it is interesting that Santiago . Chile , on the West Coast of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Coast of North America . In other words the whole South American Continent lies thousands of miles farther East than most U. S. citizens would guess . <P> Racially Chileans are extremely pure , far purer than the people who seethe in the famed U. S. melting pot . Emigration to Chile has been negligible for centuries . Therefore the nationalism of Chile is like that of Prussia or France , concentrated , organized and militant . <P> Argentina is the melting pot of South America . Article XXV of the Argentine Constitution provides : " The Federal Government shall encourage European immigration and shall not restrict , limit , or place any tax upon the entry into Argentine territory of foreigners who come with the object of cultivating the soil and engaging in local industries .
