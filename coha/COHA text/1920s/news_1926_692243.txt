txt DRIVING OUT CRIMINALS . A Criticism of the Policy of Burdening Another Town . Perhaps some one has a solution for a problem that has always puzzled me , and no doubt has troubled others who have given the matter thought . Why is It that , in dealing with crooks , the authorities take pride in pointing to the fact that a " cleaning up " has cleared out the vicious characters ; that ' they have been driven out of town , and that the particular place where the " cleaning up " has occurred is now free of criminals ? If Philadelphia decides to " clean up " drives the crooks known in Philadelphia to Newark . New York or some other place where they are not known , and so the merry chase goes on and each place exchanges crooks with the other place . Would it not be better if each town made it a point to keep its bad element where it was recognizable and could be watched , in : stead of assuming an attitude of piety in foisting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase and more dangerous because the police can not know them until they Lave committed some wrong and been caught at it ? It does not seem to be good ethics toward neighbors nor good criminology to chase the crooks all over the country . What is the solution ? ARTHUR J. STANFIELD , New York , Dec. 30 , 1025.
