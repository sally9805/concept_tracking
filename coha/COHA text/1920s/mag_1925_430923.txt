THE old man was getting along in years . And he had n't done anything yet . All his life long he had wanted to do something , something that would live through time , something great , monumental , something that would make the name of Gye send forth such a beacon of shining light that even unthinking , careless , hurrying men would remember , halt , and pay homage . There were n't many years left , he knew that , and it began to look as though his ambition were doomed to go to the grave with him . He had money , old man Gye had , but not much . He did n't have enough to found a school , or build a hospital , or leave some other legacy worthy to bear his name through the ages . No , he could n't do that . And he had no children to turn to , none to carry on in his name . Gye frequently bemoaned his fate , his thwarted ambition , as he hurried from the heart of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . So it was on this day , when , as happened every morning and every night , he was accosted with a cheery good day . " AH , GOOD day , Bullock , " he replied , stopping to chat with the stationmaster , a young chap , earnest and serious , who also knew the pangs and pains of ambition . Bullock wanted to be a scien tist , but he was poor , and he had to earn his living at railroading , help support an invalid mother , and use only what he denied himself for the only treasure life seemed to hold for him ? books . Be tween trains this youth studied . They often talked of their ambitions , Gye and Bullock ? the old man from whom life was ebbing fast , and the young man whose blood was only beginning to boil . And this they did again for some moments , until the older man , his face lighted with sudden inspiration , grasped the younger by the arm and gripped it tight with excitement . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said hoarsely . " I have no children . I believe in you . I have faith in you . Some day you will be famous . I can see that . I will leave you the money I have so that you can pursue your life 's ambition , if you will agree to take the name of Gye . " And so it happened . One day , not very much later , while Bullock was still down at the station dividing his time between his duties and his books , the old man died . And the invalid mother died of cancer . Young Bill Bullock resigned his job and , taking the name of his patron , as William Ewart Gye set his face toward his future . Before long , Gye ( the erstwhile Bullock ) found the path he was seeking and , as a promising student of medicine was enrolled at Edinburgh University . There he sat under the brilliant Bennett , an expert on cancer , the dread scourge of humanity , which for 6000 known years had defied investigation . Gye began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an agonizing death . GYE worked hard and long . For a time his labors were interrupted , for war came and every true Briton did h s bit . He was attached to an ambulance train and made studies of gas gangrene that were of inestimable scientific value . But this was only an interlude . No sooner was the war over than Gye went back to his cancer studies . Incessantly he worked . For two years he did not rest from his researched except to sleep and eat . Christmas Day saw him hard at work in his laboratory . He made thousands of experiments with one aim , the isolation of the cancer virus . Many times when success seemed only a step ahead , he was compelled to begin all over again . Finally he came up against a stone wall . He was satisfied that cancer is caused by a germ that enters the body from without , but he was unable to isolate the germ . He tried filtration , but the germs were so small they could not be taken out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them under a microscope ,  | but the nnest microscope he had ever heard of ? instruments that magnified 1500 times ? would not reveal them . Gye was stumped . Now , as so often happens in life , chance enters . The long arm of coincidence , so much longer in real life than any fictionist would dare make it , begins to reach out . It happened that a hatter in Jermyn Street , one J. E. Barnard , head of the firm of William Barnard &; Sons , Hatters , had a hobby . By all the rote of successful business life and the usual aspirations of a shopkeeper , he was as mad a hatter as the hatter Alice met in Wonderland . Instead of hurrying to a golf course when the day 's work was done , or to a card club , or to the races ? which anybody could have told him was the proper thing for a hatter with an income to do ? he went home and amused himself with microscopes . AFTER a while Barnard , the hatter , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a little about lenses . Then Barnard , the hatter , came to be known among British scientists as the man who knew more about lenses than any one in the British Isles . The British Medical Research Council started its great cancer research at Hampstead and nearly every day Barnard , the hatter , after his new stock of bowlers had been arranged and the day 's receipts had been counted up , hied himself to the Hampstead laboratories to experiment with new lights for microscopy that might impress on a photographic plate things invisible to the eye . By ordinary light rays , about 550 millionths of a millimeter in length , magnification 1500 times is possible . But Barnard knew that by shorter light rays , by ultra-violet rays only 275 millionths long , he would be able to magnify 3000 times , even though he would n't be able to see the result . So he experimented with the invention of a group of German scientists at Jena , first announced in 1904 , by which lenses of pure quartz were used instead of glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jumping between two little points of cadmium . And photographic plates were used to catch the invisible light coming up through the lenses with the picture . IT WAS inevitable that Gye , the onetime railway porter with an ambition , should some day meet Barnard , the hatter with a hobby . When Gye confided to friends that he could go no further with his researches unless he could find a more powerful microscope , it was only a matter of time until some one would say to him that he would have to meet Barnard . The two met . " I 've got to catch these viruses under a microscope if my experiments are to succeed , " said Gye to Barnard . " Can you do it for me ? " " I 'll try , " said Barnard . The two worked together steadily and patiently . Gye was constantly at it . Barnard hurried over from Jermyn Street just as soon as his business would free him . Together they conducted countless experiments . They hoped in time to get a picture of 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germs in a group . That would have been an unprecedented achievement , for it would have made theory into fact and would have provided a foundation from which to fight and eventually defeat one of the three worst of earth 's scourges . They worked quietly and unostentatiously . Time and again cures for cancer have been announced and time and again the hearts of men and women have been buoyed up with hope , then cruelly twisted , because the report of a cure was false . Gye and Barnard wanted to make no such mistake . Furthermore , they knew that with the isolation of the virus the battle would be only half won . A cure must be found later . So they kept at it . And finally , one day , Barnard , with quivering hand , turned over to Gye a microphotograph . Gye took it and held it to the light . There was something never before seen by man , something that no eye could ever see , even with the most powerful microscopes ? a photograph of a single round organism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight to catch . Not 50,000 in a conglommerate mass , mind you , but a single round cell ? a cancer germ ! " I think we 've got it this time , " said Gye to Barnard . And the two hurried on with their work . SOME weeks later a crowd gathered in a street outside the office of the Lancet , an English medical journal . At first it was just such an indescribable gathering as happens hundreds of times a day , for no particular reason , in New York , or Chicago , or San Francisco . But this crowd swelled minute by minute , until it bulged through the Strand and disrupted the normal traffic of the street . It was not a joyous crowd , nor yet an angry one , nor yet one merely inquisitive . It was quiet and patient , throbbing with a deep excitement . The event that drew the great crowd was an announcement by the Lancet that the germ of cancer had been isolated by Dr. W. E. Gye , once a railway porter , and J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it plain that the discovery was in no way a cure for cancer , yet it was hailed instantly by scientists throughout the world as one of the greatest medical achievements in history . FOR in tracing the cause of cancer to a germ , the discoverers laid bare a mystery that has baffled physicians for generations . By providing definite knowledge , they paved the way for direct attack on this most dreaded scourge . And they gave science effectiv3. new weapons for striking at the root of other diseases . Scientists point out that , as with other diseases , the discovery of the cause is just the beginning in the fight to wipe out cancer . How soon it can be conquered , no one can say . In the case of malaria , for example , the enemy went down easily , once it had been located . Research workers gradually discovered that malaria was caused by a germ introduced into the blood by a certain type of mosquito . They knew , therefore , that if the mosquito could be prevented from biting men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , attacking the mosquito in its breeding-grounds and making malarial districts healthy . - In the case of diabetes the fight was more stubborn , yet a cure " was found at last in the discovery of insulin . But in the war against tuberculosis , although the position of the enemy long has been known , and although its death toll has been greatly lessened , today there is no known cure other than that of strengthening the body to resist the germs ' attack . In discovering the cancer germ Gye and Barnard reconciled two hitherto conflicting theories of cancer . One theory , commonly held by authorities , was that the disease was due to some change in the body by which unhealthy cells at a bruised point were converted into malignant cells . The other was that cancer was due to a germ entering the body from without . In experiments with chickens , rats , and mice , Doctor Gye found that both theories were right ? that cancer is caused by a germ , but that the germ is able to grow only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mice . Introduced by itself , the cancer germ was powerless , he found . Only by introducing both the germ and germ-free extracts of tumors was he able to grow cancers in mice . With the cancer germ isolated , Doctor Gye and his colleagues in the British Medical Research Council now are busy with experiments to develop a cancer vaccine that will make it impossible for the germ to secure a foothold in the body . In the Hampstead laboratories , definite success has been reported in making chickens , rats , and mice immune to the disease by inoculating them with a serum made from the newly discovered virus . The perfection of human inoculation against cancer , of course , will not be a cure for the disease already contracted , yet scientists hold out the hope that soon it may furnish the basis for a preventive campaign to eradicate this curse of man from the face of the earth .  |
