txt Mayor Hyman took direct issue today with Governor Smith ? over his Staten Island tunnel project , at a public hearing before the Senate and Assembly Cities Committee on the Nicoll-Hofstadter bill , which . pursuant to a recommendation embodied in the report . provides for a change in the plans to make the Narrows tube a. rapid transit agency , not as Mayor Hylan proposes , a combined freight and passenger tunnel . Governor Smith , as a member of the Port Authority , came out in opposition to the Hylan proposal and has not changed his mind about it in the years which have intervened . He regards the Mayor 's plan as utterly impracticable and as an unjustified diversion of funds the city needs for the construction of new subways to an enterprise which comes more directly within the Province of the Port of New York Authority . To change the plan as proposed in the Nicoll-Hofstadter bill , according to the report , would mean a saving to the city of approximately . $40,000,000 and two or three years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mayor in a strong plea against the - bill under discussion declared that to change the plans now would mean that more than $3,000.000 already expended in carrying ' out his own plan would be wasted . He bitterly attacked the report and the method pursued by Justice in making his investigation , virtually accusing the Governor 's Commissioner under the . Sherman-Moreland act of bias and u. denouncing his findings as based pon testimony not daesigned to bring out the truth . Delegation Docks Mayor . The bitterness of the Mayor 's speech was a matter of comment at the Capitol . He was strongly backed by Chief Engineer Arthur S. Tuttle of the Board of Estimate , a number of other engineers employed on his tunnel project , and a large delegation from Staten Island , Brooklyn , Queens and Bronx which applauded the Mayor and other speakers opposing the Nicoll-Hofstadter bill . The only ones to appear in favor of the bill were Walter T. Arndt , representing the Citizens Union ; Senator Nicoll , who spoke very briefly , and Assemblyman Hofstadter , who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hylan recalled that tha original bill was passed by a Republic/fa Legislature and signed by a Republican Governor , and declared that the Transit Commission had always opposed the project . " The Commission sought to show that the city did not have enough money to build such a tunnel , " he said . " or that . if the city did have the money , such funds should be applied to subway construction  --  the new subways , of course , to be operated by the present greedy tralsit operators and linked up with their existing privately operated lines , thus extending their monopoly for their own profit but not for the service of the people . " The Transit Commission was not successful in impeding the work of tunnel construction notwithstanding that many of the corporation-controlled newspapers gave columns of space to the Commission 's specious objections . The Transit Commissioners did , however , gain entrance to the rooms of the Bar ' ' Asociation , where Commissioner was holding the so-called transit investigation . " The absurdity of the contention of the Transit Commissioners must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Commissioners had nothing to do with the plan for the building of this tunnel and that the only possible interest they had in the tunnel was to obstruct its construction . Engineer Not Called , He Says .. " The one man most directly responsible for the work on this tunnel from the preliminary stages of plan preparation to the recently completed shafts is the Chief Engineer of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . A highly competent engineer of long years of service and intimately familiar with the smallest detail of the tunnel project , yet he was not called upon by Colpinisstoner to give the facts upon which a. sound judwent could be based . " We want to proceed with the construction of this freight and passenger tunnel- The huge sum of 511.500.000 has already been appropriated , and of this $2,000,000 has already been expended . Shafts have been sunk on both sides . The contract is being advertised for the section across the bay . Condemnation proceedingshave been started in Richmond for the right of - way for the railroad . Street opening proceedings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needed . Another proceeding is being carried on In Brooklyn for the Owl 's Head Park . which will be traversed by this railroad underground . Title is about to be vested to all the lands necessary to the tunnel project . " The construction of this tunnel will result in the development of a railroad line connecting the four boroughs of New York City with the New England States to the East and with - the main line to the West , with numerous collateral advantages in the nature of favorable freight adjustments , the establishment of additional convenient and efficient freight arid passenger tunnels , the reduction of trucking with saving of cost and relief from vehicular congestion on our waterfront , the elimination of delays caused by waterfront congestion , the rendering more useful and valuable of the city 's $30,000,000 Staten Island pier investment , the development of Flushing Bay , the east side of the Bronx and in partunalar the great landlocked harbor of Jamaica . Bay , and generally the increasing of the capacity of our port and the provision of waterfront facilities unexcelled here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want to give Staten Island , the Borough which has been marooned for years . its first rapid transit connection with the other boroughs of New York as well as to facilitate travel in the Borough of Brooklyn ; We want to save millions of dollars for the people of all the boroughs through a reduction in the cost of foodstuffs , which will be made possible by the direct mail connection , and the elimination of unnecessary freight handling as well as trucking , floating and lighterage charges . " The Administration of the City of New York is capable of handling any local problem , be it small or large . It needs no suggestions and it welcomes no suggestions from self-appointed or State .. appointed overlords . If the Home Rule constitutional amendment , which received such hearty public endorsement , and the Enabling act which made it effective , are anything more than mere airy gestures , then I say that this bill dictating to the six million people of the City of New York in a manner diametrically opposed to their emphatically expressed wishes anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be defeated - as it - deserves to be defeated . " Assemblyman Walter F. Clayton , a Republican , aroused Mayor Hylan 's anger by asking what assurance there Was that railroads coming into New Jersey would send their freight through the proposed tunneL The Baltimore &; Ohio , the only railroad on Staten Island , has already indicated that it could not afford to use the tunnel under the terms of the existing law . " They will come forward and hook up with us. " the Mayor exclaimed , shaking his finger at Mr. Clayton . " So will every road coining into New Jersey from the South and West . They will send their freight through our line into Brooklyn , Queens and the Bronx . That is just as certain as that the sun will rise tomorrow . " . Beady to Debate Plan . " How do you know ? " Mr. Clayton persisted . " I will meet you anyhere and debate any assertion of mine , " retorted the Mayor . " I am not afraid of you . I have met you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like matey of your predictions ; they do n't come true . " ' Assemblyman Hofstadter declared that to permit Mayor Hylan to spend $60,000 , - 000 on the proposed freight and passenger tunnel would be to permit him to " dump $60.000,000 in a hole in the ground . " Corporation Counsel-Nicholson filed a brief in which he contended that , as the original tunnel bill had been : sent to Mayor Hylan for approval by Governor Miller , the present measure was a city measure , which under the home rule act could only be passed by the Municipal Assembly . Mr. Arndt declared that transit matters did not come under the home rule act and that Governor Miller had sent the original bill to Mayor Hylan as an act of courtesy . Chief Engineer Tuttle of the Board of Estimate declared that $3,880,000 already spent on the tunnel would be wasted if the project were killed . He declared that Justice 's assertion that a rapid transit tunnel could be constructed for $20,000,000 was fallacious and that no tube to Staten Island could be built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation of the Staten Island Tunnel Committee , representing twenty-two civic organizations , on Staten Island , was present , and voiced enthusiastic approval of the-Mayor and other speakers opposing the bill .
