THE case against grammar is one on which the professor perpetually holds open hearings . He passes , for example , the bulletin-board where he has posted the next assignment for " Sophomore English . " The victims are copying the list of poems , one calling off the titles , the others scribbling in their notebooks . " ' The Grammarian 's Funeral , " ' calls the announcer . Every one responds . " Listens good to me . " " I 'll say she do . " " When are they going to pull it off ? " " Ought to run it in the movies ; it ' d draw like a chimney . " Again , as Acting-Critic-in-General to his friends , the professor gets a letter from a popular writer asking for " unsparing criticism " of his latest work . The writer suffers , as a friend should , in chastened silence , till the professor touches on a point of grammar , then the galled jade winces . " What good is grammar , anyway ? " he writes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lore to the everlasting bonfire . He quotes with glee the impassioned sage who said , " When the English language gets in my way , so much the worse for the English language . " The letter closes with a postscript , " Kindly tell me to settle a bet whether both verbs in the following sentence should be plural . . . " He might , then , have admitted that grammar has one use , to settle bets ? if there had really been any bet to settle ; but there was not . The writer asked the question because he wanted to know . The tirade against grammar was nervous bravado , as a dog barks to cover a strategic retreat . The noise of such barking as his reaches the professor , the modern representative of the medievalgrammarian , from many sides . If what he hears from the world beyond his study walls be typical , nine persons out of ten shy at the word grammar like nervous colts , or prance round the subject as does a puppy round a snapping-turtle , threatening it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what its sins may be , unable either to conquer it once for all or let it alone . The grievance is an ancient one ; the feeling which would make the grammarian 's funeral a joyful occasion to most of mankind is so old that it might almost be an inherited instinct . Probably no one knows just when the trouble began , but we know that there was a grammar-school in Rome about two thousand years ago , and that by the time we get to the Middle Ages grammar is invested with all its terrors . By that time the word represented to the popular mind all the mystery of learning ; learning which the people denounced as useless and feared at the same time , because they knew not what advantage over them it might give to its possessors . They could conceive of no advantage save the material one , and no mystery save magic . Virgil , whose name they heard on the lips of cleric and scholar , became to their minds the arch necromancer , not , as a tribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . All learning was in Latin , and grammar was the key to it . Just as Virgil becomes the magician in the thought of the people , so " gramarye " comes to mean magic , the one mystery of which the unlettered folk know more than do any others , but which they constantly attribute to the learned who know nothing more of it than what they learn from the people . Among medieval grammarians , as among the modern , sound scholars were in the minority ; the others did what they could to inflate their mystery and to make the most of popular misconception of their learning . As time went on and learning slowly spread , increasing numbers of boys learned grammar only to hate it . To them it represented only years of torture , the agonizing process of attempted mental effort under the lash . Dogs have terrified cats for unnumbered centuries ; small wonder if blind new kittens bristle at a whiff of the hereditary enemy . Are not nineteen or twenty centuries of pedagogical terrorizing almost enough to make a new-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double its fists at the sight of a grammarian ? Grammar is to most of us an elusive mystery , maddening as a mosquito , real when it stings , but nothing to grasp . The beginner is apt to get the impression from his teacher that its rules are unwavering , and that whoso breaks the smallest of its laws is cast into the outer darkness . Then he notices that the minister in the pulpit says " do n't " where he should say " does n't , " and no consuming wrath either from above or below comes to destroy him . He catches " the best people " tripping in their speech , and even Teacher herself one memorable day spoke in class of the best of two exercises ! He begins to defy the gods . " You ca n't say , It is me , ' " says Teacher . " Ca n't I ? " he retorts , " just you watch me . " He decides that Teacher 's gods are only a set of little grinning clay images on a shelf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing from their perch and walks out a free man . Free be remains until he perceives that his stenographer is disdainfully correcting his lapses in grammar , that some of his customers set him down a notch or two on account of his manners of speech , that he needs grammar in his business . Then he feels about it as Silas Lapham did about the white gloves . He feels that its etiquette is slight , trivial , contemptible ; he hates i and himself that he is baffled by it . He would gladly wrestle with it and throw it , but when he seeks to grasp it it vanishes . He knows that there are limits beyond which he does not wish to go in his freedom in language , but he can not find them . They shift and recede like the shore in a fog , which you bump when you try to avoid it and seek in vain when you wish to land . It is at about this point in his experience that he becomes the linguistic Bolshevik ; driven frantic by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherewithal to meet its demands , he wishes he could destroy grammar , and after it is gone enjoy in peace all its benefits . If the layman turns to the grammarian for help , he is not likely to get it . Any grammarian will give reasons that look sound for preferring this construction to that , but they do not wear well ; you soon find them unsatisfactory . In the first place , you discover that what you want is facts , not reasons . The real question is not , " Why should we say this rather than that ? " but , " Do we say this , or do we say that ? " In the second place , the reason you get from one grammarian is promptly discredited by another . Professor A tells you to use construction X because it has been in continuous good Use for five hundred years . 13 prefers Y because it is analogous to another construction . C votes for Z because " a majority of our best writers and speakers " use it . Each argument is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not final , nor are all three together necessarily so . The historical argument has weight ; if we know that a construction has been in use for centuries , we know at least that it has proved useful , and we may think twice before we discard it at the word of the purist . But we do not cling to all we have once had ; if we did we should still speak Anglo-Saxon . The argument from analogy is good in so far as uniformity is desirable , but it is not a law ; we do not reject all constructions for which other constructions do not give us precedent . As for good usage , grant that it is the usage of a majority of our best writers and speakers , the question remains , What do they actually say or write ? What court shall determine who they are , and appoint tellers to poll them ? The arguments of the grammarians have been reduced to a whirligig ( by Prof. H. T. Peck ) in the following form : Q. Does the passive verb admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verb admits an object after it because people use it that way . Q. Why is it right for people to use it that way ? A. Because the passive verb admits an object after it . If this be grammar , the layman is justified in rejecting it , but it is not ; only half of it is grammar , the rest is etiquette . The rebel who condemns grammar to the flames is justly called a Bolshevik , because democracy is not democratic enough for him . He is like the cat-thatwalks-by-himself in that he wishes all benefits without any restraints or duties , His party is smaller but more noisy than that of the Agnostics , who do not know enough about grammar to hold any opinions of their own , but accept with dyspeptic grace such crumbs of fact and doctrine as they can gather from others . There are the Democrats , who hold that majority rules in Grammarland , therefore all that is is right . There are the Puritans who hold that almost everything that is is wrong ; that the only good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like the " best room " of our grandmothers , which was good for nothing but a funeral ) ; that we should seek to accord our wills with that of the grammar-book ; that none have attained grace but themselves and their wives , and sometimes they have doubt about their wives . There are the Royalists who believe in the divine right of the grammarians to make the rules as they should be and enforce them with thunder and guns on the lesser folk who walk CXL , ? No , 857 , - 52 in darkness . Perhaps not all of us belong to these parties . Perhaps only half of us are barking at grammar and most of us are barking at one another . The parties represent only in the crudest way the main divisions of opinion ; there are countless shades of thought and feeling . The main point is that nearly every one has a grievance , either against grammar or against those who hold some heretical view of grammar . For one of the fundamental difficulties of the situation there is no possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the grammarians . Its origin goes back beyond all records , but it is easy to see that it was invented by an anthropoid who used one kind of grunt to mean peace and another to mean war , and the only survivors were those who understood him . Naturally they copied his system , and it soon became bad form to talk any other . We do not know just when this inventor lived , but it might have been about three hundred thousand years ago . His system was practised and developed for perhaps two hundred and ninety-four thousand years before we have the slightest trace of it on record . By that time , some six or seven thousand years ago , languages were so numerous and so well developed that users of thent resorted tosuch images as the Tower of Babel to express the state of linguistic chaos in which they found themselves . And still it was three or four thousand years before anybody paid any attention to it ( worth mentioning ) , or tried to train it in the way it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarreling as to the proper method . So we must infer that grammar Ied a wild , untutored life for approximately two hundred and ninety-eight thousand years ; how could its trainers expect to reform it in a paltry two thousand , especially since they have never fully agreed on the way to go about it ? The controversy flared up almost as soon as there were any grammarians , between the Democrats and the Royalists , the Anomalists and the Analogists , as they were then called . The Democrats insisted that there were no rules of grammar in any proper sense of the word . The Royalists declared that there were . Alter some four hundred years of foray and reprisal the Royalists were declared the winners . There were rules , the decision announced , but the rules , being only mortal , were unfortunately subject to a malady known as exceptions . The two parties were never really united , and their offspring were what might be expected ? Puritan and Bolshevik , nervous fanatics carrying their parents ' worst traits to extremes , and the rickety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth we shall find it , but not all of it in the possession of any one . When the Democrat declares that all that is is right , he says sooth if he means that the grammarian should record facts rather than issue decrees . If he means that one way of putting words together is in no way whatsoever to be preferred to another , he is wrong , for different ways of speech have their various effects on divers hearers , and the consequences , according to these effects , are more or less to be desired . If he means that the rules of grammar are not even safe as generalizations , he is wrong , for the main facts are widely and firmly established by centuries of usage . If he means that our speech may safely be left to itself to develop as chance or unconscious human nature may direct , very likely he is right , but he seems to neglect the fact that for as many centuries as the records cover the conservative force has been one of the " natural " forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but asserts that so far as the conservative force has been effective it has worked for evil , he is probably wrong . At least it affords wholesome opposition for the radicals and tests for their innovations . The Puritan , the ultra-conservative , is right in recognizing that time and usage are the tests of language ; his mistake is in condemning the constructive elements . He is within his rights if he chooses to frown on every construction that can not show a century or two of good usage , but if he would make this procedure the rule for all he would condemn the language to death , and it is not unjust to say of him that he believes there is no good grammar but dead grammar , for no language can live without growing . The Royalist of to-day conceals under the name of " science " or the plea of " logic " his belief in the divine right of the grammarian to issue decrees . Here , for example , is one of his proclamations : Grammar is a science or nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties spring out of its scientific character . There are definitions to be framed , principles to be stated , rules to be prescribed , all of which operations , if entered upon at all , should be carried on in a scientific spirit . A loose way of proceeding in this respect fails to answer the ends of grammar , and fails still more as a mental discipline . The phrasing is modern enough ? the passage is from a preface of Bain 's dated 1872 ? but the position the grammarian takes differs in nothing essential from that of the Analogists of the beginning of the Christian Era . Here are the questions that divided the main parties twenty centuries ago , and that divide them to-day . Is grammar a science ? Has it any rules ? Is it the right , the duty , the privilege of the grammarian to " prescribe rules " for mankind in the use of language ? " Grammar is a science or nothing , " we read in the preface . Then if we find in the text nothing but commandments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to take the grammarian at his word . " This is not science , " we say , " therefore it is nothing . " Grammar is not a science if it is a table of commandments . It is not a science if by science we mean a body of facts that stay in their categories without variableness or shadow of turning . It has no rules if by rules we mean universal Jaws . But if this is what we mean by science there is no science save that which deals with things inorganic , inert , dead ; things like sand , sulphuric acid , figures . What law of life has man ever discovered but death ? If the autocratic grammarian is willing to admit that he believes that there is no good language but dead language , we may leave him to do his work on such language as he considers proper for his operations . Autopsy is easier than vivisection , and more humane . But language is not inorganic nor dead ; it is as vital as life itself ; its evolution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secrets of the shifting forms of life , as little subject to any laws that man can frame . Now , merely because it is baffling we do not deny to biology the name of science , nor to what we might , if we speak in general terms , call its special fields psychology and anthropology . In these fields we find the roots of grammar , for it is deeply rooted in the nature of man and the world about him . Of quackery every branch of science has had its share , but the chemistry of to-day is not discredited by the alchemy of yesterday . Grammar should not suffer from the presumption of those who give its name to their personal taboos . Grammar is a science in so far as it attempts to collect and arrange the facts about language . If it can draw universal laws or even general principles from the facts , that , too , is science so far as it goes . But it is not science to declare that one fact is " right " and another is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn a generalization into a universal by de daring with tears or anathemas or both that we must obey it . A true universal takes care of itself because it is what it is by the very nature of things , and can not be otherwise . A " scientific law " that requires penalties and threats for its enforcement carries its brand of counterfeit on its face . To frame definitions may be a scientific process if it is scientifically done , but to prescribe rules is the poorest sort of pedagogy . And to say that unless we make our grammar thus and so it fails as mental discipline , is like saying that mountains must have no grades of less than 10 per cent , or they are useless as gymnasiums . Grammar is a science when it deals with facts ; it may be a science when it deals with theories ; but when it deals with commandments it is nothing but a book of etiquette . The question of science is closely akin to the question of logic . Is grammar logical ? Ought it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern one verb with an adjective and another with an adverb ? Ought we not always to do things the same way ? In other words , if grammar is not logical , should we not make it so ? The question is essentially the one that was answered in the second century A.D. by the decision that grammar has rules , but they are subject to exceptions , and again by the logician who declares that the " science " of the grammarian functions when he promulgates rules . His work reminds one of that of the " topiary artist " who tortures a box-tree into the shape of an eagle and keeps it so by trimming it once a month ; he may do so till he and the tree are both dead , but he can never make a box-tree grow of itself in the shape of an eagle . Grammar is logical if we study it scientifically ; we find causes to account for so many of the facts that we are sure there are causes for all of them if we could find them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants is uniformity , He tries to find it in rules , and to make it where it does not exist by proclaiming rules of his own invention . If we consider what we know and may believe of the history of grammar , we need not be surprised that it is not logical , but rather that it is as logical as it is . Not being persons of ideal intelligence ourselves , we can hardly imagine what our forefathers might have done with grammar if they had been so . Perhaps they would have made it absolutely uniform in all its processes ; perhaps they would have attained some higher ideal inconceivable to our little minds . Shall we take in vain the sacred name of progress by complaining that our ancestors were not more intelligent than we ? Might we not more becomingly challenge our own intelligence ? If grammar were logical , would it fit us ? We should probably be like a man with a thirty-four chest and a forty-four waist trying to wear a suit of clothes like the one in the poster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting curves about the waist . Language is a pretty close measure of a people 's intelligence ; it will fit us whatever we do . If we do not like what we see in the mirror , if the books that record the facts of our language are not pleasant reading , we can not expect to improve matters much by direct action , by legislation ; we must look to ourselves . But the truth is that if we have a proper mirror we need not be violently dissatisfied with what we see . The desirable standard is as much uniformity as is compatible with sound growth and proper flexibility . Some such standard English has already attained if we may take the word of the foreign scholars who praise it as second only to Chinese in point of its logical system of grammar , and at the same time as more flexible than most European languages . If this is the Bolshevik 's ideal , then indeed the truth is with him . One can hardly tell whether it is so or not , for he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the wall will not fall down for the blowing of trumpets , if the army will not flee for the smashing of crockery , why , let the smashing of crockery go on ? something must be smashed ; better our own lamps and pitchers than nothing . He wishes to destroy grammar because he feels it as a restraint , and since we never hear of anything he would offer to take over its service , he leaves the impression that he wishes the destruction not as a general benefit to mankind , but as a personal convenience to himself . He cares not how others may speak , and does not see why any one should care how he speaks ; he thinks of speech as an indi vidual matter , which in its very nature it is not . It is a community matter ; its essence is in relations with others . The Bolshevik party represents an important part of the motive power that urges us on , but it is not sufficient in itself . Mere power will take us nowhere without means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clamor of voices we may listen in vain for any clear word to tell us what collectively we really want . We can not take a poll , and to try td determine by other means is as uncertain as are forecasts before an election . But there are a few facts which may shape such guesses as we can make . First , we do well to remind ourselves that language is the most democratic institution on earth . It was made by the people for their own use , probably without clear consciousness of what they were about for by far the greater part of its history . It is perpetually subject to the initiative and referendum ; if the people do not like it they change it , unconsciously . The grammarians can not prevent this ; the tyranny of grammar is not with them ; it is the tyranny of habit , the tyranny of custom , the tyranny of fashion , the tyranny of democracy . When the schoolboy finds that the laws of grammar are not backed by tangible executive power , he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds that they are worse than laws enforced by the police , being defended by penalties ranging from misunderstanding through varying degrees of social obloquy to downright ostracism . So far as he is concerned , the authority is external ; he is conscious of no part in forming the rules , nor does he feel the slightest power in his influence to change them . The fact is obvious , however , that grammar does change , and the people change it . It changes so slowly that even a generation is scarcely aware of the fact , but if we look back down the centuries it is so clearly manifest that to mention it is a platitude . English grammar of King Alfred 's time we learn as if it were that of a foreign language . i3y the end of the fourteenth century it seems somewhat more familiar , but students have been known to declare that they found French or German grammar easier than the phonology and accidence of Chaucer 's English . Two hundred years more make the change from Middle English to Modern ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid from glossary or notes . Yet Dr. E. A. Abbott gave us five hundred pages of his Shakespeare Grammar , and a student who must pass an examination on it will tell you that it contains much to learn . We need no written records to tell us that these changes were made by those who spoke the language in their adaptation of it to their daily needs . It is a safe guess that most of them were made over the protests of the grammarians , since there have been any , because the grammarians represent professionally the conservative party whose function it is to test changes as they come up , to prolong their period of probation , to make us think twice before we adopt them . Protests against the socalled split infinitive now ' seem vain ; those of us who were taught to shudder at it in our youth still shun it , but all others use it freely . The distinction between like and as seems to be breaking down , and that between shall and will bids fair to follow , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammarians have done and are doing in their behalf . On the other side , we seem to see the protest of the grammarian sustained by popular vote in cases like those of the " dangling participle " and the expression " these kind , " which passed without blame in Addison 's time and later . Language is more democratic than politics ; it does not seek to deny even to the autocrat his vote and influence . We who use it , whoever or whatever we are , have it in our hands to shape to our ends . What , then , is the case against grammar ? It is largely , in plain truth , one of ignorance . Grammar has a bad name we need not quarrel now about where it came from ? but is that reason enough for hanging it ? We say we want a. better system of grammar , but most of us do not know how good our system is . We demand that it shall be simple , logical , flexible , adequate ; what shall we answer when foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects to the heart 's desire ? If we measure our ideals in language by what we already have , the result is on the whole flattering to everything but our knowledge of our riches ? we have pretty nearly what we want if only we knew it . We have to appreciable measure the qualities that make language good , we have the power to make it better if we can make ourselves better along with it . We need more wide-spread knowledge of what grammar actually is and how it came about ? not a knowledge of how former grammarians sought to impose on a living language the inflexible categories of a dead one , but a knowledge of our speech as a living organism . Let grammar as a book of etiquette go till we learn more of the facts ; biology does not concern itself with animals as they ought to be until it knows them pretty well as they are . Except for what we might have to unlearn , grammar in this aspect would be no more difficult to present to the mind than biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for more , if possible , than these sciences is it a matter of daily experience with all of us . With intelligent knowledge of what we have , we should gain intelligent ideals of what we might wish it to be . If we had these , we should not be troubled at any diversity of opinion on the subject , however wide . Grammar would be safe in the hands of the various parties if each stood on a platform of intelligent opinion . If we knew it in all its ways , we might still have a case against grammar , but we should also have ideals , and we might with proper grace call it a poor thing if we felt it strongly our own .
