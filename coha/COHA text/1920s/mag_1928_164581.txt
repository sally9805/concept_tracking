Preston S. Arkwright , Atlanta lawyer , went into the office of President Henry Morrell Atkinson of the Georgia Railway &; Power Co. , asked him to sign certain securities . " Sign them yourself , " said President Atkinson , and went on working . Politely Lawyer Arkwright insisted , " I am <P> sorry , Mr. Atkinson , but they must be signed by the president of the company . " Casually President Atkinson said : " That 's all right . You sign them . You 're the president now . " That was in 1912 . <P> Last week on the Million Dollar Pier at Atlantic City , N. J. , before 10,000 utility-men , and with more formality , Preston S. Arkwright ( now president of the Georgia Power Co. ) was installed as president of the National Electric Light Association . <P> Did he believe his inauguration to occur at an awkward time , and his responsibility onerous , he must have been reassured by the valedictory of the retiring N. E. L. A. president , Howard T. Sands of Manhattan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . In an investigation like this by the Federal Trade Commission , involving every act of thousands of companies , hundreds of thousands of separate transactions ... for the last quarter of a century , it would be miraculous if there should not be found some instances of bad judgment , of the influence of greed , even perhaps of actual wrongdoing . Such instances , if any be found , will , I am sure , represent a very minute percentage of the transactions under investigation . "
