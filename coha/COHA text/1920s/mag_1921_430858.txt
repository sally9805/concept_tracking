IN many ways the social spirit of England has been more changed in the last six years of history than in the six centuries preceding them . Such a statement may seem fantastic in exaggeration for the sake of an easy and arresting phrase , yet it is exactly true of certain characteristics of English life and habit , for the war was a convulsion which shook England to the core and broke up many of its old instincts and traditions of social faith . In spite of modern developments of democracy and industry , the progress of education , and the growth of cities , England remained , until the World War , amazingly feudal in its structure and insular in its habits of thought . The old landed aristocracy maintained in the countryside the power and allegiance which they had possessed for hundreds of years , and the small farmers and tenantry , fast rooted to their soil , had no sense of change and no desire for change . In counties like Somerset and Devon , Warwick and Gloucester , Norfolk and Suffolk , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , but little different from his forefathers of Tudor and Plantagenet times , spoke almost the language of Chaucer , so that to the London man , modernized , quick-witted , the " yokel " of the south , west , and north was incomprehensible in his dialect , and primitive in his outlook and understanding . The landed gentry , in old country mansions , changed the cut of their clothes , danced the foxtrot , adopted the latest social fashion , but instinctively , in the very fiber of their bodies , in allegiance to a tradition of life and to a certain plot of land which was theirs , were intensely insular . I remember a year or two before the war a startling instance of the conservatism of English life beyond the cities . It was when the craze for " pageants " had caught hold of English imagination , so that in many old towns the people dressed themselves in the costumes of the past , re-read the history of their forefathers , and acted the drama of the centuries from Saxon times to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one scene of it was to represent a chapter of history when , five hundred years ago , the gentlemen of Norfolk , with their squires , came to pay homage to Mary Tudor , their princess . Five centuries had passed , but every actor in the scene bore the same name , lived on the same soil , held the same place , as those ancestors of his who had knelt before the Tudor princess . In a thousand ways like this England held to the past . The people were insular , and the sea which divided them from the Continent was a great water of defense against the spirit of change , except in outward , superficial things . Then the war came and changed everything in the spirit of the English people . . . . At first it seemed as though it would be like other wars of England ? a foreign expedition of a little professional army , and of young lads eager to see " foreign parts by taking the king 's shilling . They would fight gallantly , many would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsprints , and then the bells would ring for victory , the lads would come marching back , and English life would go on again , hardly touched or altered . Even at Waterloo there had been only twenty-five thousand English soldiers . To the mass of  |p560  English folk the Napoleonic Wars had been a remote and distant thing , not affecting their own lives much . When the great World War broke out the British troops who were sent , according to the pledge with France , were called the " Expeditionary Force , " as in the old days . But presently the Regular Army was spent , and presently all the youth of the nation was sent out , the younger brothers following the elder brothers , the married following the single men , fathers of families conscripted like the boys at school . England was all in ? all her men , all her women , and no escape for any of them in the service of death . No living body in England was exempt from the menace of destruction . Death came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing mothers , babies , anyone . The enemy attacked them in little homes in back streets , in big factory centers , in the heart of London . . So England was no longer safe in her island . An island people , uninvaded for a thousand years , with utter reliance on her fleet as an invincible shield , were suddenly shocked into the knowledge that the sea about them was no longer an impassable gulf between them and all foreign foes . It was a shock which broke up the old psychology and the instincts of a , thousand years . English youths went out to the death fields , hundred thousand after hundred thousand , until four million men had gone that way . From first to last on all fronts the men of the English counties ? not Irish , nor Scots , nor Welsh , nor Canadian , nor Australian ? made up 64 per cent of the British fighting forces . They were English soldiers who fought most , and endured most , and died most , because there were most of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English people do n't talk most about themselves . Out of every four men who went out to the World War one did not come back again , and of those who came back many are maimed and blind and some are mad . England and the spirit and mind of England were altered by so great : an ordeal which had come to every home and heart . In many ways the alteration was plainly visible during the war , especially to fighting men who came home from the dirty ditches on three days ' leave , or seven . The home-staying people ? the old and middle-aged , the women , the workers in the factories providing the material and munitions of war , the government officials , clerks , and employers of labor , even the young girls ? seemed to be possessed by a new energy , a more vital spirit , a restless and energetic excitement . They were all " out to win . " They were all , in big ways or little , dynamic in their activities . Caste was for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrician women were making munitions with factory girls . A great , strong , spiritual wind seemed to have swept through all classes of English life . It had cleansed even the slums of great English cities which had seemed past cleansing . Before the war an immense population in England crowded into the cities , had lived below the poverty line or on the thin edge of it ? miserably , precariously , dirtily . There was a mass of floating , casual labor often out of work , huddled in the hovels of back streets , in filthy conditions . Their children were ragged , barefooted , underfed . Now those conditions had been altered by the war . The demand for labor was so great that every able-bodied man could get a good wage . The government and the employers paid great wages for skilled work . Mechanics who had found trouble in getting forty or fifty shillings a week now gained two hundred or three hundred shillings a week . Any girl with her hair hanging down her back or tied into a pigtail could get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Munitions girls were getting three and four pounds a week , some of them far more than that . Small families , all working , paid by government money , raked in an incredible weekly revenue . For the first time they had a broad  |p561  margin of money for the fun of life as well as for its sharp necessities . I remember being home on leave once during the war and walking in the park of a poor district of London on a bank holiday ? that day when the poor people used to come out of their slums in their rags to enjoy a little liberty . This time there were no rags , but well-dressed children , girls overdressed in the imitation of fashionable ladies , a strange new look of prosperity and well-being . At that time the workers in factory towns had more money than they knew how to use , and bought absurd little luxuries , and grabbed at the amusements of life without thought of the morrow . There were pianos in the homes of coal-heavers , and the wives of laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . The fighting man , back from the trenches , where he risked death every day and every minute of every day for one shilling and twopence , was startled by the money made by the luckier men who worked for war at home . He saw injustice there , inequality of service and reward , and sometimes was bitter and blasphemous on the subject . But , on the whole , the soldier did not begrudge the money earned by the home workers . They were his folk . He was glad of their luck , though he did not share it . He believed that when he came home ? if he came home ! ? he , too , would get high wages for any job he might get . His wrath , and the wrath of the home workers ( in spite of their own prosperity ) were reserved for the manufacturers and financiers who were making enormous profits out of government contracts ? vast profits out of the massacre . " The profiteers , " as they were called , sometimes fairly and sometimes unfairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of working people , and by the old gentry who gave their youth to war , according to old traditions and the law of their caste , without any reward but that of pride and honor . They saw themselves doomed by the uprising of the New Rich . The small landowner , the country squire , the nobleman of the old order , aloof from trade and manufactures , gave their wealth to the service of the state as they gave their sons , and upon them fell , year by year , a heavier burden of taxation . Before the end of the war , and after the end of it , many of them sold their estates , which had been in their families for hundreds of years , sold also their family treasures . The New Rich took possession of many old mansions , bought the family heirlooms of the old regime , renovated and vulgarized old historic places . I know one family of the ancient order whose history in the war is typical of others . There were four sons , and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were killed . The daughters became nurses and devoted themselves to the wounded during all the years of war . The mother died by the strain of war . Increasing taxation bore down heavily upon an already impoverished estate . The father , a peer whose name belongs to the great memories of England , sold the pictures of his ancestors to an American millionaire , then the treasures and relics of his house . It is now an empty shell , and the eldest son , back from the war , farms a little plot of land , with one of the New Rich in possession of the great estate , which belonged to the family since the first Charles was king . A social revolution has been accomplished in England by this turn in the wheel of fortune . The New Poor ? once the old gentry ? are scraping along on the remnants of former wealth ; the New Rich possess their places , and so far have not learned those traditions of kindness , of generosity , and of noble manners which made the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way previously unknown to a great extent in England , small traders , little manufacturers , business adventurers without capital or power , seized the chance of war , the needs of a government reckless of all cost , provided the supplies of war came in , and made rapid progress to great prosperity . Their  |p562  profits mounted higher and higher , and , though the government imposed upon them an excess-profits duty , most of them dodged it , in one way or another . It was the middle-class man or woman that was hardest hit by taxation before the ending of the war , and by the prices of life 's necessities rising higher and higher every month . The laboring classes kept mostly beyond the pace of these rising prices by rising wages . Well organized and fully aware of their new importance as the workers for victory , they saw to it that their wages should always be on the upgrade and beyond the tide of living costs . If that did not happen they went on strike , and the government yielded ? every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , though secretly it knew that there would be a fearful reckoning when victory was assured , if it might be assured , which was not always certain . But there were many people between the devil and the deep sea ? between the profiteers and organized labor . They were unorganized . They were living on the interest of small capital . They were dependent on fixed salaries , or professional fees which could not be increased . Their rents were raised . The income-tax assessor had no mercy on them . The cost of living frightened them . They were reduced to a state of stinting and scraping , underfeeding , clinging to shabby clothes . They , more than any , belonged to the New Poor . . . . Then at last the war ended and masses of men came back from the battlefields , leaving an Army , of Ghosts behind them ? their dead comrades . Then all things changed under the surface of English life . Those men who came back were not the same men as those who had gone away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from villages in England where their life had been very narrow , very limited in ideas and speech . Many of the boys in those villages were as simple and unthinking as the peasants of the Middle Ages . From the city slums they had gone out in the big battalions , and the undersized , underfed , ill-aired lads of that city life had been broadened and strengthened , well fed , well aired in an outdoor life that was healthy and fine when it was not deadly and dreadful . They had taken frightful risks as a daily habit , until the thought of death was not much to them . They had mixed and talked with men of many minds . They had thought strange thoughts in the silence of night watches with the instant menace of death about them . Some of them were broken in nerve . Some of them were brutalized and demoralized by this life of war . Many of them were bitter and resentful of the things they had had to do and suffer and see . All of them hated war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans were guilty of that war , though most guilty , but that something was wrong with civilization itself , with the governments of nations , with the Old Men who had sent the young men to the trenches , because this massacre had been arranged or allowed . They were eager to get back home , and thousands were kept rotting in mind and body in many far places ? as far as Mesopotamia ? months after peace . When they came home they were not eager at first to get to work . They had earned , they thought , a holiday , a long rest . They had served England . England could keep them for a bit . So for many months they idled , played around , restlessly , never quite satisfied , not fitting easily again into civil life and home life ? and the government still kept them on unemployed doles , piling up the national debt , printing more paper money , which was nothing but a promissory note on future industry . Prices did not fall ; they rose higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still demanded the same margin of profit on goods made and sold . The ex-soldier was exasperated by these prices . His government dole was not large enough to give him much of a margin for the fun of life . Presently he began to demand work . The mass of  |p563  skilled hands found it easily enough , on the whole , and at war wages . But there was a great mass of unskilled labor which could not get work . It was very skilled labor in the art and craft of war . It was made up of expert machine gunners , experienced airmen , riflemen , bombers , trench-mortar experts , fellows who could use a bayonet dexterously . But it was utterly unskilled in the arts and crafts of peace . These men had been boys when they were recruits . They had gone out to war straight from school . They had skipped apprenticeship to any trade . They had not even learned typewriting or clerical work . When they asked for jobs the trade-unions said : " Where is your apprenticeship ticket ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployed man . " I was fighting for England and the whole damn crowd of stayat-homes . " " Sorry , " said the trade-union foreman . " You were little heroes , no doubt , and we 're much obliged to you , but we do n't dilute skilled labor with unskilled trash . It 's against the trade-union rules . " It was also , it seemed , against the principles of many employers of labor in the great cities , the managers of city offices . Young gentlemen who had been officers in the infantry or the aircraft , in the tanks or machine-gun corps , called upon them in search of clerkships . These were the loyal gentlemen who , while the young men were fighting and dying , said , " We will fight to the last man ? to the bitter end . " But now that the end had ' come , with victory , some of them looked doubtfully at the ex-officer boys who had had the luck to come back , and uttered disconcerting words . " You are hardly fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time in the army . Probably you have acquired habits which would not make you useful in this business . On the whole , we prefer boys just out of school or just down from the university . " So young ex-officers after various experiences of this kind went away using language they had learned in Flanders strong , unprintable language ? with great bitterness in their hearts . On Christmas Day last in London , while the streets were filled with people doing their shopping , some of these exofficers ? heroes of the war ? stood on the sidewalks , turning the handles of piano organs , appealing to the charity of passers-by . Probably they were the worst and not the best of the unemployed officers , the scalywags , but it was not good to see them . The sight of them there sickened some of us who had been with them in the war . I know a lieutenant-colonel who was reduced to hawking about a book from house to house . By an irony of fate it was a History of the Great War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales of the book he was to get a small commission , but at the end of his first week 's work , when he had agonized with shyness and shame , afraid to ask for the " lady of the house " lest she should be one with whom he had taken tea in better days , he was fourpence down on his expenses . There are many men like that ? some are friends of mine ? who have never been able to get a decent job since the armistice . Civil life has no place for them , in spite of Lord Haig 's constant noble appeals to the nation on their behalf . The men had a better chance than their officers , and until recent days the majority did get assimilated into the ranks of labor , although a minority remained unemployed , and in some cases , owing to nervous debility after the shock of war , unemployable . The government was not unmindful of these men . Every unemployed soldier received , and still receives , a weekly allowance , now reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrape along without starvation , but no more than that , and without any sense of good reward . The man who does n't like work makes it do . The man who wants to work and ca n't receives this dole without gratitude ? with a curse in his heart at a nation 's ingratitude.  |p564  Among his rivals , keeping him out of work , were the girls of England . During the years when manhood was away in masses the girls came out of their homes , took the places of the men in many kinds of work ? rough work as well as soft work ? and did wonderfully well . They were happy in that work , earning good wages which enabled them to buy pretty frocks , to amuse themselves in holiday hours , to be magnificently independent of the stuffy little homes in which they had been like caged birds . English girlhood found its wings in the war , and flew away from the old traditions of inclosure to a large liberty . That has been an immense social change . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cleareyed girls of war-time England , now grown to womanhood , have nothing in common with the prim and timid ways of their mammas and grandmammas , but face life without shyness or fear ? confident , frank , adventurous , . out for fun at any price ? which is sometimes too high and horrible . Since the war a new generation of youth ? boys as well as girls ? has grown up . The younger brothers are filling the places of the elder brothers who were in the fighting fields and did not come back . It is a new kind of youth in England , belonging to a new life strange to us older men . It is not touched by the shadow of war . It has got clear away from that . It refuses to be gloomy with present conditions ; it is impatient of the tragedy that hangs over older minds . It is very daring in its desire to cut clean away from old traditions of thought and manner . It is joyous , reckless , amazingly thoughtless of trouble ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot into the passing hour . The lessons and the memories of war do not seem to sober it or touch it with any gravity . So it seems to superficial observers , even sometimes to men like myself , whose job it is to observe below the surface , that the English people have forgotten , too quickly , the things that happened ? the men who died , the men who live in blindness , in madness , in hospitals for cripples and shell-shock cases . Many times I have been saddened by this thought of quick forgetfulness and have been startled by the apparent callousness of my own country after the blood sacrifice of its youth . England is not callous . A great proof of pity and remembrance and pride was given on the last anniversary of armistice , when the body of an unknown soldier was brought down Whitehall , past the Cenotaph , on the way to a grave in the Abbey . The King and his generals waited there to salute this body of a man whom no one knew except as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom no one knew , yet was known in the hearts of all of us . In the night women came out into the streets of London to wait for the dawn , to be ready for the man who was their man ? husband or lover or brother or son . Not thousands of women , but hundreds of thousands . Men , too , mostly ex-soldiers , came to welcome back a pal who had died out there in the great comradeship of death . To each woman the unknown soldier was her man ; to each soldier his pal . There were few tears in the crowd when the coffin came , with an old tin hat and gas mask on the flag which draped it . No tears , but a wonderful silence and the spirit of remembrance . And when the coffin passed , led by the King and his generals , there was an endless line of folk passing by the Cenotaph to lay little bunches of flowers on the pedestal of that empty shrine . All through the days and nights for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a living tide flowed by , paying the homage of their souls to the dead , and for more than a week of days and nights they passed into the Abbey , to walk by the grave of the unknown soldier who was theirs . England is not callous . The soul of England remembers . But her people hide their wounds , and foreigners who go to England are startled to find so little trace of war 's  |p565  scars . They see the streets thronged by cheerful people , well dressed , well fed , prosperous-looking . " England has recovered marvelously , " they say . " She has returned to normal . She is the same old England . " That is untrue . There will never be the same old England again . It is a new and different England Not yet has the country recovered from the drains of war , nor paid the price of victory . For a long time England was the great , rich , strong country of the Allies . In the early years of war English gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse of other fighting nations . We supplied France , Italy , Russia , Greece with money and materials of war . They borrowed and borrowed from us . Then our wealth was exhausted , and it was our turn to borrow , from a nation richer than we had been . At the present time we owe 1,000 millions of pounds sterling to the American people , and we are paying the interest as it falls due , and in course of time we shall pay back the capital if America asks for it , though we are not getting interest or capital from those who owe to us , nor ever shall . Meanwhile the wealth of England is no more than the promise of the future as it may be fulfilled by the industry of the people . All the money ? the paper , anyway ? issued by the government is a promissory note on the future . Deeper and deeper the government is pledging the future in order to make present payments . The cost of carrying on the country is ten times more than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything that is essential to the life and safety of the nation or to the ambitions and purposes of English leaders . After " the war to end war " the army and navy cost 270 millions of pounds a year , which is much more than twice as much as the prewar annual budget for all the purposes of national life and progress . On our military and administrative adventure ? in Mesopotamia ? the government is spending 40 millions of pounds a year , which is a third of the annual budget before 1914 . The interest on our national debt is each year 345 millions of pounds , nearly three times as much as the prewar annual budget . To obtain this revenue the English folk are taxed beyond their patience and endurance . There is no mercy in this taxation . Capital is squeezed of all its profits now , and the profiteer is outraged by this capture of his wealth . But all employers and manufacturers are hit hard ? bludgeoned-by the tax collectors . One man I know , a big coal owner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixpence in taxation out of every twenty shillings of his revenue . The middle-class man of small fortune pays 25 per cent of his income in taxation . Money is so " tight " in England now that the banks are refusing further loans to commercial and industrial companies , and many manufacturers find it impossible to " carry on " in the present conditions of trade . They are in a tragic dilemma . The markets of central Europe , Russia , and Asia have collapsed . Those are unable to buy either manufactured goods or raw material on any scale sufficient to sustain the old prosperity of English factories . At the same time labor in England is , so far , refusing to lower its scale of wages to anything like the prewar level , or , indeed , at all , the consequence . being that the cost of production remains too high for competition in any foreign markets that remain , and the retail prices in England are not falling , and can not fall , to their old level . Capital itself is nervous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is now challenging the whole position of labor by declaring a lockout , closing down factories , and biding its time until the rising tide of unemployment ? a tidal wave at this moment ? brings the workingmen to their senses . Unless they reduce their wage claims England will soon be threatened with bankruptcy . What is the character and temper of  |p566  English labor ? Upon that answer depends not only the future of England , and of the British Empire , but to a great extent the future of white civilization in Europe . For England is still the rock upon which the European nations largely cling for safety ? a moral as well as a material rock . If England were to go the way of revolution , or fall into chaos and anarchy , it is my firm conviction that there would be no hope at all for Europe , which would fall rapidly itself into decay and despair . France can not save herself without English help ; Italy can not ; there would be no indemnities from Germany . Russian Bolshevism would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon defenseless minorities ; the moral structure of Europe would collapse . All that is certain , beyond all argument or dispute . What , then , is the character and temper of English labor ? It is truculent , aggressive , and , in minorities here and there , revolutionary . The actual labor leaders , men like Thomas , G. N. Barnes , Clynes , Lansbury , and others , are more moderate than the rank and file behind them . Thomas especially is a man of statesmanlike views , much education and experience , who has no desire to become a revolutionary figure or to wreck the machine of labor organization by vioIent and shattering conflict . Behind the moderate leaders , however , there is a strong pressure of younger and more reckless men who are eager to use the power of the trade-union for political as well as economic purposes ? which is a new claim as far as English labor is concerned . Several times they have tried their strength in this way , with doubtful results , because it is contrary to the instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deciding factor in English life . The attempt of the coal miners to dictate the policy of the government beyond the arbitrament of wages , to regulate prices to the consumer , failed quickly and resulted in surrender . But there was recently another action on the part of organized labor which proved the political power of their organization when supported by the general conviction of the country . It was when there was a rumor , not unsupported by evidence , that the government proposed to raise a military expedition for the attempted overthrow of the Soviet regime in Russia , in defense of Poland . This was more than mere popular rumor . It was sufficiently grave to cause a leading article in the London Times announcing that England was as near to a new great war , calling upon all the strength and sacrifice of the people , as in 1914 . The trade-unions set up overnight a central committee which they called a Council of Action , and sent word to the government that the whole power of organized labor in England would be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no intention of preparing a new military expedition . . . . It did not take place . At the present time English labor is again taking action in the political sphere by threatening a general strike if the government maintains its repressive policy in Ireland by means of " reprisals " and other acts of terrorism . All this is undoubtedly revolutionary in its spirit . It is a new phase of the labor movement in England , which up to recent years was entirely limited to the economic conditions of industrial life . It is stoked up and inflamed by the outpost leaders of Bolshevism who have established themselves strongly in Glasgow , Liverpool , and Wales . They are out for destruction . They want to smash all the structure of English government , all order , all law . They are in direct touch with Russian and other foreign Communists , and they do not shrink from the thought of the same methods and the same results as those in the Russian upheaval . Lately , however , the Communist theory has been discredited and largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom , for a time , were inclined to believe that this was the new and true gospel of demo/ cratic progress . The visits of English labor leaders to Russia , and their unanimous condemnation of the Bolshevik autocracy and the slave state of the Russian workers , undeceived the majority even of the younger hotheads . But , although the philosophy of Communism has been dropped like a sharp-edged weapon cutting the hand that held it , there is still a vague , loose , and dangerous current of revolutionary impulse in English labor ranks , not less menacing because undecided in its purpose . The present wave of unemployment , which many of the workers believe to be deliberately engineered by employers in order to keep down prices , is intensifying the spirit of revolt , and of challenge to the present order of things . It is patronized , rather flattered , by a number of the younger intellectuals , who play about with the idea of revolution as children with fire , not knowing that they will be burned up if the red embers jump out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coalition government since the war have created a sense of exasperation and distrust in the minds of the people , and at the present time there is a wide , unbridgeable gulf between that government and the spirit and ideals of the nation as a whole . The capitalist , as well as the workingman , is aghast at the reckless expenditure of the government on imperial adventures , on the army and navy , and on purposes that seem to them wasteful and sinister . Disappointment with the effects of peace , the increasing troubles of industry , the spread of social decay in central Europe , the burden of armaments still pressing heavily , and the fear of new wars have reacted against all confidence in the men who still control the destiny of England . They have settled nothing . They have failed in the larger vision . They are acting in Ireland with passion and no wisdom . They have tried to buy off trouble in England by promises which can not be redeemed . This failure ? almost inevitable without great leadership , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to unpleasant events , serious disturbances , in the order of English life . And the state of Europe , its general malady , is beginning to touch England very closely . Yet , though I see the gravity of all this and its darkness , I believe that England will pull through and carry on . There is in English character still an intuitive , inarticulate wisdom . In spite of all the modifications caused by war , there is a solid common sense , a sense of compromise and the middle way , which belongs to centuries of English tradition and is not yet deadened . The passion of the extremists leaves the main body of English men and women cold as ice . Discontent , distress , exasperation lead to violent speech , but rarely to violent action , within the heart of England untouched by the fire of the Celtic fringe . In the past centuries there have been worse times than now , but the people have suffered them with patience , with hard resolution , with high and noble valor . They have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of present trouble England will emerge with her old spirit of stolidity , resource , and energy . If not , then other peoples will be hurt , grievously . If England goes down in decay , so will all Europe , and even America will not be . scatheless . If the British Empire , dependent still on England as the axle wheel of its progress , breaks up or falls apart , there will be a flaming anarchy in its ancient possessions ? in India , Egypt , Africa ? before which the horrors of the last war will be but playful things . If the English people take the road to revolution no country will be safe for democracy or in any way secure of life , and white civilization , as we now know it , and like it , will be doomed . Other races , not white , will press forward over our ruin and decadence . But that , by the grace of God and the spirit of a great race , shall not happen yet , unless madness overtakes all sanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
