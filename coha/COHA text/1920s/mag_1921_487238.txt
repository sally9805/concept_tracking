Last week 's instalment of the Diary closed by telling how Sir Roger 's confidential man , Adler Christensen , returned to the hotel in Christiania and threw down some money which he said had been given to him at the British Legation . The Diary itself does not tell more of this incident , but it is set forth in detail below from memoranda written by Sir Roger late in 1914 and early in 1915 . CHAPTER III T HE story , in brief , was this : When Adler had had his breakfast after leaving me about 9 a. in. , he had been in the large hall of the hotel , when a stranger brushed against him and said quickly : " Go to the telephone booth and call up No. 11460 and you will hear something good . " Adler did as directed , but before ringing up 11460 he requested the Central Office of the Telephone  --  a government department  --  to " listen to the following conversation . " He then called up the number given and was told in answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This he did , and noted the number of the taxicab for future reference : viz. , No. 0.4085 . On reaching the Legation he was shown up by the servant and by a " gentleman with gray hair " whom he believed to be the Secretary to the same room where the previous day 's interview had taken place . Here he found a new gentleman ? " a very tall man , clean-shaven except for a short grayish mustache , with his hair brushed back straight , and dressed in a tweed suit . " This gentleman at once began proceedings by an- * Copyright . 1921. by Charles E. Curry . All rights reserved . Previous instalments of the Diary appeared in The Nation for November 30 and December 7. flouncing " I am the British Minister " and locking the door . He instantly plunged in medias res , and unfolded his intentions toward myself with a boldness.that , as Adler said , quite won his admiration  --  but not his sympathy . He began by telling my man he knew all about him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you sent a telegram from Christiansand to your father , and yesterday you sent a cablegram from your friend Mr. ? to New York ; now I want the original of that cablegram to have his handwriting . " He went on to say that he knew all about me ; that I was " Sir Roger " and that I was going to Germany , he was sure , to conspire with the Germans about Ireland . He said the Irish had rebelled before but " Did he tell you they ever succeeded ? " " They will not succeed this time either . He is going to be fooled by the Germans ; they do n't care anything about Ireland and only want to make trouble for England . " This and more , in an extreme frankness and boldness . Adler made no protest when my right name was mentioned and as the Minister proceeded he appeared to be influenced by his argument and to sympathize with the Minister 's point of view as between England and Germany . After this dissertation on the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Cardonnel Findlay came to the point , on the clear assumption that the man before him was a mercenary ruffian who would carry out his wishes for a suitable reward . He said he wished greatly to stop my getting to Germany and suggested it might be managed . Adler said I had been " very good " to him and had " befriended him when in trouble " and that I " trusted him implicitly . " Mr.- Findlay met this by pointing out that I was entirely defenseless in Norway , with no friends to appeal to and no government to raise inquiry if I " disappeared . " " Ile can not claim to be Mr. , because his papers are false and the true Mr. ? is in New York . The American Legation can not intervene , because he does n't belong to them ; the German Minister dare not ; and we should protect and help whoever got him for us . " He then suggested my being made away with in a cold-blooded hint on which Adler Christensen is quite clear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " but suggested what he wanted thus : He said , " I suppose you would not mind having an easy time all the rest of your life , with nothing to do ? Well now , this man could be got out of the way , and no one will know . If some one knocked him on the head he would get well paid for it . " Adler protested that whoever did that would get into trouble and pay the penalty , but Mr. Findlay pointed out that there could be no inquiry , as " no one would disappear . " Sir Roger was not in Norway  --  and " Mr. was in New York . " He went on to say that anything done to me would be very well paid for indeed  --  and that I might be " got hold of " and handed over to the British Government . He terminated the interview , of which the foregoing is only a compressed synopsis , by giving Adler twenty-five kronen in notes , " for your taxicab fares , " and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree , come here at three o'clock this afternoon . " I reported this colloquy to Count v. Oberndorff when he and Mr. Hilmers ( joined later by Mr. Richard Meyer , who had just arrived as a " fireman " from Baltimore ) called at the hotel to see me . I determined that my man should return at 3 o'clock to the British Minister to hear the end of the story , so that I might be made fully aware of the completed plans of the excellent British representative . . After concluding all arrangements for my departure that evening , I bade Count v. Oberndorff goodby . It was arranged that Mr. Hilmers and some friends should " see " me safely from the hotel to the station where I would join Mr. Meyer on his way to Berlin ( at 2:45 p. m. ) , without themselves being seen in my company . I sent Adler back to 79 Drammensveien after having coached him in the part he was to play . As the man put it himself : " Oh ! I can pretend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Findlay heard the full definition of himself given to me by this Norwegian sailor boy I wonder what his greeting of Adler Christensen would have been ! I waited in some anxiety I must admit . I was exposing this young man , whose life since he was a little boy of twelve had been one of great hardship , to a very great temptation . I knew that , and told him so . I assured him that the British Government would indeed pay a big price for me and that he " could sell me dear . " His role was to pretend that , having considered the Minister 's offer , he was prepared to fall in with his schemes and betray me in return for an ample reward . The price was to be a high one ; otherwise the enemy might suspect his compliance was assumed . Adler was to explain to the Minister that I had booked for Copenhagen in that evening 's train , and that it was my intention to stay there some days , he thought . I was going to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Minister came to terms he would urge me to take him on with me and as " I liked him and trusted him so much " he was sure , if he begged me , I would do this . Then he would be able to carry out whatever plan against me the Minister proposed . Such was the instruction given him as he went off to his third visit to the British Legation . He took a taxicab , whose number was 0.1525 and as a precaution for further reference he told the car to wait outside for him . ( He paid - the driver seven kronen . ) He was at once shown up to the same room , where Mr. Findlay was employed in calling someone up on the telephone . The Minister explained he was getting an address he needed for possible correspondence with Adler . The interview that followed was a lengthy one , for it was nearly five o'clock when Adler returned to my room in the hotel . I had meantime got my sleeping-car ticket for Copenhagen and had given the hotel people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown more than anxious at the long delay , for I had told Adler to come back quickly ; and as five o'clock approached I began to fear either that he had succumbed to an overwhelming temptation , or , more likely , that the Minister was going to keep him locked up , and try some project against me when I should be deprived of my faithful man and ignorant of the nature of the attempt . I accordingly wrote a brief note for v. Oberndorff , which I proposed giving at the station to Mr. Hilmers , in which I explained that my man had gone to the Legation at 3 o'clock and that , as he had not returned before I left , I was in fear that something was wrong and requested that the man 's father at Moss and the Christiania police might be informed . Just as I was going to leave my room to descend to the hall , Adler returned and handed me a hundred-kronen Norwegian note , the " first proceeds " of his new role of assassin extraordinary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I can do no more than give the heads of it here . From the first the two appeared to understand each other . Adler said he showed plainly that he was a blackguard himself and took the Minister at the same valuation . The interview should have been historic . The young Norwegian behaved even insolently  --  smoked his pipe , kept his hands in his pockets , held profane language , and nearly quarreled with his patron . At one point they reached such high words that Mr. Findlay said : " What is to prevent my keeping you here , and not letting you out ? " To which the Norwegian said with a laugh : " That should do you no good , because you ca n't find anything on me . " The understanding arrived at was that Adler was to remain in my service and do his best to get me decoyed to some place " anywhere on the Skagerrak or North Sea " where I might be captured by British men-of-war . These , if advice were given beforehand , would rush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ! Adler was also to try to - get my letters , find out with whom I corresponded , especially in Ireland , " so that they may be arrested , " and in general keep the Minister apprised of my plans , movements , and aims  --  but above all he was to try and get me , in person , handed over to them , and as much " proof " as possible against me and my Irish associates . For this service  --  the day I was " procured " in body and delivered to the British ? Mr. Findlay guaranteed to Adler " on my honor " the sum of ? 5,000 sterling . This amount he promised faithfully , adding that he would telegraph that day to London to know what further sum " my Government " would offer . To Adler 's requests for assurances as to the sum and its being surely paid him , the Minister said : " You must trust me and my word of honor . " It was then they had come to high words and Adler had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally the bargain was struck and Mr. Findlay , taking a sheet of a Legation writing paper , tore off the printed address at the top and wrote in printed characters , " so as to hide his handwriting : " " Herr Sigvitg Sigvwitg , Meyersgate 78 , " the name and address of the person in Christiania to whom Adler was to report progress . This paper he handed to Adler with an explanation of how the correspondence was to be conducted . Adler was to write an apparently harmless letter about anything at all , of which only every fourth word counted in the real message intended . Finally he gave him the hundred-kronen note , saying : " Up to this you have done nothing and told me nothing . This is all the money I have on me . " Adler had referred contemptuously to this " five dollar bill " ( with an epithet ! ) and had pointed out that he wanted " good money " and must be paid in sums in advance  --  as he needed money and wanted to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind at rest I went to the station , seeing the friendly eye of Mr. Hilmers in the hotel hall ; and on the station platform that gentleman with a body of sturdy " friends " seeing Mr. Meyer off . Adler booked for Copenhagen . It was arranged that at Engelholm Junction where our train was due at 5 ; 40 a. in . I should leave the Copenhagen section , and change into the Sassnitz section , alongside Mr. Meyer . This was done . I believe that a man from the British Legation , in the belief that I was going to Copenhagen , had taken passage in the same train . If so , he found out only in the morning , either at Helsingborg or across the Sound , the change of plan ; and I was then well on the way to Traelleborg . We reached Berlin that evening at 7:30 . At this point the Diary is resumed . Berlin , 31 October , 1914 Meyer had intended to take me to the Palast Hotel  --  near the Foreign Office  --  but on ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him amazed and said it had been closed since the beginning of the war ; so we were driven instead to the Continental where Meyer got rooms for me under the name of " Mr. Hammond . " I had decided to bury Mr. ? on the shores of the Baltic after we had traversed the customs inspection there . The management were impressed by Meyer and were all bows and smiles  --  and so I was duly registered as " Mr. Hammond of New York , " and they were told they would be responsible to the German Foreign Office if anything unpleasant occurred to me . Meyer soon left me for the Foreign Office to report our arrival and to arrange for me to see some of them tomorrow . He begged me not to go out , or let Adler out , until the police had been advised  --  as English-speaking men , without papers , etc. , and unknown to the police , would surely get into trouble . So we both stayed in the hotel , and I had a quiet and lonely dinner in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the effort perhaps only begun ! Shall I succeed ? Will they see the great cause aright and understand all it may mean to them , no less than to Ireland ? Tomorrow will show the beginning . 1 November , 1914 The hotel is comfortable and quiet . Very few guests . When I came down to luncheon a man at a table near , hearing my order given in English , glared stealthily and then gotup and went out . I knew by instinct he had gone to the office to ask about the visitor who spoke English. - Presently he returned and resumed his meal ; but when I had done mine , he stood up and came over and stood beside me. 5o I said " Good day " in English and he pointed out a gregt portrait of the Emperor and two other pictures , and walked me round to see them . As his English was not much more vigorous than my German , we soon bowed and parted . I did not go out all day . Meyer called twice , to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chancellor , von Bethrnann-Hollweg , and the Secretary of State , von Jagow , both with the Emperor at the French Front  --  at Charleville , I gathered later . At the Foreign Office only the Under Secretary of State , Zimmermann , and the Staff . The second visit of Meyer , in the evening , was to tell me that I should be received by the Under Secretary on Monday morning at 11:30 ; and that meantime they had discussed the Christiania incident and he had shown them the document and the kronen notes and explained the attempt on me ; and that they would like to hear more of it also . Anyhow he showed me plainly I was a- welcome guest , and I felt as easy in mind as it is possible to be in so strange a position . Here I am in the heart of the enemy 's conntry  --  a state guest and almost a state prisoner ;
