Hell-Bent for Heaven . The Pulitzer Prize play for 1924 has been made over into a motion picture with more effect than usual . The film has not , naturally , retained the full , true purpose of the play . But it has a splendid flood . It deals with a boy who got religion at a camp meeting . <P> Skinner 's Dress Suit . An old picture , made over from an Essanay release of the old , old days , reappears genially enough . It is , as you may gather from the title , a comedy about a man named Skinner who was the proud possessor of a dress suit . Reginald Denny and Laura La Plante have the leads . <P> Brown of Harvard . Donald Ogden Stewart , humorist , has been put to work by Hollywood and has emerged with a very amusing college picture . In the old play the sport concerned was boating , while in this version the big scene takes place at the annual football game . There is also love .
