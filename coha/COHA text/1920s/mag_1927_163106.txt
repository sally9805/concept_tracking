Three U. S. Senators . The unfolding progress of the Chinese Nationalist advance upon Peking ( TIME , March 28 et seq. ) loomed with such vital portent last week that three U. S. Senators were busy in China , making personal investigations on the spot . Senator Hiram Bingham , Connecticut Republican , pushed his tour of China ( TIME , May 9 ) to the extreme of venturing 400 miles up the great river Yangtze , last week into the very heart of " Chinese Communist " territory . Since he traveled on a U. S. warboat , the Senator was effusively greeted at Hankow by the " Communist " Foreign Minister Eugene Chen ( TIME , Jan. 24 ) . Later Mr. Bingham pushed on to Ichang , in the extreme upper reaches of the Yangtze . <P> The two other Senators , less daring , merely stopped off at Shanghai . They were Senator Burton Kendall Wheeler , Montana Democrat , en route to the U. S. from the Philippines , and Senator Guy Despard Goff , West Virginia Republican , en route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deposed heir to the vanished Manchu Empire of China , a modest youth , Henry P'u-Yi ( TIME , March 16 , 1925 ) was interviewed last week for the first time in many months , at his refuge-residence in the Japanese quarter of Tientsin . Said he : <P> " What do we see in China today ? Nothing but maladministration , treachery , bribery , and wars . China is suffering more than anything else from too many rotten generals . They are everywhere , fighting and marching , backward and forward-not for China , but for their own personal gain . <P> " It is no sinecure to be emperor today . A good emperor must be a representative of and father of his people , and I am not good enough morally or mentally to be father to the people of China . I am sure the time will come when there will again be an emperor in united China , but it must be somebody greater than I. " <P> Scowling Marshal . Not without boldness did Henry P'u-Yi speak of China 's " rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke two of these generals were entering into an alliance , preparing to march upon Tientsin and Peking with 200,000 men . <P> Suchowfu , 400 miles from Peking , was the auspicious scene upon which this alliance was struck up . Came the Nationalist Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ( TIME , Oct. 4 ) whose armies , originally one with the Hankow " Communist " forces , have now conquered the Southern half of China . Then , amid cheers and bugle blasts , came the great Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang-an abundant fellow , massive , barrel-sized , jowled like a tiger , and last week unshaven , scowling , imperious in the pride of his new power . <P> Just 14 months ago ( TIME , April 12 , 1926 ) , Feng Yu-hsiang was driven from Peking by the great Manchurian War Lord Chang Tso-lin , who is still supreme there . Marshal Feng retreated into Mongolia , consolidated his forces there , then hurried to Moscow where he allegedly obtained enormous grants of gold , supplies , arms , ammunition . Therefore it was pretty to see last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is not a Communist , yet carefully did not disavow or antagonize the Soviet Government . <P> Ultimatum . Feng Yu-hsiang made known his stand to Chiang Kai-shek by announcing that he had sent an " ultimatum " to the Chinese " Communists " at Hankow , thus :
