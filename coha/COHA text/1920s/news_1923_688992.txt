txt It is understood that Premier Baldwin of Great Britain will come to Paris for an allied conference . following the conversations next week in Brussels between Premier Poincare of France and Premier Theunis of Belgium . It is possible that Premier Mussolini may come from Rome and that then all the allied Premiers may be here about the time the new German reparation offer is expected . This is what Belgium wishes . and French opinion is becoming much better inclined toward Baldwin since he took power ten days ago . It is thought he has shown a general disposition to arrange international difficulties , especially with France . It was announced today that Great Britain had agreed not to press for a League of Nations investigation of the Sarre situation on the promise that the rigid French measures which are causing criticism shall be temporary . The French Government this afternoon announced to the British Government that it opposed any investigation by the League of Nations into the Sarre . The French Government does not deny the right of the League to make such an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only within the last month renewed an expression of confidence in the Commission and approved the very ordinances which caused the English criticism , it is held that an investigation would create a misunderstanding and a condition contrary to good order in the territory . Only yesterday the long standing quarrel between Great Britain and France over Morocco was settled , and it is expected that an amicable arrangement of the Tangier quarrel will be found , probably by installing the League of Nations in that much internationalized town . Mr. Baldwin also gave the word which brought a settlement of the debate over the costs of the American Army of Occupation . In this he accepted the French view . So the impression is growing in France that he is willing to make sacrifices to reach a compromise . Since Mr. Baldwin has apparently decided to take a more active role in the reparation negotiations than Bonar Law . it is not unreasonable to expect results from his coming visit to the French capital , where it is believed the man who arranged Great Britain 's debt to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is. however . a much harder task , because of the wider interests involved , and because the conditions surrounding the problem are more intricate . Nothing is to be said on the probable fate of any new German offer until more is known of its terms . It means very little whether the Germans will offer thirty or forty or fifty billion marks gold . All depends on whether Berlin is talking of present value or referring to the total payments to be scattered over many years . The technical total of reparations now stands at 132,000,000,000 marks , but the present value of that is 68,000.000,000. of which France 's share Is 24,000,000,000 : England 's 14.000.000.000 and Belgium 's 5,000,000.000 . When one recalls that France owes Great Britain the equivalent of 14,000 , - 1 ) 00.000 gold marks , it is seen that cancellation of this would reduce what is coming to France from Germany in the general adjustment to 20,000,000.000 marks current value . If England maintained her claim on Germany , which is about 14,000.000,000 marks , with a deduction through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's giving up pension claims . the total present value of Germany 's obligations would come below 50,000.000.000 gold marks , an amount which many experts believe Germany can pay . This is one way of looking at the problem , which has as many angles as a fine cut diamond . But this is the way the British looked at the problem when they brought over their January plan which the French refused . Whether the French will take a different view of this offer , now that they hold the Ruhr , is a question that BaidwIn will try to get answered before he comes over . The proposal made in London yesterday for an investigation of Germany 's capacity to pay by the International Chamber of Commerce has been coolly received here . A statement this afternoon by the French branch of the International Chamber says that it will not take part in any such effort and that these matters should be left to the Government , which has steadfastly refused to have any inquiries by an international am:mission.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
