WHEN I began to be wonted to the long , winding kingdom of my shallow , underwater world , my first fine frenzy of inarticulate emotion at its strange landscapes and stranger inhabitants slowly changed to more specific appreciation . And the very first evidence of this was humorous ? for I began to see close resemblances between these villagers of the deep and dear friends of mine . This is not to be read with a roar of laughter and an allinclusive pseudo-witticism of queer looking people and " poor fish . " That is far from what I mean ; it was in no way a question of special features or personal appearance , but often a matter of quite indefinable qualities : the way a grouper would come over a mound of coral , or a moorish idol peer up at me , the nervous flick of a small wrasse person brought often to mind a gait , a glance , or a trick of the hand of some acquaintance . These casual chuckles undermined the distraction of alienness , and at once I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again in one spot , day after day , and saw , not only the same lanes and streets and mountains , but the identical fish themselves . The little old lady in Paris , garbed in black who used to pass me on her way to market every day had always the same tear in her veil ; and now , the small fussy demoiselle fishlet which invariably scurried past when I had taken my seat was known to me among all her neighbors by the frayed spot on the side of her fin . I succeeded in merging myself into the life of fishes , aided by the lack of fear , or even respect , with which they greetedmy entrance into their world . But when I began to think in words , I found that just as I had to have a stream of atmosphere flowing down to me , bringing with it all the little motes and beams belonging wholly to the upper world , so when my mind began resolving into outflowing words what my senses had sent to it , these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye above the water my new kingdom 's limits within the confines of these Cocos and Galapagos Islands would appear like a multitude of thinnest of rings scattered about just beneath the surface . For this is an egocentric kingdom as far as I am concerned , and its lower boundaries are those of my limited extremes of penetration . As for the upper frontiers , I admit neither rock nor weed ever bathed by the air even at lowest tide . All between I have made mine by right of imagination and a few score of timid entrances and creepings about . Yet always , while among my subjects , I must abide in a glass house and , like a humble water beetle , enclose within it a bubble of air . My impatience never ceases to desire to fling the glass windows wide open , and smell and taste and hear this new world ? to hear , for there must be some rippling vibration of sound or other waves from so many thousands who forever mumble at one another with their lips . One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the east side of Chatham Bay , Cocos . Just as Cocos itself at this season was more often than not completely cloaked in a solid rain cloud , so my capital was forever hidden from prying eyes by a liquid sheet of emeraldgreen . Before describing an earthly city we always speak of its environment and background . What I saw as 1 looked around above water just before 1 dived was a sort of upground ? I know of no other word ? the beautiful , great bay with the Arcturus riding at anchor , while high overhead rose the steep mountain slopes of Cocos , covered with dense green jungles , tall palms and graceful , lacelike tree-ferns standing out above all the rest , while fig trees clung to the steepest slopes , dropping down perfect porti ? res of dangling rootlets . In and out , like a warp of silver threads among the green foliage , shone the waterfalls ? the glory of all this island loveliness , dozens of them , slipping down from rock to rock or sliding gently over hundred-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet is poised on high , dropped over my head ? I am eclipsed , and change planets . I sink down , down , down , and finally let go the last rung , drop quietly and deliberately on my feet , and look around at a city of giant mushrooms . A huge dome in front of me offered good climbing , so I kicked my feet and body free , and drifted to the top with slight tugs of my hands , gravitation all but negatived . From the top I looked down upon a marvelous boulevard of the whitest sand , bordered by edifices of coral beyond all adequate adjective and exclamation . In the middle distance I saw the palace of the Dalai Lama at Lhasa with its majestic down-dropping lines ; beyond it , the corals had wrought a fairy replica of the temple of the Tirthankers at Benares . Then a cloud of pagodas filled the end of the sandy vista , silhouetted against the blue , at which I can never cease marveling whenever I think of this water world ? a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some still more distant monument . Invariably the architecture of the East was brought to mind , notthe semi-plagerized structures of most of our western efforts , but light , uplifted pagoda roofs , curving domes , and stalagmite minarets , together with the scroll-work which is lacelike but never gingerbready . Through many days of watching ? sometimes rising to the surface , gray with the soaking of water , or chilled and chattering , but always reluctantly ? I studied the fishes , the aborigines of these places , and found them astonishingly like humans in all their more important habits and concerns of life . Looking over my finny subjects in general , I found they were divided into distinct gens or castes , and these in turn separated more or less naturally into guilds and professions . From my seat at one end of the mushroom city I could pick them out ? sometimes several at a glance . Over the coral , above its mounds and branches and labyrinths , there floated the castes of Free Nomads and Grazers . Shall I call them figuratively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with rather more exactness of applicability , the eagles and vultures , the parrots and woodpeckers ? Or , best of all , let us credit them exactly for what they are . As Nomads I should consider those fish people who usually hunt singly , but sometimes in small packs , who have no homes , no coral haunts or rocky retreats , but who live , feed , fight , mate , sleep , and die in mid-water . The sharks are these , yet not the rays and skates , which belong to the same natural order , but which have spread into various directions and appropriated an interesting and profitable field for themselves . Indeed , in the ease of the sharks , what has not been usurped by them has been given them as endowment by legend and fancy . We humans adore to build up a scarecrow of straw and paper around things admirable in themselves , inflate it with hot air , then look at it , scream , and run terrified away . Cries of Snake ! Evolution ! Shark ! are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified terror . All these fears have about the same basis of truth ; out of seventeen hundred species of serpents living on the earth to-day less than one-third are harmful ; undoubtedly there have been a few men who were at the same time , very bad men and believers in evolution ; and there is no doubt that a few authentic cases of the attacks of sharks upon men have occurred . To condemn sharks in general is like never taking a taxicab because men have been run over and killed by taxicabs . I have written elsewhere of individual sharks I have met , but here we are concerned only with their relations to the scheme of the shallow-water world . At Cocos there weaved in and out above me , occasionally coming down and curving around the great coral pagodas , sharks of three species . The white-finned and the Galapagos sharks were wandering nomads of distinctly vulturine habits , arousing no fear among smaller or weaker fish , but always on the lookout for a crippled or dead creature . They were the dominant scavengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and the frigate birds above cleared away every specimen , no matter how small , that had been overlooked . These two kinds of gray sharks were four to seven feet in length , and they swam slowly with wide lateral undulations of the head and body , keeping rather a dull outlook from their yellow eyes . The ability of the human imagination to see what it thinks it ought to see is astonishing . As long as my bookand - legend - induced fear of sharks dominated , I saw them as sinuous , crafty , sinister , cruel-mouthed , sneering . When I came at last to know them for harmless scavengers , all these characteristics slipped away , and I saw them as they really are ? indolent , awkward , chinless cowards . They are to a barracuta as a vulture to an eagle ; a ladyfish has a thousand times less weight and double their courage . As regards tiger sharks ? which by the way , attain a length of thirty feet in my kingdom ? I reserve judgment . I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of nothing more alarming than curiosity ; but I have also seen a tiger shark snap up a baby sea lion close to a rookery of big males as though it were a minnow , and I have observed and shared the respect with which fish greet his appearance . I should catalogue him as an uncertain character ? safe enough usually , but to be interviewed with the iron ladder between us . Groupers are another tribe of Nomads , one without any sense of humor or the sophisticated casualness which seems to me to characterize most sharks . Groupers take life in grim earnest and , while they lack the pessimistic viciousness of bermcutas and morays , yet they are persons of uncertain temper . Lack of size alone keeps them from being as much feared as tiger sharks . I was never wholly comfortable when these great brutes came up in their loose schools of six or eight , swimming so close that I often kicked at them or stabbed with my harpoon . Their reaction , after avoiding the stroke , was instantly to return and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . No shark was quicker ? nor by a long ways as effective ? in attack upon any fish in trouble or disabled as were these evil-mouthed fish . Once I saw a giant ray or devilfish while I was perched on a coral throne . Dense schools of small fish passing overhead dimmed the light as would a cloud , but this huge creature actually caused a momentary eclipse as he flew close above me , so close indeed and so far beneath the top of the water that my companions did not notice him . My delight at seeing his enormous enamel-white expanse overhead was temporarily distracted by one of his wing tips catching in my hose of life , but it slipped around with no more than a sudden twitch to the helmet . I entered him in my census file as Nomad , unique so near shore , harmless , curious , playful , feeding on nothing more exciting than the minute shrimps and infant crabs which paddle about near the surface , especially at night . All this I had gleaned from others of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elsewhere and always close to the top of the water . Devilfish he may be in appearance because of his horns and tail and the color of his cloak , but he has a gentle soul . This giant must have a courtship of sorts and a consorting for a time with a mate , but I have found him the most solitary of behemoths . The last member of the tribe of True Nomads and far and away my favorite , is a splendid blue carangid , two feet or more in length and swifter than any other . In clans of ten or a dozen they come out of the translucent blue and , as they approach , slip off the azure veil which dims them and flash out pure silver , for , from my position , I see them with the eye of a true dweller in these deeps . They are built with the finest of stream lines , narrow tail peduncle aft , wide crescentic tail , long , falcate pectorals . Around and around me they go , arousing keen interest and admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt that these were fish of caste , fighting , if they must , in the open . Their relation to other smaller fish was a mystery or else to be explained by sleight-of-fin legerdemain . None paid any more attention to them than to the Grazers . Yet these were of a far other sort . Three separate times I saw one of these carangids move out of the circle they were drawing around me , with a twist and a flash as quick as light , and each time a small wrasse swimming near absolutely disappeared . It reminded me of the frog-and-his-tongue trick ? a frog facing a fly a considerable distance away , and suddenly the fly is gone . You are sure it went down the frog 's throat , but no human eye is quick enough to see all the details . And so the flash of silver caranx seems not to approach or touch the little wrasse ? and yet the wrasse is no longer interested in food or life and the caranx is back in place , swimming quietly , breathing gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take no bait and they avoided the repeated stabs of my grains with less than effort , and only when we took advantage of them with a stick of dynamite was I able to name them for certain , Caranx melampygus , and to study their marvelous body engine at leisure . I learned as much as any instantaneous cross-section could provide , of which one fact only is of interest here . A female with ripe ovaries was about to deposit one hundred and fourteen thousand eggs . This showed clearly that , no matter how well able the full-grown fish are to take care of themselves , the young fry must be threatened with a host of dangers to render such a number of eggs necessary to maintain the species . To return in this connection , for a moment , to another Nomad : let us consider the devilfish which produces but a single young weighing nearly thirty pounds at birth . On this very trip I examined such a lusty infant and could see no means of defense by which it could excape the attack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a year of and do nothing but study the life history of the devilfish . Once when a small boy I was studying the common bird life of a small city park . I looked up one day and saw a brilliant parrot perched in a tree overhead . The thrill which came to me then was repeated when , almost on the last day of my diving at Cocos I saw a beautiful flying fish swimming over my mushroom coral city . I had hardly registered it when the reason for its presence in this unlikely spot was explained . A long narrow fish came up behind , slowly at first , then with a rush ? a needle-toothed garfish . The flying fish gave two or three convulsive surges forward and then I saw what I had never expected to ? one of these fish rise from the water above me and disappear into the air . Somehow this made me feel more like one of the actual inhabitants of this underworld than anything which had occurred heretofore ? I was seeing things from a real fish-eye-view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested to see that he became utterly confused and made one short rush after the other in various directions . I saw the flying fish drop into the water only twenty feet away , coming into view with a flop . The gar showed no signs of having sensed this , and the last I saw of the two , the pursued was vanishing into the blue distance while the gar turned back the way it had come . The last Nomad I can recall does not really belong in this class , since it has a home , although the strangest in the world . When the devilfish swam over I saw very distinctly two sucking fish glued to its under side . These are the remarkable attendants which spend their whole life being carried about by their host , whether shark , devilfish , or turtle ; so if not comparable to the nomadic Arab , they can at least qualify as the representative of the Arab 's flea . I stood up on III the top of the great coral mass , which I might , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle View , " and slipped , or rather drifted half way to the bottom . Then with a mighty spring I passed slowly but quite across the sandy boulevard and beyond to another city , this one of cones , inverted cones at that , like enormous anemones . The swell was increasing and far off at one side I could see the iron ladder frantically jerking up and down . Hardly had I curled myself in between three small cones , with a branching tangle of animal blossoms in front , when there occurred that dimming of the light with which I had become so familiar . Leisurely there passed overhead three hundred ? three hundred and twenty-six to be exact ? of the big , black surgeonfish . They wandered over to the great brown coral which I had left , and spread over it like a herd of sheep across a meadow ? nibble , nibble , nibble , as they climbed slowly , drawing the black blanket of their numbers over every inchof surface . A strong surge swept them a yard away , held them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his place on the coral . To my coarse and untutored vision each retreating surge seemed to restore things exactly as they were and yet , if I could see all the hidden activities of my kingdom , I should know that every swell , each minute and each hour , must cause a thousand thousand tragedies ? exposing to hostile , alien eyes , hidden weakness and camouflaged defenselessness . Not a moment passes but somewhere a color secret is exploded , an inedible bluff called , for even a fish 's memory with hunger as the stimulus can span ten feet and two seconds . As the buffalo herons and cowbirds and black cuckoos gather about grazing cattle , to snatch the disturbed grasshoppers , so , on the outskirts of the surgeon herd , small wrasse persons and others frisked about , darting in to seize some crab or shrimp which the scraping teeth of the grazing fish had dispossessed . Again , as in grazing herds of antelope in Africa , a zebra will now and then be found , so here , mingled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-striped angelfish and as many of my old friends , the yellow-tailed Xesurus . Fish such as these I take as types of my Grazers ? Coral Grazers in particular . My study of the yellow-tailed surgeons applies , with slight changes , to the others ? fish which swim slowly about , often in large schools , usually at a low level near the coral or rocks . They are apparently well protected by the poisonous spines on various parts of the body and show no fear of other fish . They may be somber in general body-color but they always have some conspicuous mark or patch of color , such as the yellow tail of Xesurus , the white tail of Alicia , and the black bands in another surgeon . But however they differ in size , color , or sociability , they have one thing in common ? their teeth . One glance at the mouth of a lion , a horse , or a rabbit tells us much of their SLUMBERERS OF THE SURGE P.9 ways of life and their food ; and no one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shark or even a snapper . My Grazers , judged by their teeth , fell into four general types : the Hands-and feet , the Chisel or Horse-toothed , the Stockades , and the Parrots . The first I might describe as six and thirty little soles sticking up all on edge ; and in Hepatus , another surgeon , the teeth are absurdly like hands , palms out , with the fingers held close together . This fish is content with algae , as I have never found a crab or other marine animal in its food . The triggerfish are armed with the dental chisels , Meliehthys , the beautiful black trigger , and the solitary , and preternaturally solemn Packygnathus . The front view of these fish presents a horrible horselike appearance , a horse whose teeth are too prominent and too many . The stockades are a strange group , with teeth which far excel any instrument of human manufacture . Details are for the ichthyologist ; but consider for a moment the Moorish idol and the angelfish . The astonishingly beautiful white-striped angelfish has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick , bony jaw . Back of the front row are four or five layers of teeth , appearing above the jaw in short lengths , looking , on the whole , like a strip of ticker tape or pianola music . But Poma.eanthits zonipectus , or more trippingly on the tongue , orange-finned butterfly-fish , has the most bizarre mouthful of any of my Grazers . At first sight it seems to have a few , large , curiously ribbed teeth , but on closer inspection these are seen to be composed of many , fine , slender individual teeth , like glass splinters . With all the fish grazers the price of such definite , abundant , non-motile food seems to be a stiffening of the whole body , activity being superfluous ; progression being by fins in place of any undulation , a rolling of the eyes in place of a twistable neck and body . But one does not need to go in enormous schools , hordes , or herds , such as surgeons , locusts , and antelope affect . The idols keep inpairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such unanimity that they might well be a single moorish idol and its shadow . They have an outrageous pout which reminds me of a lawyer friend , and which must be most useful in a Grazer , since one can graze and yet see upon what one is grazing without shoving back from the table . A word as to the parrot-mouths , which character indeed , has given their name to some of them . Here , as for example in the puffers , the teeth are wholly consolidated to form great cutting plates , usually divided in a harelip fashion into four . In other fish , as the stonewall perch , as the Japanese call it , the components of the beak are faintly visible , although solidly ossified , the tips showing as rounded , flat nodules . When I see what a considerable proportion of my subjects keep life within their bodies by scraping rocks and coral clear of the encrusting alge , worms , shells , crabs , and other growths and organisms , I marvel that the exposed surfaces are not all as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hasten renewed growth , and as there is never any trouble about irrigation , there is a never-ending supply . Again we must remember that , strictly speaking , all the fish of this group also belong to the tribe of Nomads , in the sense that their home is where they are and where food abounds . From my studies of the Grazers it seems to me that they must sleep in some manner inexplicable to us , confining to some one part of the brain the automatic , temporary regulation of eyes and fins . In an aquarium I have never been able to surprise one of the Grazers off guard . The one exception to all this is the trigger-fish , and these are chronic loungers and dozers . They lean over anything handy or slant back against a corner at night and are not easily disturbed , although the lidless , staring eyes are never veiled . As with any community , the more I studied my kingdom , the more complex became the various sects and guilds . I could keep on for many pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grazers , for turning to the great patches of sand without my mushroom city , I perceived castes of sand shovellers and sifters , to say nothing of sand waiters who disguised their deadly aggressiveness beneath a thin covering of this white dust ? dust which I could never think of as wet , because there was nothing dry for comparison . To the more gentle sand folk belonged the shovel-nosed rays , the mullets with their delicate chin feelers like the tapping stick of a blind man , and Polynemis of the long thread fingers , forever stretching out for knowledge of sustenance . These too , were sand colored , but probably rather as a protective cloak against the peering eyes of enemy Nomads . The great backbone of my population , the host of " common peepul " was what I called Percolators althoughsome of them were aristocrats and many did not percolate . As a whole , however , they lived their lives in and out of the coral and rocks , never becoming surface lovers , nor settling down in any special crevice . Still they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time I recognized the same individuals in the same coral palace grounds . In taste they were omnivorous or carnivorous , seldom wholly vegetarians and never strictly grazers . Like New Yorkers at lunch hour , they were victims of idle curiosity , and I shall never see a throng watching with breathless interest the overtime working excavators or the rhythmical riveters on some new building , without remembering the crowd of small Percolators who always rushed toward me when I first submerged , swimming rapidly with a My-Word ? -see-what's-here expression . My Percolators belonged to many families and systematic Bens , and their diversity of habits within the limits I have set would fill volumes . The most abundant was probably the beautiful blue-lined golden snapper , Eroplitesviridis , which I pictured in color two years ago in plate V in Galcipagos . This may be taken as typical of the group . In a dozen stomachs I found that crabs and very tiny fish each occurred five times , shrimp thrice , and snails once . They have little social instinct , and while a score or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they were never closely associated in schools . They ran or swam with many of the other medium and small Percolators , the most brilliant being wrasse , with unbelievably harsh and gorgeous pigments and patterns . Thallasoma , or the poussecaf ? fish , with its purple and yellow and green stripes , always formed a large percentage of the crowd of fish whirling about my hand and helmet when I held a bit of crab as lure . Dermatolepis , the big , high-backed , golden-spotted sea bass , must be considered as giant Percolators , for they were always trying to push through crevices and archways too small for them . They were ugly natured as well as bold , and needed only a little more courage to attempt to hamstring me when I was not looking . As they became angry or over-excited they showed their spleen or nervousness by changing color , thinking nothing of shifting from white to black , always with the yellow gold spangles shining clear . At the other end of percolate size were the tiny Runzdu , s , midget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers without my ever succeeding even in touching them . When I say that within a few minutes after taking my coral throne , I often had five hundred Percolators swimming close about me , the vast numbers of my subjects ( if not their loyalty other than gastronomic ) may be realized . Two more castes remain , the squatters and the villagers my favorites of all my fish . They were of greatest interest when compared with one another , for while the latter had individual crevice homes , yet they were built along normal fish lines , while the squatters , although they might spend only a short time in any given spot , were all physically adapted and modified for life in and over and around rocks and coral . The most abundant of the villagers were the brown Pomacentricls or demoiselles . They were everywhere and yet each one had its own little domicile ? a hole , or crack or crevice where it resided and which it defended against all corners . A sight of which I never wearied was to see a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barging slowly along , when suddenly out from the very coral rock in its path there would shoot a diminutive demoiselle , fins erect in righteous wrath , and actually rush at the offending giant . The gesture of home defense was so real that the attacked one if a small fish usually turned tail and fled at once , or , if the dignity of size had to be maintained , the surgeon or grouper would veer slightly to one side , as if recognizing and acknowledging the excellent motive of irritation , but saving their own face . All my life I have had a weakness for gobies and blennies and , now that I was able to sit upon a rock and have them come out like elves and gnomes and skip and slither about at my elbow , my fondness grew to real affection . Of all fish they give the impression of being less completely bound up in fishiness . I am sure that they would make splendid pets and would do all they could to cross the border line which divides the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lords ofcreation indeed ! who must needs breathe one thin medium , support ourselves upon a thicker one , and yet , although our body is seven-eighths of the third , perish miserably when immersed in it . I have given above a few , stray notes of a minute fraction of my shallow water kingdom , observed in a succession of fleeting moments of time . Its chief value is to show our ignorance of this cosmos ? and to stimulate at least my own desire to go and learn more . When I reached Cocos Island I had with me a list of thirty-eight species of shore fishes which had been collected twenty-six years ago . Of these I was able to secure and identify twenty-three , in addition to fifty-seven others which had never before been recorded from this lonely Island . During my stay therefore I observed eighty species , making a total of ninety-five altogether . I have notes on at least a third again as many which were too wary for me , although some of them would swim up to the very glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were quite new species . The details of this fauna , their names and relationships , colors and food belong elsewhere , but I desired here to give a shadowy hint of the mode of life and the personalities of a few , in the pitifully inadequate method of adulteration through the medium of human thought and words .
