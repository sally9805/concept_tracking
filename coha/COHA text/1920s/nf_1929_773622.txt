txt // I would suggest that the student first go through a thorough course of draftsmanship , learning the fundamental construction of every object thoroughly by applying a memory test to everything undertaken ? not for the instructor 's benefit , but for his own benefit , to be used later on where without material or data on hand his memory of objects and scenes has been so well trained that he can visualize and then construct . Under the title Drawing should come block construction , figure construction , anatomy construction , perspective , plus memory training . The student taking up illustration should have a course in the theory of advertising , from the experience and knowledge of a practical advertising agency . This naturally is an after training to a student who has learned his trade . The process of reproduction comes last , because he can adjust his mediums and designs , after learning them thoroughly , to mechanical processes . The most important training after the foregoing is to teach the student to think for himself , meaning ; thereby to originate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been produced in illustration , painting and advertising .

SCHOOLS OF APPLIED ART IN THE UNITED STATES A list of all schools of art in the United States , totaling 274 , is given in the American Art Annual for 1921 . Fifty-eight schools selected as representative of various types of work related to the field of the survey were studied through personal visits of representatives of the staff . Some thirty schools , noteworthy for their reputation and scope or for the special nature of the work presented , have been selected for brief descriptive notices . Collectively these schools represent by far the major part of serious instruction in applied art in the United States . It should not be assumed , however , that creditable work is not being done in institutions other than those described . In a number of schools outside of this group , thoroughly sound instruction leading to practical capacity in design is undoubtedly being given . No attempt to evaluate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such evaluation would not seem . to be needed for the purposes of this report and the Survey was not organized with the object of making authoritative judgments concerning the work of the schools . The schools in this group may be classified either as to the form of organization and support or by reference to the subjects taught . The Survey has adopted the first method as regards those schools affording instruction in a number of subjects , grouping special schools devoted to one particular branch under the subjects of instruction . The classification adopted , while not at once indicative of the quality of work represented , portrays more or less the scope and character of the different schools . For example , instruction in the college group as a rule has a distinctly cultural basis and comprehends but a small amount of work in applied design . The courses in art departments connected with art museums , with one notable exception , incline toward // the fine arts . With few exceptions work under state or municipal control , as far as day courses are concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mainly in the endowed schools and those conducted as private enterprises that practical specialization in applied art is to be found . A chart is also given analyzing the subjects of instruction as specified in the catalogues of the fifty-eight important schools . In considering the chart it should be borne in mind that the mere statement of a course in the catalogue has very little bearing upon its extent and character . For example , a school that may be doing very creditable work in applied design modestly notes a single course in this subject . Another school , of much smaller scope , may list its work in applied design under such headings as costume design , textile design , ceramic design , or jewelry design , indicating merely that a student is afforded an opportunity to specialize in one of these . Fourteen subjects are listed on the chart . One of these , applied design , is indefinite , but is a term made much use of in catalogues . The subjects , arranged in the order of the number of times scheduled are as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courses in applied art listed in school catalogues can be conSCHOOLS // sidered as offering practical and intensive instruction . Subjects like textile design , ceramic design , jewelry design and furniture design offered in many schools throughout the country apart from large centers of design or manufacture must obviously have little outcome other than handicraft design . The personal studies conducted by the Survey corroborate this statement and indicate that serious and thorough instruction in applied design which functions in the training of practical designers is afforded by very few schools in the United States .

The work of the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied art in clay , wood , or metal , or a combination of these materials , in which artistic quality and technical workmanship are given equal weight . Classes are organized in the following industrial art subjects . These are not necessarily separate classes , as often several groups work under the direction of one instructor . // Afternoon and evening classes ? designing , home decoration , modeling , mechanical perspective for students of illustration and interior decoration , portraiture , pottery . Evening classes ? pen drawing , poster classes , show-card writing , woodworking . There is craft work in connection with the study of design in modeling , pottery , home decoration , dressmaking and millinery and in wood and ironworking . There are forty-three instructors in industrial art subjects . Twenty-five of these maintain practical relations with the field in which they instruct . No trade committees are reported as cooperating with the school and no sales department is maintained . In 1921-22 there were 292 students in the industrial art classes of the day school , 887 in evening industrial art classes . and 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1921 to fifty graduates from industrial art courses . NEW YORK TEXTILE HIGH SCHOOL New York City Upon the recommendation of various organizations and establishments connected with the textile industry , the New York City Board of Education established in 1919 a Textile High School to meet the needs of this industry . It is a free school , supported by the City . Several cash scholarships or money prizes of from $15o to $20o are offered by manufacturers to worthy students in design . Boys and girls , sixteen years of age , who have completed satisfactorily the first two years of high-school and who have a knowledge of free-hand drawing are admitted to the regular courses of two years . Graduates of junior high-schools and pupils who have completed one year of high-school are eligible to enter the preparatory course of the school . The student is placed on probation for the first five months . There are two design courses ? Applied Textile Design and Costume Design . Other courses , in all of which there is some work in design , are as follows : General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineering ; Chemistry // and Dyeing . Certain academic subjects are required in. all of the courses . Pupils who pass the Regents ' examinations in these subjects receive , in addition to the regular school diploma , a Regents ' high-school diploma in academic and technical subjects . Costume Design Includes costume sketching , color harmony , costume design , draping , cutting , pattern cutting and grading , fashion illustration and instruction in dress materials . zipplied Textile Design ? Includes work in printed and woven textile design and the actual placing of these designs on fabrics . Affiliated with this school is an Evening Textile School for men and women engaged in the trade . The industrial art courses offered are ? Applied Textile Design and Costume Design . There are three teachers of applied art in the day school who give full time to this work . They have had practical experience in the field inwhich they instruct and do some freelance work at the present time . In the evening school there are five instructors in the design courses . These teachers have all had over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day in the industries in which they instruct . There is craft work in connection with the instruction in design . No products are sold through the school organization , but some are sold by individual students . There is very close cooperation between the school and the trade . Some of the organizations which act in an advisory capacity are the Waist League , Upholstery Association of America , the Silk Association , Sweater and Knit Goods Association , Clothiers ' Association , Cotton Converters Association , Finishers Association , Federation of Art Societies , Museum of French Art . In 1922 there were 730 students in the day school , distributed as follows : Applied Textile Design , 65 ; Costume Design , 175 ; General Textiles , 14o ; Marketing of Textiles , 225 ; Textile Manufacture and Engineering , 5o ; Chemistry and DyeSCHOOLS // ing , 75 . The school is too young to furnish data regarding the subsequent careers of graduates . OTHER TEXTILE SCHOOLS In addition to the New York Textile School and the textile departments of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a number of textile schools in which a limited amount of instruction in textile design is provided . Among these are the three state-supported schools in Massachusetts ? the Lowell Textile School , The Bradford Durfee Textile School at Fall River , and the New Bedford Textile School . These institutions give little attention to the artistic side of textile design but fabric design or the production of the various cloth weaves is studied thoroughly . Such schools train men mainly for positions on the mechanical side of textile production , and such graduates as take positions in the designing houses of the mills are called upon mainly to adapt designs sent in by converters and commission houses to the requirements of the looms . In only one school , the Bradford Durfee School , is instruction in this field carried far enough to equip a textile designer for any creative work . In this school the two years ' course in Designing and Weaving includes instruction in designing and cloth analysis , weaving and free-hand drawing . Instruction in free-hand drawing is mainly devoted to a study of ornament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIRLS New York City This school , supported by the City of New York and controlled by the Board of Education , aims to train girls who wish to prepare for entering the trades . No tuition fees are charged . Girls fifteen years old or over who are graduates of elementary schools are admitted . Girls who are not grad300 ART IN INDUSTRY uates of elementary schools , but who have completed the requirements for working papers , are admitted only when there are vacancies . The trades taught are : Dressmaking ; millinery ; making of flowers and feathers , lamp shades , novelties ; sample mounting ; operation of garment machine , straw-hat machine , embroidery machine ; manicuring and shampooing . The course leading to a diploma extends over two years . About one half of the instruction time is devoted to trade practice . Three hours a week are given to art instruction or industrial design . If an entering student shows any marked talent for drawing or designing , she is transferred to some other school where this work is given special attention . Onehalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as English , arithmetic , textiles , civics , industrial design , hygiene and physical training , and a certain amount of cooking and laundry work designed to make girls more useful in their homes . Diplomas are awarded in January to all girls who have completed the course and been placed in the trade for at least three months . There are about fifty full-time teachers who have had at least five years ' trade experience . The school maintains contact with the trade through its placement secretary , also through cooperation with individuals in various industries . There is craft work in all classes . An attractive salesroom with large display windows where the work of the students is sold is maintained by the school . A very limited amount of order work is also taken . The money derived from the sales covers the entire cost of materials , textbooks , office and academic supplies , but not the salaries of the teachers nor the maintenance of the building . There are from 1,000 to 1,200 students in the school constantly . From fifty to sixty per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses and are placed by the placement secretary . About forty per cent . of the girls take up dressmaking , fifteen per cent . millinery , twenty per cent . clothing operating trades , and twenty-five per cent . miscellaneous . SPECIAL SCHOOLS OR CLASSES MITCHELL DESIGNING SCHOOL New York City This school was established in 1873 . It is maintained by a private corporation affiliated with the Mitchell Publications , which include The American Ladies ' Tailor , The Sartorial Art Journal , and the American Furrier . The work of the school consists in teaching pattern drafting for men 's and women 's tailored garments . The course requires three months or a year , depending upon the ability and experienceof the student . Two-thirds of the time is given to pattern drafting and onethird to draping and grading . A valuable and comprehensive collection of fashion books and plates is at the disposition of students . Only persons in the tailoring trades are admitted . Enrollment is reported as between 200 and 300 students a year . The teachers are all practical men , having been trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to instruct . The students execute their work in paper and when sufficiently advanced make garments for their own use . It is stated that practically all graduates enter establishments as designers or cutters . AUTHENTIC STUDIOS BROWN 'S SALON STUDIOS FASHION ACADEMY McDOWELL DRESSMAKING AND MILLINERY SCHOOL New York City The above represent private institutions in New York City giving some or all of the following courses : Costume Design , Cutting , Fitting , Draping , Pattern Drafting , Costume Illustration , Dressmaking and Millinery. // Tuition fees which are generally charged for the special course , range from $30 to $225 a course . Some of the schools report enrollments ranging from 300 to 600 yearly . Designs and models are made and sold to the trade in each of the schools by instructors or students or both . A large percentage of the graduates are reported to obtain positions in the trade or to be engaged as free-lance designers . THE SCHOOL OF PRINTING AND GRAPHIC ARTS WENTWORTH INSTITUTE Boston , Mass . The School of Printing and Graphic Arts , opened in 1916 , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a board of directors . The principal of the Institute is the executive head . Each division of the School of Printing and Graphic Arts has its own department head . The tuition fees are thirty dollars a year for day classes and ten dollars for the evening classes . The day courses offered in Printing and Graphic Arts , are : first , one-year day courses of apprenticeship grade for persons who wish to become skilled workmen in composition , presswork , or photo-engraving ; and second , a two-year course in Printing and Graphic Arts for those who wish to train themselves for advanced positions in the printing or publishing industry , or for persons who wish to become superior and artistic compositors , layout men , or designers of fine printing . In addition to these full-time day courses , there are special part-time courses in etching , designing , hand engraving and color printing for artists and others . There are also part-time day courses for apprentices employed in printing shops in Boston and vicinity and evening courses intended for young men who are already employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stonework , presswork , English , proof-reading , applied mathematics , drafting , lettering , layout design , use of colors , applied science for printers and talks on processes and materials . // The one-year course in photo-engraving includes making of wet and dry negatives , printing on metal , etching , engraving , re-etching , proving , routing , blocking , English , applied mathematics , drafting and practical talks . The first year of the two-year course in Printing and Graphic Arts covers the ground of the one-year course in printing and in addition includes more advanced work in printing and applied art , history of printing , etc . In the second year there is a course in design and color work which deals with advanced instruction in layouts , study of type and original designs , and advanced study of color and color processes . There is also a course in photographic processes and one in advanced shop practice . Of the four instructors in shop practices all have had practical experience . Craft work is done in the making of books , folders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school has no sales department . A committee on apprentices from the Boston Typothetae and the United Typothetae of America cooperate in an advisory capacity . There is a similar relationship with the employing photo-engravers . In 1921-22 there were sixty-four day students in the printing course and 111 in the evening . Thirty-five received diplomas in the day course . OTHER PRINTING SCHOOLS Besides the printing departments at the Carnegie Institute and the Wentworth Institute previously described , trade instruction in printing is given at several schools in which a certain amount of attention to design is involved . Among these is the School of Printing maintained by the United ' Typothetae of America , at Indianapolis . This school is operated by the above-named employers ' organization and directed by a Committee on Education . The city of Indianapolis has furnished the buildings , and provides light , power and heat . The manufacturers have donated the machinery . // The aim of the school is to develop higher efficiency and better craftsmanship among journeymen and to train young men in mechanical processes , materials , office system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for executive positions . The tuition fee for the general course of eighty weeks is $300 . Certain elective courses in design are provided , the object of which is to develop a taste in the use of type and page arrangement . These courses are as follows : Principles of Design ? four weeks , four hours a week ; Color ? four weeks , five hours a week . There is also a course in Design Layout and Composing Room Management ? four weeks , 16o hours . This is a special course for the executive , salesman , office man and high-class compositor . The Ohio Mechanics Institute of Cincinnati maintains a Department of Lithography . A two-years course is provided , the object of which is to train lithographers . The course deals mainly with the technique of work on the stone . A certain amount of instruction in design is included in the course but not of sufficient amount to train artists . The tuition fee is Poo per year . A cooperative course is also maintained by the department in which the students study at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by twoweek intervals . This course consists of two years of work , twelve months per year . The student , while at work with the lithographic firm , is a regular employee and receives wages depending upon his ability . NEW YORK STATE SCHOOL OF CLAY WORKING AND CERAMICS AT ALFRED UNIVERSITY , Alfred , N. Y. This school , founded in 1900 for the purpose of training ceramic engineers and producers of high-grade ceramicwares , is a department of Alfred University . It is controlled by a Board of Managers which is appointed annually by the Trustees of the University . The school is in the immediate charge of a director . // Tuition is free to residents of New York State . In addition to laboratory , matriculation and miscellaneous fees and deposits , non-residents are charged a tuition fee of $35 per term , for the regular course of seventeen hours per week . Students taking more than seventeen hours are charged $3 for each additional hour , and those taking fewer than eight hours are charged $3 for each hour . Candidates for admission must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-school education . A four-year course in Applied Art leading to a degree is offered . This course includes instruction in drawing , modeling , design , ceramic craft , composition , English , modern language , chemistry , physical training , ethics and history of art . In the junior and senior years the student is allowed electives which may be utilized in the department of education and in further study in college subjects or in additional craft work . A course in " Textile Crafts " may be elected which comprises a comprehensive study of textiles . The work in the applied art courses is as follows : Modeling ? Production of pottery by hand building , wheel work ; plaster forms and molds , casting vase forms , tile making ; glaze preparation and use ; processes of pottery decoration , incising , embossing , slip treatment , inlaid glazes , kiln management and firing ; modeling for structural wares ; production of original work .

Composition ? Study of the laws of composition . The use of the figure in decorative modeling . Unusual decorative processes for pottery . Fourth year . Dour teachers give instruction in the industrial art courses . // All of these teachers are capable of doing commercial work , and they often sell pieces of their work through the Guild , an organization carried on by the institution for mutual benefit of students and faculty . There is craft work in connection with the study of design in all of the design subjects . Considerable of this work and some designs are sold through the Guild . Before articles are offered for sale they must be accepted by a jury which passes on all products . There is some cooperation with committees or individuals from the trades . None of the former graduates are reported as engaged in industrial design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are employed in studio work and others in free-lance designing . In 1921-22 there were twenty-seven students in the Applied Art Course . Diplomas were awarded to five graduates from this course in 1921 . Seventy-five per cent . of the students in the school take the Ceramic Engineering Course . SUMMARY As has been suggested before , it is clear that the American schools offering instruction in applied art that may be considered as broad , thorough and at the same time practical , are but few in number . Certain facts developed from the studies of the fifty-eight schools that were visited by staff representatives are of some significance in regard to the situation as a whole . In the first place , it is clear that there is little represented by the organization or methods of many schools that is calculated to bring a knowledge of the practical requirements of a definite field of design before the students . In a number of such schools the instructors in applied design have had no contact with commercial work through practical experience , nor , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commercial situation through the making of designs or illustrative material for trade purposes . FurtherSCHOOLS // more , comparatively few schools in the country have relations either with individual advisers or advisory committees from the trades . Competent knowledge of trade conditions may be brought to bear upon class instruction in one of several ways . It may be insured by the practical experience and trade contacts of the instructors or it may be insured through committees or individuals acting as advisers . But it is clear that in many schools of the country , work in applied design is being given not only by instructors who have had no practical experience and are maintaining no commercial contacts , but where there is no provision for gaining the practical point of view from committees or individuals . This is undoubtedly a weakness of our present situation and one that must be remedied if our schools are to perform their part in training workers to take practical part in American industries and assist in forwarding the standards of these industries . While this point can hardly receive too strong an emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this should not mean the subordination of breadth of culture to narrow trade instruction . Two problems face the schools of applied art : ( I ) to provide a sound and liberal art education , and ( 2 ) to bring that education into practical relation with commercial requirements . Both are equally essential if the schools are to do their share in the task of advancing the standards of American industrial art . Opinions given by school authorities as to the desirable length of day-school courses in the applied arts are as follows : of the schools under private auspices four mention two years and one , three years ; opinions expressed from the other schools vary from two to three years as the desirable extent of such courses , to four to five years . The largest number mention three years , three to four years , or four years . The large majority of school representatives recommend that a general course be given first which should include drawing , the principles of design and cultural subjects , to be followed by specialized work in some particular field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of bringing the student from the first into contact with the problems and material of the chosen field of design . In spite of this preponderance of opinion , it may be permissible to point out that there is much to be said as to the value of dealing from the first stages of art-school training with the material and aspects of the elected field of design as a means both of cultural and special instruction . Drawing and painting are , after all , but tools of workmanship ; composition and design for specific purposes are the ends to be sought . Every consideration in regard to holding and stimulating the interest of the workers would seem to incline toward the continuous use of material and principles related to the special fields of industrial art toward which the student is aiming . John Dewey has said that the way to prepare for life is through life itself , and his greatest contribution to educational thought is perhaps the principle that the mastery of the tools of communication can best be gained as an incident in dealing with situations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational practice has been based on the idea of acquiring certain skills through abstract drills with the idea that these will later be put into application . Today we are beginning to feel that for mere drill should be substituted activities that possess a meaning and a motive to the learner . The question seems worth raising whether a more serious consideration of this principle might not lead to greater vitalization of much of our art-school instruction in the fields of drawing and other subject matter commonly treated as mere preparation . Another consideration that arises from the school studies is the quality of the young people who enter the day art schools of the country . As a general rule the entrance requirements of such schools allow the enrollment of any applicant over the age of sixteen or seventeen who desires to study art . Rigid entrance examinations so often required in the case of the higher schools of applied art in Europe are missing . This situation , allows the admission of many students posSCHOOLS // sessing neither seriousness of purpose nor promise of talent . Under present conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance requirements of many schools of the country can be made more selective , but it can hardly be gainsaid that lack of strong quality in our art students constitutes a decided weakness in the present situation ? a weakness which it is to be hoped the strongest of our institutions will find themselves able to remedy gradually by raising their standards of admission . Such an increase in standards of admission , it is hardly necessary to say , should not be through the imposition of academic requirements , but through the development of methods which will assure a higher standard of artistic promise . The effect of a poor quality of student is not only felt in the earlier stages of art-school work but , inasmuch as many such remain in the school more as a matter of pastime than for hard work , they are often a drag throughout the entire course , particularly in the later stages . Since truly effective instruction in advanced classes must be largely an individual matter , small classes , unencumbered by weak and ill adapted material , are here an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools of art have been but little developed . A few schools , the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art , the Rhode Island School of Design , and the Maryland Institute , although organized on private foundations , receive money grants in the form of scholarships from the states - and cities in which they are located . In the case of the Pennsylvania Museum School , the amount contributed from each source is substantial , amounting to $56,250 from the state and $30,000 from the city . In only a few of the schools have scholarship provisions been made by the manufacturers . Among schools receiving such scholarships are the Rhode Island School of Design , Wentworth Institute of Boston , and the Mechanics Institute of Cincinnati . An important movement in this direction is represented by the activities of the School Art League of New York City . // The League provides a number of scholarships ( thirty-five during the year 1921-22 ) which are awarded to students in the high- schools of the city in order to allow them to continue their studies in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , the schools have reduced their tuition for these scholarship students , leaving only a fraction of the expense to be borne by the League . INDUSTRIAL ART EDUCATION IN EUROPE INSTRUCTION IN APPLIED ART IN ENGLAND At various periods during the last century English public opinion became conscious of the inferiority of native artistic goods when compared with continental products , and demanded that educational measures be developed to overcome the deficiency . In the early part of the last century the cry was first heard , and resulted in the establishment of schools of art , but it was not until 1835 that the first governmental inquiry into the condition of English manufactures was set on foot . In that year a committee was appointed " to inquire into the best means of extending a knowledge of the arts and of the principles of design among the people , ( especially the manufacturing population ) of the country ; and also to inquire into the constitution , management , and efforts of institutions connected with the arts . " The report of the committee resulted in the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Art ) , which has played a dominant role in art education in England . In 184o the government extended its assistance to the manufacturing districts , and authorized a grant of ? 10,000 towards the formation and outfit of schools of design in the large towns . In 1851 the International Exposition in Kensington brought home to the public in a larger way than ever before the artistic inferiority of English products . This led to the reorganization and considerable expansion of the School of Design . Another result was the introduction of craft work into this school and later into other schools . By the time of the Exhibition of 1862 a marked improvement was observed in the artistic industries . From this time until the present the efforts of those inter312 ART IN INDUSTRY ested in the furtherance of art education have been directed towards evolving an organization based upon central governmental control , the creation of an effective curriculum and a system of governmental pecuniary aid to art schools and classes . The report of the committee of 1835 suggested pecuniary aid be given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1851 in a system peculiar to English school administration and known as " grants in aid " which has had a marked influence upon art instruction in England . As originally instituted , it consisted in granting to each school or class giving instruction in the arts and sciences an amount of money based upon certain conditions . In general these conditions required that the school should meet certain requirements in equipment and enrollment , should not be conducted for private profit , must have an adequate and efficient teaching staff , that satisfactory progress must be shown by the pupils , and that the curriculum must be adapted to the conditions of the locality and must be approved by the national central body of control ? now the Board of Education . The Board has supervision of all school work in the kingdom . The more specific requirements were that the rates payable should be determined by the Board upon consideration of the subjects taught , the extent to which organized and continuous courses of instruction were effectively carried out , the qualifications of the teacher , and a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary rate of grant was 2s. 6d. to 3S. 6d. per pupil , which rate might be increased up to 15s. for special excellence . In administering this particular branch the Board of Education employs a staff of inspectors . These inspectors visit the classes annually , make note to the extent to which the requirements of the Board are being met and check up the attendance records . Formerly during a certain period of each year throughout the kingdom examinations were held in each class according to a syllabus sent out by the Board . // These examinations were conducted under conditions of strict local supervision and the exercises were sent to London to be rated and these ratings formed the chief basis upon which grants were made . In recent years a better method of estimating the amount of grants than that outlined above has been put into effect . An inclusive annual grant is now paid by the Board . It was first based upon the average amount of the grants received by the school for the last three years under the old method . The rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of annual and special " full " inspections . The assessment is based upon the work and attendance record of a class as a whole instead of upon the old examination basis of individual students . This system has completely supplanted the older method . The grants by Parliament of pecuniary aid to art instruction were first made with the hope that this would be a temporary measure and that the schools would become selfsupporting . This did not prove to be the case , and it is now felt that this is hardly desirable , as the schools would then be without government control . It is held that , while such control may at times be injudiciously directed , it at least gives a broader support to instruction which would otherwise be limited to local appreciation and even caprice . This policy of pecuniary aid has resulted in bringing art instruction to a large number of workers and craftsmen as well as amateurs in contradistinction to the policy of the continental art schools which seek to develop a select class of designers . Of the large numbers receiving art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent. ? are women amateurs . This large proportion is not considered a misdirection of effort inasmuch as such students may introduce a leaven of art appreciation in the purchasing public . An element of much importance in maintaining high standards in the schools of art and in keeping them in touch with the demands of industry is the inspection and report made to // the Board of Education upon each school , once in three or four years , by a group of inspectors . This group consists of several members of the regular Inspection Staff of the Board of Education , joined with persons prominent in the fine and applied arts . Reports made by these committees are very careful and comprehensive . They are critical and suggestive in nature and provide a valuable opportunity for bringing expert opinion of the highest order to bear upon the work of the schools . The formation of local advisory committees is encouraged by the Board and they are now very generally organized . Such committees inspect the work of the classes at frequent intervals during the year and confer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all elementary schools throughout England under the supervision of the Board of Education , which issues syllabi , thus tending towards uniformity of instruction throughout the kingdom . The motive is to teach children to see correctly , to draw carefully what they see , and to cultivate their sense of beauty . The time given to the subject is from one hour per week in the earlier grades to elective opportunities of three hours per week in the higher grades . No special equipment is provided except in the higher grades in the large cities , where special rooms are assigned . In the smaller schools the work is conducted by the regular class teacher or by a peripatetic teacher . In the larger cities special drawing teachers are employed . The work is now coordinated with handicrafts . Few textbooks are used , but the work is based upon a syllabus issued by the Board of Education or upon a syllabus prepared by the school authorities and approved by the Board . The 1918 Report of the Education Committee of London notes that " the work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symmetrical pencil drawings of former days . Drawing from the object with crayon and brush became universal , and was regarded by some as the only legitimate form of art instruction . This narrow view is gradually being discarded and a // wider and more varied art syllabus , including simple designs and the despised pencil work , is now being followed . " Drawing of plants and flowers and other objects of nature now enter largely into the work given in the elementary schools . The classes in day schools number more women than men , whereas in evening classes the greater number are young men . A considerable number of the art teachers of England receive their training at the Royal College of Art and are , therefore , well equipped with technical knowledge and artistic judgment . The fact that this college is largely recruited through scholarships tends to produce a body of students possessing art ability above the average . As the training given at the college is very thorough , there results an efficient body of teachers for supplying the needs of instruction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and courses pursued at the Royal College of Arts are given elsewhere in this report . The scheme of " art-pupil teachers " pursued in the schools of the country works to advantage in two ways : it gives the pupil a chance to develop his powers by practical experience and it also affords a supply of elementary art teachers to local schools . The art-pupil teacher is required to devote not more than one-third of his time to teaching and the remainder to his studies . One-half of his salary as a teacher is paid by the Hoard of Education and one-half by the local authority . Since the founding of the Royal College of Art industrial art training has been considered of increasing importance and the large number of art schools and classes , and schools of arts and crafts attest to the recognition of this practical need and indicate the importance of these institutions in supplying training to designers , craftsmen and teachers . The technical instructors in some of the schools are practical men recruited from the industries . The students are drawn from all the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their studies at ages varying from twelve to twenty-five years . In most schools no previous // preparation is demanded , but the pupil must possess a sufficient general knowledge to profit by the instruction given . The aim of most English arts and crafts schools , " to make the workman a better workman , " has been largely realized . There is still some tendency to consider the machine as an enemy to the production of anything beautiful , an attitude which is being combated by attempts to give the pupils a more complete knowledge of modern machine possibilities and requirements . In 1916 the Board of Education formulated and issued a special scheme to organize instruction in these matters . An estimate of the distribution of the graduates can hardly be made , as few of the schools keep records of the subsequent occupations of their graduates , though the practice of keeping such records is growing . Unquestionably the graduates of these schools form a large percentage of the designers in the industries . The arts and crafts movement as typified by the Arts and Crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of design of ordinary commercial goods . Its main result has been to stimulate a comparatively small group of men and women to produce " applied art , " such as stained-glass windows , work in silver , needlework , bookbinding and the like , but at this point the movement has apparently stopped . This , it may be noted , is in contrast with the history of such work in Germany , where through government encouragement and liberal expenditure of money , instruction in the arts and crafts is not only carried on very effectively in the schools but , what is more important , exerts a very large influence in the production of the factory and the workshop . As possibly indicative of the current trend in England , attention is called to the action of the municipal educational authorities of Leeds , who specifically require that all art education in the schools of the city must have for its purpose the advancement of the industrial arts . A considerable use is made of art material in museums . // These institutions are of a high standard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good collections to be found in many schools . The Board of Education has made a practice for many years of sending on loan from the Victoria and Albert Museum collections of examples to art classes which practice it is now extending to secondary schools throughout the kingdom . The methods employed in most applied-art schools are excellent and progressive and lead one to expect sound results from the pupils . London has a number of excellent applied-art schools , among which the Royal College of Art , the Central School of Arts and Crafts , and Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts rank first and exert a widespread influence . Some of the larger cities also conduct schools of marked excellence . All of these schools are finely equipped for their purpose , ably staffed , and well conducted . According to the Report of the Board of Education for 3919-2o , there were in England 183 schools of art , nineteen branch schools of art , and forty-six art classes working under the Bard 's regulations . Proposals for special courses in design applied to manufacturers are constantly being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer towards art training has generally been one of indifference and , at its rst , one of open hostility . There are , however , a number of - seeing manufacturers who are convinced of the practical value of industrial art education and who give whole-hearted port and cooperation . In a number of industries manufacturers have long seen the need for better art training of their young people and have developed relations with the schools r this purpose . At the outbreak of the war , plans were being formulated to remodel the scheme of arts-and-crafts education and place it upon a basis to meet more effectively the competition of continental methods , more especially those of Germany . The conviction had again taken hold that the position occupied by // England in certain crafts and manufactures was being successfully disputed by Germany . One result of this feeling was the formation , in 1915 , of the Design and Industries Association . This appears to be a serious attempt to enlist the cooperation of manufacturers , artists , designers , and art educators in placing English industrial art upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for improvement referred to above was interfered with by war conditions , but present indications are that earnest efforts are being made towards increasing the practical application and efficiency of industrial art education . The conditions surrounding the use of designs in industry are somewhat similar to those existing in the United States . A large number of designs , especially those for cotton prints , are imported from France . Some large firms have designing offices in Paris employing French designers . The proportion of free-lance designers to those employed steadily is approximately estimated at ten per cent . Free-lance designers , if at all successful , receive a high compensation for their labor . The local educational administrative authority in England is commonly invested in Education Committees which generally work through a number of sub-committees . The method followed by the County of London is that generally in use in other cities of the kingdom . The London County Council is the local authority responsible for promoting and coordinating all forms of education within the County of London . Practically the whole of elementary education in London is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher education the Council is associated with several other authorities , such as the University of London , the City Companies , the governing bodies of endowed secondary schools and the governing bodies of polytechnics and technical institutes . In the promotion of the different forms of education it is the object of the Council to work in cooperation with the other agencies that are engaged in educational work and to make sure that there is no overlapping or duplication of effort . The Council works // throughout in close association with the Board of Education , which is the central authority entrusted by Parliament with the duty of the supervision of education throughout the country . All matters relating to the exercise of the Council 's powers under the Education Acts , except the power of raising a rate or borrowing money , stand referred by statute to the Education Committee of the Council . A large share of the work of technical and art instruction is carried on in polytechnic and technical institutes , which may be divided into three classes : ( 1 ) Those aided by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London County Council . ( 3 ) Those receiving no aid from the London County Council . The institutions vary greatly in size . Thus , the Regent Street Polytechnic in normal times has over 12,000 students and receives a maintenance grant from the Council amounting to ? 14,200 a year , while one or two of the institutions have less than one hundred students and receive correspondingly smaller grants from the Council . The institutions aided by the Council receive from it building , equipment and maintenance grants . Apart from the financial assistance given by the Council , their income is made up of Board of Education grants , endowments , grants from the City Parochial Foundation , students ' fees , and voluntary subscriptions . Each institution has a governing body or committee on which the Council is represented . The institutions maintained by the Council are eighteen in number . The following institutions which afford instruction in applied art are among these : The Central School of Arts and Crafts and the Camberwell School of Arts and rafts , which provide instruction in a great variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with engineering subjects and has also an art school , and other departments ; the Shoreditch Technical Institute , which provides chiefly for the furniture trades ; and the School of Photo320 ART IN INDUSTRY Engraving and Lithography ( Bolt Court , Fleet Street ) , for the photo-process and allied trades . The Council is assisted in the management of its schools by Advisory Sub-Committees and Consultative Committees . The Trade Consultative Committees advise the Council in connection with the detailed administration of the work of instruction as related to the respective industries . The Advisory Sub-Committees are local , and each is attached to some particular institute maintained by the Council . As regards the Consultative Committees , some are attached to particular institutions ; in addition to these there are Central Consultative Committees for Engineering , Chemistry , and Banking and for the Book-production Trades ( including the Bookbinding Trades and the Printing and Allied Trades ) , the Goldsmiths ' , Silversmiths ' , Jewellers ' and Allied Trades , the Furnishing Trades and Men 's Tailoring Trades . Each Central Consultative Committee consists of three groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Associations of Employers , and the corresponding trade unions or federations of allied unions . The great majority of the students who are in attendance at the various technical institutions are evening students who are engaged in commercial or industrial pursuits in the daytime . The evening trade classes which constitute the bulk of the evening work , are , as a rule , confined to bona fide workers in the respective trades . The fees charged for admission to evening classes in these institutions are as follows : Persons employed in trades or occupations upon which the teaching of the school has a distinct bearing are admitted to all or any of the classes of the school which they are eligible to join , on payment of fees at the following rates ? if earning over 30s. a week , 10s. the session ; if earning 30s. or less a week , 4s. 6d. the session . Persons not employed in trades or occupations upon which the teaching of the school has a distinct bearing may be admitted to the school on payment of 10s. 6d. a term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of sixteen , if // qualified for admission to the School and furnishing satisfactory evidence that their work is of sufficient merit , may be admitted on payment of 4S. 6d. for the session . In the evening school one fee admits to all the classes which the student is permitted to join . Persons under twenty-one years of age qualified for admission to the institutes and bona fide engaged in the trade are admitted free on production of certificates from their employers , or on showing copies of indentures . The day work carried on in technical institutions covers a wide field and includes courses for students working for universitydegrees and other advanced courses as well as art classes for training designers , teachers and skilled craftsmen . Several of these institutions also contain junior technical day schools or trade schools which provide a pre-apprenticeship training for boys and girls . In order to assist boys and girls from the elementary schools to proceed to these schools , the Council has established a certain number of trade scholarships , which provide free education together with maintenance grants . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principals and other teachers in technical institutes . The scale for principals is divided into groups , the minimum salary in the lowest group being ? 400 and the maximum in the highest group being ? 1,200 . The salaries for heads of departments range from ? 400 to ? 800 in the case of men , and from ? 300 to ? 600 in the case of women . The salaries of whole-time lecturers and teachers range from ? 15o to ? 45o in the case of men , and from ? 120 to ? 30o in the case of women . At the same time a revised scale of salaries for principals , responsible masters and mistresses , and other teachers in evening institutes , was put into effect . The salaries of principals and whole-time responsible masters range from ? 350 to ? 600 , and of whole-time responsible mistresses from ? 300 to ? 400 . The payments to lecturers and instructors range from 10s. an evening to ? 1 is. an evening , while special payments of a higher amount are made in special cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1836 the House of Commons appointed a select Committee on Arts and Manufacture to inquire into the best means of extending a knowledge of the arts and of the principles of design among the people ( especially the manufacturing population of the country ) , also to inquire into the constitutional management and effects of institutions connected with the arts . The Committee reported that the arts had received little encouragement in England . As a result of this report a School of Design was opened at Somerset House on June 1st , 1837 . In 1849 a select committee produced a report wherein they described the maintenance of the School of Design to be an object of national significance and urged the importance of selecting men practically acquainted with designing for instructors , admitting at the same time the failure of the present school of arts to produce any effect upon the manufacturers . In 1851 the first exhibition of pupils ' work was held . In 1852 , as a result of the condition of British industrial art revealed by the International Exposition of 1851 , the school was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general and elementary instruction in art as a branch of national education among all classes , to improve the art judgment in producer and consumer . Second , to advance instruction in art . Third , the application of art to the improvement of manufacture and the establishment of museums . In 1857 the school was transferred to South Kensington and the South Kensington Museum was opened . The nucleus of its enormous collection consisted of the art objects exhibited at the great exhibition of 1851 . The art school was lodged in the rear of the building . In 1859 the school is described as having as its primary purpose the supply of art teachers for all schools in the country . In 1836 National Scholarships for Industrial Students // were established and the school changed its name to The National Art Training School , and in 1897 the name was again changed to The Royal College of Art . In the year 1900 a scheme was drawn up for the reorganization of the school which embodied the following features : The appointment of a Council of Art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , direct promotion of the study of design . At this time the work of the college was reorganized on the basis of four schools , each under its own professor , dealing respectively with architecture , painting , ornament and design , sculpture and modeling . The policy of encouraging technical work in the so-called craft classes as an essential part of the curriculum , especially for students of design , was also laid down at this time . The Royal College of Art is supported by the state . and administered by the Board of Education , which consists of the President , Permanent Secretary , Parliamentary Secretary , Assistant Secretary , Chief Woman Inspector , and a Committee of Visitors of four . The Committee of Visitors consists of representatives of both artists and manufacturers who exert a slight influence on the character of the various courses . The College is well equipped with classrooms , lecture halls and workshops , and has at its disposal the collections of the South Kensington Museum , which are almost unlimited in their wealth of material , and of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for industrial designers . The teaching staff consists of a principal , a headmaster , five professors , three instructors , two assistant instructors , two assistants , seven teachers , two assistant teachers , one demonstrator , one lecturer . The director is appointed by the Board of Education . The teaching staff is selected by the Committee of Four and the director , and is appointed by the Board of Education . The selection is largely from graduates of the college and they are generally full-time teachers . The salaries range from ? 400 to ? 1,25o per year . The teachers of design are experienced persons possessing // a knowledge of the technical requirements of the craft for which they instruct . Studios are provided for professors and teachers to enable them to continue the practice of their profession and craft . The number of students is at present between Zoo and 25o . About one-half of these come from London or from the urban districts of three large industrial counties , namely , Yorkshire , Lancashire and Staffordshire ; the rest come in small numbers from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British Dominion . From time to time a foreign student is admitted . The age range of the students on admission is a wide one , extending from fifteen to over forty years . Aspirants are required to submit their work according to the branch of instruction they desire to enter . Fees are ? 25 for the complete session and ? I2 Ios. for one term . External students in the craft classes pay ? 2 2s. per term . Fee-paying students who show themselves possessed of more than ordinary ability are recommended by the principal for free tuition . One of the most significant facts in connection with the college is that the student body is largely recruited through scholarships . Six National Scholarships of ? 90 each , paid by the government , are awarded to persons in the industries who make the best showing in examinations held in the art schools throughout the country in May and June each year . These scholarships are given for three years and may be extended to four or five years according to the progress of the scholar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year for a period of three years , are awarded by the Board of Education and are open to all students irrespective of their calling . These scholarships are competed for at the Board 's examinations , held annually in all the art schools . Fifteen free scholarships are also awarded annually by the Board of Education to candidates who compete for the above scholarships and whose performance is creditable but not up to the standard required for the National Scholarships and Royal Exhibitions . Another form of scholarships receives the term Local ExhiINDUSTRIAL // bitions . In case a local authority contributes half the value of the scholarships of ? 90 per annum for three years , the Board of Education agrees to contribute the remainder . These scholarships are also competed for at the Board examination held in the art schools annually throughout the kingdom . There are also upwards of sixty County Council Scholarships awarded to students in the different art schools of the kingdom by County Councils . These scholarships are often given to persons who have been attending evening schools or Saturday afternoon classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years which may be extended to four . Finally , there are a number of Royal College of Art Scholarships of ? 90 each awarded for one or two years . These scholarships are open to students already in the college who have attended for a period of not less than two years . They are usually awarded to students who have entered the college upon one of the above-named scholarships , the tenure of which has expired , to enable them to remain at the college for a fourth or fifth year . These scholarships exercise a strong selective influence in the matter of admission to the Royal College of Art . They operate to bring advanced training in applied art to specially able young persons throughout the kingdom . Each professor in the four courses of architecture , painting , engraving , sculpture and design , in conjunction with the principal , prepares a syllabus of instruction for his school covering a period of three years . As a rule students studying beyond that time are specialists and for them post-graduate study is arranged . Courses planned for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely works out his own course . He makes his own design in the school and then executes the object from the design , guided by the craft instructor . Lectures are given in each school by the professor as the class work demands . No lectures are given apart from the class work . The aim of the instruction in the school of design is to give to those who intend to become designers or workers in the // field of industrial art a sound practical and artistic education making toward adaptability and readiness of expression . The attitude of the school is that creative power is not such a rare gift as is imagined , but like all gifts requires an environment which will give it an opportunity of development , and which will aid selection , refinement and appreciation of beauty of both form and color . The plan of work in the school of design is as follows : Lower Division ? The outstanding feature of the course ( apart from original design ) is the importance given to the study of plant form , natural history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these studies are careful and exact representations of the originals , and no conventional treatment is allowed in working from nature . Upper Division ? Students as a rule are promoted to this division at the end of the first half-year . In this division instruction is concentrated largely upon the work of applied design . Craft Classes These classes provide an opportunity for students to become acquainted with the limitations of the materials for which they have made designs . The following crafts are represented : wood engraving ; embroidery and tapestry weaving ; wood carving , furniture making and gesso work ; lettering and illumination ; gold and silversmithing , jewelry and enameling ; stained glass ; stone and marble carving ; weaving ; lithography ; mosaic work . No craft work or designs made in the school are sold by the school . About seventy-five per cent . of the students entering remain throughout the whole course . The larger percentage of the graduates become teachers of art . It is reported that about fifteen per cent . go into the designing rooms of the industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal-work and jewelry designers . Such graduates start with salaries of from ? 30 to ? 70 per month . Certain strictures upon the work of the College are contained in a report of a special committee made to the Board of Education in 1912 . In this report it was pointed out that // two very clear and distinct functions are imposed upon the College : " It has to be the training ground whence a supply of teachers is regularly drawn for the local schools of art , and it has at the same time to give specific training to the pick of the industrial students of art from the local schools who desire to win for themselves commanding positions either as handicraftsmen in the more limited sense of the term , or as designers for the manufacturing industries . " The report goes on to state that up to 1912 the trainingschool aspect of the College was as the whole the predominant one . Most of the students who went through the shorter course expected to become teachers . A table in the appendix giving the occupations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a very large proportion were engaged in teaching . The work in applied design is given considerable attention in the report . It is held that " the most serious criticism is no doubt that , in spite of the experience in arranging for real work ' which the craft classes afford , much of the inventive design remains unpractical , and may be described as design in the abstract rather than design for some actual and clearly understood technical process . " The committee state that they are disposed to think that it was designers for the handicrafts who derived the greatest benefit from the College of Art course as then organized . As far as training of designers for the industries is concerned , the committee found that the graduates of the College of Art were not held in high regard by employers . In order to train designers for the industries effectively the committee reached the conclusion that this object could only be accomplished by the adoption of a method of training which will maintain throughout a very close connection between each student and the specific industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one uniform system of art training will Serve the needs of all industries ; each industry must be studied as a separate problem . . . I f the training of designers is to be kept in close relation to the industries , it must in the main be // carried on in the actual centers where those industries are located , and where alone the necessary equipment can without unreasonable expense be made available . " The recommendations of the committee make for decentralization of the work of the College of Art together with greater assumption of the function of training designers for the industries by the provincial colleges of art situated in centers of local industries . The first recommendation in full is as follows : " That the training of designers for the manufacturing industries should be specialized , and should be undertaken by provincial colleges of art , each of which , while continuing to provide a general education in art , should devote special attention to the needs of the dominant industry in its locality , and to this end should take steps to associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . " Since the issuance of this report it is evident that greater efforts have been made to develop industrial designers in the College and that the proportion of such designers entering the industries has been considerably increased . CENTRAL SCHOOL OF ARTS AND CRAFTS London This school and the three other London schools covered in this report are administered by advisory sub-committees . of the Education Committee of the London County Council . The Central School of Arts and Crafts was established by the London County Council in 1896 with the object of helping British handicrafts and industries by maintaining their ancient traditions while furthering their modern development in design and workmanship . The school was founded solely for the training of arts and crafts workers and aims to supplement rather than to supersede apprenticeship by affording those engaged in art industries opportunities for design and practice in the branches of the craft which , owing to the subdivision of productive processes , they are unable to learn in the workshop . The attainINDUSTRIAL // ment of the full purpose of the school is somewhat retarded 1 ) y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprentice who is learning his trade and has little or no knowledge of art to the highly skilled worker , professional artist and advanced student of design . There seems little doubt that the school is at present heavily weighted with students who are comparative beginners . In May , 1919 , the Council decided that it should be a central school in the highest sense and provided with facilities for doing the most advanced work in the following departments or schools : Silversmiths ' Work and allied crafts , Textiles , Stained Glass and Mosaic , Painted and Sculptured Architectural Decoration , Book Production , Furniture , Dress Design , Engraving . In addition to these subjects of special study there is provided ancillary instruction in architecture and building crafts , drawing and painting . The length of the courses varies from two to five years . The curriculum makes provision for full and part-time day students who are studying with a view to gaining a livelihood by some form of applied art work , for apprentices in art crafts and industries by means of early evening classes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits of their attendance only in the evening for further study to make them more proficient as designers or executive craftsmen . The main work of the school is carried on in its evening classes in which 1,729 students were enrolled in the year 1919-20 The schools of instruction represented in the evening courses are as follows : School of Architecture and Building Crafts , which aims to meet the needs of architects ' pupils and assistants as well as of craftsmen and students of other subjccts in which a knowledge of architecture is essential ; School of Painted and Sculptured Architectural Decoration and Stained Giass , the object of which is to encourage understanding and practice of all forms of decoration associated both internally and externally with building ; School of Furniture , // the purpose of which is to give a right understanding of the craft of furniture making and designing and to maintain the English tradition ; School of Design , Textiles and Costume , which deals with all forms of surface design for furnishing and dress materials , and their uses in decoration and costume ; School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book production , the object of which is twofold ? first , to preserve and encourage skill and appreciation of fine bookwork and the closely allied arts of engraving and lithography , and second , to strive for the artistic enhancement of the many commercial uses of these crafts which arise continually . Lectures on a wide range of art topics were given during the year 1920-21 . The school occupies a splendid building centrally located in London and is extremely well equipped with classrooms , lecture halls , library and modern workshops . The local industries upon which the school has a bearing are mainly those comprised under the term art handicrafts , which include silversmithing and goldsmiths ' work , diamond mounting , gem setting , and the various allied metal work trades . Besides the evening work the Junior Technical School provides full-time courses of instruction in the printing and bookbinding trades and the silversmithing and ancillary trades . Day Technical School for Boys in Book Production This school was established by the Council for the purpose of educating boys by means of printing , bookbinding and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and Jewelers ' Work . The object of this school is to enable boys who intend to enter some branch of the silversmiths ' or kindred crafts , as silversmiths , goldsmiths , jewelers , chasers , engravers , piercers carvers , mounters or draftsmen , to continue their general education and at the same time to acquire such a knowledge // of the artistic principles of design and of the scientific principles of construction , of the properties of materials and of the use of tools as will enable them at the end of the course to enter a workshop with an intelligence so trained as to make them immediately of value to an employer . In each of these departments the boys remain in the school until they are sixteen years of age , when they are apprenticed to some firm of recognized standing , the time spent in the school being counted as two years of their period of apprenticeship . Each school is open to receive a limited number of boys , between thirteen and fourteen years of age , who are in good health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the trade . There are Consultative Committees from the different trades , connected with the various courses offered by the school . Types of such committees are Bookbinding Section : Representatives of the London Bookbinders ' Association , of the Workman 's Association , and of the Council ; Printing Section : Representatives of the Association of Master Printers , of the Federation of Printing and Allied Trades , and of the Council . The staff consists of seven regular teachers , sixty-four visiting teachers and four lecturers . Only one of the regular teachers is in full-time employment at the Central School of Arts and Crafts ; the others are partly employed in other schools in the same building or elsewhere . The visiting staff is composed entirely of professional artists or art craftsmen who practice and are expert in the various branches of art or handicraft which they are employed to teach , and some of them are eminent exponents of their respective subjects . Several of these teachers have been employed in the school since its establishment in 1896 . The time of employment of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it being determined to a great extent by the demand for the particular subject or subjects they teach . In this , in common with other schools under // the Local Education Authority , the extensive employment of part-time teachers is primarily intended to secure the services of practical professional or industrial workers . The salaries of the headmasters range from ? 457 to ? 650 per year , and the salaries of the instructors from ? 275 to ? 375 per year . Through training and experience the teachers of design are well versed in the technical requirements of their crafts . With the exception of the technical instructors in the evening classes , such teachers do not as a rule engage in commercial work . In 1919-20 there were 305 day students , 268 day-andevening students and 1,463 evening students . Of the total of 2,036 students 1,293 were males . About seventy-five per cent . of the students entering remain throughout the whole course . By far the larger percentage of the graduates enter the workshops of the industries . About twenty per cent . go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ? 30 to ? 45 per month . From information furnished by the various teachers , it is evident that the school is doing most useful work in training students for the various artistic industries included in the curriculum , and in the provision of facilities for more advanced study for those already engaged in such industries . Many of the students in modeling , etching , illustration and miniature painting are working as professional artists , either independently or in connection with some firm . There is very considerable cooperation with employers , especially in those industries which predominate in the neighborhood of the school , such as silversmithing and the allied trades , bookbinding and printing . This cooperation is manifest in connection with the attendance of apprentices at the special early-evening classes which meet twice a week for each section from 4:45 to 6:45 , arranged for them in the employers ' time , and also in the selection and placing of suitable students as employees with firms engaged in the above-mentioned industries . During recent years several important firms engaged in the // drapery and furnishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special day classes for their employees . The scheme has been developed gradually by experiment and experience at this school , and as it is now regarded as being on a sound basis , the classes are to be decentralized and in the future they will be held in four convenient centers , three on the north and one on the south side of the river . As far as the preparation for design goes , the Central School of Arts and Crafts is the most favorably viewed of all London schools by the manufacturers . Hundreds of London firms are in close association with the Council , offering , in some cases , premises for school work and other facilities and giving all encouragement to their young workers . There is also a certain amount of cooperation with the trade unions . Experiments are being made with classes for manufacturers and buyers , ( luring business hours . CAMBERWELL SCHOOL OF ARTS AND CRAFTS London The school was founded in 1898 with the purpose of providing instruction in those branches of design which bear on the more artistic crafts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The school occupies a substantial building , well equipped with class and lecture rooms , library and work shops . Day classes are conducted from 10 to 1 and from 2 to 4 ; late afternoon classes for apprentices and learners from 4:15 to 7:30 and evening classes from 7 to 9:30 . The following subjects are given both day and evening : book illustration , figure composition and commercial design ; drawing and painting from life ; figure and costume ; still life painting ; fashion drawing ; lettering and illuminating ; drawing and design for costume making and decorative design ; dressmaking ; decorative design and drawing ; embroidery ; metalwork ; bookbinding ; modeling . The following subjects are given in the evening only : Painted lettering , inscription design and ticket writing ; his334 ART IN INDUSTRY tory of decoration ; lithographic drawing and design ; typography for compositors ; modeling for carvers and plasterers ; wood and stone carving and letter cutting ; furniture design and drawing ; plasterers ' work , plain and decorative ; stained glass work and drapery drawing ; classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . There are also evening classes in anatomy , preliminary figure and unclassified drawing , architecture , history of architecture , building construction , house painting and decorating and a class for machine minders . In the following subjects there are evening classes as well as late afternoon classes for apprentices and learners : Pottery , geometrical drawing and perspective , and cabinet-making . Afternoon classes for composing and machine apprentices in the printing trades are held as follows : Composing ? Monday and Tuesday , 2:30 to 6 ; Wednesday and Thursday , 4:45 to 7:15 ; Machine ? Monday 2:30 to 6 . These classes are for young workers bona fide engaged in the trade only , and the curriculum embraces the theoretical and practical sides of the subject , together with lessons in English and in the history of the craft . Employers are asked to look upon these classes as supplementary to the shop and they are invited to give their apprentices facilities for attending them . Attendance reports are made monthly to employers of students , and progress is reported every three months . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume making and decorative design and the class in furniture design and drawing are given below : Drawing and Design for Costume Making and Decorative Design ? The work of this class embraces the following syllabus which is arranged to cover a two years ' course : ( I ) The study of historic costume ; ( 2 ) the cutting out , modeling and draping of characteristic styles of various periods , the knowledge so acquired being directed to the designing of modern costume ; ( 3 ) the study of dress decoration and the production of designs for embroidery , braiding , beading , etc. ; ( 4 ) fashion sketching for dressmakers and others . // Furniture Design and Drawing ? This class provides instruction in the principles of design as applied to furniture and interior woodwork . Designs are worked out to scale with full-size details of moldings and ornaments . Instruction is also given in setting out perspective drawings of furniture and interiors , and in the application of carving , inlaying , painting and metal work to the decoration of furniture , etc . A three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond this period further instruction is provided in other features of work essential to this subject . During the session certain of the classes visit , under the guidance of their respective teachers , the Victoria and Albert Museum , the British Museum , the National Gallery , the Zoological Gardens , the Natural History Museum and other places of interest . In the summer months arrangements are made for certain classes to sketchinoneof the Council 's parks , thus affording opportunity for outdoor sketching . The session comprises two terms , extending from the last week in September to January 31st , and from February 1st to the last week in June . In 1921-22 there were 322 day pupils and 1,055 evening pupils in the various courses . SHOREDITCH TECHNICAL INSTITUTE London " ' his school is situated in the heart of the furniture manufacturing district of London and deals with instruction in all branches of the furniture trade . It also conducts a trade school for girls , and a teachers ' training department . The day department embraces all three of these divisions but by far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the evening classes connected with cabinet-making and the allied trades . The aim of the evening classes for men is to help establish and maintain a high standard of skill in cabinet-making , woodworking , and allied trades ; to afford artisans the advantages of broadening their knowledge ; to enable young craftsmen to
