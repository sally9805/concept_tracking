txt No greater mistake can be made than to estimate the strength of the various Republican Presidential candidates by the number of delegates they have pledged or can get pledged . The nomination is going lb be made by the uninstructed delegates . It takes 493 votes to nominate the candidate and the uninstructed delegates already number 409 , which is between three and four times as many as those instructed for any candidate . The campaign to elect uninstructed delegates is so far from having reached its maximum . that of the 185 delegates still to be chosen it is morally . certain that a large majority will be in that class . On its face this appears to be a victory for the Old Guard . As far back as last Winter it was agreed among leading organization Republicans in Washington that this policy should be followed , and in most of the States the machine has worked for Uninstructed delegates . The curious combination between Senator LODGE and ex-Senator CRANE in Massachusetts worked successfully to that end . The same is true of the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name the district delegates without instructions . It is what the machine men in that . State have been hoping for from the first and is the real reason why they encouraged the Johnson movement at the first , hoping to prevent WOOD from getting a majority , which would have been an instruction in itself . They came near overplaying their hand , not having counted on the possibility of . JoHrisox getting a. big - enough vote to give hiin:a , , but they woke up ' at the last- moment and saved themselves . Wow 's plurality , under the Indiana law , does ' not entitle him to any more delegates than the organization is willing to give him , and that will probably be not more than one-third of the delegation on the first ballot . After that the organization will come pretty near being able to direct where the Wood , votes shall go . The Wood and Johnson men have been working for instructions . The Lowden men are ' not , except in form . They make just enough : of a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aiming at is the uninstructed body . In a measure that was true of HARDING , but HARDING was obliged to make a fight for instructions in his own State and the neighboring one of Indiana to preserve appearances And for the moral ' effect , and the result in both has been disastrous to him . It has left LOWDE ? N. stronger in his chosen position as a second choice candidate . There are many States in which the delegates prefer to have no instructions , without regard to whether the Old Guard favors the idea or not , so that they can be free to choose for themselves . There is a strong sentiment among the rank and file politicians in favor of being able to pick out the candidate who shows the most power to grow in strength after . the first few ballots . The fight , therefore , is still any man 's fight . The fact that WOOD leads in the , number of instructed delegates is not conclusive . The question is how much strength he has among the , uninstructed.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
