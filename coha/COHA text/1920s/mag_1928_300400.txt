ELIZABETH AND ESSEX , A Tragic History-Lytton Strachey-Harcourt Brace <P> ( $3.75 ) . <P> The Portrait Gallery . Elizabeth . <P> " Only a woman could have shuffled so shamelessly , only a woman could have abandoned with such unscrupulous completeness the last shreds not only of consistency , but of dignity , honor and common decency , in order to escape the appalling necessity of having , really and truly , to make up her mind . Yet it is true that . . . male courage , male energy . . . she also possessed . . . . <P> " She was mistress of six languages besides her own , a student of Greek , a superb calligraphist , an excellent musician . She was a connoisseur of painting and poetry . She danced , after the Florentine style , with a high magnificence that astonished beholders . Her conversation , full , not only of humor , but of elegance and wit , revealed an unerring social sense , a charming delicacy of personal perception . It was this spiritual versatility which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <P> " In spite of superficial resemblances , she was the very opposite of her most dangerous enemy-the weaving spider of the Escurial . Both were masters of dissimulation and lovers of delay ; but the leaden foot of Philip was the symptom of a dying organism , while Elizabeth temporized for the contrary reason-because vitality can afford to wait . The fierce old hen sat still , brooding over the English nation , whose pullulating energies were coming swiftly to ripeness and unity under her wings . She sat still ; but every feather bristled ; she was tremendously alive . . . . " <P> Essex . " Leicester . . . appointed him General of the Horse . The post was less responsible than picturesque , and Essex performed its functions perfectly . . . . <P> " His spirit , wayward , melancholy , and splendid , belonged to the Renaissance-the English Renaissance , in which the conflicting currents of ambition , learning , religion , and lasciviousness were so subtly intervolved . . . . <P> " He turned aside suddenly from the exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inner room , the sensuous harmonies of Spenser . He dallied dangerously with court beauties ; and then went to meditate for hours upon the attributes of the Deity in the cold church of St. Paul . . . . " <P> Francis Bacon . " He was no striped frieze ; he was shot silk . The detachment of speculation , the intensity of personal pride , the uneasiness of nervous sensibility , the urgency of ambition , the opulence of superb taste-these qualities , blending , twisting , flashing together , gave to his secret spirit the subtle and glittering superficies of a serpent . . . . The music sounds , and the great snake rises , and spreads its hood , and leans and hearkens , swaying in ecstasy ; and even so the Lord Chancellor , in the midst of some great sentence , some high intellectual confection , seems to hold his breath in a rich beatitude , fascinated by the deliciousness of sheer style . . . .
