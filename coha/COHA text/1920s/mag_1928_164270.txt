An astute group of malefactors have recently been circulating pirated editions of the London Telephone Directory . Shrewd , they have reaped pelf from advertising sales . Last week , however , they were ordered by a London court to pay damages ot 300 ( $1,458 ) to him who owns the copyrights of all British telephone directories , namely the King-Emperor . <P> Persons who wondered how George V has managed to acquire so unique a monopoly wondered no longer when they reflected that British telephones are owned and operated by His Majesty 's Post Office . <P> <P> The Admiralty 's estimate of its budgetary needs was presented to the House of Commons , last week , by rubicund First Lord of the Admiralty William Clive Bridgeman . After tolling out the mighty total sum of 57,300,000 ( $278,478,000 ) , Mr. Bridgeman remarked that this represents a cut of 700,000 from the appropriations of last year . <P> Referring pointedly to the U. S. Naval program ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) , he piously declared : " Nothing ... is going to drive us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . " <P> But British naval supremacy will continue amply maintained under the present estimates .
