The Secretary of Commerce , short and rotund and intent on business , appeared last week again before the House Committee on Commerce , which he recently provoked into an investigation of foreign price-control of rubber , coffee and other products . He declared that since the committee began investigation prices had fallen from $1.10 a pound to 85 ( and even lower ) on rubber ; that users had already planned two corporations to seek relief - one with a capital of $10,000,000 , the other with a capital of $50,000,000 . He repeated that he did not favor reprisals , but declared that if prices continued upward , reprisals might be demanded by public opinion , and the Administration was foreign monopolies in raw materials . He specifically suggested that the Federal Trade Commission be given permanent authority to collect data on the profits on foreign raw products in which there are monopolies in order to keep the country posted . discouraging loans by bankers to The British side of the picture was explained by Sir Esme Howard* the British Ambassador , at a luncheon given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said : " I refer to that most useful material known as rubber , especially provided , one would suppose , by nature to ward off inconvenient and unpleasant shocks , but which latterly seems to have lost this pleasant quality , and to be charged with an all too electric-shock creating power . " <P> He went on to describe his own attempt at rubber growing many years ago : " I traveled for two years at my own expense , in the Amazons and in Mexico and the West Indies , accompanied by a botanist who has since risen to eminence in the University of Cambridge . Well , in spite of that , to make a long story short , we planted the wrong kind of rubber tree in the West Indies , and after waiting for over ten years to see if the tree we planted , the Castilloa Elastica of Mexico and Central America , would bear productively in plantations , we found it would not , and were obliged to cut them all down . I lost my time and my money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had joined me in the venture .
