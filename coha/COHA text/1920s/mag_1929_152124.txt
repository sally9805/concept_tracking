Sirs : <P> Did I not read in TIME some time ( and several TIMES ) ago , that Allan Hoover would not graduate this year because he was away from his studies on his father 's South American good-will tour ? Yet notice the picture and legend which I clip from the Boston Herald of June 30 . Explain please . <P> C. B. HUMPHREY A 13-year-old reader Sakonnet , R. I. <P> Son Allan , able , studied hard , caught up , was graduated with his Class . - ED . <P> Scarlet Sister <P> Sirs : <P> On page 54 of the June 24 issue , TIME , is an item of Ethel Barrymore 's new play . <P> With all due regard to editors &; their right to interpret Webster in various ways ; I can not see how anyone-if they read Scarlet Sister Mary-could by any chance call Scarlet Sister Mary a prostitute . <P> In no sense of the word was she a prostitute . I 'm sure Julia Peterkin , the author , of the book had no intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Evidently the person writing these briefs of " People " either knows nothing of the very remarkable book with all its beauty and philosophy , or he is prejudiced and meant to slur the character which Miss Barrymore will portray in this play . . . . <P> LAURA E. CARSON Oklahoma City , Okla . <P> No slur on Actress Barrymore was intended or contained in TIME 'S report . Scarlet Sister Mary 's publisher advertised her as " The harlot of Blue Brook Plantation. " - ED . <P> Columbine v. Wild Rose <P> Sirs : <P> Enclosed you will find a slip , " Choosing the National Flower . . . . " <P> As far back in years as 1888 or ' 89 I , then a teacher in a public school in a small New York town ( Bernhard 's Bay ) near my home town , became interested in this subject , and when my school of two rooms was polled it was learned that the children , to a soul , voted for the columbine . Since then at different times , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a national flower ; and just happening to read the May Nature magazine , I discovered that the subject of a national flower is being brought forward by that magazine and in the poll of votes printed the wild rose was running far ahead of the columbine . <P> Now , in my estimation , the reason for this popularity of the wild rose , is because of its aggressive assertion of itself . It is thorny and disagreeable to the touch , a thing we do not want in a national flower . If it is picked , it wilts in a few minutes . It comes out a beautiful pink , but before it dies it has faded to a colorless existence . Farmers root it out , as its luxuriant growth soon ruins the fences over which it sprangles . Not one of the phases of its short life , is connected with our desires in a national emblem . The only claim it has upon us that it is fragrant , and pretty , whereas the columbine from the beginning to the end is emblematical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is a subject every American should thoughtfully consider . <P> If the columbine were our national flower , every little immigrant even could have one growing in a tin can . . . . <P> OLA C.
