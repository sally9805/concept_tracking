For five years Senor Alessandri has been President of Chile . About a year ago ( TIME , Sept. 22 , 1924 ) a military junto seized the Government , and told President Alessandri that he could remain in office if he would go away on a six months ' vacation . He went to Europe . Before the six months were up a junto of younger Chilean officers seized the Government from their outraged superiors ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) , told President Alessandri to come back . He came . <P> Recently , Colonel Carlos Ibanez , leader of the young military junto which recalled President Alessandri , decided that he might like to be elected President himself . It would be convenient if Alessandri would resign . Alessandri resigned-after a " quarrel " with Colonel Ibanez . <P> Naturally the Chilean Cabinet also resigned-all save Ibanez , who gave out that he was responsible for the discipline of the nation 's armed forces and could not risk stepping down from his command for even a moment . <P> The resigned President protested that Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidency . The Colonel continued to await the election date , Oct. 24 ; clutched his portfolio none the less tightly . <P> Last week Alessandri realized that the time had come for him to do nothing at all . He did it , leaving at the nominal helm of Chilean affairs Senator Barros Borgono , whom he had appointed Minister of the Interior and President pro tempore.
