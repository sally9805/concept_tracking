A. A. Milne Makes Believe <P> The worst thing that can happen to anybody is to grow up . Growing old is only part of it ; if you do n't grow up , how can you grow old ? People start by making believe they are grown up and then , the first thing they know , they are . The look at their faces , which have gotten lined or baggy or twisted with pretending to be grown up , and they say " That is I. " Sometimes they say " That is me " ; then there is still hope for them . A. A. Milne , who wrote this book , is not like these people . He is good at making-believe , as is shown by the fact that he has written some very good plays , which is only making believe according to the rules made by grownups , who make rules about everything . Now he has written some verses for his friend , Christopher Robin , by name . It is sometimes hard to decide who is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murse , or Hoo . It is probably Hoo , a mysterious person much like a brownie . <P> In a corner of the bedroom is a great big curtain <P> Someone lives behind it but I do n't know who ; <P> I think it 's a Brownie , but I 'm not quite certain . <P> ( Nanny is n't certain , too . ) <P> I looked behind the curtain , but he went so quickly , <P> Brownies never wait to say " How do you do ? " <P> They wriggle off at once because they 're all so tickly . <P> ( Nanny says they 're tickly , too . ) <P> Not all unusual animals are so hard to see , though most of them hate to have to be polite . For instance , at the Zoo <P> There are badgers , and bidgcrs and bodgers , and a Supcr-in-tend-ants House , <P> There are masses of goats , and a polar , and different kinds of mouse <P> And I think there 's a sort of something that 's called-a wall-aboo- <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the Zoo . <P> If you try to talk to the bison , he never quite understands , <P> You ca n't shake hands with a mingo- he does n't like shaking hands . <P> And lions and roaring tigers hate saying " How do you do ? " <P> But I give buns to the elephant when I go down to the Zoo . <P> Elephants , those kingly beasts , get their buns . But there is a rhyme in this book about a King who had a hard time getting so much as a piece of butter for the royal slice of bread . He asked the Queen to tell the Dairymaid to tell the Alderney to be sure to make some butter , but <P> The Alderney Said sleepily <P> " You 'd better tell his Majesty <P> That many people nowadays <P> Like marmalade Instead . " <P> In the end , the Alderney was obedient and made lots of butter . But a certain lady in another rhyme was not obedient . It is sad , the story about her : <P> James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great care of his Mother <P> Though he was only three . <P> James James said to his mother <P> " Mother , " he said , said he ; <P> " You must never go down to <P> the end of the town if you do n't go down with me . " <P> She disobeyed , thinking she could get back in time for tea . She has n't been heard of since , though the King offered a reward . The last verse of this rhyme is like the first ; and after yon have heard all the ones in between , it will not be hard to read it , though it is written this way : <P> J.J. <P> M. M.
