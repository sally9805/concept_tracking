txt IRIUS is visible tonight . Sirius is the Dog Star , the brightest fixed light in the whole aky , and the gem of the winter constellations . Go out as soon as it is dark and look for it . Face south , gaze before you and a little , up . You will surely see it , a green-white , sparkling sun , slowly .. moving in its appointed path across the sky from east to west The whole shell of the sky about us is in rotation , so it seems . We , small motes upon a little grain of dust in the universe , ilmi it hard to realize that it is our speck that whirls , and not the broad expanse of sky . Sirius does not move about us . We turn before it . exposing in succession every meridian of our globe , but so steady and without jarring is our motion that we do not notice it unless-we think . Sirlueis not the largest sun there is . Betelgeux , the red ? giant higher up , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , three hundred million miles , diameter . But Sirius is much larger than the sun . It is a younger sun than ours , and two score or more times as bright . Astronomers have weighed Sirius , . Sirius has a dark companion . In large telescopes it appears as a little , faintly purple star . Astronomers can see It slowly moving about its immensely brighter primary . But the faint star is not small , ' Its mass is a quarter of that of Sirius . It is so heavy that it swings Sirius about in a distinctly perceptible orbit . Watchers noticed this wavy trace across the sky before they found the Acolyto . They knew there was a dark sun there before they saw it . The two go around each other In ' a period of fifty years . The lesser body Is about as far from Sirius as the planet Uranus is from the sun , or about two billion miles . Astronomers constructed a celestial steel yard . They hung the earth and sun on one end and Sirius and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one against the turnings of the other . Sirius and his attendant together weigh 3.26 times as much aa the sun . The attendant star is 1.3 times the mass of the sun , and Sirius ' 1.95 times the mass . On account of the high eccentricity FACS Sown , AND HOLD VeuS MAP OvCR iir.AD of its orbit , the lesser star met. expert ? enco great variations In its heat front Sirius . This probably makes no difference to the star , as it is still in the Incandescent state , but any planets it may have are certainly profoundly In ? fluenced . Imagine you were on one of these hypothetical worlds , situated near the little star . One sun would shed a weird blue light , like the purple spotlight of a projecting lantern , while Sirius would blaze out in the distance with A raw , harsh glare . Sirius has none or the modifying layers of the nun . His photosphere is practically on Abe surface , and his light is crude and untenipared .
