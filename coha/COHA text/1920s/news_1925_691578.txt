txt President and Mrs. Coolidge reached Washington at 8 o'clock this morning from their 2.500-mile trip to the Northwest , obviously happy and with a healthy tan produced by sun and wind . The President walked with an elastic step , apparently physically stronger from his daily beefsteak diet . He still had the broad smile acquired in returning the welcome of the 200.000 or more persons who had greeted him while in the West . As they got into the waiting motor car at the railroad station Mr. and Mrs. Coolidge were again photographed and filmed . Mrs. Coolidge was even more buoyant than while on the trip . She smiled expansively . On their way through groups of arriving and departing traveler4 there were a few cheers but no real demonstration . The President has found plenty of food for thought in the agricultural problems of the West . He does not believe from what he saw and gleaned that the radical proposals for farm relief can be renewed with any hope of success in the next Congress if crop expectations are realized . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing conditions in the industrial EaSt , he found . The farmers are hopeful-but not satisfied . ' They find im ? provement , but are not assured that it win continue or place them on an equality - with the purchasing dollar of the industrial class . Therefore they are still considering their position willigreat seriousness . One thing impressed on members of the President 's party was that if there should be a deflation in wages which would decrease the prices the farmer Pays for all he buys the play of the - economic law of supply and demand would help solve the farm questions of the Northwest if not , then artificial stimulation of prices for farm products through Federal legislation promises to be an issue of political importance in the next Congress . This issue may be revived , according to prevailing opinion , even though conditions do not warrant it , by a group playing upon prejudices and the sad plight of the farmer . Seeks Light on Congress Course . President Coolidge intends to get at first hand the best opinion as to how the next Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as his guests this Summer several leading practical farmers and Republican politicians who will present both sides of the problem . In addition to this , Secretary Jardine will make a series of speeches next month in the wheat belt and will study on ' the ground the needs of the producers . Secretary Hoover is scheduled to do the same thing . Both have been requested to recommend to the President the best method to help the farmer and to give attention to the threat now being made by certain members of Congress to break down the protective tariff on farm products unless another artificial medium is given by the Government to push up the price of wheat . This threat implies that Republican members of Congress from the wheat States will unite with the Democrats to reduce tariff schedules all along the line to Democratic standards unless the Government finds a means to raise the price of wheat to a point where it will put the farmer on the same plane with the protected industrialist of the East . The farmers assert that experience has shown that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat is ineffective . it protects , they say , only those producing hard wheat against the similar Canadian product , but does not help the majority of farmers . The protective tariff , it is declared , is not looked upon by most farmers as giving the same degree of protection as in years past They say it protects the manufacturer and works against the agriculturist Everything they buy , they assert , is higher because of the tariff and that other artificial barrier , restricted immigration . The latter , they declare , permits labor to keep up the high pre-war wage scale . Stimulated by some of the agitators who formed the backbone of different agrarian movements , and aided by a few Republicans of standing , many Western ! farmers have raised up two bugaboos before the regular Republicans who still cling hopefully to the tariff as the outstanding issue of the country . Farmer agitators say that in time they will be able to convince enough voters of the ' West to elect members of Congress 1 favorable to low tariff , and by union with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . This movement is said to be more than a gesture . It is seriously conceived , but can not be brought about in a short time . Representative A. J. Dickerson of Iowa , the farm group leader in the House , 553-s the movement is practical , hut lie does not want tho union with the Democrats carried oat if the Republican Party will find the artificial means to raise the price of farm products . Complaints of the Farmers . The reasoning of the group behind the implied threat is that the manufacturer - has proction to give him prosperity , Iaher has restricted immigratior holding down the number of workers and permitting the present labor class to get the wages they demand . while the farmer has nothing , they say , to aid him . : ionic of them admit . however . that the Republicans have done all that appears possible along the tariff way by increasing the duty on wheat 50 per eent through the elastic tariff ' clause approved by President Coolidge . The basic : argument cf the present g:tation is tht't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price-fixing and cxporting law . as outlined in the , en bill , they will be satisfied , as they will then have what the manufacturer and the laborer have in tariff and xestr:cted im migration . " Give us the : %leNary-Hang.en law in sonic shape that will do the work . or we will do what we can to break down the protection given the others , " they say . These agitators , not now very strong or well organized , are credited - with not actually desiring free trade . but with a wish to frighten the Republican Party into enacting a price-fixing law for farm products , and some of the Republican leaders of the Northwest are showing some alarm Coolidge Against Price Fixing . ' The question before Mr. Coolidge is what shall be done to satisfy the farrner7 . The President is opposed to price-fixing and will not agree to such legislation . He favors cooperative marketing , diversification of crops and some system of aid through Government warehouses , but these the farm group rejected in the last Congress . . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Congress reassembles in December than it was in the last Congress . He hopes that crop conditions at home and abroad will force up prices received by the American farmer . The President knows , ' it is asserted . that if this proves to be the case , there will be no need to worry about the threat . If it is not , it may be necessary to , Jo something in the way of legislation more acceptable to the farmer than cooperative marketing and the plans embraced in his last year 's agricultural program . For that reason , Secretaries Jardine and Hoover will be his . observers in the West this Summer to learn the truth of the radical agrarian movement . and work out a solution to fit the actual situation among the farmers in the Autumn . The.farrn situation is said to be the only thing politically that is worrying President Coolidge today . He knows after his trip West that there is , .. soine unrest there still , but lie has not ' ascertained its extent or how effective it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie writes his message to the next Congress .
