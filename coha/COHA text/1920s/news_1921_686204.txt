He had a remarkable record for accomplishing great things in that profession before he put on khaki . He is a man of unusual powers of observation . ffis mind is analytical , and at the same time he has the gift of imagination . Practical ? yet in no small degree idealist , he was eminently fitted both to tell the story of modern engineering in the field and to describe his experiences at the front with French and British troops in a spirited and sympathetic manner , so that they are shown to the reader as bravo and steadfast allies whose comrade . ship in the great ordeal should never he forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The American Engineers in France , " it may he said that Colonel Parsons writes as well as he imiltrailroads and bridges and solved emergency . problems ? ?

In their counterattack some ten days later the British were in turn surprised by the enemy and beaten back for most of the distance they hail gained in the tank action .

" At one point the American engineers , unarmed and unready , were caught in the vortex of the attack , the German infantry swarming over the British lines .

The engineers " seized anyweapons at hand . some seized picks and shovels , and defend- ed themselves . One brawny American laid five of the-enemy out with a shovel before he dropped . " This irregular body , " says the author , " undoubtedly delayed the advance along the main Cambrai-Gouzeaucourt road until the troops in reserve could he oersted to make an organized stand .

An unexpected return to service with the " TOMMiCS " was " hailed with wild enthusiasm , and half of the men in this American command were Irish or men of Irish descent . " The British were liked because they were good comrades , helpful , cheerful , never tragic in mood , brave to fault when properly led , and always to he depended upon to stand and die , if need were , when the battle went against them .
