txt A. gratifying diversity of opinion is shown by the poll of the farmers of this State on the referendum of the American Farm Bureau Federation . The diversity is gratifying as showing that the farmers have opinions apart from their Interests . The idea/ would be for all citizens to vote as citizens , regardless of interests . That is a mere ideal , for all are influenced by their interests , the farmers included . A good deal further along that line than the farmers have gone there is danger of our being ruled by interests , which Is as bad as being ruled by classes . It is surprising to find that the farmers of New York are 59 per cent . against the Great Lakes waterway , which was pressed upon them as a cheap route for their products and a correction for excessive railway rates . The reasons are not given with the referendum for any votes , and it is only conjecture that the farmers do not think that private funds can be found for any great enterprises now , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also is surprising that the farmers are 0. ) per cent . in favor of a general sales tax . It had been thought that the farmers had been impressed by the talk that a sales tax would be paid by them for the relief of the rich . But 75 per cent . favor continuation of the excess profits taw . Farm-to-market roads are favored by 94 per cent . over transcontinental roads . That is the better for the country as well as for the farmers . Waterway development is disfavored by 52 per cent. , perhaps because waterway development has been disappointing in results . The returns show that 86 per cent . are against short selling , and it would be interesting to know just what proportion know what short selling is in either theory or practice . Constitutional prohibition of tax-exempt securities is favored by 77 per cent . The issuance of unsuspected billions of them has disturbed the farmers ' Mortgage money market . " Truth in fabric " legislation is favored by 97 Per cent. , conceivably because farmers are raisers of wool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staple is certification of the fabric , for there are all sorts of virgin wool , and some mixtures are better than the pure wool . It is a trade difference between the farmers and the traders entitled to their different views . The farmers want the packers regulated , and some want the farmers regulated . The farmers think they could move more of their products if rail ' way rates were lower , and so does everybody else . But the railways must be sustained if they are to move anybody 's products , and transportation is now being sold below cost of production , - which nobody is entitled to . The list is too long to be run completely through . Enough of the per1Centages are given to show that there is not complete uniformity of opinion among the farmers , and that they are no more selfish in their views than most of us . There are no more substantial citizens than the farmers , and they are entitled to their points of view . A great deal of what they favor for themselves ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection to anything in the mere fact that the farmers favor it .
