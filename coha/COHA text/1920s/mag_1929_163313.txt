Laggard students who flunk and repeat courses cost more to educate than smart ones who pass everything . This is manifestly unfair in a public school-system in which each student should benefit from the same amount of the public funds . W. M. Kern , school superintendent of Walla Walla , Wash. , believes that laziness accounts for most failures . Last week he asked his school board to evaluate a high school education , suggested $480 , or $30 per course . He would have students who repeat courses pay $30 per repetition . Thus , he said , " no pupil could complain since each ... would have as much money spent on him as any other . "
