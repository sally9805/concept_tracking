<P> A polite tempest of gossip and denial that the great Earl of Birkenhead would resign as Secretary of State for India was finally stilled , last week , when he , burly , brilliant and socially lionized , despatched to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin a lengthy letter . Suave , it concluded : " The moment of parting is always sad . Your own personality has converted a Cabinet which assembled upon the crater of some bitter and recent memories into a band of brothers . I leave them and you with emotion and , if I may be allowed to say so , with affection . " - Birkenhead . <P> Reason : money-it being notorious that the pay of a Cabinet Minister* has proved too meager to support the extravagant whims* of Lord Birkenhead , who was . before he took Cabinet rank , " the highest feed barrister in England . " <P> Lord Peel .

Lord Peel is the eldest son of the youngest son of the same potent progenitor . Lord Peel inherits the title of Viscount from his father , who received it upon his retirement as Speaker of the House of Commons . <P> When one speaks of " Lady Peel ' ' one correctly refers to either : 1 ) Ella Viscountess Peel , prim ; or 2 ) Beatrice Lillie , flippant . It was the latter Lady Peel , of course , who recently originated the jest of calling every U. S. citizen residing west of Manhattan a " Middlie Westie . " <P> Early in 1920 Beatrice Gladys Lillie wed Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still her only child . His destiny is to head the Peel line and inherit 10,000 acres . Shortly his irrepressible mother will open in Manhattan as the star of Noel Coward 's This Year of Grace , London 's superhit revue of the season . <P> <P> * 5,000 : $24,300 . <P> <P> * Especially rare book collecting .
