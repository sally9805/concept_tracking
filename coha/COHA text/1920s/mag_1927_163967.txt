De Ormond ( " Tuss " ) McLaughry , Brown football coach , paid tribute at an alumni dinner to eleven other iron men- the Brown football team that played through the season undefeated. * He derided the idea that he fed his protgs on milk . " Music , " he said , " is what makes Iron Men . The players depend on rhythm and morale , and unless you have a singer or two on the squad you have a tough time keeping up the morale . Whenever we were in the train on the way to a game I always made them start a song . . . . " <P> *The same eleven men conquered Yale , Dartmouth and Harvard on successive Saturdays , using no substitutes until the last four minutes of play in the last of the three games .
