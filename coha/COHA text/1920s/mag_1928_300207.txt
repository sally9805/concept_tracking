Parched and stinking , Bahrein Island barely breaks the surface of the Persian Gulf . European pates soon addle , uninsulated from its vicious sun . Before its troughs of rotting oysters , queasy European nostrils quail . Impervious to sun and stink , Arab traders hunker down , paddle the bubbling compost , comb it with their fingers . <P> A blue-gummed , henna-bearded gaffer , Jack Horner-like , pulls out a lump . Feverishly he wipes the gluey carrion on a corner of his burnoose . Marshallah ! A rose-pink pearl , pale , perfect , **28;10516;TOOLONG the first casual pawing of the opened shells . <P> Wrapped in a shred of muslin and tucked in a soiled sash , the Pink Pearl is taken to Linga , across the Gulf . There appraisers sit with ancient scales , chaffer to the utmost kran , * seal their purchase with a solemn glass of tea . From Linga , the Pink Pearl journeys to Bombay or Bagdad , where foreign experts laud its lustre , symmetry , and flawlessness ; drive less ceremonious bargains ; swaddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elated , to the great jewellers of Fifth Ave. , Bond St. , Rue de la Paix . <P> Fifty-nine such Pink Pearls were recently threaded by Black , Starr &; Frost ( Manhattan ) into one exquisite necklace , delicately blended , delicately matched . Amateur and professional connoisseurs last week acclaimed it the most magnificent in existence ; exhausted superlatives ; declared $685,000 a reasonable price . <P> Pearls fall into two main classes : true pearls and freshwater pearls . True pearls , or " orientals , " are formed in oysters by the deposition of concentric layers of nacre , an iridescent substance , around a microbe or some other irritant . Freshwater pearls are formed in molluscs out of non-nacreous material , and are far less lustrous and valuable . <P> Four factors determine choice of true pearls : size , color , symmetry , and lustre . Size , of course , is immediately dependent on the length of the collector 's purse , but the other three are judged by his taste and knowledge . <P> Imprimis , color : avicula margaritifera , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offspring is white , sometimes pink , yellow , blue , black , but unless they are grotesquely malformed , all are precious . In the Far East , cream yellow is the favorite tint because it shows to excellent advantage against the Oriental skin . Similarly , Westerners prefer pink pearls ; not a deep pink , which is almost invariably muddy , but a pale rose . Color can best be examined by placing the pearl on white cotton under a strong natural light . <P> Item , symmetry : for earrings or a single pendant , the teardrop pearl is still fashionable , but for necklaces , bracelets , and tiaras , perfect sphericity is required . Experts know it on sight . Amateurs roll their pearls across a smooth black surface . <P> Item , lustre : for which there is neither test nor definition . It is the mellow glow emanating from an unblemished " skin , " soft , warm , alive . If pearls are held between the eye and the light , some will show a translucent encircling band about one-fifth the width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
