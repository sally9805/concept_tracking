MANY cities have had their famous cats , but in this respect New York is sadly deficient . There once lived a cat in Venice to whom the Czar of all the Russias sent his visiting card and to whom a memorial was afterwards inscribed . Paris is renowned for her cat population in general . There is a feline , however , who sits on the southeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Forty-fourth Street , near a flower store , that ought to be famous . All New Yorkers who love a mighty cat should visit this creature 's haunt and pay their respects . ALTHOUGH Emory Buckner has not been able to give much time to the liquor question because of the alien property scandal , evidence that Prohibition is a howling success is still pouring in .

Bibliophile SCARCELY a week passes without news that someone somewhere has paid the highest price ever paid for something , and last week was no exception . The press had it that Otto Vollbehr had bought a Gutenberg Bible for $275,000 and so he had . What is more , Dr. Vollbehr , whose home is in Berlin and whose library totals 14,000 volumes , is now in New York with 3,000 of those books . It came about this way . Dr. Vollbehr , who is a tremendous enthusiast , brought over a lot of his rare and early religious books to show the Cardinals at the Eucharistic Congress in Chicago last summer . Then he ran into Col. Edwin Emerson , an old friend and a member of the National Arts Club , who persuaded him to hold an exhibit there . It is on now and will last until the middle of October . It includes one of the greatest existing collections of incunabulacradle-books , so called because they were the first , printed between 11-55 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Vollbehr is an affable , baldheaded gentleman in his fifties . He is , or was , by profession a chemist . His first visit to this country was years ago when he had been sent on a trip around the world to complete his education . Landing in San Francisco he made the acquaintance of Mr. Sutro , most famous of the old gold millionaires , and in Sutro 's library he acquired his first interest in book collecting . Fifteen or sixteen years ago he was hurt in a railroad wreck , and it left him so nervous that the doctors insisted he take up something to occupy his mind . So his thoughts returned to Sutro 's books , and since then collecting has been his main interest . With him it is an intimate and personal passion . He has hunted his books himself through all the old monasteries and castles of central Europe . He travels about a great deal . He and his wife run over from Berlin to southern California for a few months every winter . He explains that an added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he takes a personal interest , because it has many books which he used to own .

He is a merry soul , and he may be seen every day at the National Arts Club -- -this man who paid more for a hook than any man ever paid before  --  personally in charge of his exhibit .

" Lords and Artists OSSIP in various studios about kJ town to the effect that new decorations in the English House of Lords were to be done by an American artist , has caused considerable comment , and meantime Dean Cornwell , the man who has been given the commission , is FASHIONS IN FIRST NIGHTERS A BROADWAY REVUE THE THEATRE . GUILD THE SUPER-MOVIE quietly preparing , without turning the famous hair , for his two years ' absence in England on the job . Just who will take Cornwell 's place during this interval as the famous illustrator of yarns by Ibanez , Barrington , Cobb , Fyne , et al. , in the popular story-magazines , is problematical . The room in which the murals are to be painted has been left unadorned for many years , we understand , not because England lacked a sufficiently great artist , but because there was no event worthy of commemoration . The one painting now hanging in the room is of the Battle of Waterloo by a Scotchman , Daniel Maclise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worthy of the attention of either lords or artists . Recently , however , Frank Brangwyn was commissioned to make the designs for the vacant panels , and these have at last been completed , representing the various British colonies . Of the ten panels in all , two of them will he a hundred feet long by thirty feet high , and the others twenty feet square . The general design is that of a tapestry , made in accordance with the fifteenth-century Gothic architecture of the room . The artists of London , anxiously awaiting Brangwyn 's appointment of an assistant , which would obviously entail the execution of his designs , were dismayed to learn that the job had been given to our own Dean Cornwell . T h e fact that Brangwyn the past ten years . He has a studio at 58 West Fifty-seventh Street , and lives on Sixty-seventh Street when he is n't at his country house in Mamaroneck .

Philosophic N 0 ONE seems to be more sur-prised at the astounding sale of 50,000 copies of " The Story of Philosophy " than Will Durant himself , the slim , bearded Canadian who wrote it . A publisher-about-town in forms is a Welshman , originally from Bruges , and is a bit indifferent to his English cousins , may possibly have had something to do with the choice , but probably not . DEAN CORNWELL has worked for Brangwyn before , having returned from England only last spring after executing two additional panels of a mural in Skinner 's Hall which Brangwyn had begun twenty years before . Incidentally , a clause has just been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his death , Cornwell shall be allowed to complete all of his work . Cornwell is a big , blond , vigorous fellow with a determined jaw and , despite horn-rimmed spectacles , a rugged aspect . He is thirty-four years old . Born in Kentucky , he has lived most of his life in New York and he has exhibited his work here frequently during cause of his previous experience with the " Coronation of King Edward , " which he painted and which proved too great a strain . We gather that it was not the large number of portraits of lords and ladies required in the background which wore him down , but the distressing tendency of these lords and ladies to forget their appointments for sittings entirely . Even when they did remember to come , they often arrived at Abbey 's studio anywhere from one to six hours late . Modern Miss AYOUNG lady to whom traffic rules meant nothing and who did n't see why she should wait for any foolish green light to flash , got halfway across Fifth Avenue safely between dashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Avenue when she spied , near by , in us that Durant always thought that his publishers were doing him a favor by printing his work , and so certain was he that there could be no important market for it that he returned his proofs with the request that his corrections be disregarded in case they should be too expensive to make . Never before had an author been so considerate of his publishers . Durant , we are glad to inform an anxious public , is not without a romantic Lincolnian legend concerning his early educational struggles . It seems that though he was born in North Adams , Mass. , he was some ten years old before he spoke any language but French . On his eleventh birthday , however , having been given eleven cents , and having heard of a certain English hook called " David Copper-field , " he is said to have trudged three miles to a bookstore in order to buy it .

Sixteen years later he began work on his own book , this season 's best non-fiction seller . The history of " The Story of Philosophy " contains the usual element of business romance . E. Haldeman-Julius , of Kansas , father of the five-cent classics , had agreed to publish the volume , but he was crowded with work . One day while in New York he asked Simon &; Schuster if they would take it over . They did , as a favor , hoping they would break even en it . Now it has already had a bigger sale than Van Loon 's " The Story of Mankind " and is going better than Wells ' famous " Outline " did during its first season . Scent I ? VAS not announced at C. C.

Business Administration IT WILL doubtless cheer those who I have been frantically trying to have telephones installed in new apartments during the usual First of October rush , to hear of the Mayor 's triumph . On Monday , September 27 , His Honor put in an order for twenty-six telephones to be installed at his residence on St. Luke 's Place . On Tuesday the 28th , surprisingly enough , the wires were up and the telephones installed and ready for service on Wednesday . They are all private wires , connected directly with Albany , Tammany Hall and twenty-four other strategic points .

" Tunnel Progress NOW that the Governors of New York and New Jersey have driven through the vehicular tunnel it develops that nothing more important to the citizen of New York than the completion of this tunnel is likely to happen in some time . If it really means the doing away with the ferry nuisance , it is as important as the doing away with Hylanism which took place some time ago . As time goes on , more and more people are to be met who have been down into the tunnel and looked at it . They report variously . What it actually looks like is an extremely long , tiled bathroom with mud on the floor . There are a few work trucks in it at the moment , and their reverberating exhaust seems to augur little good for the eardrums when the place becomes full of hooting tourists ; but they say that it wo n't be unbearably noisy . The fact that it will be full will ease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most agreeable . To beauty-conscious New York , the exit and entrance portals and the arrangement of open squares and avenues of approach are more important than they are to the engineers , who are proud of the ventilating system and let it go at that . So far nothing has been done , to our knowledge , regarding the architectural and sculptural aspects . A block or so of houses has been cleared away on Varick Street and the residents of Little Italy , below the present terminus of Sixth Avenue ( erroneously called Greenwich Village by the newspapers ) have been asked to move in order to permit the extension of the avenue as far south as Canal Street . But these are all engineering measures . Very sensibly , the authorities are going to open the tunnel first and beautify it afterward . As to the beautifying , the only sentiment audible is a rather violent one against anything that looks like Civic Virtue , either as a symbol or as a statue . This is , at least , a healthy state of mind . Color N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promenade , only a fashionable procession of shoppers , heavily diluted with shop girls , life insurance agents and Broadway overflow , we have been seeking elsewhere for a street which still retains the loafing stroll as its tempo . Broadway at certain hours approaches the desired effect in its own way , but does n't quite THE NEW YORKER 21 succeed . Seventh Avenue , on the other hand , between 127th and 134th streets , especially on the east side of this wide boulevard , is still the real thing in promenades . It is Harlem 's Fifth Avenue , without Fifth Avenue 's fevered pace . Here the elite of colored New York stroll almost any evening in a true Sunday-a f ternoon-in-thepark manner , Here the young men in evening clothes and jaunty derbies or in more sporting outfits of spats , colored shirts , trick canes , loiter on the corners or in front of theatres and laugh with wide-mouthed abandon at their heavy jokes . Here , past these young men , with sublime unconsciousness , dusky young school girls go arm in arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , leading their favorite hound or poodle ; and a group of mammies exchanging gossip as though in a small-town back yard , mingle with flashy young flappers tawdry with lavender face powder . PROSPPROSPEROUS old men with EROUSgold watchchains slung ponderously over wide bellies stroll on this strange street and amiably circle flocks of pickaninnies playing marbles in the middle of the sidewalk . Limousines turn suddenly from the boulevard into side streets and disgorge flocks of smartly dressed negroes who disappear quietly into apartment houses or night clubs . And the usual group of colored taxidrivers at corners may as likely as not be shooting craps on the curb without attracting the least attention . All the while not a white face in sight . Maybe a high-yellow , a picaroon , a pale mulatto , but more often blacks and golden hrowns . Harlem takes its ease on one of the widest and most lovely avenues in the city and although it is but a half-hour from Times Square , it might be a stage set for Egypt in Modern Clothes .

The Legal Mind PINNING another story on the in- nocent college professor may be taking advantage of a helpless class , but in this case there is no help for it ; for the Professor tells it on himself . He went into an antique shop in Italy and was rash enough to enthuse over a painting by an old master . " But of course , " he said to the dealer , " I 'm not one who can afford such things . " And buying a small article he returned to his pension . The next day the picture arrived . " Oh , yes , " said the dealer , coldly when he went to protest , " You definitely bought this picture yesterday , and I 'm afraid you 'll have to pay for it . I intend to bring suit . " Wounded , confused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his  --  a lawyer . " Certainly I 'll take the case , " the lawyer said , after carefully examining the picture , " and you do n't need to worry about the fee . By the way , was there anyone else in the shop when you were there ? " " No , " said the Professor . " That 's the trouble . " He had very little hope . And when at the trial the dealer produced two witnesses who swore they had heard the Professor order the picture sent to his pension , the last ray flickered and went out . Then his own lawyer got up . " Did you leave the shop before my client , here ? " he asked the witnesses . " Yes . " " Well , " he said , producing three respectable-looking citizens , " I have three witnesses who were in the shop later and who saw my client pay for the picture . " In this way the Professor became the owner of an exceedingly valuable work of art , Then the lawyer called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said affably . " I 'll just take the picture . " And putting it in his cab , he departed . The Professor is still confused . Playing the Game THE week-end produced a story from one of the public golf courses in the suburbs , over which suddenly broke a violent thunderstorm . Golfers of both sexes rushed for shelter . The clubhouse porch was crowded . During the worst of it a large , hustling woman , wet to the skin , struggled up the hill to safety . " My dear , " she shrieked , " I do n't mind the water  --  but do you know what happened ? I never was so frightened in my life ! The lightning came on so suddenly , and there I was with an iron club in my hand  --  but anyway , I had the presence of mind to hand it to the caddy .
