Mr. H. G. Wells has felt the necessity for a new approach to his rostrum , an impressive , unpoliced approach that will at once command unusual attention and leave him freer than ever to expatiate upon the human spectacle . In The Outline of History he had to deal dutifully with many matters of transient and undisputed consequence . Moreover , history is but the gradient leading up to Mr. Wells ' deepest concern , the future of mankind after its scientific emancipation . In his pseudo-scientific novels , several of which he laid in that far future , he felt the cramp of plot and character relations . So while he calls his latest creation* a novel , it stays little closer to the usual kind of thing meant by that term than did James Joyce 's Ulysses . <P> The Approach . Perhaps it was that colossal , utterly abandoned effort by Mr. Joyce to glut up and put on paper the total sensory-esthetic experience of a handful of slovenly Dubliners during 24 hours that encouraged Mr. Wells to cast pattern to the winds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a British scientist reminiscent on and after his 59th birthday . <P> It happens that Mr. Wells will be 60 next Tuesday . It happens that his character , William Clissold , enunciates a prodigious amount of Wellsian philosophy . But the " vulgar " reader and reviewer are asked to understand that the book is not Mr. Wells ' autobiography , but William Clissold 's . The latter is merely a " relative " of Mr. Wells , a mineralogist whose promoter-father committed suicide on the way to prison , leaving the mother free to remarry and the boys , William and Dickon Clissold , to make their own lives . <P> William Clissold is in London on his 59th birthday . It is dismally wet , so he falls to writing down what it feels like to realize that one 's life is some four-fifths finished . Later he writes on and on , mostly in the mas ( villa ) in Provence where he lives with a young woman named Clementina , trying to make plain to himself and the world the nature and origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economic , ethical , etc . To make this writing wholly natural , Mr. Wells permits William Clissold to mention encounters with Dean Inge , Dr. Jung , George Bernard Shaw and many another real person whom a fairly eminent scientist could scarcely help meeting . ( English reviewers have been choking fretfully over this feature . ) The Mottoes . There are two mottoes for this book . One is quoted from Heraclitus : " pavra pei - All things change ( flow ) . " The other is inadvertently inserted by Author William Clissold-H . G. Wells : " This book , at any rate , is not going to be a home of rest for the tired reader . " <P> This second motto is self-explanatory . Here is no light Wellsian fantasy with a happy ending . Having written two volumes , William Clissold dies in an . automobile smash , as related by his brother in the epilogue.
