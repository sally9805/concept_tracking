MR . PETRE-Hilaire Belloc ( Illustrated by G. K. Chesterton ) - McBride ( $2.50 ) . When the grey little man in the taxi ejaculated " Petrel " and hastily explained he was talking to himself , the cabbie smiled sympathetically . But the clerk at the Hotel Splendide knew better . He completed the name most deferentially-John K. Petre-without being told . And Mrs. Celia Cyril ( whoever she was ) seemed enchanted with John K. Petre ( whoever he was ) . The two ex-chancellors agreed , the Old Cabinet Minister hemmed affably . So the little grey man guessed he was John K. Petre without doubt , evidently a U. S. millionaire and a devil of a fellow for secrecy and mystification . He kept his counsel , was enigmatically acquiescent with the broker chap . He made thousands in Touaregs ( whatever they were ) , millions on the Paddenham Site ( for some reason ) , millions more in Rotors ( strange as it seemed ) . <P> Harley Street magnificos availed him naught . Not until he bumped into old Buff Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Peter Blagden , " Mr. Peter " to family servants and solicitors . When the real Petre ( John Kosciuszko Petre , U.S.A. ) spurred an action , all the King 's legal horses and men balked valiantly and the episode ended happily for nearly every one . <P> Dedicated " to all poor gentlemen , " here is Belloquacity far less irritating than usual . Donald O. Stewart and other funny men would find the conversations instructively preposterous . G. B. Shaw could pick up pointers in the whetting of satirical barbs .
