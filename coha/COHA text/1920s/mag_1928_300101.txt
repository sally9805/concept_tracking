Book suppressed , author fined ! Such was the verdict of the courts , last week , in the case of a Laborite scrivener who had dared to attack the omnipotent Shoe Tycoon of Czechoslovakia , THOMAS BAT'A. * <P> The scrivener , one Herr Rudolph Philipp , had called his savage book , Der Unbekannte Diktator. + <P> With bitter pen he wrote : " Thomas Bat'a is the Henry Ford of Shoes . . . . But Ford , in comparison with Bat'a , is a model of uprightness and humanity . . . . Zlin , the Bat'a Shoe City , is a second Detroit , but a Detroit with low wages . . . . Bat'a speeds up his workers to greater and yet greater output . . . shameless exploitation . . . lower wages than in other Czechoslovakian shoe factories . . . wanton exploitation of the workers , mostly young men and women . . . . " <P> Even were all these charges true , it might still be argued that Der Unbekannte Diktator deserves well of Czechs and Slovaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded young Czechoslovakia 's shoe industry that today she exports more footgear than old , easy-going Britain or revamped , laborious Germany . <P> Since all Empires have been bought with blood , and since all Emperors have been deemed glorious , Shoe Tycoon Bat'a need not necessarily mind that the International Federation of Trade Unions has officially denounced him thus : <P> " In the Bat'a factories inhumanity and the exploitation of the workers are brought to a fine art . . . . The ' Ford of Zlin ' prospers . . . but his success is built upon the living flesh and blood of . . . workers . " <P> In Jerusalem , Amsterdam , Calcutta , Berlin and hundreds of other cities the sign Bat'a is displayed above a store which is the acme of modernity . Indeed a pilgrim to the Holy City will find that Bat'a 's shoe shop in Jerusalem has " done " its windows in smart " modernistic " squares and angles . <P> Salespersons in the Bat'a shops , from Singapore to Prague , are well primed with " House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of six he teased and teased until his shoemaker father whittled him out a tiny last on which with boyish zeal he pegged toy shoes . At 18 the Founder had saved 400 kronen ( $80 ) , the fruit of hard pegging and self denial . Also his sister Anna and his brother Anthony ( now dead ) had each saved 400 kronen , so runs the legend . Thereupon , in 1894 , with a total capital of $240 , the three Bat'as founded their own small shoe factory . <P> Oft told is the story-with-a-moral that during the first year of business Thomas Bat'a became swelled-headed and assumed the airs of a " Gentleman Manager . " Upon discovering that the firm was losing money , however , he renounced gentility " and ever since hard work has been his hobby . " Employes of the Founder also know that he , like Henry Ford , is a prohibitionist in theory and an abstainer in practice . <P>                  @ @ @
