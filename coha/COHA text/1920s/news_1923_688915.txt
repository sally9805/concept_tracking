txt Wall Street experienced considerable excitement at the opening yesterday when numerous Stock ' Exchange houses discovered in their mails what appeared to be identical , fictitious orders from banks in eastern and New England states , but mostly in Pennsylvania , for the purchase of certain stocks in rather large amounts , each order being accompanied by a cashier 's check for $15,000 on account . In each case the brokerage house was instructed to purchase the stocks named for account of a client of the bank and to deliver the stock certificates to certain local banks , correspondents of the out-of-town institutions . It was on the submission of the letters and checks to these local banks by some brokerage houses for verification that the checks were found to be spurious and the orders presumably fictitious .
