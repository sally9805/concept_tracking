txt HOLES IN SWISS CHEESE AFFECT ITS SALE HERE Swiss cheese makers , like many other European food manufacturers , find the greater part of their pre-war business lost to them , due to the United States itself producing a large part of its requirements in their line . The most potent factor in taking away the Europeans ' market was the packing of cheese in bars instead of round loaves . These bars were found to be less wasteful , furnishing a slice of the exact size for a sandwich , and necessitating the purchase of only a small quantity at a time . The large holes in the imported Swiss cheese are an impediment to its employment in sandwich making , as the buyer of the sandwich thinks he or she is being cheated out of the cheese which should be in the holes . Granted the flavor of the imported cheese is much better , how many eaters ever find it out ? E. A. NIES . New York . May 31 , 1927.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
