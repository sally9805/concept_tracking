Television , so far , has been an amusement for amateur electricians and material for Sunday newspaper sections . That television might soon be something else was indicated last week by an advertisement which appeared upon financial pages . <P> The advertisement made it known that C. C. Kerr &; Co. , of the New York Curb Market were offering for sale 250,000 shares of common stock priced at $10 a share in the Jenkins Television Corp . ( total capitalization $10,000,000 ) . The purpose of the Jenkins Television Corp. , as expressed in a letter written by President James W. Garside , was to " transmit or broadcast television pictures and programs ; to transmit photographs ... to engage in the broad development , exploitation and sale of television and image transmitting apparatus . . . . " The advertisement pointed out that the development of television so far has paralleled that of the early development of radio ; and it indicated that Jenkins Television Corp . hoped to duplicate - the grandeur of Radio Corp . of America . <P> Whether it will do so or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new organization depends largely on the past and future prowess of C. Francis Jenkins , who invented " the first practical motion picture projector , " and whose laboratories have recently been devoted to televisionary experiments . The announcement of the new capitalization came at a time when Wall Street was talking of nothing but the break in the market and made therefore less stir in financial circles than it would have a week before . <P> It made however a stir in sections of Manhattan where business is the subject of smart chatter . In the smart restaurants of lower Park Avenue , headwaiters consulted patrons differentially but earnestly . There were two reasons why they did so : Headwaiters yield only to speakeasy owners as shrewd investors ; many a headwaiter was acquainted with the young and impressive Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr . who was named to head the board of directors of the Jenkins Television Corp . <P> Like almost every presentable young club member in Manhattan , Anthony Biddle Jr. , has been called the city 's best dressed man . At the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Benjamin Newton Duke , the tobacco king. * Tongues wagged and darted , but the Biddies , in Palm Beach , Newport and Manhattan , for which they had deserted the native Biddle heath of Philadelphia , gave evidence of marital contentment . Tony Biddle played tennis , squash and swam , occasionally boxing at the Racquet Club to show that he was not afraid of being hurt , thus found many business enterprises in which to interest himself and his fortune . <P> Not all of these enterprises are connected with Wall Street . Biddle , along with social register companions , was accused only a fortnight ago of sharing with Mayor Walker a plot to convert the dismal restaurant which now sits like a spider , webbed with paths , at the centre of Central Park , into a civic banquet hall , thus encouraging patronage and improving the circumstances of the waiters who are employed there by the present lessee , Theatrical Zitell.
