In Europe Bela Bartok 's piano concerto has been hailed as his most mature , his strongest work , as the real Bartok , maker of naked , unashamed music . It was , fairly enough , to have served him for his U. S. debut ( TIME , Jan. 2 ) . But Conductor Willem Mengelberg of the New York Philharmonic looked it over ; pronounced it too difficult , rehearsal time too short ; substituted the less characteristic Rhapsody . Last week Fritz Reiner and his Cincinnati Symphony with Bartok himself for soloist , dared the concerto . Manhattan critics disagreed . <P> Said Samuel Chotzinoff ( World ) : " Its belated appearance brought neither joy nor understanding to this reporter . " <P> Pitts Sanborn ( Telegram ) : " ... A mad attempt to catch up with Stravinsky , expressing itself largely in the sort of sonorous tappings that a young and well-fisted child perpetrates when confronted with the keyboard of a piano . " <P> Lawrence Gilman ( Herald-Tribune ) : " ... A new language , harsh , abrupt , austere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ashamed to move us ... unquestionably a work to respect . "
