Fields . Speculative is stock in airplane companies ; somewhat less speculative is stock in flying fields , since though companies may come and go , the flying field remains always necessary . So last week reasoned many an air-minded U.S. investor , offered stock in Roosevelt Field , Inc. , at $18 a share . The new corporation plans to purchase in fee Roosevelt Field , L.I . ( from which Col. Lindbergh made his Paris flight ) and adjacent Curtiss Field , to supply hangars for planes and parking space and a restaurant for the general public . <P> Mausoleums . The traditional " bad man , " asked the conventional question of where he buries his dead , may soon reply , " At Tompkinsville , Staten Island , in the 6,000 mausoleums of Mausoleum Corp . of America . " On the site is room for 4,000 additional crypts . Mausoleum Corp . stock is being marketed at $106 a unit ( 4 Class A , 1 Class B share ) , is held chiefly by organizers .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
