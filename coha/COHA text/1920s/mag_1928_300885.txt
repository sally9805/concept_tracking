They led Julius Shaefer , 10 , onto Curtiss flying field , Long Island . They dragged him close to a plane . He tried to resist , digging his heels into the earth . His big brother climbed into the plane 's cockpit to show that the monster would not bite . They lifted Julius into the machine . Trembling with mute terror he clung to his mother , who also trembled while they put a stout strap about the boy 's waist and fastened it securely to the plane seat . They put double straps about his arms . He tried to scream . He strained at his fastenings , but could only force his hands slightly upward . <P> The plane went up , R. F. Cullman piloting . It roared , it swooped . It turned loops , it careened . It slipped sideways , it banked , it circled . Then it returned to steady earth . The 10-year-old boy was unbound and lifted out , speechless and faint . <P> Futile had been the attempt to cure the young mute by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane ride . Such cures have occasionally resulted when deafness or vocal paralysis was functional . But not when either was organic , as in this case . Julius Shaefer was mute from a lesion in his brain . Yet , his mother , against the objection of her Dr. Samuel C. Reiss , had put her child through the ordeal , stubbornly faithful that science could cure all .
