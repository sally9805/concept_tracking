The Divine Lady ( First National ) . <P> When Admiral Lord Nelson created by his heroic death a stencil for millions of Victorian lithographs , he is said also to have left desolate the most beautiful woman of his time . Lady Hamilton 's white face and big eyes , painted by Romney and Gainsborough , were so widely admired that her elderly husband investigated no rumored infidelities " for fear they might be true . " When Nelson left her to save his country , he asked her to sing for him once more-and there now is heard , apparently issuing from the lips of Corinne Griffith , " You 'll Take the High Road and I 'll Take the Low . " Except for such occasional bathos , and for an effective sound accompaniment of guns and waves , this picture is silent , and the Admiral 's orders to his fleet ( " England expects every man will do his duty " ) and his last words to his aide ( " Kiss me , Hardy " ) are shown in written titles borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Varconi as a handsome Nelson , H. B. Warner as a subtle cuckold , act well in episodes of which the theatricality seems no more than appropriate treatment of an age and a hero also theatrical . Best shot : the cockpit of the thundering Victory . <P> Mr. and Mrs. Griffin , a Catholic couple who lived in a frame house near the railroad station of Texarkana , Tex. , sent their daughter Corinne to the Sacred Heart Convent in New Orleans . When the girl , unanimously elected Queen of the Mardi Gras , went to California to work in the movies , her mother went along , let her change her name to Griffith . Now Corinne Griffith makes $500,000 a year and is said to have the most beautiful back in the world . She lives in an English house in Beverly Hills decorated in French &; Italian styles . Married to Walter Morosco , son of famed Oliver Morosco , she collects jewels , is said to own the biggest existing cabuchon ruby , reads with a magnifying glass the complete works of Poet Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize lily garden , and plays golf badly . Famed for her roles in Outcast , Prisoners , Six Days , she sailed for Europe last week for her " first vacation in five years . " <P> <P> The Cohens and the Kellys in Atlantic City ( Universal ) . Long before their shadows could speak , the Cohens and the Kellys were funny in Manhattan , in Paris . Now on the beach they promote a bathing suit business . Seeing his daughter going away with young Pat Kelly , Cohen telegraphs the Atlantic City police please they should arrest Cohen and Kelly , so the police arrest Cohen Sr. and old Mrs. Kelly arriving there to bring back young Kelly and Cohen ; and then Mrs. Cohen and Papa Kelly come to jail too and Mr. Cohen is so crazy-acting they padlock him alongside an ugly crook . It would be much funnier cut to two reels and without its terrible subtitles . Best shot : Cohen trying to get his wallet away from a dog . <P>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
