Foreign Minister Aristide Briand of France wants to sign a two-power treaty " outlawing war " between his country and the U. S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg insists that the treaty be a multi-power affair " renouncing war as an instrument of national policy . " Out of the clash of these two concepts has come a nine-month long game of diplomatic bean bag ( TIME , July 4 , 1927 ) . Last week M. Aristide Briand sent one more note to Washington from which it appeared that the French position is now , in substance , as follows : <P> 1 ) Great Britain , Italy , Germany and Japan should be invited to state whether they would adhere to the formula of a multi-power treaty which should be submitted to them by the U. S. and France . <P> 2 ) Negotiations looking to the drafting of such a treaty formula should continue between the U. S. and France until one agreeable to both is evolved . <P> 3 ) France now postulates that : " In a general way the obligations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice in any way , previous obligations contained in international instruments , such as the Covenant of the League of Nations , the Locarno agreements or treaties guaranteeing neutrality whose character and scope can not be modified thereby . " <P> 4 ) The initiative of proposing a treaty formula which would meet these and other reservations embodied in the French note last week , is left to the U. S. State Department . <P> At Washington last week Secretary Kellogg dourly intimated that all the French reservations could not be met , but added with an air of quiet determination that the State Department would proceed with the negotiations in a patient and conciliatory spirit .
