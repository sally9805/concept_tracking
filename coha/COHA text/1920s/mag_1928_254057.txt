A long night of quorum calls and Arizona oratory changed the Senate 's mind about not adjourning when the House had suggested . Senator Curtis bided his time until late Tuesday morning , when Senators begin longing for lunch . Then he put again the proposal on which the Senate had split 40-40 the day before . This time the Vice President got no chance to keep his minions at work . The Senators voted 46 to 35 that they had had enough . <P> It has been a so-so session of Congress . President Coolidge congratulated both houses with a warmth which was surprising in view of the lesions Congress had caused in the Administration 's program . Congress had far overshot the Coolidge ideas on farm-relief and flood control ; overcut the Mellon idea of tax reduction ; left stranded the Wilbur " Big Navy " ; appropriated some 500 millions beyond the Budget ; retained Muscle Shoals instead of disposing of it as Mr. Coolidge urged . <P> The amount of work done rather than the kind was evidently what President Coolidge had to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dam bill were the gravest omissions . Disagreement on farm-relief and failure to vote at least some of the Big Navy , after Europe had been made to understand the U. S. really needs more ships , were the gravest embarrassments . <P> In all , 19,777 measures were introduced and 923 successfully passed by the first session of the Seventieth Congress . The second session convenes on Dec. 3 ( the first Monday ) .
