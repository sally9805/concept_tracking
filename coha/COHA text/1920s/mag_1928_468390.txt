ORMAN DOUGLAS has been part of my life since I met him at ? Capri on my first trip abroad in t ie year 1906 . Brought to Europe under the vigilant chaperonage of Elizabeth Cummings , who was a friend of my mother , and a strange little old lady , Mrs. Webb , I arrived at Capri with them , and was installed in a villa which Mrs. Webb took for the winter months , called the Torre Quattro Venti . It be ? longed to old Elihu Vedder , the painter , and was just at the foot of the road that left Capri for Anacapri . In actual fact not only four , but the four and forty winds of Heaven and Hell howled round it day and night and must , I think , have affected the lives of those who lived in it . Mrs. Webb was actuated by the kindest impulses of wanting me to " see life , " broaden my outlook , leave the desolate banks of the Merrimac River and the general provincial American scene , and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I left the home of the most distinguished people I have ever known , my mother and my father , and was taken to Capri . Well ? I met Norman Douglas there , and he gave me a glimpse of Joseph Conrad , and the rest of life at Capri would put the Merrimac River standards of provincialism to shame . However , what are a few dep ? rivations and provincialisms in the scales against a Norman Douglas ? I saw him for the first time one late afternoon at the foot of the villa stairs ( there were one hundred and forty-four to be climbed ) as he was walking downthe Anacapri road . I was between those two good ladies , Mrs. Webb and Eliza ? beth Cummings , and they seemed anxious to keep me there when this rugged , sensitive figure greeted them in one of the most iridescent male voices I have ever heard . He spoke rapidly but very distinctly , with a slight shaping of his words on his under-lip that just es ? caped a lisp . The infinitely varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constantly sliding scale , so that even his pauses were a vibrating sound bridge between words . It was magic , and I was enchanted . To my youthful mind he looked old enough to make it seem a little unkind of those two dear ladies to keep me so buttressed . There was , for instance , a young Count whom they had left me playing Chopin alone to . . . And here was this one , with a terrifyingly intelligent humorous gleam in his eye , a nice Merrimac Valley kind of stick in his hand such as my father used to walk to early Communion with every Sunday morning of his life , an indescribably rich " know " flowing from him , and that voice ! Something had to be done about it . So I did something . I said , from between those two virtuously flanking ladies , in a rather gasping voice , " Wo n't you come to tea ? " He looked at me for a searching moment . " Tea ? No , " he said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only real trees there are on this hellish little island . Come along . " And regardless of the restraining arms and reproving voices of those two good ladies , I just slipped out from between them and . . . went , never daring to look back . " That 's a good girl . You should n't sit up in that cold hole drinking tea . Tea , my God ! Who let you come over here with those two old women ? Ameri ? can parents do n't know the first thing about bringing up children . Have you read Plutarch 's Lives ? Do you learn a column of the dictionary every day by heart ? Well , you should . Tea , indeed ! Come along . . . . I suppose you 've met the Count ? I might have known ! My God ! " So we went , stumbling and scolding along the road . When we reached the little grand-opera piazza of Capri we struck off through some arcades and on to a stony path that went straggling up a hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that motley crew of English , Danish , Polish , German , American estrays who people the island and chatter from tea party to tea party . Many of them I had met through the kindly offices of Mrs. Webb , and so I greeted them in passing . Each one brought forth some lively comment from Douglas , and ribald criticism of the social standards of Mrs. W. and E. C. " So , you know that old thieving harridan , do yon ? I do n't care if she is very well known in America . Look out for your purse and your lovers when she 's about . Have n't got any ? Well you should have . Oh ! These American parents ! " And when another passed , " Beware of that young Danish doctor , now . He is here because he just mur ? dered his old uncle for a paltry one thousand pounds . Yes , he did too . " And still another . " Frantic for three days she 's been , that one , because she 's expecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has n't come . The captain is probably holding it up for blackmail . Nice place you 've come to to finish your education ! Where are your parents , if you have any , which I 'm beginning to doubt ? Where are they ? write them a letter and give them what for . No , I wo n't . Serve them right if you come back a murderer , a drug fiend , and a thief , to say nothing of . . . Ah , well , never mind . Come along . " And I came along . Finally the stony little path stopped before a gate in a high wooden fence . Douglas took a key out of his pocket , put it in a lock of the gate in front of us , turned it , opened the gate , and pushed me in . " There , " he said . " There are some trees ? the only ones on the island . You call all these orange stands trees ? Go in there and look at these ? I own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the only things I own in the world . I 'll come back and get you when I think you 've been there long enough , " and he shut the gate in my face , turned the key in the lock , and started down the path muttering , " Tea , my God , teal " as he walked away . I went in to the trees . That my first impressions of him are more easily conveyed in terms of his conversation than in physical descrip ? tion is possibly due to the tremendous word-association which I have subse ? quently formed about him , as his writ ? ings have developed into important contributions to English literature . At that time he was beginning to write for publication , his previous life having divided itself into separate eras of activ ? ity of about twelve years ' duration . His first twelve years were spent in grow ? ing up . His second twelve years were dedicated to music . He is an accom ? plished and true musician . His next twelve were spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted him with many languages . His years between thirty-six and forty-eight were largely years of specific study and investigation of facts geological , zoological , and archeological , facts which formed a basis for certain erudite pam ? phlets he compiled in later years . These pamphlets are collectors ' items to-day and very scarce , as they were written by a scholar for scholars , and were never in ? tended for a public who likes to take its science in the form of society column notes on the comings and goings of colonies of fish , the private life of whales , or the diseases of minerals . From these pamphlets he wandered into the paths of short-story writing , and so on to the works which have made him famous amongst English speaking and reading peoples , books like Old Calabria , Siren Land , and South Wind . The creating of books occupied a good twelve years from forty-eight to sixty , and will , I trust , continue to occupy his remaining ones May he come to America before they close . His varied accumulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lands and seas , of flesh and blood , untainted by anthropomorphism , his satirical im ? patience with shams and shibboleths , and his steadily maintained scale of values would be salutary weapons to use against us in this , our critical period . His style and simplicity of language in using these weapons through the medium of the written word would be a grateful addition to the literature of our times . What a columnist he would make after a month or two spent in New York ! At the time I met him , twenty years ago , he was in the thick of his geo ? logical investigations and had built a fence around the few remaining trees of Capri to watch them die . He was also making his earliest essays in the field of short stories and had published a short volume of them . The first printed words of Norman Douglas 's I ever saw were " But Alberique had fainted away . " It was the last sentence of a story cut from a bound book and shown me in loose-leaf form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , though I have only the vaguest recollection of its plot ? some ? thing to do with a young man playing a violin to a fascinating lady , or a young lady playing a violin to a fascinating man . From his shyness in showing it to me ( and Douglas is not a shy man , as you may have gathered ) in spite of thefact that I had read neither Plutarch ' s Lives nor learned a column of the dic ? tionary by heart every day , and from the fact that it was singled out from others , I imagine that he cherished it for some personal reason , but that his fine critical judgment had rejected them all . I could stay for years backed up in his fenced-in property and ponder on his writing , but he did come back to get me . With a loud rapping of his cane on the high gate , he called out : " American girl who has n't read Plutarch ' s Lives and who asked me to tea , are you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he turned the key in the lock and let me out , and together we walked back to the Torre Quattro Venti . At the foot of the one hundred and forty-four steps I suggested that it were as well if he did n't accompany me to the door . " No fear , " he answered . " I would n't face those two witches to-night for anything you could offer me ! Mind you learn a column of the dictionary to-night by heart , and to-morrow I 'll come take you for another walk . " Then he waved his cane in the air and walked quickly away . We will draw a curtain over my recep ? tion by the two good ladies . Dear unique Elizabeth Cummings was , I could see , secretly delighted that I had taken matters into my own hands , and only fictitiously stern because she felt it her duty to be , as my moral guardian . Too brilliant and discerning a person not to realize from my defensive description and her own observation of him , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mollified and curious at once , and said , " We 'll ask him to tea to-morrow . " " Could n't we make it dinner or lunch ? " I begged ; " somehow , I do n't think he likes tea . " So it was arranged , and the next day a note was dispatched , but before it could have been received one arrived from him to me . " Dear Mew ( that is all I understood of your name ) , I ca n't come take you for a walk to-day . I must go see Conrad who is here and ill . He has learned his dictionary and has excellent whiskey . I enclose the key to the trees , if you want to go by yourself . Yours ? and Aunt Eliza 's ( which is all I understand of your duemia 's name ) , in Jesus , N. D. " From then on through the months I spent in Capri he was my guide , philoso ? pher , and friend . So he has remained through all the ensuing years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of me . Five of them had elapsed before I saw him again in T , ondon . He was at that time Assistant Editor of the English Review , a periodical that had passed through diverting and illustrious vicissitudes to come at last into the editorial hands of Austin Harrison . When I learned of Douglas 's presence in London I sped him a note as follows : " Dearest Doug : I have married , marrow , Mars , marsala , Marseillaise , marsh , marshal , Marchalsea , marsupial , mart , marten ? , marital , Martin Paul Draper and live at 19 Edith Grove , grovel , grow , growl , growth , groyne , grub , grudge , gruel , gruesome , gruff , grumble , grume , grummet , grumpy , Grundyism , grunt , gruyere , grysbok . Will you come to tea , teach , teague , teak , teal , teamster , teapoy , tear , tearing , tease , teasel , technic at once ( I have got some excellent whiskey ) , and stay to dine , ding-dong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dinothere , dint , diocese , dioptric , dioxide , dip ? Yours , MEW . " He came that afternoon . The same rugged sensitive figure , his voice of an even greater flexibility , eyes more deeply humorous , and hair just beginning to silver at the temples . " Well , Mew , so you 're married and have a son ! Where is be ? Let me see him . If he has been bad to-day I 'll give him a penny , but if he has been good I 'll give him a sound smacking . . . . So this is he , " and he looked down at Paul Jr . standing by me on tip-toe with excite ? ment at this incredibly wicked and an ? archistic grown-up . " Well " ? looking him over with an appraising eye ? " here 's a penny for you . Any day you 've been really bad come to me and I 'll give you another . Never mind your mother . She 's like all American parents , does n't know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the diction ? ary . For God 's sake ! do n't let her fill you up on tea . Run along now and play with some matches , and if you ca n't find any pick all the nice flowers in the win ? dow boxes . There 's a good boy . " When we were alone we sat down and began to talk . We talked through tea , through whiskey , through dinner . Through the night . Italian newspapers , American glaciers , English letters , sexual relations in Sicily , blood relations all over the world , music , Russian Ballet ( then in Paris ) , Russian Emperors , more music , Nietzsche , and back to English letters again . I spoke of a story I bad seen by D. H. Lawrence in the Engli.sh Review , called " Vin Ordinaire . " It was the first short story by Lawrence I had read and I was immensely impressed by its compactness , its emotional tensity , and technical expertness . " A fine talent , D. H. " said Douglas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the really good novels of our time , Sons and Lovers . " Douglas scolded me roundly for my fanatical admiration of Henry James , just for the sake of scolding , for in reality he held him to be a writer of first-rate importance . I pointed out that he knew all there was to blow of American par ? ents , which in itself should have endeared him to Douglas . When they met in my house , as they occasionally did , the con ? versation between them was of the most desultory character . They were too fun ? damentally divergent in their approach to life and too diametrically opposed in matters of style and technic even to bring about conflict between them , to say nothing of agreement . After the salutary lecture he administered on the dangers of becoming hypnotized by the sheer pleasure of process to be derived from H. J. , Douglas at last let me talk to him about himself and his own writings , by then become a structure immeasur ? ably distant from " But Alberique had fainted away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I made him listen until dawn . As the light began to cloud the clear blackness of the sky through the glass over our heads , he rose from the depths of one of the big armchairs and said , " Ah , well , my dear Mew , it 's perfectly clear that I am the only person left alive who can write the English language and you the only person who can appreciate it . Run along to bed now , and mind you start that boy of yours off in the morning with a really sound thrashing . He has been damned quiet to-night . " This was the first of many nights of cherished discussions . Startlingly dis ? respectful was Douglas of anything but the best . Exceptional powers of de ? structive criticism , Spartan standards of intellectual discipline , and Babylonian standards of moral tolerance made his conversation stimulating and enlighten ? ing beyond that of most men I have known . Humor that ran the whole gamut from the subtlest shades possible to be conveyed by a pause to the most solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English language . Particularly adroit was he in the use of good old Anglo-Saxon words of one syllable . Servants were in a state of shocked adoration , even the two imperturbable English maids finding it at moments difficult to serve him in perfect solem ? nity . As for the Irish angel who flew out of a convent to take care of my son , she would snatch Paul Jr . into the safety to be found behind a locked nursery door , crossing herself as she flew upstairs with him the minute Douglas entered the house . But she would come down in an amazingly short time again , on some perfectly needless errand or other , and hover about the premises , her face scarlet with embarrassed delight and murmuring , " Glory be to God , madame , he 's terrible . " This would bring a chuckle from Douglas that was the most satisfactory sound one could hear . I did not tell you about that chuckle ? It was fo ? cussed in his throat , drawing into itself all the reinforcement that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inccmparably complex mechanism known as the human body . His eyes would send gleams of merriment through nearly closed eyelids that became tears as they reached his throat . Ears would send the echo of every thing they had heard in life to add color to the solid gurgling bulk of sound that centered there . Quivering nostrils sent shafts of shivering light that played on it . The throat itself became a cylindrical con ? tainer to hold this phenomenon . Hands offered memories of tactile experience that touched it into constantly changing shapes . Lungs bellowed to keep it inflated with the breath to live and a heart pumped it full of blood . Legs that had climbed mountains and wan ? dered in valleys gave it rhythm . Such was his chuckle . In need of its refreshment after a lapse of ten years , I crossed the ocean to hear it not so long ago . As it rang through a narrow Florentine street in which , at the entrance of one of the few civilized restaurants that city boasts , Douglas stood awaiting me , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brave living and a fearless scrutiny of death . Standing in an English country lane , I have heard bells ringing out and up to a star-filled sky from a church tower of stone that have not done as much . I tried to tell him so , as I clung to those rugged sensitive shoulders in the glad excitement of seeing him again , but in rather pleased embarrassment he checked me . " Come along now , Mew . A little food is what you need . Do n't stand here laughing and crying in the street this way , for God 's sake ? talking about bells ! The whole damned populace of Florence will collect around us if you do n't take care . They 'll think I have seduced you and am now trying to abandon you . I ca n't be bothered at this late date to suffer for a whole new reputation . I 've enough to keep me busy as it is . " He chuckled . " Yes , I know , we 've all had our bit of Hell these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good girl . The aspect changes with a little red wine ! " And he pulled me down the two or three steps that led into the restaurant from the sidewalk . The aspect did change with a little red wine and the excellent food that by dint of his threats , maledictions , judicious indiscretions , and visits to the kitchen , was finally put before us . He ate and listened in wise patience while my words tumbled over themselves in their en ? deavor to convey something to him of the events that had taken place in the world and my life since last seeing him . He commented on one occasion with an " Ah , yes , those two sons . I hope they are behaving badly . What hope is there for them otherwise , born of American parents ? I suppose you are giving them a ' modern education . ' God help them ! They should be taught Latin , Greek , and as much natural science as they are capable of demonstrating ? thrashed if they do n't learn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are subjected to psychological tests and sex-charts , poor devils , and believe by now that George Washington and William James did more for civilization than Copernicus and Aristotle . Well , it 's too late now . They never see a dictionary , I suppose ? " Murmuring some feeble protest , I questioned him about his own sons . " Do n't know much about them , really . Archie , the eldest , is married , I believe , or about to be . Writes stories ? sent me some the other day . I do n't know what they are about , do n't understand the new generation . He asked for criti ? cism , but I had none to make . Not my game , you know ? do n't understand ' em , " he answered , with a chuckle that began in derision and ended in pride . A slender neutral-looking man came up to our table , hovered over it in a slightly drunken sway and , peering out from frightened , old , big , half-shut eyes , asked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you drinking , Douglas , and whom are you drinking it with ? " " Sit down with us and find out , " Douglas replied and , turning to me , he said , " Mew , this is Scott Moncrieff , who is translating your friend Marcel Proust . " " But Douglas ! " I exclaimed , " he was not my friend . Would to God he was , but I never even saw him . " well , you admire him , I 'm sure . Just the kind of stuff you would read , you know . I can just hear you discuss him . You know how you used to go on about Henry Ja ? " " Now Douglas , be a lamb , and do n't scold me about that . Do let me greet Mr. Moncrieff . Let 's all have some more red wine . " " Good idea , " mumbled Scott Mon ? crieff and , having stood uncomfortably by us during this colloquy , he sat down with considerable relief . He was so knotted in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held his voice half closed , as well as his eyes ; and when I began to tell him of my admiration for his translation of Marcel Proust , he closed his mind , too . In an almost un ? intelligible tangle of words , he plunged into a lengthy dissertation on what seemed to be the obscure technicalities practiced by ancient Scottish lawyers . He retreated into a Scotch mist of remote erudition and , when I tried to follow him , appeared suddenly just above me on some lowly hilltop . It became too tedious to interpret as fantasy , and finally , impatient , I called a halt : " Stop this cumbersome intellectual coquetry . I am telling you that I think you have done a swell job translating a damned difficult book . If you do n't want to unknot yourself and talk about it , drink some more red wine , and keep still , but do n't flirt a conversational fan before the face of your mind . I ca n't keep on expressing admiration all night , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , and ? drank some more red wine . Doug ? las was delighted . I was out of breath . We all drank some more wine . A young English boy , a painter of sorts , came up to the table and carried off the by now friendly but utterly silent Scott Moncrieff . Douglas and I sat on , discussing hus ? bands , wives , children , education , writ ? ing , fighting , and ? well , yes , we dis ? cussed that too , but I wo n't write that down here . Very sound , Douglas , about such things , though you might not think it . I asked for news of his wife . It had been clear to me , from the first mention of her in the early Capri days , that he had loved her deeply during the two years he had " followed her about all over the place , " as he put it , and that the first years of marriage had not been unhappy ; it was equally clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dered a resentment as deep , which time had not abated . Her whereabouts and life were subjects I seldom broached , but after ten years I ventured this inquiry . Douglas 's eyes flamed for a second , his lips smiled into ashes , and he said , " Burned to death in a hotel some ? where in Germany . . . . " So we drank some more wine . The next day we met for lunch at what Douglas called the " other good restaurant , " Scott Moncrieff and the English painter boy joining us . We drank white wine this time . Douglas reduced the good proprietor to tears by telling him the wine was a combination of orris-root and dead violets . I did not drink much of it . He had asked me to come to his apartment that afternoon and read twenty-odd chapters of a book he had begun some two years before and had been unable to finish . " Stale , you know , one gets sometimes ? stale . Ca n't seem to finish it . Going off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps that will help , or perhaps I ca n't write any more . The twelve years are up , you know . I 'm sixty . Have a look at it . Perhaps it 's a rotten book . I do n't know ? stale . " I was glad the white wine was none too good , else we should have sat hours at table , and I was eager to see that book . We left the task of soothing the outraged proprietor to Moncrieff , and walked away through the town , over a bridge , down an alley , and up the dark stone staircase to N. D. 's apartment . I clamored for the manuscript as soon as I crossed the threshold , but he became obstinately shy and wanted to show me the apartment . The nervous appre ? hension he felt concerning this particular manuscript was doubtless due to the twelve-year myth he had built up about his life , and the fatigue of sixty arduous years of living . In any case , I had to inspect the pleasant sun-filled living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny cell-like bedroom , the archaic kitchen , and the bathroom which he had bullied the Florentine plumber into accomplishing . It was good to find him installed in a certain degree of comfort , for I had known him when he was living under conditions that had imposed a sparsity and austerity scrupu ? lously complied with . When I com ? mented on this , concluding that South Wind had brought it about , in part at least , he scoffed : " South Wind , indeed ! Do you know what I got for that ? Seventy-five pounds . I sold the book outright ? too hard up to make terms . Never received another penny for it . Have n't made five hundred pounds by this damned writing you talk so much about since I first began it . Here , look here , " and he opened a large account book on his desk , " look at this ! Just forty-three pounds in the last year , that 's what my stuff has brought me ! South Wind ! " he snorted . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes friends are kind , you know , just as sometimes God is not stupid . Go sit down over there and I 'll bring you this book you are so anxious to see . Much better have another look at the bathroom . It is a good piece of work , you know . " Finally the typewritten pages were in my hands . Douglas made a pretense of sitting at his desk to busy himself with letters and papers ; but he rose at short intervals and walked about the room , keeping me well within sight as I read . devoured the words . The work is a masterpiece . It is a history of the world as only Douglas could conceive it . He has invented a my ? thology of his own . Gods and god ? desses adorn an imagined structure of Creation that bids fair , as all feats of real imagination should , to become an interpretation of fact a thousand years from now . Knowledge , satire , and wis ? dom are in the building of this structure , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are illuminating . And through it runs some of the finest lyric prose that he is capable of . The whole work flowers from his rich matu ? ray and combines the essentials of his manifold gifts . Or so it was the day I read it . I told him so in no uncertain words , and for once he did not chide me for my frenzied exuberance . I threat ? ened to remain in Florence until it was finished , but , alas ! American parents are American parents , and sons -- -whether receiving an education ancient or modern ? have a way of being missed . I came home . At the time of my departure not another word had been added to the book , but I had extracted a promise from Douglas that it would be finished before another twelve years elapsed . In a recent letter he writes modestly of a book he is sending me , " part of which you have read . " So he has kept his promise .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
