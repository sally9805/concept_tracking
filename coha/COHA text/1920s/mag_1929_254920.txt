Thomas Alva Edison in a fringed muffler , Mrs. Edison , four servants , a dozen laboratory assistants and five carloads of laboratory gear &; raw materials , all rolled southward last week from New Jersey toward Fort Myers , Fla . Through the press rolled headlines . For Inventor Edison , having celebrated the golden jubilee of his electric light bulb , had signalized his annual winter hegira by an announcement that sounded fraught with gold . <P> Packed in his five carloads of laboratory material were tons of stalks of a common , ubiquitous weed : goldenrod . Goldenrod , announced Inventor Edison , seemed a likely U. S. weed from which to produce the object of his major research in the past two years : Rubber. * <P> Chief Laboratory Assistant Frederick Ott is the sturdy mechanician who for 43 years has supervised experiments on Inventor Edison 's ideas . The man who has for 19 years tried to keep the ideas from public garbling is a precise , British-born lawyer named William Henry Meadowcroft , 76 . Last week Secretary Meadowcroft was exasperated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present low price of real rubber , as the price of golden-rod rubber. + Neither Inventor Edison nor anyone in his organization could guess yet at manufacturing costs or how many acres of goldenrod would produce a ton of rubber . <P> The extensibility of rubber is usually confused with its elasticity . Rubber is one of the most inelastic of substances . An absolutely elastic substance is one which returns to its original size and shape after stretching . Rubber does not do that . Pull a piece of rubber , release it , measure it . It is deformed . Old rubbers are bigger than new ones . Steel is far more elastic than rubber , but of course much less stretchable . Glass is probably more elastic than steel . Quartz is an almost perfect elastic . Hence its use in nice measuring instruments such as telescopes . <P> The inelasticity of rubber is useful-in motor car tires , bumpers , airplane shock absorber cords-because it absorbs considerable of the energy which stretches it and transforms that absorbed energy into heat . That is why a continually flexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a rubber band between closed lips . The lips can feel the heat . Pull ( not slide ) a piece of steel similarly ( a machine is necessary ) , the steel will cool off . <P> Rubber is a complex hydrocarbon . Fundamental in its composition is isoprene . The organic chemist can make isoprene from such common stuffs as turpentine , petroleum , starch , coal tar or acetylene . News of goldenrod as a likely rubber source gave the casual daily press opportunity to picture farmers sneezing as they harvested the autumn-gorgeous weed . But goldenrod pollen is one of the lesser causes of hayfever . Ragweed , more widespread , is the chief cause in the U. S. <P> *There may be other rubber weeds . Mr. Edison has found traces of rubber in 1,200 U. S. plants , of 16,000 he has examined . <P> +Cheapest ( English ) artificial rubber , made from hydrocarbons , costs 75 per Ib.
