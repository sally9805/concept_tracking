THE CABINET <P> A diplomat and his wife ( be they from Siam or Switzerland ) found Washington a handshaking city on New Year 's Day . Having celebrated the end of 1926 according to their tastes , they arose at 9:45 a.m. , snatched a cup of coffee and hurried to the White House to be in line for the President and Mrs. Coolidge at 11 . Then they went to the lavish Pan-American Building to have a diplomatic buffet breakfast with the Secretary of State and Mrs. Kellogg . As they smoked Mr. Kellogg 's cigarets and watched the Aztec fountain play , they exchanged many a felicitation . Most of Washington 's bigwigs and their ladies were there-Cabinet members , ambassadors , ministers , Supreme Court justices , Congressmen , Army and Navy officers . <P> That afternoon , had the diplomat and his wife been extremely agile , they could have called on seven other Cabinet members who were holding receptions in keeping with the annual custom . Only Attorney General Sargent , whose wife had gone home to frosty Vermont , and Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not serve tea . Secretary of the Treasury Mellon , with his son Paul , received at his apartment on Massachusetts Avenue . <P> If the diplomat had drawn any conclusion from his social tour , it would be that the present Cabinet is a steady one . None of its members seem likely to resign at present. * <P> Secretaries Mellon , Hoover and James J.

" Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jolly fraternal manner , " only do n't forget that I was born in Wales . " <P> Leaving the convention , Mr. Davis stopped at Pittsburgh to visit his parents , to tell them how he almost became a candidate for Vice President . With a lump in her throat , Mother Davis said to Father Davis : " David , if you had only been willing to come to America when I wanted you to , we would have had a Vice President in the family . " <P> Mr. Davis* was born in a mill-town called Tredegar , 53 years ago-the son and grandson of stout iron workers . One day , when he was eight , his mother dragged him out from under his bed by the heels . He tried to grip the floor and got splinters in his hands , but he was taken off to the land of liberty by his family , who believed : " The American mind is right . Go to America . " <P> And so , in western Pennsylvania son James J. , aged eleven , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was admitted to the union and soon was a master puddler . Many years later , when he had become Secretary of Labor , when he was reputedly worth a million dollars , Mr. Davis published an autobiography , The Iron Puddler , in which he told of the glamor of his onetime art :
