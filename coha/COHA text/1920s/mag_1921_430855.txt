" DO N'T go to Ireland unless you want to be shot by the Black and Tans or ambushed and assassinated by the Sinn Fein , " was the advice given me by officials and friends when I started from London to Erin . But I went to Ireland solely as a spectator , and I felt that as long as I maintained that attitude I was safe . My first difficulty was to gain admission into Dublin Castle , which today is the headquarters of the British Army . After a wait of several days , and much red tape , I was finally ushered into the presence of Colonel Wilson , chief of the Intelligence Department . He apologized to me for keeping his hands in his pockets while talking , and explained that his hands were on his automatic pistols as a measure of precaution . Both of his predecessors had been shot down , and as he was a man of family he did not want to take any more chances than were necessary . Ten days later he was killed , in broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , to make my own neutrality doubly sure , I called on Mr. Arthur Griffith , acting President of the Irish Republic , explained to him the purpose of my visit , and asked him to give me Sinn Fein credentials so that I might travel about at will . There was no hesitancy on his part in providing me with the necessary letter , and then , fully armed with my cameras , I was ready for my journey . CONDITIONS IN DUBLIN I was amazed to find Dublin apparently calm and peaceful . It was only after several days that I began to sense the feeling of tenseness , the extreme nervousness of the people . One day I was walking through the streets of the Irish capital when , like a bolt from a blue sky , a shot rang out . People , running from all directions , began to gather , and before I fairly realized that something had happened , motor-lorries filled with troops appeared on the scene . Machine-guns were turned on the crowd ,  | volleys of rifle shots were poured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many dropped , some killed and a number wounded . Finally , the streets were cleared , order was restored , the people returned to their homes , the troops to their quarters , and the riot ended as suddenly as it began . These are the un-looked-for things that happen at the most unexpected times and in places where one might think that such an occurrence was impossible . Conditions generally are chaotic . Dublin Castle is today an armed fort , closely guarded , day and night , by a strong cordon of troops , while around its walls are barbed wire entanglements . At the entrance to the Bank of Ireland armed sentries pace to and fro . All mail is sent through the streets accompanied by a strong guard , the soldiers wearing steel helmets just as they did at the front . At night the streets of the city are patrolled by troops and armored cars . Dublin has a curfew law , and anyone found upon the streets after midnight , unless provided with a military pass , is arrested . Conditions in the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fermoy and Cork , now under martial law , nine o'clock at night was the dead line when I was there ? after that hour the inhabitants were required to be in their homes or suffer imprisonment . Where these laws are in effect , a challenge to halt must be instantly obeyed , as the soldiers are instructed to shoot anyone that disregards orders . LOOTING AND BURNING Every police station in Ireland is today a fort . In place of glass in the windows there is sheet steel with loopholes for rifles . The entrance is protected by barbed wire and all the police , in addition to their revolvers , are armed with rifles . More than five hundred police-barracks have been burned to the ground and the stations have time and again been subjected to attacks . Terror is added to the unsettled conditions by the numerous conflagrations which have destroyed many homes and millions of dollars ' worth  | of property . In Cork , the best part of the business district has been wiped out by incendiary fires ; enormous damage has also been inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places . While much of the damage may be attributed to the action of the mob , considerable looting , sacking and burning has been done in reprisal for outrages committed . Recently the Honorable Under-Secretary for Ireland , in the House of Commons , justified reprisals taken by troops upon inhabitants of villages where outrages were committed . Such a contention brings up the question whether two wrongs can make a right . Criwe can not be condoned , of course , but whether the innocent should suffer for the guilty is another matter . There may be justification for dire punishment of the perpetrators of some of the dastardly murders that have been committed in Ireland , but because a soldier is killed from ambush , should the entire population of a village be punished ? Many of the best English journals have condemned reprisals of this kind , and between contradiction , denial and condemnation , the question is still in abeyance . In such cities as Londonderry and Belfast , I saw sand bag barricades erected by the soldiers , in the principal business thoroughfares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire into riotous crowds that fought for days . Hospitals were filled with the wounded , business was practically suspended for days , and when order was finally restored , the ugly scars told mutely the story of  | depredations . Wrecked shops , looted stores , burned buildings , all testified to the reign of terror that is shaking the country to its very foundations . PROSPEROUS FARMERS In striking contrast to the turmoil in the congested centers , the Irish farmer lives in peace and quiet . He has never been more prosperous , his vegetables bring three and four times as much as in pre-war years , and for little pigs , four and five English pounds each is an average price . As a result , the shack has given way to pretty little thatchedroof cottages , which , today , like sunspots , dot the landscape . These flower-encircled homes are an evidence of a new era in the life of the Irish farmer . Where formerly the cart was the favorite vehicle of the peasant , ? the motive power a donkey , last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry . " So great is the demand for Ford cars that an assembling plant has been built near Cork . The rollicking good nature of the Irish farmer , his wit and hospitality , is what endears Ireland to the visitor . Eager at all times to extend a hearty welcome to the guest from the United States , it is seldom that one enters a cottage without finding someone who has either a brother or a relative , who is an alderman , mayor or congressman in some city in the United States . The Irishman is thoroughly familiar with our country ; next to Erin , which to him is " just a little bit of Paradise , " he loves America better than any other place . SCENIC BEAUTY As a relief from the shocking scenes of riot , murder and destruction , in the cities , one turns gladly to the lovely romantic spots in the country .  | Such scenic gems as the Lakes of Killarney , the River Shannon , Ballybunnion , the Giant 's Causeway and the Golden Vale of Tipperary have few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with velvety green , clothes the ruins with ivy and adorns the country with a floral mantle . Blending romance with legend and fairy tale , the people of Ireland associate with all of their beauty spots fantastic stories of colleens , giants and tales of the O'Donoghue . These lend added interest to places made beautiful by the bounty of nature . In visiting Ireland today , it is well to turn one 's face away for a time from the tragic drama of the city streets and dwell on some of the more pleasing things to be seen . One of the most recent and important industries in Ireland is the co-operative creamery , which is springing up in every part of the country . This , the result of the life-work of Sir Horace Plunkett , has been a boon to the Irish farmer . Wherever a creamery has been built , the farmers for miles around come every day with their little carts to have the cream separated from the milk . The farmer pays a percentage of the cream obtained for the process of separation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place , as reprisal for outrages committed . More than fifty creameries have been burned and enormous damage has been inflicted upon the farmers , most of whom are admittedly innocent of wrong-doing ; they are being made to suffer because of the acts of others .  | SOME IRISH INDUSTRIES Famous for its lace , some of which is as delicate as the web woven by a spider , Ireland confines this industry to the convents , where the Sisters teach orphan girls how to use a needle . So deft have they become that Irish lace is eagerly sought by lovers of delicate handiwork the world over . Lace began to be a real Irish industry in 1829 and 1830 , and the first active lace centers were Limerick and Carrickmacross . County Cork is famous for needlepoint in the style of the seventeenth century . This particular Irish Point Lace industry has an interesting story , which I give in full : " In 1847 , when famine was raging in Ireland and the English Government refused to help the starving peo- ple , a nun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way by which she could alleviate the awful misery of the poor people . She had in her possession a piece of foreign lace made in Italy . Slowly and carefully she picked out the stitches to learn the process by which the lace was made . She then tried to remake the lace and found to her great joy that she could reproduce it exactly . She immediately taught it to a number of young girls , who soon became very proficient . With these girls the good nun formed a regular school of lace-making . The money earned was a great boon to the starving people . The school continued to prosper and to this day turns out exquisite lace . "  | In recent years Irish horses have captured the great races run in England and France . Last year the Grand Prix in Paris and the Derby in England were won by Irish-bred horses . At Curragh on the farm of Mr. Parkinson , the well - known horse-trainer , is Bellsize , an unbeaten two-year-old , valued at one hundred thousand dollars . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rajah of Cashmir , purchased for five hundred dollars , now valued at forty thousand dollars . The breeding and training of horses is one of the important Irish industries . Bogfields are found in every part of Ireland . They are purchased just as are farms . The turf in the boglands is cut into brick-shaped blocks by a sort of spade called a " slane . " Then these blocks are stacked in piles and dried by the sun . The turf is known as " peat " and is burned as fuel . It is sometimes referred to as " Irish coal . " Gathering and selling it is an important business . COMMERCIAL CENTERS A tour through Ireland takes one to a number of big , busy commercial cities and towns . Limerick , on the river Shannon , is not only a most picturesque old town , but is an active commercial center , celebrated for its bacon , famous for its lace , and noted for its pretty women . Limerick has historic interest as the scene of the famous ? or infamous ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this number ; the stone , now known as " the stone of the broken  | treaty , " is set up as a historic monument on the bridge at Limerick . While the greatest industries , such as shipbuilding and linen , are in the north of Ireland , the richest agricultural district is in the south . Commercially , Belfast is the metropolis of the island ; its wealth is far greater than that of any other city . It is essentially a business city , while the capital , Dublin , retains the distinction of being the most beautiful city of Ireland . Ther ( is great rivalry between the nortt and the south . To understand conditions and know Ireland one must be familiar with the fact that the south is Irish to the core , while in the north , or in the so - called Ulster Counties , there are many Scots . RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS Differences in religious belief has divided the country as much if not more than any other factor . Most of the Orangemen , or Protestants , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely Roman Catholic . The stronghold of the Sinn Fein movement is in the south , while most of those opposed to Home Rule live in the north . Sinn Fein , translated from Gaelic into English , means " we ourselves , " or , in other words , a Sinn Feiner ( pronounced as if spelled Shin Faner ) is one who believes in Ireland for the Irish , and is naturally a Home Ruler .  | It is not a new problem that confronts the Irish . For centuries they have been struggling for freedom . As to the measure and extent of that freedom there are varying degrees of opinion and conviction today . Some want a Republic of their own ; others would be content with an autonomous Government . There must be some way out of the deplorable state of affairs in which Ireland now finds itself . Surely there is some compromise possible which will effectually do away with the needless sacrifice of human life and property on the smiling Isle of Erin . Too long has murder and reprisal gone on in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ireland with an open mind , with no other purpose than to report conditions as I actually found them . I photographed what I saw ? and much of what I saw was shocking and deplorable . It is a pitiful thing to see men so wrought up that , literally speaking , their hands are on their guns all the time . The slightest provocation furnishes an excuse for murder and arson . Never in all my experience have I seen men so roused to anger as those fighting in the streets of Belfast . Wire entanglements were to be met at points on the main streets , and machine gun corps crouched in protected cor- ners . There was an appearance of a besieged city in many quarters . Not even the machine-guns and rifles of the troops , however , were sufficient to quell the rioters , who surged through the streets of the city for four long days and nights . Many were killed , hundreds wounded , millions of dollars ' worth of property destroyed . VVhal maddens many of the people is the engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound-a-day men " ? hard characters of all kinth serving as hireling soldiers , and pursuing a policy of frightfulness on them . How long are these things to continue ; what prospect is there of peace and order ? The British Government says it is desirous of terminating the Irish question in a manner satisfactory to all concerned . On the other hand the Sinn Feiners claim they are eager for a just settlement . With that avowed desire on both sides , a solution of the problem ought , surely , to be possible . Between the lines there must be a common ground , where settlement can be made , once and for all time , of a quarrel that has lasted for seven hundred years , at a terrific sacrifice , both to England and to Erin . Of one thing I am sure ? Americans , always sympathetic , will rejoice when the " Irish problem " is no more .  |
