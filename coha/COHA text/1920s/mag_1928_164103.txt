No Rhodes scholar is to be trusted in the editorial department of a U.S. newspaper , for his association with Englishmen may be presumed to have made him an unpatriotic propagandist . In education he is even more dangerous , for the young people of the U. S. are an impressionable lot . He might be given a business job if concern had no foreign trade and never touched a foreign bond . If he should become a laborer , he might poison union minds with European socialism . As a scientist he would have to be watched , for there is no telling what dastardly machines he might sell to the enemies of the U. S. Even as a barber , his chatting to customers might lead to the fermenting of the un-American ideas . What , then , can a Rhodes Scholar do when he returns to the U. S. after three years at Oxford ? Practically nothing-if the words of Congressman Fred Albert Britten of Illinois and the editorials of William Randolph Hearst 's newspapers are carried to a logical conclusion . <P> Congressman Britten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , and said : " Run down the newspapers who oppose this legislation for the benefit of the U. S. Navy , look into their editorial departments and you will find Rhodes scholarship men , British subjects , propagandists and pacifists controlling them . " Mr. Britten particularly mentioned the New York Times , New York World , Baltimore Sun . <P> Last week Mr. Hearst 's Washington Herald seized Mr. Britten 's speech with a cry of joy , and spread the Rhodes Scholarship paragraph in extra big and extra black type as a text for an editorial which covered the entire top-half of a page . <P> But Mr. Hearst himself has been accused of using his papers to exert improper influence upon the foreign relations of the U. S. In February , President Coolidge made a speech criticizing but not naming certain newspapers . The speech was taken to be a rebuke to Mr. Hearst for having published fake Mexican " documents . " ' Last week the Hearst editorial had the effrontery to link that same Coolidge speech with Britten Anglophobia , implying that both were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Baltimore Sun .
