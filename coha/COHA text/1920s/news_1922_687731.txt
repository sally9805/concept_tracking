txt Those of us who do.not believe in taking money out of the taxpayer 's pocket to buy reelection for about the most mediocre bunch of Senators and Congressmen we " lave had in Congress for a generation , will note , with reassurance , that bonus discussion at - the Capitol is at present suspended . There is one superiority to the business man which the politician always claims . This is that he is in closer touch with public opinion . It need hardly be said that he values the moralist as little as the business man . He has told both that the " people " want a soldiers ' bonus . Under our electoral system it takes time to discover what people really want . But the primary elections show , in the most emphatic manner , that the " people " will have none of the bonus . Quite apart from the nomination of Gifford Pinchot for Governor of Pennsylvania . where only state issues were raised , the renomination of Senator Pepper , who can conceive , as he says , no worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among young , healthy , ablebodied , and , presumably , self-respecting men , merely because they discharged the duties of citizens of their age . is an impressive demonstration of the popular will . But one nomination does not settle the question . It is probable that a large number of Congressmen and some Senators , swept into office on the Harding wave of 1920 , will not be reelected in any case , even if they are renominated . But they must be renominated by their party if they are to run . On the party decisions at the primaries , therefore , Congressmen William J. Burke , Anderson H. Walters , George P. Darrow . Charles R. Connell , Benjamin M. Focat . Evan J. Jones , all of Pennsylvania , and Ira C. Copley and Clifford Ireland of Illinois , all voters for the bonus , have not persuaded even their own party to reemploy them . Having to pay the bill the " people , " not surprisingly , regard the bonus bribe as a liability and not an asset . Not claiming any great superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politician . as an interpreter of public opinion , is usually wrong , or right for the- wrong reason . His method is simplicity itself . He tries to formulate what the mob is shouting . Sometimes he gives the mob a cry which crystallizes a thought and is , forthwith , elected leader . Anything will do which is. as the advertising experts say , short and snappy . " Sixteen to one , " " he kept us out of the war , " " down with the interests , " " five-cent fare " ? it does not matter so long as the mob can be persuaded to think it is getting something it wants . Of course we have an occasional statesman who shows the real people not what they want but what they need . None of these , at least , should fail of renomination , ur even of reelection , for condemning the soldiers ' bonus . Too much religion in politics may be as bad as none , but perhaps the repatriated Irish want to strike an average .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
