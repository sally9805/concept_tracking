People digging cellars and plowing fields in France and Belgium turned up , last year , the remains of 3,361 British soldiers . Edward of Wales as Honorary President of the Imperial War Graves Commission saw to it that these heroes , long since given up for lost , were reverently interred in eleven British cemeteries . Last week the I. W. G. C. , tireless , diligent and unsung , published its ninth annual report , a monument to the labors of its Permanent Vice-chairman , Major General Sir Fabian Ware . <P> Presented with a list of 1,081,952 lost soldiers in 1919 , the Commission has done so well that today the whereabouts of all but 326,256 are known . Corpses " identified and buried " total 582,783 , while only 173,213 have had to be interred as " unknown soldiers . " Especially tasteful has been the advice of Artistic Adviser Sir Frederic Kenyon , in collaboration with seven Principal Architects , five of whom are knights.                   @ @
