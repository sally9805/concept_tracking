Those who profess to believe that the Balkan pot is about to boil over into active warfare were not surprised last week when the Chicago Herald-Examiner ( Hearst ) printed , exclusively , excerpts from " secret instructions sent from Kemals Mustapha Kemal Pasha , dictator of Turkey foreign office to the Turkish minister at Belgrade . " This document was " intercepted by a secret agent of one of the Balkan powers . " In it , Dictator Kemal outlines his country 's moves in the event of a Balkan conflict , as follows : <P> " In the coming dispute between Italy and Serbia Jugoslavia , outwardly we have no set policy , sympathy or antipathy toward either one of the disputants , nor to the subject of the dispute-Albania . " We have no allies outside of Russia who definitely have undertaken to come to our defense should the fatherland be invaded . In turn , we shall go to Russia 's assistance should that country 's territorial integrity be menaced by more than one power . . . . <P> " It is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to England , France and Germany-to force them to actively interest themselves in the settlement of her dispute with Serbia . <P> " You will regard the negotiations with Serbia as a camouflage behind which Italy is planning a sudden descent on our shores . . . . <P> " It is also our conviction that a war between Italy and Serbia , if Bulgaria and Rumania can be prevented from attacking Serbia , will be a short one . The Serbs are good fighters , and , fighting in their own territory , will administer a stinging defeat to the Italian armies . Italy will not be able to deploy great forces to fight Serbia . . . . <P> " In the event of Bulgaria attacking Serbia , if found advisable , jointly by Russia and the Turkish republic , we shall attack Bulgaria . A defeated and humiliated Serbia would open a highway to the exuberant Italian armies to march across Bulgaria to our frontiers . That we shall never countenance . <P> " Should Rumania attack Serbia during the presumed war between Serbia and Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps march to <P> Bucharest . In that eventuality we shall hold in readiness an army of perhaps 100,000 men at the Bulgarian frontier and deploy it to the advantage of our northern ally ( Russia ) . . . . "
