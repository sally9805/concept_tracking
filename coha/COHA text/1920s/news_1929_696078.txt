txt Numerous mergers that have been arranged in the past few months naturally have given rise to a crop of reports of other combinations soon to be effected . There is also considerable speculation as to the significance of the present combinations and the possibilities of future developments along this line in the local banking field . While consolidation of National City Bank and Farmers Loan &; Trust Co. establishes the former , unequivocally , as the premier bank of the country , and for the time being at least removes the race for supremacy recently brought to the fore by the merger of Guaranty Trust Co. and National Bank of Commerce . it can not be said that the banking line up at this center has become stabilized by the combinations that have so far been formulated . On the contrary there is reason to expect continued developments along this line and new associations of banking capital and facilities in the next few months . Recent events not only have borne out expectationi but have suggested new and greater possibilities . For instance , the unique arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its organization by retaining Farmers Loan &; Trust as a separate corporate entity to manage trust affairs exclusively , opens up a great field . With the extensive ramifications of City Bank and City Co. organization , it is easy to visualize the possibilities of this new opportunity The banking , investment , and trust departments of the bank will he able to cooperate in the building up of a financial organization never before thought possible . A Bank of the People While forging ahead as the leading American bank in point of size and deposits , the National City Bank in the past ten years has blazed the way with several new and original departures in the field of banking . In building up its capital strength , the management has not fixed its eyes merely on " big business " It has sought to make the City Bank at the same time a bank of the people . This is shown in its branch banking activities at home and abroad , its compound interest and its industrial small loan departments . It . has made special efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the par value to $20 was in furtherance of the idea to popularize the institution . Thereis reason to believe that the National City Bank has other novel plans of expansion for the futu . Recent mergers in local banking circles have indicated that the impelling force has not been size so much as the creation of more complete units . The tendency has been to bring together institutions rather dissimilar in their functions which would result in a bank with well rounded out facilities . This was seen in the merger of the International Acceptance Bank with the Bank of the Manhattan Co. , National Bank of Commerce with Guaranty Trust Co . U. S. Mortgage &; Trust Co. with Chemical National Bank , Blair &; Co. with Bank of America . and Hanover National Bank with Central Union Trust Co . To a large extent the absnrned institution in these cases brought into the combination a line of business which the absorbing bank stood in need of . It is on this score that expectations are entertained that further amalgamations may be witnessed in the local banking field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and novel combination that has taken place lately . and one which holds forth the greatest possibilities . is that of an issuing house uniting with a bank . The marger of Blair Sr Co with Bank of America for example occasioned considerable interest . Because of Blair &; Co. ' s close association heretofore with the Chase Securities Corp. , it has been said that this operation eventually would lead to a merger of Bank ca : America with Chase National Bank . This step , however , is not believed to be contemplated . It is known that a move to merge these banks was at one time under way but was subsequently abandoned in favor of the Blair &; Co. absorption . Accorting to terms of the merger . Blair &; Co. will be merged into Bankanneric Corp. , the security affiliate of Bank of America , securing 363.637 shares of the bank shortly to be issued in addition to the 1,000,000 shares outstanding , of which Transamerica Corp . and Bankitaly Co. of America own over 670.000 shares . Blair &; Co therefore , by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp. , which is controlled by the Giannini interests . Any possible merger between Chase and Bank of America would still be wholly a matter of consideration between the controlling factors in these two organizations . Blair &; Co . Acquisition Advantages Officials of Bank of America and Transamerica regard the Blair &; Co. acquisition . with that firm 's experience in the issuing of securities , as of considerable advantage in building up the security and investment departments of the bank . The bank will , of course , get additional business as registrar and transfer agent in issues to be brought out by the new organization . There have been interesting reports that other combinations along this line are under way . A persistent story is to the effect that Dillon Read &; Co. may go in with Bank of the Manhattan Co. to form a security affiliate . Acatttsition of International Acceptance Bank beet/gist to Manhattan Co. a strong Paul M. Warburg representation . There is already a coramturity of interest between Dillon Read &; Co. and the Warburg affiliations . Recently the former bought 10,000 shares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National American Corp . and is since reported to be buying additional stock in the market . The names of several other banks and trust companies have been mentioned frequently in connection wan merger reports . Among those nstitutions said to be figuring in some icirabination in the near future are Irving Trust Do. , Seaboard National Bank , Equitable Trust . National Park , Brooklyn Trust Co .. Manufacturers Trust . and Public National Bank . It is also said that merger of First National Bank and of Bankers Trust Co is being talked about by the " powers that be " in the two organizations .
