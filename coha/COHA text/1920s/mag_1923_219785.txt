With Scornful Eye and Harpy Tongue , Senator Pettigrew Views With Alarm* <P> Richard Franklin Pettigrew , of Sioux Falls , was elected to the United States Senate in 1889 . He remained there until 1902 when Mark Hanna " raised a vast sum of money to corrupt the voters of South Dakota . " <P> Now he has published his memoirs. * Expressed in simplest terms and in Mr. Pettigrew 's own phrase , the volume aims to suggest that " politicians serve the business interests first and the public afterwards . " ( Mr. Pettigrew is ostensibly Socialist-though he started Republican and in 1896 became Populist-Democrat . ) <P> For those who like to take their vitriol straight the following excerpts are printed : Of the Federal Constitution . " The Convention of 1787 that framed the Constitution of the United States was dominated by lawyers , moneylenders and land owners . The Constitution thus framed did not create a government of the people ; its whole purpose was to promote and protect the rights of property more than the rights of man . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he is-an American politician , vacillating , uncertain , overlooking the fundamental things , ignorant of the forces that are shaping American public life , incapable of thinking in terms of reality , but making phrases as a substitute for thought . " <P> Of lawyers-in-government . " The lawyers enact the laws , interpret the laws and enforce the laws . The Government is a lawyer-government , and we are a lawyer-ridden country . " <P> Of Grover Cleveland . " His naturally perverse disposition was supplemented by personal habits that made it next to impossible for any one to work with him . " <P> Of McKinley . " The incident gave me an insight into McKinley 's character and may possibly have had something to do , in addition to other things , with my walking out of the St. Louis Convention in 1896 , after McKinley 's nomination . " <P> Of Roosevelt . " Theodore Roosevelt ... sent the following telegram : ' Good Lord , I hope we can beat Pettigrew for the Senate . That particular swine seems to me , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <P> Of Wilson . " Wilson went to Paris as the representative of the New York banks . " <P> Comparing Taft with Wilson . " Taft is amiable imbecility . Wilson is wilful and malicious imbecility , and I prefer Taft . " <P> Of Mark Hanna . " Mr. Hanna was furious at what I had said about him and he determined that he would have revenge ! My term in the Senate would expire in 1901 , and Mark Hanna made up his mind to prevent my reelection . Mr. Hanna raised a vast sum of money to corrupt the voters of South Dakota . ... I was very badly beaten in the election . " <P> Of Senator Edmunds . " I quote from page 192 of Charles Francis Adams ' autobiography : " ... He was distinctly dishonest-a senatorial bribe-taker . ' ... I have tried to decide who this Senator was and I am of the opinion it was Edmunds of Vermont . " <P> Of Chauncey Depew. " ... convinced me that Chauncey Depew was a phrasemaker of but little intellect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So much for the weak Mr. Bryan . Now for the corrupt Joe Cannon . "
