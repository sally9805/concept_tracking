Michigan last week shuffled its criminal code and gave ' leggers a new deal . The State repealed its " life-for-a-pint " law which sent fourth-offending liquor dispensers away for all time . From Michigan 's habitual criminal act were excepted 120 minor felonies , including the wearing of a lodge pin without authority . As a compensation to the Anti-Saloon League , the State Legislature decreed that every prohibition violator must go to jail for from 50 days to four years , and pay a fine of 850 to $3,000.
