In Manhattan is a primly-styled , stone building which houses the Anderson Galleries , famed red plush repository of art and art auctions . On the third floor is tiny Room 303 , known as the Intimate Gallery , littered with picture frames , books , mucilage pots , framed and unframed paintings . In the room , at almost any time during the winter season , may be found a keen-eyed little man in a baggy grey suit . He peers inquisitively through silver spectacles , his grey mustache and hair are scraggly , uncombed . His name is Alfred Stieglitz . He is a lover and maker of photographs. * And he is one of the quietest and most admired characters in the art world . <P> For years Alfred Stieglitz fostered the careers of leading modern painters , such as his second wife , Georgia O'Keeffe , + and water-colorist John Marin . And for years Alfred Stieglitz has been studying beauty with his cameras . <P> Last week he heard that 22 of his prints had been donated to Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More important , they have been accepted and will be hung in the black-and-white section among etchings and engravings . <P> Manhattan , not Florence , Venice or Paris , is the modern cynosure of esthetic eyes . No matter how disinterested the artists , the art centre is always where patrons are thickest , where coffers are bulging . Never before had Manhattan 's greatest museum received photographs into its collections . Such a reception was thus a victory of great moment for photography and for Alfred Stieglitz . <P> Born in dismal Hoboken , N.J. , in 1864 , Stieglitz went to private and public schools and to the College of the City of New York . Following his father 's wishes , he studied mechanical engineering . But photochemistry and photography allured him , and he turned to these subjects , receiving a thorough Germanic induction at the Berlin Polytechnic School and the University of Berlin ( 1888-90 ) . Returning to Manhattan , he practiced photo-engraving for three years , experimented in three-color work , married Emmeline Obermeyer of New York . Then , in 1895 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not become an ample idler ; he took pictures , thousands of them . He had always believed that photography was a medium of art which could be as sensitive , as interpretative as painting , etching or engraving . Out of the confused mass of forms in the visible world he selected serene or startling shapes and contours , the tense grace of sewing fingers , the slopes and rotundities of the nude . These he rendered with the infinite photographic spectrum , ranging from dead white to midnight blackness through numberless greys , catching both gleams and shadows . Sometimes he intellectualized this sensuous process , as in his symbolic expression of a short-skirted girl-a picture of a leg superimposed upon the dim image of a face . There is nothing documentary about Stieglitz photographs ; they tell no stories , perpetuate no events . They are studies in pure form and tone .
