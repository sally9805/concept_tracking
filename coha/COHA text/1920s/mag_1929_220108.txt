As a 6,000,000 share day is to Manhattan 's Stock Exchange , so is a 600-lot day to Manhattan 's Cocoa Exchange-drab , brick , Water St. trading centre that fixes the price of the world 's cocoa . No small amount is 600 lots , however , as one lot equals 30,000 pounds and 600 lots have a value of close to two million dollars . Last week , Cocoa Exchange transactions reached a day 's high of 627 lots , breaking a record of three years ' standing . A seat on the Cocoa Exchange was sold for $6,000 , a rapid advance over the $300 at which charter memberships were priced in 1925 . Thus had cocoa a large and busy week . <P> Food &; Drink . Cocoa laymen think of cocoa chiefly as a beverage , imagine that the cocoa business might be expressed largely in terms of cups consumed . To the cocoa trader , however , drinking-cocoa ( which he calls cocoa powder ) is only a fraction of the industry 's products . To him cocoa and chocolate are identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire chocolate-bar business is also a portion of the cocoa industry . The value of the cakes of chocolate made in a year is about three times the value of the cups of cocoa . The bean was originally grown in South America , was transplanted to Africa some 35 years ago . Now the African Gold Coast produces more than half the world 's supply . Sweet-loving U. S. citizens import approximately one-third of the world-production . <P> Cocoa Exchange . The Manhattan Cocoa Exchange transactions are about twice as large as transactions on all other cocoa exchanges combined , with London and Liverpool exchanges ranking next in size . It was originally ( 1925 ) planned as a cocoa and rubber exchange , but the rubber men did not come in and now have their own exchange . Outstanding furnishings on the rather sparsely equipped Exchange floor include a large battery of telephones and a brass-rail circle occupied by camp-chairs on which the traders perch . Compared to the Wall Street Exchange , there is a noticeable absence of fury , frenzy ; the building has indeed a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the Hershey Chocolate Co. , the Walter Baker Co . ( Postum subsidiary ) and the Blumenthal Bros . There are five Blumenthals , Joseph , Meyer , Aaron , M. I. , and Jacob ; but Joseph , the president , is more potent than his brethren . Last week he bustled busily over the Exchange . He is a small , thin man ( hardly five feet tall ) with a brown suit which he has worn so consistently that it is indelibly associated with him . Of German descent , he is an Orthodox Jew , and rarely visits the Exchange on Saturdays except when there is a very threatening bear market . The main plant is in Philadelphia ; the New York office , at No. 16 Exchange Place , is small as to staff and scarce as to furniture . On the walls hang many photographs of family Blumenthal groups-the various Blumenthals with their wives and children and an old group picture of the five brothers . The Blumenthals are best known through their Raisinettes , a specialty consisting of a chocolate-embedded raisin .
