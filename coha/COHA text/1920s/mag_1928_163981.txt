Another week 's dredging of the Oil Scandals produced proof of how Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair 's contributions to the G. O. P. in 1923 , after a Republican cabinet member had furtively enriched Sinclair with the Teapot Dome lease , were camouflaged by the G. O. P. management . The star witness was James A. Patten , fellowtownsman of Vice President Dawes ( Evanston , Ill. ) - plainspoken , upstanding , oldtime " wheat king " of the Chicago Board of Trade . <P> Mr. Patten appeared before the Senate Committee on Public Lands bursting with readiness to talk . He had , he felt , been duped by a man he called his friend . This was his story : <P> In 1923 , the late Fred W. Upham , then national G. O. P. treasurer , asked Mr. Patten to write out a check for $25,000 to help meet the deficit incurred in the Harding campaign . He said he would give Mr. Patten $25,000 worth of Liberty Bonds in return . The deficit still amounted to six or eight hundred thousands , Mr. Upham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " testified Mr. Patten , " was that I was indignant and mad at the tremendous expense the Republican Committee had gone to . . . . I simply stormed and I am afraid I used bad language . " <P> Mr. Patten explained that Mr. Upham had a " taking " way with him . Mr. Upham used to say to Mr. Patten : " I am the dearest friend you 've got . I cost you the most money . " Mr. Patten , realizing that the deficit had to be met , handed over a check for $25,000 . Mr. Upham said he would soon deliver the bonds . <P> " The more I thought of it , the less I liked its appearance , " Mr. Patten testified . Why should Treasurer Upham dispose of bonds belonging to the G. O. P. so privately when there was a quick public market for them any day ? Mr. Patten worried about it in bed that night . Next day he rid himself of these queer bonds by giving them as his subscription to the Evanston Hospital . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cash contribution in Mr. Patten 's name , identified them last week as part of the $160,000 given by Sinclair to the G. O. P.-a sum which Treasurer Upham and his furtive colleague , onetime National G. O. P. Chairman Will H. Hays , were at great pains to conceal . <P> Satisfied that Mr. Patten had known nothing of the Sinclair-Hays-Upham machinations , Senator Walsh asked Mr. Patten if he knew of other Chicagoans who had similarly been asked to give cash for Liberty Bonds . Mr. Patten knew of none such , but he spoke freely of other Chicago patrons of the G. O. P. He named William Wrigley , " who is in Chicago hardly one month out of the year , " and Arthur Cutten , another grain man . " I presume the McCormicks would come in that list , " Mr. Patten added . <P> Senator Walsh , looking surprised and a little hurt , said : " I would suppose they contributed on the other side . " <P> Mr. Patten : " Well , Cyrus calls himself a Democrat , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , because he was born that way , but I think he votes the Republican ticket about as often . . . . " <P> After Mr. Patten had stepped down , the Committee obtained more Chicago names from William V. Hodges , present G. O. P. treasurer , and prepared to summon them . It also sought the late Mr. Upham 's secretary , one A. V. Leonard .
