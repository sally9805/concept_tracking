Daugherty 1shued the following statement , on which he refused to elaborate : " / have received a call from Mr. Debs . k volunteered no advice to him and he asked none . There were no unusual con- ditions attached to his commutation , His call upon me was of his own volition . " I will shortly give out for publication , with the President 's consent , my recommendation in the Debs case . My object in doing this will be to refresh the memory of the American people of Debs 's violations of the law and to form them of the reason for his commutation . I hope it will be educational to some extent . " I have nothing further to say regarding Debs 's call or regarding his case , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful purpose . T trust that the notoriety he has received may not be'comMercialized . I say this because I observe gathering about him and undertaking to ' promote him persons who have not the best interests of the country or society at heart . ills life 's efforts , pursuing as lie has until now when he . is again a free man a theory erroneous in principle , should not be commercialized . " Debs declined to discuss the conference with the Attorney General except to say , after reading the statement issued by Mr. Daugherty , that he came to Washington before going to Terre Haute at the request of Mr. Daugherty . After leaving the conference with Mr. Daugherty , the - Socialist leader went to the White House , reaching there just before noon , a few minutes after Chief Justice Taft , who had called on the President in regard to a personal matter , left . Debs was taken in to see the President immediately . After a thirty-minute talk with the President , Debs returned to his'hotel , where he received newspapermen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , as well as his conferences with Mr. Harding and Mr. Daugherty . No statement was made at - the White House after Debs 's call . In his tick with newspapermen Debs announced that he would dedicate his newly acquired freedom to " the freedom of political prisoners and the cause of all prisoners . " His future activities , he said , would depend " entirely on how long T will be out . " " When I was advised by the Warden of my release by commutation , " Debs said , " it was coupled with the request of Attorney General Daugherty that I come to Washington to meet him and . President Harding . The Warden furnishedme with a railroad ticket to the capital city for that purpcse . " Debs explained that it was customary upon the release of a prisoner for the authorities to give him his transportation to his home or the place from which he was sentenced , as he preferred , but that the Warden at Atlanta gave him no choice . In ordinary circumstances , he said , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to return to his home and a demonstration of welcome was scheduled for him at Terre Haute , but his plans were set aside because of the request of the Attorney General . I was courteously received by the Attorney General . " he continued , " and expressed to him my interest In and my devotion to my fellow-prisoners who were no more guilty than I and who still remain in prison . " By fellow-prisoners , lie explained , he meant both " political offenders and prisoners in general . " " At the White House , " lie said . " T was received very cordially by . President Harding , . with whom T exchanged opinions and points of view , so that he might perfectly understand my attitude in. reference to my future activities . During the visit I took occasion to express my appreciation of the . eonsideration . Not to Depart Front Principles , " At both the offices of the Attorney General and the President I was assured that my release was unconditional and that of course I would not be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Replying to a question as to his citizenship status , Debs declared his citizenship was " non est . " He said he was now not a citizen of the United States , as the commutation does not restore the rights of citizenship , but a " citizen of the world . " " Where my star was , " he exclaimed , " behold my sun . It is not strange that a man should lose his citizenship in a system where lie is branded as a felon . There is an admirable consistency about that . But a convict for his principles is always a citizen in good standing . He is a citizen by his own inherent , Godgiven integrity . The only man who loses his citizenship is the man who renounces his principles and abdicates his manhood . " Asked about his future activities , Debs declared he would have to adjust himself before making definite- plans and that lie " would take his stand later . " At Atlanta , he continued , he was completely out of touch with developments in the Socialist world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence with it . All so-called liberal papers and magazines , he asserted , were denied him up until three weeks before his release . although he was permitted the " orthodox , capitalistic newspapers . " Even clippings of local happenings in his home town , sent , hitn , by his wife , he declared , were taken from his letters , torn , into bits and thrown into the trash by the prison authorities . Debs expressed himself feelingly of his fellow-prisoners at Atlanta . He was one of them , he said , and . would accept no favors or privileges not accorded the others , and when lie left , lie declared . he left " 2,300 prisoners in tears and cheers . " His commutation , . Debs declared , was " an obligation " to the freedom of " every political prisoner , " time Socialist leader describing himself as the " arch ( memy of prisons .
