LIKE conscientious , but very inexperienced young parents , society is perpetually bewildered and anxious at the New rising about it . In the last years , especially , every sage from the curbstone philosopher to the college president , and every writer from the columnist armed with quips to the sociologist girded with statistics , has been busy with this perennially interesting problem . Our ears are full of the warnings a multitude of voices have been crying : " We are in a period of moral laxity " ; " Ours is an age of jazz " ; " Our easy money is ruining our youth " ; " Too many laws have made us a nation of lawbreakers " ; " Our girls are affecting the vices once confined to men . " On the other hand we hear almost as frequently : " The old prudery is giving way to frankness " ; " Many of the conventions once held sacred were in reality vicious " ; " Victorian idealism was a soft , cowardly way out . " Now both reactions are phrased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fast becoming obsolete . It assumes a point of view from which young people , as I see them in the curious cross-section of American youth known as a state university , are rapidly emancipating themselves : that life is neatly divided into two hemispheres , one called Right , the other Wrong . This conception of life has been the heritage of the English-speaking world for so long that it is no wonder our very vocabulary is colored with it . But to understand , much less guide the new generation , one must get outside that system of thought . The ways of determining the desirability of an action are limited . One may judge it to be right or wrong , pleasant or unpleasant , prudent or foolish , social or anti-social , intelligent or stupid , beautiful or ugly . We English and Americans have always insisted upon the first standard , with its ideal character the psalmist 's " righteous man " instead of Aristotle 's " high-minded man . " The second is the standard of children and childlike races ; as the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions come to be judged as prudent or imprudent , that is , practically wise or practically foolish . The nineteenth century tried , rather futilely , to introduce the social standard . The last two standards are rooted in two ideals which the Greeks always wedded , but which moderns have always insisted upon divorcing : Truth and Beauty . The real Greek trusted the human intelligence to solve the problems of life ; and he was perfectly sure that only the beautiful , whether in art or in conduct , was worth striving for . In every succeeding age and in every nation ( though they undoubtedly appear most often in France ) there have been stray individuals whose minds , less befogged by custom and more coolly reasonable than other minds , have seen a proposed course as intelligent or stupid . At the same time and in about the same proportion , other stray individuals have ? as naturally as they  | breathe ? regulated their lives by the aesthetic standard . Both of these types have stood lonely and apart , lifting puny voices in protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throngs in the dusty mid-way . The reason for the Christian aversion to these last standards is not far to seek . Aristotle and Plato spoke warmly of " that which is fitting for myself . " In the eyes of the early Christian theologians the human self was such a poor little thing that to arrogate to it any power of deciding what is desirable or undesirable would be sheer folly . Moreover , the early Church was faced with the strenuous necessity of assimilating whole nations of barbarians , lusty blood-drinkers who recognized no standard but might . So the code of dogmatic , arbitrary partition of right from wrong , inherited , no doubt , from the ancient Hebrews with their tabulated Thou Shalt 's and Thou Shalt Not 's , was incorporated into the Christian religion . One can not insist too strongly , I think , that the right-and-wrong standard is based on authority . The Roman Catholic Church was for long the authority . What it sanctioned was right ; what it condemned was wrong . With the Protestant revolt came a new authority for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Church . One consulted not a priest but a Bible . When a chapter and verse covered the matter in hand the issue was forthwith settled . In case one could find no chapter and verse which seemed to fit , an efficacious expedient was to open the Good Book at random and accept the command of the first words to meet the eye . Furthermore , there were always certain accepted centers or institutions of authority . One 's church , for instance , which formulated all sorts of specific rules and bylaws for the moral convenience of its members . Or the state , which hustled wrongdoers to the whipping post or gallows . Or parents , whose word was law through the first onethird of life . Or school-teachers , who could and did flog unmercifully . See how authority piled up on every hand ! And when , as was always the case , all these centers of authority agreed as to the rightness or wrongness of any given act , what possible point could there be in the individual returning any answer but unreserved obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course if he were disposed to put himself outside the pale of authority , he could ; and in that case society knew perfectly well what to do with him . One was a good man or a bad man , just as white is white , and black , black . II But bewail it or not as we like , authority is passing . The average young American to-day has no more idea of what is in the Bible than he has of what is in Homer , which any teacher will attest is precious little . Ask fifty university freshmen to explain the simplest biblical reference in Stevenson or Huxley , and perhaps five of them can answer . The only contacts most of them have ever had with the Bible were twenty-minute sessions once a week at Sunday-school , when they read not the Bible but handsomely illustrated story booklets ? or perhaps planned when the class should hold its next picnic or basket-ball practice . A freshman will tell you with round eyes and hushed voice that the Bible is the best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ! A senior , making out his list of ten books he would keep if he could have no others , will head it piously with the Bible , then half an hour later assure you that Nicodemus was a character in one of Shakespeare 's plays ? he ca n't quite remember which . In a recent article Francis Hackett points out that the French and Irish differ from the English and Americans in being un-bibled . He should have added to his " Americans " the saving phrase " of yesterday . " One who comes into any sort of contact with  | young New Yorkers and San Franciscans knows that their attitude toward the Bible is a superstitious reverence for a thing whose valuable properties everybody extols , but of which they themselves are darkly ignorant . Naturally , they have no sense of its personal guidance . Look at the other centers of authority . The Church , torn internally with the modernist-fundamentalist quarrel , tries desperately to retain its hold upon society by relaxing its rules . One of the largest evangelical churches recently repealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring for years . And no wonder . When two-thirds of its members see no harm in dancing or card-playing , how can the church insist upon their evil ? Instead of the individual adjusting himself to the Church , the Church now adjusts itself to him . Consequently , services are exactly half as long as they once were , music and beautiful buildings growing more and more important , sermons and prayers less and less important ; consequently , too , the Church builds social centers with gymnasiums , club-rooms , and billiard halls , all of which would have been frowned on as instruments of the devil a hundred years ago . The Catholic Church retains more authority , but I am inclined to think that , although the young Catholic goes to early mass when he has been to a late dance the night before and although he observes Lent , his compliance is largely superficial and habitual . Too many of them have told me , " Of course I go to church ? it would hurt the folks if I did n't . " Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants as easily as if there were no rule against it . And what of the other centers of authority , the home , the school , the State ? Surely their status to-day needs scant emphasis . The American parent is famous for his subservience . What man addressed as Dad and spoken of as " my old man " could play the patriarch effectively ? Except in the rarest of homes obedience to parental law simply does not exist . In elementary schools authority is still fairly intact , but except in large city-systems where the ponderousness of the educational machine quells rising disorder , discipline is the hardest problem of the secondary teacher . Superintendents and principals of smaller schools always want to know first of all about a prospective teacher , " Is he a good disciplinarian ? " That is , is the force of his personality sufficient to overcome the opposition he will inevitably meet in teaching people who presumably come to school to be taught . As for the authority of the State , who in this day drives under thirtyfive miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or refrains from drinking because it is " right " to do so ? Yet the State says both of these are " right , " and the opposite courses " wrong . " Young America obeys traffic regulations only when a motor-policeman is in sight , or when for some reason slow driving is more pleasant than speeding ; it drinks or does n't drink because the circle it happens to move in drinks or does n't drink . The force we have sought to substitute for the crumbling centers of authority is public opinion . That operates pretty effectively for the average , docile , comfort-loving individual , and for the more intelligent being so long as public opinion is undivided and so long as he does not imbibe the contempt for it which is always in the intellectual air . But let him get hold of the notion that public opinion is a rhymeless , reasonless , thoroughly treacherous old crone who commends his act in one milieu , ridicules it in another , and frowns on it in another , and he sends public opinion packing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the youngster brought up in a home where there was an attempt to make the dogmatic cleavage of right from wrong is worse still . From his earliest recollections his elders have asserted the rightness of some things and  | the wrongness of others . Naturally , he has accepted superior wisdom . But as he begins to make little excursions out from that sheltered field of morality , he finds that apparently perfectly nice people do the things he has been taught to think evil . The flowerlike girl he envelopes in a mist of romantic idealization smokes like an imp from the lower regions and pets like a movie vamp . The chum his heart yearns toward cultivates a hip-flask and " a wicked line with the women , " not to mention a brand of stories which fascinate and revolt him . And , oh , the awful scorn which falls upon him if he protests against such acts as " wrong . " If the force of home authority were stronger , there might be some hope for the lad going on with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America . Unless the boy is not particularly social and unless he is made of rather tough , unyielding fiber , he will , somewhere near the end of his high school or the beginning of his college days , chuck out the right-andwrong standard . I have known a few individuals who went through four years of a state university without revising in the least the standards into which they were initiated in their cradles ; but those people were never influential , and be it remarked , never much respected by their mates . We teachers know that to appeal to our students on that old standard is to waste our breath . The very words in which the appeal must be couched have gone out of their vocabulary . We know that when we assign a portion of Pilgrim 's Progress to be read by sophomores and juniors , they will come up the next day and ask , " What 's he raving about ? " We know that if we undertake to discuss the theology which animated Milton ? or Carlyle , for that matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest of its terms . " Salvation , " " sin , " and " wicked " have lost their connotation ; " righteous , " " pious , " and " saintly " have acquired new and very different ones . The word " moral " itself is going into ill repute . As for " conscience , " one young man assured me gravely that he knew he kept his in his stomach , for every time he ate hot dogs at midnight he was sure to have a bad spell with it . Others humorously bemoan their Puritan ancestors " who cursed me with a conscience . " They know a very great deal about gasoline engines and sports ; but matters like conscience and right for right 's sake strike them as rather foolish . When they appeal to you for advice , as they often do , for they are no less perplexed by the problems facing them than other young people have been , you must take care not to put the advice on the grounds of abstract right and wrong . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and seeks advice elsewhere . Next week you hear that his opinion of you has had a great come-down : he had n't thought you a " pious sort . " And if unhappily you expressed an easy optimism , you are demolished by the single epithet , " Pollyanna . " III In the face of all this would it not be the sensible part to recognize frankly that the standard of abstract right and wrong , with its ideal of righteousness , is moribund ? If we should stop trying to resuscitate it , give it a decent burial , and then set to work to put something in its place , we might perhaps render some service to these jazzy , outspoken , conventional-minded youngsters . The positivistic , humanitarian nineteenth century made a genuine effort to substitute the social standard , but our post-war youth has been too well fed and clothed and motored to find it appealing . He is not altruistic , not sentimental , not idealistic , not romantic . He can stand an amount of emotional stimulus which would have bowled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast to breast , knee to knee  | for three hours to music that would stir a savage to madness ? and then he can go home and sleep . He can sit untouched through the most sensational of movies . The most fervid of evangelical or political oratory glides coolly off his well-groomed back . To appeal to him , the social standard would have to be entirely re-grounded and rephrased : shorn of its emotionalism and what Carlyle called its " rose-pink sentimentality . " Our standard to-day is prudence , practicality , caution . We begin to develop it the first time we discover that what was pleasant enough yesterday sometimes turns out to be extremely unpleasant to-day . Just as soon as we have thoroughly fixed the time-idea in our judgment of pleasantness , we become prudent . Much has been said of the recklessness of this generation . It has been my experience with the fairly large group whom I know intimately that they keep a shrewd weather-eye out for what they call " stuff you ca n't get by with . " " Getting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at times grown so tired of that eternal phrase that I have positively gloried in the few rash youths who refuse to trim their sails to the wind of public opinion , and thereby , I have to admit , make utter fools of themselves . But if there is anything the average collegian will not do it is to let himself appear foolish . He wears what the crowd wears , eats what the crowd eats , drinks and thinks with the crowd . He lives in a time when manners and ideas are standardized , and he is too busy going to places and doing things to worry about being an individual . His very reason for being in college is prudence : he has heard that his chance for a respectable position in society is much greater if he owns a diploma . Prudence is in the air , and he is prudent . There are serious objections to this standard of prudence . The one usually advanced is that it is wasteful : one does n't learn it until one has burned one 's fingers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience with this graybeard philosophy of life . It is this proverbial dearness of experience which frightens parents and teachers who are dealing with children of the high-school age . But contrary to the usual opinion , that seems to me far from the most serious objection . Left to fend for himself , as he usually makes sure that he is left , the average young American is surprisingly precocious in getting his sea legs . If he has had free rein through his last years in high school he has an armor of hardness and sophistication by the time he reaches college which his father probably did not possess at thirty , and his mother may not yet possess . If he does n't have it at the beginning of his freshman year , he will by the end of it . People who still talk sentimentally of " the tender years , " meaning the late teens , should read from sixty to a hundred themes a week for five years as I have done , and should hold three hours a week of conference over anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of a regime like that one feels that he knows what is in the heads and hearts of young people . And except for the rare young person already mentioned who has cone up in a home where the right-and-wrong standard was still rigorously applied , and whose case , just because he is not armored like his fellows , is very sad indeed , I do not worry greatly about the mere wastefulness of the standard which finds its sanction in experience . I am still awed by the sureness and the leveleyed poise with which sorority pledges steer in waters their mothers never dreamed of trying to navigate . They know , these rouged and marcelled seventeen-year-olds , that there is a definite margin of " stuff you ca n't get by with , " and they are careful not to allow any pretty sentiment or rash impulse to take them beyond that margin . No , the really deplorable thing about this prudence is not its wastefulness , but  | its dullness . It is a pedestrian philosophy with no wings for the flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , and no adventure , except the low-grade one of seeing how closely one can skirt the margin of " stuff you ca n't get by with " ? and even that wears out in a few years . It does for the ordinary , earthy souls who conceive of life as a business house , whether factory or amusement hall , but it palls upon souls who by some chance are lighted with a spark of imagination or a flash from another , more romantic world . And worse still , it smothers at birth any fineness of spirit , any largeness of reach which is latent in the individual . It condemns him to a dull , commonplace existence where he never knows the exquisite pleasure of savoring his more delicate and complex emotions . It forbids him the sense of life as a glorious drama in which he has his own not inconsiderable part . It screens from him beauty with all its fine escape from the commonplace . It cuts him off from spiritual values ? dooms him to a boredom which he tries vainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . To me the saddest thing about the generation which is now growing up is its ennui . It has swept out the old sentimentalities ; in the political and social idealism which animated a previous generation it has detected a degree of cant , and it will not tolerate cant ; the wealth amassed by its fathers keeps it from surrender to an absorbing struggle for existence ; machinery has denied it the joy of craftsmanship . It has nothing , except a search for pleasure , to which it can give itself freely and fully . And human life always has and always will go fiat unless it can find something to claim its loyal and eager devotion . I have talked to so many of these young people with their beautifully clothed , thoroughly scrubbed bodies and their listless , rudderless minds , that I have come to feel that never probably was civilization more harsh to a generation . The more intelligent of them understand their situation and , after a period of posing as cynic and misanthrope , scramble about until they find some interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble and go on vainly trying to put some zest in life by amusements of one kind or another . IV Out of this muddle there seems to me a possible way . The old right-andwrong appeal is going , and we may as well admit it ; it could draw the warm and undivided allegiance of men in Cromwell 's time , but it leaves our day cold . Youthful hedonism hardening into prudence is unendurably boring . The social standard by itself will not do . What if we tried one or both of the remaining two ? For some time now James Harvey Robinson has been telling us that we need to take the intelligent view of life , that our hope of solving our problems lies solely in our development of the disinterested , scientific attitude which examines motives and procedures with total disregard of the hoary burden of the past which , like the Old Man of the Sea , squats upon human shoulders . But I wonder if he does not ignore too serenely the immensity of our racial heritage . Perhaps some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly remote . Meantime the mongrel blood in our American veins is too largely Celtic , Anglo Saxon , Teutonic , Slavic , and Southern European to allow the one wee strain of French great influence . True , there are always individuals to whom the most distasteful of all adjectives is " stupid " ; and one of the most encouraging things about young people is the frequency and vigor with which they burst into that damning phrase , " How dumb ! " But Mencken is right about us : we ca n't as a people claim intelligence in the narrow sense in which I am using the word . We are shrewd buyers and clever sellers ; we  | have our share of native wit and a positive genius for organization ? but we do not have that clear , dispassionate faculty which is able to detach itself from the web of likes and dislikes out of which most of us weave judgment . Nowhere is this more plainly evident than in a university . Students have their warm admirations and aversions ; but if some Socratic professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become irritated and thereafter avoid his courses like the plague , or they tolerate him as a " funny old Bolshevik . " In a section of thirty one may expect to find two intelligent students , though he should not be disappointed if there is only one . The occasional section with no youngsters who would have run after Socrates is compensated for by the occasional section with three . The average is a little less than two , about six per cent of the whole . Now if that is true of the supposedly select group in an educational institution , one dares not speculate upon the percentage of intelligence in the country as a whole . I am perfectly aware that even to mention the single remaining standard must seem ridiculous . And yet many conditions to-day are analogous to those which surrounded the Greeks . We have a love of sports and a healthy frankness about our bodies which no age since theirs has possessed . Machinery is fast giving us the leisure which slaves gave to them . We are purged of the exaggerated and sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free from the fear of eternal punishment which enervated us so long , and hence our intellectuals are less timid about scientific and philosophic speculation . In view of these undoubted parallels it seems reasonable to suppose that the love of beauty which animated the Greeks might save us . If it appears a hopeless undertaking ever to instil that love in America , the most notoriously unaesthetic of all nations , stop to consider some small beginnings we have already made . The present fashions of vivid figures in silks , of bright wall hangings , of gay roofs and geranium-filled window boxes all testify to an awakening color sense . Clothing , both masculine and feminine , is vastly better in design and color than it was fifty years ago . Architecture shows a genuine improvement ; houses are not only better plumbed but more often built with an eye to permanent beauty . Contrast the towers and gingerbread atrocities of a wealthy home or the square , boxlike plainness of a more modest house of yesterday with the English and colonial adaptations in the better residence sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic than yesterday . Even automobiles have improved quite as much in line and design as in power and upholstery . Women clutch with pathetic eagerness at anything advertised to make their faces or figures more lovely . Young people shudder away from physical ugliness or deformity in a way that would have seemed unforgivably cruel to their grandparents . Faulty and ridiculous though popular taste may be , it is true that people long to have beauty about them . If they buy mere tawdriness , that is the fault of their taste or purse , not of their instinct . If righteousness rests upon authority , esthetics is a matter of taste , which is a very individual affair . But fortunately taste is much more easily cultivated than the will or the memory ? or the intelligence . A. few good books read with gusto , and one no longer relishes literary froth or crudity . A few weeks with good furniture and one can never again go back to the ugly makeshifts with which one formerly did very well . Even a glimpse of the enchanting richness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is not content with the stodgy , cautious yardstick with which he has been thumbing out his way . Our taste will no doubt always differ from that of the Greeks . A people nursed from its savage infancy by Gothic cathedrals and the institution of feudal- ism with their romantic excesses can not ever return wholly to the Greek " nothing too much . " Especially can it not when it now travels at a hundred-odd miles an hour and piles its buildings fifty stories into the air . Moreover , to whatever extent we have become Christianized our notion of moral beauty must show the influence of the Sermon on the Mount . But whatever its form , this demand for beauty may be no less important for us than for the young Athenians who first thrilled to the " Antigone . " No one who has ever heard a child croon ecstatically over a new dress or toy , " Pit-ty , pit-ty " can doubt that the age-old hunger still lives . What we have usually done to that child is to smile , then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For his artistic edification we gave him the " funnies , " sent him to the movies , and told him pallid stories about minding mother and giving one 's playthings to poor little sick boys . We pecked at him eternally about tidiness , politeness , and truthfulness ? graces acquired by and necessary for society ; but we never said a word about beauty , which is so much older . Through twelve years at a public school we taught him many useful things and some not so useful ; but we neglected to tell him about the handling of color and line and sound , knowledge which he will use or enjoy every day of his life ; we did our best to fit him for a good position in the business world , but we did n't bother to teach him how to live happily with himself . And yet we did not entirely kill his instinct for beauty and spiritual adventure . One who gets to know young people can not really doubt that . The average one has no taste to speak of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the straight path of the daily assignment to talk about aesthetics , all of your class , except the very smuggest or stolidest , awake and listen as they listen to nothing else you say in the course of the year . My most interesting students have almost without exception said wistfully to me at one time or another , " I wish I knew more about such things . " I have heard dozens of seniors and young alumni revile their alma mater because in four years it did not cultivate in them a taste for what they call vaguely , " the finer things of life , " meaning good books , music , paintings ? that is to say , beauty . One of the jazziest of the jazzy ( by a great stretch of the imagination he might almost have come from a " collegiate " story of the College Humor variety ! ) told me once that he had figured out why he always had to be in love : life was so humdrum without it and so beautiful with it . He was astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love poured forth in " The Symposium . " Another chap with more developed sensibilities who had had an unusual mystical experience described it wholly in aesthetic instead of theological terms . I could , had I time , enumerate other not very exceptional instances to show that there is a very real craving for beauty abroad , even on campuses of state universities . But to-day 's crop of young people is so afraid of seeming soft and sentimental , so bent on being prudent and sensible , that in groups ( and they keep themselves in groups as much as possible for it is " queer " to be alone ) one detects in them only the hardness and dull emptiness which are driving faculties to concentrate despairingly upon engineering , accountancy , and industrial chemistry . To know what is really going on behind the bored exteriors which face him , an instructor must be less cynical and more patient in his effort to understand than most instructors are . If he is willing to forego the delights of the faculty clubhouse long enough to cultivate an intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in an obscure corner of their minds a dissatisfaction and dim ache not at all evident at , say , week-end fraternity dances . If he loves beauty himself , that instructor  | can do more real teaching in a half hour over coffee cups than in ten hours in a class room , and do it without preaching . When one is really alive to beauty , the next step , the transition to an ideal of beauty in conduct , is amazingly simple , and may be taken amazingly early in life . It is exactly as easy to say to a child , " That 's not pretty " as , " That 's wrong " ; and , if the child has not been aesthetically stunted , much more effective . A lucky little girl in my acquaintance whose mother has carefully fostered her love of beauty can be brought out of any mood by the remark , " You are n't pretty when you do that , " or turned from any projected naughtiness by , " That 's not a pretty thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty " and " nice " in which the appeal must now be phrased will change naturally to more specific terms like courteous , kindly , truthful , tactful , and charming . But the appeal will be the same . In at least two respects young people have already adopted for themselves the asthetic standard . One is the hatred of cheapness which is so deeply ingrained in them . They loathe imitations and shams ; to most of them a reputation for frequent appearances before a police judge is preferable to a reputation for buying clothes at a mail-order house or toilet articles at dime stores . When they call an acquaintance a " cheap skate " they have done their worst for him . And when one considers all the implications of stinginess , littleness , and vulgarity packed into the phrase , that worst seems enough . But an ethical factor even more important than their disdain for cheapness is their love of good sportsmanship , a basically aesthetic ideal which even their critical elders must find admirable . Say that you consider a course of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unfair and , if he respects your judgment at all , the most blase young Charleston expert will wince . And he does not fool himself into thinking those qualities wrong or imprudent . They are simply not the fitting or comely way to play the game . Thus do young people recognize that the original meaning of " fair " is after all " the agreeable to the sight . " Just one more concrete illustration . Last spring a freshman whose intensity and refractoriness had troubled me all winter stopped at my desk and asked to walk home with me . We talked of this and that until I turned to relieve him of my books at my door . Then he got out , " Tell me what you think of free love . " I assured him that I thought any real love must be free , but that in the technical sense in which I presumed he used the phrase , I thought it might be a fine name for promiscuity , which did n't seem to me particularly desirable . He went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about had almost converted him to the theory . When I asked about her , he said she was older , had been married and divorced , he thought , and now practiced what she preached . " Oh , she knows her oats , " he summarized . A day or two later he came to the office . He had an engagement with the girl for that night . Some last little pang of indecision had sent him in search of advice . I tried prudence first , pointing out that he was inexperienced , the girl experienced , mentioning possible legal and physical consequences of no very attractive color , and emphasizing the irrevocableness of the step . My arguments failed to touch him . His eyes glowing , he said he thought he could manage the situation . He had always been kept too " innocent " at home ? it was time he was growing up . Then I tried the other way . Had he thought much about love ? Oh , yes . With his fondness for pretty things he would want love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did not this thing he was contemplating seem a pretty cheap substitute for the lovely experience he dreamed of ? Ye-es , but he did n't think it was wrong ; nobody  | much except his parents seemed to think so nowadays . Inwardly cursing a home which could send a boy into our world to-day with no moral equipment but the brittle right-and-wrong standard , I told him that I did n't know that I thought it wrong , but it did seem to me cheap , as if one were so anxious for a diamond that one put on a ten-cent bauble instead of saving for the real thing . I shall never be sure that that got him , but I learned later that he postponed " growing up " for at least that night . The aesthetic standard is naturally more appealing to youth than the rightand-wrong or the prudent-and-foolish because it is more positive and more adventurous . It is right not to steal , not to covet , not to outrage another 's feelings ; it is prudent not to attempt the things experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast park strewn with " don'ts " with no interesting possibilities of " do " in evidence . Put it the other way : theft , covetousness , and wanton violation of another 's personality are ugly things which do not belong in the pattern of grace and charm upon which we are shaping our lives . Hence we are not concerned with them . But generosity of spirit , tolerance , and a fine kind of courtesy are lovely qualities which it is worth while to embody in the pattern . This patient effort to make " what is fitting for myself " really a part of myself demands a lofty notion of myself , even though tempered with an intelligent estimate of the clay in my composition . ! Esthetic morality is summed up in the sentence one hears everywhere : " That would be a lovely thing to do . " No compulsion , no hope of reward or fear of punishment is expressed here ? only an appreciation of the richest of all pleasures , a sense that one is doing the act appropriate and magnanimous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the highest possible standard . May I go farther ? If morality or , for that matter , interesting living is ever again to be possible for a civilization which denies itself the sanctions of eternal punishment or reward , it must come when a love of beauty is so much a part of us that we shrink away from the ugly and strain toward the lovely deed .  |
