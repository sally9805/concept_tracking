txt Going back , in this second article of myl series for THE NEW YORK TIMES on the America 's transatlantic trip , to the period of preparation , I want to say a word about-the matter of selecting the ' time and weather for our trip . We made up our ' minds that we would shove off only after Colonel . Lindbergh got back , as we thought that was the courteous thing to do . After his reception at home was over we waited for favorable weather . Although it was reported . a number of times that we were going to leave the following morning , I never gave the word that we were going until I o'clock in the morning on - the 29th .. And we went when we said we would . - - It was not until then that Dr. Kimball of-the - . Weather Bureau , and his . assistants , Messrs .. Barrett and gossbY ; gave us their 0 . K. Up to that time the weather was reported dangerous . It was not even then ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were determined that we would not wait for ideal weather ; we- only wanted an even break . Indeed , if we got a little adverse weather we could prove more . , Weather Man Did " Splendidly . " These weather reports deserve the greatest . credit for predicting the weather ' for . three flights : Lindbergh 's , Chamberlin 's and ours . In my opinion they did splendidly. - This is the first ? time such weather prognostications have been made , and this beginning is destined to develop eventually into a very efficient and satisfactory meteorological service for the Atlantic . The Weather Bureau cooperated with us in every way and the Radio Corporation of America did great work , sending reports to the Weather Bureau from transatlantic steamers . It was raining just before ? we took off and- it was thick and drizzly from the time we left until about ' 8:30. - For ' the first few hours we got as much altitude as we could for safety and gave more attention to the safety factor than to speed . We had fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was quite rough , especially ' going over Nova Scotia . We kept a sharp lookout all along , the ' route ' for Nungesser and Coll . We always had ' been anxious to search for them and thought there was a slight chance that they might have landed in some rugged place ' in Newfoundland or . Nova Scotia and cracked up their machine . ? On the way to Newfoundland we had- a splendid opportunity to . get some excellent data on the altitude at which to fly : in order to get " the most help from ' the wind . In ? other words , to pick out the shortest air route . If the best advantage is taken of the winds the route can be shortened ; about 800 miles , and we were anxious that our flight should do ' something toward contributing to this improvement . ' Reached 3,000 Feet With Heavy Load . The most difficult- thing about these long flights is suspending the great loads in the air . We soon got up to ? 3,000 feet , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy load aboard . ? Of course , we could have taken considerably more gas if lwe had left the radio out , taken only two men and not taken three ? or four hundred pounds of emergency . equipment , mail , food , medical supplies , &c.; We deliberately sacrificed the cruising radius in an effort to provide for every emergency , just as commercial planes of the future must do . Data on How to Combat Bad Weather . Now that it is over I am glad we . had such difficult weather , conditions , because our flight proven what an air plane ' can survive , and I believe we learned something abOut what to do in such - bad weather . For example , when flying for hours through fog or over one layer of eloudS , With , another layer above , the only tossible way ' to accountlor ' Alle ; vvind drift is . to take radio bearings from ships . This could-IreadilyIbe , so worked out that - bearings , - could be procured for - the - whole flight . in another article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift and- position , for in those nineteen hoUronwhen:we saVineither , Water , nor land-and , seldeM -I realized more ' fully than ever ; how ? Mportant to transatlantic flying this ; question is . We had fog clouds practically the whole way , from before we reached Newfoundland and until we came down at Ver-sur-Mer . For today I shall confine myself to describing as well as I can the trip itself and leave its lessons for another time . As I looked through the trapdoor when passing north of Halifax the shadow of the America showed clear on a cloud below us and there was around it a very beautiful rainbow that remained with the plane . I could not help but think it was an augury a good omen . Little did we imagine the struggle that lay before us . Oil Leak Scare Proves Unfounded . Soon after we got over Newfoundland I saw a big stream of oil floating aft on the deck . I thought it was an oil leak , and a bad one , which , if true , would place us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind an oil leak we had on the Josephine Ford when we were one hour from the Pole and when we thought there was not the slightest possibility of getting back . Immediately I got hold of Noville , who was forward , and we found it was not a leak , but that he had spilled some oil in pouring it into the engines . Then began those nineteen hours from the time we met the fog over Newfoundland until we came out of it . In my log I find this note , which was made then : " I take my hat off to the boys . Their efficiency and calm-1 tress are marvelous . " Several hours after leaving Newfoundland I trot a note ' from Noville giving the amount of gasoline left . I made some quick calculations and found that we had burned forty-four gallons of gas an hour , that going on at anything like that rate of consumption and with the winds in any way against us it would be impossible to reach the other side . We had gone too far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get on the northern side of the ? storm area or the southern side of the high-pressure area and the winds would probably be against us and we would certainly have to make a forced landing in the Atlantic . I did not tell the boys this because there was no use worrying them , but for hour after hour I was worrying whether the winds were with us . I knew that the higher we flew the greater the winds we would have , if the weather map was correct . If not correct , the higher we flew the more we would probably be held back . We chanced everything on flying high and so attempted to keep over the fog clouds as much as possible . When the time came for the sun to set we had just managed to get above the highest tips of the great clouds . The sun went down in a blaze of glory . Then began a great struggle during the hours of that first night to keep out of the clouds . From time to time the banks stretched above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments . I could n't help but admire the way Balchen and Acosta kept at their jobs . It was a great comfort at this time to get some radio messages . The radio worked splendidly all the way across , and Noville deserves the greatest possible credit . Although still in the clouds when the dawn broke , the light was very welcome . All that day we had only very occasional glimpses of the sun and sometimes in the fog we could barely pee the wingtips of the plane . " Terrible Scenes " of Fog Valleys . ? When we got above the clouds there were at times some terrible views . We would look hundreds of feet into fog valleys  --  dark , ominous depths . At times the cloud peaks on the horizon looked exactly like a land of mountains . At other times they took on the appearance of a beautiful lake or a river which showed blue against the gray of the clouds around . Once when we were flying at an altitude of about 10,000 feet water was dripping into our cabin from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the steamer Ulgaland , which told us that our signals were coming so strong that we must be very near them and asked if we could see them . They Said they too were covered with fog . They gave us a radio bearing and soon after that we got a message from the steamer Paris , which also said that our radio was so strong that we must be near them . They gave us a bearing that verified our calculations and told us the clouds were low and the wind from the west . This last information was very encouraging . I asked Noville for another report on gas , and to my great joy found that we had many hours ' supply of gas left . I got together with him and found he must have made some mistake in the first estimate given me . We had enough gas to take us far beyond Paris . . Sight of Water Welcome . When finally we saw water , it was indeed a most pleasant sight . It was still cloudy , but we could . get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the drift and speed very Carefully from then on until we struck land . We did not sight any ships until we got quite near land ; then ' we paiied  --  a large number of them . We were naturally delighted when we sighted Cape Finisterre . Then we began receiving radio messages from all directions . It seemed as if the - whole of . Europe was trying to get in touch with us . I set a course for Paris and checked very carefully ' on the cities and points of land we should see . Soon it began to get dark and the weather so rainy - " and thick at times that we could not check on the lighted cities below us . I was not apprehensive about hitting our objective , because we had done pretty well with our compasses . over 3,000 miles and I saw no reason why we should not steer accurately the remaining 300 miles . We saw some bright beacons ahead at about the time we should be at Paris , when I was so confident that.we were there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Wanamaker that Paris was in sight . But when we reached the bright lights we found , to our great astonishment , that we had come to some amusement resort on the water . Our compasses had taken us in a circle instead of in a straight line ; but it was difficult to tell whether the circle was to the right or the left and impossible to know its diameter . ? So we found ourselves in a most disconcerting predicament , not knowing our position with certainty , our gas giving out before morning and unable to see land beneath-us , as it was a very dark night and the weather was thick . I judge that we had circled left , and I more or less guessed our position and set another course for Paris . This was a very oritipal tine indeed , because , if after flying several hours and 0 , P. &; A. Photo . ACOSTA EXAMINING THE AIRPLANE 'S MOTOR , AFTER THE WRECK AT VER-SUR-MER . Photograph Carried by Airplane to London , - Thence Cable by Bartlane Process to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced landing on our return and not only smash the plane to pieces but run a big chance of injuring some one beneath us . ? It is certain that our compass went bad when we aimed for Paris the first time , and Balchen afterward checked with me that something seemed wrong with the compass during that time . Absolves Compasses , Blames Magnetic ? Attraction . But when I set the second course , I checked both compasses together and found they were 0 . K. I do not believe there was anything wrong with the compass-7it was some local affection , probably from some magnetic material that had been moved in the ship . We continued our course until we thought we could be at Paris , but the weather was so thick that I believe that if we had been very close to the beacon at Le Bourget we could not have seen it . We have been told that our engines were heard there with a sound intensifier , but I am not able to corroborate that statement . We reached the point where , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be likely to have a forced landing before our return to water . It would be utterly impossible to land on unknown land without smashing everything to pieces . Landing on Water Their Only Hope . We therefore determined to head for water and land there the best way we could . That we would not be able to see water very clearly we knew , and I do not believe I ever heard of anybody landing on a pitch dark night on water without a light . But , at any rate , it was our only hope . I want to pause here again and mention my shipmates . Here they were faced with a situation where the chances of survival were small , yet they continued to function efficiently . At the same time that I admired them beyond words , I felt that the entire responsibility was mine  --  that it was I who had invited tIlem to make this flight with me and that missing Paris was my fault . I will not note here the thoughts that went through my head at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the families these fellows had and I thought of their great delight when I invited them to make this trip with me . Prepare to Save Data , at Least . qwq I set'our course to take us back to the amusement resort we had seen , because at least there was some light there . We came out of the fog and saw it several times from above : . We circled slowly around . and attempted to find some-landing place near , but there was none . The only other thing we could see was some revolving light some distance away . We made for . it , . hiving that ; the .. flashes of this light would enable . us to see the water - sufficiently to judge our distance above it when we came down . But when we got there we found that the beams of light traveled so rapidly over the water that they were of no use to us ... Gas Gets Low and They Land . We had brought with us for nivigatiOn purposes some bombs which would ignite on striking water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting low and-we decided tO try a landing . Balchen was at the wheel . We . came down as slowly as possible without losing-flying speed and falling into the water . The wheels touched first and were shorn off the fuselage . ' ' A second or WO afterward - there was a smash and the whole plane instantly filled . With water : Noville says that he saw me shot out of the window out of - which I was looking to try , to judge the distance above the water . ? I found myself swimming around ' and gi ; c4m back to the window and heard Noville calling fq*.me.fl I yelled to him , but was not sure he heard me . But I could dimly see him getting out of the window on the other side . He afterward told.me that forty-two hours of ? roaring engines had deafened-shim , se that ' when I called himile could barely hear my voice . - Seeing that he was safe , I swam forward to the cockpit . Reaching ' in for - Balchen , I found him extricating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf , Which , I did ' not realize at the time . I yelled at the top of my voice for Acosta , but got no answer . I.thought he was pinned somewhare- under the water . We looked in- the cabin , but-could 310t- sge-biro. - and : thought that he might have been thrown clear and stunned . We contint , ed to yell for him and looked around , but could not find him . It was very . dark . The plane was floating with a wing under the water , which meant that the whole of the fuselage was under water also . Presently Acosta appeared , and , believe me , Ioas the happiest man in the world . Groan Front Hurts as They Row Ashore . Our emergency compartment with equipment for use in case of a forced ' landing at sea was placed where we thought there would be the least chance of its getting under water . Our calculations were right . The top of the compartment was clear . Noville ripped it open and was soon getting out our rubber boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed on top of the wings and started pumping air into the boat . As every one was stiff and bruised , this was not an easy thing to do . The great tank , which was now empty of gas , was holding the plane up , and that both pleased and helped us . We landed when the tide was high , and I believe we were in not more than ten or fifteen feet of water . With grunts and groans , we embarked in our rubber boat and rowed ashore . We carried the boat up the beach and headed for the nearest light , which seemed to be about a mile away . When we reached the little village , we found it was not easy .. to rouse the inhabitants . The houses had fences around them and the gates were locked . We jangled the doorbells , but to no avail . Finally we went to the lighthouse and found the lighthouse keeper and his wife awake . I think they first thought we . were questionable characters ? we certainly looked it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had landed from America there was great excitement and from then on we received the kindest , most courteous and hospitable attention possible from the people of the village , which happened to be Ver-sur-Mer . As long as I live , I shall never forget them , and as I thanked my host on leaving he said that not only had he done this for me but had done it for affection for America .
