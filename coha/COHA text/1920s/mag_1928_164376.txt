Artists , especially U. S. artists , more especially U. S. artists with radical theories , are often heard to whine and mumble because men with money , i. e. , art patrons , prefer to buy the works of " old masters . " These whining , muttering artists are to some extent justified . But what must have been their surprise , their delight mixed with dismay , to learn , last week , that an anonymous art patron , i. e. , a man with money , had spent $41,000 for 32 of the works of John Sloan , famed extant U. S. painter , president of the ultra-radical Society of Independent Artists ? <P> Artist Sloan 's first notable paintings were those which he made of Manhattan or Philadelphia streets and houses , engrossing not alone because they are energetic paintings full of motion and the suggestion of sound , but also because the scenes which they depict are now vanished . In these paintings-The Rathskeller , Philadelphia , Scrubwomen in the Old Astor Library , John Butler Yeats at Petitpas , The City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic grief that really appears in the faces of city people . Later , small , sparrowlike John Sloan left the city and painted in rock-bound Gloucester and puebloed Santa Fe . Recently he has been back again in Manhattan , painting cars and trolleys , houses with lighted doors and windows , loafers , little girls playing in the streets . The paintings which he sold , through the Kraushaar Galleries , to the anonymous plutocrat , include examples of his work in all three periods . <P> It would have been hard to find a more representative radical among modern U. S. artists than John Sloan . In 1907 , before the advent of cubism and futurism , he was listed among the " original 8 , " * revolutionist painters who were contrasted with the conservatives ' " original 10 . " In 1918 , he was elected president of the Independent Artists , to succeed William J. Glackens , and has since modestly declared that he is still president only because he has been " unable to get out of it . " <P> Though the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works of a living U. S. artist , it still did not rival the $55,000 which Mr. Knoedler &; Co. paid when the collection of the late Charles H. Senff was sold last week , for Frans Hals 's Portrait of a Dutch Lady . It is an interesting demonstration of the force of fashions among collectors that , in one evening 's bidding at the same sale , 35 pictures by members of the Dutch School , Velazquez , and Corot ( whose works bring the highest prices of all more recent artists ) were sold for $346,150 . The rest of the collection which onetime Sugar Merchant Senff had made in the 1890 's brought the total price to $580,375 . Governor Alvan Tufts Fuller of Massachusetts had his dealers buy Corot 's Nymph Bathing . <P> <P> *The other members of the " original 8 " : Arthur B. Davies , Robert Henri , Ernest Lawson , Everett Shinn , William J. Glackens , Maurice Brazil Prendergast , George Benjamin Luks . Five of them are Philadelphians.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
