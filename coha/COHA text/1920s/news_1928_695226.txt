txt A fallacy regarding German reparations vas given currency by Professor Gustave Cassel , noted Swedish economist , in an address at the University of Chicago . " Germany , " be said . " can not pay her war indemnities while the United States maintains a high protective tariff. - If payment of German reparations depended upon a German merchandise export balance and the market for those goods were in the United States alone . and if the tariff prevented their entry payment would be hindered to the extent that the tariff interfered with the marketing of the goods here . But the share of the payments coming to the United States is insignificant , over half goes to France and nearly all the remainder to countries other than the United States . Before the war England was a great market for German products , and she is a beneficiary under the reparation plan . France and other indemnity creditors arc consumers of German goods . Finally , the whole world is one great trading market , and the consuming power of many of those countries is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Germany to cultivate those markets , accumulating the balance the professor thinks necessary to meet the payments . But evidently , he reasons that the transaction must be between the two counries , Germany and the United States , for he said : " The United States must necessarily be confronted with Germany as the ultimate payer of debts owing from France and other war-debt countries , with German exports as the ultimate means of payment . If the creditor country does not wish to receive the goods of the debtor country the payment of debts must meet with insuperable obstacles . " When the French war debt to the United States is funded our annuities from all the war debt countries will be a little more than half the standard German reparation payments . Probably , from $300,000.000 to $350,000 , - 000 annually will come to the United States through war debts . This compares with the $625,000,000 annual reparation payments by Germany to the beneficiaries under the Dawes plan : Furthermore , the United States has not agreed to the substitution of Germany in the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England and the other debtor countries for the payment of their war debts , while they in turn look to Germany as their debtor under the Dawes settlement . To the extent that those countries , France for instance , are dependent upon reparations for payment of their debts to us , Germany is the ultimate payer of their debts . It is possible also that some tine the German reparation debt may be commercialized and pass into private hands . Germany then would be owing individuals instead of governments and more of those individuals might be in the United States than elsewhere , but the payments or rather the transfer of the paymenti would not be effected any differently from now . Finally , neither now nor in the future must " German exports be the ultimate means of payment . " This is not economic heresy , the facts prove its truth . In 1927 we had an export balance of $548,000,000 for merchandise and silver , but the world did not owe us anything . The " invisible " trade accounted for this . Before the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interest was transferred to England , not by goods alone , but by " invisible " items also and by further investments of English capital . That way is open for Germany .
