txt Jack Dempsey will defend his world 's heavyweight championship title against Gene Tunney , ex-marine , challenger , in a bout to be conducted in the Sesquicentennial Stadium in Philadelphia on the night of Thursday , Sept. 23 . This announcement was made last night by Promoter Tex Rickard . The battle had been scheduled for the Yankee Stadium here on Sept. 16 and was transferred as the result of the refusal of the License Committee of the New York State Athletic Commission to issue a license to Dempsey to box in this State . The License Committee persisted in holding up the permit , even after Attorney General Albert Ottinger had rendered an opinion that the champion was entitled to one . This left no other course open to Rickard to hold ' the fight here without going to court . Rickard declared the bout would be held with the approval of Governor Gifford . Pinchot of Pennsylvania , and that he had been assured there would be no interference from officials in that StsAe . Promoter Rickard 's Statement . His formal statement follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dempsey-Tunney bout to Philadelphia . - I have made every effort to hold this match in New York , because I felt that New York was entitled to the match and that I had no right to take from the State in which I have so many interests . the money which will accrue , directly or indirectly , from this bout . I received strong and generous assistance in my New York efforts from Commissioners George E. Brower and William Muldoon , but the time came when they could do no more . The only recourse left to me was the courts . After considering the matter I am unwilling to proceed to this extremity . First , I have no desire to do anything which might react upon the sport of boxing , and , secondly . I feel I should not make myself responsible for any perhaps permanent break in the ranks of those that govern the game in this State . I owe much to boxing and have always refused to do anything which might hurt it . During my negotiations here E. L. Austin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited me to hold the bout in Philadelphia , promising me no opposition and every cooperation . I have acz .. cepted the invitation . The Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission , after conferring with Governor Pinchot , has sanctioned the bout . And I have been assured by Frank Wiener . Chairman of the commission , that there will be no difficulty in the way of holding it . Governor Pinchot has said that so long as boxing is legal in the State and so long as the bout is sanctioned by the commission . Pennsylvania will welcome it . Mayor Kendrick of Philadelphia has joined Mr. Austin in the invitation to bring the match to his city . I also have talked with James F. Ryan , Assistant City Solicitor of Philadelphia ; Robert A. Young , Secretary of the Boxing Commission ; Richard Fucts , who acted as my personal representative to report on conditions , and others , and they all assure me that Philadelphia wants the bout and that it will be a great success there I will have a concrete stadium which can be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to obtain a perfect view of the ring . I will have the advantage of the Sesquicentennial , which Mr. Kellogg and Mr. Hoover have publicly pronounced the greatest world 's fair ever held . I will have the backing of the Boxing Commission , the Mayor and the Governor , and I believe that , - under the conditions , this will be the greatest contest and the biggest boxing bout ever held . Associated with me in holding this contest will be Jules Aaronson of Philadelphia . The bout will be held on Sept. 23 , the change of location necessitating ' the change in the original date . I am sorry to take the match from New York , but I am glad that it goes to Philadelphia .

In the event that the judges fail to agree upon a winner the referee will render a decision . Had the fight been held here it would have been for fifteen rounds , the maximum under the New York law , and in reaching a decision two judges and a referee would have collaborated . Prpmoter Jules Aaronson of Philadelphia will assist Promoter Rickard in conducting the title bout . He conducts weekly bouts in the Winter at the Arena , and in the Summer he operates at the National League baseball park In Philadelphia . Rickard last night formally filed his application for a promoter 's license in Pennsylvania , and his check for $125.50 accompanied the application .

The prices for the match will be S5.50 , $7.70 , $11 , $16.50 , $22 , $25 and $30 for reserved seats . The general admission price has not yet been fixed , but probably will be set at $3 . In this connection it was pointed out that the two highest-priced sections on the ticket scale would carry no tax levy for the spectator . Had the match been held here the maximum admission charge would have been $27.50 . No change v.-iti be made in the shares Dempsey and Tunney are to receive , so far as could be learned . Dempsey is said to have signed with Rickard originally for $450,000 and Tunney for $150,000 . Rickard Puts Up $50,000 . Promoter Rickard last night presented to Secretary Young of the Pennsylvania Commission his check for 550,000 to be held as a forfeit .

Immediately upon the performance of the condition , that is , the holding of the said bout , the money shall be returned to you . If at the end of the year you have been unable to comply with the conditions of the bond the money shall also be returned to you . If you have failed to perform any of these conditions the money is forfeited to the use of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . Rickard Also Puts Up Bond . Rickard 's personal bond for-$50,000 , without any demand for other security , has been posted with the Sesquicentennial Exposition Executive Committee at another guarantee for the fight , making $100,000 that the promoter has pledged . The decision of Pennsylvania 's boxing authorities to have the bout taken to Philadelphia was not unanimous . Chairman Wiener and Commissioner Havey Boyle of Pittsburgh cast the deciding votes on the three-man board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , a negro , who is the third member of the board , refused to vote on the matter . The vote was taken yesterday morning before the Pennsylvania authorities left for this city , Chairman Wiener said . In addition to feeling assured of freedom from official interference , Rickard is safeguarded against discipline from the New York State Athletic Commission by transferring the bout to Philadelphia even though Dempsey is not licensed in this State . " I have no worry over possible reprisal from the New York Commission , " said Rickard . " I have no need for worry . The New York Commission sanctioned the Dempsey-Tunney match by a majority vote , recognized Tunney as a capable and proper challenger , issued a license to him , and by the same majority vote recommended that a license be issued to Dempsey . I am violating no rule or regulation of the New York Commission , so have nothing to fear . " Chairman Wiener of the Pennsylvania Commission supported Rickard . " Plans for the Dempsey-Tunney bout to be held in Philadelphia were first launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been approached eight or ten times , at least , since then and have been requested to move actively in the plans . But I would not take a step in the matter until New York decided definitely that it did not want the match . We have a working agreement with the New York Commission which is observed , but I feel we are not violating this agreement in accepting the match , since the commission has gone on record as in favor of the bout and in favor of giving Dempsey a license . When it was decided positively that the match could not be held in New York without court action , and Promoter Rickard decided against moving in the courts , 5 was very glad to get the bout for the State of Pennsylvania . " I wish to state here and now that there will be no interference of any official nature with the snatch . I did not proceed in the matter without first consulting Governor Pinchot and Mayor Kendrick , and each executive assured me he entertained no opposition to a Dempsey-Tunney bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . of the gross receipts from the fight , an amount which will be $200.000 if the bout attracts a gate of $2,000,000 . This figure will shatter all right receipt records , and if the capacity of 150,000 people is achieved in attendance the crowd records will be broken . The best previous attendance was between 90,000 and 100,000 at the DempseyCarpentier fight in Jersey City five years ago , and the receipts record is $1,600,000 , made by that fight . j'he State of Pennsylvania will collect a 5 per cent . tax from the fight , which is expected to amount to $100,000 . New contracts for the fight will be signed by Dempsey and Tunney for Promoter Rickard next week , it was announced . Possibility of difficulty in this connection was dismissed by Rickard with a smile . " The boys are ready to go wherever I say they go , " said the promoter . Dempsey was notified last night he would have to break camp at his training quarters at Saratoga Lake , and , according to Rickard , made plans to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the titleholder will go to the Delaware Water Gap in the Pocono Mountains . Tunney also was notified he would have to break camp and replied he would be ready within a few days . One of the conditions of the transfer to Philadelphia is that both fighters train in Pennsylvania , preferably near Philadelphia . New Tickets Ordered . Rickard issued orders yesterday for printing of new tickets for the bout , at the same time dispatching to the scrapheap the tickets he had printed for theproposed bout here . The Philadelphia tickets will be printed with a stub which will entitle the holder to access to the exposition grounds throughout the day of the bout . It was announced b " Director General Austin that the admission charge of fifty cents would be suspended on the day of the bout for all those holding tickets to the fight . An elaborate lighting system Is available at the Sesquicentennial Stadium , Promoter Rickard said , and he added that in all other respects conditions for a bout in Philadelphia are snore favorable , if anything , than they are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a surprise , although it was recognized that Rickard , either had to move to Philadelphia or accept the alternative of court action , which undoubtedly would have been long drawn out and might nave ended with no fight at all . Opinion generally was to the effect that in view of the short time available until Sept. 16 , - the date Rickard originally set for the bout here , the promoter would in the end be compelled to abandon the match . Promoter Rickard will leave this morning for Philadelphia with his staff of clerks and ticket sellers to arrange details of launching the clerical work and the task of ticket I distribution . In his transfer Rickard proceeded I because of necessity and not out of choice . His efforts to have the match held here met with official opposition almost from the start . Chairman James A. Farley on the State Athletic Commission led this opposition to a Dempsey-Tunney bout , maintaining that Harry Wills deserved the first chance at the title and persisting in his attitude for a Dempsey-Wills match or none at all here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became divided , Cornmiszioner George E. Brower siding with Commissioner William Muldoon in favoring a DempseyTummy match , but then opposition was encountered from the License Committee of the State Athletic Commission , composed of Colcnel John J. Phelan , Chairman , and D. Walker Wear of Binghamton . This board sefused to grant Dempsey a license after issuing a license to Tunney . The committee 's refusal of Dempsey 's license was not specific , but was contained in an action whereby the committee went on record as deferring action on Dempsey 's application , first until the champion had compiled with the rules and regulations of the commission , and finally until Dempsey accepted Wills 's challenge . With Commissioners Muldoon and Brower swinging the majority vote on the commission against Chairman Farley and favoring a DempseyTunney match , and the License Committee refusing to act on Dempsey 's application , an impasse was created which was not remedied even when Commissioner Brower requested and received an opinion from Attorney General Ottinger , in which it was stated the License Committee was exceeding its authority in refusing to grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief in the courts and insisted over the last two days that he was to take the fight to court , but it developed yesterday that he had been working quietly all along on the Philadelphia transfer .
