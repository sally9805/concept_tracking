Senator Borah opened his campaign for relection . The Republicans had been praying him to give them strong support . LaFollette had asked him to follow Brookhart into the Progressive fold . The reason both wanted Borah was because , with the possible exception of LaFollette , politically he is the strongest man west of the Mississippi . And it is a good guess that the reason for his strength is that he does not do the kind of thing they asked him to do . <P> Borah has the strength of isolation . In ordinary men , isolation is a weakness . It is always a limitation . But coupled with a certain moral grandeur it is also a power . Senator Borah has that power . It is that rather than rhetoric which makes him the only orator of the Senate who can pack the galleries with people who come for the sheer glory of hearing him . Washington - cynical , politically overfed Capital - hangs , not on his words , but on the power of his convictions . In the Senate , Borah weighs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake LaFollette , not because he is part of a powerful machine , not because he is witty , not because he is shrewd , but because he is Borah . He has neither followers nor leaders and he needs none . <P> The opening speech of his campaign at Idaho Falls was typical of his attitude-prepared to give everyone ( devil , fool or solon ) his due , and to take his constitutents ' votes-for Borah . <P> His Supporters . " I have been nominated by two parties . My nomination at the hands of the Progressive Party was generous , unanimous and free from pledges . I have no words adequate to express my appreciation , my deep sense of obligation , for their expression of commendation and confidence . <P> " The Progressive Party in this state is made up very largely of farmers and workingmen from whom , for 20 years , I have had the most constant and unselfish support . . . I am greatly honored by their gracious approval . I offer no apology for their endorsement ; on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> His Policies . " I am not unmindful of the feeling upon the part of many of my political associates that I am indifferent to party ties . <P> " It is claimed by many that I am not a party man . This feeling arises , I presume , out of the fact that there are times when I vote and express views out of harmony with supposed , or temporary , party policies . It would be insincere upon my part to apologize for the past . It would be sheer deception to lead you to expect anything different in the future . <P> " I claim the right as your Senator to oppose any measure by whomsoever proposed which I believe to be injurious to the public interest or unwise in Government . I claim the right to support any measure by whomsoever proposed which I believe to be in the public good and in the interest of sound government . This states the whole thing . " This is the sum total of my of fending , if I have offended . I wish my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doubt . I do not take positions thoughtlessly or in differently . " <P> Coolidge . " It was not long after Calvin Coolidge was made President of the United States until he announced he must have economy and then more economy .
