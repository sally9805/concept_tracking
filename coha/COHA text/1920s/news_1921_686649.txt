txt The proposed additional export taxes on Mexican oil represent about 100% increase , as they would bring the average tax payment up to more than 30 rents a barrel , compared with 15.6 cents under the present law . Certain light grades of crude would have to pay almost 40 cents a barrel . The oil men are strong in the protest against the proposed increase not only on the tax rate , but also on the Mexican Government 's method of valuing oil . For purposes of taxation it bases its tax rate on the price of oil in New York , which because of transportation charges is naturally much greater than in Mexico . Thus what is made to appear an ordinary tax from the Mexican viewpoint becomes confiscation because of the false basis of valuation . E. L. Doheny , president of the Mexican Petroleum Co. , says regarding the proposed export tax : " The total of the proposed export taxes on Mexican crude amounts to about 30 cents a barrel . The export tax , according to Circular 96 , is 15.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect this will be Increased to about 30 cents a barrel . The present tax is over 30% and the proposed additional tax will increase this to 60% of the selling price of the oil . " While the tax decree at present in effect has been legalized by act of Congress , the valuations placed on the oil , upon which taxes are calculated , are illegal because they make the theoretical 10% tax an actual 30% tax . The proposed decree , if issued by the president and not passed by Congress , is unconstitutional . " Both taxes are so excessive as to be confiscatory . " This is no new situation , A similar situation was developed in April , 1920 ; before the ' death of Carranza , valuations were iposed raising taxes to the same amo ? as the combined taxes proposed now . At that time the coiatenies protested against this injustice , and their protest was wanted . decided upon by means of a decree . Proper protests were again made and the proposed increase was abandoned . " Again in February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested and again abandoned . " The companies are confident that a showing of the irregularity of the decree and of its confiscatory nature , will result in its being revoked , or declared inoperative as on the three former occasions ! " One who has followed the Mexican political situation for years , as it effects American property rights in the southern republic , looks upon the latest manoeuver of Mexican Government in increasing export taxes on petroleum as a subterfuge to cover its confiscatory principle , " The whole step appears to me to be a monumental bluff on the part of the Mexican government and I do n't believe they feel they can get away with it . It would appear that the Mexicans are trying to get over their tax because of the possible import tax here on Mexican oil , " he declared . " Rat the principle behind the thing overshadows the amount of the tax . Mr. Hughes ' note told the Mexicans quite bluntly that their confiscatory measures must cease . Apparently Obregon is trying to do indirectly , by means of increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years  --  confiscate American property . Their chances for success may be guessed by the tone of Secretary Hughes ' note earlier in the week . "
