txt Our Missionaries In Turkey . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have worked with the Americans In Turkey thirty-four years , and was rescued from Smyrna as by America . Antranig Garabedian , a naturalized American citizen and university graduate , when acized by the Turks , showed his American citizenship papers in vein . As they dragged him from my side ho jumped into the sea and was shot before my eyes . Many others died the same way . I saw the Star-Spangled Banner work marvels in other scenes of ruin and bloodshed , and am convinced that America could have rescued Smyrna . A century ago American missionaries were welcomed by the Armenians because they are quick to respond to progress . It is not true that missionaries have meddled In national questions in Turkey . They have been noliticilly very circumspect , and sought the good of the Turks as well as of the Christiana . They have only told the outside world of the suffering in order to get help for the victims . The Near East Relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this quiet the conscience of the nation ? Can those who from partisan or commercial motives ang trying to prevent America from facing her duty as a member of the human family succeed ? ' Can they annihilate America 's Past service and her future moral influence in that land ? Can they tread under foot America 's Bible and silence American prayers ? CHRISTOPHER AKRTAVIAR . New York , Nov. 27 , 1922.
