txt Lehigh Valley Railroad , selling around 70 , really includes the stock of two companies . The railroad company pays $3.50 a year , and under the segregation plan the coal company , interest in which is shared by all railroad stockholders , earns enough tospay $2 or $3 annually Under segregation , the coal company stock is made available to railroad stockholders upon the-payment of $1 a share for each share of railroad stock helcL The market is placing a value on the coal company shares now of $33 each . This value-for the rights , subtracted from 70 , leaves 37 , the price at which the railroad stock is appraised in the market . In buying Lehigh Valley Railroad stock now , therefore , you have a stock the two parts of which together have prospective paying ability of $5.50 t3 $6.50 annually in the future . Paying $5.50 in dividends , these two stocks at a cost of $70 for one share of each would yield 7.8% on the investment .

RECEIVERS micter PAY TAX 26549 ? I am informed that it has been held that income of a corporation in the hands of a receiver who is acting solely as an officer of the court which appointed him is not taxable by the federal government ; also , that fee allowed the receiver by a state oourt is not taxable income . Will you please give your opinion on these two questions ? ? II . J. C. A receiver acts for the corporation which he operates , and must make return for the corporation on Form 1120 for the year or part of the year in which he is in control , and pay tax on the income of the corporation . He performs all the duties and assumes all the liabilities that devolve upon the officiers of the corporation , including of course , filing tax return of the corporation and paying the tax .

In 1921 a relative took losses amounting to ov , -r ? $100,000 in selling listed securities which had been held many years . The gross income that year was about 129,000 , so with the losses reported there was no income tar to pay . In 2922 the gross income wee about $34,000 , and in making income tax report I carried over balance of losses from 1921 and paid no tax . The Question has come up as to whether I had any right to carry over losses iron ; 1921 to 1922 . The law seems clear in permitting a corporation to carry net losses to the succeeding year , but I can find no reference as to this in connection with an individual . Can you advise inc as to this , whether was right or wrong ? Should , I file an amended return ? ? Q. C. No individual is permitted to carry over net bans from one year to another , except in the course of a regular , established business . Loss incurred in selling securities is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a . regular business , rather than incidental investment or speculation . From your statement of the case it would appear that you had no right to claim the 1921 loss against the 1922 income . If , however , speculation is the relative 's real business , and can be so showm , the 1921 loss can still be carried ? to 1923 account as a deduction from income . Such cases must be well established to get by . Following is the official ruling : " The taxpayer is not a member of a stock exchange , has no place of business . does not make purchases and sales of securities for others , but devotes the greirter part of his time in keeping in touch with the stock market and to giving orders to his broker for the purchase and sale of securities . lie has no other trade or business .
