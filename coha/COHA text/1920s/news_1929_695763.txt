txt Vaughan and I several hours ago returned here to our tent after a twenty-mile dogteam trip of exploration . We found Petersen and Balchen preparing our New Year 's dinner . Our meal consisted of pork and beans , bread and butter , peanut butter , and canned applesauce for dessert . Strange as it may seem , no feast of wine , turkey and cranberry sauce would have tasted any better , for , we were very hungry after our long journey over the snow ; and now we would not walk around the tent to get the best dish that Broadway produces . We drank the New Year in ' with several hot cups of tea . That is a great cold-weath ' drink and nothing could be more satisfying . Washes Dishes for New Year 's . The only New Year 's resolution I made was to wash the dishes for the night ; and now . we are sitting snug and comfortable , all- happy in our little four-man tent with the Eskimo dogs curled up outside , sleeping after a heavy meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to some predetermined signal , they all howl in unison , and then they go back to sleep again . We have a temporary radio antenna up with a bamboo mast stuck in the snow , and Petersen is sitting tapping away at the key , sending some instructions and New Year 's greetings to our shipmates on the City of . New York . and ; to the members of the expedition on the Eleanor Bolling in New Zealand . The radio is one of the things that at the moment impresses me . The wonder of the thing  --  that I can sit out here on this God-forsaken hunk of ice in a small tent giving instructions for operations to my shipmates , some of them 2,700 statute miles away ; and what a comforting thing it must be for those on the City of New York , who but for the radio would certainly be worried about us , since we disappeared several days ago over the ice into the haze that lies between us and the ship . Another thing which at the moment impresses me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist down here . We just stepped out of the tent and took a look around , and could not prevent a slight eerie sensation , due to the impossibility of judging wan the eye the distance or shapes of the snow-covered areas that surround us . Barrier Rises on Three Sides . This great hunk of ice , the Barrier , on . a low part of which we are encamped , arises to the north , east and south of us , in some places to about 200 feet . We appear to be in a kind of bowl ; but . it is impossible to tell how far away the rim of it is or where or how the valley to the westward , through which we came , meets and merges into the Barrier . The few vague lines that can ' be seen might be several feet away , or miles away . We glide over the surface with our skiis , and all of a sudden stumble over a little upward slope that it is impossible to see , and when we reach a depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . All of this happens in broad daylight , because of course it is nearly as light at midnight here as it is in midday . We see in the distance a mountain of snow apparently miies off ; but in a few minutes we reach this mountain and find it is a snow haycock no higher than our chin . Again we see a pressure ridge appearing close aboard , but find it miles off . No one of us who has been in the Arctic has experienced exactly this kind of thing , and even the Norwegians who have lived In the snow are remarking about it . Visibility Good in the Sun . But the weather is not always like this . The sun has shone once or twice and visibility is then remarkably good . At such times one is impressed with the extraordinary forces that nature exerts down herer Great massive blocks ? of ice are shoved up on the ice barrier , an immovable area of ( what must be ) land-locked ice , holding hundreds of miles of water-bourne ice carried by wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , which is about fifteen miles square , is crisscrossed with great blocks of pressure-ridge ice , which are forced up by wind and tide as the edge of the frozen bay is held by the high snow cliffs of the barrier . There is no land whatever in sight , only the snow-covered surface of the bay and the ice barrier and the greenish-blue ice of the barrier walls . The barrier is sub-permanent , but the bay ice shifts out in the Summer ; and we are now anxiously awaiting for this to happen so that we can more readily get our supplies to our base . Have " Put Something on the Maps . " Vaughan and I feel that our New Year 's Eve journey has not been fruitless , for we have been able to put something on the maps of the school children . We have found that , since the Bay of Whales was for the first and last time surveyed and explored seventeen years ago , there have been some changes , one of which was the formation , on the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a harbor about two miles wide and seven miles deep . This harbor , of course , is covered with ice and snow . One of our jobs will be to get an exact survey of it . A third thing that impresses me at this moment isas to my stout-hearted comrades , who keep cheerful and high spirited ' regardless of labors and hardships . It can be nothing but a joy to go on the trail with such men , and those who have not had this experience are in a way unfortunate . It is good to get away from telephones , correspondents , city noises and the hectic rush of life as it is nowadays . We are well content for the time to live our life down here and let civilization toddle by . Has Highest Praise for Dogs . I come back again to the dogs . I admire them even more if possible than I have formerly . On our New Year 's sled jaunt , our leader , Terror , pulled until he could hardly stand any more . We put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now he has the special privilege of being permitted to curl up in the tent after a big feed . Tomorrow he will be as good as new , what with the extraordinary come-back these Eskimo dogs have . Several days ago one of the dogs was taken with very bad cramps in his legs so that he could not stand up . When we hitched up the team he staggered to the harness and fell in his place alongside the team . In spite - of " hell and high water " he wanted to do his bit . At times they are great rascals . They are , I believe , the most pugnacious creatures living as far as their own kind are concerned . They like nothing more than a good fight . Frequently the harness and lines are all messed up while on the trail by a battle in which all of the seven dogs take part . And as they are likely to injure each other severely , it is necessary to stop them at once ; and , believe me , the drivers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a light load after a good night 's rest , they are so full of pep that it is impossible to hold them down and prevent them from dashing over rough ice , upsetting the sled . Much Colder Than in Arctic . Strange as it may seem , they appear to love to get into their harness , where they do such grueling work they do not mind the cold ; nor do we , as our skin clothing keeps us warm . It is on an average about fifteen or twenty degrees colder down here than it is in the Arctic . We are now going to turn into our reindeer-skin sleeping bags and , after a little sleep , Vaughan and I will return to the ship and bring back six dog teams fully loaded to start the laying of the permanent base , which will be about 200 yards from this tent upon the ice barrier . The ice is way out in the bay this year and our work is going to be slow and difficult , but it has got to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel safely to our main base . Safety of the personnel comes first , and the elements down here are so capricious that it is very unwise to rush things , so we propose to go as surely as possible even though our progress may be slower . The three men of the expedition accompanying Commander Byrd on the dog-team exploring trip are Norman D. Vaughan , dog driver ; Carl 0 . Petersen , radio man , and Bernt Balchen , aviator.
