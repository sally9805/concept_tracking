SCENE : A Cloud . JUPITER , the master of the gods , and MERCURY , his half-son , are lounging on a cloud , their phosphorescent eyes focused for the moment on the domesticities of a terrestrial couple . JUPITER ( Peering straight out ) There she is , Mercury  --  there she is ! MERCURY Where , Jupiter , where ? JUPITER You see that lighted window , the one with the curtain stirring in the breeze ? She 's there . Alkmena is there ! No , now she 's gone ! Do n't move , do n't move  --  in a second perhaps , you will see her shadow pass again . MERCURY Jupiter , you astonish me . If you 're in love with this mortal , why do n't you employ the facilities you have as a god ? Why waste an entire night , ravished with longing , bouncing about on a cloud , catching at her shadow when you might so easily , with your ordinary god-sight , see her as she is through the walls of her chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , enfold her in a closeness she could not feel ? MERCURY But the wind makes love like that , Jupiter , and the wind is as much as you are , one of the prime elements of fecundity . JUPITER True , but with her , Mercury , I am tempted to transcend my former conquests . I have a nostalgia for mortality . I would like to experience the same difficulties human beings do  --  and the same delights . As a god , I feel I should be closer to my subjects ! MERCURY Oh , but love-making among human beings is such a boring routine ! JUPITER Oh , you think so , do you ? MERCURY Yes . To begin with , you must woo her  --  then you must undress her  --  then you must dress her again . And to get rid of her you must actively antagonize her ,  --  it 's a full time job ! JUPITER Yes , it 's true that the rituals and conventions of earthly love-making are complicated  --  but strangely enough , it is their strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . First you must follow her  --  JUPITER Measuring your pace exactly to hers so that both your legs seem to swing from the same fulcrum  --  MERCURY ( Rather bored , succumbing to the rhythm of a well-worn formula ) p. 3 Identifying in both your bodies the ultimate source of all impulse and all rhythm . JUPITER Then  --  with a bound , you are at her side  --  MERCURY With your left hand you descend on her breasts  --  JUPITER With your right hand you cover her eyelids  --  the most sensitive part of a woman 's skin  --  So that she may divine from the heat of your palm , your ardor  --  JUPITER And from the lines of your palm , your ultimate destiny , your mortal future and your grievous death . So that pity will stir in her as well as desire  --  JUPITER AND MERCURY ( Together ) For in the conquest of a woman  --  the one is as important as the other  --  JUPITER Acquiescent at last  --  you undo her girdle  --  MERCURY AND JUPITER ( Together  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and so forth  --  JUPITER And then what do you do ? MERCURY And then what do I do ? JUPITER Yes . What do you feel ? MERCURY What do I feel ? Nothing ! Nothing special . In fact it 's exactly like being with Venus ! JUPITER Why then do you bother to go to Earth at all ? MERCURY Out of boredom . And I confess that for a brief sojourn the Earth has certain advantages . What with its moist atmosphere and its green lawns it is perhaps the pleasantest planet on which to alight  --  but only for a brief stay  --  because it has distance drawbacks . Due to its heavy mineral and oil deposits , it gives off a heady odor . It is , in fact , the only star which smells exactly like a wild animal . JUPITER Look at that curtain  --  look quickly ! MERCURY Her shadow  --  JUPITER No. no . Not yet her shadow . What you see now is but the of her shadow . MERCURY ( Peering intently ) p. 4 Well , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw-bridge . There are two people there-interlaced like a vine-motif in a frieze . It 's not your unborn son , Jupiter , that makes that shadow so grossly convex but simply  --  her husband . ( In amazement ) Why , he 's a giant ! Look ; he approaches her again  --  he embraces her again  --  he 's insatiable ! JUPITER Yes . Amphitryon , her only love . MERCURY Now , I begin to see why you are willing to forego your celestial eyesight . To observe merely a shadow-husband embracing a shadow wife is less painful than to observe the living substance . ( Short pause ) Now the shadow has disappeared ! JUPITER Doubtless , overcome , she has sunk down and abandons herself to blissful languor  --  drinking in the songs of the ravished nightingales . Oh , happy , happy nightingales ! MERCURY Ravished nightingales ! Jupiter , you know perfectly well that as far as women are concerned these little birds are quite disinterested . In love affairs the nightingales are nothing but obligato . It 's for that reason you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several occasions you 've had to do a bull  --  but never a nightingale ! No , it 's not the birds you have to worry about  --  it 's the husband  --  the husband of this dark , lusty beauty ! JUPITER ( Quickly ) p. 5 How do you know she 's dark ? Are you inventing , or are you spying ? MERCURY I confess a moment ago , while she was in her bath , I renamed for a fleeting instant my celestial vision . Do n't be an  --  now I see no more than you do . JUPITER you 're lying ! I can tell it from your face . You 're looking at her . You see her . I can see a glow on your face that comes only from the phosphorescence of a woman . MERCURY I confess  --  I am looking at her . JUPITER Well , what 's she doing ? MERCURY She is leaning over the relaxed Amphitryon . She 's laughing . She holds Amphitryon 's head in her hands as if she were weighing it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her kisses made it too heavy to hold . Now she is facing us squarely  --  Yes  --  she is indubitably  --  dark ! JUPITER And her husband ? MERCURY Quite dark . His nipples apricot  --  JUPITER I 'm not interested in his color scheme . What is he doing ? MERCURY He polishes her with his hand as one would a favorite pony . He 's a celebrated horseman , you know . JUPITER And Alkmena ? MERCURY Oh , so gay  --  so docile  --  so faithful . JUPITER Faithful to herself or faithful to her husband  --  that is the question . You know , Mercury , most faithful wives are unfaithful to their husbands with everything except men ; with jewels  --  with perfumes  --  with reading  --  with religion and with the contemplation of Spring , with everything in fact , except a man . Do n't you think these faithful wives deserve some compensation ? MERCURY But Alkmena is faithful only to her husband ! Jupiter , by what subterfuge can you make her yours ? JUPITER The difficulty with these virtuous wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may be seduced confidentially ! And the contemplation of this creature paralyzes my invention . What do you suggest , Mercury ? MERCURY Functioning as a human being or functioning as a god ? JUPITER How would the methods differ ? MERCURY Well , functioning as a god  --  very simple . You lift her to our plane  --  you make her comfortable on a cloud  --  for the required seconds you let her bear a hero 's weight  --  and then  --  let her resume her own . JUPITER But by following that course I should forego the most exquisite sensation to be had from the love of a woman . MERCURY Which most exquisite sensation ? There are several . JUPITER The moment of consent . But with Alkmena that 's imposible because she loves only her husband . MERCURY Well , then  --  be her husband ! JUPITER But he 's never out of her sight ! The most persistent stay-at-homes in the world are heroes out-of-work ! They 're more domestic than tigers ! MERCURY Then employ him . Fortunately there is an infallible recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MERCURY Have Thebes declare war . JUPITER But Thebes is at peace with her enemies . MERCURY Then have her declare war against a friend . What are friendly powers for if they ca n't have a little squabble now and then ? JUPITER Is n't it singular , Mercury , you and I are gods and yet to achieve human simplicity becomes for us the most devious exercise in style . While we are on Earth fate demands far more of us than she does of mortals . To obtain from Alkmena this exquisite consent  --  which the most grotesque of human beings can gain by making a few faces  --  we have to contrive innumerable stratagems , perform wonders , pile up miracles  --  MERCURY Well , contrive them ! Pile them up ! JUPITER How ? How ? MERCURY Have a warrior overcome by an uncontrollable impulse to exercise his profession . Instantly Amphitryon will fly off to head his army . JUPITER Of course ! MERCURY The minute he is gone  --  assume his appearance  --  assign to me the exterior of his servant Sosie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Amphitryon has only made a pretense of departing  --  that actually he means to return  --  to spend the night with her . JUPITER ( With admiration ) p. 6 Oh , Mercury , you are your father 's son ! MERCURY Let us go  --  let us descend . Order a special cloud , Jupiter , to conceal us . JUPITER That 's hardly necessary , Mercury . For there , on Earth , they have an institution which renders them invisible to creditors , to the jealous  --  which gives them surcease from their little nervous cares  --  a great and democratic institution  --  the only one  --  I may add  --  which is even moderately successful  --  MERCURY What is that , Jupiter ? JUPITER The night ! ( The curtains close in and the lights fade as the music swells. ) @x SCENE : The faade and terrace of AMPHITRYON 'S palace in Thebes . Four rectangular steps . At top of fourth step is an iron grille gate . More steps from gate up to portico of Palace . The gate is open . TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SOSIE enters from palace with scroll . SOSIE Are you the Trumpeter of the day ? TRUMPETER If I may make so bold , yes . And you , who are you , may I ask ? You look like someone I know . SOSIE ( Importantly ) I doubt it very much . I am Sosie . I am the servant , Official Announcer and Scribe to General Amphitryon . I am unique . TRUMPETER ( Humbly ) I must be mistaken . SOSIE What are you waiting for ? If you are the Trumpeter of the day , why do n't you trumpet ? TRUMPETER But , may I make so bold , your announcement ? What does it announce ? SOSIE You 'll find out . TRUMPETER Is it Lost and Found ? Has someone lost something ? SOSIE On the contrary ! Something has been found . Blow , I tell you . p. 8 TRUMPETER ( Sits comfortably on top step ) It 's easy to say blow but how can I blow when I do n't know what it is I 'm blowing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same note anyway . TRUMPETER ( With dignity ) It is true my instrument has only one note but as for me personally I have many . For I am a composer . I compose hymns . SOSIE I bet your hymns have only one note . Hurry up , there 's a good fellow , and blow . There 's Orion in the sky already ! TRUMPETER ( Placidly ) Orion may be in the sky but that does not alter the fact that as a creative artist I have to know what it is you expect me to blow about . If I have attained any celebrity among the one-note trumpeters it is because , before blowing , I compose in my mind a whole musical composition of which the last note is invariably the one I blow . That note is the climax . That is why , when I do come to blow it , it has such surprise , such brilliance , such finality . The climax may be always the same but the approach  --  ah !  --  the approach ! SOSIE I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole town 's falling asleep ! p. 9 TRUMPETER The town may be falling asleep , but I must just stop to tell you that my colleagues , in fact all trumpeters , are consumed with jealousy of me . You can see why  --  because none of them are composers . They tell me that in the trumpet-schools they have instituted , thanks to my example , a course , teaching the trumpeters not to blow , indeed , but how to perfect the silence that precedes the blowing . Now you can see , I am sure , how important it is for me to know what it is I 'm blowing for . First , I have to compose a silent air and how can I do that if I do n't know whether I 'm blowing for war or for peace , for Lost and Found or for marriage , or birth or death . I 've got to know , that 's all ! SOSIE Well then it 's for peace . TRUMPETER What peace ? SOSIE At least what passes for peace  --  the breathing-speel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOSIE For peace ! TRUMPETER It has been my observation that a martial air is irresistible no matter what the cause . I myself , pacific nature though I am , when I hear a military-band , feel truculent . I ca n't help it . Shall I do something of the sort for peace ? SOSIE If it 's not misleading ? p. 10 TRUMPETER Leave it to me ! ( The TRUMPETER lifts his instrument to his lips , weaving meanwhile with his free hand a stirring , military air . SOSIE interrupts impatiently . ) SOSIE Do n't be too warlike ! TRUMPETER ( Patiently regretful ) Now I have to begin all over again . ( He repeats the business and blows his one note . Magnanimously ) Now you may deliver . SOSIE ( Declaiming ) The General Amphitryon has bade me address you on the subject of Peace.I do n't see a single light down there . I 'm afraid your wonderful trumpet did n't carry far ! TRUMPETER Ah ! But they heard my silent song  --  it entered their ears insensibly  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , Thebans ! The General Amphitryon , whose war proclamations have so often stirred you , has asked me to deliver you a peace proclamation . Instead of rousing you from your beds it is intended to lull you to a deeper sleep . Is it not good to sleep in a fatherland unscarred by the trenches of war , among friendly birds and dogs and cats , among rats whose appetites have never been whetted by the taste of human flesh ? Is it not good to wear your national countenance , not as a mask to frighten those who have n't the same blood-count you have but as an oval mirror to reflect smiling and laughter ? Thebans , sleep ! p. 11 TRUMPETER That 's good ! That 's very good ! Did General Amphitryon write that ? SOSIE General Amphitryon is too busy to write ! I am his scribe . I wrote it . TRUMPETER Did he give you the ideas ? SOSIE He simply said : Deliver them a Peace Proclamation . They 're my own ideas ! TRUMPETER Nevertheless , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thebans ! You may sleep ! What more lovely array than your unarmed and naked bodies , flat on your backs , arms out-stretched with nothing heavier to worry about than your navels.Never has there been a night so transfigured , so fragrant , so serenesleep ! sleep ! sleep ! TRUMPETER ( Made sleepy by the cadence ) I 'd like to take a nap myself . SOSIE Now , then , Thebans ! ( He pulls out a scroll and reads from it ) The General Amphitryon has ordered me to read you , instead of a War Bulletin  --  a Peace Bulletin . Listen : Between the Issus and its tributary we have taken an important prisoner , a roebuck wandered from Thrace . Around Mount Olympus , by dint of skillful maneuvering , we have coaxed the arid plains into a fine green sward which presently will blossom into wheat ! The syringas we have caused to be lanced by great swarms of bees . On the shores of the Aegean there is nothing , neither in the expanse of the waves nor in the vista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the mysterious distances that separate the temples from the firmament , the trees from the houses , animals from men , we have ambushed a thousand secret signals which our wise men will be centuries in decipheringwe are menaced , Thebans , by centuries of peace.Cursed be war ! Cursed be war ! Cursed be war ! ( The WARRIOR enters ) p. 12 TRUMPETER ( Murmuring sympathetically out of his drowse ) Cursed be war ! WARRIOR ( Fiercely ) What is that you say ? SOSIE ( Frightened ) I repeat what I have just said : " A curse on war ! " WARRIOR Do you know to whom you are saying this ? SOSIE I do not . WARRIOR To a professional warrior . TRUMPETER ( Fully awake now ) Ah ! Now we 'll get a different point of view ! SOSIE Well , there are wars and wars ! WARRIOR Not to a warrior . Where is your master ? SOSIE There  --  in his bedroom  --  where the light is burning . WARRIOR Bring your master this message instantly . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . WARRIOR Take him the message at once ! It 's war ! SOSIE But from everywhere resounds that murmur which old men call the echo of peace ! p. 13 WARRIOR And that , my friend , is just the moment for me ! SOSIE War ! Again ! TRUMPETER What do you mean again ? Still ! WARRIOR The Athenians have mobilized their troops and crossed the frontier . SOSIE You lie ! The Athenians are our allies ! WARRIOR Then it is our allies who are invading us  --  wake up Amphitryon . Do you hear ? Go ! ( SOSIE exits into the palace . ) WARRIOR ( To the TRUMPETER who starts to follow SOSIE ) You stay here ! Blow your trumpet ! TRUMPETER What is the subject on which you wish me to blow ? WARRIOR War ! TRUMPETER But which aspect of war ? Do you wish me to emphasize its sublime side or its pathetic side ? WARRIOR Neither . I want you to emphasize its appeal to Youth . ( The TRUMPETER composes and blows . The WARRIOR leans over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you who are vital , whose bodies are strong and unblemished , segregate yourselves from the sweating mass spawning there in the darkness . Get up ! To arms ! p. 14 TRUMPETER Some of those lazy people would rather spawn ! They 're very weak . WARRIOR ( Continues his harangue ) You who are poor , all of you whom fortune has treated badly , war will restore your rights . And you rich come and experience the final ecstasy  --  the ecstasy of the gambler who risks his position , his pleasures , his mistresses , on one turn of the wheel . You zealots , you prayerful ones , make Nationalism your religion . And you atheists and sensualists , war is your paradise for it legalizes all your excesses  --  you may whet your swords on the statues of the gods themselves . You who hate work  --  to the trenches  --  war is the heaven of the lazy . And for you who are industrious  --  we have the Commissariat ! TRUMPETER There 's something in what he says  --  jobs for everybody ! WARRIOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the glory of dying valiantly for one 's country the inglorious destiny of staying at home overfed , lethargic and slothful ? TRUMPETER I do . WARRIOR Besides , Citizens , there is nothing really to be afraid of . I may tell you this in confidence : in this war , on our side at least , there will be no fatalities whatever , and moreover , whatever wounds there are will be in the left hand  --  except among the left-handed . No more petty squabbles  --  war unites us ! And how humane it is , for it abolishes the barbaric duel ! Here she is  --  your war , ready for you , eager to welcome you . War ! Welcome ! I salute you ! War ! It 's begun already . See the lights down there . Citizens  --  to arms ! ( He comes down the steps hurriedly shouting as he goes ) You may pick your laws , your pleasures , your women  --  Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , War  --  ( He rushes across the stage shouting slogans ) Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His voice trails off as he disappears , SOSIE enters from the palace. ) p. 15 TRUMPETER ( To SOSIE ) Your master is ready ? SOSIE He is ready . It is my mistress who is n't quite ready . It takes no time at all to dress for going to war , but to dress for saying farewell takes longer . TRUMPETER Is she one of those weeping women ? SOSIE Unfortunately one of the smiling ones . The weeping ones regain their composure more quickly than the smiling ones . TRUMPETER ( Shrugs his shoulders philosophically , then looks down on the city below ) They 're getting up all right . Look at those lights ! ( He rises and starts coming down the steps ) He 'll get ' em . ( He crosses the stage ruminating out loud ) They could sleep in peace but they 'd rather get up and fight . They like it . They want it . Well , if that 's what they want they can have it . ( He goes out dejectedly . SOSIE comes down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have this happen on the very day that Peace is proclaimed ! ( He goes out . AMPHITRYON enters from palace , in full war regalia . He goes to end of platform , scans the horizon and starts down steps . ALKMENA enters from the palace. ) p. 16 ALKMENA Amphitryon ! I love you  --  ( AMPHITRYON quickly goes up steps , embraces her and kisses her . ) AMPHITRYON I love you , Alkmena . ALKMENA Will you think of me while you 're away ? Do you promise it ? AMPHITRYON Yes , darling . ( Looks away . ) ALKMENA Why do you turn to the moon ? I 'm jealous of the moon  --  that blank surface  --  what thoughts do you get from her ? AMPHITRYON And from your dark head  --  what ? ALKMENA A scent at least  --  twin brother of memory . Oh , you 're shaved ! Do they shave now to go to war ? Do you think with your skin pumiced like that , you 'll be more formidable ? AMPHITRYON Oh , no , darling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALKMENA Put your helmet on . Let me see you as your enemy sees you . AMPHITRYON Now do n't be frightened ! ( Puts helmet on . ) ALKMENA Not very frightening  --  not when those eyes are your eyes . AMPHITRYON But to my enemy it is , I assure you . p. 17 ALKMENA What are your greaves made of ? AMPHITRYON Silver  --  chased in platinum . ALKMENA Are n't they too tight for you ? Would n't steel ones be more flexible for running ? AMPHITRYON My dear , I 'm a general in command  --  and generals in command never run . ( Horses ' hoofs heard off stage . ) ALKMENA Your horses , your horses are here . Kiss me . AMPHITRYON No , no , my horses have quite a different gait  --  but that 's no reason why I ca n't kiss you . ( They kiss . ) ALKMENA Is your helmet silver , too ? AMPHITRYON The purest . ALKMENA What color tunic are you wearing beneath your armor ? AMPHITRYON Rose-pink  --  edged with black braid . ALKMENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your war !  --  Rose-pink  --  black braid . Does that help you to achieve your victories , or do you win them in one headlong charge , my name on your lips ? AMPHITRYON No , darling , it is n't that way . p. 18 ALKMENA How do you do it then ? AMPHITRYON Well , first of all I surround their left wing with my right wing , then I divide their right wing  --  using only three-quarters of my left wing  --  and then with the remaining quarter of my left wing I dart in among them  --  ALKMENA I see . A kind of battle of the birds . AMPHITRYON  --  and that gives me the victory . ALKMENA How many victories have you won , dearest one ? AMPHITRYON One , just one . ALKMENA Well , tell me , Amphitryon , have you killed many men ? AMPHITRYON One , only one . ALKMENA How economical you are , dear . Was he a king ? Was he a general ? AMPHITRYON No , he was a simple soldier . ALKMENA So modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , did you , in the process of his destruction , did you allow him one instant in which to recognize you and be aware of the distinction you had just conferred on him ? Did you , sweetheart ? AMPHITRYON Yes , I did . Blood pouring out of his mouth , he looked up at me and managed , with his last breath , a faint , respectful smile . p. 19 ALKMENA He must have been very happy ! Did he tell you his name before he died ? AMPHITRYON He was an anonymous soldier  --  there are quite a few of them . ALKMENA I see ! You know , darling , when you breathe your armor loosens at the fastenings , and your tunic gives your skin a tint of dawn . Breathe , Amphitryon , breathe  --  deeply  --  and let me savor , in the darkness of this night , the glow of your body . Stay a little longer . ( Presses closely to him ) Do you love me ? AMPHITRYON Yes . I have to wait for my horses anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 'll hurt yourself . You know I 'm a husband made of iron . ALKMENA Can you feel me  --  through all that armor ? AMPHITRYON Through every chink where an arrow might reach me , you reach me . And you  --  do you feel me ? ALKMENA Yes  --  but your own body is a kind of armor . Often I have lain in your arms and felt you remoter and colder than I do now . AMPHITRYON Alkmena , often I have held you close to me , and felt you sadder and more desolate than I feel you today . And yet , on those occasions I was departing not for the war but for the hunt . ( ALKMENA smiles ) Now , why do you smile ? Do you find consolation in this sudden declaration of war ? p. 20 ALKMENA Did you hear a child crying beneath our window a little while ago ? Did n't that seem to you to be a premonition of evil ? AMPHITRYON No , no , no . Omens are always announced with a thunder-clap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning . ALKMENA The sky was clear and yet the child was crying . That seemed to me to be even a worse augury . AMPHITRYON Do n't be superstitious , Alkmena . ALKMENA Something was hovering over our happiness . Praise be to the gods it was only war . AMPHITRYON Why do you say that  --  only war ? ALKMENA I was afraid it was our love that might be threatened  --  it 's there I feel the danger . I almost find consolation in war . At least , it 's a tangible and visible antagonist . I like eneies whose weapons I can see  --  my great fear has always been that I would one day find you in the arms of other women . AMPHITRYON Other women ! ALKMENA One or a thousand  --  what difference does it make ? You 'd be lost . AMPHITRYON You are the most beautiful woman in all Thebes . ALKMENA It 's the goddesses I 'm afraid of  --  and those foreigners . p. 21 AMPHITRYON You 're not serious . Above all  --  I fear the goddesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pearly without powder  --  their breasts whiter than snow and their arms stronger than crowbars , it must be very difficult to resist them . Do n't you think so ? AMPHITRYON For anyone but me it might be  --  yes . ALKMENA But they 're very sensitive , they take offense at very little , and they like to be loved . You 've never loved a goddess , have you ? AMPHITRYON Certainly not . ALKMENA No goddess has ever loved you ? AMPHITRYON No . ALKMENA Not a little tiny bit ? AMPHITRYON No ! And what 's more , I never loved a foreigner , either . ALKMENA They 've loved you . AMPHITRYON Oh , no , they have n't . ALKMENA Oh , yes , they have . AMPHITRYON Oh , but they have not , dear . ALKMENA Oh , they love every married man , these women . When they arrive in our cities everything is over for us , the stay-at-homes . Even the ugly ones , they flaunt their ugliness because after all it 's a foreign ugliness and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to themselves they are foreign . Compared to a threat like that war comes as a friend . You wo n't be killed , will you ? Generals in command are never killed . You will come back . p. 22 AMPHITRYON I 'll be back very soon , and that will be forever . ( They kiss . ) ALKMENA Look ! The stars are twinkling harder than ever . It is their last chance before dawn and our parting . Which one of them shall we choose to fix our eyes on tomorrow and every night at this same hour ? AMPHITRYON Well , there 's always our old friend Venus ! ALKMENA I do n't trust her . As an intermediary in love she might turn out to be not quite so disinterested . No , that side of my life I 'd rather look after personally . AMPHITRYON What about Jupiter ? There 's a good solid name ! ALKMENA I 'd rather have a star that has no name . AMPHITRYON What about that little one over there that 's called anonymous star . ALKMENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Horses ' hoofs heard . ) AMPHITRYON This time it 's they  --  I must go . ( Starts down steps . ) ALKMENA Who are " they " ? Your ambition , your pride as a commander , your love for carnage and adventure ? AMPHITRYON No , no . Just Elaphocephale and Hypsipila , my horses . p. 23 ALKMENA ( Comes down steps ) Go then if you must . AMPHITRYON Is that all you have to say to me ? ALKMENA Have n't I said about everything ? What do other wives say ? AMPHITRYON Well  --  they make jokes . They hand you your shield and they say things like " Return on it or beneath it ! " They cry out after you , " Fear nothing , " " Do or die ! " Can it be that my wife has no gift for epigrams like that ? ALKMENA I 'm afraid not . I could n't utter a phrase that belonged more to posterity than it did to you . The only words that I can find to utter are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you , Amphitryon ! Come back soon , Amphitryon ! Besides , your name is so long , once you 've said it there 's hardly breath left to follow it up with an immortal sentence . ( SOSIE enters with AMPHITRYON 'S spear and shield . ) AMPHITRYON Then say my name at the end . ( Takes spear and shield from SOSIE and lifts his right arm in a salute ) Good-bye , Alkmena ! ( Exits , followed by SOSIE . ) ALKMENA Amphitryon ! ( For a moment she stands still . Then the sound of horses ' hoofs is heard starting and then gradually diminishing in the distance . ALKMENA , on the verge of sobbing , turns away . MERCURY , disguised as SOSIE , enters and stands below gate . ALKMENA turns to gate , looks at MERCURY in amazement , knowing that SOSIE had just gone off , laughs nervously and looks at him again . MERCURY gives her the keys to the gate ; she closes gate but does not lock it and starts up steps. ) p. 24 ALKMENA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MERCURY Alkmena , my lady Alkmena  --  ALKMENA What is it , Sosie ? MERCURY I have a message for you from my master . ALKMENA From your master ? Your master is still within earshot . MERCURY Exactly , my lady . No one must hear . My master has instructed me to inform you that he is only pretending to leave with the army , that actually he means to return to spend this night with you , once he 's given his orders . ALKMENA I do n't understand you , Sosie . ( Goes up another step . ) MERCURY ( Repeating mechanically ) My master has instructed me to inform you that  --  ALKMENA How dull you are , Sosie ! Do n't you understand the first principle of keeping a secret  --  which is to pretend the moment you 've heard it  --  the moment you 've grasped it  --  not to know a thing about it ? MERCURY Very good , my lady . ALKMENA As a matter of fact I have n't understood one word you 've been saying . p. 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my lady . ALKMENA Yes , yes , Sosie . Stop chattering . ( Goes up the rest of the steps ) Is n't the wind blowing your tongue about ? ( Exits into palace . MERCURY looks up at the sky above him and guardedly whispers hoarsely . ) MERCURY Jupiter ! Jupiter ! ( Motions with his thumb that ALKMENA is inside waiting . There is a terrific crash offstage . MERCURY rushes off . JUPITER enters dressed exactly as AMPHITRYON , carrying shield and spear . MERCURY follows JUPITER . ) MERCURY Are you all right ? JUPITER Yes . I forgot the law of gravity . ( JUPITER boldly starts toward gate . ) MERCURY Where are you going ? JUPITER I 'm going in ! MERCURY You ca n't do that . JUPITER Why not ? I 've copied his costume down to the last detail . MERCURY There 's an element here that goes beyond costume . Look at you ! You 've just emerged from the brambles and there is n't a scratch on you ! And no creases ! Even clothes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Turn around . ( Takes shield and spear from JUPITER and puts them down. ) p. 26 JUPITER What ? MERCURY Turn around ! JUPITER Gods never turn around . MERCURY But I must see your back ! JUPITER Why ? MERCURY Men think that women never notice their backs . They are unaware that although they pretend to be overcome by their magnificent padded chests , they are actually maliciously scrutinizing the back view . It 's from the back that women estimate a man . ( JUPITER turns his back to him ) That 's better . Your entire body must be faultless . Come here , so I can adjust your human uniform , also . ( JUPITER takes off his helmet and gives it to MERCURY . ) JUPITER Mercury , are n't my eyes good ? MERCURY No , they 're far too brilliant all iris and no tear duct . You may have to cry , you know . ( JUPITER begins to cry . MERCURY snaps fingers ) There , there . ( Straightens JUPITER up ) Tell me , on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't remember . Oh , you mean pupils  --  like this ? ( Looks at MERCURY in a strange manner. ) p. 27 MERCURY ( Cowering ) No phosphorescence ! ( No cat 's eyes , please ! ( JUPITER assumes his natural look ) There , that 's better . Now , about your skin . ( Puts helmet down next to shield and spear . ) JUPITER What 's wrong with my skin ? ( Looking at his hands . ) MERCURY It 's a baby 's skin . To begin with we must have a weather-beaten skin  --  a skin on which the wind has blown for thirty years . In short , a well-seasoned skin  --  a skin that may be tasted . For tasted it will be . Did n't they complain , these other women of yours when they found your skin had a baby 's taste ? JUPITER No , no ,  --  I do n't think so . MERCURY With that skin you 'd never be allowed a second visit here . And now , Jupiter , please be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have encased yourself . It 's too big for you , you 're floating in it . JUPITER It 's true . MERCURY Contract ! ( Makes a gesture as with a rapier thrust . ) JUPITER ( Flexing muscles in arms until he achieves the position of Christ on the Cross ) It cramps me ! I feel my heart beating against it . My veins bursting ! My arteries distending ! I feel myself becoming a filter  --  an hour-glass of blood ! The birth of all humanity strains inside me  --  beating me black and blue ! I hope that all my poor human beings do n't suffer like this ! p. 28 MERCURY Twice they do  --  once when they 're born and once when they die . JUPITER ( Straightens up ) How very disagreeable to experience both simultaneously . MERCURY You do not lessen the torture by dividing the process . JUPITER Tell me , Mercury , as you stand before me , do you get the impression that you are standing before a man ? MERCURY ( Eyeing him over ) No , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when I stand before the living body of a man is that he is constantly undergoing change  --  disintegration  --  and that he incessantly ages . And as I watch the light in his eyes , I see it with the flying instants incessantly growing dimmer and dimmer . JUPITER Let 's try ! MERCURY What are you going to do ? JUPITER ( Begins to stoop like an old man ) I 'm saying to myself : " I 'm going to die I 'm going to die . " MERCURY No , not so fast you 're aging prematurely . Slow the tempo ! You 're living at the scale at which a dog lives or a car . p. 29 JUPITER ( Straightens up a little and extends his arm to MERCURY ) How 's this ? ( Breathes slower , like a fish . ) MERCURY ( Puts his arms , one above and one underneath JUPITER 'S arm ) No . Now your hearbeats are too widely spaced . You 're living now at fish rhythm . You 're not , Jupiter , please to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is straight ) There that 's it that 's it . Keep up that little half-way gallop between the dogs and the fishes . It 's this little ambling inner rhythm by which Amphitryon recognizes his horses , and Alkmena the heartbeats of her husband . ( JUPITER looks out front ) What are you thinking ? JUPITER That I want to be loved for myself alone . I shall make Alkmena accept a lover ! MERCURY Alkmena , I 'm very much afraid , will deny you that pleasure . You better stick to being her husband . JUPITER Her husband  --  and her lover . No woman could resist that . We 'll begin that way and later on  --  we shall see  --  we shall see  --  ( Starts to go but MERCURY raises hand and stops him ) Any last minute instructions ? p. 30 MERCURY Yes . About your intellect . JUPITER What 's wrong with my intellect ? MERCURY We must replace all your god-like conceptions with human ones . What are your beliefs ? Recite to me your man 's idea of the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of this universe ? I believe that this flat Earth is flat ; ( MERCURY picks up helmet gives it to JUPITER , who puts it on ) I believe that water is water and nothing else ; ( MERCURY picks up shield and hands it to JUPITER ) I believe that air is simple and indivisible ; I believe that nature is nature  --  ( MERCURY picks up spear and hands it to JUPITER ) and the spirit  --  well , the spirit  --  In fact , I believe that there is nothing beyond what I can see , and beyond what I can understand . Is that all ? MERCURY Not quite . Are you consumed by a desire to part your hair in the middle and keep it set that way unalterably with sticky hair lotion ? JUPITER I feel that temptation  --  passionately ! MERCURY Good ! Do you conceive that one day you may die ? JUPITER That I may die ? No , never ! That my poor friends may die , alas , yes , my poor friends  --  but not I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women you 've already loved ? JUPITER I 've never loved anyone but Alkmena . MERCURY And this sky over us  --  what do you think of this sky ? JUPITER I believe that the sky is my own personal property . I believe that I possess it far more than I ever did before . MERCURY Oh , Jupiter ! JUPITER And as for the whole solar system , it seems to me very small ! MERCURY And the whole vast Earth ? JUPITER Very small ! And , Mercury I feel handsomer than Apollo ! Braver than Mars more capable of amorous exploits than  --  myself . And for the first time , Mercury , I really feel myself , I really see myself , I really believe myself , to be master of the gods ! MERCURY Well , you 're a man all right . Get on with it . ( The light in the palace goes out . JUPITER makes a motion of knocking on gate , without touching it and there is an accompanying metallic knock heard . There is no reply from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate from where he stands. ) p. 32 JUPITER I know she 's there . MERCURY How do you know ? JUPITER She was looking from her window as I came down . MERCURY You do n't think she recognized you ? JUPITER No . She thought I was a falling star and wished on me ! MERCURY You 'd better try again . ( JUPITER again makes the motion of knocking on gate and once more the accompanying metallic knock is heard . MERCURY waits until he hears ALKMENA 'S voice then stealthily exits . ) ALKMENA ( Off stage ; in Palace ) Who is that knocking ? Who disturbs me in my sleep ? JUPITER ( Standing beneath Palace , hiding his face with shield ) A general ! ALKMENA ( Off stage ; in Palace ) A general ? And what is a general doing wandering about at this time of night ? Is he a deserter ? Or is he defeated ? JUPITER Defeated  --  by love ! ALKMENA I know only one general and he would n't admit such a defeat . JUPITER That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 ALKMENA If I do n't know him , how can I admit him ? JUPITER Because he comes for once as your lover . Let him in ! ALKMENA ( Comes out on balcony ) It is to Alkmena you speak . I have no lover . ( JUPITER laughs derisively ) Why do you laugh ? JUPITER Did you not only a moment ago open the window of your room and look out , anguished , into the night ? ALKMENA Yes , I did . But I was looking at the night and that 's all I was looking at . JUPITER But did you not feel your heart contract and your body expand at the thought of a man , who is , I confess it , extremely ugly and generally rather limited ? ALKMENA Do you confess it , perhaps , because you wish to be contradicted ? JUPITER No , not necessarily . And as you gazed up at a falling star , did you not wish aloud : " Oh , if only while he were at the war , I might forego all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he loves his horses and his battles better than he loves me . And what does that prove ? JUPITER That you have a lover , and that he is here . p. 34 ALKMENA I have a husband and he is evidently not here . And I receive no one in my bedroom who is not my husband . And not even him will I admit if he does not acknowledge his name . You 're not very good at passionate disguises  --  it 's not your metier . JUPITER Oh , at this hour , when everything between here and heaven is in disguise , may not your husband also disguise himself as a lover ? ALKMENA Your insight , my friend , is not very keen if you think the night is only the day-time masked , the moon no more than a sun disguised , and that the love of a wife for her husband can be confused with an amour . JUPITER Wifely love is a duty . Duty is compulsion . And compulsion kills desire . ALKMENA Desire ! Desire is a half-god . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lesser gods we leave to adolescent girls , to the casually married , to the fugitive romantics , the half-wives . JUPITER It is blasphemy to speak so even of a lesser god ! ALKMENA In my secret heart I am more blasphemous even than that for I worship a god that does n't exist at all . Shall I tell you who it is ? It 's the god of conjugal love , one that it never occurred to the gods to invent  --  they are so casual . If you come in behalf of Desire you ask me to betray a greater god for a lesser . If then you are a lover I am sorry but I must ask you to go on . You are handsome and you have a good figure . Your voice is winning . Did it sound in behalf of Fidelity I might love this voice . I might wish to be enclosed in those arms . Your mouth , too , I should say , is dewy and ardent . But I sha n't allow it to persuade me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? p. 35 JUPITER Why ca n't your husband be your lover ? ALKMENA Because a lover is closer always to love than he is to the object of his love . Because it is ill-bred to deceive your husband  --  even with himself . Because I like my windows open and my linen fresh . ( She goes back inside . MERCURY enters . ) JUPITER She 's impossible . MERCURY She 's set in her ways . JUPITER You ca n't talk to her . MERCURY Not in your language . JUPITER You ca n't appeal to her ! MERCURY She is unfortunately a good woman . JUPITER Mercury , she 's not a woman , she 's a fortress ! MERCURY A fortress that may be taken only by her husband . Do as I advised you in the first place  --  be her husband ! JUPITER Very well  --  I 'll humble myself . ( Give shield and spear to MERCURY . ) MERCURY That 's better . JUPITER But once I am admitted as her husband  --  then I 'll make her yearn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your own resources , Jupiter . Meantime  --  JUPITER Meantime  --  ( Waves MERCURY off . MERCURY exits as JUPITER knocks again . ) ALKMENA Who is it now ? I seem to have a perfect stream of visitors tonight . Now who are you ? JUPITER I am Amphitryon , your husband ! ALKMENA ( Comes in at last ) Amphitryon ! Why did n't you say so in the first place ? JUPITER Let me in ! ALKMENA Are you he by whose side I wake every morning and for whom I cut from the margin of my own day an extra ten minutes of sleep ? JUPITER I am he . ALKMENA Are you the one whose least footfall is so familiar to me that I can tell whether he is shaving or dressing ? JUPITER I am the one . ALKMENA Are you the being with whom I dine and breakfast and sup ? And whom I allow to go to sleep ten minutes every night before I do ? JUPITER I am that being . ALKMENA Then swear in the presence of the night those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of the day . p. 37 JUPITER A wedding ceremony , in the void of the night , with neither priest nor altar ? What for ? ALKMENA That the invisible beings which surround us may not be deceived seeing Alkmena receive you like this  --  like a lover . That the clear light in which we live by day may transfigure even the night . Oh , Amphitryon , I have often dreamed of an occasion like this ! Why should the night be the hand-maiden for the clandestine  --  the furtive  --  the illicit ? Let her for once be bridesmaid to married love . Do you think I wish this lovely night  --  this constellation of stars and little winds  --  this company of night moths and shadows  --  to imagine that I , Alkmena , am receiving a lover ? No ! At this hour , when there are consummated so many false marriages , let us seal our nocturnal , true one ! Shall we begin ? JUPITER If you only knew , Alkmena , how pitiful to the gods human beings seem , prating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand and crook your index finger ! ( Raises her hand and crooks her index finger . ) JUPITER No ! Not the index finger . ALKMENA Why not ? JUPITER That is the most formidable oath of all . The one used by Jupiter to fester the Earth with plagues . p. 38 ALKMENA The index finger or nothing . If not the index finger , you must go away ! JUPITER ( Beaten ; raises his right arm and crooks index finger at the at the same time , covering right side of his face with mantle ) Celestial calamities  --  restrain yourselves ! Earthquakes and floods , fevers and locusts  --  hold off ! ALKMENA Amphitryon , those are not the words ! JUPITER I was just practising . ( Lets down mantle and proceeds in earnest ) I , Amphitryon , son and grandson of former generals , father and grandfather of future generals indispensable clasp in the twin girdle of war and glory  --  ALKMENA ( With her right arm also raised and index finger crooked ) I , Alkmena , whose parents are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link in the chain of humanity  --  JUPITER I swear so to contrive it that the fragrance of the name of Alkmena shall survive so long as the hurly-burly of my own . ALKMENA And I swear to be faithful to Amphitryon , my husband , or to die ! JUPITER ( Alarmed ) To what ? p. 39 ALKMENA To die ! JUPITER Do n't say that , Alkmena . ALKMENA Why not ? I mean it . And now , dear husband , the ceremony is over and I authorize you to come in . You know you 've really been very simple . The gate was open all the time  --  you had only to push it  --  ever so little . ( JUPITER opens gate , goes up three steps and then stands there as if rooted to the spot ) Why do you hesitate ? JUPITER You really mean it ? You really want me to come in ? ALKMENA My dearest love I command it ! ( JUPITER mounts the steps quickly , tears the sashes off her , and enfolds her in his mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALKMENA 'S bedroom in AMPHITRYON 'S Palace . TIME : The next morning . The darkness is complete save for the glow of light which emanates from the body of MERCURY lying semi-recumbent at the front of the stage . MERCURY Posted here in front of Alkmena 's bedroom , I have been soaking in the sweet silence , the gentle resistance , the easy struggle from indoors ; already Alkmena bears within herself the young half-god , but never with any other mistress has Jupiter tarried this long  --  whether this abnormal darkness is beginning to bore you I can not say , but this job that Jupiter has wished on me of prolonging the night till he gets ready to get up is beginning to weigh on me a bit . Especially when I think that everywhere else the whole world is suffused in broad daylight . After all it 's midsummer and early in the morning . The great inundation of day canopies out over all the world , thousands and thousands of leagues to the very margin of the sea . Solitary , amid the rose-drenched cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really ought to wake my master ; he loathes a hurried exit and he will surely wish by way of dressing-gown chatter to reveal to Alkmena that he is Jupiter . He will not willingly forego this sop to his vanity . He will love to enjoy her astonishment and to savor in her pride . Besides , I 've suggested to Amphitryon that he come to surprise his wife at break of dawn . This is a courtesy we owe him and it will relieve the situation of any ambiguity . Already , Amphitryon has taken secretly to the road , he is galloping furiously and within the hour he will arrive here at this palace . Therefore , Sun , display your rays to me , that I may choose the one best fitted to kindle these shadows . ( The Sun obliges with a green ray which picks out MERCURY 'S winged boot ) No , no . There 's nothing more sinister than green rays for lovers to wake up on . Each one thinks the other has been drowned in the night . ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor that one . Purple and violet are colors that inflame the senses . We 'll save them for tonight . ( The Sun obliges with an amber ray ) Ah , that 's it , saffron ! Nothing so well as saffron to bring out the insipid quality of the human skin . Get on with it , Sun ! ( MERCURY rises and runs off in the darkness . The stage is flooded in full sunlight. ) p. 41 p. 42 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWOSCENE II SCENE : A room in the Palace . There is a couch in the center . Two small tabourets one on each side of couch . There is an urn on each tabouret . Also a small handle-bell . ALKMENA enters , puts down her cloak and hat on couch . ALKMENA Get up , Amphitryon , the sun has risen . JUPITER ( Off stage ) Where am I ? ALKMENA In the last place where husbands think they are when they wake up ; simply in your own home in your own bed , and with your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off stage ) And what is the name of this wife ? ALKMENA Her name is the same by day as it is by night  --  it is still Alkmena . JUPITER Is it that marvellously dark Alkmena  --  who never says a word while love-making ? ALKMENA Yes , and who prattles of dawn , and who is now about to put you out of here , husband or no husband . Come along , Amphitryon , you 'll be late for your war ! Are you getting dressed ? JUPITER ( Still off stage ) Yes . Oh , come back to my arms ! p. 43 ALKMENA Do n't count on that ! Dark women have this in common with dreams  --  you may embrace them only at night . JUPITER Well , come back and close your eyes then and let us make the best of an improvised darkness . ALKMENA No , no , the early morning is no time for improvisation . Get up , Amphitryon . Please . ( Sits on couch , her feet stretched out ) Come along , darling , breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come in with breakfast trays . NENETZA serves ALKMENA , KLEANTHA stands holding her tray . JUPITER enters and as he passes ALKMENA , she fondly slaps his behind and he stops a moment and smiles with satisfaction . Sits at end of couch , his feet outstretched . KLEANTHA puts tray on his lap and then both maids exit . ) JUPITER What a divine night ! ALKMENA Your adjectives this morning , darling , are somewhat feeble . JUPITER I said divine ! ALKMENA You could say a cut of beef was divine or a meal was divine , but for last night you might have found something better . JUPITER What could there possibly be better ? p. 44 ALKMENA Almost any adjective except divine . It 's such a worn-out word . Perfect ! You could have said it was a perfect night . Charming ! Best of all , you might have said it was a pleasant night ! Now , that conveys so many agreeable sensations : " What a pleasant night ! " JUPITER But do n't you think that this night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ? ALKMENA ( Drinking ) Well , that depends . JUPITER On what does it depend ? ALKMENA Have you forgotten , my own husband , the night we were married ? The miraculous discovery our two hearts made of each other , in the midst of those shadows which for the first time held us in their embrace ? That was our most beautiful night ! JUPITER Our most beautiful , yes . But the pleasantest was this one . ALKMENA ( Nonchalantly ) Do you think so ? JUPITER Yes , I do . ALKMENA I do n't . What about the night the great fire broke out in Thebes  --  and you came back to me at sunrise all gilt from the fire and warm as new-baked bread ? That was our pleasantest night and you 'll never persuade me differently . ( Eats fruit. ) p. 45 JUPITER Well , if nothing else , then , you must admit this was the most astonishing . ALKMENA Was it ? Why ? Now , the night before last , for instance , when you rescued that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kept flinging your arms around me to rescue me from imaginary drowning  --  yes , that was rather astonishing , if you like . No , my dear , if you wish to sum up this night in an appropriate adjective , I should say that this night , of all our nights , was the most  --  connubial . That 's it , my sweet  --  connubial ! There was a sense of security about it which gladdened me . Never have I felt so certain of waking up in the morning to find you beside me ; there was mercifully absent that fear which obsesses me constantly  --  of finding you suddenly dead in my arms . ( Eats the fruit . ) JUPITER ( Puts the tray down with sudden distaste ) Connubial  --  ? ( Sits up with feet on floor . ) ALKMENA Connubial ! JUPITER ( Rises ) Lovely room ! ALKMENA It seems especially attractive to you this morning when you have no business to be here . JUPITER How clever of men , to devise this system of colonnades which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 46 ALKMENA Since it was you who devised the system , darling , that 's very modest of you . JUPITER Beautiful landscape ! ALKMENA Ah , that you may admire since you did not create it . JUPITER ( Significantly ) And who did , may I ask ? ALKMENA ( Nonchalantly ) The Master of the Gods JUPITER And may one hear his name ? ALKMENA Jupiter . JUPITER ( Ravished , leans over couch ) How prettily you pronounce the names of the gods ! Who taught you to savor them so on your lips , as if you were enjoying a heavenly diet ? Like a lamb that nibbles at laburnum and lifts his head to nibble more . Say his name again  --  repeat his name ! It is said that the gods , summoned so , respond sometimes with their very presence ! ALKMENA ( Calling ) Neptune ! Apollo ! JUPITER No , no , the first one  --  repeat his name . ALKMENA No , no , no . I like to nibble all over Olympus . Especially I love to pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Venus and Mars ! Jupiter and Juno ! p. 47 JUPITER ( Laughs nervously ) No , no , no . ALKMENA I see them wandering about eternally  --  hand in hand  --  on the crests of the clouds  --  it must be marvelous ! JUPITER Great fun ! You think that Jupiter has done a good job then , with these rocks and cliffs  --  he 's done pretty well on this landscape ? ALKMENA Yes , it 's very nice , but do you think he did it on purpose ? JUPITER ( Shocked ) Alkmena ! ALKMENA Well , everything you do , you do on purpose , whether you are grafting cherry trees on plums or contriving a doubleedged sword . But do you think that Jupiter , on the day that he created all this , knew what he was doing ? JUPITER ( Hurt ) It is generally assumed that he did ! ALKMENA We know he created the Earth . But the beauty of the Earth re-creates itself momentarily . Jupiter seems too settled to have dallied so with the ephemeral ! JUPITER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the purpose of creation . ALKMENA No , I suppose I have n't . How does it all seem to you , darling ? Does n't it seem cloudy ? p. 48 JUPITER No , no ! I see everything perfectly clearly . ( Sits beside her again ) In the beginning everything was Chaos . It was then Jupiter 's felicitous idea to separate everything into four elements . ALKMENA We have only four elements ? JUPITER Four . And the first is water , and water , I may tell you , was not so easy to create . Superficially , water looks like quite ordinary stuff . But imagine , if you had never seen water  --  if there were no water in existence , what it would mean to create it  --  even to get the idea of creating it . ALKMENA What did the goddesses cry  --  in the pre-water era ? Bronze tears ? That stumps you ! JUPITER Do n't interrupt me , Alkmena , I 'm trying to give you some idea of what Jupiter must be  --  I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialize before you at any moment , you know , without warning . Would n't you like to have him explain everything to you personally in all his magnificence ? ( He gets up . ) ALKMENA No , darling , I 'd rather have you explain it to me . JUPITER ( Nonplussed , sits again ) Where was I ? p. 49 ALKMENA We 've just disposed of original Chaos . JUPITER Oh , yes . Once water was in existence it occurred to him to bank it in with broken coasts , in order to stop the impact of the storms , and to strew the surface of the waters with Continents , in order to spare the eyes of the gods the perpetual irritation of a glittering horizon  --  And so came the Earth and all its marvels ! ALKMENA Oh , you mean the pine trees ? JUPITER Pine trees ? ALKMENA And the echo ? JUPITER The echo ? ALKMENA You sound like one yourself . Now color  --  did Jupiter create color ? JUPITER ( Proudly ) Yes . The seven colors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Mean my favorite colors : bronze and dark red and lizard green  --  what of them ? JUPITER No , he left those to the cleaning and dyeing establishments  --  ALKMENA ( Notices a hole in his sock ) Amphitryon ! You have a hole in your stocking  --  did Jupiter create that ? p. 50 JUPITER ( Pleased at his own verisimilitude ) Yes  --  ! ALKMENA Oh , he did , did he ? ( Calling ) Nenetza ! Yarn , yarn JUPITER Shall we go back to the assorted vibrations in the ether , of which I was speaking  --  ( NENETZA entes with yarn and sewing stand and places it near couch . ALKMENA picks a needle and proceeds to mend the sock . NENETZA takes both breakfast trays and goes out . ) ALKMENA Yes , yes  --  You ca n't go to war with a hole in your stocking . What will your enemy think of your wife ? Give it to me . ( Takes the sock off his foot . ) JUPITER But to go back again to the assorted vibrations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived it , that by a system of molecular collision  --  infinite impacts and double impacts within the molecules  --  as well as counter-refraction of the original light refractions he was able to criss-cross the Universe with a network of a thousand different systems of color and sound , at once perceptible or not to human sense organs  --  ALKMENA That 's exactly what I was saying . p. 51 JUPITER What you were saying ? ALKMENA Yes . He did n't do a thing ! He did n't do a thing except plunge us into an awful conglomeration of illusions and stupors from which we have to extricate ourselves  --  I and my dear husband . ( She pinches the big toe of his bare foot . ) JUPITER Alkmena , are you aware that the gods may be eavesdropping ? ALKMENA Oh , they know my heart is straightforward and honest . Besides , what does Jupiter expect of me ? That I should expire with gratitude to him for having invented four elements when we could very well use twenty ? I do n't think four elements is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for all eternity . I am far more grateful to you , my dear husband , and my heart bursts with gratitude to you for having invented a system of window-pulleys which has lightened my life and for all those wonderful , new graftings you did for the orchard . ( She puts the mended sock on his foot ) You , Amphitryon , have changed for me the taste of a cherry  --  ( Puts his sandal on ) and you have done more than that  --  you have enlarged the capacity of my pantry shelves ! Now , for me , it is you who are the creator  --  ( JUPITER is staring at her with divine admiration ) Why do you look at me like that ? Compliments embarrass you , is that it ? I suppose you find me too earthbound ? p. 52 JUPITER ( Bends down and kisses her feet ) Would n't you like to be less so ? ALKMENA Less so ? JUPITER You never aspired to be a goddess ? ALKMENA A goddess ? What on earth for ? JUPITER To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JUPITER To be able to walk on water and on the air  --  ALKMENA No , darling , no . JUPITER To understand the meaning of things and other worlds ? ALKMENA No . I 've never taken an undue interest in my neighbors . JUPITER Why  --  then  --  to be immortal ! ALKMENA To be immortal ? What for ? What good would that do me ? JUPITER Not to die ! ALKMENA Not to die ! What would I do if I did n't die ? JUPITER Dearest Alkmena ! You would be changed into a star . You would live forever . You would shine in the night till the end of time . ALKMENA The end of time ? And when will that take place ? p. 53 JUPITER Never ! ALKMENA Oh , dear , what a long evening ! No , darling , no . For that job of night watchwoman the gods had better not count on me . ( Sits up ) Besides , the night air is n't good for my skin . Would n't I get all chapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along couch beside her ) But  --  oh , my darling  --  how cold and empty you 'd be in the trough of death ! ( He buries his head in her bosom . ) ALKMENA Oh , sweet . I 'm not afraid of death . It 's the stake you give for life . I prefer to identify myself with my own companions , who must also die . I feel so storngly that my very fibres will perpetuate themselves in other men  --  and animals  --  plants even  --  that I should feel cheated if I were not allowed to follow this mysterious destiny . Do n't talk to me of not dying , so long as there is a vegetable alive which is n't immortal . For a human being to be immortal  --  is a kind of betrayal of one 's own . Besides , when I think of the wonderful surcease death brings ; to be irritated for sixty years over meals that do n't turn out well  --  holes in stockings  --  aches and pains  --  and then to be offered death  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't deserve ! p. 54 JUPITER But would n't you like to have a son  --  an immortal son ? ALKMENA To want one 's son to be immortal is only human . JUPITER One who would become the greatest of heroes ! One who as a baby would slay serpents come to strangle him in his crib . ALKMENA No , certainly not . He 'll be just a little baby who will coo and be frightened of flies . What are you so upset about ? JUPITER Alkmena , did you really mean it , when you said you 'd rather kill yourself than be unfaithful ? ALKMENA Darling , can you doubt it ? JUPITER But  --  to kill one 's self is so  --  dangerous ! ALKMENA Not for me . If the gods of war should strike you down there would n't be anything in the least tragic about my dying . JUPITER But suppose you drag to death a child conceived the day before and half alive ? ALKMENA For him it would be only a half death . He 'd be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see that you are pious and that you comprehend the mysteries of this world . I must , therefore , speak to you of  --  p. 55 ALKMENA ( Edging away from him as he tries to embrace her ) No . I know what that solemn manner of yours leads to . It 's your way of being tender . Ca n't you for once try being intimate without being  --  pontifical ? JUPITER You must n't joke , Alkmena . The time has come when I must speak to you of the gods . ALKMENA The gods ? JUPITER The moment has arrived when I must clarify for you their relations with men . ALKMENA ( Rises ) Have you lost your senses , Amphitryon ? You choose this moment of all moments to talk theology to me . At this time of day , when everybody  --  drunk with sunlight  --  just ca n't wait to go farming or fishing ! JUPITER Alkmena  --  ALKMENA What 's more , is n't the army waiting for you ? You have only a few minutes left if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that on an empty stomach . No , darling , no . ( Goes upstage and gets scarf ) I have my house to attend to  --  I have my rounds to make  --  I have the gardener to see  --  do you think this house runs itself ? JUPITER ( Rises ) Alkmena ! Dearest Alkmena . Let me apprise you that the gods may appear precisely at the moment when you expect them least ! p. 56 ALKMENA Amphitryon , dear Amphitryon , in a moment I shall deliver you an harangue , not about the gods , but about my servant problems . ( Comes downstage and picks up her hat and sits beside JUPITER ) As a matter of fact , I very much fear that we shall have to dispense with the services of Nenetza . For apart from her special mania for scrubbing only the black tiles in the mosaics , she has yielded , as you might say , to the gods  --  and is just a little  --  pregnant ! ( Rises , jauntily puts on her hat ) Till tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alkmena  --  ( MERCURY enters . ) MERCURY Jupiter , what 's the matter ? What 's happened ? I 've been waiting to see you emerge from this room in all your glory as you 've done from so many others . Instead , it 's Alkmena who makes her departure  --  not the least bit ruffled JUPITER She is n't ruffled . You ca n't ruffle her . MERCURY This is n't turn to form , Jupiter . And what 's that vertical crease doing between your eyes ? Has somebody upset you ? Are you annoyed ? Is there going to be thunder ? JUPITER No . This crease , my dear Mercury , is a wrinkle. p. 57 MERCURY But Jupiter ca n't have wrinkles . That belongs to Amphitryon . JUPITER No  --  no . This wrinkle belongs to me , it 's my wrinkle . ( Looks off after ALKMENA ) And now I know how men come by them . MERCURY I 've never seen you like this , you 're actually stooping with fatigue . JUPITER It 's no light weight to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced the emotion of human love so thoroughly that it 's exhausted you . JUPITER I believe that it is love itself I am experiencing . MERCURY Jupiter , you have the navet of the superman . Do n't be juvenile , this is hardly your first affair . JUPITER But for the first time I held in my arms a woman whom I could not see , whom I could not hear  --  and yet I understood her . MERCURY What went on in your mind ? JUPITER Only that I was her husband . I had limited the compass of my mind to his . MERCURY She never suspected then ? JUPITER Never ! And moreover , and this is strange , I could n't have endured it if she did . From the moment we went to bed to the moment we got up it was impossible for me to be anything but her husband . It was Alkmena who was completely victorious over me . Do you know , that a few moments ago I had occasion to explain Creation to her and I found myself talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am master when I talk to you just  --  just  --  dried up  --  ( Buries his head in his hand in despair ) Mercury , may I expound Creation for you  --  just to keep my hand in ? p. 58 MERCURY If it 's absolutely necessary  --  but just Creation  --  that 's as far as I 'll go . JUPITER Mercury  --  I have also made a discovery  --  MERCURY Let me remind you , as you 're omniscient , discovery for you is impossible . JUPITER Nevertheless , I have discovered that beings are not what the gods think them . Alkmena , the gentle  --  the tender Alkmena has the character of a rock . She is the true Prometheus ! MERCURY It is n't that she has character , she lacks imagination . JUPITER Yes , she lacks imagination and it 's even possible that she is n't very intelligent . She is ambitious neither to shock nor to dazzle . But it 's exactly this single-minded quality in her , this quality of constancy and devotion , against which our power is futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gods talking ? JUPITER She is the only woman I have ever met who is as adorable dressed as unveiled , who when she is absent , makes herself felt as if she were present , whose homespun occupations seem to me as alluring as pleasure itself . To dine with her  --  even to breakfast with her  --  to touch her hand accidentally with a plate or a spoon  --  And then suddenly she will use little expressions  --  and that widens the abyss between us  --  p. 59 MERCURY What expressions ? JUPITER She will say  --  " Wheen I was a child "  --  or " When I 'm old "  --  or  --  " Never in all my life "  --  This stabs me , Mercury . MERCURY I do n't see why . JUPITER We ca n't use these expressions  --  MERCURY We can say anything we like . JUPITER No , we ca n't  --  because we are not born and we do not die . It is between these margins that mortals live as they do between the lovely hedges on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you exchange a cul-de-sac for a panorama ? JUPITER With her , Mercury  --  yes . MERCURY To have what every living thing has  --  it 's a commonplace desire , Jupiter . JUPITER But we miss something , Mercury  --  undoubtedly we miss something  --  the poignance of the transient  --  the intimation of mortality  --  that sweet sadness of grasping at something you can not hold  --  MERCURY It 's very simple  --  make Alkmena immortal ! JUPITER And deprive her of her death ? She 'd never forgive me , she 'd never forgive me for betraying her to the vegetables . The vegetables would never forgive her . No , I 'm too fond of her  --  and I may tell you now that her son , of all my sons , will be my most favorite . p. 60 MERCURY That the Universe knows already ! JUPITER The Universe ? No one knows anything about this affair . MERCURY Oh , yes , they do . I announced everything this morning ! ( JUPITER rises angrily , raises his right arm and his index finger crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops to one knee in terror ) I only did what I 've always done in all your affairs . Why should we suddenly conceal from the world how generous you are ? JUPITER Did you announce that I had visited Alkmena disguised as Amphitryon ? MERCURY Certainly not ! There 's something undignified about that trick . I was afraid it might make a bad impression and since your desire to spend another evening with Alkmena was so obvious that I could sense it through the very walls , I made the formal announcement that Alkmena would receive a visit from Jupiter tonight ! JUPITER To whom did you announce this ? MERCURY In the order prescribed by destiny ! ( A cosmic music is heard ) First to the winds , then to the waters : listen , the undulations of the Universe , both wet and dry , are gossiping in their special language of nothing else . p. 61 JUPITER We 're lost ! Poor Alkmena , we 're lost ! ( MERCURY rises ) She would never allow it . ( Sits on couch again ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would die also . And I would be forced , as I was when I had you , to open my thigh or the fatty part of my calf to shelter a foetus for several months . ( Gong is heard ) No , thank you very much . What 's that ? MERCURY ( Goes up to Arch and looks off ) It 's the whole of Thebes preparing to celebrate your union with Alkmena . They 're organizing a procession . JUPITER Turn it back ! Let the sea engulf it ! MERCURY Jupiter , that 's impossible , these are your own priests JUPITER They have insufficient reasons for their faith in me . ( Gong stops ) For the first time , Mercury , I have a suspicion that a thoroughly first-rate god might make a thoroughly second-rate man . ( Music again ) What 's that ? MERCURY It 's the Virgins coming to congratulate Alkmena  --  in their theoretical way . JUPITER Do n't you think it would be a good idea to drown the Virgins and strike down the priests ? p. 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want ? JUPITER What do I want ? What every man wants ! A thousand contradictory desires ! That Alkmena should remain faithful to her husband and also give herself to me . That she should remain chaste under my caresses and yet that desire should flame up in her under my very sight . That she should know nothing of this intrigue and yet that she should connive at it with all her might ! MERCURY I 've done my stint . The Universe is informed according to prescription that tonight Alkmena will receive a visit from Jupiter . Is there anything else that I can do for you ? ( Drops to one knee before JUPITER . ) JUPITER Yes ! See that she does it  --  and willingly . It is no longer a question of my son , that matter is fortunately disposed of . It is now a question of ME ! Of I , myself ! I 'm degraded by this mortal livery . I shall come to her as a god ! ( Rises majestically . Music ) You must see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love for her . I permit you to approach her , to touch her , agitate her blood , her nerves , appeal to her pride . MERCURY ( Rises ) That 's the spirit , Jupiter . Now that you are willing to forego your incognito I may tell you I 'll persuade her in an instant . She 'll be waiting for you , I promise you . p. 63 ALKMENA ( Calling off stage ) Darling ! ECHO ( Calling off stage ) Darling ! JUPITER Whom is she talking to ? MERCURY She 's flirting with Amphitryon through her echo  --  and you say she is n't a coquette ! Even for her voice she has a mirror ! ALKMENA ( Calling off stage ) Darling ! ECHO ( Calling off stage ) Darling ! ( Music . ) JUPITER " Nymph , in thy orisons , be all thy sins remembered . " What are you smiling at ? MERCURY Have you heard that expression somewhere before ? JUPITER No , somewhere not yet . It is whispered to me in the future , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not leave this city until she has capitulated in my honor of her own free will ! ( Music . ) ALKMENA ( Calling off stage ) Darling ! ECHO ( Calling off stage ) Darling ! ( JUPITER exits . MERCURY conceals himself . ALKMENA enters , followed by KLEANTHA , bearing a garden basket full of vegetables and ALKMENA 'S hat. ) p. 64 ALKMENA Kleantha , will you look at those turnips ! Your master does n't like turnips , but when they 're cooked , he thinks they 're something else . And tell cook to fan those melons until they 're cool , if she has to fan all day . KLEANTHA Yes , mistress . ( Exits with sewing stand , basket and hat . MERCURY comes down from his hiding place . ) MERCURY Salutations , Princess ! ALKMENA ( Amazed , stops at arch ) You 're a god ! MERCURY Not of the first rank  --  but a god . ALKMENA You 're Mercury . I know your face . MERCURY Thank you , Princess . Most people recognize me by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you care to touch me , I 'm in a position to authorize it . ( She curtsies to him ) I see the gods interest you . ALKMENA Oh , I love the gods . MERCURY All of them ? Am I included in this affection ? ALKMENA You 're one of my favorites . MERCURY Why ? ALKMENA Your name  --  Mercury  --  is so beautiful . Then  --  of course , you are the god of eloquence . I knew that the moment I saw you . p. 65 MERCURY Your face , too , Princess , is a kind of exquisite speech . ( MERCURY graciously indicates that she may sit . She does so ) But tell me  --  have you no preference among the gods ? ALKMENA Of course I have a preference  --  Jupiter ! MERCURY Jupiter ? You astonish me rather . He has no specialty . ALKMENA Is n't divinity a kind of specialty ? MERCURY Yes , but he is n't gifted . Are you so influenced by his position as Master of the Gods ? It 's a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALKMENA He 's very beautiful . MERCURY He has no knowledge of rhetoric . ALKMENA No ? MERCURY And no connoisseurship in the fine arts . ALKMENA But he 's so dignified ! MERCURY Musically he 's tone deaf . He ca n't distinguish between celestial and chamber music . We must face it , Alkmena , Jupiter is not talented . ALKMENA If you 'll forgive my saying so , Mercury , I think you 're being a little disloyal to your master ? Why , only a few moments ago , my husband and I were saying how wonderful he is with molecules . p. 66 MERCURY Yes , but he 's mad about women . ALKMENA I understand these passionate impulses of his which cause him to hurl himself into the arms of mortal women . You see , I 've learned from my husband all about grafting  --  he 's done wonderful things with cherries , you know . You must have heard of him up there . MERCURY Oh , of course . ALKMENA Yes , of course . Then , at school , we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even with purity that got the most wonderful results when performed with women especially honored for this high mission  --  Does this bore you ? MERCURY No , on the contrary , you fill me with delight . The fate , then , of all the women whom Jupiter 's loved or ever will love seems to you a happy fate ? ALKMENA Infinitely happy . MERCURY Enviable ? ALKMENA Highly enviable . MERCURY In short  --  you envy them ? ALKMENA I envy them . Why do you ask me that ? MERCURY Do n't you guess why ? Do n't you know why I 've come here and what announcement I have to make to you as a special messenger from my master ? p. 67 ALKMENA No . Tell me . MERCURY It 's that he loves you . Jupiter loves you . ALKMENA Jupiter  --  loves me ? Oh  --  ( Laughs at the preposterousness of the idea ) I am the most fortunate of women . MERCURY He 's had his eye on you for a number of days now . Not one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced in his radiant vision . ALKMENA For a number of days ? MERCURY And a number of nights . ( Notices her shocked expression ) You grow pale  --  ALKMENA I know I should blush but it kills me to think that Jupiter 's been looking at me all this time and I probably was n't at my best . Why did n't you warn me ? MERCURY And what answer shall I give him now ? ALKMENA ( Rises , as does MERCURY ) Tell him  --  of course  --  that I shall do my best to earn his gracious favor . I already have a silver altar to him in the Palace . When Amphitryon returns , we 'll build a gold one . MERCURY It is n't an altar he 's interested in. p. 68 ALKMENA Everything here belongs to him . Even my most precious possessions . He has only to choose . MERCURY He 's already chosen it and tonight he 's coming to claim it . ALKMENA What is it ? MERCURY Your bed . I have just given my orders to the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get together the brilliant effects and the appropriate sounds for a celestial wedding . It will be less a night than a sample of your immortal future . It gives me pleasure to season your more perishable moments with these pinches of immortality  --  my engagement present ! ( ALKMENA smiles ) Why do you smile ? ALKMENA I 've smiled at less . MERCURY But why ? ALKMENA Quite simply because this is obviously a case of mistaken identity . I am Alkmena , and Amphitryon is my husband . MERCURY But the cosmic forces do not consider husbands . ALKMENA But think , Mercury , of all women in Thebes , to have chosen me ? I 'm a very commonplace woman . I was n't very good at school and what I did learn I 've forgotten . I am not , in fact , considered over bright . MERCURY That opinion I do not share . p. 69 ALKMENA At the moment it 's not you I 'm thinking of , but Jupiter . When it comes to a momentous matter  --  like receiving Jupiter  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen you from on high and your body lights up the night of Greece . ALKMENA Yes , I have my devices for artificial lighting  --  I have my powders and lotions  --  I manage with tweezers and files to put up some kind of an appearance , but I can not write and I can not even think . MERCURY But you talk very well . Even if you did n't , it would n't matter because tonight all the poets of posterity will be carrying on the conversation for you . ALKMENA I wish they 'd carry the rest as well . MERCURY This flippancy does n't become you , Alkmena . Do you think you can escape the gods by underestimating your surpassing qualities of nobility and beauty ? Besides you seem to be unaware of the magnificence of this  --  opportunity . ALKMENA But that 's exactly what I 'm trying to convey to you , Mercury  --  how little I am suited for this opportunity . I live in the earthiest of atmospheres . It is so thick that no god could stand it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is n't a liaison . It 's a matter of a few hours . p. 70 ALKMENA How do you know ? Jupiter may turn out to be constant . That he should be interested at all is what I ca n't get over . MERCURY I do n't see why . You will admit your figure is superlative . ALKMENA My figure is all right , but does Jupiter know that I tan the most dreadful color in summer ? MERCURY Your hands embellish the flowers as you pick them in your garden . ALKMENA My hands are all right but one has only two hands , and I 'll tell you something , Mercury , that is n't generally known  --  I have one tooth too many . MERCURY Your walk , though , overflows with promise . ALKMENA That 's a false lead , believe me . When it comes to love-making , I 'm not very mature . MERCURY It 's no use . Jupiter has observed you in that capacity also . ALKMENA ( Starts to cry ) Sometimes one pretends . MERCURY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Music ) At this moment you weep ; at this moment when a flood of joy is about to inundate humanity in your honor ? Tonight a year of joy begins for Thebes . No more epidemics . No more pestilence . No more war . No more famines . p. 71 ALKMENA It 's not fair ! MERCURY In your city are eight little children who , this very week , were destined to die . Four little boys and four little girls  --  among the latter your favorite Charissa . You can save them ! ALKMENA Charissa ! If anyone else did this it would be called blackmail ! MERCURY Health and happiness are the exclusive blackmail of the gods . Do you hear , Alkmena ? The poor and the sick are beside themselves with joy for they will owe to you their happiness and their life . Now , Alkmena , you are apprised of what is to be . Farewell ! ALKMENA You are going ? MERCURY I must . I have to tell Jupiter you are expecting him . ALKMENA You would be telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MERCURY What ? ALKMENA I am not expecting him . MERCURY Why not ? ALKMENA I am tired . I am ill . MERCURY It 's not true . Do n't try to put off the gods with lies which are effective with men . ALKMENA But it is a man I love . p. 72 MERCURY What man ? ALKMENA My husband . MERCURY Yes , you love your husband . ALKMENA I love him . MERCURY But that 's what we 're counting on ! Jupiter does n't choose his mistresses among unfaithful wives . ALKMENA If I am taken by surprise , Mercury , I warn you I shall defend myself if I have only my naked body and my naked legs . MERCURY Do n't force me to speak bluntly to you , Alkmena , and to reveal to you the hidden depths of what you are pleased to think of as your purity . Conversationally , I find you cynical enough . ALKMENA I adapt my speech to yours . You leave me no choice . MERCURY Very well , we 'll come straight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight 's encounter , a child is to be born . ALKMENA The child is already named , I suppose ? MERCURY Yes . It has a name . ALKMENA Poor little girl . She 'll never be born . MERCURY It 's a boy and he will be born ! p. 73 ALKMENA What will happen when I refuse ? MERCURY The child must be born . ALKMENA When I kill myself ? MERCURY Jupiter will reincarnate you for this son must be born . ALKMENA A child born of adultery , never ! Divine son though he be  --  he shall die ! MERCURY Alkmena , the patience of the gods has its limits . You abuse their courtesy . After all , we do n't need your consent . SOSIE ( Off stage ) Mistress ALKMENA What is it , Sosie ? SOSIE Queen Leda has just arrived at the Palace . ALKMENA Queen Leda ? MERCURY Leda , the Queen of Sparts , whom Jupiter loved in the guise of a swan , your predecessor . See her , Alkmena ; draw her out . She may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MERCURY I 'm going  --  I must report our conversation to Jupiter . ALKMENA Shall you give him my answer ? MERCURY I ca n't believe , Alkmena , that you really want to see your city infected by pestilence , razed to the ground by fire . Do you want to see your husband defeated ? I shall tell Jupiter that you 're expecting him . p. 74 ALKMENA You 'll be telling him a lie ! MERCURY With women I find the morning lie becomes the evening truth ! Till tonight , Alkmena . ( MERCURY exits . ) ALKMENA ( Calls ) Sosie  --  ( SOSIE enters ) Tell me  --  Queen Leda  --  how does she seem ? SOSIE She 's wearing silver piped in swansdown but very good taste . ALKMENA No  --  her face I mean  --  Haughty ? Hard ? SOSIE No , serene and noble . ALKMENA Good ! Tell her to come in ! ( SOSIE exits ) I have an idea , a wonderful idea . ( QUEEN LEDA comes in . She goes at once to ALKMENA and offers her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses her hand . ) LEDA Alkmena , I hope you do not find my visit too indiscreet ? ALKMENA No , no , Leda  --  LEDA I was passing through Thebes and heard the news and I wanted to see you . ALKMENA I 'm enchanted . LEDA ( Pointing toward the bedroom and gushing rather ) Is that the historic bedroom to be ? p. 75 ALKMENA It 's my bedroom . LEDA And is it for tonight ? ALKMENA I hear it 's for tonight . LEDA You 've done very well , very well indeed . How did you manage it ? ( Both sit on couch ) Did you offer endless prayers ? Did you cry aloud your misery , your nostalgia for a god ? ALKMENA No , I expressed my happiness and my contentment . LEDA I see  --  well , perhaps that 's an even better way of calling for help . Have you seen him ? ALKMENA No . Is it he who sends you here ? LEDA No  --  ALKMENA It 's not that you 'd like to catch another glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never had one . I 've never seen him . ALKMENA Never ? LEDA Never ! ALKMENA I thought you had at least a nodding acquaintance with him . LEDA You do n't seem to know the details of our little adventure . ALKMENA Not intimately  --  p. 76 LEDA Oh , well  --  it was summer . ( Music ) Great schools of swan had been coursing high up among the stars . They were so beautiful I could n't take my eyes off them . My husband even noticed it and made jokes about it  --  your swan-song will be with a swan , he said . ALKMENA Your husband made jokes about it ? LEDA My husband 's an atheist . Not believing in the gods , he sees nothing in this but a vehicle for puns . Of course there is an advantage in that ! ALKMENA Then it 's true what legend tells us , that Jupiter came to you in the guise of a swan ? LEDA Well  --  up to a certain point he was , a sort of cloudburst  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly . I touched the wingroots with my fingers  --  a harp of feathers . Alkmena , to be perfectly frank  --  I would rather , if you do n't mind , that with you he would n't be a swan again . I 'm not of a jealous disposition at all , but if you could leave me this little distinction , it would be so nice of you . After all , there are so many other birds , much rarer ones , even . ALKMENA Yes , but few are as noble and I do n't think they 're a bit more stupid than geese or eagles , and they sing too , after a fashion , do n't they ? p. 77 LEDA Oh , indeed they do ! ALKMENA Nobody listens to them , but they sing . Did he sing ? LEDA Well  --  he did n't exactly sing  --  it was a beautifully enunciated chirp , a chirp of which the sense escaped me but of which the syntax was so pure , the diction so exquisite , that you could just feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he overwhelm you  --  I mean were you taken by surprise ? LEDA Warned and surprised . Assaulted , gently assaulted . Swathed in a movement which was not earthly but astral , cradled in an eternal cosmic rolling . ALKMENA And how did he leave you ? Tell me that . LEDA He rose straight to my zenith . He was gracious enough to endow me for several seconds with his sight . This enabled me to follow him from my zenith to his , from zenith to zenith  --  and there I lost him . ALKMENA Oh , is that all ? LEDA Well , for the Master of the Gods I think it 's a good deal ! ALKMENA Yes , but after a little while  --  the next day perhaps  --  no trifling gift ? LEDA No. p. 78 ALKMENA No flowers ? LEDA No . ALKMENA Not even a little colored egg ? LEDA In a way I get little communications from him . The branches of a pear tree , for example , bow down to me in homage as I pass . ALKMENA Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LEDA As a matter of fact , I would n't have cared for a prolonged liaison even with a god . ALKMENA A prolonged liaison , no . But I do think he might have paid you a second visit . LEDA ( Crestfallen ) Do you ? ALKMENA Yes . Leda , you 're not happy . I can tell . Jupiter has n't made you happy . LEDA I am more than happy . I am sanctified . ALKMENA You 're too young , no , no , you 're too beautiful to be canonized so early . It was a shabby trick . Jupiter loved you and abandoned you . LEDA Abandoned me ? ALKMENA Yes , he deserted you , did n't he ? He did n't come back , did he ? Trying to make it up to you with genuflections from a pear tree ! If I were you , Leda , I 'd revenge myself . He did n't even make an honest legend of you . p. 79 LEDA How can I revenge myself on a white swan ? ALKMENA I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . LEDA What ? ALKMENA That door leads to my room . You go in there  --  put on my veils , spray my scent about  --  I can make it very dark . Jupiter will be deceived and to his advantage . LEDA But you do n't know , you do n't realize what it means . If you knew him as I do , you would n't be so generous . ALKMENA I thought you said you did n't know him . LEDA I know him as a bird ! Alkmena , in spite of everything I 've said , it was worth it ! You 'll see , you 'll be so relaxed . ALKMENA But I do n't want to be relaxed , I 'm not a bit tense . And besides I 've already made up my mind to refuse him . LEDA That 's astonishing . Why ? ALKMENA I 'm in love with my husband . LEDA Are you really ? Oh , my dear  --  well , you ca n't go on being so exclusive forever so you might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm unworthy of this honor . Now you are not only the most beautiful of reigning queens , you are also the most intelligent . Who but you could possibly work out a whole syntax , construct a grammar from a bird-call . You invented writing , did n't you ? p. 80 LEDA That 's wasted on the gods because they have n't invented reading yet . ALKMENA You know astronomy . You know exactly where your zenith is and where your nadir . I 'm always getting them mixed up . You have a scientific background . No , Leda , you 're far more suitable for Jupiter than I am . LEDA I see  --  I 'm beginning to understand  --  The more I see you , the more I listen to you , the more I begin to be persuaded that celestial contact might be fatal to your special charm . Yes , if you 're still determined  --  I 'll help you . ALKMENA Oh , Leda , Leda  --  LEDA On one condition . ALKMENA Condition ? LEDA You must admit that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repulsive to me . ALKMENA Oh , yes  --  LEDA In what form will Jupiter come ? ALKMENA I do n't know ! LEDA You can know . ALKMENA How ? LEDA He will assume some shape that haunts your desires and your dreams . p. 81 ALKMENA But I 'm not a haunted woman . LEDA Jupiter is so versatile . I hope it is n't a serpent . I have a horror of serpents . You ca n't count on me if it 's a serpent ! ( Rises . ) ALKMENA ( Rising ) Leda , I have one weakness . LEDA What is it ? ALKMENA My husband . LEDA Your husband ? Your husband  --  what does he look like ? ALKMENA My husband ? What 's he like ? I have n't the faintest ideal LEDA Have you his portrait ? ALKMENA Oh , yes  --  here . ( Shows medallion she is wearing on a chain around her neck . ) LEDA Is his hair blond ? ALKMENA No , black like a raven 's wing . LEDA He has those enigmatic eyes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) He 's not a god . He 's my husband , Leda . LEDA Your husband , of course . Why did n't we think of that before ? Your swan will be an Amphitryon . The first time your husband leaves home , Jupiter will enter your bedroom and you 'll never know the difference . p. 82 ALKMENA You terrify me . Amphitryon is away now ! LEDA Away from Thebes ? ALKMENA Yes , he left this morning for the war . LEDA When is he coming back ? ALKMENA ( Looking over back wall ) I have n't the faintest idea . LEDA You ca n't wage a war decently in less than two days ! ALKMENA No , I 'm afraid not . LEDA Before tonight I promise you that Jupiter will enter that door , so like Amphitryon that you will succumb to him . ALKMENA I could n't possibly be deceived  --  I should know him . LEDA For once a human being will be a divine imitation , and you will be misled . ALKMENA Exactly . He 'll be more perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall hate him at first sight . ( Comes down to LEDA . ) LEDA And I tell you that with me he was a simply enormous swan and I could n't distinguish him from the swan I see every day on my own river  --  SOSIE ( Off stage ) News , Mistress , unexpected news ! ( Entering. ) p. 83 ALKMENA Amphiryon is here ! SOSIE How did you know ? I saw him leaping the moats on his galloping steed . ALKMENA No rider ever jumped them before ! SOSIE One leap was enough for him . LEDA Is he alone ? SOSIE Alone , but around him one could feel an invisible squadron . What shall I do ? ALKMENA Go down the hill and meet him . ( Exit SOSIE . ) LEDA Now are you convinced ? It 's Jupiter , Jupiter the sham Amphitryon . ALKMENA Very well then he shall find here the sham Alkmena . Oh , Leda , I feel you are my friend . Do n't friends do things like this for each other ? LEDA Very often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room 's in there ? ( She starts for bedroom . ) ALKMENA ( Following her ) In there , in there . LEDA Are there steps going down ? I have a horror of slipping in the dark . ALKMENA No , a smooth level floor . You must n't weaken at the last moment , Leda. p. 84 LEDA I have promised . I 've never let a friend down yet ! ( As she goes into bedroom ) This way  --  oh , yes , it 's charming . SOSIE ( Off stage ) Your horses , my lord , what shall I do with your horses ? They 're exhausted . AMPHITRYON ( Also off stage ) Do n't bother me about my horses , I shall be leaving again in a minute . ALKMENA ( Listening hard ) He 's lost interest in his horses , it 's certainly not Amphitryon ! AMPHITRYON ( Still off stage ) Darling , it is I. ( He comes in . He goes to couch , throws down his cape and helmet . ) ALKMENA No one else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to kiss me ? ALKMENA ( Scrutinizing him , more and more amazed at the perfection of the imitation ) Yes  --  in a minute . Let me look at you first . You 're not afraid to show your face to your wife , are you ? Your wife who is so familiar with it ! AMPHITRYON Well  --  here it is. p. 85 ALKMENA Yes  --  everything 's there ! Even those criss-crossed wrinkles , clawed by I know not what bird . Jupiter 's eagle , I suppose . AMPHITRYON They 're not eagle 's feet , darling , they 're crow 's feet . ALKMENA Nevertheless , something 's lacking  --  that scratch is lacking which he got yesterday . Strange husband that comes back from the war with one scratch less . AMPHITRYON ( Sits on couch and takes off his greaves ) Nothing like fresh air for cuts . ALKMENA Marvellously healthy , is n't it , that outdoor exercise on a battlefield ? What 's going on behind that forehead  --  that forehead that is so much larger than usual ? AMPHITRYON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what is that face thinking of  --  that face that gets bigger and bigger the more I look at it ? AMPHITRYON ( Rises and goes to her ) Of kissing your lips ! ALKMENA ( Escaping from him ) Why my lips ? AMPHITRYON ( Follows more impetuously ) Of biting the nape of your neck . p. 86 ALKMENA Amphitryon , what 's come over you ? I 've never heard you talk like this before . AMPHITRYON Alkmena , what 's the matter ? ALKMENA Where did you sleep last night ? AMPHITRYON In the brambles  --  with a bundle of vine-shoots for a pillow . Oh , darling , I have to leave within the hour , for we 're giving battle this morning . ( Close to her at last ) What is this sudden reserve between us ? ( He seizes her and kisses her passionately ) You behave more like a fiance than a wife . ALKMENA ( Horrified ) What are you doing ? AMPHITRYON ( Kisses her again ) And now you 're coming with me . ( Starts to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) Yes  --  one moment  --  I 'll call you  --  my sweet  --  my lover  --  my husband . ( She exits , leaving AMPHITRYON alone . After a short pause ALKMENA calls to him from off stage ) Amphitryon ! AMPHITRYON ( Eagerly ) Yes , darling , here I am  --  ( He rushes after her . The stage is empty for a moment . Then ALKMENA re-enters from up stage . She comes down to below the couch. ) p. 87 ALKMENA ( With great satisfaction ) He is there  --  in her arms ! Let me hear no more of the wickedness of life . Let me hear no more about fate  --  neither the wiles of men nor the caprices of the gods are proof against the clear love of a faithful wife . Echo , what have I to fear from men or gods if I 'm faithful and loyal ? Tell me , Echo , you who have never contradicted me . Nothing  --  is n't that so , Echo , nothing , nothing ? ( Her arms are uplifted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Everything ! ALKMENA ( Terrified ) What ? What is that you say ? ECHO ( Relenting ) Nothing ! Nothing ! ( Reassured , ALKMENA breathes a sigh of relief . Her arms are uplifted in gratitude , her face transfigured . The curtain falls. )
