txt Composers , Authors and- Publishers did not , violate the anti-trust laws when they took steps to make the people who used the result of : their work pay for it . Why it , should have taken two years to reach this obvious conclusion - is a question almost important enough to be made the subject of another investigation , but as . the matter now is settled the incidental mystery can be ignored . It was the broadcasting folk that raised the Issue in its latest form . They took the wholly indefensible-po4 sition that what they did was not " publication , " and that therefore they should not be obliged to pay for the use of copyrighted material . They con-. tended that they helped , not harmed , the composers and authors whose productions they put on the air . They also pleaded pathetically for the listeners-in , a great army , for whose benefit the broadcasting was done . All this was irrelevant to the rights of the producers , and simply absurd were the pretensions of the broadcast- 1 ers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like others , and their object is the making of profits , directly as advertisers or indirectly through promoting the sale of receiving sets and accessories . The claim of the public to the enjoyment of copyrighted music is no better than a claim to the enjoyment of copyrighted books , and the books they do I not expect to get for nothing . When the broadcasters weakened on paying any fees whatever , , they complained that the fees charged were too high . Perhaps so , sometimes , but they are under no obligation to buy at what they consider a price too great . ) The composers and the others certainly will riot charge more than they can get . After Professor J. F. Tams , in his Pres-1 idential address to the 1 chemists in England , had talked about the threatened scarcity of gasoline if people go on buying and using automobiles at the present rate of increase , he turned to two other perils confronting society . These are the dangers and inoon. veniences ' arising from the enormous ' growth of cemeteries and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dead ' on the living received more than passing mention , though In the vicinity a all the great modern cities the fact that too much land has to be dAvoted to graves has been noted often . The obvious remedy is cremation , but who would suggest that as the thing to do with books and documents more or less official and historic ? Delvers into the doings of long past ages have complained bitterly at the scarcity of material in the form of contemporaneous records , but now the trouble is just the opposite . The historian of events at all recent is overwhelmed by the mass of printed paper through which he must go if his information is to approach completeness . and the librarians are almost appalled by the ever increasing task of finding shelf room for the endless accumulation of what their predecessors would have regarded as precious . Nobody feels safe in throwing away things that in time may become valuable , yet ' It is impossible to go on piling up greater and greater quantities , much of which certainly never will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers of larger issue . They value highly their files of back numbers , but a single week makes a big volume , and a year almost fills a room  --  or will before long . Libraries and Cemeteries . TOPICS OF THE TIMES . Nobody who be.Right at Last , lieves in copyThough right  --  treating Long Aboullt. producers of liter ? ature , music - and other forms of what is called , art like other . producers  --  in other words , nobody who upholds common honesty , can fail to be glad that the Department of Justice has decided that the members of ' the American Society , of Insurance is much more of a gambling game in England than it is here , or at any ? ' rate companies there are willing to take risks in matters concerning which the actuaries can not give much help in determining the proper rates to charge . As queer as any of the many queer things for which insurance against loss can be obtained over there is reported in the Shape of a policy for " more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws are repealed or materially amended . Such a policy can be wanted only by a person or company that is exporting alcoholic liquors to be smuggled into this country in violation of those laws , and this one , it is admitted , was taken out by a ' group of enterprising persons who are engaged in that - not very admirable activity . The fact that they do not want us to abandon prohibition is obvious , ' and it ought to give cause for some thought to the good folk who assume that such legislation is hated by all the people who are engaged in the liquor business . It is hated by some of them , no doubt , but to others  --  not a few  --  it is a Source of enormous profits , and they want those profits to continue . One wonders what was paid by the British rum-runners for the $50,000 worth of safety . If proportioned to the prospect of prohibition 's ending here within a year , it ought not to have been more than 5 cents , if as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety is about the only source of hope in , sight for the anti-prohibitionists . If the ' bootleggers , foreign or domestic , are scared there must be some danger ahead , and they ought to know . - ? Probably no visiting royalty ever made a better impression here than did the guest who sailed away from the Pacific Coast for Honolulu this week . That GUSTAF ADOLF was more popular here than the Prince of WALES , or even as much so , hardly could be maintained , but that is because he is not a figure quite so young and picturesque . Just the  --  sarne , everything he did and said while here was pleasing to all his hosts , and to the great public that read about his daily movements about the country . That his interests in . us were of the more serious sort certainly was nothing against him , and it truthfully can be said that he increased ' and made warmer the friendship between , his country and ours .
