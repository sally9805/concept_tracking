The little heartbreak takes place in a rococo jeweler 's shop . The shop is elegantly small and elegantly polished . The few jewels and the few pieces of brocade are tossed from surface to surface in a world of glass , from the chandelier to the mirrors and from the mirrors to the cases . It is royalty 's own place of purchase , and the great egotistical head is present in bust and in miniature and on the backs of spoons . The old jeweler , enigmatic and smiling , is suddenly called to the door by a great clatter . A girl enters borne on the shoulders of a boy little older than herself . La Gracile is thin and pinch-faced , but long penury has only made her the more elfin . Illness is already writing its progress in the eyes and on the brow of Quinte . But they are deliciously happy and full of their secrets . Quinte lifts her onto the counter and draws back . LA GRACILE While you are with me I need never touch the ground . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your gravestone will be inscribed : " Here lies an exquisite dancer , she who never touched the ground . " LA GRACILE And beside mine yours will read : " Here lies her husband , the soul of her life , the sole of her shoes . " THE JEWELER Mademoiselle is in pain ? The feet of mademoiselle are in pain ? p. 3 LA GRACILE ( After she has recovered , with Quinte , from the whirlwind of intimate amusement that this preposterous idea has caused them : ) No . I am the new dancer . I am La Gracile . Except when I dance I wear nothing on my feet but little velvet pockets . So when I am not wearing my practice slippers , my husband carries me about . THE JEWELER Oh , you are La Gracile . We have already heard of your great success last night . The king is delighted with you . LA GRACILE ( Shrilly , clapping her hands : ) Yes , yes , yes . I was a great success . Even the king 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on my foot . They call me the moth of Versailles . THE JEWELER And now the king has sent you here to choose a present for yourself . LA GRACILE How did you know ? THE JEWELER The king sends to me for a gift every young lady who pleases him . Madame d'Hautillon was here last . LA GRACILE ( Chattering on : ) I want nothing myself . It is to be for Quinte . A chronometer , please , that strikes every hour with a gavotte and midnight with a saraband . QUINTE Nothing for me , Claire-Louise . When my cough returns it will shake every ornament off me , the buttons from my coat , the rings from my thin fingers . You must have something in pearls . p. 4 LA GRACILE Silly Quinte , I want nothing . QUINTE But I suppose You must wear something for the king . LA GRACILE ( Suddenly under a passing cloud of melancholy , resting her cheek on his hair , plaintively : ) I do not want a great showy pin on my breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved Brittany , from Grandmother 's field that had too many stones . QUINTE Tell her what you have , Monsieur Jeweler . THE JEWELER Mademoiselle will look at this chain ? Its art is secret . It is painted gold , the work of aged nuns in Hamburg . QUINTE Oh look , Claire-Louise , this flower for your hair . Many topazes were splintered to powder on the wheel before this perfect one . THE JEWELER Etiquette forbids , mademoiselle , your buying that ; it happens to be the very thing that Madame d'Hautillon bought for herself . LA GRACILE ( Arousing herself , imperiously : ) Have you a little fat chronometer with many jewels in it ? THE JEWELER ( Proffering a tray : ) The best in Paris . LA GRACILE ( Giving one to Quinte : ) That is for you , Quinte , from myself and from the dull king . Like my thoughts , it will rest on your heart , but long after it is sold as wire and rust my love will go on in the land where clocks do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 QUINTE ( With tears : ) Claire-Louise , it can be of no pleasure to me . In a while it will only please me because it is a little cool in my hot hand . LA GRACILE ( Softly , in pain : ) Courage , dearest Quinte , courage . THE JEWELER ( Interrupting formally : ) Remember , mademoiselle , that etiquette demands that you will choose a present that His Majesty will admire on you . LA GRACILE ( Stormily : ) I shall choose what I please . THE JEWELER ( Insinuatingly : ) Your life is only to please the king . He has chosen you . By sending you here he is telling you that . LA GRACILE You are mistaken But I am only a poor thin dancer that that has worked too hard . Besides , this is my husband . THE JEWELER ( Smiling : ) No , mademoiselle , he is not your husband . ( La Gracile jumps down and walks away weeping bitterly , her little feet-sacks flopping against the polished floor . She suddenly turns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Brittany I shall scratch his eyes out . ( The Jeweler smiles at this foolish notion and leans across the counter , holding toward her a great jewel-encrusted buckle. ) p. 6 LA GRACILE ( Wildly : ) Even though all Versailles kill me with steel pins , Quinte shall have the watch . ( But he has fallen among the gilt chairs. )
