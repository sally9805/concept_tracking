Baseball is the chief interest of Japanese sporting bloods . Eighty thousand Nipponese gather to watch schoolboy baseball games . Each summer day on the Eastern Island crowds stand in the streets of town and city to hear the latest baseball scores . During the late World Series , to which Japanese newspaper correspondents travelled 8,000 miles . Japanese excitement eclipsed that shown in Manhattan or St. Louis . Were the World Series played in Japan , it would be necessary to hollow out the crater of Fujiyama to provide a stadium of suitable dimensions . <P> Aware of this condition , the smartest of ballplayers , Tyrus Raymond Cobb* in company with George A. Putnam , Pacific coast baseball magnate , and Ernest C. Quigley , National League umpire , three months ago sailed from San Francisco to Japan . Last week having toured the country lecturing on baseball subjects at Keio , Waseda , Meiji and Osaka ( four leading universities which , with a Japanese newspaper , paid for his trip ) and having played nine baseball games in the capacity of first baseman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Ty Cobb played baseball in Japan as a member of the teams of above named colleges , against their rivals . Usually , the team of which he was a member won the game and this was not due to the fact that Umpire Quigley was officiating . The reason was a more significant one : <P> The Japanese are not very good baseball players . However hard they try , there is some gymnastic constraint in little yellow Japanese frames which makes it impossible for them to throw and catch without an awkwardness . They are at their best in running and sliding between bases ; their feet are quick and they give little birdlike cries on arriving safely , or shrill furious ones when they are tagged . The terminology of baseball in Japan is identical with that in the U. S. ; it is strange to hear the hordes of rooters , their eyes swimming with suspense , abusing pitchers in their own tongue but calling on the batter to ' ' swat a homer . " <P> The Japanese are ardent sports ; they play hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they . Thus Gehrig , Tilden , Tunney , Ruth are far greater names to them than that of Tsunenohana , their champion wrestler . Japanese baseball addicts possess a faculty which U.S. fans in some measure lack : they like to play as well as watch . Japanese players , unlike U.S. ones who speak largely of golf , poker and guzzling , like to hear about their U.S. counterparts . The little pitchers have big ears and the catchers wait anxiously every day to hear what is doing with big league catchers in Chicago . To them , the Yankees have always been as splendid as ancestors and the Giants have been a team of nine enormous men , as swift as birds , galloping upon a desert of turf and walloping a moonlike ball with tree-trunks . <P> Although 20,000 persons were usually on hand to watch him play , and though the curious cries of the Japanese enthusiasts , who greeted him as Babe Ruth 's cousin , must have helped convince him that he had not passed his prime , Ty Cobb , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retiring from professional baseball . He said that he was not considering becoming the manager of any big league team ; he will go for a hunting trip soon and after that he will spend a year in touring Europe . <P>
