Receivers were appointed by the Federal Court for the American Fuel Oil Company , a $30,000,000 concern with $20,000,000 outstanding stock . The company was organized in 1918 to buy , sell , develop and transport fuel and crude oil . Its failure is attributed by the president of the company , Harry M. Rubey , in part to the United States Shipping Board . The company purchased at $185 per ton five Hog Island freighters which , although represented as in good condition , proved practically useless when converted into tankers at a cost of $1,000,000.
