Alice Economics CURRENT economic notions may be rep ? resented by a series of Mad Hatter riddles . Thus : Q. Why is everybody ruined ? A. Because the country is rich . Q. How shall the country impoverish itself in order that people may prosper again ? A. We must sell our surplus abroad to people abroad who can not pay . Q. That is lending . When the foreign countries pay us back we shall be truly rich ? A. No , indeed . We can not afford to let them pay us back , for we should then be worse off titan ever . It/c ha- , : e already too much of our own . That is why we are ruined . And this is the stuff that rules the world I From text books one has learned that when man solves the original economic problem of filling his belly with less than his whole labor he may begin to act upon his environment in an imaginative man ? ner to transform it . After that his progress in opulence is limited only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product of labor applied to materials . Perfect theory ! But what is the news that tills us with direful uneasiness ? We are suddenly in ? volved in an economic calamity of the first magnitude . The causes are reported at length in the newspapers . They are One : There is more food than we can eat . Two : There is a disastrous surplus of the materials upon which labor acts to produce wealth , such as cotton , wool , leather , metals and chemicals . Three : There are more machines than can be kept busy ; thousands are idle for want of new orders . Four : There are more men than jobs . THE NEW Our tills are empty and our sources of credit in the Federal Reserve System are dry . " Hence the demand that the Federal Reserve Board shall invent more credit and give it to the banks to be loaned on unsaleable goods . This is in effect a demand that the credit raising power of the government shall be exercised to guarantee the seller his profit , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawn until the time , when , if and as , they may be sold for more than the mythical cost of production . In that case of course the cost of production would never fall . " Well , " says the farmer , " has n't the govern ? ment guaranteed the profits of the railroads ? Is there any reason why it should n't guarantee ours ? " No reason . None at all . We are in Wonder ? land , where we do n't have to give reasons , If he could get enough credit to hold on with , the seller 's only other problems would be : // be able to repay her huge debt to us in commodities , and then protect our industries against the com ? petition of those commodities by prohibitive tariffs . The wool growers now are demanding an em ? bargo against foreign wool and the farmers an embargo against Canadian wheat , because other countries are trying to pay us something on ac ? count in wool and wheat . Charles H. Sabin , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the demands of do ? mestic consumption in the United States this year , for example , has been estimated at 2,000 , cx ) 4 ) bales of cotton , 300000,000 bushels of wheat , $750,00e1.000 worth of semi-manufactured raw materials and finished manufac ? tured products , and $250,000,000 worth of packing house products . If the American producer is to be pros ? perous he must continue to have open to him the foreign markets to which he has been exporting so heavily . First , to compel the buyer , at home and abroad ; Second , to keep foreign sellers out . The American market is large , if you can wait for it ; but there is the world market besides . The world is thought to be generally short of goods . The difficulty is that it has n't the money to buy them with . Therefore , it is urged that the govern ? ment , either directly or through its War Finance Corporation , and the banks through agencies to be created for that purpose , shall borrow money from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American goods with . If you say : " But foreign countries already owe us some fifteen billions they can not pay , " the answer is : " Of course they ca n't pay . They never can pay in money . Everybody knows that . They never can pay in goods , either , unless we lend them a great deal more to set them on their feet . If now we let them have food and materials on long term credit they will be able to restore their pro ? cesses of production and ultimately pay us back in commodities . " This has a persuasive sound until one thinks of the next proposal , which is that tariff barriers shall be set against foreign merchandise because it is cheap and competes with dear goods in the home market . Europe is already beginning to pay a lit ? tle on account , in commodities , but no sooner have these commodities appeared than a cry has been raised that we shall be deluged with the products of low-wage foreign labor , to the ruin of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall sell to Europe on credit in order that she may Mr. James Brown , of the banking house of Brown Bros . &; Co. , reviewing the situation , says : We must keep our minds on the power of Europe to throw manufactured goods into this country . . There is a great opportunity for Europe to dump her surplus over here , or into countries where sales are made in competition with us . England , and in some lines France and Belgium , arc going to be keen competitors of ours , and I should not be at all surprised to see textiles , steel and some other manufactured goods coming into this country at prices which we shall not be able to meet . We shall lend foreign countries money to enable them to buy from us commodities the same as those which they are about to begin dumping upon us at prices which we shall be unable to meet , ? to buy from us staple commodities with which they are already beginning to undersell us in our own market , ? to buy 300,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? bargo against Canadian wheat because it is cheaper than our own ! This is where Alice says : " Curiouser and curiouser ! " In Chicago a few days ago three hundred bank ? ers met to organize a corporation to finance for ? eign trade , as the phrase is , or , as the newspaper reporters more simply put it , " to pay American exporters cash for goods sold to foreign buyers who are unable to pay cash . " Herbert I Toover addressed the meeting . He said : Even if we extend these credits and if upon Europe , .. s recovery we then attempt to exact the payment of these , . sums by import of commodities , we shall have introduced a competition with our own industries that cannot. he turned back by any tariff wall . I helicve have today an equipment and a skill in productilen ? hat e ' yield us a surplus of commodities for export beyond any compensation we can usefully tale by way of imported commodities , . Gold and remittances and services can not cover this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one remedy , and that is by the system atic permanent investment of our surplus production in reproductive works abroad . We thus reduce the return we must receive to a return of interest and profit . These are significant words . They mean that in Mr. Hoover 's opinion our need to sell surplus goods abroad is and henceforth will be greater than the capacity of our foreign debtors to pay . They can not return the principal in gold , money or serv ? ices . That is out Of the question . They can not return it in goods , either , but if they could it would be disastrous for us , since then we should suffer a deluge of foreign commodities " in compe ? tition with our own industries . " The only way , therefore , is to make a " systematic permanent in ? vestment of our surplus production abroad , " and receive back , never the principal , but only the in ? terest and profit . Mr. Hoover is not a banker . He may think out loud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He disposes of the principal of our for ? eign loans . The debtors can not return it and we can not afford to receive it back . But the interest and profit which he says we may receive , ? that will have to be paid in commodities , as the principal would be if it were paid at all . What shall we do when the volume of foreign commodities received in payment of interest and profit becomes very large and our industries cry for protection ? Mr. Hoover said : " It is vital to every work ? man in the United States that Europe shall recover her standard of living , or we shall he dragged down to the European standard . " If that be true , ? if the only way to restore the standard of living in Europe is for the United States to lend heavily , though we shall never see the principal again and perhaps can not afford to receive even the interest and profit , then it follows that loans to Europe are not an investment at all but a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This view , whether you accept it or not , delivers one from the circular absurdity of the proposition that in order to save our prosperity we must lend our surplus away and then lock the debtors out . It lifts the argument to the plane of politics . Worse confusion there begins . Are we not all a little drunk ? . . . credit drunk ? ... profit drunk ? . trade drunk ? If as a matter of national policy we resolve to lend more to Europe , willing beforehand to call the principal uncollectible and to forego if need be even the payment of interest and profit , all for a greater good that may not be calculated in percent ? ages , that is a thing in itself and should be debated in its own terms . But as we talk , it is another thing entirely . The American producer who advocates borrow ? ing money from the American people and lending it to foreign countries in order that they may buy his goods at prices supported by an unlimited dis ? pensation of Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep foreigners from selling to American consumers , is consistent only in mind ? ing his own profit . He is casting about desperately for any means to extricate himself from the losses entailed by a drastic readjustment of prices . His concern for the future of Europe is extremely oblique . And he is only twice as myopic as the stewards of credit , namely , the bankers , who say : " We can ? not continue to expand credit at home to support prices , for that way lies disaster . But we can give credit to foreign countries and you shall find profit ? able markets abroad for this ruinous surplus of American goods . " They forget , if they ever knew , that when people have of their own a surplus of things to eat and wear they may act upon their environment to im ? prove it . They forget that to rebuild and develop our neglected transportation system , to reclaim by drainage and irrigation our own swamp and arid lands in area greater than France , and to make the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and capital than can be found in two generations . They forget , if they ever knew , that they have any responsibility for planning such works ahead and holding them in suspense for a time like now . They succeed only in concealing the fact that the present sense of disaster is a familiar delusion arising from extreme alternations of high and low prices , which entail waste , panic , want and social calamity . These alternations are unnecessary . They result from a petty , selfish , repetitious , un ? imaginative , uncreative use of credit for immediate profit . They ignore the damning fact that they finance the booms . They lend the credit that inflates prices . There is no other way for it to hapr.m . You never heard of a meeting of hankers to dis ? cuss ways and means of abating anarchistic specula ? tion in prices . That is the root of the evil , and they do not bother about it . Why should they ? Whatever else happens , banking as it goes is much more profitable than @ @ @ @ @ @
