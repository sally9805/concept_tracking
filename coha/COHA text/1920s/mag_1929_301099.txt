" I christen thee v-5 ! " <P> Delicately cracking a bottle of grape juice over its Gloucester fisherman 's bow . Mrs. Charles Francis Adams , wife of the Secretary of the Navy , solemnly pronounced these words at Portsmouth , N. H. , last week as the Navy 's largest submarine slid down the stocks and out upon the Piscataqua River . Beside her stood her son , Charles Francis Adams Jr . and Admiral Charles F. Hughes , Chief of Naval Operations . Snow was falling on her fur coat , on her bouquet of roses . Navy men pressed about her solicitously , to shield her from the storm . <P> Navy Yard workmen who had built the V-5 gave Mrs. Adams a silver platter on which was an engraved likeness of their handiwork . The V-5 is a long-range cruising vessel , 371 feet long , with a surface displacement of 2,760 tons. * She will be commissioned next May . Plans were hastened for starting construction on her twin , the V-7 . <P> On the day the V-5 took the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special submarine school at New London , Conn. , to help man this growing arm of national defense . <P> These naval activities , of course , in no wise reduced the determination of Secretary of State Henry Lewis Stimson and other U. S. delegates to the London Naval Conference to talk Japan 's delegates out of their demands for large submarine tonnage . With nice new bags and trunks ceremoniously packed by his wife who remained behind in Tokyo , onetime Japanese Premier Reijiro Wakatsuki had brought his delegation to Washington for a brief diplomatic visit on the way to London . To his suburban home , Woodley , Statesman Stimson invited Delegates Wakatsuki and Takarabe , there with U. S. Delegate Morrow , discussed naval matters with them for 150 minutes . Not to embarrass the Japanese with a preponderance of U. S. delegates , Secretary of the Navy Adams did not attend . <P> The Japanese naval demands : 1 ) 70% of the largest auxiliary fleet allowed the U. S. or Britain ; 2 ) a flexible interchange of auxiliary tonnage between categories ; 3 ) retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons ) . Like good diplomats , they were ready to give in on demands No. 1 and 2 but on demand No. 3 all the persuasiveness of Statesman Stimson could not bridge them to compromise . Vainly Mr. Stimson tried to show them that submarines were useless against battleships , that they served only as weapons of uncivilized warfare against unarmed merchantmen . Possibly the Japanese interpreter failed to translate the full vigor of the Secretary 's arguments ; perhaps the Japanese delegates were really intent on holding their position on submarines . In any event no agreement was reached . <P> The evening the Japanese delegates were dining in state with President Hoover at the White House , the presses of the Washington Post were reeling off a sly editorial which next morning rudely jarred the polite placidity of the Washington conversations .
