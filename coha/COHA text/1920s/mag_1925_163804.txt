Governess Miriam A. Ferguson 's prospects of escaping impeachment ( TIME , Nov. 30 , Dec. 7 ) brightened last week . To be sure one additional charge was leveled at her . The State Textbook Commission , of which she is chairman and of which her husband at her instigation was appointed clerk , recently made a contract for supplying all the spellers used in state schools for the next six years . The contract involves the greater part of $1,000,000 . With four companies bidding , the contract was awarded to the highest bidder but against the advice of the Attorney General , who declared the contract was illegal . <P> But the Fergusons stuck to their guns . Governess Ferguson announced positively that she would not call a special session of the legislature : <P> " Let them assemble if they want to . Let them start something . I 'll be here at the finish . <P> " Now , about this special session they want me to call . They tried to camouflage it as an inquiry into the foot and mouth disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a bird . It 's my feet , my mouth , and my eradi- cation they want . Some of them call me a dumbbell . They will soon find out how dumb I am . " <P> As to the prospect of the Speaker of the Legislature summoning an impeachment session , even that project was damped . By a legal anomaly , such a session would not have power to appropriate money for its own expenses . Speaker Lee Satterwhite announced that he has promises of private citizens to contribute $300,000 for the expenses of the session , and Jim Ferguson turned on him with the cry of " Slush fund ! " In addition it was realized that , even if the state House of Representatives impeached the Governess , Jim Ferguson has probably sufficient strength in the Senate to prevent her being removed from office . Then two new Road Commissioners were appointed-men of high character-to replace the two who resigned under fire for wasting state funds . That seemed to lessen the need for removing the Governess . Then the Attorney General made public an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to have the expenses for an impeachment session of the legislature paid out of private pockets . <P> So , while it did not seem that the attacks on the Fergusons would cease , last week 's developments indicated that there would be no impeachment proceedings against the Governess .
