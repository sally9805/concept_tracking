In the days of Hill and Harriman the West was treated to great spectacles in the building up of great railway systems . Then came the Government with the heavy hand of law , and all but extinguished the race of railway builders and consolidators . Times have changed . Now the Government smiles where it formerly frowned . Consolidations are once more in order . In the East the Van Sweringens are always good for a rumor of consolidation . There is talk of the Pennsylvania and the Norfolk coming to an agreement . But what of the West ? Who are the leaders who make up consolidations there ? Hale Holden , President of the C. B. &; Q. is one . He has advocated that the 62 railway systems west of the Mississippi should be consolidated in four great systems . That would be a project of Herculean proportions . <P> Without going into the public ways crying a panacea , without driving hope and conjecture ahead of what appears as legitimate possibility , yet taking a definite and most effective part in the consolidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern Pacific Railroad . <P> " This man Sproule " who is anything but a self-advertiser , is apparently getting results , quietly as he always does . He came to this country with an education , an affable disposition and ability that went straight to the mark . He began as a freight clerk on the Southern Pacific . In the course of 24 years of continuous service in the company he rose to the position of Traffic Manager . Then the Guggenheims , ever watchful for talent , secured him as traffic manager-member of the executive committee for the American Smelting and Refining Co . Then the Wells Fargo Express Co. got him for its President . In 1911 the Southern Pacific which had got along without Sproule for five years decided it could get along without him no longer . Sproule went back , as President of the road . <P> There Sproule was closely associated with Julius Kruttschnitt , chairman of the line , except for a brief period when the Government controlled the railways and he was a District Director . Now , again President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman . When Huntington , founder of the road , died , Harriman bought control by way of uniting the Southern Pacific with his Union Pacific . Later this union was undone when the Union Pacific sold its Southern Pacific holdings . <P> The old consolidation , the old dream of unity , is at an end . But the new ? The times and the Government call for consolidation . There must be new dreams of rolling stock and a right of way spreading over the great plains . William Sproule is pushing toward the goal . <P> The negotiations are well under way for a merger between the Southern Pacific and the El Paso and Southwestern . The acquisition of this road will give the Southern Pacific a new outlet into Mexico . It will also connect the Southern Pacific directly with Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific . Following the El Paso merger , the next step naturally will be a merger with the Rock Island . That would give the Southern Pacific a direct line into Chicago , what it has always desired . <P> Speaking last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
