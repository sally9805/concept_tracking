To Myron C. Taylor was given last week credit for finishing what the late great John Pierpont Morgan began . Mr. " Taylor , brilliant chairman of the finance committee of U. S. Steel , announced that , at their annual meeting on April 15 , stockholders would be asked to approve an increase in authorized common stock from some 7,500,000 to 12,500,000 , thereby potentially capitalizing the company at $1,250,000,000 . From new stock to be issued at terms to be fixed , cash will be received to redeem all the bonds of the parent company . Thus Steel common becomes " as good as a bond , " which was the astoundingly imaginative ambition of Steel 's Creator Morgan . <P> Steel began in 1901 with a staggering load of bonds , capitalization being ( in millions ) : <P> Bonds $303 Preferred stock 445 Common 443 <P> Total $1,191 <P> Most of the bonds went to Andrew Carnegie , who intended to make Mr. Morgan pay well for his dream . The stock was full of water and sold as low as $3 per share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company went the earnings . In fact , Steel 's accountants even provided for sinking funds before figuring their earnings . Thus inevitably was the Morgan faith in the U. S. justified and long since has U. S. common sold steadily above par and above its preferred . The only question now is " when will it hit $200 ? " <P> Total stock to be issued will probably not greatly exceed $1,000,000,000 in par value . But the offering price of the new stock may well be $150 per share , the same U. S. common which once was water and which the late great Judge Elbert H. Gary had already expanded by a 40% stock dividend shortly before he died in 1927 . The new capitalization also removes the last traces of Carnegie ; for although he had provided that some of the bonds should never be retired , most of the holders of the special Carnegie bonds have agreed to cash in for $115.
