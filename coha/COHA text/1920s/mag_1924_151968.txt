Commissar Lunacharsky , Minister of Education , spent three whole hours in Moscow last week , impressing the Central Executive Committee of the urgent need of the intellectually starved masses for education . <P> Since 1922 , he said , a great decline in the general level of education has set in . Before the War , Russia had 62,000 elementary schools and 4,500,000 pupils . Shortly after the 1917 Revolution , there were 76,000 schools and 6,000,000 pupils . But , in 1922 , there were only 49,000 schools and 3,500,000 pupils . He drew a like picture of the secondary schools . <P> In the rural districts , he said , schools are sparsely attended because the buildings are badly equipped and unheated , and because parents are too poor to buy shoes for their children to walk to school in and too poor to buy textbooks , etc . <P> The Central Executive adopted a 21-point resolution calling for higher wages for teachers and the consolidation of elementary and secondary schools .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
