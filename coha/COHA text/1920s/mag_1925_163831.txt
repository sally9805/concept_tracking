In Manhattan and the surrounding suburbs live some 5,000 Buddhists . They go about their business much as the members of other religions except that they do not broadcast their holy services over the radio or issue weekly advertisements announcing what topics their priests will preach about . Last week , however , two Buddhists- C. Juandoo and Fernand E. Querroy-called on the Commissioner of Parks , one Francis D. Gallatin . They asked him if he would permit them to erect a shrine to Buddha in Central Park . They had with them handsome plans for the shrine , designed by another member of their group , Jules Laget . The Commissioner of Parks was impressed . He agreed to submit the proposal to the Municipal Art Commission . The press got hold of the story , published a small item-and immediately , from a dozen pulpits and synagogs , came some amazing demonstrations . <P> Some dominies were humorous . Buddha , they readily grasped , was something to joke about-a funny cross-legged little figure like a Billiken . Others were taciturn , others sorrowful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were agreed - it would be a horrible thing to permit the effigy of so noted an infidel to appear in the midst of a Christian city . It would be like reminding men of the lost rites of Astarte , like resurrecting the god , Priapus , or setting up the image of the Golden Bull of Tyre . <P> Dr. Christian F. Reisner of the Methodist Church said : <P> " It is ridiculous . This is a Christian land . No religion on earth teaches the brotherhood of man but the Christian religion . No one would think of permitting this . A sect that decrees its girl babies to be thrown into ash cans ! Moreover , we put up statues of our saints as reminders . But a statue of Buddha is a shrine to be worshiped . " <P> Rabbi Stephen S. Wise was one of those who lightly indulged his wit : <P> " I wonder whether the proposal to erect a statue in Central Park to Buddha comes from Will Rogers . It is quite worthy of his fertile wit . Buddha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with Confucius , to say nothing of Bab ? And there is a sect called the Mormons , and there was Mrs. Eddy . What 's the matter with any or all of these ? <P> " Let 's have a nice , quiet lane in Central Park to be set apart for the figures of religious founders from Buddha to the Bab , and let the devotees of these masters meet in friendly disputation with the soon- to-be ex-Mayor Hylan as umpire or Comptroller Craig as alternate . <P> " We have a Hall of Fame . Why not have the mall-not hall-occupied by the figures we have made , and over it all be there invoked the spirit of Mark Twain or Oliver Wendell Holmes ( father , not son ) to do the irenic company ample justice . <P> " Three cheers for Buddha ! " <P> The Rev. Dr. J. Lane Miller , pastor of the Hanson Place Methodist Episcopal Church ( Brooklyn ) , viewed the incident as a challenge to Christians of the U. S. to consider " how their own country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Roman Catholic Church of the Nativity ( Brooklyn ) said : " I think we should keep the statue of Buddha out of the park by all means .
