WHO has not heard o : the one-time mistress of the seas , the Boston-built clipper ship Flying Cloud ? Yet few outside the ship-building industry and those engaged in the shipping business know anything at all of Donald McKay , the man who brought her and many other famous sailing ships into being Fame , always a whimsical jade , has been neglectful of McKay , ignoring the fact that he was as surely a genius as any artist , poet , composer or inventor that ever fathered a masterpiece . His dreams were of noble things , and he wove them into a sturdy fabric of beams and spars , canvas and halyards . McKay was the most inspired and the most enterprising builder of his time , and that , as regards sailing craft , means that he was the greatest of all time . His glorious creations were gliding from the ways in the golden age of wind-propelled ocean carriers . It was in the period just preceding the dominance of steam . Besides Flying Cloud he sponsored a whole fleet of gallant vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Westward Ho , Great Republic , and other record breakers for speed and size . To see McKay in his true light , shipping conditions of his time must be considered . When he came to the United States from Nova Scotia in 1816 he was a lad of sixteen . Mercantile nations  | were then engaged in a struggle for trade supremacy , with America slowly but surely gaining the ascendancy . Superior seamanship gave the New World republic advantages over Old World powers in her early determination to glean a fair share of shipping plums . A Yankee skipper would drive ahead , night and day , whatever the weather , until a trip was completed . This was contrary to old established procedure , which called for furling sail at sundown or at the first indication of rough seas . McKay served a five-year apprenticeship in New York with Isaac Webb , who in his day was called the " Father of American Ship-builders . " The packet ship was then in vogue , and the young man from Nova Scotia was later to bring this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was with the clipper ship that he won preeminent distinction . During his free lance days , as a journeyman shipwright in and about New York City , McKay met and married the daughter of a prominent ship-builder . He also made the acquaintance of John Willis Griffiths , who originated the clipper design . Griffiths , a gray-eyed , thoughtful young fellow , was a draftsman in a yard adjoining the one in which McKay was employed . The two exchanged many ideas that later brought renown to both . At thirty-one McKay entered into partnership with a builder at Newburyport , Massachusetts . In the very first ship of his own designing he demonstrated the ability that was to set him in the foremost rank of marine architects . This was the packet Courier , built for the South American coffee trade , and though having a tonnage of only three hundred and eighty tons , few craft then afloat surpassed her in speed . The Courier was a bright feather in America 's nautical cap , but by no means the brightest that Donald McKay was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at one time obliged by taunting employees to give up working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard because of his alien birth . At the earnest solicitation of Boston 's foremost shipping merchant , Enoch Train , McKay transferred his activities from Newburyport to Boston , and built for him the famous White Diamond Line of Boston and Liverpool packets . In 1846 he produced the packet New World , then the largest merchant ship that had come off the ways . A flood of commissions poured in upon him . To meet demands he was obliged to revolutionize manufacturing methods . He erected derricks and steam sawmills in his yard , thereby  | replacing brawn with labor- and time-saving mechanical devices . Curiously , it was steam , an element McKay utilized at this epoch , that eventually was the undoing of the sailing vessel . Though McKay introduced mass production into the industry , and took much of the romance out of a once colorful profession , he never regarded the output of his yard as merchandise . Like a sailorman , he saw more in a ship than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divine creation , a personality , a thing with a soul . Otherwise how did it occur to him to create such majestic beings as Stag Hound , Sovereign of the Seas , Lightning , and Great Republic ? The discovery of gold in California spurred McKay to what many believed to be his greatest achievement , the clipper Flying Cloud . He afterward built larger and faster ships but none with more grace or beauty than this white-winged queen . The rush of immigration to the western El Dorado in the late forties opened new roads to wealth for American shippers . From four vessels clearing at Atlantic ports for San Francisco in 1847 , the number increased to seven hundred and seventy-five in 1849 . Rates soared sky-high and profits of a single trip often paid the cost of a ship . Into the mad Western scramble McKay sent Flying Cloud . With an angel for a figurehead and full billowing sails that gave the appearance of wings , she must have appeared like Neptune 's own daughter to captains and crews that saw her sweeping on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedier craft , a craft more responsive to man 's will than Flying Cloud never sailed the waves .

Up to her time a prettier , a speedier craft , a craft more responsive to man 's will than Flying Cloud never sailed the waves . To this day few  | ships have surpassed her in aesthetic harmony of line . Her two record trips of eighty-nine days from New York to San Francisco around Cape Horn have yet to be equalled by a wind-driven vessel . Lightning and James Baines , launched near the close of McKay 's career , were speedier ships than Flying Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-six miles in twentyfour hours and the Baines established sailing records that are still unsurpassed . Old sea-dogs recall that " Bully " Forbes , Lightning 's skipper , swore to do " Melbourne or hell in sixty days . " He nearly made the first port in the time specified ; there is no record as to the second . McKay 's Great Republic , length three hundred and thirty-five feet , was the largest extreme clipper ship ever built . The day she slipped into the " ocean 's arms , " October 4 , 1853 , Boston declared a holiday . The quoted words are from Longfellow 's poem " The Building of the Ship , " which is said to have been inspired by scenes observed by the poet on his many visits to McKay 's East Boston yard . The builder of ships , on his part , it is declared , drew from his friend 's verses the inspiration that led to the creation of the awesome Great Republic . The Great Republic was so large that she overwhelmed the imagination . No one dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKay , with the same indomitable courage that characterized his mechanical achievements , embarked his fortune in her , some $300,000 , a huge sum in those days . She was towed to New York , where , on December 17 , 1853 , she caught fire and burned to the water 's edge in the East River . Rebuilt , the monster clipper made a record maiden ocean voyage to England in 1855 . Her skipper , Captain Limeburner , narrated in later years how visitors that came aboard would ask " whether he left any lumber for ship-building in the United States or had brought it all with him . " In 1875 McKay closed the gates of the shipyard that had produced " such vessels as had never been and never will be again . " Until he crossed to the Far Shore five years later , the Ameican master of sailing-ship construction lived on a farm at Hamilton , Massachusetts , where in futile endeavors to wring a living from New England 's barren soil he expended his last energy .  |      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
