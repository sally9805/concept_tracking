Youth is brave , but youth is cruel . Last week , two dozen young Negroes of Gary , Ind. , were mortified by 1,357 young whites of Gary , Ind. , probably more painfully than any adult Negro ever lynched by rabid adult whites . <P> The thing began when the pupils of Emerson High School returned to their classes and found the 24 Negroes enrolled in their midst . Emerson High School is in the " nice " residential section of Gary . It has never before had more than four or five Negro pupils . But during the summer , Gary 's school districts were redefined . Because they lived where they did , the 24 Negroes were entitled by law to attend Emerson High School . <P> Law or no law , the Emerson pupils whispered , gestured , glowered at the dusky newcomers . They told their parents , who protested to Superintendent William A. Wirt and Principal A. E. Spaulding , who said nothing could be done . " Segregation is impossible because of economic reasons , " said Mr. Wirt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior class , glib talker , good swimmer , got together with Jack Keener , sleek cheerleader , and Sam Chase , smart debater , and some of the athletically " big men " of Emerson , to talk things over . Result : on Monday morning , instead of attending classes , some 800 Emersonians in floppy trousers , sporty sweaters , trim skirts and fetching blouses , went shouting and laughing through Gary 's business section . Police disbanded them for " obstructing traffic " but many of them later stood around outside Emerson High School , hissing , gibing , catcalling at nonstriking students when school let out . Policemen saw to it that the 24 Negroes went home unmolested . <P> Next day the " nice " residential part of Gary was littered and scrawled with placards and signs : " WE WO N'T GO BACK UNTIL EMERSON IS WHITE . . . . NO NIGGERS FOR EMERSON . . . . EMERSON IS A WHITE MAN 'S SCHOOL , " etc. , etc . <P> The strikers ' ranks swelled to 900 that day . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home by nervous parents , Emerson 's seventh and eighth grades walked out , making a total of 1,357 strikers . Police broke up attempted Negro mass meetings . The school authorities threatened the strikers in vain . <P> Led by talkative Winfield Eschelman , the strikers formulated their demands at a mass meeting which the school officials attended : 1 ) Let all Negroes be segregated in corners of Emerson classrooms and in the school cafeteria . 2 ) Let no disciplinary reprisals be made upon the strikers when they should return . 3 ) Let the strikers not have to " make up " school work missed during the strike . 4 ) Let the Emerson Negroes be transferred to other schools as soon as possible . 5 ) Let an all-Negro high school be built in Gary as soon as possible . <P> The school authorities were helpless . President Ralph Snyder of the Board of Safety , representing Mayor Floyd E. Williams , arbitrated the situation and the strikers won all their demands . Magnanimous , Winfield Eschelman and friends permitted three Negro seniors to finish out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , but the rest were transferred temporarily to an all-Negro junior high school elsewhere in town . The strikers returned to classes .
