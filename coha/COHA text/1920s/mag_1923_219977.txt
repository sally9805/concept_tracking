The Deputies do not want the Washington Naval Agreement , now before the Chamber , and it seems likely that they will ask for amendments before they vote for ratification . <P> The press in particular shows a strong front against acceptance of the treaty as it stands : <P> Le Matin : " One hundred and seventy-five German submarines held in check the greatest naval coalition in history . How much would 175 submarines cost us ? The same price as 6 battleships . " <P> Pertinax in the Echo de Paris : " Without consulting us the representatives of England , America and Japan , sitting behind closed doors , decided that we could not have any more capital ships than a ratio of 1.75. "
