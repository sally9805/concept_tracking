Trade , now in the depths of Summer slack , faces a double speculation as to the Fall . Seasonal recovery is of course to be expected , but how far it will go remains an enigma . The basic soundness of economic conditions is undoubted and is creating wide optimism as to the future . But merchants and manufacturers would like to see something more than rosy prospects , and soon they will become impatient unless definitely auspicious signs develop , however faintly . <P> The second gamble is politics , now on the threshold of a lively Presidential campaign . The tendency has been to disregard the LaFollette movement as insignificant and unimportant , and to hold that Coolidge will win rather easily over Davis . Yet those who have taken pencil and paper , and attempted to discover just how the Republicans will get the electoral votes necessary for victory are not so certain of all this . As yet there has been no barometer-except perhaps grain price-to register political sentiment in the country .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
