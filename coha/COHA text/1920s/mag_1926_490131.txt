IF there still remains any one who thinks that motherhood in the old sense is not a thing of the past , his fond illusion will be quickly destroyed in town during the open season for gas-main hunting . The pavements have been torn up all over the city , leaving raw expanses of ground . It is Mother Earth who lies uncovered , but civilization has altered her almost beyond recognition . WE luxuriated in the country over the week-end and enjoyed many stimulating experiences . Not the least inspiring moment of the visit came when a precocious youth of the vicinity called in the evening , bringing a young boa constrictor . While we all stood on the furniture , he let the cute thing play on the living-room floor . There was something Roman about it  --  something imperial . At last , we sighed , the bazaars of the New World have equaled those of ancient times . " You can buy them at Wanamaker 's , " he said , " for $1.75 . " THE charming French motor horns which have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many years are now for sale in New York at a price within the means of taxi drivers . Their tooting note is already occasionally audible above the roar of the elevated . Although we love these horns , we know of nothing so agreeable that we can as easily dispense with . When the elevated is torn down , it will then be time enough to think of introducing some new noises in New York . THIS is August , when New York passes her nadir . The streets are crammed with strange-looking faces reminiscent of Kansas City and points west . Only the misanthropist who shudders at a familiar face and the acutely self-conscious who cringes at the approach of an acquaintance are happy . All are strangers these days . The gregarious of our race have folded up their tents and fled . RUNG , as it happens , fairly mis- anthropic and self-conscious , we have not found life unbearable so far , but nearly so . There have been moments when the masterpieces in the art gallery window have palled , the Stadium concerts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architectural monuments of the city have seemed unlovely shanties , and we have gone and gazed with passion at folding toothbrushes , rubber mattresses , and such in the windows of sporting-goods stores . It is before such gods that prayers are offered up these days . ANUMBER of genial gentlemen are , as usual at this season , on the streets in the evening , offering to the curious glimpses of the moon and planets through brass-barreled telescopes . Since we first patronized one of them , the world has been rent with wars and the price of everything has doubled . But we rejoice to note that these worthy peddlers of space have remained faithful through every vicissitude to the unchanging spirit of their heavenly spheres . The stated price is still a nickel a look . WE think we hear a nation-wide V V sigh of relief as it becomes increasing certain that Ma Ferguson , the unlovely Governor of Texas , is trembling upon the brink of oblivion . Chivalry , to be sure , dictates that we should step forward and aid a woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antics while in power urges us to offer her a helping hand . But because we have never liked Mr. Ferguson , we have decided to turn a deaf ear to these arguments and let the people of Texas do whatever they may see fit . i  --  jURDER will out , but the ultra- 1V1 respectable of our acquaintance do not usually read about it in the newspapers . We have found to our delectation this week , however , that even the most genteel and high-minded have digested every detail of the Hall murder and welcome its return to the public press . " Here at last , again , is the one murder I 've read every word of , " said one gentle lady as she entered the rush for Times and Tribune at the suburban railway station news stand . Is it the clerical touch , we wonder , that wins the ladies ? Our guess is that people of intelligence are as alive as any one else to the stirring appeal of a good melodrama and that decent folk will eventually be justified in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned annals of criminology as a murder of which we should all take cognizance . Identity THE latest story from " out West " concerns a respectable Santa Fe matron who was buying carrots at an intitnate little grocerteria . As the deal was completed and she started to leave the store , she was met by an acquaintance who had obviously not seen her for a time . The greetings were solicitous and the entering lady was heard to exclaim anxiously : " And I hear you were quite ill . " " Ill ! " replied the respectable-looking matron with the carrots . " I damn near died ! " To which the startled reproach was : " Why , Mary Austin ! " Travel Notes MR . CORNELIUS VANDERBILT , JR. , has just told us of his recent gay and profitable excursion abroad . He went , primarily , in the interests of his teeth , seeking specialists , but when he arrived in Paris the memory that he was a journalist was too much for him and he fell to interviewing people . He stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chambre des Deputes , and talked to the politicians when they strolled across to lunch at the Bourgogne between changing cabinets . Then , expanding his operations , he bought for ninety dollars a circular tourist ticket that would take him , with stop-over privileges , around the capitals of Europe . After which he sat down and wrote to every famous man he could think of , announcing that he was coming to see him . It was a great lark when you consider that Mr. Vanderbilt had never been in Europe before without the moral support of either the American Army or the Vanderbilt family . His experiences were diverting and the list of personages he gained audience with by these simple maneuvers bears testimony to the power of a good name and a little nerve . AT Rome , Mr. Vanderbilt met the Pope and his Cardinals and , after machinations , the Great Master , Mussolini . Mussolini spoke excellent English , slowly , and wore four days ' growth of beard . Italy , according to Mr. Vanderbilt , is a strange place these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on seats , fined for walking on the wrong side of the street , for speaking to strangers , for carrying too much luggage . The fine is arbitrarily imposed by the Black Shirt making the arrest . There is no trial ; if you resist , jail . The oddest penalty imposed on Mr. Vanderbilt was for calling a man on the telephone before Ile was awake . ON the train out of Rome , when Mr. Vanderbilt tried to send a note across the dining car to Signor Volpi , the card was cut in two , while still in his hand , by the knife of a gentleman sitting opposite . " In the land governed by the Great Master , " thundered the Italian , " such things arc not done . " Only time and much bribery enabled the American to get word to the Volpis , who , having been guests of his family in New York , welcomed him cordially . IMunich , Vanderbilt saw Luden- 1 dorff , and many , many thousand military gentlemen running in B. V. D. 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Leaving Warsaw after a fruitless attempt to interview General Pilsudski , hr found himself in the same compartment with M. Dyneskii , the general 's aide . They became such friends that Vanderbilt , who had never before been up in an airplane , flew back with the aide from Berlin to Warsaw , saw a sullen Pilsudski at last , and left once more , to pick up a talk with Hindenburg and Marx in Berlin and , later , with the Kaiser at Doom . Altogether , Vanderbilt , the journalist , did very well . With the aid of his tourist ticket he cut his expenses for the trip , including presents and passages , to two thousand dollars ; and he has already contracted to sell something like ten thousand worth of articles , written on steamer and train , to newspaper syndicates . ' WAS NOT Mr. Vanderbilt , Jr. , who told us that he had been contradicted in the statement that London was the foggiest place in the world . Whoever it was said that his critic had added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where was that ? " was the dubious inquiry . " I do n't know , " answered the clever fellow , " it was so foggy . " Subtleties of Coney OR the special information of V those who have come into town to see the dentist , this year 's innovations at Coney Island as discovered by us are herewith set down . In a blaze of fireworks we arrived on the Boardwalk at nine o'clock on a Tuesday night , our fortuitous entry coinciding with Coney 's new weekly pyrotechnic display . Resisting a spieler 's alluring promise of a wax Gerald Chapman being hanged , we entered Bob 's Coaster , which differs from the ordinary roller coaster in that one loses one 's hat while running on a velodrome bank instead of straight up and down . The Heyday Ride , too , is new , combining the subtle delights of the Caterpillar with those of the Whip . More restful is " The World a Million Years Ago , " side-show edition of Conan Doyle 's " Lost World " and replete with prehistoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with ten for the dainty dinosaur . ALL of which having been duly observed , we returned , by force of habit , to Luria and Steeplechase parks , without which no trip to Coney is complete . Luna this year keeps its al fresco pool open until midnight , has free dancing , an excellent rodeo and two baby elephants . The Steeplechase , too , boasts new horrors , as elderly ladies in angry abandon stumble into spiral chutes which dump them onto revolving discs , are inveigled onto a Roulette Wheel which throws them into a pit whose only exit is a doghouse , or suddenly find themselves in a hectic spot known as Innocence Theatre , where the most disconcerting accidents befall them in public . Here , say the gossips , may often he found on summer nights a certain laughing onlooker from Seagate . For the information of those whose penchant is celebrities , the name of the visitor is Al Smith . Incident FORGETTING all about Mrs. Cheyney 's scruples , Ina Claire was driving her roadster through the pleasant gloaming of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big husky on a bicycle . He was pedaling along , in and out of the motors , boldly defying Rolls and Fords , and deeply he resented the ubiquity of Ina Claire 's own car . As he could n't quite shove her into the gutter he turned his head and yelled at her . Smilingly , suavely , Miss Claire leaned down from her seat ; and gently she reprimanded him : " Your bark is worse than your bike . " Grand Central THE aortic Grand Central Station at this season has all it can do to live up to its reputation as the only station in New York that works . The Pennsylvania is beautiful , but it does n't work very well . But you only have to stand for a few moments on the Lower Level and watch the thousands passing quietly through to realize that the reputation of the Grand Central for both dignity and efficiency is safe . So quietly does it work that it takes careful watching to discover the movement of individuals . The hosts of lost and hopeless people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of a great stream . A surprisingly cheerful stream it is , considering the weather . There is a rhythm to it . There is a small crowd waiting near the entrance gate over which is displayed a list of destinations , a crowd through which presently shoulders an impassive gateman . He is the man of the hour . With the deliberation that must mark St. Peter 's movements at the Gate of Heaven lie lets down the chain and a/Iows the crowd of anxious souls to push in . Then begins a little drama in this particular corner of the vast building . It is a drama of ever increasing tempo . From time to time , now that the way is open , men and women by twos and threes detach themselves from the greater stream and pass the gate which Destiny has picked for them . They come leisurely at first , with no thought of the time ; they look trustingly at the gateman and pass through serenely . But as the zero hour approaches , their step acquires an increasing swiftness . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to be on the safe side . And then suddenly the aspect of things changes , and the gateman 's face hardens . He is St. Peter , and the souls who thus come running are less sinless than those who have already passed into eternal joy . And the souls regard him with suspicion now , as if accusing him of dark thoughts ; the right is on their side , there is still a minute to spare . Although stern and impassive , St. Peter feels the spirit of the approaching crisis . He looks at his watch and then utters a cry of warning , an incomprehensible ululation to mankind , and turns to do his fatal duty . Immediately , as it were out of the floor , spring up four or five individuals in frantic haste , besieging him with prayers , and pass through the half-closed door , sighing with relief , their skirts singed with damnation . The door closes . From far off comes running a man with a bundle , intent , desperate . But the gateman has disappeared , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woeful and alone , he looks at his watch and wanders off , to appear from time to time during the next half-hour listlessly  --  eventually to vanish , received , no doubt , through some other gate by the all-comprehending , all-merciful Saint Peter . THE actors in this drama arc legion : children under the guidance of the self-sacrificing going to the country , golfers , chess players , plumbers , violin makers , bankers , and thieves ; the conventional , paying the penalty of their respectability by wearing underclothes ; the individualist , wearing only what they have to , to escape arrest ; the hot , fat , and tired ; the roguish and the religious ; the beautiful and the damned . The pessimists maintain that this throng is tragic to those who understand it . But look at it closely and you will find that most of the figures are strong . The sorrows and diseases which they carry with them in secret would , no doubt , appeal , but they have all won the right to show a brave front . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who go into the Grand Central have all gone there purposefully  --  they have gone to catch a train , and their eyes show a determination to do it or bust . ? IT W ' AS David H. Wallace who , upon being interviewed concerning the French debt disturbance , replied that he thought France should show a little more patience with our natural seeking for money  --  Senate seats costing what they do nowadays . Broadway Vistas HOWEVER unillumined the summer theatre may be , the whiteness of the White Way remains impeccable even on a humid showery evening , and several new creations in electrical signs have appeared to enliven the scene . Outstanding are the clear lamps of the Maytag Aluminum Washing Machine display , which from seven P.M. to one A.M. , with meticulous precision and cheerful speed , washes and hangs upon a line to dry , a collection of waving garments . Our own preference is for the signs that are restrained in color , although there is a certain magnificence in the Chevrolet 's orange and blue sunburst above Forty-seventh Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marc Nostrum , " of course , is the most vivid of the theatre signs and the rhythmic changing of the letters from red to green above the mermaid in her twinkling waves casts a spell if one lingers long enough . Fond memories of the Wrigley acrobatic lads cause a search for contemporary electrical tricks to equal them , only to find a mild and not wholly satisfied amusement in the sign that proclaims the merits of a certain brand of salted peanuts , where a manikin to emphasize his point kicks his hat on and off with an accuracy that must annoy the vaudeville performers loafing in the off season around the corner of the Palace . The dome of the Capitol and the " last drop " in the Maxwell coffee cup still top the scene , and on a wet night Broadway is at its best with its sheeny pavement reflections and its dimming of a garish detail . ? IF WE ARE discouraged with sum- " - mer theatres and were , a week or two ago , fairly pessimistic in our prophesies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? our latest advices on the theatre forecast . Outstanding events should be Patrick Kearney 's dramatization of Dreiser 's " American Tragedy , " and " Deep River , " the Frank Harling jazz opera which Arthur Hopkins will produce . There is also considerable interest in the serious intention announced by the combined Actors ' Theatre and O'Neill-MacGowan-Jones group to institute an O'Neill repertoire company in New York . All that is needed is to find a commercial manager willing to gamble with the idea , but already there is a definite plan to revive " Beyond the Horizon " with , the company now playing " The Great God Brown . " ANEW Michael Arlen play , " The Cavalier of the Streets , " is promised for the late season by Mr. A. H. Woods and it develops that Helen Menken and Basil Rathbone will play the leads in the startling " La Prisonniere , " while Jane Cowl will use another Parisian success , " La Riposte . " Beatrice Lillie is to have her own musical comedy under the Ming-ham direction , ' Walter Hampden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and it is probable  --  enthralling thought  --  that Ethel Barrynnore will play " The Private Life of Helen of Troy , " to be produced by Winthrop Ames . This last gentleman continues to take votes on the preferred Gilbert and Sullivan operettas , but all signs still point to " The Pirates of Penzance " as his next offering . Almost as cheering is the news of a gala revival of " Robin Hood " by Milton Aborn at the Century . More M of another Arlen V I play would indicate another Arlen story , and this one comes from the Continent . A titled American lady , knowing nothing of the author , met casually one of his brothers who continues to bear the family name of Kouynurndjian , and found him a very pleasing person . A few weeks later , at another resort , she came upon a man she thought was the Armenian . She greeted him as an old friend , but the man stared blankly . Confident she was not mistaken , the lady inquired , " But are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a celebrity whose acquaintance is being sought , smiled sweetly and bowed low . " No , I am not Mr. Kouyoumdjian . I am his brother Michael Arlen . " " A remarkable resemblance , " was all the lade said as she walked on , leaving Mr. Arlen to meditate . True XTOT the least loss to the com- community in the recent conviction of one of the czars of the liquor trade , is that the city will be minus one more man with a fit sense of humor . It is related of him that , even while the attorneys were battling over him in court , one of his shipments of three hundred cases of Scotch was being safely landed in a harbor on the east coast of Long Island . Lacking definite instructions , and missing the firm hand of their ruler ; the two lieutenants in charge of the landing decided to consult the czar himself , there pleading a matter of life and death ; hurrying by motor to the Federal Building , they were allowed to speak with the accused in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innocence of his client . The king of bootleggers listened to his henchmen , gave instructions that settled the dispute , and finally concluded : " Now you two get back to the trucks and do n't bother me again . I got other worries . These guys are trying to frame up a case and railroad me to jail . "
