PRESIDENT <P> President Harding took an important step when he settled a little dispute which had grown up among the members of the Tariff Commission . Great political as well as economic results may follow the President 's decision . <P> The Question . The Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act contained for the first time in national history a provision for a flexible or elastic tariff to be applied entirely at the discretion of the Chief Executive . On recommendation of the Tariff Commission he may raise or lower duties ( not more than 50% of the amount fixed by law ) . The question which arose in the Tariff Commission was whether it had the power to investigate and recommend changes in the tariff on its own initiative , or whether it must confine its consideration to specific tariff rates against which complaints were made . The Republican members of the Commission , with the exception of Vice Chairman William S. Culbertson , were in favor of the latter narrower interpretation of the act . The Democrats , who are eager for a revision of the Fordney-McCumber Tariff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was agreed that Mr. Harding should decide . <P> The Decision . After a two-hour conference at the White House a decision was given out . It was nominally a compromise , but actually a triumph for the liberal interpretation of the law . In cases where complaints are made the commission may " limit the inquiry or broaden it to include related subjects . " Where no complaints are filed , after preliminary inquiry and conference with the President , such formal investigations may be authorized " as the facts may warrant and public interest require . " <P> The Significance . Mr. Harding 's interpretation of the law is important because it gives the Chief Executive wider power over the tariff than was intended when the law was drawn . Only half an hour before President Harding met the Tariff Commission , Senator Smoot , who was responsible for the elastic provision of the Tariff Act , called at the White House and told the President that Congress had no intention of giving the Tariff Commission general permission to rewrite the tariff . <P> To be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is extremely problematic ) the President alone can make actual changes in rates , and might disregard the Commission 's recommendations . But the fact remains that he has greatly enlarged his powers , however he may choose to exercise them . He may make changes to remedy only the obvious defects of the law as they develop in practice . His friends say this is his intention . But he , or some later President , out of sympathy with the law , might choose to take the making of the tariff entirely into the hands of the Executive .
