Said he : <P> " The greatest efforts , however , must be made in order to reach this goal . Besides the question of a higher level of the budget , the question of the balancing of the actual revenues and expenditures must be investigated because the Government now admits that the preliminary budget shows an increase of the deficit , which can only become worse so long as the present crisis continues . Therefore , reforms and economies must still form an important role in Austrian state economy .

He warned the Austrians to that effect . The granting of short term loans from abroad was a healthy sign , said he .
