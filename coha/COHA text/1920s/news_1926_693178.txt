txt Extols Her " Amazing Courage " In Wartime Relief Work and Her - " Magnetic Personality , " Lady Astor , vivacious and full of thoughts on all sorts of subjects , sailed for England yesterday on the Aquitania . Before she left she was persuaded to say something about Dean Inge 's gloomy prognostications as to England 's future . She decried the Dean 's form of pessimism as that of a gloomy man who believed in a gloomy God . And of Queen Marie of Rumania , who is soon to land here , she said she had the most remarkable war record of any woman in the world and was one of the least appreciated women outside her own country . Lady Astor turned around with a little grimace of amused despair when hporters filed into her stateroom . " I have n't a single thing to say , not a thing , " she declared firmly . " Why am I still supposed to be good copy ? " It was suggested that perhaps the reason was because she always had something interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But in answer to a question as to whether she thought the French playwright , Jacques Deval , was right in reporting that Americans never smiled , Lady Astor said she did n't think he knew much about this country . " However , what Frenchman does understand Americans ? " she asked . " As few probably as those Americans who understand Frenchmen . It is very difficult for the people of any country to understand those of another . " Decries Dean 's Gloomy Ideas . That suggested Dean Inge , who , in his recent book , " England , " said that Great Britain 's days as a great world power were numbered . " I do n't pay very much attention to the Dean or his books , " she said . " He is a gloomy - clan and his God is a gloomy God . His religion is gloomy . He sees the world rushing to its doom . He says our youth is listless . How could it well be otherwise , coming from the shadow of war . " I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , said : ' How strange it is to know that lire are going to live . ' They all , that young generation , expected to die  --  all their friends were killed . There was never a time that our home was not filled with wounded . Naturally it disturbed them deeply , fundamentally . They had nothing to look forward to but wounds and death . But my younger son , who is 16 now , is full of vitality . of pep . His generation will carry on again in the old way . " There I go using slang again , but really I do n't use it . I just naturally have fallen heir to a few slang words learned during the war . " But as for Dean Inge , I do n't think very many people take what he has said seriously , and I think myself that his ideas of politics and religion also are wrong . Religion is n't gloomy ; It is happy  --  something to cheer us and make us more content . And to those who say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirituality is necessary to every one who lives  --  to you and me and all people . We can not live without something of it in our souls . So let us not have gloomy religion and decry a lack of spirituality . When I am told that New York is without religion I know it is not true , for I can see in the faces of young men that there is something more than materialism in them . If New York is not gifted with an altogether spiritual viewpoint , it is certainly groping for it . Denies Drinking Increased . " I do think , however , that such i books as Dean Inge 's have a bad effect , for they cause misunderstanding in a day when understanding is so badly needed . And like the man who said Americans never smile , it is a bad thing for the world to stir up antagonisms . I feel just as angry when I hear Americans criticizing their own country when abroad , talking about prohibition and how much drinking there is . There ca n't be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how difficult " it is now to get a drink . It is impossible that there should be as much drinking now as before . People who come abroad and say so do n't know what they are talking about . It may be true of some parts of the country , but not of the country as a whole . " And then Lady Astor stopped while a steward brought in a big box filled , she explained , with quilts from Virginia . She would n't lose them for the world , she said . " Oh , there is something I want to Say , " she exclaimed eagerly when she turned around . " I want to tell you about Queen Marie . You have all read a good deal about her , I suppose , but there is one side of her character which you have not heard about . She has never written about it herself . She has the most remarkable war record of any woman in the world , I believe . She is a woman of great courage and during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influenza epidemic was at its height she went where many men hesitated to go , where the dead were piled up two and three deep . She has amazing courage . " I did not quite understand her when I first knew her , for she is a thorough aristocrat , a daughter of the Czars , and I am a democrat . Our ideals are somewhat different . But as I came to know her better I learned to admire her tremendously . She possesses the most magnetic personality ; she has wonderful charm . She glows like a warm light when she comes into the room . You will be captivated by her . Every one about her loves her . She is a most devastating woman . There le nothing little about her . I never heaed her say a , mean or spiteful thing about any one . " With Lady Astor sailed her cousin , Mrs. L. L. Albert Abbot of Lynchburg , Va. , and Elizabeth Brown of New York . Robert Brand . Charles Dana Gibson , her brother-in-law , and Dr. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
