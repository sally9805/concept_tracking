The following editorial appeared , last week , in the Pittsburgh Courier , most famed Negro newspaper in the U. S. : <P> WE GET IN EVERYWHERE <P> " Whatever goes on in the world there always seems to be a Negro there . When Columbus discovered America a Negro piloted one of his ships . Almost every early history of the western hemisphere tells of some part taken by Negroes . As early as 1645 there were free Negroes in New York , and it is common knowledge that the first Negroes in Virginia arrived in 1619 , but a few years after the white colonists at Jamestown . In the French and Indian Wars , black men did their bit , and a Negro was first to fall in the War for Independence . They were with Perry at the battle of Lake Erie and they helped Jackson repulse the British at the Battle of New Orleans . The first chief of police of St. Petersburg ( now Petrograd ) under the Bolshevist regime was a Negro , and it was a black man , Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus enabling that gentleman to discover it . <P> " When the flagship of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition , the City of New York , left Manhattan on August 26 , it looked as if this would be one trip on which there would be no Negro .

He is evidently one of those youths filled with the spirit of adventure , since he had hiked across the continent some time before . At any rate , he concealed himself aboard the City of New York , and was not discovered until the bark was well out to sea . He had stayed in his hiding place for several days without food and had withstood the danger of asphyxiation during the fumigation of the ship prior to its departure . Certainly here was a young man eager to embark on this great and dangerous expedition to the southern ice continent . Happily for him , Commander Byrd was so impressed by his courage and excellent stamina that he has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys who stowed away were put off ere the ship got out of the harbor because sailors heard them arguing . The black boy goes . The promoters of the first trip to the moon had better examine their rocket carefully if they would make sure that no adventurous Negro is aboard . "
