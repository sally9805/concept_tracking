Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovitch , brother of Grand Duke Kyrill , self-styled " Tsar of All the Russias " and cousin of the late Tsar , boarded at Cherbourg the liner Olympic which forthwith churned her way through many miles of water United States ward . <P> Shortly afterwards , " the smiling , swarthy , confident little Socialist from New York , " Congressman Fiorello H. La Guardia , wrote a letter to U. S. Secretary of Labor Davis . He asserted that " this Grand Duke Boris " was coming to the U. S. He wanted Secretary Davis to make sure that the Grand Duke was not likely to become a public charge . Said he ; " I believe the department would be justified in ascertaining whether these repudiated , unemployed and shiftless dukes and archdukes are not coming here with the intention of overthrowing our republican form of government in the hope of establishing a monarchy . According to newspaper reports , people clamored and paid admission for the purpose of curtseying and kissing the hand of these pretenders ( reference to the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 15 ) in a manner so un-American that it would have been shocking were it not so ridiculously stupid . " <P> Such a bald attack upon the princely member of a kingly house was quickly answered . Edward S. Rothchild , President of the Chelsea Exchange Bank , Manhattan , said that Congressman La Guardia 's letter was " outrageous . " Another characterized the reference to overthrowing the U. S. Government as the " bombastic utterances of a political nonentity . " Others made haste to state that the Grand Duke was not a pauper : he was coming with 22 trunks ; the Duchess was bringing 100 Parisian gowns ; ( he was bringing his mother-in-law and a secretary ; he had two large bank accounts in Manhattan . <P> Hardly had this hubbub died down than the Grand Duke arrived , landed . With him were the Grand Duchess , whom Boris married in Paris six years ago ; Mme. Rachevsky , mother-in-law ; Princess Natalie , niece ; Baron Nicholas Crown , secretary . The Grand Duke-a man just over medium height , 47 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which grows a fringe of dark hair turning grey and into which is set a pair of jovial , navy-blue eyes-was highly delighted to be in the U. S. Even the assaults of the everlasting newspaper squad could not extinguish the fire of his joy . <P> The following questions , put to Boris by unsatiable and inexhaustible journalists , were satisfactorily answered . <P> Q.- ' ' What did you come to the U. S. for ? " <P> A.- " I am here for pleasure only , 1 wish my wife to see America . This is my first visit to this country since 1902 , and 1 look forward to enjoying it very much . " <P> Q.- " Do you think a Tsarist restoration possible ? " <P> A.- " Yes , I do , because the majority of the Russian people understand that form of government better than any other . I do not know when it will be , but there are signs of the Soviet regime breaking up now through the internal Struggle among the Communists . " <P> Q.- " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsar ? " <P> A.- " He is only a second cousin of the late Tsar. * He is the Commander-in-Chief of the Army , but not the heir to the throne . "
