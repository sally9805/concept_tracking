SCIENCE <P> " Come again , go again , talk again , Mars . " <P> The " opposition " of the Earth and Mars , as their nearest approach to each other is termed in astronomical language , took place last week with a maximum excitement on the part of the public and a minimum excitement on the part of astronomers . These oppositions occur about every 26 months , but every 15 or 16 years there is an opposition when the two bodies ate nearer each other than usual , and about every hundred years or so there is an opposition at which the two planets are extremely near together-about 34,600,000 miles . This occasion belonged to the last group . <P> The idea that there might be life-human life , animal life-on Mars , based on the existence of geometrical lines on the surface of the planet , led naturally to attempts to receive communications . Several radio stations , at the instance of Professor David Todd , of Amherst , were tempted to listen . Positive results were of course few . In Vancouver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or zipps every day at certain hours ; these , however , were explained as signals from " radio beacons " set up by the U. S. to assist vessels at sea . <P> In Newark and in London , strange sounds were heard ; they probably came either from amateur stations or from static or peculiarities in the apparatus . <P> At sea , the steamship France encountered an electric storm which upset radio communication , and the gullible press suggested " Mars ! " <P> On the top of the Jungfrau , a Swiss scientist claimed to have seen flashes of yellow and green light from the planet , which might have been flashes of sunlight on mountain peaks . <P> In the main the results were decidedly negative . Some study of the planet was made from certain observatories . The Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff , Ariz. , which " specializes in Mars , " made observations in an effort to advance the tenets of the late Professor Percival Lowell that there is life on the planet , as evidenced by the existence of vegetation colors and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in studying the satellites or moons , Phobos and Deimos ( Fear and Dread ) , named after the mythological steeds of Mars ' chariot . No new satellite was discovered , although at the Yerkes Observatory at Lake Geneva , Wis. , conditions were very favorable for examining the satellites . <P> There is considerable dispute as to the exact conditions which pertain on Mars ' surface , so that there is ample room for difference of opinion as to the possibility of life . Conditions are certainly different from those on the Earth , but it is just as impossible to say that there is no life as to say that there is . The evidence is circumstantial to a refined degree . But if there is life on Mars , it is in different form from that existing on the Earth . Some scientists are inclined to grant the existence of vegetable life , such as fungi , and to deny animal existence . <P> Sir Oliver Lodge 's remarks fairly summarize the opinions of many scientists :           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
