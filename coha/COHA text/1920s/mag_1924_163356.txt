Bismarck R. Pinchback , namesake of Otto Edward Leopold , Empire-forger , died last week . He had the distinction of being the son of the only Negro who ever acted as Governor of Louisiana . His father , Pinckney Benton Stewart , as President of the State Senate and Lieutenant Governor , ruled Louisiana for two months ( December 1872 through January 1873 ) during the impeachment trial of Governor Henry Clay Warmoth . It was at the time of the carpet-bagger-scalawag rgime , when President Grant was maintaining a Republican state government in power by force of arms . Histories call Pinchback a good man or a scoundrel , depending on which side of the Mason-Dixon line they were written . Two years ago the elder Pinchback died and was buried in Metairie Cemetery-the only colored man in the precincts . Southern whites protested , but the former Governor had bought his burial plot 20 years earlier . It was not reported whether Bismarck will be buried with his father .                @ @ @ @ @
