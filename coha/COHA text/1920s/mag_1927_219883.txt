Three hundred years ago in crowded London slums , hungry bellies ached , loaves of black bread were stolen . Next morning the gallows tree bore fresh fruit of petty thieves ; punishment was quick , certain , cruel . Crime did not abate . <P> Now in legislatures throughout the U. S. in prosperous states of a prosperous nation , men have sought for months new ways to defeat crime , have argued the old question : Will crime decrease as punishment becomes more sure , more certain ? <P> Last fortnight in the New York State Legislature , the Baumes Crime Commission sought to sharpen the teeth of existing Baumes laws with 84 new recommendations , to make parole and bail harder , conviction easier , take deadly weapons from the hands of criminals .

The Indiana Senate passed a law banning machine guns ; Kansas Senators passed a bill reviving capital punishment . <P> In New York , jewelers indorsed last year 's Baumes laws providing life imprisonment for criminals four times convicted of a felony , said the laws have reduced their losses from theft 50% . <P> In newspaper headlines throughout the country , the name Baumes had been rising to new prominence . Who , what it is-trade mark , symbol , place-many people can only guess . But in the New York Senate they know what lies behind the name : it is a man . State Senator Caleb H. Baumes , short , sparse , with drooped moustache and thin white hair , sponsored the Baumes laws , sputtered and spumed " mawkish sentiment " at critics who called them cruel , lived to see his name rise to a disembodied symbol of " punishment to fit the crime .
