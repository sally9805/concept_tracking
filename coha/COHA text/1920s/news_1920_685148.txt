txt Fo ? a body of men who are already arraigned at the bar of public opinion and whose business future is affected by , a flood of drastic bills immediately to : be introduced at Albany , some of the United ' Real Estate Owners , in their conference of last Sunday , were amazingly indiscreet . Their President , STFWAnT BROWNS , proposed that they stand united for the right to exact from their tenants profits to the ' extent of " 20 per cent . net income , on the assessed value of the property . " Twenty per cent . is four or five times what the better class of real ' estate returned before the war , when net incomes sometimes ranged below 4 per cent . The present shortage.of housing has eliminated virtually every element of risk . A bond could hardly be more secure . Yet Mr. Bnowxn 's proposal was greeted with " a roar of disapproval " that Was followed by a ** of individual protests . " Warm , - ant all the money we can get ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do some howling about the milk trust ? ' " said another . Much has been said , with sufficient truth and justice , of the profiteering c ' organized labor . It is . one of several factors that render the whole future of th ' world uncertain . Yet the general increase of wages bears some relation to the advance of the cost of living ; while in many instances , instances worthy of celebration , labor leaders have disapproved strike projects , realizing that they were inimical to public policy and calculated in aI large measure to defeat their own ends . No leader of a strike ever gave voice to a more ruthless greed than some of these nieneof property . Not even the certainty that the accents of their " roaring " will reverberate at Albany could hold their rapacity in leash . The exhibition is the more deplorable because the problem in hand is one of peculiar delicacy and difficulty . The sufferings of a great city , of thousands , of women and children , press for instant relief ; yet every expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tried in many cities of Europe , with no encouraging success . There is little prospect that they would be more successful in the . hands of our own municipal authorities . Several of the bills to be introduced raise difficult questions of constitutionality . Above all is the danger that ' the shameless exhibition of last Sunday will subject the landlords ' profits to an unwise restriction . Building operations must be largely conducted on money raised by mortgage ; yet the taxes upon income are causing mortgagors to divert funds now loaned on real estate to other fields . The problem of financing the 100,000 new dwellings which the city requires can not be solved unless liberal terms are ' granted to in , estors . And unless this basic financial problem is ' solved there is no prospect , of stabilizing the prices of building . material , which daily are becoming higher and more erratic . There are , in brief , many reasons why . the . profits permitted ? landlords , . present and . future . should. , be liberal . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational ' statement . of their cause the United Real Estate Owners gave voice to the - hitherto silent greed of the profiteer. ' ? ;
