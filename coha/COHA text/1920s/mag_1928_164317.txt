KIT CARSON , THE HAPPY WARRIOR OF THE OLD WEST #151 ; Stanley Vestal-Hough-ton Mifflin ( $3.50 ) . Before Horace Greeley had thought of his famed suggestion , Kit Carson had made the West his own country . At 15 , he was apprenticed to a saddler . He ran away after a few months to become a " mountain man . " Soon he was counted among the best . He knew the habits of game animals , was well versed in customs and mental processes of the Indian . He had a reputation for absolute truthfulness and reliability , and was a crack shot . He never learned to read or write ( except his name ) , but he knew Mexican Spanish , Canadian French , and a half dozen Indian tongues . He was the first white man to become a cowboy , the greatest Indian fighter the country ever had . Before he was 50 , he had scores of scalps to his credit and many an Indian believed he had a charmed life . <P> Kit had three wives in eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Indian custom . The third was a beautiful Spanish girl , Josefa . They were married by a Catholic priest . <P> It was hard for John Charles Fremont , adventurer ( TIME , March 12 ) , to realize that Kit was a devil incarnate in an Indian fight . Fremont , generous , press-agented the unassuming Kit , who helped him capture territory from the Mexicans and make California a part of the U. S. As a lieutenant , Kit took part in Fremont 's quarrel with General Kearney in the California conquest . The U. S. Government was unwilling to confirm Kit 's commission ; and thus his two years ' service to his country under Fremont went unpaid and unrecognized . Kit regarded the Army as an unmixed curse to the country . Kit was never intrigued by the California gold rush . He was too busy fighting Indians . <P> After the Civil War he was appointed Indian Agent . But by that time he had lost his health ; was broke and lonely . He died before he was 60 . <P> Author Vestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vestal tiresome for too much apologizing . Kit had courage , needs no excuses . Author Vestal also has an irritating habit of breaking into an Indian war cry , " Wagh ! "
