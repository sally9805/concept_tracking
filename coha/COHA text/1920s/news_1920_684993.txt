txt The new session of the House of Commons was launched today with speeches by Premier Lloyd George . William Adamson , and Sir Donald , who spoke for the Government , Laborites , and Liberals , respectively . No notable Irish voice was heard , although Ireland was the subject of part of all the speeches . The Premier gave a ' Ong explanation of the Government 's Russian policy , but refused to be drawn by the other speak , ers on the topic of revising certain " unworkable " features Of the Peace Treaty . Mr. Lloyd George said he agreed with 1 the view that Europe could not be restored without putting Russia , with all her strength and resources , " into circulation . " Bolshevism was possibly efficient , said the Premier , but it was not democracy , and Russia must be restored under an anti-Bolshevist regime . " Bolshevism can not be crushed by force of areas , " continued the Premier . " I held that opinion a. year ago , but my advice , tendered on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to give the anti-Bolshevists da chance to recover Russia , but they failed . The failure was not due to lack of equipment but to more fundamental causes . " The Premier - contends that the suggested " ring of fire " to crush the Bolshevikt was impossible because it was doubtful whether Finland would eoriii  --  rit , and the Baltic States , he pointed out , were making peace with Russia , while Rumania was really engaged in watching the Hungarian front and the Japanese were discinelined toward the idea . Moreover , he added , neither France , the United ' States , Italy , nor Great Britain was willing to provide the funds . Must Drop " Methods of Barbarism . " " Until , " added the Premier , " they are assured that the Bolsheviks have dropped the methods of barbarism in favor of civilized government , no civilized community in the world is prepared to make peace with them . Further , there is no established Government possessing the right to speak for the whole of European Russia . We failed to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save her by trade . " Commerce has a sobering influence . There is nothing to fear from a Bolshevist invasion of surrounding countries or the Middle East , because the Bolshevik ' can not organize a powerful army . I believe that trading will bring to an end the ferocity , rapine and cruelties of Bolshevism more surely than any other method , and Europe badly nceds what Russia is able to supply but can not supply with contending armies Moving across the borders . " The dangers are not all in Russia ; they are here at home . I speak- with knowledge , with apprehension and responsibility , and I warn the House that in the face of things which may happen we must use every legitimate weapon . We must fight anarchy with abundance . " Replying to general criticism of the Government 's policy by William Adamson , leader of the Labor Party ; Sir Donald , and others who demanded especially the reviaion of the Versailles Peace Treaty , Premier Lloyd George declared that it would be impossible in a single . speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that he would remark that . after the excitement of the great war nobody could expect anything but a period Of reaction and discontent , and even a certain measure of disaffection . ' ? Answers Criticism on Ireland . Alluding to Ireland the Premier asked whether Mr. Adamson meant by " selfdetermination " that if the majority of the ' Irish people demanded a republic he would give it . Unless Mr. Adamson meant that . said the Premier , his talk of self-determination was dishonest . There were murders and assassinations " of the most cowardly and despicable kind in Ireland , " the Premier told his . questioner , and he asked whether the member thought the Government should withdraw all its troops " and leave the assassins in charge in Ireland . " Declaring that the duty of the , , Government was- to maintain law and - order in Ireland ; the Premier turned to ' the high cost of , which he said was attributable to the depreciation of money and not to profiteering . The only remedy was to increase production , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' Premier said he was . glad to be able ' to ' say that the coming budget would balance , and more than balance . Colonel Sidney Peel ? Coalition Unionist , *who made the ropy to the address from the Throne , said : It will be a grievous disappointment to us if the United States finds itself unable to take part in the work of reconstruction . But she must he master in her own house . as we are in ours . " Sir Donald , urging revision of the Peace Treaty , said : " One of the essentials cf the guarantee was the fact . wl en the opposition agreed to it , that the signature of the President of the United States was appended . It does not now look as though this is going to be honored . " I only hope I am wrong . " he added , as Mr. ? Lloyd George indicated his dissent . The American Ambassador , John W. Davis . and  --  the Canadian Premier , Sir Robert L. Borden , were among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thanks in the House of Lords for the King 's speech , expressed approval of the recent letter of Viscount Grey , British Ambassador at Washington , with regard to the American position on the Peace Treaty . He said : " We must allow the Ameritan people to choose their own path . I am convinced , - despite - recent misleading appearances . that we may confidently ant icipate increasing participation by the United States in the world 's affairs . " Curzon Thankful for Grey Letter . Earl Curzon , Secretary for Foreign Affairs , concurred with Baron Charnwood , and said that although Viscount Grey had acquainted him with his intention to publish the letter , it was neither inspired by nor submitted to the Government . " I consider that the letter did not savor of interference in the domestic affairs of America , and I feel no sentiment but thanks to Lord Grey , " he declared . Earl Curzon thought that the Marquis of Crewe was right when he said that a good deal of the Peace Treaty might have to be rewritten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sacrosanct . " If Germany shows a disposition faithfully to carry out her obligations , " he added , " we will do our best to aid her in fulfilling them and resuming her place among civilized communities . " Alluding to the delay in the peace settlement-with Turkey ; he referred to European anxiety that the United States share in the settlement of these regions . " This anxiety . " said the secretary , " is quite unselfish and sincere . I believe that every one of the great powers would have abandoned the greater part . of its individual ambition if it could be persuaded that America . would come in and bear her share of the burden as mandatory for the whole Turkish Empire . I wo n't say a word in criticism , still less in derogation , of America 's attitude . We may feel disappointed , but America has a traditional policy which we ought to endeavor to understand and respe.ct . She desires to keep free from entanglements and she is the best judge of her own policy . But her refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mandate is confided to England . I think it is too late to talk of limiting our activities in Mesopotamia to the Vilayet of Basra and bear no share in the future control of Bagdad . I am convinced that any attempt to retire thence would be received with absolute dismay in the country itself . "
