White Shadows of the South Seas . <P> Equipped with Frederick O'Brien 's book bearing this name , a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer squad sailed for Tahiti in the South Sea Islands to make a picture . In the squad were that frazzled lover , Monte Blue , and a 20-year-old Mexican girl named Raquel Torres . At Tahiti , the squad got natives to fill out the cast , paid them with canned salmon , flour , toilet water , shaving cream , mirrors . Everybody might have enjoyed a good time , had it not been for the rain and the heat , which combined to produce a disease called rain-tan . Even when it did not rain , there was so much moisture in the air that clothes became soaking wet in ten minutes . More pleasant were the native feasts which lasted from 11 a. m. to 3 p. m . A sample menu : crabs , lobsters , centipedes , octopus , green turtle , bonito , albacore , roast pig , chicken , duck , breadfruit , bananas , mummy apples , yams , coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is prettily produced , but fails to surprise . It is the old tale of white men 's hellish conduct among South Sea natives . Dr. Lloyd ( Monte Blue ) , a good man gone to drink , is set adrift on a pest ship by his enemy , Pearl Trader Sebastian . The sea casts him upon an island , whose inhabitants have never before seen a white man . Dr. Lloyd behaves ; the natives make a man of him . A chaste love springs up between him and Fayaway ( Raquel Torres ) , village virgin , daughter of the chief . After they are married , Dr. Lloyd becomes greedy for native pearls . He lights a beacon , hoping to attract a passing ship to help him loot the village . Then he repents , but dastardly Pearl Trader Sebastian has seen the beacon . Sebastian and his crew ravage the island , leaving behind them the white men 's shadows-lust , liquor , disease , greed . Dr. Lloyd is killed while trying to defend his race-in-law . <P> There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the tattooing of a native in that honest old film , Moana of the South Sea Islands . <P> At Yale . " Now , you must do something big for Yale , " says the daughter of a professor to an undergraduate who had come all the way from Argentine . And what does the Argentine ? He tucks the pigskin under his dislocated shoulder and runs 90 yards for the winning touchdown in the last quarter . It is the worst rah-rah film on record . Rod La Roque as the Argentine is obnoxious . Jeanette Loff as the professor 's daughter is a pretty discovery . <P> <P> Loves of an Actress is a tragedy , with Pola Negri reclining on a soft couch most of the time . She loves them all-bankers , counts , newspaper owners-but , deep down , she is disgusted with men . Then along comes a lean-hipped young diplomat ( Nils Asther ) and the Lady of the Couch is stricken with love-at-first-sight . " What does it matter ? " she cries , " A man-a woman-before them the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rejected count threatens to reveal her past and ruin the young diplomat 's career .
