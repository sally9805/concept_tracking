She Launched a Thousand Scandals <P> The Story . The early life of Helen of Troy may not have been private-or at any rate Professor Erskine chooses to summarize it in two sentences : " So they all intended well . But Paris saw Helen face to face . " The story begins when the topless towers of Ilium were falling : Menelaus sword in hand storms into Helen 's room to kill her , looks and exclaims : " Helen , it 's time we went home . " <P> So they got Helen with her strange fascinating beauty , accustomed to what she wants , and baffled by her inability to come at what she most wants-life . At Sparta , the servants are taken aback when Menelaus restores her to her old place in his home , and Menelaus has to remind them that he has changed : " And we 've been through the war , you should remember . Nothing can be quite the same again . " <P> Their daughter Hermione has been trying to save her mother 's reputation by spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furniture ) against her will , but that she never went to Troy-she had been staying with a lady and gentleman in Egypt . Helen will have nothing of such an alibi . She tells her neighbors that she is not repentant of " the bitter bridal bed where the fair mischief lay by Paris ' side . " It was inevitable . In fact Menelaus was to blame . Helen says : " I think a decent man could lose his wife without bringing on a war . " <P> Hermione is shocked . Hermione wants to marry her cousin Orestes . Helen does not like the straight-laced young fellow and would prefer her to marry Pyrrhus , the daredevil son of Achilles . Then there is the rumor that Eteoneus , the gatekeeper , brings to Menelaus : " Your sister-in-law Clytemnestra-your double sister-in-law , I might say ; your wife 's sister and your brother 's wife-has been living with Aegisthus ever since Agamemnon went to Troy . " <P> " There ! I never liked her , " exclaims Menelaus . " I 'm shocked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be only gossip . " <P> Eteoneus replies : " These rumors that spread about beautiful women are often malicious or envious , as you say , but they 're rarely exaggerated . " <P> Helen nags Menelaus to have Pyrrhus come on a visit but he recalls to her that he had admitted one good looking young man to the house with no good result . Insulted , Helen ejaculates , " I left this house once , and I can do it again . . . . I 'll stay on the one condition , that you insult me no more . Do you wish me to stay ? " <P> He does , and he shortly looks with more favor on Pyrrhus as a possible son-in-law , for Orestes ' father , Agamemnon , comes home and is murdered by Clytemnestra , who is in turn killed by Orestes . Surely it would not do to make an alliance with such a family . But Orestes meets Pyrrhus on the road and kills him after a quarrel , and Hermione elopes with Orestes .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
