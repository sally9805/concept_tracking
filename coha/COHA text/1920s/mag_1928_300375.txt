Leo J. McGinn was carrying the air mail from Cleveland to Chicago . He ran into a snowstorm and a 50 m. p. h. gale near Huron , Ohio , lost control of his plane . It fell on an apple tree , caromed into a barn owned by an undertaker . Pilot McGinn was decapitated as he was thrown from the cockpit . The barn , the plane and the mail bags burned quickly in the cold , whistling night . <P> Later in the week , four men were burned to death when a mail and passenger plane crashed near Chattanooga , Tenn . <P> Ruth McConnell , 20 , of Rochester , N. Y. , took train for San Francisco one day last week . Three days later , David O. Meeker , medical student , also of Rochester , appeared at the Omaha , Neb. , airport and hired a plane to take him to San Francisco . Word got around that Mr. Meeker was chasing Miss McConnell ; the press played up the affair as if it were some sort of Derby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of Mr. Meeker . It developed that Miss McConnell had been in a nervous condition and that Mr. Meeker , a friend of her family , wanted to make sure that nothing happened to her . <P> <P> How many days can a crew of five endure a continuous airplane flight ? How many days can a motor keep the plane going ? The Army wants to know . So do motor and plane makers , passenger and freight carriers . One condition of such tests is that the plane be fueled in the air . An initial experiment took place at Boiling Field , Washington , last week . While a trimotored Fokker army transport flew at 80 m. p. h. , a light refueling plane hovered above her and pumped down gasoline and oil through hoses , dropped food with a rope . The preliminary test worked . So the Fokker and a refueling plane set out for Los Angeles where the break-down tests of men or motors will take place . The name of the Fokker is whimsically Question Mark . <P> <P> Little known is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. d'Annunzio , has been in the U. S. for several years representing the Isotta-Fraschini Motors , Inc . Last week Captain d'Annunzio became a director of the American Aeronautical Corp. , newly organized to manufacture Italian Savoia seaplanes and flying boats in this country . <P> <P> Viola Gentry of Gentry , N. C .. dressed herself snugly at Roosevelt Field , L. I. , last week , and took up a Travel Air plane , equipped with Siemens-Halske motor . She sought and gained something that has no real aeronautical importance-the woman 's endurance record . Her time aloft alone was 8 hrs. 6 min. 37 sec. , better than Lady Sophie Heath 's 77-hr , record made earlier this year . Sixteen years ago , when planes were a novel and dangerous experiment , Ruth Law stayed up six hours . Neither the National Aeronautic Association or the Federation Aeronautique Internationale pays attention to such flights made by women as women . The recognized world endurance record is 65 hours . <P> Richard E. James , 17 , of Flushing , L. I. , a fortnight ago flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because he was the first boy under 21 to make a transcontinental solo flight , the American Society for the Promotion of Aviation gave him a $1,000 prize , Siemens &; Halske Motor Co. ( whose engine drove his plane ) gave him a silver loving cup , and , last week , President Coolidge shook his hand .
