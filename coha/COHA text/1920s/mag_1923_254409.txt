Under their Bishop-elect , Adrot , several thousand Roman Catholic priests have founded in France a new Church . The tradition of celibacy of the clergy is 1,000 years old , but they have decided to break with this tradition . Bishops of similar churches in Holland , Switzerland , Poland , Czecho-Slovakia and Hungary will be present at Adrot 's consecration , which is scheduled for late in April . Two of these had been duly consecrated as bishops before their break with Rome . The new church therefore claims apostolic succession , and the same authoritative basis as the Church of England . <P> Catholic and Lutheran organizations appeared before the United States Supreme Court to contest the Nebraska school law . The law prohibits religious instruction for pupils below the eighth grade in public , private , and parochial schools , except after dark and on Sundays . Both churches protest that the statute is an invasion of their constitutional rights . <P> The Reverend Doctor R. S. MacArthur , 81 , died on February 25 at Daytona Beach , Fla . He was President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvary Baptist Church , New York , for 41 years . He retired in 1911 , and resigned as pastor emeritus of the church in 1922 when his successor , Dr. John Roach Stratton , held a debate with William A. Brady on stage and pulpit morals .
