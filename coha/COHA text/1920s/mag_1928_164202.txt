. . . Went to de rock fo ' ter hide his face But de rock cried out , " No hidin ' place ! No hidin ' place down here ! " <P> - Negro Spiritual . <P> Lacking Congressmen in the South , the Republican Party and especially its chief , the President , is deeply obliged to the Southern members of the Republican National Committee for advice in distributing Federal offices . The officeholders are , in turn , obliged to the National Committeemen for recommending them to the President . <P> All would run smoothly in this Southern Republican scheme of things but for the fact that whites and Negroes mix poorly in the South , even within the Republican Party . And it is only lately that any great number of white Southerners , except for trash , were Republicans . Northern Republicans have even been said to prefer that the Southern wing of their party should stay Negroid because it would then be easier to handle . Lately , however , white Republicans have thought they may yet break the Democrats ' grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have to " play down " the G. O. P. 's Negro connections . They are the " Lily whites . " They are , say the Negro Republicans , almost as bad as the Democrats , who unblushingly stifle the Negro 's vote . <P> A case of " Lily whites " v. Negroes was what lay at the bottom of Mississippi 's <P> Republican scandals last week . Perry W. Howard , Negro national committeeman , was indicted at Biloxi and arrested , with four other men , charged with taking $1,500 between them for compassing the appointment of a deputy U. S. marshal . Mr. Howard was a special attorney for the U. S. Department of Justice . At another time , under other-auspices , he might have hoped that the case would be hushed up or dissipated by indulgent party men in the Department . But Mr. Howard had no luck . Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , Assistant U. S. Attorney General , was following the case herself , in anticipation of the Senate 's investigation of G. 0 . Patronage all through the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Howard was suspended from his Federal niche by Attorney General Sargent . He faced trial with few friends at court . He accused local " Lily-whites " of having " framed " the thing on him . He hurried to Washington to protest his innocence and try to get help . He wanted to know what investigation of G. O. Patronage there would be in States like Texas , Virginia and North Carolina , whose national committeemen are white . <P> Protested Mr. Howard : <P> " I have no fear of the outcome of a fair and impartial trial in Mississippi . No man in the nation has done more than I to prevent anything that even smacked of the purchase and sale of public offices . "
