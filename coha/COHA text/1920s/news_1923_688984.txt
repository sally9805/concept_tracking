txt Prohibition 's Effect on Hotels . To the Editor of The New York Times : When first entering the hotel business I had , a position which involved the compiling of monthly statements showing the profits derived from the sale of wines and liquors , and I therefore feel qualified to write on what prohibition has meant to the first-class hotel . During the months of December , January , February and March , at which time the banquet busine% was at its height , the tota ) l of montiry sales fro-n wines ? and liquors , would , roughly speaking , be somewhat over $70,000 . This , of course , would include all the bars , dining rooms and banquet halls of one of the large hotels I have in mind . The net profit on these sales would sometimes show up as high as 250 per cent. , if I. remembe'r correctly , and in consequence this income , as you can see , was instrumental to a great degree in helping to meet the vast amount of expenditures involved in the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures on the credit side of the ledger . Prohibition completely wipes out this income and with the income tax the result has been that the hotel men have been compelled to raise their room rates and utilize any available frontage for stores and in some cases have been compelled to shut up shop altogether .
