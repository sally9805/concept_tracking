txt America saved its soul in the World War , Premier Boner Law declared today in a speech to 2,250 Conservative women in the Drury Lane Theatre . He hoped , ? he said , that America might yet join the League of Nations and help end the chaos left by the WarIn speaking of Britain 's relations with the United States , the Premier said : " There is nothing to trouble the horiEon there . I think I may venture to express the hope , and I think I can do this ' without indiscretion , that America may gradually take an interest , for example , in the League a Nations in some form or other  --  may gradually feel that it is ber duty to help in the chaos which the War left behind . " I say that without any criticism of America  --  tar from it . " It may be useful at this stage to repeat what was said with no special reasons for saying it , but to repeat it now because what I say may probably be reWrted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said this : " . It is moral force which brought the United States into the war . She had puela to lose in a material sense . She likad little 1111 gain In the great things of W. and very often in the small things , too . The saying of Scripture was true : lie who would have his life shall lose It . the people of the United States had no gala because they would lose money ; but.A.hey would gain something , something far more precious than money , for they had saved the soul of America . ' " Avoids Detailed Declarations . Mr. sonar Law 's address was the ( second Important speech of his campaign and he showed he was fully aware of the gibes and taunts that his negative Glasgow address had provoked , but he refused to be driven from his chpsen attitude . Though he made a few shrewd retorts on his critics he steadfastly abstained from detailed declarations of policy . It was a risky game to play and yet the new Premier mach : an evident impression on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations , and th plain Scotch business man , with his quiet voice and dry humor , got hold of them completely . His straightfori'ardteas made him a popular leader of the /louse of Commons in trying times and his sincerity today gave meaning to Ills least elaborated statements . Mrs. Bridgeman , wife of the new some Secretary , presided , and as she led the Premier to the front of the Stage there was the usual burst of applause , but Mr. Bonar Law refrained alhost studiously from any stage effects land with one formal bow to the audience took his seat and allowed the preliminaries to proceed . When he was called upon he began by clearing away the limitations that the fact that he was addressing women might have seemed to impose . D.eoiares There Is No women 's Question . " I have always believed , " he said , . " that there is no women 's question Which is is worth anything which is not a man 's question . It was for that reason that ever since I was a boy I Ins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my best friends take a different view , but I have always held that position , and I held it because I felt certain that society is so constituted that there can be no difference between the interests of men *and the Interests of women ; and in the second place that if there is any differpee between them the women have a itande , ncy to be conservative , not in the political sense of the word , but to be ta.utious , and that is what we want in the Government a this country . " He was speaking to his audience , he paid , pot as women but as citizens with iltn equal interest in all problems and an equal intelligence to men . Then Mr. onar Law went on : " You have probably noticed that apeeches , articles in the press and cartoons have been full of the expression ( wed by me that there were many who hardly knew where they were and that was one of them . You may be sure that were an indiscretion there will plenty more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , deeds spoke of my simplicity ? he weer ' ood enough , I am glad to say , to 1 - uple honesty with it . There is per-1 s some truth in that . A month ago L I had no idea that I would be called underr012 to face the responsibility that I 20 . V11 undertaken . I am suddenly called take wo n't say to clear up a mess , out ' Undertake the task which it is said liras undertaken by Augustus after the civil commotion in Rome , which was Ito tidy up the Roman Empire . " He - asked how it was possible for a Qovernment until the elections showed Its strength in the country to know where it was , and he then turned his guns on Mr. Lloyd George . " I wonder , " he said , " if the Prime Minister  --  the former I'rime Minister ? knows where he is . I notice that so far he has not issued an election address . I wonder what is the reason . At the time of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as waiters upon Providence . Is It unfair to suggest he is awaiting on Providence as long as possible before ho puts his views into print ' " But there is something more to say under the first subject . After the change he spoke of the condition of this country in this way : ' Here is a splendid going concern , and its successors have come to seize the . profits . ' Three or four days afterward , in Glasgow , he painted the true picture of what the position of this country is ? of danger , anxiety and fear on every side . Both of these pictures can not be true . Can any man who in three days expresses views so different , can he know where he is ? " Then Mr. Boner- Law declared he intended to give another example of his simplicity . He had , made and intended to make no bargain with the press . Ten of the most important editors in Scotland were personal friends of his , but he would make no approaches to them , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its views he would never ' resent it nor retaliate , however hostile they might be . Mr. Boner Law next took up the charges that the Unionist Party had been unfair to Mr. Lloyd George and that in breaking up the coalition it was destroying the only bulwark against labor . The coalition , he . declared , was " an arrangement obviously intended for one Parliament and binding not a moment longer . " And can it be suggested , " he continued , " that because of the great services Mr. Lloyd George rendered , because of the debt of gratitude this country will never fail to pay , he is entitled , whatever our views , to be Prime Minister for the rest of his life ? " To suggest , he argued , that it was necessary to have all men of good will on one side and the Labor Party on the other would do more for the Labor Party than they could do for themselves in twenty years . It would make them the only alternative Government . Tolls Story of the Perfect Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . He was speaking on Lord Balfour 's regret for the coalition as the perfect form of government , and said : " I wonder if any of you recall the story which , when I read his speech , came to my mind . I have not a great recollection of it , for I had not the time to rook it up . I think it is one of Heine 's . " A traveler came to a village and found the people in a tremendous state of excitement . He asked : ' What is the perfect woman . ' He could not understand what they meant , but by the exercise of great energy he succeeded in getting into the apartment where the perfect woman was . She was stretched upon a couch . He gazed at her with ever-increasing admiration , feeling that everything that he could have pictured to himself was there . She was a perfect woman , but , alas . she was dead . " So was the coalition . Believe me , ladies , it was not I who killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lloyd George . The ex-Premier , ho said , had pictured the coalition as a boat floating calmly along a peaceful stream till wrecked by an act of sabotPi ? ? Pr/len he paints himself in this unusual role . I-le is the angel of peace . Laughter . He look upon that destruction brought about by thoughtless , impulsive and indiscreet men . He says to himself : ' It is done , ? what can I do as the angel of peace to prevent the evil from growing greater ? ' It is an unfamiliar role , and I think as he dresses himself for the part it was so unfamiliar that ho made a little mistake . He told us as his first announcement , I think , that he was a free man with his sword in his hand . " Explains Fall of Coalition . Then , striking the table before him , he declared : " The cause of the fall of the Coalition was not intrigue . It was not mutiny , as I heard another of his supporter call It . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of this change was fundamental . The reason for it is that the people in this country everywhere felt that under his rule ' we do n't know where we are today and we can not tell where we will be tomorrow . ' " The abolition of the Cabinet &ereprriat; was the first definite point in his ogram that Bonar Law mentioned and there could be no mistaking the popularity of his proposal , for a loud round of clapping greeted his exposition of his reasons . It was not , he said , merely on the grounds of economy , but because he believed the Secretariat impaired the old machinery of government . " In the great test of the war , " he said , " our Constitution proved itself far superior to any Constitution in the world . Let me illustrate what I mean . Take what happened in connection with Ametica . It so happened ? I am blaming nobody , far from it ? that the President of the United States carried out arrangements which , when the time came , he found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal depended upon the result . In our Constitution that could not have happened . If there had been any doubt as to the people being behind the representatives of the nation , there would have been an election and we would have found out whether there was anything wrong or not . " But there is something else in our Constitution . The Romans , politically , were a very wise people . They had different systems in peace and war . In war they had a dictator . Our Constitution does not lend itself to dictatorship , but our Prime Minister is in reality in a tremendously strong position as long as ho has the support of the House of Commons . He recommends the appointment of all Ministers . He can use tremendous personal power . " During the war we set up a war Cabinet . You had to have things centralized . That was . right in war . But now that we have come back to normal times let us do as the Romans did : let us get back to the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell you what I mean by that . The late Prime Minister is a man not only of tremendous energy , but of really surpassing vitality . ' Whenever any big question emerged , whatever it was , he was expected and he undertook to deal with it . That is not my idea . My idea is that of the man at the head of a big business who allows the work to be done by others and gives it general supervision . That is my idea of the work of the Prime Minister . " Mr. Benda . Law replied to criticisms concerning the number of peers he had appointed to the Cabinet . He had seven . he admitted , but Mr. Lloyd George had had six , and moreover had in the past six months invited both Lord Derby and the Duke of Devonshire to accept office . It was a great mistake , argued the Premier , to suppose new men will not do the work efficiently , and he called to mind Sir James Barrie 's famous address on youth to the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bonar Law , " when I read Sir James Barrie 's address and his account of the peculiar dual nature which belonged to him , I thought ho could not have given a better description of the difference between the late Prime Minister and myself when working together . Let me read it to you : Machonochie , I should explain as I have undertaken to open the innermost doors , is the name I give to the unruly half of myself . I am the half that is dour , and practical , and calm , and canny . That is Scotch . ) He is the fantasy . My desire is to be the family solicitor standing firm on the hearthrug among the harsh realities of office furniture while he prefers to fly around on ope wing . ' " feeling that apart from what was necessary as a result of the war there was a particular hostility to them . " That ought not to be , " he said , " and we must if we can get rid of that notion . That does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks also . Let there he no mistake about that . " He hoped the conference would bring peace and permit Britain to withdraw her troops from the Straits . As for France . he said : " Our relationship with France must be the keynote of owr foreign policy . There is no doubt what that relationship ought to be . We really have ccnimon alms and thought . There may be in the future , as in the past , great differmces of opinion as to the way of securing those aims , and though it may be found that we can not agree ? I hope not  --  this we can do , though I do not say it has not been tried to be done , we can make it plain to France that we are her friends and that we realize that any breach of the understanding between the two countries would be fatal to both and fatal to the world . 1111. we can try to get an agreement between the French and ourselves , realizing that . if we can not get an agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to happen . " Defends Stanley Baldwin . After a kindly reference to Italy 's services in the war . Mr. Bonar Law spoke of the need of reducing expenditure , and referred particularly to the muchcriticised statement of Stanley Baldwin , the new Chancellor of the Exchequer , about the difficulty of dong more than making the budget balance . " Well , ladies , and gentlemen , " said the Premier , " I think he is right to say that . It is easy to make promises . Every opposition nearly all through my experience has been lavish with them . We are really asking you to trust us to do our beat , but do not think we do not realize what it means . " Taxation , the Labor Party , judging by their manifesto , thinks is a rather good thing than otherwise  --  a heavy income tax and all the rest of it . It is not alone something which people grumble at , it is something which is a tremendous handicap to industry , and if we can not get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before we get back to normal prosperity in our industry and commerce . " How is it to be done ? A good deal can bo done , and we mean to try by a reduction in the cost of administration all around . I think a great deal can be done in that way , but the expenditure must depend upon our policy and to what extent we can reduce will depend largely on the sense of security we have throughout the world , that there is no danger of further warlike operations . I am going to ado this : I realize , and so do you , that we must maintain our naval position . " As Mr. Boner Law said this there was a burst of applause . It was by far the heartiest of the whole afternoon . It seemed almost to disconcert the Premier , for he added that they must also remember that the strength of the country depends as much on its financial and industrial position , and they must consider those as well as the military forces . Then as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original tbhi lei mt , the need of tranquility and staWith feeling he spoke of the sufferings from unemployment , sufferings that might be compared to those of the devastated areas of France , and he asked his audience to accept his statement not because he came before them with any hope of being able to work miracles , but because he believed he was the head of a capable and sincere Government that would do what it could to face the difficulties of the position . Speech Disappointing to Many . AMERICA SAVED HER SOUL IN WAR // Compares ex-Premier to Drummer . Mr. Boner Law compared Mr , Lloyd George to a drummer . " It is said , " he went on . " that if Mr. Lloyd George is good in war , why is he not equally good in peace ? I do n't think it quite follows . In a charge on the field of battle the drummer plays a great part , as any of you who have read Kipling 's story of " The Drums of the Fore and Aft " will recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combatants . During the war the drummer was needed not only to keep up the spirit of the men on the field of battle , but was needed equally at home to keep up the courage of all of us who were not at war . Mr. Lloyd George was the drummer . He did that better than any of us could have done , I think . But when the charge is over and some have fallen and some are in the hospital , the drummer would be rather out of Place in the hospital  --  unless his drumsticks were taken from him . " Mr. Boner Law next drew a parallel between the present election and that of 1674 when the Conservatives under Dia. reel ! were returned to power after twenty years in " the wilderness . " He did not profess to have Disraeli 's genius , but he could quote his authority for the Conservatives in their present stand . This led up to a brief statement of Mr. Bonar Law 's views of what the country needs : " I put first , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The empire changed during the war . We must still in negotiation go for the whole , but we must do it by a more close co-operation with the rest of the empire , and we must feel that we have the moral support not of this country alone but of the whole of the British empire . Wants to Quit the Near East . Speaking of the Near East , Mr. Bow Law said it was a great misfortune that the Turks should have had the Comment on Mr. Boner Law 's speech dwells not on what he said but on what he did not say . Even among his warmest supporters there is a good deal of disappointment over matters that he did not touch , upon . There was not a word about Ireland . or Germany reparations . He gave no hint of what is to be his policy in Palestine or Mesopotamia . By passing over these matters he has evaded a good many difficulties , but he had also jeopardized support from several different quarters and has failed to win enthusiasm that a ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the othet section of those who are debating whether they shall back him or not .
