IT has long seemed to me a fitting thing that the nomads among men should give some account of their wanderings to the Spartan souls who carry on the world 's work . This becomes almost an obligation on the part of those who wander from choice ; for they enjoy the privilege only because most of their fellows forego it , that harvests may be gathered , wheels kept turning , and children born and reared in something better than gypsy fashion . Some attempt at a compensation must be made for the great boon of freedom , of foot-looseness . Wayfarers who return disillusioned from their travels should , whenever occasion offers , acknowledge the fact , to the end that those who have remained behind may be the more content with their home-keeping ways . As for the others who return refreshed in body and spirit ? well , this too , perhaps , should be as frankly admitted , if for no better reason than that the Spartan souls may have the sterner enjoyment of self-denial . Thus may all itinerants render some small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the road light-heartedly again . I must confess at the outset that , after a long voyage among island solitudes , I find myself anything but disillusioned by the experience . I sailed for months together over unfrequented seas , touching at islands surpassing in beauty any that I had ever before seen or imagined . I traveled on foot over lofty mountain-ranges , and mused I through long afternoons from some high vantage-point , looking out over an empty azure world . I explored once-populous valleys which the jungle has long since claimed again for her own ; and , at night , I slept under the stars among the ruins of a forgotten civilization . I do not know what , if anything , I was seeking among these lost and lonely lands . Assuredly it was not romance ; and experience had taught me that a conscious search for adventure is as likely as not to prove unsuccessful . But the matter is of no consequence . Finding it necessary to settle clown to something , I decided to settle down to wandering ; and now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed in the choice , both of a vocation and of the rich field where I was to follow it . One adventure , however , I did consciously seek from the beginning of this year of idleness ; and , contrary to probability and to all expectation , it was realized . This may have been clue to the fact that the conception of it was accidental , the adventure itself trivial , and that I entered upon it almost against my will . After a brief sojourn in a tropical island port , ? a jumping-off place in the South Pacific , ? I had taken passage on a trading schooner , and was busy packing my belongings into a sea chest which I had just bought at a Chinaman 's shop . While going through my books , trying to decide what ones I would have most need of during the long absence , it orcurred to me that I had become foolishly dependent upon books for diversion and companionship . ' What an unfortunate habit it is , ' I thought , ' that of forever probing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one 's own ! To be sure , it is a comfortable recreation . It gives one a factitious sense of intellectual wealth ; but there is something ignoble about it when done to excess . Why not give it up , fora time at least ? Why not leave all my books behind ? ' I stopped in the midst of my packing , struck by the daring nature of the idea , trying to realize what a bookless year would mean among remote islands where reading offers almost the only intellectual distraction . Should I make the experiment ? I thought of a dozen good reasons why I should not , but I was forced to put them aside . They were not good enough . No , if I lacked courage now for this temporary enfranchisement , I should remain a book-slave to the end of my days . I decided to abandon my traveler 's library . I would not even take a dictionary or an almanac , not a printed page of any description ? not so much as a newspaper scrapped around a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so complete a renunciation , I altered the plan to this extent : although I would take no books of my own , I would not refuse any which chance might throw in my way . This would give an added zest to the adventure , and it would be interesting to see what sort of literary driftwood had been cast up on these distant islands . Probably I should find nothing . At most , there would be so little that I would be in no danger of overindulgence in reading . So , hastily repacking my box of books , not daring to take a last look at these old friends , I left them where they would be well cared for , and set out for the waterfront . I felt that , assoon as 1 had reached it , I should be committed to my experiment . There could then be no question of turning back . It was just midday , the hour for the siesta , and the avenue bordering the harbor was deserted except for three or four fruit-venders dozing in the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sail lay alongside the wharf . Bunches of green bananas and mountain plantain , baskets of oranges , limes , and mangoes were fastened to the rail along either side , for we were bound for the Low Islands , where mimic of these fruits are to be had . Native passengers were scattered over the forward deck , with their food-boxes and bedding-rolls piled around them ; and in the shelter of a bit of canvas rigged over the main boom , the captain of the vessel , himself a half-caste native , was sleeping beside his Polynesian sailors . The scene was as picturesque , as bizarre , as my northern , inland-bred fancy could desire ; and at another time an hour of leisure would not have sufficed for the enjoyment of it . But now I was eager to be off . The bell in the cathedral tower struck the quarter past , and we were not to sail before two , at the earliest . What should I do meanwhile ? I walked up and down the wharf and fell to thinking of my hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a man who has just renounced smoking longs for tobacco . It was clear that I must find diversions to take the place of reading , something to tide me over these first weeks of abstinence . One occurred to me at the moment : I might make a list of all of the people I had ever known with any intimacy . It seemed absurd , but I was in no position then to be discriminating ; and so , dragging my sea chest into a shady corner and getting out my notebook , I began jotting down the names of people 746 SIR JOHN , MISS AMY , associated with very early childhood ; Nancy Throckmorton , our old nurse ; Mr. Francis , who used to saw our wood in winter ; Dr. Holland , who lost a leg in the Civil War ; John Keipp , who gave me my first hair-cut ; old Mr. Phlaum , who had a little photographic studio on wheels ? I soon had an astonishing list . Here was a diversion which would occupy my leisure indefinitely . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the smell of AIr . Prouty 's harness-shop , where we used to go for whiplashes ; of chalk in musty schoolrooms ; of rain and muddy streets . Little gusts of boyhood emotion swept across the senses . I saw the shadows of naked branches on the snow hi the moonlight , and my mother going down a stairway with a lamp in her hand , and the darkness creeping up the walls behind her . I was interrupted in the midst of this occupation . Someone touched my arm , and , looking up , I saw the proprietor of the hotel where I had been stopping . ' You forgot tins , ' he said , holding out a book . ' One of my girls found it in your room when she was tidying up . It was in the clothespress . You see what trouble I take for my guests ? Ah , this heat ! We must have some rain soon . Well , au revoir ct bon . voyage ! You come back and see me some time . ' He went bustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond , his slippers raising little clouds of dust which hung motionless in the air long after lie had gone . Then , timidly , I looked at the book which he had left . Froissart 's Chronicles of England , France , and Spain . My heart leaped when I read the title , and I shouted mentally , ' It is n't mine ! ' It was n't . It must have been left in the clothespress by some former occupant of the room . Therefore I might keep it . Since the renouncement of my own books became final at the waterfront , I might in JOSEPH , AND CHARLES good faith accept this gift of chance . And what a gift it was ! Froissart 's Chronicles ! It was an ' Everyman ' reprint ; and , as I held it in my hand , the cover fell open at the familiar Shakespeare quotation opposite the title-page : ' This is fairy gold , boy , and ' t will prove so . ' Well I knew it ! I turned the pages at random , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men-at-arms perceived that the first battalion was beaten and the one under the Duke of Normandy in disorder and beginning to open , they hastened to mount their horses , which they had close at hand . As soon as they were all mounted they gave a shout of ' St. George for Guienne ! ' and Sir John Chandos said to the Prince , ' Sir , sir , now push forward for the day is ours ! God will this day put victory in your hand . Let us make for our adversary , the King of France , for where he is will lie the main stress of the business .. . . I well know that his valour will not let him fly , but lie most be well fought with , and you have before said that you will this clay show yourself a good knight . ' The Prince replied , ' John , get forward . You shall not see me turn my back this day ; I will always be among the foremost . ' He then said to Sir John Woodland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of God and St. George ! ' Looking up from the page , I saw the captain of the Kaeo lift his head and look round inquiringly , as if lie had been roused from sleep by that ghostly cry made audible across the centuries . And indeed , such is the magic of Froissart , the air of the drowsy little port seemed loud with the shouts of men who have been in their graves these past five hundred years ; with the thunder of hoofs and the shock of the meeting . I closed the book and tine tumult died away . I heard again the creaking of the schooner 's gangplank , and where had been the plains of Maupertuis and the distant towers of Poictiers , lay the empty lagoon , placid in the shelter of the hills , with the shadow of a cloud moving slowly across it . Thus hopefully began my small adventure , but it would have been too much to expect that the first good fortune would be often repeated . For many a day Sir John Froissart was my only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in the flesh or between the covers of a hook . As the weeks passed I became more and more enamored of the lonely life of the islands . Infrequently I encountered other white men who were enamored of it , too , but to a far greater extent ; men who have willingly cut themselves off from their kind , not for a few months , but for years , for all time . Because of a mistaken sense of compassion for their loneliness , perhaps , I find myself often thinking of these exiles . It seems to me that , if I forget them , they will cease to exist . There was an appalling completeness to their isolation which half convinced me that I have been mistaken in believing such a life more desirable than the herded existence most of us know . And yet there are a few men , singulady endowed , for whom it is , unquestionably , more desirable . I remember very well my meeting with the first of these , for it was then that I made what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had long since left the Kaeo , and was traveling on a thirty-ton native cutter , which was picking up small lots of produce at islands either too poor or too remote to be visited by the larger vessels . The captain was a Low Islander named Tahari , an Atlantean man , an excellent sailor , but with no knowledge of navigation . He depended entirely upon his compass , so that , if we were carried MT our course by winds or currents , weoften cruised about for several days in search of an island , and made landfalls fifty , or even a hundred , miles distant from where we thought we were . This happened one day in late summer , when we had had an unusually anxious time of it . Even Tahari had lost his confidence , and sat at the wheel scanning the unbroken skyline in gloomy silence . At length , by sheer luck , nothing else , we sighted an atoll which lies on the outermost fringe of the far-flung archipelago known as the Cloud of Islands . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the reef had been managed . He ' was about thirty years old , rather slightly built , and dressed native fashion , in a pareu and a pandanus hat . His hair , where not protected by his hat , had been burned to a rusty yellow , and the naked part of his body was quite as brown as those of the natives . I did not see him at first , for I was picking my way among the sea urchins through the shallows behind the reef ; but , hearing English spoken , I looked up quickly . I shall not soon forget how his face beamed at my reply . Jove ! ' he said , ' what a piece of luck ! I thought you might he French , and I have n't talked with an Englishman ? I ca n't remember how long ago it was . ' I told him that I was an American , which seemed to please him none the less . He himself , he said , was English only on his father 's side . His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared in the south of England . There were several tons of copra to be loaded , ant ? as it was then late in the afternoon I willingly accepted his invitation to spend the night ashore . His house stood apart from the others in the village , and like them was wholly of native construction , containing but one room , which was furnished with a wooden chest , a cot , a table , and one chair . 748 Silt JOHN , MISS AMY , looked around the walls for a shelf of hooks , but there was none . Our dinner that evening consisted of a tin of vegetable soup and some fish broiled over an open fire . Afterward we went for a stroll along the lagoon beach , and , our talk having turned to books , I said that I was a little surprised to see none in his house . He then told me that he had formerly been a great reader , but had lost all his books on the way to the islands . He had missed them greatly , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well without them . ' rhe unfortunate thing , ' he said , ' about books , good books , to a man out here , is that they arc too stimulating . If I were to begin reading again , I should become restless . I should want to do something , go somewhere . ' ' Well , ' I replied , would that be such a misfortune ? Do n't you intend ever to leave this place ? Does n't the life become monotonous after a time ? ' ' Not to me . I have enough to think about . I have no desire to leave . ' ' But what do you do with your leisure ? ' I asked . ' I should think you would feel the need of some distraction ? ' ' Oh , I fish , and ? well , if you were not with me to-night , I should be-walking as we are now , along this beach . What need has one for books , for distractions , in a place like this ? ' ' I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man might be very happy if ? ' I did n't finish the sentence , and we were both silent for several minutes . I was trying to imagine what a life of such unrelieved monotony would do to a man in ten years , in twenty . What would this chap be like at the end of his clays , if he remained isolated from his own kind ? Three years had had no noticeable effect upon hint , except , perhaps , that it had given him a pensive cast of countenance and a dreamy , half-reluctant manner of speaking . But I could not see him as an old man . JOSEPH , AND CHARLES Neither could I imagine what sort of a boyhood his had been . He did , however , make one reference to his boyhood , in addition to the earlier one as to where it had been spent . We had returned to his house , and Ile was telling me of the pleasure he got from the reading of old newspapers left him by some trader . He read everything in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside world . News of political events , in particular , interested him . He would conjecture what had led up to them and what might follow , but it was only rarely that he was ever able to learn . Several times he had found his forecasts very accurate . Now and then he came upon a bit of verse copied from some magazine . ' Several months ago , ' he said , ' I found something which pleased me very much . I do n't know just what it is . It does n't appear to he either prose or poetry ; but no matter . It is a description of an autumn day in Venice , but it might have been written of the south of England , where I was born . ' He opened the clothes chest and took from it a scrapbook . ' Oh , yes ! Here it is . ' He moved the lamp closer , and then , in his soft clear voice , read me the following lines : He looked up inquiringly . ' Is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . It makes me homesick . I see our old place in Kent on a quiet November morning , with the leaves falling in little sudden clusters as they do after a heavy frost . I told you that I Mi happy here , but I 'm not ? quite . I miss the good English autumn . I know that it ' s mostly a cold drizzling season , but I remember only the best of it . But what do you call this sort of writing ? is it something new ? ' The lines had been clipped from a Sydney newspaper , but the author 's name was not given . Long afterward , I found them again in a book of Miss Arty Lowell 's . I remember very well the circumstances . I was sitting at a table in the reading-room of a great public library . It was just about the dinner-hour , and most of the frequenters of the place had gone . There was one man , a Mexican , or a Cuban perhaps , sitting opposite me , and at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some papers within the circle of light made by a green-shaded lamp . I had noticed this before , however , or it may have been afterward . At the moment I was seven thousand miles away , on an atoll in the mid-Pacific . I saw the chap with the sunburned hair , with his scrapbook before him and a lamp at his elbow ; and I could hear him saying , ? One , two , three , One , two , five , with the picture in his mind of leaves falling on a windless autumn day in Kent . On leaving the III island of the homesick Englishman , Tahari seta course for an atoll one hundred miles to the southeast ; but head-winds and variable currents caused hint to lose his bearings again , and we went farther astray than ever we had up to that time . After several days of aimless wandering , we sighted a small schooner far to windward . It was an extraordinary piece of lack . Only those who know that lonely part of the Pacific can realize how unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an examination through binoculars , I saw that she was carrying an immense deck-cargo of umber , which was stacked around the galley , cut into short lengths , and corded in every foot of available space . When she was within hailing-distance , her captain , a white man with a great bushy beard , shouted , Ver you going , Sout ' Amerika ? ' Not if I can help it ! ' I shouted back . ' I 'm coming with you if you ' II take me ' ; for I had decided that the South Pacific is no ocean to be sailing with a man of Tahari 's accomplishments . The schooner came into the wind , and the situation having been made clear , the white man consented to take me as passenger , and I was carried over in the small boat . Tahari went with me , and was put right as to his position . We had , in fact , been sailing straight for the coast of South America , about four thousand miles distant . Tahari bade me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence ; and although I afterward made many inquiries , and was constantly on the lookout for a thirty-ton cutter painted blue with yellow trimmings , I neither saw nor heard of it again . My new captain was a Norwegian-German , a loan of about sixty , who had spent most of his life in the islands . He was subject to moods of the most gloomy depression , and talked so convincingly of committing suicide , that I thoroughly believed , at first , that he meant to do it . The cause of his depression was his sense of man 's insignificance . ' I feel so leetle , leetle , leetle ! ' he would say , as we sat on deck looking at the stars . ' I vont to chump ofcrbort . You vait ! Von of dese days wen I get my courach P But within a few hours he would brighten up , and be as genial and care-free as his Paumotuan sailors . He lived at one of the southernmost atolls of the Low Archipelago , and was on his way home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber from a shipwrecked vessel . He gave tote an account of the change in the life at Pitcairn due to the building of the Panama Canal . That old-time hiding-place of the Bounty mutineers load once been the loneliest of all islands ; but now quite frequently steamers bound through the canal to New Zealand and Australia stop there for an hour or two . One came at the time of his visit , and he had carried a load of fruit off to her in his small boat . One of the passengers had given him a bundle of books to take home with him . ' Books ? ' I said ; ' what kind of books ? ' ' Picture-books . You see for yourself . ' He brought out a small bundle of magazines : a copy of Vanity Fair , some Saturday Evening Posts , and several motion-picture periodicals . ' I gif dose to my chilern , ' he said , ' boa dis von is too long to read . Maybe you vant ? ' and he handed me a copy of Conrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a value beyond that of music or of odors as memorials of time and place , and in a moment I was carried back ten years to a noisy little restaurant on Washington Street , Boston , where I first heard of Conrad , of Lord Jint , and to the day spent on a park bench on Boston Common , when I first read it . This first memory has been in no way effaced or supplanted by many subsequent readings ; but the latest one I recall with particular relish , because of the combination of events which made it possible . I shall always regard it as one of the excellent minor results of the building of the Panama Canal , more than adequate compensation for weeks of anxiety on a thirty-ton cu ( ter , and the good in an ill wind which drove a three-masted lumber-laden schooner on the rocks at Pitcairn . IV When next I had an opportunity to continue my wanderings , I followed a deviating course for two months , almost forgetting my quest for bookish adventure in the interest of changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Froissart 's Chronicles lay undisturbed in the bottom of my sea chest , while the chest itself , becoming more and more scarred and weather-stained , was carried over beaches of sun-bleach. ed coral in the Low Islands , along slippery valley-trails under the deep shade of the maple trees of the high islands . At length , at the close of summer , it was set down on a verandah t hat overlooks one of the least frequented ocean-reaches in all the South Pacific . There , in all truth , were I doubt whether , since the dawn of steam navigation , a smudge of smoke has ever stained the purity of the skies above it . Once in five or six months , a small schooner , such as the one in which I was traveling , creeps above the rim of the horizon , bringing a bag of mail to the solitary white resident , another exile , and supplies of tinned food sufficient to relieve a diet of cocoanuts and fish during the period until the neat visit . During the rest of the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five inhabitants . I spent a week with him while the schooner was visiting another island seventy-five miles distant . I was reluctant to accept leis hospitality for so long a time ; but it seemed genuinely offered , and when he told me he had a library I might enjoy browsing through , I could not refuse so excellent an opportunity for carrying on my researches . ' My library , ' he called it . I could sec that he was proud of it , and he had reason to be . After a brief examination , it was clear to use that here was no crazy edifice built of odds and ends of literary driftwood , but a fine structure , thoughtfully and solidly erected . It was like a bridge , spanning this island solitude and the outside world ; like a splendid aqueduct , along which flowed a stream of living thought . During the mornings I explored the island with my host , or we fished from a canoe anchored to a mushroom of coral which rose from the bottom of the lagoon about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evenings sat with books piled around us , reading and talking until the small hours . I have never seen any place congenial to the reading of books that could compare with my host 's verandah . The nights were cool and fresh ; there were no insect annoyances , and one could read hour after hour , without so much as a moth knocking against the shaded lamp . A broad stairway gave directly upon the waters of the outer lagoon , about a half a mile wide at that point . Beyond lay the barrier reef , where the surf , piling up in smooth combers , broke evenly , with a reverberating boom , followed by a long-drawn-out sigh as the sea foamed over the shallows to the beach . Beyond that , in turn , lay the open sea , unbroken by any land for over sixty-five degrees of longitude . Oh ! it was the idealization of a book-lover 's paradise ; and that I should have found there a volume which had been the object of a long and fruitless search ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookless experiment so worth while . The book was the narrative of the voyage of the missionary ship Duff to the islands of the South Pacific ? a voyage undertaken in the years 1796-97-98 , when such travel was a hazardous business . I had long known of its existence , but all my inquiries had been to no purpose . The Voyage of the Duff ? No one seemingly had ever heard of it , and yet I knew that , at the time of its publication , in 1799 , the list of subscribers had numbered more than fifteen hundred . What had become of all those old copies , with their charts of islands then almost unknown , and their engravings of strange idyllic scenes on the shores of heat hen lands ? The question as to one of them was answered by my host during the first evening that I spent with him . ' Here , ' he said , is something you will enjoy ' ; and he placed the volume in my hands . Enjoy it ? Indeed I did ! It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere of modern books of travel . It is made up largely of excerpts from the diaries of those who were sent on this first great christianizing enterprise of the London Missionary Society ? a consecutive story , in minute and fascinating detail , of their wanderings from the time of leaving England ; their sojourn in the islands , where mission stations were established ; their observations on the life around them ; their attempts at christianizing savages ; and the book closes with an account of the return of the Duff , three years later , empty of her passengers , who had remained in exile to carry on the work for which they believed themselves chosen by a Divine Providence . Night after night I read on in this obscure Odyssey , marveling at the freshness of its interest after all these years , the dignity and beauty of its language , the simple unquestioning minds of its creators and their stores of mountain-moving faith . It was impossible not to smile now and then at their ejaculatory piety . Nothing happened during the entire course of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . One of them thus chronicles an event which took place on shipboard during the five months ' voyage to Tahiti : ? 752 SIR JOHN , MISS AMY , JOSEPH , AND CHARLES This afternoon we witnessed a remarkable interference of Divine Providence in our favour . The pitch-kettle being placed on the fire by the carpenter whilst caulking the decks , the man who was left in charge of it suffered it to boil over . Immediately it blazed up with surprising fury . He had , however , the presence of mind to lift it off the fire and prevent the dreadful conflagration . Through the goodness of God no harm was done , and the fire put out in an instant . Oh ! the wonders of His care who hath said : ' He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of My eye ! ' The bounty of nature , the genial climate , and the beauty of the islands gave the missionaries cause for much concern . They were in constant fear lest they should consciously enjoy themselves in this tropical Eden ; lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortly after the arrival of the Duff at Tahiti , another of them wrote in his journal : Oh Lord !

Oh ! put more grace and gratitude into my poor cold heart , and grant that I may never , like Jeshurun , grow fat and kick . Alas ! two of the ship 's company did follow the example of Jeshurun ? John Micklewright , the captain 's steward , and Samuel Templeton , the cabin boy . Five months at sea , under the close supervision of the missionaries , with ' the songs of Zion rising continually over the deep , ' as the record says , was a little too much for them . At the first opportunity , they escaped into the bush ; they could neither be captured nor persuaded to return .

As for the man himself , I can still sec him striding along the one street of the village , his mind occupied with a round of small duties , and the innumerable concerns of the islanders . I have often wondered , since , what could be the secret of his content . Not mere love of books . He is too rugged for that . In energy , in the healthiness of his outlook , in the conscious enjoyment of the life he had chosen and the keenness of his interest in what is faking place in the world at large , he stands apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of lonely wandering .

His satisfaction in the accomplishment of it seemed grotesquely out of proportion to the task itself . It is long since we said good-bye , but my recollection of him is as clear as tropical sunlight , and as warm as his hospitality during one of the pleasantest weeks I have ever read . V After a period of overindulgence , it was in keeping with the nature and intent of my experiment that there should be a long interval of abstinence : and so it happened . Then I made a fourth and last addition to my library , which came so seasonably to the day , that I am reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played toe persistently benevolent a part in my trivial adventures . However , I can but tell of the event as it occurred . I was at that time a passenger on a three-toasted schooner whose captain , one of the most genial and reminiscent of all South Sea skippers , has been trading in the Eastern Pacific since the late seventies . One of the first things I noticed was that he used his dividers for cleaning his pipe , and that he took tie observations . The log , beautifully burnished and polished , hung from a hook in his cabin . I saw no sextant , although there was a chronometer ticking in a little cabinet above his bunk . I keep it wound up , ' he told me later . Sort of habit . You get used to doing a thing , and you ca n't leave off ; but for all the use I make of it , I might as well chuck it overboard .

Then , without a hint of a smile , he said , We ' ll pick up Fakarava at four-thirty . ' We did n't , however . We did n't sight it until twenty minutes to five , and then it was from the masthead . The captain explained that the error was due to the fact that the water had been drawn too close to the vessel 's side . ' It 's got to be clean , ' he added .

' After some talk about the price . of copra , the Scotchman was invited to have dinner on board . Are you going to have Irish potatoes , Joe ? ' he asked . ' I 'm sorry , Mac . We have n't a spud left . We used up the last of them about a week ago .

' You better come and have a look at my books first , ' he replied . ' Maybe you wo n't want to trade . ' We followed him to his store , a tumble-down shed made of bits of corrugat - ed iron , the boards of old packing-cases , and roofed with biscuit-tins hammered out flat . The room was almost bare of trade-goods . There was a half-barrel of flour in one corner , and some unsacked copra in another . A bolt of pareu cloth , faded at the edges , lay on a dusty shelf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the counter there was a pile of empty nail-kegs . The Scotehman brought out his read ingonat tor , a copra sack half filled with it . 1 made no examination of the contents then , except to assure myself that by the Word books ' he meant , as did the captain , magazines ? story magazines of the sort which have a ' Camp-Fire Column ' among the back pages , Where the readers get together , to discuss With the editor the merits of The Purple Abyss and The Lagoon of Passion . A week later I was traveling on horseback in Typee , one of the largest as well as the most gloomy and lonely of Marquesan valleys . The schooner had gone on t o the /text settlement . the day before , but . I had decided to make the journey overland , for I wanted to see what changes had taken place in the valley since Melville had written of it eighty years ago . I found a settlement of twenty or thirty inhabitants on the sea-coast , but in the depths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been long in their graves and they have left no descendants . For miles on both sides of the stream , the great stone paepaes ? the foundations on which they built their houses ? are overgrown with brush and trees , but standing four-square still , enduring memorials of a splendid primitive race . It was a cloudless midsummer day ? midsummer for the tropics , but I remembered that it was Christmas day at home . I tried to picture the scene there : the snowy fields , the frosted window-panes , people walking briskly along the streets , blowing out clouds of steam , the Wall light of a winter afternoon , the gathering dusk , with lights coming out in houses where families JOSEPH , AND CHARLES were gathering for their annual reading of the Christmas Carol . There was no seasonable reminder of the day in Typee Valley . The tops or the mountains and the high plateaus were in full sunshine , and in the depths of the valley itself the air was mild . My horse picked his way slowly over the stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little errs . Lures peculiar to the islands , flew round and round in pools of sunlight and shadow , the nutter of their wings scarcely ruffling the surface of silence . Occasionally it was more deeply disturbed by the bawling of wild cattle far up in the hills ; or that most melancholy of birds , the kakis , burst suddenly into its monotonous song : a despairing Oh-eh oh-oh-oh dying away to silence . No , there was not a hint of Christmas in Typee Valley , and I was glad to gel back to the schooner where I could at least talk of it to the captain of the Tahitian Maiden . I found him in his cabin sorting , by dates , the books - Which the Scotchman had given him . Well , ' he said , ' what do you smell ? ' I sniffed the air and then said that I smelled dried copra ? as usual . What ! Do you mean to tell use that you do n't smell beef , fresh beef ? You 've never been a sailor , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in about an hour you 're going to have some of the finest beefsteak you ever tasted . How ' s I lust for Christmas dinner ? And here 's another Christmas present for you , one of Mac 's books . ' He handed me a V011atle , originally in paper covers , but these had been torts off . The first page had been well thumbed and the print dimmed Willt grease and dirt . But it was still legible. and in the first paragraph I learned that Marley was dead . There was no doubt of it , he was as dead as a door-nail.
