The situation was best described in a political cartoon of the moment : A valet , perched precariously on a window-ledge and peeking in through a lighted window at a damsel within , gestured excitedly to a gallant standing below . Another gallant was striding off down the street , having evidently refused the invitation . The gallant under the window eyed his departing peer . What to do ? <P> The valet was labeled " Peek . " The damsel , who might have been either weeping or sleeping , was labeled " Farm Vote . " The departing gallant wore a haughty " G. O. P. " label . The dubious gallant bore an unmistakable resemblance to Nominee Smith , and to make certainty certain , Cartoonist Homer Speltz of the Gopher Prairie , Wha. , * Clarion had labeled the figure " Dem . " <P> " Peek , " of course , was George Nelson Peek , the Democrat-Republican from Illinois who used to make plows at Moline , Ill. ; who served Woodrow Wilson on the War Industries Board ; who became chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Hammill ( Republican ) of Iowa+ and other Farmers ' Friends ; and who lobbied the McNary-Haugen Bill ( first version ) through Congress from a desk in Vice President Dawes ' ante-room. ** <P> After the second vetoing of the McNary-Haugen bill last spring , Mr. Peek threatened the Republican Party with dire happenings . Nothing happened . Then he went to Houston and had the satisfaction of seeing the controversial principle of McNary-Haugenism written into the Democratic platform . He visited Manhattan last week to learn how the Democrats proposed to elaborate their platform . He arrived with assurances , much like those he voiced prior to the G. O. P. convention , that the Farmer was angry at the G. O. P. , that the Farm Problem could be solved by McNary-Haugenism and by nothing else . <P> Farmers ' Friend Peek is a stalwart gentleman , middleaged , enthusiastic , virile . He photographs like a professional wrestler , with his big broad chin tucked down toward his collar so that his neck swells . Chairman Raskob of the Democratic National Committee took a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a statement saying that he himself did not know so much about the Equalization Fee , but that the Farm Problem would be solved by " sane fundamentals and sound economics . " <P> When Nominee Smith returned from an ocean bath on Long Island , he breakfasted with Mr. Peek . After breakfast Nominee Smith said he was more than ever satisfied with the Democratic plank on agriculture . Forthwith , Mr. Peek declared himself a Smith man . The press headlined : " G. O. P. Farm Chief Goes Over to Smith . " <P> Then the New York World published an editorial . It said that , evidently , Nominee Smith regarded the principle of McNary-Haugenism as a good thing , but that the plan of it was bad . Nominee Smith approved the World 's interpretation . Mr. Peek , now a Smith man , said nothing . Chairman Raskob announced the formation of a committee to supervise a strenuous fight for Corn Belt votes . It was also announced that the Democrats were in a better position to win one or more of the 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worried .
