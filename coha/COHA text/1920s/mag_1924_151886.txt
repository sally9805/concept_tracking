Lily of the Dust . The German . Hermann Sudermann , cornered considerable applause when he wrote The Song of Songs . Later , Edward Sheldon brought it to life behind the footlights . In the natural course of events , its next metamorphosis was into celluloid . Famous Players were the alchemists ; Pola Negri the heroine ; and Lily of the Dust the title . <P> The small body of professionals and the huge mass of private commentators on the cinema who possess a respect for literature have been raging against the tampering with titles these many years . Yet the manufacturers contend that thereby is their product the more easily and widely marketed . Therefore , Lily of the Dust . Which simply goes again to prove that the cheaper the materials involved in the manufacture of an article , the greater the profit . Pola Negri gives a perfect performance of Pola Negri . But as Sudermann 's Lilly Czepanek ( tall , fair and willowy ) , old friends of the book will disagree with her . Yet for the millions who want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributes one of the finest performances she has given since her films began to be stamped " made in America . " <P> The story leads her from an obscure position as librarian to marriage with a German Colonel ( Noah Beery ) ; to the arms of a young Lieutenant ( Ben Lyon ) ; and finally to an unhappy ending . In the elaboration of the story the picture develops its highest values . By kindling a spark of interest that smoulders steadily , bursting into flame with the shrewdly-considered climax , it marks a notable achievement for director Dimitri Buchowetski . <P> Messalina . Ennio was only a Persian slave who asked nothing but to be left alone with Ela , the little Greek girl . Roman life in 41 A.D. , he found , was more complicated than that . He was too handsome . Before the picture was half unreeled the Empress and one of the most luxuriously affluent Princesses were contending for his favor . Finally , he smashed up his chariot in the great race in the circus . None of this narrative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for values , one finds the picture useful chiefly as a reincarnation of Latin life . The forum , the circus and the homes of the patricians were carefully and generously revived . The Italian cast , led by Rina de Liguoro , fitted favorably enough . If the drama could be deleted , the picture would make an excellent adjunct to any school 's efforts to instil into the stubborn minds of students the glory and " the grandeur that was Rome .
