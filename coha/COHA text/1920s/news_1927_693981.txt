txt Signed by eminent names , representing various courts and bar associations , the report of the Special Committee appointed by the Appellate Division to inquire into the causes of the congestion of calendars and the delays of justice invites serious study . These delays spring , we are told , from no fault of the courts but from the immense increase in their business . The growth of population and the complexity of modern economic organization have often been called the main causes of this ; but it seems that the automobiles jam the courts , as they jam the streets . Of the suits in tort which take up more than half the Supreme Court calendar , most are cases of alleged negligence in automobile accidents . The City Court is even more flooded with them and the Municipal Court nearly swamped . The committee has been pondering a plan of partial relief , through a compulsory automobile insurance law and an administrative board to award damages ; but this would require legislation which is perhaps distant . The committee unweariedly renews recommendations , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of these experts , but the reiterated proposal to penalize lawyers who bring groundless suits or willfully cause delays seems unlikely to be acted upon . What the Legislature can and should do is to force petty cases upon the inferior courts , to the benefit of the Supreme Court . It should also authorize the Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division to enlarge the number of official referees . Emergency legislation , empowering the Court to name forty or fifty lawyers as judicial officers without pay for the trial of jury cases during the emergency . is perhaps a pious hope rather than a probability . When we come to the Municipal Courts . we realize that the administration of justice is or should be a unit . Reducing their own conIgestion , the Supreme Court and the 1City Court swelled that of the Municipal Courts . In these on Jan. 1 there were 235,000 cases . These courts come nearer to the business and bosom of the ordinary man than their more illustrious brethren . There , if anywhere , justice should take the lead off her heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , again urged by the report . It has also refused to reorganize the forty-eight Municipal Court Judges under a Chief Justice who is to act as their executive head . The extraordinary results of such a system in Cleveland were recorded in Tuesday 's NEW YORK TIMES . We return to what may be called the unification of the courts . Eight States have established Judicial Councils . Kansas has lately passed an act for such a body . Connecticut will have one on July 1 . The work of the Massachusetts Judicial Council has been particularly valuable . The underlying conception is the careful , constant observation of all the courts of the State , both with respect to procedure and administration . The observers are a small number of Judges and lawyers and the Chairmen of the Judiciary Legislative Committees . Thus the Leg ' islature has an active part and is ' more apt to enact those necessary changes for which our Judges and lawyers have so often asked in vain . This cooperation of bars court and Legislature has been urged in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . "
