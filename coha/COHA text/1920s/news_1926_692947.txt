txt Last year the Board of Transportation entered into subway contracts to the amount of nearly $85,000,000 , of which sum all but $7,000,000 was absorbed by the ' new west side trunk line . It is doubtless to meet these obligations that Chairman . DELANEY announces that his board must have $75,000,000 in hand by September . The Board of Estimate must find the money " even though it breaks them . " No funds are to be obtained by further borrowing until next March . Whether the Board of Estimate cracks under the strain or manages somehow to rake up the wherewithal , it can not complain of being taken by surprise . Neither can the community at large . Repeatedly the Board of Transportation through its Chairman has warned the city of the problem it faces . Transit has the first call . But if , a ; a result , other municipal improvements are suspended , " as it appears they must be , " Mr. DELANEY wrote in May , 1925 , " the accumulated deficiency in schools , sewers , highways " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to equal ' the . " present transit situation . " For an indefinite number of years , therefore , it seems fated that municipal finance in New York shall rot move forward in balanced and orderl ' fashion , but that we shall stagger from one distress into another . At the present moment the transit situation is intolerable . It is being met , in the way of new subway construction , by straining the city 's resources to the utmost . By anticipation and utilization of increased taxes from higher realty assessments , and , chiefly , by availing one 's self of the ' 4300,000,000 debt limit exemption authorized by the Legislature andl ratified by the people , but not coming into effect until 1927 , , the new subways will be somehow built . But long before the rails are being laid in the new tunnel the city will be compelled to face the problem of starved schools and delayed improvements . Whereupon the city will stagger forward to the new distressing situation . It promises to be the most distressful municipality that ever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next , living from hand to mouth and in a perpetual sweat  --  the process may not seem particularly anomalous to the optimistic citizens of the- metropolis of the most optimistic nation on earth . Who can tell , says Mr. OLVANY , what New York ten years hence will.be like ? Why bother about 5-cent fare or no 5-cent fare , since the law prescribes that the 5-cent fare shall obtain for the first three years of operation on the new subways that have still four years to build ? Seven ? or ten  --  years from now the compressibility of the New York subway passenger may have been doubled , and three straphangers may be crowded into the space which nature designed for one . Before seven years have elapsed another and greater building boom : may have% struck the city and real estate assessments may be topping the dreams of avarice . In the meanwhile one can borrow here , and postpone there , and trust to luck everywhere , and so govern the richest city on earth .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
