Sleeping Passengers . Those who have flown as passengers to a definite destination know that , except for a few minutes after the takeoff , the trip becomes monotonous . William Bushnell Stout who makes all-metal planes for Ford Motor Co. and who is an executive of both Northwest Airways and Stout Air Services , remarked at Lehigh University last week that two out of five air passengers sleep enroute . In Germany last week one George Hermann slept so soundly while the Junkers plane on which he was a passenger bucked and twisted to a crash , that he knew nothing of the trouble until the smash-up made him bite off his tongue . <P> Colombia 's Lt. Benny . Lieutenant Benjamin Mendez , young Colombian flyer , affectionately called " Benny " at the Curtiss Flying Field where he trained , was still at Balboa , Panama Canal Zone , last week . Three weeks ago he kissed Manhattan friends goodbye and started to fly to Bogota , Colombia , in his Curtiss seaplane , the Ricaurte ( TIME , Dec. 3 ) . He cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then two weeks ago he insisted on leading a fleet of welcoming planes into Colon Bay . Overeager to alight , he pitched into the water . Last week his Ricaurte was not yet repaired . The U.S. War Department offered him an Army plane wherewith to complete his voyage . Said Lt. Benny , sharply aware of his flight 's significance to his native Colombia : " It was very considerate . However , I shall finish my trip in my own plane . " <P> Peru 's Circumnavigators . Intrepid Peruvians , Carlos Martinez de Pinillos and Carlos Zegarra , bought a Bellanca plane in New York and last week started to fly from Lima , Peru , back to Manhattan . But not by the shortest way . They are first circumnavigating the western , southern , and eastern edges of South America , stopping at the capitals of the various countries . Santiago , Chile , was their first visiting place . <P> Costa Rica 's Gonzales . G. Gonzalez , son of Costa Rica 's President Cleto Gonzalez , pleaded , argued , cajoled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fellow passengers on the Pan-American Mail liner Colombia , bound for the Canal Zone . At the Canal Zone the flyers intend to fly to Costa Rica . Young Gonzalez wants to go along , to spend Christmas at the Costa Rican presidential palace . But aboard the steamship they would not promise him the trip . There might be an accident ; he might be killed . The father Gonzalez would be pained , Costa Ricans vexed . <P> Wave-Riding Romar . Waves , 12 to 16 feet high , curvetted over each other as the huge German Rohrbach seaplane Romar roared over them in fractious test flight last week . The Rotnar alighted , ploughed through the flapping crests , took to the sprayed air again . The test of her seaworthiness was satisfactory , pleasing .
