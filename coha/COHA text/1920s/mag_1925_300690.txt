Last week George V. , modest Imperator et Rex , felt stirring within him that urge toward pheasant shooting which in his youth caused him to become one of the crack bird-shots of the Empire . While the Prince of Wales spurred madly after foxes and Queen Mary occupied herself with vague housewifely duties at Buckingham Palace , King George set out for his annual visit to Elveden Hall in Suffolk , where some of the finest pheasant and partridge shooting in England is to be had . <P> As all good-grade Britishers know , the owner " of Elveden Hall is the luxury-loving Viscount Elveden , first Earl of Iveagh . At 78 he is one of the most notable British exponents of la chasse de luxe . His huntsmen-guests are dined wherever they chance to find themselves at mealtimes , with the aid of an especially built traveling kitchen . Throughout his almost limitless estates there are scattered more than a sufficient number of hunting lodges , at which opulent shelter is to be had . <P> Sneered certain backbiting gossips : " The King has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his millions out of Guinness Stout . He has been an Earl for only six years . " <P> Others said , " The King is reported to find the informality at Elveden refreshing . It is significant that Colonel Walter Guinness , Lord Iveagh 's younger son , has recently been appointed Minister of Agriculture in succession to E. F. L. Wood , who will go to India as Viceroy , succeeding Lord Reading . "
