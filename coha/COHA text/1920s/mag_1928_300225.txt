Two years ago , stores , theatres ard even churches in Omaha were closed and darkened after nightfall for fear of the " phantom sniper , " a creature who , invisible for nearly two weeks , moved through the evening streets firing a silent pistol at whatever human targets took his fancy in the house windows or under streetlights . A contractor was first to die . Then a doctor was slain in his office . A railroad detective was riddled in the freight yards . A bullet smashed past a girl at a drugstore counter . The " phantom " also went shooting in Council Bluffs , Iowa , across the Missouri River . His weapon made only a muffled chug in the night as his lead whizzed after pedestrians and into people 's homes . <P> A gang of railroad workers captured the " phantom " in Omaha 's outskirts , walking the ties . He was a 45-year-old maniac named Frank Carter . He boasted about his marksmanship , displayed his .22 calibre automatic with silencer attachment . He had been paroled from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still wanted to " Kill , Kill , Kill , " he said . Nebraska hanged him . <P> Last week Omaha had something worse . <P> An old expressman named Joseph Blackman was found murdered in sleep , his head hacked . A bloody hatchet lay near the house . <P> Waldo Resso , a milkman , found his 21-year-old wife and her 18-year-old sister stripped , hacked , dead . The Resso 's three children were untouched . <P> A Mrs. Harold Stribling woke up in the night . The light was on . A young Negro was in the room , clutching a hatchet . Mrs. Stribling 's husband , a powerful man , lay dying in the bed , his head mangled . The Negro chopped at Mrs. Stribling , gashed her over the eye . She begged for mercy . " Well , then , go and wash your face , " he said . He went with her , washed his hands . He asked to see her baby and stood over its crib for several minutes . Like a mother partridge playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He took her to the swamps on the edge of town . . . . She got to a hospital , half-crazed . <P> Omaha 's police were mustered out for night duty , 500 strong . They patrolled the streets in squads . Twenty dusky suspects were taken into custody , but none had a hatchet . Mrs. Stribling thought she recognized her attacker in Jake Bird , a 24-year-old ex-convict , though Bird was black and Mrs. Stribling had described the hatcheteer as copper-colored . Bird was hustled to the State penitentiary for safekeeping . <P> Most deeply concerned about catching Omaha 's hatchet-man was Omaha 's new police-chief , John J. ( " Gentleman Jack " ) Pszanowski . Chief Pszanowski , a Polish miner 's son who began walking a beat in Omaha 20 years ago and reached his present eminence last July , is something new in police chiefs . He does not believe in violence . He is supposed to have used his night stick only twice in his career . Says he : " The day of the bully is done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must so conduct ourselves , in our relations with the public , that we shall be regarded as public servants who know the rules of courtesy as well as the means of capturing a criminal . " The " third degree " ( arm-twisting , dazzling with a light , beating with a hose ) is not used to extort confessions in Omaha .
