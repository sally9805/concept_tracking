After greeting Nominee Robinson in Albany , and with him patting " the donk " ( baby , Houston , newborn jackass foal ) Nominee Smith went to Manhattan to see after the new political machinery of the Democracy . He knew what he wanted . <P> The session at the Hotel Biltmore was long and late ( 3 a. m . ) . Present were Nominee Robinson , Nominator Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Tammanyites George W. Olvany , Judge Joseph M. Proskauer , James A. Foley and Joseph Tumulty ; also Senators Hawes of Missouri and Harrison of Mississippi . Nominee Smith was there , too . When they went to bed they all knew what they wanted . <P> Funds . In view of what was coming , the first announcement at next morning 's meeting of the National Democratic Committee was not particularly significant . Jesse Holman Jones , retiring Director of Finance and " angel " of the Democracy the past four years , reported that the $84,000 Houston convention was all paid for and that a balance of some $200,000 remained for campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josiah Marvel , a swarthy , elderly country gentleman from Delaware . Mr. Marvel said that Delaware offered to the Democracy a manager who could think the way average Americans think from trolley conductors to potent capitalists . He nominated John Jacob Raskob of Delaware for chairman of the committee . Mr. Raskob was unanimously elected . The committee elected other officers as follows : <P> Vice Chairmen-Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City , a shrewd local boss ( not without aspersions on his political reputation ) ; Governor Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia , industrious , patrician ; Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming , onetime ( 1025-27 ) Governor ; onetime ( 1907-21 ) U. S. Representative Scott Ferris of Oklahoma , farmers ' friend ; Florence Gardiner Farley of Kansas , famed suffragette . <P> Treasurer-onetime ( 1913-17 ) Ambassador-to-Germany James Watson Gerard of Manhattan , brilliant opportunist ( re-elected ) . <P> Secretary-Charles A. Greathouse of Indiana ( re-elected ) . <P> Chairman of Finance-Herbert H. Lehman of Manhattan , Jewish banker , long time friend of Nominee Smith . This appointment was an outcropping ' of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political resources . Potent Jews seem to be preponderantly Democratic this year . Many of them were Woodrow Wilson 's friends . They include Bernard Mannes Baruch , Jesse Isidore Straus , * Louis Marshal , Julius Rosenwald , Otto Hermann Kahn , Philadelphia 's Gimbels . <P> Advisory Chairman-Peter Gollet Gerry , the wealthy well-born Harvard-bred hound-riding U. S. Senator from Rhode Island who upset traditional Republican calculations in his state as a young man ( 1916-he is now 48 ) and has since continued popular with his state 's large labor vote . <P> The Raskob appointment merits historical recitation . <P> After the first quarter of the century the Democratic party was awakened by its metropolitan members to the realization that politics had become Big Business and Big Business politics in the U. S. Long before Gov . Smith 's nomination it was known that he would refashion the popular concept of his party , perhaps by a preelection indication of outstanding businessmen whom he would ask to help him conduct the government if he were elected ( TIME , March 12 ) .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
