Methodist Episcopal clergymen of Philadelphia met last week at a terrible table . Upon it lay a copy of the Epworth Herald , organ of the Methodist young " people 's society . It was open to an article contributed by Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick , famed Liberal . <P> Without a " nay , " although some of the clergymen present did not vote , the meeting adopted a resolution threatening to boycott Epworth Editor Edward J. Gratz if he continued to print articles by Dr. Fosdick . No quibblers , they sharply pronounced as follows : " Upon the article named we have no special criticism , but upon his admission to the paper under any caption we have definite criticism . " <P> It went on to point out that Dr. Fosdick had in the past qualified as legendary several gospel miracles , including : the fish with the coin in its mouth ( St. Matt . XVII , 27 ) , the walking on the water ( St. Matt . XIV , 25:29 ; St. Mark VI , 48:50 ; St. John VI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Matt . XXI , 19 ) . It charged also that Dr. Fosdick does not believe in the resurrection of Christ . <P> These beliefs were called Unitarian . But Dr. Fosdick is not , like Chief Justice William Howard Taft , a Unitarian ; he is a Baptist , pastor of the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Manhattan . He has already been target for the thunders of Presbyterians , when he was preaching at the First Presbyterian Church in Manhattan . At that time he saw fit to quit his pulpit ( TIME , March 9 , 1925 ) . <P> Hot on the pronouncement of the Methodist boycott threat , flames leaped one night in the nearly completed $4,000,000 Riverside Church , being built by John Davison Rockefeller Jr . on Riverside Drive for Dr. Fosdick . Feeding on a forest of scaffolding in the nave , they gutted the building , left it an empty shell of blackened walls . The damage was estimated at $1,000,000 . It was the third time in the last two months fire has broken out in the church .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
