Radio Corp . of America owns or has virtual controlling interest in RCA Communications , Inc. and Radiomarine Corp . ( communications ) , RCA Photophone Co. ( sound-film recording and receiving equipment ) , Radio-Victor Corp . ( radio sets and talking machines ) , Radio-Keith Orpheum Corp . ( vaudeville circuits and theatres ) , RKO Productions , Inc. ( cinema production ) , National Broadcasting Co. ( broadcasting ) . Recently it acquired an option on the patents for the Theremin " ether wave " musical instrument , which is played by moving the hands in the air above it . Entertainment , therefore , and particularly musical entertainment , is Radio Corp . ' s forte . Last week it went further into music . National Broadcasting Co. announced that with music publishers Leo Feist , Inc. and Carl Fischer it had formed a new publishing house : Radio Music Corp. , capitalized at $6,600,000 . NBC owns one-third of the capital stock . RKO Productions , Inc. therefore , like every other important cinema company , will have its own music publishers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically every phase of public entertainment . <P> Obviously if sound movie producers use a song published by somebody else , they get no royalties , may have to pay some . Example : Warner Bros , purchased " Sonny Boy , " published and written by De Sylva , Brown &; Henderson , with lyric changes by Al Jolson . Estimated royalties were upward of $750,000 , of which Warner Bros , received not a cent . Warner Bros , learned a lesson , purchased Witmarks Inc. for approximately $5,000,000. * Radio Corp . seemed last week to have learned that lesson too . A contracted composer for Leo Feist , Inc. is Mabel Wayne , composer of " Ramona , " and considered the best Feist music writer . Confidently last week cinemen predicted that RKO Productions , Inc. would soon produce a sound movie with a Wayne theme song . And , they pointed out , royalties from the sale of copies and records would go not only to Fischer and Feist but also to Radio Corp . ' s NBC ( actually Radio Corp . owns 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% ) . <P> Radio Music Co. has another function . It intends to discover new music , encourage new composers . It is tired of jazz , wants melody . Its President Edwin Claude Mills+ last week said : " We are not interested in ' reform . ' We are not trying to get ourselves into such a rarified atmosphere that nobody could live in it with us . . . . We have had perhaps too much of jazz and it seems about time for some one to assume leadership in a movement away from the cacophony of most music of the day . I think we should get back to melody . " <P> Radio Music Co. intends to form a board of musical judges . The classical will be represented by such men as Walter Damrosch , Tin Pan Alley by such connoisseurs as Feist 's Edgar Bitner . Anybody who has written a musical composition may submit it . To ensure unprejudiced judgments the board will be kept in ignorance of the composer 's name . If a composition is accepted , Radio Music Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Productions perhaps may make of it a theme song , Radio-Victor will make records of it . But in all cases Radio Corp . of America will profit thereby .
