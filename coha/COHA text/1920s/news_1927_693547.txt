txt Pieces of an airplane wing , a shattered propeller and other wreckage drifted ashore yesterday off the Island Beach Life-Saving Station near Damegat Inlet , all that was found to indicate a tragedy which occurred on Thursday afternoon when an army airplane ' with a pilot and a passenger bound from gtitchel Field , L. I. , to Langley Field , near Washington , dropped into the ocean . The pilot , Lieutenant Willard L. Harris , and his passenger , Lieutenant William A. Gray , both of Langley Field , are believed to have been drowned . It is supposed that their bodies are still entangled in the sunken fuselage of the plane . The accident was apparently due to a heavy fog into which the plane flew as it approached the New Jersey coast , and which prevented search being made yesterday for the victims by other pilots . Air officers of Mitchel Field said that the plane must have been flying very low to keep under the fog , and that it is difficult for a pilot to tell from the air where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific force was indicated by the fact that the landing gear , one wheel wrenched from the axle , was broken off and ' washed ashore . Sea and Fog Hamper Search . This landing gear and the pieces of wing and propeller were all that were cast up by the sea to Indicate the quick tragedy that had occurred . An hour and a half before this wreckage was found , the plane had been seen winging its way south , low over the water . What happened in the next few minutes after it passed from view will not be known until the fuselage , held down by the heavy motor , is found . It could not be found last night because of a heavy sea and fog , which made a search by ' the Coast Guards impossible and rendered futile the desire of fellow-aviators in the army and navy air services to fly out in the hope that they might find the bodies of Lieutenants Gray and Harris . The aviators had been on a crosscountry training trip . They reached Mitchel Field from Boston on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1:55 o'clock Thursday afternoon . That was the last seen of them until they passed Lavallette , a little north of the Island Beach station , shortly before 2:30 o'clock . They were in the fog then . At 2:30 o'clock they were seen by Louis G. Mitchell , commander of the Island Beach station , flying very close to the water over a heavy sea and under thick fog which threatened to close down on them every moment . Langley Vainly Awaits Them . Their departure had been telegraphed ahead to Langley Field , as is customary . As hour after hour went by , anxiety . grew among their fellow-officers at Langley , and . Colonel C. C. Culver , commandant of the Air Corps Training School there , telephoned to Mitchel Field for word of the missing men . He was told nothing had been heard from them . There was definite fear then that they had been lost , and the Coast Guard was asked to keep watch for the plane or for men who might be floating on wreckage . It was hoped that possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marshes . The fate of the plane was still a mystery until late Thursday , when the J-3 had been half an hour on her quest , Boatswain 's Mate George Worth of the Island Beach Life Saving Station saw something bobbing around in the undertow . He waded out and with difficulty drew it ashore . It was the shattered wing tip of a De Haviland plane , such as Lieutenant Harris was flying , bearing on its under surface the white star in the blue and red background that is the sign of the Army Air Service , and containing the figures 11 , believed to be the number of the plane . orth continued his search and found a piece of propeller , shattered as if by a violent dive into the water . He reported to his station and word was sent to Colonel Foulois at Mitchel Field . There was little doubt then that ' both men had been lost . Yesterday the landing gear was found , one wheel and tire Intact on the axle , the other partly torn off . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colonel Foulois said , and he felt it was a sure indication that the pilot had been blinded by the fog and flown into the water at , full speed . Officers Inspect Wreckage . Captain H. M. McClelland , post adjutant at Mitchel Field , and Major Howard Davidson , operations officer , went to the Island Beach station yesterday in an automobile and examined the wreckage . It confirmed their belief that the plane was the one flown by Lieutenant Harris , and that it had struck the water with such force that both men had probably been made helpless by the impact and dragged under with the sinking fuselage . When yesterday came and still nothing had been heard of the men , planes were prepared at Mitchel Field to take off and go south to hunt . for them . A plane was also made ready at Langley Field . But when two navy aviators flying down the New Jersey coast were turned back at Sandy Hook by the fog this effort was abandoned , as Colonel Benjamin B. D. Foulois , commandant at Mitchel Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sending pilots out on a hopeless search . Dirigible Is Forced Back . The navy air station at Lakehurst , N. J. , where the Los Angeles and the dirigible J-3 are stationed , then offered its services . Lieutenant Gray was a friend of many of the men at Lakeburst , as he had been in the lighterthan-air service of the army and had often . ' visited the station . The offer was accepted by Major Gen. J. H. commander of the Second Corps Area at Governors Island , and at 3:35 - o'clock yesterday , the J-3 , -. with Commander Maurice R. Pierce and Lieutenant R. E. Tyler , left the station and headed ? for sea . After only. : a short search , however , she was forced to put back by the fog . After the wreckage was found Colonel C. C. ? Culver of Langley Field made the following report to the War Department : " An airways plane left Mitchel Field yesterday at five minutes of two , with Lieutenant Gray and Lieutenant Harris aboard . Have heard nothing from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent alarm all the way up the coast . " Within the last ten =lutes we have heard that the wings of the wreck of an army airplane , with No. 11 on it . and two wheels , were washed up on the beach and were found by the Coast Guard near Forked River , N. J. , east of Philadelphia . Mitchel Field has sent out two planes to investigate . Am inclined to believe that No. 11 is part of the word ' Air ' painted on the ship . The number of the plane is 30-5752 Two hours later he reported : " Wrecked plane has been definitely identified as being an airways plane and was found at the Coast Guard station just below Asbury Park , N. J. " Weather Reports Lacking . Colonel Foulois said that the accident emphasized the difficulty the air services have in obtaining weather reports .
