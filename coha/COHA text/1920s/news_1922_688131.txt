txt Iron Age says : Blast furnace resumptions by steel companies are coming more rapidly thin in the first week of September . Pittsburgh , Youngstown , Cleveland , Chicago and eastern Pennsylvania report 15 furnaces started in the past week , and indications are that all the August loss of 28 furnaces will be made up by another week or ten days . Such an increase in pig iron production points to a correspondingly easier situation in the near future in respect to steel deliveries , subject to the handicap of insufficient car supply for the moving of certain rolling mill products . The embargoes announced by various railroads in the past week have had no important effect as yet on steel shipments . Ample supplies of cars are still available for coal shipments and thus far the steel industry has not been directly affected by priority rulings . One factor of uncertainty grows out of Washington ProPoRals for cooperation by coal producers in furnishing tonnages for use as required to keep prices in check . In the past week special efforts have been made to expedite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad order , the railroads are urging car works to make deliveries , since new equipment will operate for a considerable period without needing attention . Locomotive works also ? are expediting deliveries on the unusual volume of business they have booked recently . Late orders include 75 locomotives for the New York Central and 50 for the St. Louis &; San Francisco . A considerable item in the machine tool trade is a $500,000 list of shop equipment for the Missouri , Kansas dit Texas . The Steel Corporation ingot production this week is at more than 60% of capacity and several independent companies are again close to 60% , with prospects of some further increase . August steel ingot output , as expected , fell off much less from the July rate than did pig iron  --  about 25% for pig iron and only 11% for steel . As against a 35,000 , - 000-ton yearly rate in July , the August , rate was nearly 81,000,000 tons , and today it is nearer 32,000,000 tons . Buyers of steel are disposed to limit their purchases at present prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Steel Corporation 's evident purpose to continue its conservative policy . An important mill in the Chicago district has had in the past week the heaviest inquiry that ? has come to it in 18 months . However , agricultural buying in that market , which began on a moderate scale some weeks ago , has gradually fallen off as prices have advanced . Eastern bar iron manufacturers have advanced their price $3 per ton , or to ** Pittsburgh . About 500 tons of Belgian steel bars have been brought in at Philadelphia for sale at about ** Pittsburgh . Significant of an easing situation is the Ford Motor Co. ' s release this week of a portion of the steel sheets it had held up at the mills when it published its plan to close down on Sept. 16 . Connellsville coke supply increases slowly , so that pig iron output at merchant furnaces can make only a gradual gain in production . The trend of pig iron prices at Pittsburgh is still ' upward , but in other sections the advance seems to he arrested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundry grades on a basis of $32 , or $2 below the recent prevailing price . Of 8,250 tons of rails bought by Bolivia . Belgium will supply 6,000 tons . The remainder for early shipment was placed in the United States . Somewhat later upward of 12,000 tons additional will be needed . The Iron Age composite price for pig iron has advanced $1 to $31.52 per gross ton , the highest figure since the first week of 1921 . Four weeks ago it was $26.77 ; one year ago it was $19.81 per ton .
