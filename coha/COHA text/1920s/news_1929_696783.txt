txt CULLED FROM THE DRAMATIC MAILBAG Equity and Sunday Night Shows . To the Dramatic Editor : The Actors ' Equity Association , because it was born in a spirit of revolt to obtain better conditions for the actor , started out as an excellent organization , but has failed to develop . There are always additional measures and amendments needed to meet the demands that time brings about . Equity has failed to keep the stage safe for the actors . For example , why does Equity allow an actor to perform in a play when there is no bond up to cover the salary list ? Naturally the outof-work actor is willing to take a chance , but it is up to Equity to forbid him to take part in a production where no salary is put up for him . The stage hands ' union wo n't permit its members to work unless a bond is up for them . Why does n't Equity do the same for its members ? Some years ago , when there were vague rumors of Sunday night performances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they did , and the heads of Equity refused even to consider such a proposal from the managers . Now there seems to have been some influence brought to bear on the A. E. A. , and its executives are actually talking about considering or conferring on the proposition . Equity , where art thou ? Put your two feet down and say that , since the actors work eight performances a week , an extra performance must bring oneeighth extra salary . But , first and foremost , the actors should not be allowed to work on Sunday night under any circumstances . Equity owes it to its members to keep one evening a week free for them . Furthermore , in a short time managers would be making their contracts read nine performances . Equity has done a lot of good but , of recent years it has stood still : " Time changes and we change in it , " and we must keep apace and un to date . Wake up then , Equity , and continue to do the good work for which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 , 1929 . Where the West Begins . To the Dramatic Editor : Your article on the current theatre as a racket has reached me in exile . It appealed to me all the more because it aptly expressed my own reaction to this part of the country , where I have been living since June . The realization came as a shock that , all oblivious to the - elegance of Barry , the verisimilitude of Kelly and the finesse of Molnar , the wheat ripens and the country ' is fed , to the glory of the Olsons , the iliansons , the Swansons and the John- sons . A month ago the annual sauerkraut eating contest was held in Lenore Ulric 's home town , and four counties hummed with the fame of this year 's champion , who consumed four gallons of kraut in fifteen minutes , and then gave out a challenge to the press that he was ready for all corners . My casual chats with the natives , however , failed to elicit a gleam of recognition at the mention of the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , 1929 . To Aid the Worthy Shows . To the Dramatic Editor : This is not an impetuous expression of a crank or fan , but is offered more as a query . It is concerning " Murray Anderson 's Almanac , " one of the most satisfying pieces of theatre fare to which New York was treated , or will be treated , for many moons . The production , I understand , opened at Erlanger 's Theatre on Aug. 11 and played for nine weeks to a fluctuating box office  --  selling out some nights only . Quoting from your paper , under date of Oct. 11 , it appears that the show had to close , due to the fact that " the costs of operation have proved too heavy to warrant continuance . " ? What a pity ! Since it is not often that New York theatre audiences are given such de- lectable entertainment , would n't it be fine if a group of theatre enthusiasts could form a committee to pass on the merits of such a production and try to save it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Perhaps there is still a chance of reviving " Murray Anderson 's Almanac " ? for surely there are many who will agree that this " play should go on ! " MRS . A. KARMEL0 New York , Oct. 21 , 1929 . " The Criminal Code . " To the Dramatic Editor : In discussing " The Criminal Code " in a recent issue you said : " Mr. Flavin violates the spirit of ' The Criminal Code ' * * * by reaching out for pathos . " For up to this time you have been preparing to accept " The Criminal Code " as " one of the epochal plays of the century . " I am not a critic . When I enter the theatre I try to go in the spirit of a gallery god . What does this play mean to me ? I recently saw " The Criminal Code " in New York . I left the theatre thinking that not only is it a great play , but it is " the epochal play of the century .
