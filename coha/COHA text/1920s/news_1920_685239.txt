txt In this beautiful little Italian city , swept by soft Mediterranean winds , the stage is set for the beginning tomorrow of the InterAllied Conference . The Premiers will sit in the beautiful Villa pevachan . Despite the peaceruiness or the surroundings a'distinct spirit of discord is observed in the preliminaries . Premiers Lloyd George , Nitti and Millerand had a meeting this morning to arrange the conference program , but the only announcement mace was that the heads of the Allied Governments had pledged themselves not to talk to newspapermen . This vote was taken on the insistence of Mr. Lloyd George . The French announced last night that the first subject to be discussed would be the Franco-Anglo-German imbroglio . Today the British say that the first subject will be the Turkish treaty . Perhaps neither announcement will prove to be correct . I learn that M. Millerand told Mr. Lloyd George that the Premiers had better begin by settling matters of policy rather than treaty terms , pointing out that it was useless to decide on the words of the Turkish treaty unless there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies ' relations to Germany and remarking that differences of policy had made enough trouble already . France and England are at loggerheads on many points of the Turkish situation , especially as to the future of Constantinople , and it is probable that the first two days of the conference will bring no definitely announced results , but will be devoted to bringing the Premiers to a general agreement  --  a task which some critics think should have been accomplished before they came to San Remo . The British are disposed to regard the recent note sent to Berlin , announcing that the Allies would suspend the operation of plans for economic restoration if Germany did not disarm , as disposing of one troublesome question . The French are disposed to doubt the value of purely economic measures against Germany and want additional guarantees . This subject is full of dynamite , as shown by the French occupation of Frankfort , &c.,; and it must be remembered that the French have reserved freedom of action in case of ultimate need . The Premiers will hold two sessions daily . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels . The Italians have the Hotel des AngIals , the English the Hotel Royal , and the French the Hotel Savoie . The Belgians and Greeks will arrive tomorrow . A small Japanese delegation came tonight . Four correspondents are the only Americans who are here for the conference . Robert Underwood Johnson , the new American Ambassador to Rome , arrived unexpectedly last night . He asks me to say that he has no connection with the Peace Conference , and is here because the railroad strike prevented his going to Rome by the usual route . He says he has conferred with none of the Premiers and expects to leave for Rome tonight , before which he will pay his respects to Premier Nitti . This , then , is the first allied conference near which there has not been an American Ambassador to keep his Government in touch with developmeAta . On account of other causes rather than the absence of any American , many recommendations of President Wilson probably will not be followed by the Premiers in reaching their decisions . Premier Nitti is an ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is either a state of war or a state e ' peace , he wants Europe in a state of peace .

Jugoslays Are Not Represented . Special Cable to Tux Dim Yoen PARIS , April ** special correspondent of the Temps at San Remo telegraphs this evening that preliminary conferences have taken place today between the allied Premiers . M. Millerand called on Mr. Lloyd George at 9 o'clock , and at 11 o'clock the two Premiers visited Signor Nitti to arrange the program of the conference .

The news has reached Paris from Belgrade that M. Pachitch , the Serbian delegate to the Peace Conference , is seriously ill ; but whether his illness is real or of a diplomatic nature is uncertain . Policy of Secrecy Causes Dismay . By G. A. DEBRIS . Copyright , 1920 , by The New York ? Times Company . Special Cable to Tim Nrw Your TIMES . SAN RESIO , April ** Peace Conference will open tomorrow in the Villa Devachan . I regret to say that the " Big Three " began their deliberations by deciding to issue no information to the press beyond a daily official bulletin . Some scores of newspaper correspondents who arrived yesterday from far-distant parts of Europe , sundry of them with official encouragement , have received this statement with dismay . It is not the first time the Peace Conference has attempted to convert itself into a secret junta , but circumstances here are much less favorable to such a policy than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unanimous strike of the British and American press produced a rapid change of mind in the council chamber . It is to be hoped , therefore , that other voices will now make themselved heard . Assuredly Information will leak out , but it will be colored by personal or national motives and will be worse than dead silence . It seems impossible that on reflection the three Premiers should maintain a decree so mistaken . Turkish Treaty the First Topic . SAN REMO , April 18 ( Associated Press ) . ? Questions in connection with the peace treaty with Turkey will comprise the first business to be taken up by the Supreme Council of the Allies at its first formal session here tomorrow . This was decided upon at a conference today in the Villa Duvashan , where the sessions are to be held , attended by Premiers Nitti , Lloyd George and Millerand , for the arrangement of the official procedure , with the Premiers Vittorio Scialoia , the Foreign Minister of Italy ; Earl Curzon , the British Foreign Secretary , and General Berthelot , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communiques should be issued , as upon the occasion of previous sessions of the Council . The Prime Ministers of the three great powers  --  Nitti , Millerand and Lloyd George  --  have expressed very decided regret that the United States Government is taking no part in what is regarded as one of the final acts of the Peace Conference . So far as it can be gathered , the feeling here is that the absence of America is only temporary and that ' the reasons for her present abstention are likely to disappear . For the present , however , the Prime Ministers , Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors of France , Great Britain , Italy , Japan , Belgium and Greece at the meeting are preoccupied with problems particularly affecting themselves , and there is no disposition to dwell unduly upon the lack of American participation . The first meeting of the conferees will he opened at 1 0 : 30 o'clock tomorrow morning . The decision to make the Turkish treaty the first business of the conference was not unexpected , as there appears to be general agreement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for the calling of the conference , it might as well be taken up at the very beginning . It is surrounded by many perplexities , among them naval and military questions , such as the manner of policing the Dardanelles , the form of control to be set up in Constantinople , the delimitation of the boundaries of Thrace and Armenia and the question of the Greek position in Smyrna . Other subjects which have not been mentioned yet , but which will be brought before the Council before its sessions close , are the condition of international exchange and the position in which Italian industry has been placed by lack of coal . The Hungarian treaty wilt have to be passed upon finally , with the prospect that the present . Hungarian Government may refuse to sign it . In addition , there is the vastly important question , of compelling Germany to fulfill the Treaty of Versailles , regarding which an early declaration by the conference is expected . Sessions will be held mornings and afternoons , with the possibility that evening meetings also may be arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the sessions. while Premier Venizelos for Greece and For . eign Minister Hymans for Belgium , win be admitted during discussions concerning questions affecting their nationals . The Jugoslays are not represented here , and it appears . doubtful if the Adriatic question will . be taken up .
