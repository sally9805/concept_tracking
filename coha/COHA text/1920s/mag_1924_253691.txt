" The best laid schemes o ' mice and men . . . " - both Premiers Ramsay MacDonald and Edouard Herriot were evidently conscious of these simple words of Poet Burns . <P> Premier Herriot of France rushed to Britain ( TIME , June 30 ) ; then rushed from Britain to Belgium ( TIME , July 7 ) ; then from Belgium to France , where he promptly got into trouble with the Parliament ( TIME , July 14 ) . <P> As Premier MacDonald 's notes of invitation to the Premiers ' Conference in London , addressed to the interested Powers , were mainly responsible for Premier Herriot 's predicament , their author announced last week that he was off to Paris to aid his stricken colleague . <P> Arriving with a cold and a headache in the gay Capital of France , which received him most ungaily , he proceeded to defend his confrre . The two Premiers had a heart-to-heart talk . After various conferences , Mr. MacDonald was seen with a wan smile , for his exertions on behalf of Edouard had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Premier was a magician- " we can not wave a wand and accomplish miracles . " But he declared that they were both , substantially , in agreement . <P> The substance of that agreement was a virtual compromise . Premier MacDonald , on his own initiative , had suggested to the invites of the Premiers ' Conference a scheme to make the Permanent Court of International Justice ultimately responsible for deciding possible default by Germany under the Experts ' Plan . <P> However , M. Herriot 's Opposition , and , it was feared , some of the Government parties , saw in the British Premier 's scheme the snapping of a vital thread which enabled France to control reparations questions through the Reparations Commission ( TIME , July 14 ) . The Premier was forced to see the logic of this argument , and in order to clear the matter up the two Premiers decided : <P> 1 ) To confirm the powers of the Reparations Commission specifically with regard to its power to declare Germany in default . <P> 2 ) To invite , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official member of the Reparations Commission , whose chief duty will be to decide on German default under the Experts ' Plan . Failing this , it was decided to invite an American to act as supervisory agent of reparations , and the name of Owen D. Young was put forward . <P> Back again in London , Premier MacDonal 'd unfolded his sad tale to the House of Commons : " An unfortunate situation having arisen in Paris which threatened to destroy the work done to arrange for the interallied conference on application of the Experts ' Reports , I went to Paris to try to remove it . " <P> The remainder of his speech was corroborative of what has been above described . He ended : " Perhaps I may be allowed to add a personal note to express gratitude for the very cordial way in which I , as head of the British Government , was received by all parties during my short stay in Paris . " <P> Ex-Premiers Baldwin , George and Asquith promised the Premier a hot debate on his trip to Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herriot received an almost unanimous vote of confidence from the Senate , in connection with the Premiers ' Conference .
