txt Jack Dempsey successfully defended the heavyweight boxing championship at Madison Square Garden last night when he knocked out Bill Brennan in the twelfth round of a scheduled fifteenround bout . The end came after 1 minute and 67 seconds of fighting in the twelfth round , and terminated one of the most vicious and closely contested heavyweight bouts ever seen . It was a right hook delivered with great force to Brennan 's body just beneath the heart that started Brennan on his way to defeat . As ' he doubled over and winced with pain Dempsey quickly stepped in and whipped a well-directed left hook , delivered with all the power of his massive shoulders , into Brennan 's right side . The challenger dropped to his hands and knees . As Referee Haukop began to toll off the fatal ten seconds , Brennan writhed in agony and strove gamely to regain his feet , but it was beyond human possibility . At the count of seven it looked as if he might succeed in dragging himself up on his tottering legs , but he slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regains Feet Too Late . Just as Referee Haukop 's right arm fell for the tenth time Brennan regained his feet , but he had been counted out , and as Dempsey made as if to step in to deliver another crushing blow the referee stepped between the men , waving Dempsey back to his corner and grabbing Brennan by his arm to lead him to his corner . For a moment Dempsey did not seem to realize that Brennan had been counted out and there were many in the vast throng of 15,000 that filled the Garden to overflowing who were of the opinion , not that a knockout had been scored , hut that Referee Haukop had stopped the bout because of Brennan 's helpless condition . Such was not the case , however , Haukop officially announced to those at the ringside that Brennan had been counted out . It was a fitting climax to a bout that had been replete with sensational events and surprises . More than once during the first eleven rounds it looked as if the challenger might succeed in driving home a crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of Dempsey up to the golden heavyweight throne . As early as the second round Brennan proved that he was not to be the mark or " set-up " that so many had expected . In that round Brennen whipped a right uppercut to Dempsey 's jaw that dazed the champion . It was evident to all present that Jack had been jarred clear to his heels . He was groggy and his legs  --  one of his biggest assets In the other fights  --  wobbled . It looked for a moment as if he would go crashing to the floor and be counted out . Hrennan Misses Chance . Brennan seems equally surprised . He stepped back to look the champion over . Bill could hardly believe his eyes . He did not seem able to grasp . the fact that he had the champion in a dengerous way . He did not seem to hear the knocking of opportunity . That brief hesitation on his part enabled Dempsey to regain his scattered senses . Had Brennan stepped in quickly and delivered some ? of his rights and lefts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely different . He might have succeeded in realizing his long cherished ambition to be heavyweight champion of the world . The oversight cost him dearly . Dempsey quickly stepped into a clinch and when the referee finally succeeded in prying him loose he had so far recovered that he was able to fight back and was giving Brennan as good as he received when the bell sounded and ended the round . Thereafter Dempsey did not seem to be himself . He did not fight the . way he did against Jess Willard at ' Toledo nor the way he battled Billy . Miske at Benton harbor . There was nothing about his carriage in the ring nor his general actions to indicate the energy and youthful vim and vigor that have generally been such a prominent feature of his battles . Possibly it was that terrific uppercut to the jaw that he suffered in the second round that robbed him of much of his strength . Whatever the cause , certain it was that the Dempsey of the next two rounds was not the Dempsey who has been accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed worried . Brennan 's long slinging left bothered him no little . The champion seemed at sea as to how to avoid it/ and , try as he did , he was unable to drive his powerful rights and lefts to a vital spot . He seemed to realize how futile these offorts were and he resorted to swinging . Champion Not Himself . Dempsey 's judgment of distance , too , was verY poor . As he set himself to unleash his bone-crushing right he did lot appear sure of himself . The old ; onfidence which always ? accompanied aim in the ring seemed missing . The . result was that frequently when he let his punches go he missed his mark by wide margins . On the other hand . Brennan was fighting the best fight of his career . There was nothing about him Indicating that even remotely did he entertain any fear of the champion . True , he was cautious , but that was absolutely necessary . He had fought Dempsey before out in Milwaukee . in February of 1918 , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those padded mitts there lurked a world of power that could spell disaster for any jaw or any ribs they came in contact with . The challenger was content to jab with his left and wait for openings in Dempsey 's defense through which to crash a right cross or right uppercut . Several times during the early rounds he drove home , and Dempsey was forced to clinch and hold to protect himself . During these rounds the crowd was continually cheering Brennan on In his efforts . Crowd Is With Brennan . No cheers for Dempsey were heard . It was evident that the challenger carried the bulk of the crowd 's favor and support . This , too , apparently had a disconcerting effect on Dempsey. who seemed to realize that he was unpopular with the majority or at least with the noisier of those present . It was not ' until the fifth round that Dempsey showed the form that usually features his ring work . Whereas up until that time he had been woefully slow on his feet and had not stepped around his opponent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancing in and out and around Brennan . In this way he tried ' to feint Brennan into position for him to crash in a blow that would decisively end the proceedings , but Brennan was not yet ready to relinquish all hope of scaling the pugilistic heights . He was not to be led Into the mistake of laying aside his defense . He kept his jaw well covered and . fighting in a crouching position , his body was well out of the range of Dempsey 's wicked leads . Through the sixth and seventh rounds as well Brennan fought the champion to a standstill . Up to the eighth round he had given slightly more than he had received when everything was weighed in the balance . Big Lights Go Out in Eighth . Just as the bell rang at the start of the eighth round one of the two largest of the six lights that hung over the ring went . out and from far up in the distant regions of the top gallery a voice called out " Good night , Brennan . " Evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dempsey came out of his corner with something akin to a rush and quickly drove a right uppercut. to Brennan 's body . He followed this with a straight right to his rival 's ribs , and to those at the ringside it seemed that the champion was preparing the challenger for the finish . Brennan rocked under the force of the blow , but he was far from being on the verge of a knockout . He ately made Dempsey give ground by cutting loose a vicious right swing that landed on the back of Dempsey 's neck . did no damage . but served the purI Pose of showing Dempsey that Brennan was still strong . After a bria spell of infighting , in which the blows landed were about equally divided , Dempsey landed a blancing blow that slid along Brennan 's jaw . Had the blow landed flush on the " button " Brennan would have taken a trip into the land of dreams . Even as it - was Brennan appeared to be somewhat groggy . He quickly fell into a clinch and his great recuperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather the threatened storm . When the bell sounded he was fighting Dempsey in the champion 's own corner and , by a strange coincidence , the light that had been out during the round suddenly burst forth in all its brightness. , Brennan Surprises Dempsey . Again Brennan came back strongly in the ninth round , and there was nothing to indicate that he felt any ill effects from what had happened in the previous session . His return to strength surprised Dempsey , and when Brennan showed a willingness to trade blows with him the champion was little short of astounded . This was apparent by - the way Dempsey quickly stepped back and gave ground after the first rapid exchange of blows . Brennan followed him across the ring and more infighting took place . While some solid blows were exchanged they had little telling effect , and the round ended with both boxers tired from their exertions . It was in the tenth round that it became apparent that Brennan could scarcely hope to last the full fifteen rounds . The round was ushered in by both boxers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed a short right hook on Bill 's jaw . A left hook to the mouth followed , causing the blood to spurt from Brennan 's split lips . As they went into a clinch Brennan swung his right to Dempsey 's left ear . Whether this cut the champion 's ear lobe or whether Brennan 's head collided with the spot could not be definitely decided , but the blood was gushing down the side of Dempsey 's jaw and under the ear . Dempsey almost threw eau ' tion to the winds . He had been stung and was fighting mad . He rushed 1Brennan and drove In a series of short rights and lefts to the body . Brennan 's knees sagged but he pitched forward into the clinch and was able to last out ' the round . He came back strong in the eleventh but it was apparent his , blows lacked steam . ' His defense , however , kept Dempsey from applying the finishing touches . Champion 's Swing Wild . At the start of the twelfth it was apparent that Dempsey was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed one of the wildest right swings ho has been guilty of unleashing since he first loomed up as a championship possibility about ' two and a half years ago . Ordinarily Dempsey hooks his punches . It is seldom that he swings them , but by the time the twelfth round had been reached he seemed to have decided that the only way to batter Brennan into submission was by swinging , in the hope that  --  the power of these swings , ? even if partially blocked , would still be sufficient to lay low the game and determined man in front of him . After Brennan had scored . a right to Dempsey 's ear , the champion retaliated with a left to Brennan 's face . A clinch followed . As they came out of the clinch Dempsey sunk his right into Brennan 's body just under the heart . The challenger 's legs sagged at the knees and his body bent over . Then followed ' the left to ' Brennan 's ribs that finished one of the greatest heavyweight bouts that - have ever been seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battery of cameras was set up in the ring to take the pictures of the rival heavyweights . Brennan was the first to enter the ring , clad in his green boxing trunks and a red sweater . He took his place in the southeast corner . He was followed two minutes later by the champion . Dempsey wore light silk boxing trunks and had only a bath towel draped over his powerful , muscled shoulders . Dempsey was accompanied by his manager , Jack Kearns , and Harry Neary . Brennan was accompanied by his manager , Leo Flynn , and Dia . Dollin gs . After the fighters had been introduced . stills and motion pictureawere taken of them , their managers and the referee . Joe Humphries showed the diamondstudded belt that Tex Rickard will present to the winner and which is emblematic of the world 's heavyweight championship . He announced it was to be defended every six months . The belt will become the personal property of the man winning it three times . The first real move in connection with the bout itself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon in accordance with the provisions of the Walker Law . In the presence of Tex Rickard , the rival managers . representatives of the Boxing Commission and some newspaper men . Dempsey and Brennen stepped upon the scales . Dempsey weighed 188U pounds and Brennan 197 . This was 3e.e pounds more than Dempsey weighed when he fought Billy Miske at Benton Harbor , Mich , on Labor Day . At that time it was announced Dempsey weighed 187 , but the champion afterwards declared that a mistake had been made and that he really tipped the beam at 185 . He weighed 187 when be fought Jean Willard and won the heavyweight championship of the world at Toledo on July 4 , 1919 . Dempsey Near Usual Weight . The weights proved that both men had trained faithfully for the fight . Dempsey was within a few pounds of the weight at which he has done all of his fighting since he burst forth from obscurity three years ago and launched the campaign that finally landed him on the heavyweight throne with the crown jauntily tilted thwart his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekbones and the clear look in his deep-set eyes proved that Dempsey had worked and worked ' hard to attain that perfection of condition which had stood him in such good stead in all of his previous bouts . Brennan . on the other hand . was several pounds under what he usually weighs . Most of the challenger 's fighting had been done with him weighing 200 or 201 . When he entered the ring to engage in the first chance at the title he had ever had in his hectic ring career he did not carey a pound of surplus weight . He was trained to the minute . A SURPRISE TO DEMPSEY. champion Says He Found Brennan Tougher Than He Expected . " Brennan was tougher than I expected , " said Dempsey after the battle . " He stood up under my bloers longer than I thought he could . Brennan 's blows did n't hurt me at any time during the bout , but I found him a hard man to hit properly and a tough man for taking punishment . I thought I could finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The champion 's manager was more communicative than the titleholder . " It was n't a tough bout in the strict sense of the word , " . said Manager Kearns , as he stepped from the ring in the wake of the champion , clasping tightly in his two hands the belt which had just been presented to Dempsey by Announcer . Toe Humphries on behalf of Promoter Tex Rickard : " The champion was always the master and took his time . None of Brennan 's blows hurt Dempsey , despite the fact that Dempsey 's left ear was split and his lower lip badly cut . These wounds made the champion bleed badly , but did not hurt him to any great extent . " Dempsey was not in the best of condition . regardless of the result . He trained too hard and was too finely drawn to be at his best . For this reason the champion boxed below his standard . Then , too , Brennan hung on and held , every chance he got , and this also affected the bout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coast . The champion and I are going out there and will re ' main there until next March , ! when Dempsey will come East for his bout against Jess Willard at the Garden March 17 . " BRENNAN FEELS VINDICATED . Pleased at Lasting So Long , but Not Satisfied With Result . " I feel I have vindicated myself . " said Brennan when seen in his dressing room as his handlers were removing the marks of battle . " I fought longer against Dempsey than any other man and proved conclusively my ability to stay longer than six rounds . " I am not satisfied with the result of the bout . I thought I had beaten the referee 's count and was surprised when he motioned me to my corner . I wanted to continue and believe I could have proceeded with the bout and lasted until the finish . I felt all right then ' and I feel fine now . " I just forgot to get out of the way of one of Dempsey 's rights , " said Brennan with a laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most and what punch lie thought started him on the downward grade . Pointing to a spot tinder his heart , Brennan again laughed as he reiterated the statement . Becoming serious again , Brennan continued : " 1 think I am entitled to another match and intend to campaign for a return bout . I am not . satisfied that Dempsey is my superior . I know I had him going in the second round , but I could not follow up the advantage . His blows did not hurt me except the punches to the stomach , which carried plenty of steam . In the twelfth round a right to the stomach- and a left which followed quickly were the hardest blows I felt . " Leo P. Flynn declared that even in the defeat for his heavyweight there was a measure of triumph . " We gave him a fight , did n't we ? he exclaimed after the bout . " I am satisfied in this respect that we lasted longer than anybody expected we would . and that means a lot , do n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best heavyweight in the world excepting possibly Dempsey himself . And at that I do n't think Dempsey is the wonderful boxer they say he is . Nobody gave Brennan a chance against him tonight , yet Bill went in and gave him the fight et his life and actually had him going in the second round . I think we are entitled to another bout and I expect to seek one after Bill has four or five more battles under his belt . "
