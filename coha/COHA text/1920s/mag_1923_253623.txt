Frank A. Vanderlip , graduate of a western college , speaking before the alumni of a western university , gave it as his unbiased opinion that western college men were superior to eastern college men " both in character and in ability to work . " And everyone was pleased . From the point of view of the young western college men who have sold Mr. Vanderlip bonds and filed his tax returns the statement is both interesting and sound . From the point of view of the alumni of Yale and Harvard who have filled similar positions the statement is interesting but quite unaccountably wrong . The rest of the world will admire the courage of a man who dares to generalize .
