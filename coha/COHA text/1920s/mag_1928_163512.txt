North of Milwaukee are two Wisconsin counties , Sheboygan and Manitowoc , and two ambitious German-born brothers , Charles S. Voight and Edward Voight . The two counties fit together nicely into one judicial circuit . The full-grown Brothers Voight can not , however , be fitted together into the single circuit judgeship . So , since both Brothers Voight are determined to be circuit judge , political fratricide impends . Last fortnight bold Brother Edward Voight was reminding Sheboyganders and Manitowocians how he served five terms ( 1917-27 ) in the U. S. House of Representatives , ever faithful to La Follettism . Brother Charles S. Voight , on the other hand , happily reminded people that La Follettism once meant Pacifism , and perhaps worse ; that he , Charles S. Voight , helped sell Liberty Bonds , helped the local draft board , and spoke like a patriot " even in the German language . " <P> Said cheerful Charles Voight : " For the life of me , I ca n't see how any man who served in the War can vote for Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will let my record speak for itself and will not make a fight . . . unless forced to do so . " <P> In trying to decide between the Brothers Voight , Wisconsin voters were at least luckier than West Virginians . Wisconsin 's Voights are easily distinguishable one from another , Charles 's face being longer and plainer than handsome , smiling Edward 's . West Virginia has two Sharp brothers in politics and they are identical twins . Summers H. Sharp , circuit judge at Marlinton , W. Va. , often visits Charleston , the capital , where George Sharp is Secretary of State . When both are in town at once , people rub their eyes and Negroes get the " jim-jams . " George Sharp has been mentioned as a gubernatorial candidate and West Virginians say that , should he choose to run , he could ( with Summers Sharp 's help ) campaign in two parts of the State at once , and , if elected , attend the executive office only half the time .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
