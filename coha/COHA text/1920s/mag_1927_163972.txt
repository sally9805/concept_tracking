WAR BIRDS-Diary of an Unknown Aviator-Doran ( $3.50 ) . * A glossy finish is not among this chronicle 's properties . Not for effect but for grim , humorous , human record , and probably for relief , did the author set down in airmen 's vernacular daily events and sensations from the day he sailed from Halifax to the eve of his death behind Germany 's lines . Nor is it a philosopher 's diary , but the blunt journal of a rather tough , inarticulate " war bird . " He " laughs off " the emotion stirred in him by a full moon at sea , by guessing he needs " a little loving " and wondering about the trained nurses aboard . He records the deaths of comrades with as little flourish as he accords their myriad fly-by-night amours . " If these boys can fly two-bladers like they can fly four-posters there 'll be a shortage of Huns before long . " The irony of Death in a British training camp bears down heavily . Life , however , is simple : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped . It is not quite accurate to call the author unknown . Some of the men he names by name survived-piano-playing Larry Callahan of Chicago , for example ; Violinist Albert Spalding ; one-armed Alan Winslow ; husky Dr. " Hash " Gile of Princeton and New York . They will applaud the terse descriptions of air action , heavily salted with realism and cynicism . They will admire Clayton Knight 's sketches of havoc-ridden skies . They will remember the writer as they remember other men in his pages-big " Ros " Fuller , Clarence Fry , John Goad , " Hobey " Baker , " Micky " Mannock , superb Major Bishop ( and his wife ) and Pilot Springs , who flew with milk of magnesia in one pocket , gin in the other . <P> Many citizens were agog when War Birds first came among them . Mothers , sisters , wives-but most of all , neighbors-of the young men who years ago flew in France , affected surprise and concern upon discovering that it was not , after all , a very " nice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to this writer , that the best talisman for an airman was " a garter taken from the left leg of a virgin in the dark of the moon . " <P> - Published aerially by Liberty ( weekly ) last year .
