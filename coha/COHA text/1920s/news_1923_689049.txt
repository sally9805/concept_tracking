txt The $17,340,000 equipment trust certificates which the Interstate Commerce Commission has just authorized the New/York Central to issue may very likely be the last bond financing on the part of the company before a large additional issue of stock is offered shareholders . With Central solidly on a 75- basis , its earnings on the up-grade , its position solidified by gradual acquisition of minority shares of subsidiaries . there is no reason why a large stock financing operation should not be well received . The example of American Telephone has shown that a $100,000,000 issue of stock can be successfully marketed . It is hardly likely that Central would go into the market for a smaller amount , although an issue of $25,000,000 or $50,000,000 has been mentioned on the Street . Such a sum would not permit Central to call its $100,000,000 debentures and it is likely that the management would want to kill two birds with one stone , increasing outstanding capital stock directly by a new issue and indirectly through conversions . Assurance that Union Pacific and other large Central stockholders would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file of shareholders . A new stock issue should be welcome to Union Pacific , permitting it to average down to cost of its holdings , $125 a share for $21,000,000 stock . Obviously an advance in the market for Central stock will be necessary to permit a stock issue or to induce bond conversions in any quantity . With the stock at 103 there is too narrow a margin to permit the sale of stock at par . The bonds now sell above the stock so that there is no incentive to convert . Not until the stock sells above 115% will it be profitable to bondholders to convert their holdings instead of selling their bonds and buying stock in the market . The action of Central 's directors in Increasing the dividend rate was taken only after prolonged consideration . It is safe to say that it was not taken merely to add $5,000,000 a year to dividend requirements but was a logical step in a well-considered plan to facilitate future financing and the better balancing of the road 's capital structure . Viewed in this light the dividend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial interests in the soundness of the business situation and the future of the rails in the stock market .
