txt The Republican Legislature was condemned by Governor Smith today for Its failure to observe the spirit of the Home Rule law where legislation affecting the property and affairs of the city of New York is concerned . New York City , the Governor said , had been singled out by the Republican lawmakers from rural sections of the State as an easy mark for mandatory legislation which they would not think of passing against any of the up-State cities . The Governors denunciation of the course pursued by Republican legislators was made in the course of public hearings before him today on a score of bills , a majority of which provided for salary increases , payable by New York City and constituting part of a concerted raid on the city treasury by means of measures sponsored for the most part by Democratic Senators and Assemblymen from the city . The Republicans , being in control of both branches of the legislative body , had it within their power to protect the city against these forays , but utterly failed to do so , a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally objected being let out of committee and rushed to final passage during the closing hours of the legislative session . Court Bill Stirs Governor . While in many instances the measires providing for salary boosts were not literally in conflict with the Home Rule law , because of exemptions forced into that statute before it could receive a majority in the Legislature which enacted it , the Governor pointed out that , almost without exception , the bills were in conflict with the spirit of the Home Rule amendment to the Constitution and were designed to obtain legislative action on questions which should have been put up to the New York City Administration . The Governor voiced his views while a bill designed to divide the Seventh Municipal Court District on the upper west side so as to carve out a new district from which a negro could be elected to the Municipal Court bench was under discussion . The bill happened to be sponsored by a Republican , Assemblyman , Abraham Grenthal , of the Ni - ' h ( Manhattan ) District , wh had brought with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by Pope Billups , a former member of the Assembly . Mr. Billups argued that a representative of his race was entitled to a place on the bench of the poor man 's court and urged as a further reason for dividi - ; the district the great congesticn of the court calendar . " We are making no bones about it , " lie said . " We are f : this bill because it will open the way for a colored lawyer to be elected a Justice of the Municipal Court . Sign this bill , Governor , and you will show the whole country that you are a man whose decisions are not colored by racial prejudice . " " I am sorry , " the Governor said , " that I can not , in considering this bill , approach it from your viewpoint . My objection to this sort of legislation is doe to the fact that it imposes mandatory expenses on the city not approved by the city authorities . The man from Ontario and Jefferson Counties up-State voted for this bill over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt , " continued the Governor , " that the Legislature is playing ball with the Municipal Court in New York City . They knocked out a bill providing for a scientific reorganization of that tribunal with a Chief Justice who would have been equipped with powers to cure a situation like the one that is advanced here as a pretext for dividing the Seventh Municipal Court District and to place the administration of this important court on a sound basis . " Then they send me down a bill like this . " Negro Urges Approval . Mr. Billups. who was persistent , declared that there were Isom 200 to 250 cases on the calendar daily in the Seventh District Municipal Court and that it was more difficult to get a trial there than before the Supreme Court . There was a population of 458,000 within the boundary of the district , he said , whereas the average population of Municipal Court districts was 180.000 . Assistant Corporation Counsel Walter Caughlan told the Governor that the City Administration opposed the measure as imposing an unnecessary expense on - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conflict with the home rule principle . The Governor plainly indicated that he would veto the bill , as he has done with similar measures . The Governor returned to the attack on the Republicans a little later when a bill providing for the abandonment of the District Court and the creation of a central Municipal Court for the Borough of Brooklyn came up . This , too , was opposed by the Walker Ad- ministration . Joseph S. Byrne , Chairman of the Courts Committee of the Brooklyn Civic Council , urged the Governor to approve the bill and the Brooklyn Chaiaber of Commerce also had a spokesman in its support . " Go to the City Hall . " The Governor spoke with heat in showing that he would not approve the bill . " If you want this legislation , go to the City Hall and get the City Administration to approve the scheme , " he exclaimed . " That 's the way to get it through  --  get the city to send a bill up with its endorsement . I do not see why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of New York . They would not think of doing it against Buffalo , Rochester , Syracuse or any other city than New York . Sandwiched in between bills providing for salary boosts were a number of retirement and pension bills affecting New York City employes , who had sent Deputy Controller Frank J. Prial to the Capitol as their spokesman . Mr. Prial is head of the Civil Service Employes ' Forum . All the measures were objected to by ' Stewart Browne , representing the United Real Estate Owners ' Association , as unnecessary and inflicting unwarranted burdens on the taxpayers ; He even questioned whether the bills had been properly put through the Legislature . One of the series would place as basis for retirement pay the salary of the last five instead of the last ten years of service . Another would cut down the age of retirement from sixty yearn to fifty-five years . Would Cost City $60,000,000 . This last was objected to by Franklin B. Holmes , director of the State employes ' retirement system , as one that would " rip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! repose obligations aggregating $60,000,000 on the City of New York , " for the purpose of making it possible to pay one or two $25,000 pensions . " Mr. Holmes said the bill was legislation introduced for the benefit of one , possibly two , men in the city service . R. E. of the Citizens ' Union also opposed the bill . The Governor asked Mr. Holmes if he favored the provision basing retirement pay on the salary of the last five years , pointing out that most of the big salary increases had occurred during that period . Deputy Controller Prial disputed many of the statements made by Mr. Holmes , especially that it would obligate the city to the payment of $60 , - 000,000 to reduce the retirement age to 55 years . He said the city had showed that it was prepared to accept the legislation by appropriating $580,000 to meet the cost . The municipal Assembly had passed the retirement bills but the Court of Appeals had invalidated the acts on the ground that county employes , not coming under the Home Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assistant Corporation Counsel CaughIan told the Governor the city authorities did not object to the bills , but the Governor tonight had not decided whether to approve or veto them . Undecided on Sewage Disposal . He is undecided also with regard to the Dunnigan bill , which would authorize the State to transfer to the city a , section of Wards Island for the erection of a sewage disposal plant . This measure was opposed by Dr. C. Floyd Haviland , head of the State Hospital Commission , who said it would make necessary the transfer of 6,800 resident patients at the Wards Island State Hospital for thelInsane and he had nowhere to put them . " Do you want me to turn them loose in the streets of the city ? " Dr. Haviland asked . The Governor professed to be in a quandary . On one hand , lie said , was the problem of how to dispose of enough patients to call for the construction of two new State Hospitals . On the other , the city was confronted with a pressing problem in connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present threatened to contaminate both the East and Harlem Rivera . It is the contention of the city authorities that the sewage disposal plant will be so modern and non-odorous-as not to interfere with the retention of the State Hospital , but Dr. Haviland would not hear of this . " I have vetoed this bill before on other grounds  --  I wanted to make a park of Ward Island , " the Governor said . " Now we will have to think It over . " Salary increases for County Judge , Surrogate and District Attorney of Queens County to $22,500 for the former two officials and to $20,000 for the last and involving various employes in the courts and the prosecutor 's office as well ; increases for county detectives in Queens , for the Sheriff of New York County and the District Attorney of Kings County also appeared on the Governor 's schedule . No one appeared for or against the last two named . Surrogate Noble of Queens appeared in favor of the salary boosts for officials in Dis own county and argued so warmly that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed .
