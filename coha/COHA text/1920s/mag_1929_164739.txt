Beaverishness on a gigantic scale was manifest last week when President Hoover , energetic engineer , unfolded at Cincinnati his administration 's plan for developing U. S. inland waterways into one vast closeknit system of cheap transportation . The same instinct which sets him to building toy dams and clearing out rock-choked channels in tiny mountain streams moved him to advocate a river improvement policy which will cost approximately a billion dollars . <P> The occasion for this declaration of policy was the completion of the canalization of the Ohio River from Pittsburgh , Pa. , to Cairo , Ill. ( 967 mi . ) . Fifty wicket locks now maintain a nine-foot all-year channel down this historic stream , first traversed ( 1669 ) by Explorer La Salle , admired by Surveyor George Washington , developed by President James Monroe . Into its brown waters have been poured $150,000,000 to permit stumpy little tugs to haul 50 million tons of coal , iron , gravel and sand on steel barges back and forth each year . <P> The Hoover program : 1 ) . A consolidation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patchwork of disconnected local improvements which has in the past been the sink for hundreds of millions of public money . " <P> 2 ) . Development of the Mississippi as the north-south trunk line and the " modernization " of its tributaries , to create a 9,000-mi. water transportation system in the heart of the U. S. Of this , 3,800 mi. now have a channel six feet deep or better , leaving 5,000 mi. for U. S. development Chief tributaries for improvement : Illinois ( Chicago-to-the-Gulf route ) , Missouri ( high into the wheat country ) , Arkansas ( west to the oil fields ) , Tennessee ( through the coal lands ) . Time limit : five years . <P> 3 ) . Great Lakes-St . Lawrence seaway " whenever our Canadian friends have overcome those difficulties that lie in the path . " Time : ten years . Cost : " After we have disposed of the electrical power , we could contract the entire construction for less than $200,000,000 divided between the two Governments . " <P> 4 ) . Channel improvements in the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Addition of 1,000 mi. to the existing 746 mi. of intracoastal canals . Time : less than ten years . <P> 6 ) . Re-examination of the Mississippi Flood Control Plan , with possible readjustments of floodways below the Arkansas . <P> 7 ) . " Unceasing development of our harbors and the littoral waterways . " <P> These combined projects equal about three Panama Canals . But , warned President Hoover , their completion " is not the dream of the visionaries-it is the march of the Nation . " To their construction he pledged himself " with all the expedition which sound engineering will permit . " <P> Costs . Today the U. S. is spending $50,000,000 per year on river and harbor development , $35,000,000 on flood control . President Hoover predicted that his program could be undertaken and carried through by the expenditure of only an additional $10,000,000 per year - or $20,000,000 if the Great Lakes-St . Lawrence seaway were included .
