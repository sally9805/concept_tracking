txt A BONUS FOR SOLDIERS ? Views on the Proposal of Men Who Served In the War . To the Editor of The New York Times : I was very much gratified , in reading your editorial article of Feb. 28 , entitled " Billions in Bonuses , " to see that there was one newspaper that had enough backbone to present this matter in the way that all true patriotic veterans see it . By way of explaining my great interest , I might say that I am willing to stack cards with any one who takes exception to this letter , by saying that I served in a unit in all the American offensives on the front lines ; that this unit made an enviable record both in the training camps and on the front as ' artillerymen , ' the said unit being composed of volunteers before any draft boards were created , and recruited by myself . Knowing the men of this unit as I think I do , having eaten and slept with them and shared their hardships and joys , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization would be unanimous in the acceptance of your ' able and fearless article as their sentiments . I think that it is a stain on the principles of the preamble and constitution of the American Legion to have it said that they are conducting a lobby in Washington to influence Congress in passing laws to give out billions of dollars as a recompense to strong , ablebodied men because they did their duty as true patriots : ' I would be very much disappointed if I thought for a moment that men who really saw service in the front lines were now willing to sell their birthrights for a mess of pottage . When I was discharged from the service I had $90 in my pocket , no job , with a family of four children and a wife to support , but thank God there has never been a moment in my struggles to get back where I was before the war that I was willing to sell the privilege and pleasure of doing my duty as I saw it in time of my country 's need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington will be fortunate enough to read your article and , instead of putting a. burden of $2,000,000,000 on our already overtaxed country , that they will make a law covering the following points : 1 . To properly take care of the families of those dear boys who gave up their lives for their country 's glory , and also to provide for those who are in any way maimed or who are not able to provide for themselves due to some mishap caused while in service . 2 . To increase the pay of the officers and men of the regular army and navy to an amount that they can live proper1Y , and not leave it as it is now , where , after necessary expenses to exist are paid , there is not enough spending Money left to buy tobacco . 3 . A universal training law , so that all of our young men who are physically fit can be called to arms at a moment 's notice , and tie well enough drilled to make a fighting army , and not show the sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of our drafted army , infantry doing the rudiments of squad drill on a hill in view of German batteries and thereby giving away the camouflaged position of their own artillery , and again a battalion of horse artillery parking their horses in the open , huddled together ha view of the heavy German batteries , who were using these horse clumps as registering points .
