Two widely separate incidents of last week may be forerunners of a new mode of air transportation . <P> At Berlin , the Raab-Katzenstein airplane makers hitched a motorless glider to the tail of a regular plane . To the tail of that glider they hitched a second glider . This " train " - the air equivalent of a motor truck with tandem trailers-taxied across the field and managed to take off , the plane tugging , the gliders lunging after . Soon the " train " straightened out in smooth flight and without difficulty attained an altitude of 1,200 ft . <P> By and by the pilot of the rearmost glider cut loose from the train and coasted comfortably to earth . Then the pilot of the other trailer did likewise . Finally the motored plane landed . <P> In Southern California , one Dale Drake , glider expert , persuaded his friend Lloyd O'Donnell to tow his glider by motored plane 200 miles to Long Beach , for a glider rodeo there . Their air train went well for 175 miles , a record air tow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tow rope broke . Glider Drake was left 7,200 ft. in the air . Undaunted , he coasted ten miles and landed safely in a barley field . <P> Such trains promise great economies in air transportation . The greater the load which a power plant can pull the cheaper the charges for passengers or freight , and the better the profits for the entrepreneurs . The chief difficulty at present seems to be the initial motive power to start the train from the ground . Once in the air the motor pull for a train is not much greater than for a single plane . Railroaders and motor truckers have the same problem on an easier scale . A solution for the air seems to be multi-motored planes with all engines working for the take-off and fewer for the " haul . " <P> Another apparent benefit of air trains is related to Speed , chief advantage of air over surface travel . A fast-flying train can touch at different airports without stopping , by cutting off its trailers one by one with passengers or freight .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
