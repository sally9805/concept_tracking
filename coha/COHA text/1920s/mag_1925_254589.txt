" I believe that the English show a more genuine interest in Art than any other group in Europe . ... A visitor to the London Royal Academy , or the English Art Clubs , or the new Chenil Gallery venture , invariably finds them filled with visitors capable of comprehending what is hung before them on the walls . . . . Artists who will be represented in our exhibition : John , Orpen , McEvoy , Paul Nash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Italian Art has grown rapidly in importance . . . . Not only will Italy be represented by such of its more widely known men as Tito and Mancini , but by others of the younger school . . .
