Every American summer ends in a wooden war that is betokened by a storm of straw . The storm occurs in ballparks when , on Sept. 15th , a homerun or a double play excites some fan to throw away his hat . The stiff disk spins out over the diamond ; 15,000 other gentlemen , if there is a good gate that day , see it and are reminded of something : this is the last day they can wear their straw hats . Off they come , out they go into the air , thousands of whirling discuses , boomerangs of straw , filling the air like a blizzard , piling up on the ground . And by this the wise perceive that in a week or two a war will begin-a war waged with good ash bats between nine men from the National League and nine men from the American League . Last week the first bugles blew . <P> American League . The Yankees ( New York ) , with a safe lead for the pennant , played their last Manhattan game and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among hostile western clubs . A swaggering , rakehell organization with such heavy-hitting outfielders as Paschal , Meusel , Ruth , Combs , they led their league on July 4th , and the team that leads on that day , say the wiseacres , will win the pennant . Babe Ruth , earlier called by his intimates " slob . . . sot . . good-for-nixey , " hit his 42nd home run ; Pitchers Bob Shawkey and Harold Wiltse did better than anyone had thought they could . Cleveland , second club in the league , fell short mainly for a lack of hitters . True , Second-Baseman George Burns broke the world 's two-base-hit record , but Tris Speaker , famed player-manager , once champion of the .300 hitters , tobogganed into 35th place . <P> National League . " Nobody , " said a pert fellow , " is going to beat us out now . " He , Rogers Hornsby , battering second baseman of the St. Louis Cardinals , had reference to his team 's chances of winning their pennant ; to the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the League has seen a bitter , three-cornered skirmish between Pittsburgh , St. Louis , Cincinnati ; last week each of them fought to the top in turn . Cincinnati and St. Louis have the best pitchers but the world 's series , as any newsboy knows , is a wooden war , and neither club is valiant with the ash . Rogers Hornsby himself , who last year was batting around .390 , has dropped 70 points ; he places his trust in a reprobate named after a President , Grover Cleveland Alexander . This man , a pitcher , is not in his first youth ; indeed , the press generally refers to him as a " veteran boxman , " but he has retained the bright ardor of his springtime . Early in the season he was dismissed from the Chicago Cubs for refusing to obey orders . Since , he has whipped the Cubs repeatedly . <P> New Players . One Babe Herman , large , shambling Brooklyn batsman , showed an early disrespect for National League pitchers . . . . Swarthy young Lazzeri has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Spurgeon of Cleveland , Gehringer of Detroit , Mellilo of St. Louis made effective debuts . . . .
