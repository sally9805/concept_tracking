" Newsgatherers sought put gigantic Singer Chaliapin in his dressing room , found him sitting hunched and disconsolate in a purple and cream silk dressing gown and red leather slippers . As everyone knows , M. Chaliapin 's English is quaint . Correspondents reproduced it as follows : " I was born and always will be , a ' people 's ' artist . I sing for everyone . Politics , I understand nothing , absolutely . I never was what you call capitalist . I earn all my money ; and everything I had in Russia was taken .

If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not imagine myself ' Englishman or Frenchman or American , because I am Russian . " " I think I do not do a crime in my conscience , in my soul I know I do not do a crime . But I am distressed . "
