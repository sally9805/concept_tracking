txt The commercial opening up of Mongolia , one of the most backviard of countries . by the American motor car was described yesterday at the American Museum of Natural History by Roy Chapman Andrews , who returned from his third expedition into the Gobi Desert with forty new dinosaur eggs , the skulls of si'x new types of mammals , which lived contemporaneously with the dinosaurs , and the tools of ancient Stone Age Peoples that once lived in the heart of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia . Camel caravans are trotting far into the interior of Mongolia and building up gasoline bases for the use of ? fast motor cars which rush sablek and ? other furs , wool and other products from distant bases to ' Urge , whence they are sent to Peking , according to Mr. Andrews . Three years ago tile American scientists drove all over the Gobi Desert in touring cars and motor trucks , covering ten times the ground which would have been possible if they had relied wholly on camels , and American business men made immediate use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient camel trails were fine motor roads , automobile expresses have been built up by traders for ' all valuable freight . The great handicap is the fuel problem . The camel is the only tank car at present , and the price of gasoline is such that only high-class freight can go by motor : Ears Were Stone Age Jewels . The primitive . flint instruments of early human beings were discovered near the very centre of the Gobi Desert , near the place where the dinosaur eggs were discovered three years ago . " We found that the Stone Age peoples had anticipated us in the discovery of the dinosaur eggs , " said ' Mr. Andrews . " They found the eggs about 20,000 years before we did and used square bits of shells for necklaces . Another type of Stone Age jewelry which we found here was made of ostrich eggs . " We were surprised also to find a Mongolian woman who had discovered the dinosaur eggs and was putting them to the same use that the Stone Age peoples had . She made bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soap , if she would deliver an intact fossil egg . This seemed a bargain for us , since the last price paid tor a dinosaur egg was $5,000 , but she was satisfied . She produced the fragments of several dinosaur eggs . We reached a Battlement by pay.ng her half a cake of soap for the fragments . " The five mammalian skulls found in the same rock formation with the dinosaur eggs constituted a find of the highest scientific value , because there was only one previous instance on record where a mammal was found existing in the dinosaur period , Mr. Andrews said . It had been supposed that the evolution of mammals did not take place until a later period . The primitive mammals , whose skulls were found , varied from the size of a mouse to that of a rat . To find them the scientists worked over a large area on their hands and knees , examining the ground inch by inch for tiny fragments of 10,000,000-year-old mammal bones . This special search was made on the ar- rival of a telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Museum of Natural HistorY , saying he had found a bit of mammal bone in cretaceous rock ( belonging to the age or reptiles ) among the masses of fossils sent back by the expedition of two years ago . Other *nteresting fosells belonged to several great females of animals which had been represented only by specimens found . in America . Another result of the expedition , according to Mr. Andrews , was the determination of the fact that the oldest dry land la that of Mongolia . It has been up above the sea level for shout 20,000,000 years , while every other part of the earth has been submerged for a part of that time at least . The expedition buta failed so far to obtain evidence that the forerunner of human beings dwelt gg tius Gobi Desert. , ' but it has succeeded in producing the first proof of man 's existence in the Gobi Desert at a fairly early period . " The earliest human relics which were found were tools belonging to a race which lived there ? some 50.000 to 100,000 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude stone scrapers of the Mousterian type which , are associated with a primitive type of human like the Neanderthal man . " The more advanced . stone age remains , which correspond to the . Azilian type in Europe , were found in strata at the bottom of a cliU where they had been gradually burr -4 from 100 to 200 feet deep by sand and dust . " These are the first remains of early man found in this part of the world . Prom the depth to which It was buried the culture of the Azilian type seemed to be much earlier than the Azilian period in Europe , suggesting that the Azilian style originated in Asia and was carried into Europe . " Some of the other discoveries reported by Mr , Andrews were these : The 3,000,000-year old remains of a vast redwood forest extending in Manchuria from . Mukden almost to Vladivoetoch , resembling the giant redwoods of California . The feet and part of the legs of a Baluchitherium , the largest land mammal that ever lived . This particular specimen was ' caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the legs ' were remaining because the rock formation in which the Baluchitherium was embedded was out away by erosion . The skull of a two-horned animal about the Eliza of a horse but belonging to no known species of animal . Evidences that in palaeozolc times art ocean extended through the Central Asian plateau from the Caspian Sean to the Pacific . Evidence that the Central Asian plateau was free from ice even when Europe was glaciated as ? far south as Spain and North America as far south as Texas . Thousands of specimens of fossil fish , reptiles and mammals , including many new to science . A herd of 50,000 antelope which probably do without drinking water at all , getting all their moisture from vegetation , and a herd of 1,000 wild asses which are almost equally deseleated . Mr. Andrews said that they , caught one baby wild ass which was very tame and friendly . One cold night a member of the party buttoned a chamois windbreaker over it . That night the young ass escaped , and , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ito front legs through the armholes of this garment and the buttons fastened under its ribs .
