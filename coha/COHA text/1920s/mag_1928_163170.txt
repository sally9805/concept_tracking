The high domed hall of Washington 's National Academy of Sciences rang with applause last week as famed scientists presented proofs of theories . They discussed : <P> Brains . The brains of three brilliant scientists , Sir William Osier , Granville Stanley Hall , Edward Sylvester Morse , were earnestly examined by Dr. Henry Herbert Donaldson of the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology , Philadelphia . He hoped these mighty mentalities had left some physical traces on the twisted convolutions of their brains . The tortuous hills and valleys of the cerebral hemispheres were much alike ; nothing could be inferred from them about the tastes and pursuits of the living minds . These are matters of the chemical relationships in the living tissue ; death blots them out ; the brains of dead men look very much alike , although the brains of scholars are generally a little heavier . <P> Dogs , Glands . Diseased glands are responsible for many blue ribbons in dog shows . The Boston bulldog with his round head , short muzzle , short legs , suffers from abnormal thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarf ; the skulls of dwarf and bulldog are strikingly similar . The kindly , overgrown St. Bernard , with his heavily wrinkled forehead , massive limbs , shows a pathological pituitary gland . The same condition in man produces the enormous heavily boned circus giant . Dr. Charles Rupert Stockard of Cornell University Medical College experimented with some of these pure blooded deformities . Crossing a famous Great Dane sire with a noted St. Bernard he found that all the pups of the several litters died within 30 hours , although both bitch and sire were parents of previous prize winners . Autopsies on the litters revealed diseased kidneys throughout ; the external sex organs of the male pups seemed normal but the internal sex organs were definitely female in type , showing that the pituitary gland has a profound influence on sex development . - <P> Plants , Lamps .. Plants are hard working members of society . Dr. John Morris Arthur of Boyce Thompson Institute , New York tried to fool them into working all night as well as all day by turning on 48 1,000 watt incandescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; lettuce and radish 17 hours of the time ; tomatoes rebelled , died . <P> More Matter . The physicists are creeping up on the origin of matter . Dr. Robert Andrew Millikan of the California Institute of Technology , pursuing his study of the cosmic ray , has illuminated new chapters in the celestial life of the hydrogen atom . Those infinitely tiny but infinitely active particles not only leap at each other explosively to form helium , but also by special jumps unite to form oxygen and nitrogen . The exact nature of the jump is not yet fully understood , but each different jump shoots off its own private signal , a ray of definite power . <P> Professor Millikan has climbed the highest mountains , in Bolivia , Panama , California ; measured these rays ; found them about 200 times as penetrating as an
