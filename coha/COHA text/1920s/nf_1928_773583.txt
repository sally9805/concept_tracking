txt ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST such things without a suspicion of any need for the xsthetics of a later day . Now that artists and critics have brought about a consciousness of qualities that the earlier collectors did not know , the whole situation is changed , and Ananias must offer a different type of goods to the artists if they are to believe in the things and , in their turn , pass them on to the world . Already with Lenbach we saw that it was merely the lack of a good tradition that brought him to do his dull and unpleasant painting . We have seen Sargent and Besnard cling to such rags of the truth as they got from the good artists whom they frequented in their early days . As the wave of the worst of modern art recedes , professionals and laymen see the problem more clearly . Even the museums must soon become conscious that a work like Gerome 's Pygmalion and Galatea offers us only the deadest dross in exchange for the living spirit of Greece . Perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture by Mr. French here reproduced . They do not like it , and so they have not troubled to explain to themselves wherein its error consists . The idea of the artist 's work going on through the centuries when the sculptor himself is dead may be as obvious and as consoling as The Doctor by Sir Luke Fildes , which they have conveniently pigeonholed as " literary . " But the epithet quite overshoots the mark and hits many of the great 1501 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST men , Fra Angelico for example , as a type of the story-tellers of religious art . The real contradiction appears when we notice the difference between the two arts shown in the present work . That of the Egyptian finds in a physical " unreality " the symbol of his ancient faith , that of the modern sculptor can imagine nothing better than to make a naturalistic copy of two models , one male and one female , the latter decked out with a pair of wings to tell that she represents Death . Bully Bottom and his companions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dream " have about the same conception of art when they tell their audience to recognize the moon because the worthy tailor who plays the part carries a lantern . We laugh when the simple actor who plays the wall holds up his fingers to represent the hole through which the lovers kissed ; but many people are coming to feel that Mr. French 's stagecraft is only a little less naive . Or rather , using a phrase that means for them that there is something wrong in his work but difficult to define , they say it is " old school . " Will they feel the wrongness of a work when it is " new school " ? One may believe they are moving toward the ability for that when we note the number of connoisseurs who differentiate between Mr. Manship and the Greeks as definitely as they recognize that the abyss betwen Mr. French and the Egyptians is measured in terms of art far more than by centuries . 1151 r ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST XII The danger of a new Reign of Error , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have , of course , not purged ourselves of all its bad conceptions , and for an old form that dies there is a new one to replace it . But the new mistakes are not quite so widespread ; there is a larger nucleus of cultured people to resist them . Above all , there are , in all countries , exhibitions outside the control of Ananias : it is not possible for another Cezanne to be kept out of contact with his public for forty years . I know about the mote and the beam ; and have asked myself whether a generation that acclaims Matisse and Derain is as far from the truth as the admirers of Meissonier and Gerome . Have we a new academy ? That would mean a new group of teachers ? and one looks in vain for teachers among the " modernists . " Are the men of today making blunders as bad as those of the past ? The most serious trouble with the work of the present-day men ( aside even from the weaklings who merely swim with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away by the market demand for their pictures when once they have reached success , and produce too hastily , scanting the work . But people soon feel that one Vlaminck is of a time when he was " turning them out , " another when he kept ( his high spirits in hand and ' 1 151 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST pushed on to the admirable quality of his best work . As between Picasso and his imitators the distinction is not hard . to make . The errors of those who like " modern art " are apt to be on matters of detail , not along the big lines of principle , though the fundamental matter of idea is apt to be neglected for a time , at least , when we are caught by a new toy , like the bright color of Impressionism or the simple , building-block logic of the minor Cubists . But the mistake does not last in the case of people who look on art with any seriousness . Just the matter of the people who judge is a safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " old school , " but the man in the street has less to do with deciding things today . He may be able to recognize the truth in homely statements of common experience , and yet be imposed on in matters which have to be put into less elementary language . At least a slight acquaintance with the arts of poetry and music is necessary before he can realize that in " Die Forelle " Heine and Schubert produced one of the most beautiful of all songs . Yet it was his own proverb about catching fish in troubled waters which offered its dull fact as the filament which was to become incandescent with the genius of the two artists . Our " plain man " goes to the concert where Elena Gerhardt sings the masterpiece , and when he is back in the street he again hums the " tingel-tangel " . 153 // that is natural for him . It is true that the nature of music is such as to keep him from getting as far from art in it as he does in painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , of what is harmony and what is discord , gives to a large public the power to distinguish between good and bad ; so , too , the greater knowledge of the other arts , which the museums and exhibitions arc creating , must prevent a recurrence of the worst conditions we have witnessed . It is trying , to be sure , to see false art in the new movements , from which we might have hoped for a sign of our progress in appreciation ( there is , naturally , no such thing as progress in art itself ) . But again , what is worthless among productions of those who follow the modern forms is accepted by so few people . Without the school-taught ability to copy nature , without even the academic formula for design and color , the counterfeit of art of the modernist camp-followers is about the poorest thing in the whole scale . It usually avoids cheap sentiment , but cheap aesthetics is just as futile . Its one chance for acceptance lies in the " snobbism " that swallows the rubbish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad things of the old school . One more chance for Ananias to mislead artists and public ! A move to the modernist camp would give him a magnificent strategic position in which he could do business under the protection of his former enemies . 154 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST And when he sets out to be modern , he can employ quite wonderfully the methods of the advertiser ? with whom , as we have seen , he has dealt so much in the fields of commerce . He has quantity production to dispose of , just like the manufacturers . He can offer the goods cheap ? with tempting tales of profits made in the past , and so appeal to the speculator , who might just as well buy this stuff as oil stock . Of late he has been sending out broad-sheets , much like those of certain houses in the fringe of Wall Street , telling of the wonderful " find " of a neglected master of the modern school , and giving the public a chance to get in on the Ground floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few well-placed newspaper puffs , disclosing the phenomenal sales of the new genius , will catch the people who still follow the trail of " success " in art , instead of looking for themselves at pictures , and owning what they enjoy . Mr. E. E. Cummings is fascinated by the catchwords of the advertisements , and his collection must contain some wonderful ones , like that of the cigarette company which uses the line , When they smoke for pleasure " One asks oneself what other reason there is for smoking , and then one looks at certain art-collections and sees that the pictures in them were not bought to afford pleasure . They could hardly have come from anything but the desire to get ahead of the neighbors , in tokens of wealth or culture . The ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST more " modern " the art of the bad collection , the less joy it seems to offer . After all , only a weak , lazy attention was demanded by the old pretty-girl picture . Its interest was genuine , for we all relish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the artist who suggested these things was the welcome one . If he also suggested a life freed of pretense to the dull , sexless morality which found its lying symbol in the ugly clothes of the nineteenth century , so much the better ! When the future goes into its museum of old costumes and looks at our pantaloons , corsets , and trailing skirts , it will understand the nostalgia for a world where Paul and Virginia disported themselves in the quasi-nudity of The Storm . When the gifted son of Bohemia gave to his contemporaries a glimpse of this world , where he was supposed to dwell , it was but natural that the bourgeois should pay well for his moments in the land of Cockayne . He would pay , too , for nice pink newsboys who reminded him of his rise from the ranks of the workers , or for a nice landscape that " babbled of green fields " and reminded him of the country place which he had just bought . The painter was a good painter in proportion to his skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " aesthetic guff . " Or as Max Liebermann expressed the matter , " Immer das Kunststiick , nie das Kunstwerk. " ti ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST What chance of success is there for the man who can neither catch Mr. Babbitt on a Kunststiick ? a feat of skill ? . nor produce the Kunstwerk which appeals to the art-lovers ? Most of the false art of the Post-Impressionist , Cubist , and Post-Cubist time is such a sorry joke , and so well known as that by people who like the real men of those groups , that the main difficulty here is to find examples worthy of notice . After dealing with the famous men considered previously , it would be exaggerating the importance of a lot of poor whippersnappers to put them in the pillory , if one could remember their names at all . The work done by the modern schools in abolishing the lure of the subject ( at the price , for a time , of showing no visible feature of the subject ) has already had a very solid effect in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained by his proper means of form and color , and not by competing with the tangible object . Refusal to use this , the finest variety of the birdlime furnished by Ananias , leaves the False Artist very poor in resources . The snob is unreliable ; he will hasten on to the next " new school " as soon there is one . The man who wants museum art can not be depended on much more ; he will either spend his money on ancient things or discover which modern ones really contain the classic qualities . There remains that species of malcontent whose hatred of the 157 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST past makes him go in for modernity at any price . We have seen him gobbling down Bakst as a protest against Bouguereau . In France he caused his representatives in the government to give commissions to an Impressionist . Besnard was , after all , pretty close to the Ecole ; and while he might be somewhat modern , Henri Martin would be the real thing . Look at those dabs of bright color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ! And for his position as the " Official Revolutionist " ( the title he has earned ) , he had the further advantage of doing nice , charming figures with " good " drawing ? which showed that the Revolution , this time , would not destroy what was agreeable in the past . The same men who hailed Henri Martin 's lilac-scented powder-puffs turned away from the genuine renewal of the Impressionists ' research , in the hands of Signac and Seurat . The same Ersatz Brot psychology in the Post-Impressionist period is what has given us , instead of the masterpieces in the time of Paul Elie Dubois , the big " Ku Klux picture " by him that hangs in the Metropolitan Museum , where it received its nickname from the white hoods and robes of the Algerian women it represents . But as we come down to the men of today , there is more and more difficulty to find in France examples of the Ananias school that have achieved any great degree of prominence . The names of Picasso and 4158 ANANIAS OR THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , and even people who do not like them concede the extent of their success . Seurat is no longer spoken of as ugly , the word of 1884 , when he and his group founded the Independents . His picture of the Bathers , first shown at the memorable exhibition of that year , was bought for the Tate Gallery j London at a big price , or what seemed one a short time ago ; and , when the pictures of the late John Quinn were put on view in New York the Ambassador of France came from Washington in order to accept the great collector 's bequest to the Louvre of a picture by Seurat . The partisans of modernity-at-any-price who " arrive " are almost all outside the country which , having most contributed to the production of modern art , is also reaching a state of calmer judgment on the subject . And so , for conspicuous examples of the counterfeit of art in the new schools , one has to turn to peoples like the Slays , with their Mestrovic and Grigoriev . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany ? the desire to reach a tradition suited to the national character , and it is permissible to hope , at least , that the changes may bring about results in the end happier than those of the beginnings . The Futurists of Italy were more concerned with bombastic political clamor about a new Italian greatness ( of which Mussolini 4159 . ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST appears to be the present exponent ) , than with getting a solid basis for their art , and so there is no reason for surprise in its shipwreck . Paris and London were practically unanimous as to the deadness of the Futurist pictures when they were first shown . But Mestrovic still has his place in the limelight , though it is cruel to him in its revelation of the poor , academic basis on which he has piled up his reminiscences of the Byzantine , Rodinesque , and Cubistic schools . They fail so completely to amalgamate , that only people unused to discerning the qualities of sculpture fail to realize that a work like the one here reproduced is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colossal for the significant . Similarly , Grigoriev 's planes and angles , accented according to the Cubistic conventions , make only a new skin ? and a transparent one ? over the bad form and color in his picture of Old Trombola . Fierce impatience with the tyranny of the past ? a political past , once more ? gives to the Slavic strength of both the sculpture and the painting last mentioned an appearance of artistic power . It fades away when we see how incomparably nearer they are to the weak tradition of their countries than to the living idea of the arts they have tried to enter . With them we may take leave of the devious line of the art that we have been following at such length . It is far from having run its course , but it is today . i6o ) ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST confused and leaderless as compared with what it was in the days of Gerome , Lenbach , and Sir Frederick Leighton , P:R.A. ? to mention one more name , and a prominent one , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louvre , in the society of that title , gave a great sigh of relief when American dollars outbid French francs for possession of Regnault 's Salome . The painter 's death on a battlefield of 1870 and his consequent position as a hero made his wretched picture a menace to their walls ; they had been unable to overcome the zeal of the " patriots , " during the next war , who thought that Regnault 's connection with the national glory entitled Salome to a place in the national museum . The danger , one of the last serious ones , had been averted ? for them ? and Christopher Columbus was thanked once more for discovering America . Pazienza , col tempo ; as our store of good works increases , as they make their influence felt among artists and collectors , there will grow up a love of art informed by understanding of it which will avert the danger of counterfeits , for us . Eternal vigilance may well be the price of liberty in the fields of politics and economics , for the old evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art is more happily situated , for we can get to the root of things in it , and can make them healthy . Future writers on Ananias will have to record names among his de-4161 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST scendants that have not yet reached renown ; but we may be sure that they will be harder to find than are those among which our harvest has been so lamentably plentiful . It has been aptly observed that what prevents the acceptance of art is not ignorance , but prejudice . A person who has seen little of good pictures will take to them more readily than one who has been trained in a false school . The best condition , of course , is that of persons or nations that have always been surrounded by the products of a genuine tradition , and the reason for the change now occurring is that more acquaintance with the true arts is already making people see the futility of the false ones . 4 162. 1 CHAPTER IV A SURVEY OF CONDITIONS I EVEN if a better knowledge of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remains the phenomenon of the number of artists in the modern time , and the enormous percentage of bad ones . If your severity is only onetenth of that required for our previous estimate , there are still thirty-nine out of the forty thousand artists in Paris whose work is no asset for the world ? though , as I have said , they may be of some use in interesting the general public . Be one hundred times as generous as I ( and the other people who would say that there is no greater number of real talents today than in the days of Ingres , Corot , and Daumier ) : you have still thirty thousand men and women who can show only the weakest justification for their presence in the profession . If their desire were really to help art , instead of to play with it , they would make money , buy works by the genuine men , and see to it that the X163 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST museums and exhibitions were maintained at the highest possible level . They do make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority of cases is it enough for more than a bare living . When they are rich they go in for motor-cars , clothes , country houses , etc. , just like the business man and his wife ; and not much oftener than those honest people does the wellto-do painter or sculptor have a collection that means something for the benefit of his profession . Every museum official , reviewing the people he secs in his daily rounds , can bear witness that the number of artists who come often to the galleries is astonishingly small ; and the good Lord knows whether the people who organize exhibitions find the mass of artists going into them with an idea of raising the level of art , or in order to gain personal success ! If the mere numbers of artists throughout the world today are improving conditions ( which is debatable ) , their influence on the public taste is not the thing that makes them adopt art as a life work . It is time to try for an answer to the questions asked on an earlier page : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do they fail at it ? The reason would seem to lie in the very restricted outlet now afforded for the art-instinct which the past has stored up in mankind . Old India had more wisdom than we sometimes recognize , in her theory of the castes . If we can not 4164 ) . ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST accept them as a rigid system with tyrannical powers , we have ourselves ample material for tracing out the persistence of racial , local , and professional habits of mind . William James has observed that only ancestral habit keeps certain communities to the hard life of the peasant or the fisherman , when other occupations offer so much more ease and remuneration . There is such a thing as the call of the soil . And Eugene O'Neill 's old sailor , who had sent his child to be raised a thousand miles inland , is only one of innumerable instances of those who have known the irresistible call of the sea . Can we doubt that men feel in their blood the passion of their ancestors when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains of Tennessee , making his way against the harsh condition of early America to the ocean that he had dreamed of but never seen , and then , through a long life devoted to seafaring , becoming one of the great seers of his noble profession ? In the old centuries , if a man felt in his veins nothing that united him to the caste of the soldier , the peasant , the trader , the priest , and others , if his whole instinct made him turn to art , there were a hundred doors open to him . He could be a worker in iron , or wood , or pottery , or paper ( with written or printed characters ) , in textiles , or glass , or the innumerable ancient and splendid things to which the hands of the craftsmen have given their dignity . Go X165 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST once more to the Museum and see whether among a given 40,000 artists of the past , more than about a hundred were painters or sculptors . The rest worked in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters , they carried something of the great spirit into utilitarian forms ? and had pride in doing so . Today they are disinherited outcasts from the callings of their forefathers . The machine has taken their jobs ; and when they look about for an escape from the ramifications of business life , which surrounds them everywhere in the modern world , they find only painting and sculpture still open to them . Even so , these are pretty badly cut off from their old basis of architecture . If painting and sculpture have concentrated their effort in the less monumental styles , if they have managed to absorb some of the energy that once went into the crafts , they are impoverished by loss of the support they once had from the buildings . Often , indeed , they were an integral part of the architecture , and did as much for its splendor as the underlying construction . The age of commerce and the age of steel changed that construction . First came the quasi-bankruptcy of architectural style in the earlier nineteenth century ; then came the skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter part of the modern time . As we have seen , the period has not so much as begun to 4166 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST attain an understanding of decoration on a par with its genius for construction . Here , then , are reasons why the artists in Paris have multiplied from 200 to 40,000 in a century ( with a corresponding increase in the rest of Europe , and America ) , and why all but a few are failures . The age-old need to work with the hands explains the first point , the fact that the higher arts are not the work of the hands ? that " painting is a mental thing " as Leonardo put it , explains the futility of most of the work of the last seventy-five years or more . In general , it is scarcely within the purview of this book . It is not so much the work of the False Artists as of incompetent artists . II Were there not a danger of confusing the issues , we might inquire whether all the men considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . Meissonier applied to picture-making the attention to minute detail which might , in the past , have given us the marvels of accuracy that we see in the gauntlets of the old armorers , the complication of their scheme and . the delicacy of adjustment in the little plates of steel almost recalling nature 's own miraculous devices in the human hand . We have seen that in an artist of the great time , like Brueghel , 1 X67 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST the " mental thing " was the end which all the perfect workmanship subserved ; and in no period but the modern one do we find a Meissonier carried away by his skill with the means ? and carrying with him a big public unconscious of the pettiness of his work . Consider two other old-time masters of minutia . A painting by Fouquet , perhaps three by four inches in size , and containing innumerable figures , each of an incredible perfection of detail , looks as big as a fresco when reproduced . The scale is not less than majestic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole period , not simply that of the parvenus of culture . The caste-system of Fouquet 's time put the decision as to art-matters in the hands of men prepared for it by the presence in their castles of great art from an earlier day . A Fouquet worked for the princes of the Church and State , and the peasant 's bowl and knife were made by other men ? who had their traditions also , and their joy in their craft . The case is no different when we turn to Flanders and see what van Eyck did in painting for the merchants . What is there in the world to surpass the closeness of observation in the John Arnol fini and his Wife in the National Gallery in London ? The man 's character , the woman 's figure , the reflection in the mirror , all come back to one with incomparable sharpness of definition , even after years during which 4 68 ? ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST one has not seen the picture . But each detail in this stupendous piece of Gothic art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cathedral . Being unable to build cathedrals in the modern time ( and I think that not even the most fervent supporters of our attempts would call them architecture , in the sense we gave to the word at Notre Dame or Chartres ) , we square our score with the great epoch by calling its painters " Primitives . " The misunderstanding of the past by the people who invented this epithet has no equal save in the ignorance of the whole problem of art shown by the men treated in this book . Back and forth across the centuries one goes , without finding anything to balance it . No wonder the fabled Golden Age of art was located in the past , and recent work was suspect . We struck bottom in the modern time . To say so is indeed to understate the case . Our false painting and sculpture are not only the worst things ever produced ; they are in a class of badness never before known . The dregs of GrecoRoman art make a poor enough show when compared with the things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodrama , the most groveling approach to paltriness of their late realists , loom up as something colossal beside the ineptitudes of our time . Titian might caricature the figures of the Laocoon group as squirming monkeys , and so avenge the later world for its subjection to the decadence of classical 169 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST art , but what knowledge , what power was still in the ancient body when the fresh mind of the Christian era gave the genius of the world into other hands . Those who have tasted the delights offered by Greek sculpture of the centuries preceding this time may venture to pronounce the word decadence before the Laocoon ? but they take a risk in doing so : the thing is prodigious . Even a late copy of Greek sculpture is sometimes not less than bewildering in its perfection . Michael Angelo 's admiration for such things can not be discounted because of the fact that he did not know Athens and Olympia . He knew the glorious work of Niccola Pisano , and if he studied the late products of antiquity instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached a culmination and a decline , his genius demanded the nourishment of a period of full knowledge and full consciousness . After the fall of pagan Rome , come centuries torn by the incursions of fierce peoples from the north , and troubled by the differences between the mind of Europe and that of the Orient , in their new meeting at Constantinople . But the most barbaric stuff of the time has its vigor to recommend it , and what we called Byzantine rigidity and effeteness in the days of our ignorance is seen , upon better acquaintance , to proceed from one of the great arts of the world . When we come down to the poorest aftermath of the Renaissance , we find that the sentimental piety ( 170 ' ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST pictures of a Carlo Dolci or a Sassoferrato still hold something of the immense style attained in the period before them ; the heavy , black paintings turned out as a sort of factory product from Bolognese workshops , too poor to be identified by more than the name of some late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an astonishing degree , and handled with a breadth and clearness that recall at times the great work of a century or more before . As long as the activity is kept up at all , it is genuine in its very lack of inspiration , the authentic expression of Italy 's weariness . Her effort , unparalleled in its time , had left but little energy for the late corners of the school . And , conversely , the best reason for condemning the False Artists of our time lies in the fact that they misrepresent us , for we are not in a period of decadence . The modern period is one of research , of invention , of courage and creativeness . Its character can be expressed only by works of the same qualities , and there is a wealth of them around us . I think there is one analogue in the past for the condition we have been witnessing . It is not furnished by the provincial artists of Germany and Flanders , who , after the rapid rise and fall of painting in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When some musty little museum shows us these almost forgotten pictures , they are r 171 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST as tedious as could well be imagined in their whimpering poverty . But again , they are the end of a great line and , making no pretense to be more than things of their country , they may even have an echo of its greatness . The same is true of the late art of Holland , as it drags down to its sleep in the eighteenth century . But our hunt for knowledge at the Museum really yields fruit when we reach the sculpture of Cyprus . At first sight this seems a strange place and time to look for the art of Ananias ? several centuries indeed before he was born ! But the Bible story , like all the masterpieces , applies to a period before its own , as well as to one eighteen or nineteen hundred years later , such as we have been examining . And see the way in which similar conditions in the two epochs produce similar effects . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cypriote works , were the great race of traders . Their wanderings over the known world in search of gain and adventure did not result in the building up of a body of faith like that of the Assyrians , the Egyptians , and the Greeks . The ideas of these three peoples took the form of art ? whether in palaces and temples , pyramids and obelisks , the Parthenon and the theater , or in sculpture , painting , and ceramics . Those are the tokens of the religious mind and of the artist mind . The Phoenicians , having no strong basis of such ideas , could produce no art of their own , sot they borrowed it from 4 172. 1 ' ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST the great schools before them . Though the stature of the whole epoch , and their nearness in time and place to their models , prevented them from falling into such grotesque results as we have seen from AlmaTadema and Gerome , the falseness of the work is almost as complete . In the relief showing Hercules with the cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale fashion in which the sculptor has appropriated the art of the Assyrians , most evidently seen in the profile of the bearded man . But this relief dates from the latter part of the sixth century B.C. ; and for over a hundred years there had been no one alive who could do genuine Assyrian work , or impart its vanished principles to newcomers . That did not trouble our sculptor 's public ; they were not squeamish as to such minor matters . They did n't know about art , but they knew what they liked , precisely as the patrons of the modern Salon did ; and one can almost imagine a Cypriote art-salesman assuring his customers that this work was of the finest quality and just like the classic things of the past ? as a New York dealer could make his clients see the color and quality of Tintoretto 's painting in a picture by Watts , the " finish " of a Terburg in the meretricious slightness of Fortuny , and the art of Frans Hals in the slippery brush-work of Laszlo . The last-named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors ad-173 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST dressed themselves for their portraits , which hang on their walls with the Hals , the Rembrandts , the Vermeers , and the Ingres ( works by Reynolds , Hoppner , and Lawrence helping effectively to bridge the gap , however ) . To see such a combination is almost enough to make one join the Philistines in their idea that people buy pictures out of sheer emptiness of mind . It would be unjust to the dealers to hold them alone answerable for the confusion ; it comes at least as much from higher sources . Let me recall a lecture on Raphael by a professor of fine arts at an American college ( both may remain nameless , like the two collectors of a moment ago , since there are so many other collectors , professors , and colleges like them ) . This particular guide of American youth said that the art of the great Urnbrian had not passed from the world , for Kenyon Cox 's drawings were as fine as those of Raphael . When a new incumbent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinguished artist was asked to give his recommendation to one of the candidates . He had already spoken for another of them , and when surprise was expressed at his giving support to so poor a painter , he replied , testily , " Well , he 'll do for a professor , wo n't he ? He knows the names and dates , and can give lectures , ca n't he ? " Of another college authority on art , whose writings are used as . 174 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST text-books , a practical expert on the professor 's subject remarked , " The trouble with him is that when he is n't teaching , he 's studying books in the library . As for getting any first-hand knowledge of the subject he treats ? he does n't look at pictures one day in the year . " The artist having been treated as a superior type of skilled workman by the professor , returns the contempt with interest ; and the great profession of teaching is the sufferer ? together with the students who , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushel of chaff . Every so often one feels remorseful at what sounds like harshness toward a mistaken past ( the matter of the professors , however , is of the present hour ) . But as to the absurd statement about Mr. Cox 's drawing in that lecture , it was mentioned only to exemplify a kind of superficiality forever threatening us . The final responsibility for it does not lie with the professors , any more than with the dealers . All things in art , good and bad , are ultimately to be traced to the artist , in this case the painter who , in his academies ? as the French call figures such as are drawn in art-schools ? imitated Raphael 's studies . If there is unkindness in dwelling on this phase of Mr. Cox 's work , it may be repaired by directing attention to his picture of The Harpist at the Metropolitan Museum . Its unassuming charm caused it to be acquired by an artist who was also a true con 175 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST noisseur . He remarked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'd buy a picture by Kenyon Cox . " The words of the man who could recognize by his act the merit possessed by the other painter showed that he also saw the failure of the major effort of Mr. Cox 's career . Surface imitation of Raphael such as his , the sentence of the professor who indorsed it , the patter of the dealers who sold it , and the mentality of the art-commissions that ordered it for public buildings arc phenomena which would lead us to believe that the modern era in art is simply the age of the Cypriotes once more , if we did not have evidence of a different genius in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . No one dreams of regarding the art of Cyprus as representative of its great period , but not less than millions of people in our time have known no other art than that which continues the character of the most debased product of antiquity . How clearly we see the mind of the False Artist , as we know him today , in a work like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Cypriote work discussed , it dates from a time long past the one when the great art from which it derives was alive and genuine . Perhaps the man who did this was " sincere , " to recall the pet word of excuse for such artists ; perhaps he really thought his work was like that of the archaic Greeks . That scarcely consoles us for the absence of their qualities when 4 176 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST we see the poor , smirking expression of this face instead of the irresistible lighting up of the features given by the Hellenic sculptor as he becomes aware of the still timid but exhilarating increase of his power . In a headless fragment , the difference is only the more sensible : before the subtle planes of the face were mastered in Greece , the large forms of the body were understood and related with matchless aesthetic science . As many men have observed , the basis of Greek sculpture is impersonal , something that has a truth transcending the fugitive impressions of the artist as much as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of classical art , " writes Paul Valery in his admirable study of the European mind , " without inevitably choosing the monument of Greek geometry as its best example . " If there is a vestige of the logic of Greece in these Cypriote things , it is only less garbled than the references to the masters found in the Ananias-art of the modern time . III At least the Cypriotes had enough modesty not to set up as schoolmasters ? which , as we have seen , was what the False Artists of the nineteenth century did . If their schools are under the strongest suspicion today , if the question of so many a young artist going to Paris is , " What good ' modern man can I study ' 177 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST under ? " , the fault rests squarely on the shoulders of the teaching which characterized the reign of Ananias . Travestying Raphael and the Greeks , the men who claimed to represent the classical tradition bear the sole responsibility for the reaction against those masters . Theirs also is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general in the past is being neglected by many today . The shallowness in the work of the academic teachers so disgusted the young men as to lead them to avoid the schools . That naturally made men like Leon Bonnat cry anarchy : what they did not see was that they themselves were the cause of such anarchy as existed . It was not , however , what they imagined ? the better artists had simply founded their own schools , or clubbed together in studios where they practiced drawing without supervision . Even in the official ateliers many were heard to say that they came merely to use the model , and paid no attention to the criticism of the professor . Good men refused to teach ? as we have seen in the case of Claude Monet . A deep student like Matisse found that the people who came to work under him wanted merely to find out how he got his " effects . " He closed his door on all pupils when he realized that he was being applied to ( in a majority of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that his position in Paris X178 . ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST was the result of the hardest delving into the principles of his art . He had set his pupils to drawing from a cast of the Mars Borghese and they had been mystified if not aggrieved at his concealing his " secrets , " still more so when he said there were none save those which study at the Louvre and hard work at home would explain . Things are topsy-turvy indeed when the great role of the teacher is misunderstood to the extent that we see today . Many a good modern artist bears the scars of his struggle to attain a rational mode of procedure . Often it is only in later life that he has come to see that the study of form is fundamental as a base for his painting or sculpture , and to realize what a beautiful thing drawing is . Modeling that gave a mere simulacrum of roundness , and drawing that wiggled into a slavish copy of the contours , characterized the art which was the most general product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical matters like the chemical action of paints , oils , and grounds , is not the least of the indictment against it . From the school to the exhibition was only a step in the course laid out by the False Artists , just as the next step was admission to the museums . Do you ask how else matters should be ? Shall we have no schools , no exhibitions , no museums ? I have already declared my belief in teaching . Exhibitions are of enormous use in letting artists know what is being 179 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST done , and which among the diverse tendencies of a changing age are those that offer hope for development ; and for the public to know the art of the day they are a necessity , under modern conditions ; also they can be a source of the most real enjoyment and instruction . Museums are , or should be , the exponents of all that is best in art . But everything depends on the way the three institutions are directed . When the school sets money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the school is doing that if its one purpose is either immediate profit , for an owner ( perhaps a teacher ) , or eventual profit , for a system . On this score , even the Ananias men can not be accused of a deliberate betrayal of trust . When their own work was rotted through with the compromises demanded by an always more degraded market , their adherence to bad methods in the school was an honest one . They believed in their system and hoped that , somehow , the new generation would get back to the psychology that gave the great results of the past . To face the fact that their own careers had been based on falsehood , a thing which always begets deeper falsehood , would have been too appalling for men who ? at their worst ? retained some memory of the significance of their ancient profession . As conditions are today , with young people in steadily increasing thousands applying at the schools , there is probably no chance to follow out in practice 18o ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old studios . There would be too few studios to house the aspirants who would apply , to say nothing about placing them in the studios of good artists . If we ever get back to reasonable numbers again ( a state we are today almost unable to conceive ) the apprentice system may be restored . But till then we must probably content ourselves , in the main , with seeing to it that teachers in the schools are the best obtainable ? that outside of the indispensable technical instruction they must give , there shall be also an incentive for the students to work toward a better general state of affairs instead of a worse one . A few years ago , a visitor to an American artschool whose enrollment reaches the enormous number of five thousand students , was struck with the low type of art toward which all the work he had seen appeared to be pointing . " But are n't there any good studios here ? " he asked of his guide , an instructor at the school . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied the latter ? a young artist of merit , who added to his income by teaching . " Mr. A 's pupils are doing pretty well for beginners ; Mr. B 's are quite competent in their way . " " Yes , just so . But you like good pictures , and I do ; and I am sure neither of us would ever want a picture that came from even twenty years more of 4181 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST working in their way . ' Are n't there any studios that seem to promise a good artist or two for the future ? " " Oh , if you mean that ? no . We 're asked for a definite result : men able to do good practical drawings for catalogues , magazines , cartoons , posters , etc. , with sometimes a man to paint portraits and make a living at it . Most of the students come from families of moderate means , and when they go back to their home towns they want to make good . I 'd like to work with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I should n't be very long on the job if I waited for that . " His logic was fair enough for the conditions around him . But it also illustrated the vicious circle in which we revolve when artists , teachers , and students follow the taste of a public whose ideas , in turn , come from the bad pictures in the museums . If the masters there were the ones consulted , they would not afford justification for false ideas . But go to any museum which has both good and bad works on a day when the crowds are there . The Greek rooms will be practically deserted ; the Old Masters of painting will hold the attention of a few persons who are evidently enjoying them , while a few others are attempting to like them ; but the great mass of the visitors will be in the galleries of modern work , and that would be a very healthy sign if the modern paint182.1 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST ings and sculptures were not so low in their average of merit . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the last few years , perhaps even a Cezanne , will tell the educated visitor that the great tradition continues vigorously ; but to the ignorance of the majority , the modern rooms are almost a condemnation of the ancient ones . The people feel , rightly , that there is a fundamental difference between a Ranger landscape and a Ruisdael landscape ; they decide , wrongly , that the picture of a place they know , painted in familiar colors , is the one with which to spend their time . It is too much to ask the ordinary layman to proceed directly to the great things of the old days . He almost thinks that you are making fun of him if you say that a Sienese Madonna is a thing of the rarest beauty . That squint-eyed , hatchet-faced shadow of a woman ? But if he had been seeing some of the drawings of Odilon Redon just before , if he had gotten interested in the faces from Toulouse-Lautrec 's pictures of Parisian music-halls , it would have been easier to trace for that layman the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the changes of the schools , it would have been easier for him to see that the sense of form which the Sienese used in describing a woman of his time was at only the slightest remove from that of the two modern men , whose vision is so much more accessible to their contemporaries . 4 183 ) ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST Linking us with the ancient things of the Museum stand those intermediaries I spoke of before ? the artists of our own time . It is at the current exhibitions that we see their work . Let the reader think back to all the big shows of contemporary work he can remember in America or in Europe . Do they point to a higher or a lower level in the Museum , when its galleries receive their new accessions from these Salons , Academies , the various World 's Fair exhibits , etc. ? No wonder that the public thinks that the works shown there represent the real art of modern times , and accepts the word " revolutionary " for works such as were seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van Gogh , Matisse , and the Cubists were first revealed to the mass of the American people . When , somewhat less than a year after that event , the collection of Mr. J. P. Morgan was put on view , it was astonishing to note how nearly the same was the expression of the big public at the two exhibitions . Both were large-scale demonstrations of the way an unprepared democracy approaches art . " The old man knew about finance , all right , but those artdealers certainly put over some awfully raw things on him , " were the exact words of a remark heard in the crowd that surged and gaped through those galleries of unimaginable treasure . And the remark was confirmed by the looks , nudges , and chuckles of countless ignorant ( if quite honest and otherwise esti4184 ) . ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST mable ) people who glanced at the elongated Gothic figures in the pale tapestries , the curving body in an ivory carving , the " caricaturish head on an Umbrian plate , or the weird beast forming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely as they did at the Armory Show ? that if this was art , then art was what the statesman before quoted called " the bunk . " They liked real art , the kind that did n't require all this study and explanation . And the big annual exhibitions furnished it . The men who have been treated here as the victims of the Ananias-spirit were no victims , but great lords , in those shows ! To go through one , say the Sesquicentennial at Philadelphia , is to doubt whether a new Deluge is not needed to clean up the earth . But no , even in that wilderness of depravity there were bright spots , which is more than one can say of exhibitions where the False Artist has full powers . A committee of art-lovers , not necessarily the most enlightened even , will try to give a certain balance to an exhibition , letting it appeal to the " modern " - as well as the " old-fashioned " public . And good showmen have found out that the modern things draw the crowd ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Academy in New York in 1927 . It requested the participation of a large group of the artists who had for years abstained from showing their work at its exhibitions . All formalities of a X185 // choice by jury were waived , and a special room was reserved for the newcomers , many of whom had never submitted work at the galleries . The affair was mainly significant of the realization by the academies that they must make some change in their offering . Relatively few dealers in the big cities try any longer to sell such puerile wares as those which make up the bulk of the great annual exhibitions . It is becoming plain to too large a public that the trouble with those 39,900 artists in Paris and their innumerable counterparts elsewhere is simply incompetence ? in execution or in conception . Ask any dealer about the pictures by the idols of forty years ago , the " champions of the classics , " a euphemism commonly applied in the past to men like Cabanel and Knaus ; you will hear a tale of disappointment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of their share of the stuff long before ? but the disappointment of people who had thought their possessions of value , and then found them worthless . " But my father paid a big price for the picture to one of the most reputable houses in Paris ! " " I 'm sorry , madam , but it is n't the character of work I handle at my gallery . You might try the firm it came from , but I think it would be better to write them before sending the picture ; that may save you . ( z86 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST expense " ? and another person goes home to tell of the heartless commercialism of the present day . Why should the lady have expected anything else ? People are not in business " for their health , " especially with Fifth Avenue rents hanging over their heads . And yet , if she knew the history of the art-dealers , she might alter her idea of their being mere moneygrubbers . To be sure , there are those who look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of trade . There are also the men , and not too few , who have told the public things they themselves believed to be untrue about the quality of their stuff . How can you sell goods if you do n't say they 're fine ? But there arc too many others to allow the merely venal ones to constitute the rule . And when we come to certain men , we can only think what a vindication of human nature they are , seeing how they have refused to go " the easiest way " in a business that knows the immense uncertainties and difficulties of their own . The " art patron " whose house is such a temple of culture is often the most industrious of shoppers , the hardest of buyers ? and the most wavering of judges . Once the picture is on his walls , the same man ( who does not represent all collectors ) is a lion of courage , albeit with the modesty X187 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST becoming one who assumes no credit for the gift which permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dealer could tell a different story about that gift , and how it had to be propped up by his arguments , and how he or a colleague could have swung the quality of the collection into quite another course . America , and indeed Europe , do not know their debt to the galleries that , year in and year out , have been directing attention to a better kind of art . As the business became more organized and the public realized more clearly which men in it told the truth , the decrease in the numbers of forgeries was only the more obvious sign of improvement . There is a deeper kind of honesty than that which refuses to sell " Old Masters " of recent fabrication , or even that which will not close its eyes to evidence indicating that only a minor artist did the work which was at first attributed to a great man , the head of his school . The really conscientious dealer studies the quality of the art in the various kinds of goods possible to deal in successfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession has had a great example in one firm which , for a century and a quarter , has had not merely business rectitude as its principle , but conviction as to the art in what it offered . Compromise ? the thing the artist can not afford ? is sometimes im188 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST posed by conditions in a trade ; yet by keeping off the reefs of disaster through conservative investment in accepted things , it was possible for the house in question to offer its hospitality to the men whose work was at first difficult to sell . What a long past one caught a glimpse of in hearing the old head of the firm tell of the time when Millet , pressed by the needs of a growing family , would drop in at the end of a day to see how much ready cash was in the drawer ? and would receive all that the dealer could spare ! From the days of Barbizon to the end of the nineteenth century and beyond , the tale was the same : belief that time would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of Ananias ? if it is a choice , and not simply the result of circumstance . If we look back over the changes of art in America , we see how strong the hold of circumstance really is . When George Inness was approaching his personal style , just before the Civil War , landscape painting was pretty well in the cramped hold of the " omnibus school " of the older artists , whose decalcomania trees were continued for a while on the panels of the horsedrawn vehicles , and as they still are on the decorations of safes . The strong imagination of Inness broke away more and more from this tightness , which a Thomas Cole , with all his fantasy , could not abolish . A new conception again was brought in by Chase , . 189 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST Weir , and the others who made people aware of the light and atmosphere of Velasquez , while John La Farge , with his French cousins and friends , his wide knowledge of the past , his eclecticism , and his travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings as well as by his paintings , to push back the horizon for his countrymen . So it was also with the pioneers of Impressionism and the later schools ; the influence of Maurice B. Prendergast is not alone to be measured in terms of his beautiful vision and his color : one needs to hear what the continual references to Cezanne in his conversation meant to the Americans who knew him abroad and , later , at home . With each new change in conditions , in the seeing of the artist 's problem , there were certain men who remained " old school " ; but these retardataires are not for an instant to be confused with the decendants or even the victims of Ananias . Minor artists , as a rule , for the strong men ? if not too old ? would be willing to risk disaster to their sales or indeed their style by adopting new-found aspects of the truth , their work has its own value , if often a modest one ; and it were certainly only the most priggish connoisseur who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a big one . Perhaps this statement will seem to contradict the rigor which estimated the number of true artists today as so low ; let the visitor to the exhibitions see how long it takes to find enough 190 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST talents of real value to add up to a hundred : the figure will look harder to reach than when we compare it with 40,000 . And it was not the modest but genuine talents that were favored by the juries of the exhibitions . Those watchers at the gate were there to defend a system , and the record of their activity is to be read in the names of the great men whom they rejected . Sometimes an artist will take offense at rejections , and , after a time , exposes his work to them no more . That was the case of Delacroix , who , in the last and most glorious years of his life , refused to send his works to the Salon , as a rebuke for its injustice . Already in 1848 , Ingres , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report condemning the jury system and demanding its abolition . " A jury , however constituted , " his report continued , " will always function badly . I consider it unjust and immoral to deprive any man of the chance to make a living from his work , as long as he does not attack morality . " The juries , by excluding men from the exhibitions because of the tendency of their pictures as art , were depriving them of the main chance of reaching the public , of selling their work , and of communicating their ideas . Despite increasingly ample proof of the clearsighted wisdom of the old Classicist , it was not until 1884 that the Salon of the Independents " based on 1 191 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST the suppression of juries and of prizes , " was instituted . Anyone could exhibit , even Ananias ( and he did ) ; for the new " anarchists " were in earnest in accepting the principle of Voltaire : " I wholly disapprove of what you say , and will defend to the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Independents found a response in every country , and the forty-odd years covered by the movement are those which witnessed the great development of new talent ? and also the main increase in the census of artists , till it attained its staggering proportions of today . Perhaps a new period is beginning , when corporate control can be exercised over the excesses of the frankly mercenary men and the too ill-trained or merely silly exhibitionists , and yet not cause a relapse into the insincerity and incompetence of the old juries . Or for a while longer , perhaps , the words of Ingres will still have to be the guide : " We must learn to accommodate ourselves to freedom , whatever may be its drawbacks . " At all events , the public of today is demanding pictures that are not merely merchandise ; though enough of that type are still to be seen in the galleries of contemporary work , as well as those of the older schools . In the big cities that see the better kind of art , the day for the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ananias are concentrating on shows sent out to the newer communities , 4 191 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST where the organizing and advertising abilities of these dealers are said to be obtaining a considerable measure of success for their precious wares . Patience ; with time . But even if one has never seen one 's fellow-mortals in the regions of Illinois or Georgia or Texas favored by the new salesmen , one is too sure that they are nice people to be content with saying it will all come out right in a hundred years . Art is long , but that is no reason why we should be misled about it for one more day . As the more enlightened public grows in appreciation , through opportunity to know the true arts , more knowledge of them and care for them develop also among the dealers . The expertise of the old bric-abrac man who could interpret the marks on porcelain or silver is not enough to prepare the dealer of today for success . His judgment on periods and authenticity must he as exact as that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , a love for the art he deals in , which is the quality imitated for commercial purposes by those more than tiresome salesmen whose emotions seems always to have them on the verge of tears over the beauty they have nurtured in their bosoms . It is not merely against the counterfeit of art in the hands of the False Artists that the dealer of today must be on his guard . Among his neighbors ? perhaps right next door to his gallery ? are people who would ' 193 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST treat the art-business as if it were an application of the dressmaker 's ideas to the walls of the house . This picture just fits the space over your mantelpiece ; or perhaps you would like something a size smaller ? the best people are having less and less on their walls nowadays . Now here is one that would make a perfectly lovely spot in the room ; I should have thought a bit of velvet would have been richer , but if you really want a picture , I 'm sure this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just could n't bear it ; the period is quite different , and think how you would have to go up close ; in case you ever wanted to look at it . Besides , it would n't match the window-curtains at all . " Anita Loos has given a perfectly characterized , full-length portrait of this type of artist . It is in the words addressed to the French lawyer by the immortal Dorothy , whose sweetness makes one fall as " madly in love " with her as do the policemen . The sentence should be inscribed in letters of gold on the walls of certain interior decorators : " Louis , if you kiss Robert so often people will think you paint batiks . " As Ananias 's traveling salesmen are reaping a harvest in the towns new to an acquaintance with pictures , so the batik-boys are having their day with the " culturenes " of the big cities . " You speak of artcollectors as if there were more than a handful of 4 194 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST them in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that that 's all there is ? the rest of the buyers are j Est doing a refined sort of house-furnishing . " Which does not mean , of course , that pictures are the only form of art ; and doubtless the Rembrandt etching could not be well appreciated high up on a wall ; it might better be in a cabinet , like the exquisite small objects that the collector brings out in quiet moments , for himself or for guests to hold lovingly under the light that will best reveal them . Still , people who care for the works themselves have a mysterious way of finding places for them , even in a modern apartment . And when a great painting or sculpture is rejected because it " does n't fit the scheme of our interior , " we are no far cry from the case ( every bookseller will vouch for its being a real one ? and less infrequent than might be supposed ) of the person who comes with a bit of red or purple material and asks for bindings to match it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches of books like that . " It is less of an insult to the Muse of Reading to have those panels which simulate the backs of volumes ? the wall remaining undisturbed in the " library . " The man who invented that marvel ? sometimes executed with real taste ? was the ancestor of the modern interior decorators . Reversing the grand Latin words , their motto is " Non esse sed videri. " 195 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST v But coming back to art , which we are constantly losing from view in our travels with Ananias , it can never proceed on the above principle ; not what seems but what is constitutes its sole interest . There is a magnified example of the contrary of this to be had when one looks at the art of present-day Japan ? and thinks what it was before the people knew the influence of Europe . Right down to the epoch of Meiji , when Western ideas began to be imported wholesale , the old craftsmen continued their traditions , something of the old pictorial genius still lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as travelers of sixty years ago , or even less , have told . But as the country became more and more aware of the need of Occidental science , business methods , and war implements , in order to meet new conditions , an absurd , if natural , logic carried their national art as much out of fashion as their older material equipment . Westernizing was the great word , and Japanese art students appeared in the schools of Europe and America , while painters from the Occident ? usually pretty poor ones ? were employed to increase the feverish rate at which the new ideas were acquired . Behold the result ? in a succession of " styles " that have flooded the country with pictures which are the most perfect demonstration one could have that art X196 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST comes from within ? or it is non-art . The dislike of the Japanese for being " other than expected , " as one of their expressions has it , and their marvelous talent for imitation , have given to their most noted representative in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the Italian primitives ? gold backgrounds , cracks , thin-faced Madonnas , patina and all ? then was " modern " up to the hilt , then Rousseau-le-Douanier till you had to look at the signature to make sure it was not really by the old gentleman , and later , when the painter learned that originality was the real thing , a salad of all the ingredients . Another Japanese in Paris makes " African " wood-sculptures that have fooled all but the keenest experts ( also some people who thought themselves experts ) . A Japanese restorer of old sculpture said to a dealer , " Sometimes you have me put a hand on a statue that has lost it , sometimes a foot , sometimes a nose or an entire head . Why do you go and spend all that money for pieces of statues , that I complete ? Give me half the price and I will make the whole thing ? just as nice as the old ones and with all the mellowness of age . " ( The English used to report the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by much frequenting of art-writers and art-talkers , but the sense of the restorer 's offer is rendered without the slightest change of any other kind. ) , ' ( 197 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST Of course such candid innocence as his takes him , and those like him , entirely away from the neighborhood of Ananias . They furnish the most perfect , because unconscious , satire on the European and American artists and their fancy-dress balls , known as art-exhibitions , where one person comes with a Velasquez make-up , another masquerades as a Greek , a third as Picasso , a fourth as a photographer , and so you have tout lc bazar , not omitting the people who have discovered the success of the American Indian , and paint things in the style of the Hopi , more or less . Is it necessary to say that all contemporary Japanese work is not like that of the three men described above ? Since there are people who think that the mention of a bad example means wholesale condemnation , perhaps it will be wiser to specify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strong minds searching for an issue from the present dilemma . There is no turning back from the ideas that Europe has given , but the national genius is too precious ? and too vigorous ? to be lost . The thousands of readers of Okakura Kakuzo 's books know how well he understood the thought of both the races . From the lecture heard twenty-five years ago a phrase of his that has perhaps escaped print heretofore , stands out in memory ? " Rembrandt 's orchestration of the shadows . " It was spoken a few days after he // had attended a Wagner opera , and is only one more example of his felicity in seizing the essence of Western culture . But perhaps the most striking example of it was given on the day of his visit to the Autumn Salon in Paris , when , after going about entirely alone and studying the modern works , ( which were new to him ) , he said that he had discovered some paintings whose art he felt to be beautiful in the sense established by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the painter , which he said was Matisse . Not only the critic who interpreted the West to the East and the East to the West , but Japanese painters and sculptors point to a solution of their country 's problem . " It is strange , " said Moriye Ogihara one day , " at the Louvre I kept thinking of those grand landscapes of Cezanne when I was looking at the Ruisdaels ; and now , at this Cezanne exhibition , my mind is always going back to the things of the old Italians at the Louvre . " Such penetration into European art was even more important when he worked at his sculpture , for he saw beyond the surface , there , too , and decided , in his calm and positive way , on the possibilities open to one of his ancestry . When news came of his untimely death , Rodin grieved over the loss of a pupil whom he regarded as a great man ; and the artists of Ogihara 's native land knew that the few years after his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARTIST works which meant that Japan could express her own ideas in the Western forms . There is reason to hope that the present-day painting of Toshi Shimizu , coming home after his years in America and in France , may add to that conviction , and other men are certainly continuing the story . The explanation that my attack on certain Japanese did not involve the whole people was at least the occasion of bringing some rays of hope into what may seem the darkness of this book . Let me , therefore , explain some more : the False Artist is not a limb of Satan , separated from the True Artist in the cleancut way that the old Sunday-school books differentiated between the two little boys in the fables . In their totality , the counterfeit things point away from the true ones as diametrically as the two monstrous little paragons of vice and virtue were opposed , but when one is faced with individual artists or works , the difference may not appear so complete . And in the strictures of these pages , more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dictated the conception of a pogrom picture in a New York exhibition a few years ago . Some artist , brooding on the horrors he had seen ? or read about ? more probably ? had painted a ghastly incident of torture , with a fiendish personage gloating over the cruelty . " What does that represent ? " inquired a small boy of John Sloan , who happened to be stand // ing near by . " Everybody 's idea of the enemy , " was the instant reply . This time it is myself I must try to extricate from an arraignment . If I have painted False Artists as black all over and have not spoken before of the remarkable qualities of the more accomplished ones among them , it is because I was assuming that everyone gave to Gerome such credit as he deserves for his conscientious working out of detail ; that no one doubted that Leon Bonnat produced " honest photographs " as Elie Faure calls them , and that Besnard was entitled to the admiration of one of his colleagues , who called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided one understand thereby the ability to use the hand and the lesser functions of the mind . The Alma-Tadema , perhaps the sillest picture in this book , and the Stuck , perhaps the most atrocious one , are performances due to ability such as no other artist in their time possessed . But after all deductions from the account are allowed , the reckoning must show that such men are of the class who have failed to give with the full hand of the artist ; and so they incur the penalty paid by Ananias . Their work is dead work . That they tower above the little men of their school seems so obvious that it is only on this late page that it occurs to me to say so . Will the reader make a last pious distinction , while I myself drain 20 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST my ecclesiastical style to the dregs , by repeating once more the words , " Not failure but low aim is crime " ? If I am to be bastinadoed for saying these obvious things , perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Senator Hoar when he , on the contrary , took too much for granted . Reading aloud to his family the manuscript of his autobiography , he had just finished the pages covering the time of the Civil War , when an excited little voice piped up , " But , Grandpapa , did n't anybody help you to put down the Rebellion ? " VI I hope that good Yankee story has not been repeated to too many readers of these pages who , like myself , have failed to go to the original source of it . First-hand testimony is always the best , and I can again speak of things I have seen , in telling about a country whose example forms a pendant to that of Japan . Returning to the question of the role that circumstance plays in determining the character of a people 's art , that of the Mexicans is , in some ways , more a product of conflicting influences than that of the Japanese . But in the land of our southern neighbors , there was not the long isolation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the Orient . Instead , Mexico has known invasions 1202 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST from immemorial times . The savage tribes from the north came down over the country in successive waves , destroying what they could , then learning from the earlier and more civilized peoples they had conquered ? and finally settling down to be Mexicans , in the sense of the word which denotes the boundaries of the present republic . To this day , each region , each town even , has the special character deriving from its old inhabitants . The Spanish invasion , with all its importance , does not seem so vast an event if we consider that the past of the country covers some thousands of years , and if we notice that the Mexican faculty for absorbing alien races , physically and spiritually , made the descendants of the men of Cones and his successors into real Americans , a people of the New World , that is , and very different from the Spaniards . Mexican art has expressed the mind of this people throughout the changes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers and leaves remained the same and were always loved . They go into the countless art-products of the people wherein color is the thing that gives delight . One sees this color sense of the Mexican again in his use of the tezontle , the wine-red volcanic stone of which the great houses are built , and in the clear tones with which the houses of the poor are painted . It made relatively little difference whether an Aztec emperor , a Spanish viceroy , or a 1 203 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST republican president directed the government , whether the warrior shot with bow and arrow or with a modern rifle : the volcanoes still looked down on the old capital , the pyramids of the ancestors still rose in proud response to the line of the mountains , and the monumental forms continued in the work of the sculptors who told of the mystery of the serpent , the courage of the jaguar , the humor of the monkey , and the spirit of the quetzal ? the most beautiful of birds , which dies when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above all there are men and women . The millions of little earthen sculptures of heads that the soil contains , like the grand figures in stone , tell of people whose life was essentially that of today . They fought and prayed , they had music and poetry , they loved and they brought forth children . What was changed ? Not the need of an art to put all this into lines and colors that last , while the forms of the world waver in their indecision and pass away . They are good forms , but we did not make them , said the old Mexicans ; let us love them ? and make our own forms . Mexican art contains a thousand things that have reminded travelers of the great creations of Egypt , but not one thing that could remind them of the art-school figures that Mr. French offers in contrast with the symbol of Egypt . The secret of the Sphynx is no secret to any Mexican who has looked at the old sculptures of his country ? and every 2-04 ANANIAS OR THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a secret told by men who render things not as they seem , but as they are . Therefore Juanita and Miguelito do not understand the counterfeit of art when it is brought from Europe or the United States . Alas for us that sometimes it should be spoken of by them as " Gringo art " ! They stare " stupidly " at the naturalistic pictures , wondering why people make such things ( which are not more comprehensible if they happen to be the work of Mexicans who have learned to perform these tricks ? but who do not produce Mexican art ) . It is , however , in the most vigorous fashion that the people respond to the frescoes that Rivera and Orozco have painted on the walls of public buildings . They are " mucho inuy Mexicanos " in telling about the same old fighting and praying and all the rest of the things that their ancestors knew . ( More propaganda for modernism , I shall be told , Rivera having been a Cubist or , as he says , being one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible world ; and look at Orozco with his head full of mathematics ? and all sorts of revolutionary stuff ! ) The former of these two artists is already known and admired in the United States ; when we know more of Orozco it seems certain that we shall add his name to the roll of the great men of our time . Mexicans are not afraid of modernism , whether in ' 2OS . ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST the fine arts or the applied arts , any more than they are afraid of being old-fashioned when they have on the bed a blanket whose fine pattern dates from centuries ago , or on the table a gayly painted lacquer box that they learned to make after their contact with Chinese art . Here we see things , and get rid of words . What does it matter if art is modern or ancient , fine or applied ? What matters is the question of art or the counterfeit of it . And no Mexican ever says " Gringo art " about certain ones among our products ? perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . " Look what I bought today , " said Don D. , pulling out a .45 caliber revolver and offering it for the inspection of his young wife . " Oh , how pretty ! " was the delighted comment . And it did not leap forth so spontaneously from the charming lady because of the business ability of that raw shooting-iron ; it was because of the clean , logical surfaces , the strong , elegant lines , the really architectural quality of the thing . If the man in Connecticut who made it had put on some aesthetic decoration , as his neighbor puts near-Greek acanthus designs in gold paint on the wheel of a sewing-machine , the logic of the thing would have been marred , and the lady would have disliked it . In its natural beauty , it was to her mind a becoming attribute for a man , just as a bit of lace was nice for herself . The same vegetable-seller who drops in at the mu zo6 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST scum for twenty minutes , on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out after looking at the old masks there , and stand in silent admiration before an automobile . Its gleaming black enamel has something of the texture of the obsidian in which the sculptors worked , and the reflections in the sides of the modern wonder are not unlike the depths into which he seemed to look as he peered , with the eye of a connoisseur , at those carved fragments of volcanic glass . The old artists had taken a bit of the formlessness of nature and given it a meaning , the modern artists had used their materials with the same relish for quality , and the same pride in giving the world something it had not had before . Doubtless the day will come , though not for a long time , when the need for the special type of workmen who produce the automobile will have passed away , and then when we can no longer make such things , we shall have a different appreciation of their beauty . We now prize fragments of metal or wood or stone , perhaps a tenmillionth part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic Europe , and which were used as roughly as we use our special possessions . You may object that the automobile factories run on a modern kind of slave-labor , not artist-labor . Doubtless there are , indeed , many factory departments in which the men think as little as does the machine ; but was there not , also , much merely physi-4107 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST cal drudgery in building the cathedrals ? Yet the toiler who set the stones or made the glass had his sense of sharing in the triumph , as well as the artist of the time , who was only another workman himself , and who surely did far more than what one catalogues under the heading of pure aesthetics . So , too , the pride in intelligent labor probably begins much further down in the scale of modern industry than we might at first imagine . No other explanation seems possible for the marvels that are being produced . The airplane ! There is a thing to stir our Mexican . The pivotal discovery of using a geometrical element , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hovering and soaring of birds , and the intensity which went into that observation was the same employed by Leonardo , to mention him again , whether in the study through which he anticipated the airplane itself , or in his notation of muscles , insects , plants , etc. , or in a sublimation of his whole genius in a work like the St. Jerome , or the Adoration of the Magi . The simple man whom we have just seen staring at the sculpture of the Aztecs and Toltecs in his museum , was also beholding the new product formed when nature is comprehended ( not merely copied ) by the mind of man . And so there is no change in the quality of his thought , as he looks up in crossing the green patio of the museum and sees , Zo8 ANANIAS OR TIlE FALSE ARTIST in the clear air over his mountains , a steadily moving spot of silver against the blue of the sky . The faint whir of the machine which reaches his ear is not quite new to him , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been thinking about just before , when he saw , represented in the ancient works , the big ocean shells that were a symbol of the sea-god , because the droning sound they imprison is like that of the waters . Does a mere peasant know all this ? All this and more . The old people hand on the legends to the young ; and besides , there is the museum , where things are not only beautiful but real , living . In Mexico there is more that melts into the void than the idle words used by the xsthetes to divide up , as ancient or modern , the indivisible force called art . The distinctions we make among all great human achievements disappear . In the museum , before the ancient miracles in stone , the son of the race that wrought them felt the power of genius ; seeing the airplane , he felt the same power again . That is why in this country , where art and life are so close , the great tact and sympathy of Colonel Lindbergh caused him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from any he had ever received before . Such American intervention as his ? the only kind worthy of us ? is understood by the people who have so many times known invasion from without , and always gained new values from it . That is the ' 1 2.09 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST process also by which the artist can transmute sensation into those new values which he creates . If we would offer a true monument to the Mexican aviator who returned the visit of Lindbergh , it must be by appreciating the racial genius which directed the life of Emilio Carranza ? and that of Alvaro Obregon . That genius understood the spirit of the United States , sometimes called modern , to be as timeless as the art of the old Mexicans ; we can not fail to respond in kind to their appreciation . We shall do so when we realize that the course of all our past achievement , and that which we aspire to , is charted in the " mental thing " of the Museum . Ito CHAPTER V THE MARINER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that I can present fully the apologia pro libro ineo ? and even my poor recollections of schoolboy Latin tell me that those words mean something quite different from an apology for this book . Yet explanation may not be out of place after using the name of Ananias to designate the type of the False Artist . In my foreword I spoke of him as a victim of bad training and I have since attempted to show the effect of circumstance on the minds of men at certain times . The men of the fifteenth century were not more " good " than those of the nineteenth century ; it was the difference in conditions that caused the work of the Renaissance artists to be art in the majority of cases , and the work of the modern men to be the counterfeit of art in perhaps the same proportion . Those who pushed on against the backward sweep of the tide were among 4 2II ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST the real heroes of human effort , and it is impossible to condemn utterly those who were dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader will be indulgent toward a last attempt to show reason for an attack on men who , with time ( to use the pregnant phrase once more ) , will be forgotten . Things only come out right in a hundred years if people have been working aright for the ninety-nine years before , because the relation of cause and effect is not a matter of fits and starts , but is steady and cumulative . The things in the Museum were not made in a day . " Do you demand 200 guineas for the work of a few hours ? " as Whistler was asked in the famous lawsuit about his picture . " No , sir , for the study of a lifetime . " All the long past of the artists , or indeed the race , goes into the things of the Museum , and they show us the course we must travel as well as that over which we have come . The Museum is the mariner 's compass by which we steer , in far more important measure than it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead as dead ; as long as men are living the dead will live , " said van Gogh ? who had a right to the ecclesiastical style , since he had studied to be a minister . Those callow boys , the Futurists , who shook their fists at the Museum and talked ( metaphorically ) about the need to destroy it , in order to keep tourists from treating Italy as a land of the past , were 4 2 . I2 ANA ? NIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST promptly laughed out of court for their pains . And their summary rejection was not the work of M. Leon Bonnat , for the thunderbolts he hurled against them had missed fire too often , when he had directed them against the great artists of his time . It needed the adverse judgment of the " modern " men to refute the idea that the Museum is a sort of valley of dead bones . A recently founded institution of great interest is called " The Gallery of Living Art . " But why the distinction ? Because the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title does not say that . The things of an Egyptian or a Gothic gallery are at least as much living art . Century after century the magnetic force in them has swung the point of the compass in the same direction ; they are not inert , but alive , in every sense but the physical one . The old stories tell that when Donatello had done a certain bust which is particularly life-like , he tapped it on the shoulder and said , " Speak " ; and that , referring to this , Michael Angelo said to one of his figures , " Walk . " The words have been taken by a few people to mean that the sculptors looked on their work as real men , in all but speech and action , and that their words counsel the artist to strive to equal nature . Count Gobineau has fun with the idea in his wonderful book on the Renaissance . It is in that dialogue between Titian and Aretino wherein the latter , hav4 213 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST ing goaded the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his drawing , gets Titian to burst forth with the defense : " I draw as well as nature herself ! " " Very true , master , and the world can contain no one so base as to deny it , " replies the poet ; and then throwing aside his mask of humility " ? but the trouble is that you do not draw better than nature . " Whether the angry speech attributed to Titian has any historical basis or not , the words of the two great sculptors recalled just previously , and which have come down to us from old sources , certainly indicate that the artists of the time could , in their speech at least , give to their work a function which has now been fulfilled by the cinematograph , where the figures really move , and have lately been supplemented by a mechanism through which their voices are heard . But no one thinks that this is the kind of moving , talking , and " nature " referred to by the three masters . Aretino , scamp though he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the old artist that his boast of equaling nature was rubbish . The painter 's expression is given with his brush ; when lured into controversy by a crafty manipulator of words , even a Titian may have gotten himself into the untenable position which his tormentor gleefully exposed with such devastating effect . Most artists know the danger , and Titian himself employed 1214 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST Aretino to do the talking for him in his bickerings with critics and patrons . Today he needs no defenders but his painting ; a simple reproduction like the Venus in this book would refute the idiocy of a hundred would-be-arbiters like the " Petronius " who assumes the title in his campaign against the " modernists . " His attack on the Titian is mere preparation for assailing Degas , " a page or two later , and his constant effort is to link the modern men with Bolshevism . But questions of painting are not decided by words , and are scarcely affected by epithets ; the last thing to do here would be to answer the arraignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the object of what the " Arbiter " doubtless regards as criticism . If the work of those artists is bad , people will see it as that ; if it is good it will continue to gain in favor ; and the main importance of exhibitions , art magazines and books lies in the opportunity afforded to the work , or reproductions of it , to come before the tribunal of public opinion . ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST When it appears there the picture or the statue moves and speaks in a different way from the one intended in the joke of the two great artists of the Renaissance : all through the centuries the world has been listening to the essential words of the masters ? those contained in their work . Take even the most rapid walk through the museum , and one clear fact stands out : that the later arts follow the earlier ones in character as inevitably as the years follow one another in time . That fatherto-son relationship of the masters , however , does not mean that they take the mathematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a zigzag , a century either continuing the tendency of the one before it , as the eighteenth goes in a direction established by the seventeenth , or it may follow as a reaction against previous tendencies as , after the French Revolution , the nineteenth century sets its face against what the Dix-huitiere held to be wise and charming . Yet the seeds of the whole modern development are to be found in the past , and critics have pointed out at various times that Renoir takes us back to the naturalness and grace of that very eighteenth century against which his own started out in a revolt . Being a man of what I have called elsewhere the period of consciousness , it is natural to find him quite aware of the direction of his art , and corroborating it by his words , those deep and lovable words in the conversa- ( zz6 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST tions with Vollard and others previously cited , as in the passage about Corot and the painters of Pompeii . It was by no accident , and still less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteenth-century work as the most beautiful picture in the world ? Watteau 's Embarkation for Cythera . And if the more or less apocryphal sayings of the older masters quoted before seemed to point to a conclusion that it is wiser for the artist to refrain from speech , I return to a point touched on earlier , and repeat that our fuller and more exact knowledge of the facts in modern instances permits us to say that the words of the great painters and sculptors only confirm the ideas expressed in their work . We know the opinions of almost all of them in the nineteenth century ? in a large number of cases from writings they have left . Those of the man who may well be the greatest of all the moderns , Delacroix , amount to a number of volumes . The body of testimony in words is of course most valuable , indeed the most authoritative of all spoken or written criticism . Yet it is not for an instant to be compared to the testimony in the work of the masters ' hands . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , even more , decided their character , by drawing from the frescoes of Masaccio , we have an illustration ( and there are a thousand such ) , of the way that the essential ideas // of the great artists are transmitted to the later time . To know these ideas , the modern public goes to the museum . It is therefore of absolutely crucial importance that what we place there be worthy of its place ; for judgments are rendered , standards are established for innumerable people by what is offered to them as the result of the ripest consideration . The layman may eventually come to distinguish between true and false in the modern work at the museum , but the chances are that he will be caught by the " easily understood " pictures , such as are shown in this book , and never move on to comprehension of the great things . n In presenting a certain defense for the victims of Ananias , I perhaps exaggerated a little . They had the Museum as their guide , quite as much as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , as when one sees the marvelous drawings that Ingres made as a child , or when one thinks of Delacroix painting the Dante and Vergil at the age of twenty-three , one is tempted to believe in predestination , to say that Fate determined that these men should go their noble way and that the False Artists likewise should go their own . Philosophers may gather data for both sides in the old controversy here-4218 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST with connected . If the example of the two great men of a hundred years ago is an argument for necessary consequences of given conditions , the partisans of free will in our lives may point to other cases where artists have dominated circumstance , changing from the direction they took after a bad start , raising the quality of their work , and doing this not so much by achieving better execution as by arriving at a finer conception . William M. Chase used to observe that if Rembrandt had died after painting The Anatomy Lesson , the world would never have known the profound genius with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless to be connected with the outer events of his life , the death of Saskia and of his children , the loss of his early prosperity , and his refuge , during the later years , in the Ghetto , with its color , its sorrows , its philosophers , its life ? so much more poignantly real than that of the comfortable merchants he had frequented before . We can not hope to know the cause of Rembrandt 's rise to his final grandeur , but if we take note that other men 's lives have known the light and the shadow of his own , we are at least directed elsewhere for our explanation . What was the occasion for the break in his fortunes ? We know that it came when he began to head toward his deeper idea of picture-making . The Night Watch was the great turning-point in his 4 219 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST course , and , as we know , the canvas was rejected by his contemporaries . It is at about that time also that we see in his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had been accumulating sketches of theirs , he had copied those precious documents and made variants of them , such marvelous ones , that we have to study them closely in order to become aware that they are not his original work . Mantegna and Leonardo and Mixer were pondered by him ; Raphael 's Baldassare Castiglione was hastily noted down in a drawing when the masterpiece appeared in an auction in Amsterdam , and such Persian miniatures as he could see were eagerly seized upon for the glimpse they afforded of the art of the Orient . It is impossible to avoid the conviction that the master 's continued meditating of all these works and others , ( which were for him the equivalent of the Museum in our time ) , influenced his later painting quite as much as did his environment or the events of his life . And if these matters be regarded as the things independent of his will , his study of the arts of the Museum is surely to be reckoned as evidence of his determination to widen the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepened . Everything brings us back to that great institution where the chart of our course is traced . The example of Rembrandt is beyond refutation in giving the lie to those who would say that the mariner 's compass , 220 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST which I have imagined as the symbol of the Museum , points only to the past . For weaklings who look on art as an escape from life , the Museum may indeed offer a means of daydreaming themselves into a golden age where they forget actualities . But for the strong man it is not merely a gateway to enchanted fields , it is life itself , in an epitome to which no other that we have can be compared . It does contain the past ; and the present also , if we are alive to it ; but above all , if we look closely enough , it contains the future . When we see a Napoleon giving his passionate study to the campaigns of Cesar and Turenne , when we read that Joffre and Foch analyzed so deeply the generalship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that they take an " archeological " interest in those things of the past : it was , in the case of that genius of a hundred years ago , in order to draw the stupendous design of his own operations ; just as , in our day , it was to evolve the " sublime strategy " of the victory at the Marne . Again , as we did in Mexico , we see the oneness of human genius , however different its manifestations . No one who has had the privilege of listening to Marshal Joffre will ever forget the thrill of hearing the steady voice of the master tell of the survival of France , and say that the reasons for it are written in the art of the country . He was addressing a group of American students of art-history at the Louvre , to inaugurate the school which 2.11 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST New York University was founding there , and he said , You will study the stones of our cathedrals , and the statues and the glass and the pictures of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our past and of our present . " More than the military man , more perhaps than the worker in any other field , the painter or sculptor bases his action on the teachings of the classics . Those secrets , which the old hero spoke of to his hearers from the younger country , are open to the man who will look into the great works with sufficient intelligence and faith . Always the same themselves , the principles of art always lead to new results when they are invoked in dealing with the new problems of the surrounding world . The essential failure of the False Artist comes because he does not approach the masters in their own spirit . They turned the whole of their possessions into the values which they gave to their fellows so that ? in the words of the old narrative ? there were none among them that lacked . But Ananias can not believe fully in values more important than those of his " lands or houses " and the esteem they mean for him with the crowd . He has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those which are centered entirely around material things , but he can not give these up completely . As long as the counterfeit of art is known for what it is , there is no reason to trouble about it , still less 122 . ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST to add to the punishment of individuals whose action , as we have seen , carries with it the loss of everything really precious to the artist . The question is different when we find the counterfeit entering the museums . If the mariner 's compass is rendered inaccurate in its indications , our whole course is falsified . The matter was never stated in more conclusive fashion than in the words of Renoir which MeierGraefe records in his book on the great painter . The German critic had been inquiring as to what , in the opinion of the old artist , was the decisive thing for the work of the student intent on becoming a good painter . " You would say that he should work his problem out by study of nature , would you not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monet and Cezanne , among his old comrades , had always talked of nature , and the word had a sort of halo around it , anyhow . But finally he determines to speak out : " No ; nature brings men to isolation . I want to stay in the ranks . " " But the schools being bad , as you have said , if it is not before nature , where is it that the young man becomes an artist ? " " Au inusee , parbleu ! " It was at the Museum that he himself had served his apprenticeship in the time-honored procedure of copying the masters , as Ingres , a few days before his 4 22-3 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST death at the age of eighty-seven , was still doing ; as Delacroix had done , with his profoundly analytical mind ; as the rough mountaineer Courbet did with his grandly heavy brush ; as Manet did with the eclecticism of his old culture ; as Degas did with his severely classical intelligence ; as Redon did in order to situate his world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great draftsmen ; as Seurat did to strengthen the scientific basis of his painting with the greater authority of art . All these men were the " moderns " of their respective periods , and what is more , all of them could make their intense use of the classics and yet retain their originality intact . Of course , no one would accuse Renoir of being unaware of the fact that artists of the greatest merit have studied at schools or under teachers or from nature . What he meant , as is quite clear , was that the deciding factor in the formation of an art is , after all , the influence ? direct or indirect ? of the classics we have heard him discuss before . The Museum has been the real teacher of all great men ? of the present and the past , even if it is powerless against the incapacity of little men . For the artist , the value of studying the masters does not reside in such knowledge of them as the arthistorian or critic possesses , nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the appreciative layman or collector derives from his visits to the 4 224 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST Museum . The artist 's study gives him , or strengthens in him the ability to apply the mental processes of the masters to his own problem . But whatever the category of persons who use the Museum , whatever the type of work they want to see there , there is one type that has no proper place on its walls , and that is the counterfeit . People will turn away from it in proportion to the quickness of their intelligence , in proportion , also , to their knowledge of what is real . No one gets any help from the false things ; they can cause only loss of time . This is above all true in a country like the United States , with its great openness of mind in respect to art ; its awareness of a limited preparation , and the eagerness of its public for authoritative guidance . Compare the situation of that public with what one finds in Europe : the intelligent young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old palace to give him an idea of architecture and its teachings as to proportion and style , perhaps a fountain of a good period with some sculptural figures , and , in the churches , some paintings , that tell him of the great tradition , even if in the hands of minor masters . What is there to tell the young American of the small cities , or even many large ones , of the immense and ancient force called art ? I have fallen into treating the Museum from a standpoint at least in part pedagogical ; but to make 225 l ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST amends even for that I should not think it needful to touch on the phase of its problem which has to do with its resources for giving pleasure if it were not for the curious words " museum fatigue " which have been appearing in certain quarters of late . It appears that visitors get tired when they go to the galleries ; and museum men are asked to take elaborate precautions to prevent the public from over-straining itself in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger is of its never returning to them . Of course everyone who looks at art objects knows that light is indispensable ; and good ventilation is desirable in every place . A proper presentation of the works adds much in facilitating enjoyment of them , and a masterpiece looks its best among other masterpieces related to it in character . But surely the concern about " museum fatigue " is a result of a too short acquaintance with the institution , whose pioneer example , the Louvre , is still less than a hundred and fifty years old . Doubtless whenever it was that collections of books accessible to the public were first instituted , people discovered that there was such a thing as library fatigue . The recipe for avoiding it is very simple , and involves neither a regime of digestives or soporifics , to counteract excesses . For the newer phenomenon of the museum , Alfred Stevens gave a similar prescription ? that one look at only a few pictures at a time . It takes quite a while to see them thoroughly , 4 226 ANANIAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are the galleries of sculpture , ceramics , etc. , to offer another fillip to the appetite . III If such words bring us near to suggestions of merely physical indulgence , let us hasten on to less frivolous thoughts . There is , for example , the commercial value of the Museum . We shall examine but one phase of it , though one that is very much to the fore at the present day ? the new enthusiasm for the decorative arts . For these the problem of the curator is mostly one of good taste and scholarship , and in this department the Museum itself comes near in character to the natural-history collection , where the ideal is to have a specimen of everything . We can not tell beforehand what types of work may be needed for consultation , so all should be there , whatever the preferences of those who do the assembling . They must deal mostly with the past , and very few objects , among those of the minor arts , have survived the judgment of time which are not genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection will be by the manufacturer who wants to make nothing more than machine reproductions . The Museum offers him every incentive to come and find out why his corn // petitors are cutting into his sales . He knows that he must improve his product , and perhaps he will be led to see that what he thought faithful copies of the old things really miss some indefinable but essential quality in them . At first he will say that you are talking aesthetics and telling him to make the river run uphill if you say he can charge more money for goods made in moderate quantity , when his past effort was always for cheapness ? a bigger output and lower prices than the other fellow . But he is willing to experiment , and when he understands better the beauty of the old things , he realizes that real workmanship and fine design are factors in his market which he had been neglecting . The workmanship of the machine age is bound to be different in some respects from that of the time of hand labor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his metal into plates become mere affectation on the part of the modern " artcrafter " who buys the plates all rolled out and buffed , and puts the hammer marks on his hand-wrought silver as its last touch of artistry . They are not quite in the class with the " artificial " wormholes which Ananias uses to prove the beauty of the furniture he is making today ; they are not meant to deceive , like the " fading colors of age " by which the False Artist , reduced to the industrial field , increases the price of certain modern textiles . ( Ask any tapestry restorer , by the i8 ANANIAS OR THE FALSE ARTIST way , about the color of the old things , which Ananias so beautifully calls the pallor of time . You will hear that the workman ravels out threads from bits of old tapestry and mends with them . The old dyes were chosen for permanence , and the repair would soon be visible if modern dye in the thread changed tone . ) When the old designer wanted silvery color he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used that also and got his harmony at the beginning , not with the smoke and dirt of the centuries . They are a poor substitute for talent . The fake hammer-strokes , wormholes and faded colors are as far , one as another , from any connection with the traditions that gave us the beautiful things in the museum . When , in his visits there , our manufacturer gets to making excursions outside the department that he thought the only one of importance to him , he begins also to form an idea of the other quality he was missing in his product . He had sensed the fineness of the workmanship in his models , and his men had taken to the idea of equaling it with an enthusiasm he had never seen in them before ? except when they were inventing new troubles for him at their labor union ( and they had been doing less of that lately ) . But every time he employed another designer from the art-school , even the one with all the prizes , he had come on just one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting part // of the problem of the decorative arts section of the Museum . More and more it must take up contemporary work . The deadly Victorian interiors we glanced at before represent a period of numbness which seems to be thawing out , though the torrential freshets of the first exhibitions of furniture , etc. , are bringing along stuff that is just as rubbishy , in its new style . Like the work of the modern Japanese , it is the result of adverse conditions . But , on the other hand , there are things which mean more than hope , which are actual achievements . And they are produced ( to repeat the words used previously about the good painters and sculptors at the museum ) , by applying the mental processes of the masters to the problem of the new time . The same genius that built the cathedral and made its statues went into the designing and carving of its choir stalls , and into the color of its glass . We can not copy those things : there is no copying in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , even if modern conditions have hindered new expressions of it . But look today at the fine painter , Raoul Dufy . He does a big panorama of Paris , and you feel his gusto as he followed the logic that drove the great line of the Champs Elysees from the Place de la Concorde to the Place de 1'Etoile . In his fascinating painting he tells how the builders of his city loved the winding of the Seine and so were inspired to line its 423o
