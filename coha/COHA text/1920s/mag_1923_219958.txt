Mr. Justice Sutherland was to have been entertained at dinner by the alumni of the Phi Delta Phi legal fraternity at the University Club in Washington . The dinner was cancelled at the last moment because the guests objected to the form of the invitations . Each invitation was issued in the form of a summons to which was appended a list of interrogatories dealing with the Volstead Law : " Have you a supply in your cellar or other place of concealment ? . . . How much do you intend to bring ? . . . Etc . " <P> Instead of acceptances , protests began to flow in . The authors of the invitation insisted that it was " only a joke " and not intended to be taken seriously , but the entertainment was cancelled and Justice Sutherland missed a dinner .
