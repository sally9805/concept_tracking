Radio listeners , being human , want the best of everything . But they do n't always get it . The nightly ether-music is too often indirect advertising . Prudent musicians object to the broadcasting of their programs ; people wo n't buy seats in stuffy concert halls if they can stay at home and listen to the same thing . For these and allied reasons , the Chicago Civic Opera will not broadcast its performances this Winter . <P> A solution to this distressing situation has been offered by the National Association of Broadcasters of New York . It is a plan that has already worked out successfully in England . Every piece of radio apparatus that is sold to the public is to be decorated with a stamp . These stamps are to represent one-half of 1% of the retail price of the apparatus . The purchaser pays the stamp tax as his contribution to the support of the " talent " he will hear . <P> It is expected that radio sales will approximate $400,000,000 during the current year . This would yield a stamp-income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of the announcement , " the best-known performers of the stage and concert platform . " The plan is recommended by a special committee appointed by E. F. McDonald , President of the Broadcasters ' Association . It was considered the best of over 100 submitted by various radio organizations . It will undoubtedly be adopted at the Broadcasters ' Annual Convention in September and will then come before Secretary Hoover , " Dictator of U. S. Radio , " when the National Radio Conference holds its grand powwow.
