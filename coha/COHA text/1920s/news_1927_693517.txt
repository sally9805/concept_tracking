txt Congress is to adjourn in less than four weeks and fear is expressed that , unless it takes action in that short period , the effort to prevent the architectural beauty of the White House from being spoiled by the erection of commercial buildings of various designs and heights around Lafayette Square will never be successful . A chance paragraph in the Public Building act of 1926 has tied the hands of the Public Building Commission in seeking to place handsome Government buildings of uniform design around three sides of the square , and thus giver a dignified and attractive setting to the White House , which faces the square on the south side . Through this paragraph the 25-yearold plan for the beautification of Washington , to which the Fine Arts Commission and other bodies have conformed in choosing sites for and determining the architecture of new Government buildings , is disarranged . The paragraph provides that Government buildings authorized in the Public Building act shall not be erected north of Pennsylania Avenue , on which the White House is situated . More than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidding any Government development whatever north of Pennsylvania Avenue . The Congressional Record issued today , which covers yesterday 's proceedings in Congress , contains the text of a statement of the Committee on Plan of Washington of the American Institute of Architects , a part of which already has been published . Plan Endorsed . " The plan for developing the capital , " says the statement . " has stood for twenty-five years . It is the logical interpretation of the original L'Enfant plan for the national capital . It has guided the Fine Arts Commission in its supervision of building development . " The plan called attention to the fact that the White House is one of our finest national monuments , but that it is a relatively modest , unpretentious structure in architectural mass , and could easily be dwarfed or rendered insignificant if thrown into sharp contrast with large buildings . " The plan also called attention to the fact that the future main approach to Washington from the north Will be via Sixteenth Street . It provided for both conditions by enframins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ss , low enough to respect the White House , imposing enough to give an adequate first impression to the " For twentv-five years the general acceptance of this plan has prevented exploitation of the White House district . Two large commercial buildings have been erected  --  one by the Government . In 1925 the Carlton Hotel was scheduled for the corner of Sixteenth and H Streets , but the promoter was induced to build elsewhere . Two structures were launched in accordance with the general plan , one the Chamber of Commerce , the other the Treasury Annex . Blanket Protection Removed . " In 1926 , at the end of the last session of Congress , and over the protests of all professional planning groups , an amendment was forced on the Public Building bill to eliminate areas north of Pennsylvania Avenue from Government development . This removed the blanket protection of the plan , and immediately the results were evident . The historic residences at Sixteenth and H Streets are being demolished and will be replaced by an apartment hotel , and plans are out for a commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the square . " As matters now stand , the future holds this result : " The Treasury Annex , which must eventually be completed , giving an imposing monumental structure , will extend across the east side of the square . The west side will be tall commercial office buildings . The north side will show one monumental semipublic structure , one apartment hotel , one church , one commercial office building ( Government-owned ) and one private residence , possibly to be replaced by some sixth type . " The institute committee 's statement characterized this architectural arrangement as " hodgepodge " and declared that Lafayette Square 's " most choice structure , the White House , is architecturally affronted . " " Is the scheme to be definitely and finally abandoned now and forever , or is it to be maintained ? " the statement continues . " Delay means abandonment , because of added millions in improvements , or makes the accomplishmvnt needlessly expensive . If order is to prevail , the ban against Government buildings on Lafayette Square bould be lifted and the property in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is not taken by this Congress , the damage will be done before another Congress convenes . " The action proposed is as follows : " L Inclusion of Lafayette Square in the area reserved for future public building development ( also the Capitol frontages. ) " 2 . Immediate purchase of the properties in jeopardy , without necessarily providing for their Immediate use , and without interfering in any way with other pending plans for public building development . " Both objectives can be attained , either by new legislation or by amending the Public Buildings bill . The proposal is consistent with good planning , since additional sites must be provided in the near future . It will meet the pending situation and will tend to discourage further private expansion in this area . It is likewise consistent with a program of economy in acquiring , before the addition of minions in improvements , property which , in the opinion of the ablest planners throughout the entire country , should eventually be controlled by the GoNiernment.
