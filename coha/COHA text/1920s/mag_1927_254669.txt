When the Federal Government balances its books for the fiscal year 1926-27 ( ending June 30 ) , it will have a surplus of $599,000,000 . So said President Coolidge last week , addressing Federal bureau heads in the semi-annual budget meeting . The President also predicted a 1927-28 surplus of $338,000,000 . Feeling that the present surplus " is of doubtful value " as a guide to the future , the President gave warning that tax reduction should not be based on the returns of one year alone , also exhorted his hearers to continue the practice of economy . " Extravagance , " said he , " may bring momentary pleasure and apparent benefit , but it creates a condition which is bound to affect the future adversely . ... I do not hesitate to say that one of the greatest safeguards of this nation , financially , socially and morally , lies in constructive economy in government . " <P> General Herbert M. Lord , Director of the Bureau of the Budget , next addressed the meeting . He told five humorous stories : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro and a Negress ( Rufus and Narcissa ) , one about a Negro preacher with a fondness for long words , one about a fish too big to be true , one about a man who said that a church service " beat the devil . " He also inaugurated the Loyal Order of Woodpeckers , whose members will dedicate themselves to performing small but frequent economies , and " whose persistent tapping away at waste will make cheerful music in Government offices and workshops the coming year . " He concluded his address with the following poetical quotation from Nancy Byrd Turner : <P> Who loves his country will not rest <P> Content with vow and pledge alone , <P> But flies her banner in his breast <P> And counts her destiny his own- <P> Not only when the bugle plays <P> Stands forth to give his life for her , <P> But on the field of common days <P> Is strong to live his life for her , <P> He is not satisfied to claim <P> As heritage , her power and fame , <P> But striving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name . <P> <P> Observers agreed that the surplus would result in tax reduction at the next congressional session . Some predicted a reduction of $200,000,000 ; others of $300,000,000 ; still others of $400,000,000 , with the $300,000,000 figure being most widely held ,
