Capital punishment was established in Italy by Benito Mussolini , for a trial period of five years last year . Last week the new law operated for the first time , when a firing squad of Fascist Legionnaires shot down one Michele della Maggiore , a Communist convicted of murdering two Fascisti . This was the first execution of an Italian in peace time , since the penal code abolished the death penalty 40 years ago .
