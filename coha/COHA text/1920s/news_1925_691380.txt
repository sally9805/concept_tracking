District Court here Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp .. a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel , filed its complaint in a suit instituted against the U. S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corp . in May , 1924 , claiming $9.744.899 wick it alleges is'still owing it on the contracts in question . The complaint was filed by Cravath , Henderson 4 : de Gersdorf . Eugene G.

Thereupon Bethlehem sued the Fleet Corporation for about $9.000.000 , the aggregate due Bethlehem under its contracts . The government has now countered by suing Bethlehem for the return of about $11,000,000 on account of payments already made . rims cat t PT ION OF ' CONTRA CTS " Bethlehem is advised by its counsel that the government suit is without merits and that Bethlehem will sustain its claim . " The government 's suit against Bethlehem is based upon the charge that contracts between Bethlehem and the Fleet Corp . are invalid , although they were in form the same as was made with other corporations by the Fleet Corporation and the Navy and War departments during the war , when the fluctuations in the costs of /materials and labor became so great that contractors could not safely accept contracts on a lump sum basis andiafter the government had become dissatisfied with both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bethlehem 's contracts were what is known as the fixed fee plus a percentage of savings Zontracts .

" Insofar as has been ascertained : No other shipbuilder was successful in effecting substantial savings below estimated costs .

It is not charged that he took any affirmative action in favor of Bethlehem . The charge seems to be that he should have taken some affirmative action against Bethlehem . " The facts are : Mr. Schwab. very much against his will and at the urgent solicitation of the President of the United States and the Shipping Board , accepted the office of Director General of the Fleet Corporation at a time of a serious national crisis .

" A letter dated April 30 , 1918 , from Mr. Schwab to the President and trustees of the Emergency Fleet Corp . is submitted in the complaint .
