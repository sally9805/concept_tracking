The Graphic Realist FELLOW members of the Admirers ' Club : We are gathered this evening to hail the advent of a new genius . A fresh master of **26;82;TOOLONG fiction now swims into our ken . Gentlemen , I give you the name of : Bernarr Macfadden ! ( Applause , and cries of " vivid " and his pals , " arresting , " " powerful , " " gripping " and " waiter : my check . " ) Mr. Macfadden , unheralded and as yet almost unrecognized , is painting a portrait of contemporary civilization second to none . Second , do I say ? First : you never saw anything like it in your life . True , he resembles every other great artist in that he builds on the work of similar towering geniuses who have gone before . Like Dickens , he issues his masterpieces serially , in small , inexpensive parts . Like John Dos Passos , he carries forward several stories at once , Like Browning , he lets his characters speak for themselves . Like Lewis Carroll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . For example , from his pages leaps out a phrase , in large letters , " LUST FOR PEACHES . " This means something , certainly ; but " you look again and see it is " quite otherwise . Snuggled between these words are smaller ones no less important ; and the whole , you now perceive , says : " LUST FOR publicity made Daddy wed , says PEACHES . " The word " Peaches " as used by Mr. Macfadden is not the plural of fruit , but the singular of young women . It is the nickname of one of his characters , unhappily married to an elderly gentleman called " Daddy . " Her case is much like that of Pompilia in The Ring and the Book , a fact Mr. Macfadden gracefully though audaciously acknowledges by calling the pair " the Brownings . " Their stormy history is told at great length and with unflagging relish . Sometimes , indeed , the Maestro carries them to a climax where , with magnificent modernism , words are almost abandoned , in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole page to a picture of the stricken husband 's head , showing him weeping and uttering ( in a balloon escaping from his lips ) the pathetic plea : " Peaches , come back ! Or Daddy 'll go a-hunting ! " Next follows a picture of " Peaches , " of the same size . A balloon also issues from her mouth , carrying the words , " Woof I Woof 1 I want my alimony ! " ( Woof I Woof ! is an affectionate catchword often used between the two . ) Peaches has a monologue in which , after the estrangement , we learn that she " was humiliated when mate advertised color of her nighties . " Her suit , she promises , " will bare locked boudoir secrets . " She " now doubts his love was ever a wholesome one , and this makes her sad . " At one point Mr. Macfadden speaks , in letters about two inches high , of " PEACHES BABY , " but the accompanying words in small type make this mean only , " PEACHES says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daddy is a dog hater ; Peaches irked . " Daddy himself with Promethean dignity offers his liver to the vultures , and explains the reason : Why I am writing the story of my life under the title , My Love Life with Peaches : to restore the dignity of one of the oldest names in the United States . To satisfy my friends who winced that I should suffer silently . Another of Maestro Macfadden 's chief characters is Rudy , a young man of sombre , brooding temperament , whose career descends from woe to woe . I have space for little more than some of the chapter headings : " Rudy dared death for gay party in wild boat ride on angry sea . " " New passion born as Sheik played in Nazimova film . " " Mate of bigamist ? Rudy 's romance with Natacha breeds legal war . " Rudy , it will be gathered , like the Brownings , has been unhappy in his love affairs . Although in one instalment he " tells how to treat a wife and make married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudy , champion reel-life sheik , held wife 's love only one night , " and find that " ' Rudy not a woman 's man , ' was cry of Jean Acker , his one-night bride . " Mr. Macfadden and his hero face facts frankly . In his diary , Rudy is made to say : One of the very first letters I picked up today was from a fan in a mid-western city who asks me to write " the truth about my first divorce . " I pondered long over this query . It is no easy thing to grant . But I feel that I belong to the public . It is my duty to them , so reluctantly I comply . Turn now from this Dostoyevsky-like passage to the vigorous and martial ardor of another scene , managed by Mr. Macfadden with equal virtuosity . His female character , Sister Aimee , is the embodiment of Resistance to Persecution . Hounded by the law 's minions , she refuses to give in . " They call me ' temptress ! ' " says Aimee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph . " But my big moment will come , " paragraph . " I am beset by the very scorpions of Hell . All my life I have fought the very Devil himself and all his drug and rum crazed satellites . And it is this ' Devil Ring ' that is now striking back because they fear me in my great work for the Lord . . . . I have waged unrelenting battle with the BAT-LIKE DEMONS FROM HELL . . . . ' Scheme , scheme , scheme , ' cry the pack , snarling at my heels , biting at God 's cloak . " Yet . she maintains steadfastly that she is , as she says , " Martyr , not wanton . " Mr. Macfadden is like many another great artist , in that he refuses to remain anonymously in the background . From time to time he interpolates a few paragraphs which have no relation to the stories of his main characters yet throw a revealing lightning flash upon the days in which they live , the spiritual landscape across which move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time chanting like a chorus : Clear as are the philosophy and wisdom which lie behind his cunningly arranged mosaic , the Maestro is not satisfied even with this . He makes his point of view explicit by including in the vast scheme of his work a diary of his own , which makes you think at once of Amiel and Bashkirtseff and even has a touch of Rousseau about it . Jean Jacques , I am sure , would approve Mr. Macfadden 's sage advice to those about to marry : Cultivate your mind to the highest degree of effi ciency , but make your body superbly splendid in its strength and proportion . Then you will be properly prepared for a love romance that should bring happiness sublimely satisfying to you . In fact , like the acrobats ? I feel that he is a little unfair , however , when he writes , praising a movie actress who got one of her divorces quietly , and advises others who may be about to take the same step : Try to avoid making a cheap hussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap hussies of themselves , how much we should miss from the great scope of the genius of Mr. Macfadden ! Moreover , at other times and in other moods , the Maestro is not without his own touch of a certain sophisticated wordliness . Two of the favorite characters on his crowded stage appear and reappear , not in the text , but in the form of a series of drawings telling the story of successive episodes in an endless double narrative , the Antics of Arabella . From the mouths of Arabella and her girl friend issue balloons in which they tell slightly improper Broadway anecdotes ; while near their nether extremities are printed directions for performing a series of calisthenics ? a new set in each issue ? which the young ladies illustrate by their poses . This might be called playing one end against the other : by following the directions given by the girls ' feet , you will be restored to such pristine vigor that you will disdain to accept the set of ideas indicated by their eyes , listing heavily to port or starboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macfadden a master realist ; and perhaps the phrase needs a word of explanation . It is justified , I feel , by the fact that he concerns himself with the deepest human emotions , reveals them at their great climactic Moments , and minces no words in calling a spade a spade , or indeed , a **76;110;TOOLONG . Yet it is of course apparent that no such people as he writes about could ever have existed . He calls his imaginary city New York ; but I take it he refers to some future version of that metropolis , perhaps a hundred years hence . I trust that this is true , and comfort myself with the reflection that I shall be well dead by then . For great as is my admiration for the genius of Maestro Macfadden , I feel about his characters as I do about hippopotami : I respect them and I do n't want to meet any .
