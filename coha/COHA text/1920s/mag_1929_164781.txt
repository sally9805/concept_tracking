From the musty dryness of a Canopic jar which once stood in a Pharaoh 's tomb a London surgeon took the dead Pharaoh 's dried and leather heart . He dissected it and marveled . His amazement he told to Sir Berkeley George Andrew Moynihan , president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England , honorary fellow of the American Surgical Association , who last week retold : The heart showed a fatty degeneration and a hardening , and it was , wonderfully , the heart of that very Pharaoh Menephthah of whom the Lord said unto Moses , Pharaoh 's heart is hardened . . . . ( Exodus 7:14. )
