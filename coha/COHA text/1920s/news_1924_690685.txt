txt Count Corti 's Researches . Your correspondent , P .. Munoz Tebar , Mates that Count Corti 's two volumes add " little to the substance " of the Maximilian tragedy in Mexico . So far as this statement concerns only my review there is obviously more than a measure of truth in It . The review - threw but little light on the hitherto unpublished Mexican correspondence . of which there are approximately 100.000 - words . Not to give Count Corti himself , however , full credit for his research would be a matter of extreme injustice : for I remain quite firm in my belief that his Is not merely a notable but a final account of an ' incident that might have - been a world-shaking consequences . Whether the conclusions reached by Mexican historians are about the same or not Is altogether beside the point . There are . for example . not a few historians who have reached settled conclusions regarding the early Norse discovery and colonization of North America ; Could " papers " be exhut " ed that would show precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians are right ; that would not , however , detract iron the priceless value of the papers themselves . Count Corti was the first Individual in a position to show what took place in Mexico , and why . A scholar of his standing would never write so great a work if it hart already been " done , " as his appended bibliography of some three hundred items ! bows that it " has . " A. W. P.
