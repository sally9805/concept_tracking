His friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror that not only had Moltke 's bust vanished , but also that of Bismarck . Der Teufel ! This was too much . In a body , they stormed the Reichstag 's Decoration Committee , demanding loudly and angrily to be told why the great heroes of the Empire had been deposed in favor of an upstart Republican . <P> " Calm yourselves , gentlemen , " said the spokesman of the Reichstag Decoration Committee , " President Ebert 's bust was merely put there to see how it looks . Moltke 's will be back soon . So will Bismarck 's . " <P> But the irate Monarchists were not to be appeased until the Committee had promised not to remove the statue of Kaiser Wilhelm . <P> * Sadowa or Kniggratz ( 1866 ) : battle in the Austro-Prussian War which ended the old German Confederation ( composed of both German and Austrian states ) and resulted in the North German Confederation , the nucleus of the German Empire .
