txt Once there was a Progressive family , happy in its unhappiness over the state of the country . Now there is division among them . Some follow one candidate for President , some another , some are on the fence . Who pursues the pure Progressive truth ? Not even Senator NORRIS . He wants a Third Party ; but weakly pleads that it would cost a lot and that there is no time to organize it . He contents himself with advocating a constitutional amendment for the direct election of candidates for President and Vice President , and with sweet words for the election of certain " Progressive Independent " Senators , whose terms expire next year . HIRAM JOHNSON , that old Roman reactionary , is on the Norrisian fair 74-F.t . Mr. BORAH is not , but his term does n't end until 1931 . Let us not imagine that there is any wrath in the celestial mind of his Nebraska friend , with the Solitary One so active in booming and unbooming him for President . Mr. LA FOLLETTE was able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make faces at the Electoral College . Where is Mr. NoRRis 's ancient courage ? Was it wrecked , with all the other hopes of humanity , on Muscle Shoals ? . From this despondent Progressive it is a relief to turn to a hopeful Semi-Progressive . Governor ZIMMERMAN of Wisconsin , who is trying to be re-elected over the candidate of " the Madison ring " and that of the pure Conservatives , is all for HoovER . He fills Cedar Island Lodge with bright dreams . HoovER will carry Wisconsin because it is " a Republican State . " But there are two or three kinds of " Republicans " in Wisconsin . It is a Wet State by habit and referendum . Mr. ZIMMERMAN has the pretty notion that the support which Governor SMITH 'S views on prohibition may get him in Wisconsin will be counterpoised by the Badger fervor for the St. Lawrence waterv. - ay . This rum-and-water theory is ingenious . And how about Senator BLAINE , that impenitent Wet , that mocking sinner , who has scattered flowers on Governor SMITH ? His term does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bold . " Even if he favors SMITH , says the Governor , he wo n't greatly " cut in on HoovER . " The old talk ' is repeated of a rift between BLAINE and young Senator LA FOLLETTE . Again we are told that the latter will turn to HoovER . Why ? He was the high man on the list of delegates to the Republican National Convention . There he had a decided personal success . His standing in the State seems to be stronger than ever . Does he need to make terms with his opponents ? It does n't look too probable , but we can await without impatience his decision . At least , he will do what he wants to , whereas Mr. NORRIS wo n't . In justification of ? the latter , it should be remembered that he is a no-party man . So his adherence to the Third Party in 1924 may be regarded as a deviation from his strict principles . Even so , he should n't lament that he ca n't deviate again .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
