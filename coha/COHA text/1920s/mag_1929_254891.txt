<P> Four hundred million Chinamen seemed to be wrong last week , or at least totally incapable of setting right the affairs of their country . <P> On the north they suffered a supreme humiliation . Governor General Chang Hsueh-Liang of Manchuria Province capitulated through his emissaries at Nikolsk-Ussiriisk , Siberia , to the emissaries of Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maximovich Litvinov . Cowed by the Red Army 's raid into Manchuria three weeks ago , Governor General Chang humbly agreed that the Chinese Eastern Railway shall again be placed under the management of Soviet citizens , as it was before China booted out the Reds last summer ( TIME , July 22 ) . In return the Soviet Government agreed to cease propagandizing in Manchuria , but no Chinaman believed that this promise will be more than technically kept. * <P> At China 's onetime northern capital Peking ( now called " Peiping , " meaning " Northern Peace " ) a total of 39 generals signed a circular telegram to field commanders , last week , denouncing as incompetent their commander-in-chief , Chinese President Chiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one knew whether or not to believe reports that President Chiang had resigned . Martial law was in effect . Several mutinous army divisions were menacing the capital . China was another name for Anarchy . In the vast city of Shanghai , peopled by nearly two million Chinafolk , it was impossible to take a train or send a telegram to Nanking , Peiping or Hankow , " Chicago of China . " Wires and rails had been cut by men with guns who might be described as soldiers , mutineers , revolutionaries or bandits as one pleased . They all looted indiscriminately . Chaos grew so complete that leading Shanghai newspapers described one report of the President 's resignation as " received from a trustworthy source in Paris . " <P> Terror and chaos were worst in the far southern city of Canton . Originally this was the bailiwick of President Chiang Kai-Shek , and from it he sallied , three years ago , at the head of the Nationalist Army which proceeded to conquer all China ( TIME , April 5 , 1926 , et seq . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiang had sent to defend Canton , found himself so hard pressed that he adopted arriving measures . The first was to send out river workers and peasants to pick up the dead , bloated bodies of soldiers who constantly floated downstream from obscure engagements above . The corpses were searched for cartridges and small arms , General Ho paying a flat rate of $10 for every pistol or hundred cartridges recovered . " Some peasants are making $100 a day , " cabled a U. S. eyewitness . <P> Next , General Ho removed his headquarters from the city he was supposed to be defending to a strongly built cement factory on the opposite side of the river . Finally he sent an airplane to drop leaflets over the principal enemy force , encamped only 25 miles upstream , the famed " Ironsides Army " of General Chang Fa-K'uei ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) . The leaflets shamelessly offered following itemized bribes : <P> $25,000 to an Ironsider who assassinates his commander , General Chang Fa-K'uei . <P> $500 to every field gun crew who desert with their gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
