French Pealing Is Bitter . By wireless to Tian New YORK TIMES . PARIS , May ** news of the delay granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . received in Paris with disappointment and some bitterness  --  disappointment in Premier Briand and bitterness toward Premier Lloyd George . In the opinion of the average Frenchman , this . postponement means more than a mere delay of twelve days . For weeks the French public has been keyed up to expect something big on May 1 . Statesmen , in excusing or explaining delays , have repeated times innumerable : " Just wait until May 1 . Then you will see the fur fly . " And now the let cf Mayflies come and gone without action . It is true that action is promised in a short time if Germany does not meet the allied demands , but the French have become used to finding that Mr. Lloyd George 's simple delays often have se , rious consequences to their . plans . And so the attitude of 1 the French public today is not clearly defined , but It is , nevertheless , one of discouragement . its patience is at an end . The French have reached that frame of mind which was reflected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris today on their way to the Rhine . The French have not the slightest confidence in any German promises . However , M. Briand is fortunate in that the Chamber is adjourned until May 20 . He is perfectly free to do what he wishes until that date . If at that time he has not produced something he will surely fall . Tonight 's newspapers , without exception , express dissatisfaction with the progress of the conference in London , and between the lines one reads the fear that M. Briand has been " done " by Lloyd George . La Presse says : - This is the delay of the bankers of London and the English labor leaders , united in touching tenderness for German criminals . If England had experienced the fate of Belgium and Northern France it is probable that so much attention would not be paid to their objections . Now we are to wait eight days for the Germans to show good faith . That means eight days more lost . Oh , what an effect it would have produced on public opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered Ruhr May I ! The chance has come and gone . It will not come again . " The Temps tonight declares that the French have a right to be angry , but advises them to keep their troubles to themselves . " It would be vain , " it says : " to try to hide the impression caused in France by the news from London . It is profound and we believe it will be durable . The showdown of May 1 was the acid test of allied policy and allied firmness . This is not the fault of the French Government , - which tried to avoid today 's outcome . It is the British Government which must at this critical date assume the responsibility for the results . Let us hope French opinion will not give itself up to exhibitions of ill humor . " The Temps then- malcus the statement that at the Peace Conference the French were in favor of fixing a definite reparations sum , but that Mr. Lloyd reseorge way opposed because the promsea he had made in the British election uunpaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any sum iad been named which the conference mould accept . The Temps then accuses Sir . Lloyd George of having consistently docked the French plans to force Gernany to pay and maintains that under io reasoning has Germany any right : o further delay . It calls Mr. Lloyd .. eeorge 's attention to the resolution taken by the Allies in Paris Jan. 20 , to the iffeet that if Germany did not meet hose demands the enenalties would be Inflicted at once , and asks how he squares that stand with today 's attitude . " in short , " says the Temps , " for two Sears there have been two reparation policies . One Is that of France , rude in appearance , humane and pacific in fact , which tends to rapid payment and that Continental peace of which France has need . The other is the British policy ; which we refrain from characterizing . " We hope that these truths will be understood in the United States . The American Senate has just adopted the Knox resolution , which calls for a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States insists on fixing for itself the results of its victory , and is resolved . to depend upon no one to obtain the fulfillment of the treaty it will sign . Attached to it by unending friendship and love of peace and independence , we will ' respect its rights and we are confident that it , will recognize ours . " The Journal des Debftts says that it is worth waiting several days to get full English co-operation in the penalties , since it is results that count ; nevertheless , it thinks that the Premiers take a long way around to get to their goal . Several papers refer to Mr. Lloyd George as the man who is always putting the brakes on the Allies ' plans .
