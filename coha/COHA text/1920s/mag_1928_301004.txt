In the title Governor-General , there is the glamour , and also the distance of some far province like the Philippines . Since colonial days the title Governor has waned in glamour , but waxed in its direct power over the lives of U. S. citizens . This year , 35 States chose Governors-Maine last September and 34 States last week . In every State , where a real contest existed , citizens awaited for gubernatorial results with less emotion than for presidential , but with scarcely less concern . For politicians , gubernatorial results were almost as important as presidential because of the local patronage at stake . <P> For a variety of reasons , the following elected or re-elected Governors got special national mention : <P> The Governor of Texas , as everyone knows , is red-headed Dan Moody , 35 . By right of the usual sweeping Democratic majority , he will continue to be Governor for at least two years . And long before he is three-score and ten , he is expected to ask his party to let him do what , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alfred Emanuel Smith loomed mightier than ever last week . Not only was he elected Governor of New York for the fourth time by a plurality of some 250,000 votes , not only did he sweep a large part of the Democratic ticket into office with him , but he established himself as the most mentionable personality in his party until the 1928 presidential nomination is settled . " Thus reported TIME , after the November elections of 1926 . In 1928 , a Democrat again became Governor of New York despite a national Republican landslide ( as Smith had done in 1924 ) . The victor was Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who had , in 1920 , in 1924 , and 1928 placed the name of Smith before Democratic Conventions , and who had dubbed him The Happy Warrior . With his Warrior in unhappy defeat , Governor-Elect Roosevelt took small pleasure in predictions that he himself might be the hope of an , at least momentarily , nationally hopeless Democracy . Also , since he had not yet entirely recovered from paralysis of the legs , Mr. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In Connecticut was re-elected a Governor , famed for air-travel and for a daughter who is unannouncedly engaged to President Coolidge 's only son-Governor John H. Trumbull , 55 . <P> In Minnesota , in the county of Lac qui Parle , in the township of Lac qui Parle , was born , 45 years ago , Theodore Christiansen . He has twice been elected Governor of his native state , in whose university he achieved Phi Beta Kappa , before whose bar he made a reputation , and at whose public banquets he became famed as a defender of Babbitts from the attacks of Minnesota 's Sinclair Lewis . Last week he was re-elected for a third term on a record of economy and efficiency . <P> In Wisconsin , a great manufacturer ( plumbing ) , Walter J. Kohler , was elected Governor . This was a certainty after he had won in the primaries against the traditional La Follette power . Any Governor in a politically doubtful State may become nationally conspicuous-and such a fate was freely predicted for this **26;9576;TOOLONG       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
