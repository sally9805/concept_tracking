One of this year 's Nominees for President of the U. S. spent several anxious hours last week on the mezzanine floor of the Hotel La Salle , Chicago . He frowned often , conferred with friends , stared down his nose , hovered near a closed door behind which a meeting of his party 's national executive committee was in session . <P> It was a harrowing time for the Nominee because the committee was debating , and soon would vote , whether or not he was to continue as a Nominee for the Presidency , whether or not he was to be withdrawn and returned to private life as just plain William F. ( " Bill " ) Varney of Rockville Centre , Long Island , N. Y. <P> It was not that Nominee Varney had done anything , or was likely to do anything , to bring disgrace upon himself or the historic Prohibition Party . But some members of the party , believing that Nominee Varney could not possibly be elected , were for surrendering the party as an independent political unit and handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the dread and dripping Brown Derby . <P> <P> Eventually the committee voted and Nominee Varney 's suspense was over . By four votes to three , the committee voted that the Prohibition Party would continue . Its Nominee was still its Nominee and for him all good Prohibitionists would work , hope , vote . One of Nominee Varney 's managers quickly announced : " The position of the majority was that this election is not a bona fide contest over the prohibition question , but a fake contest between the modification program of Governor Smith , on one side , and continued nullification by the Republican Party , on the other side . " <P> Nominee Hoover could probably have merged the Prohibition Party into the G. O. P. by declaring specifically that one-half of one percent is , in his opinion , as strongly alcoholic as any U. S. beverage should ever be . But he made no such declaration , perhaps because he knew that about one-third of the Prohibition Party 's vote is in California and likely to be Hooverish anyway ; perhaps because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-fifth of one percent of the total vote of the country ( 57,520 out of 29,091,417 ) .
