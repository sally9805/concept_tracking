txt The most that can be said in praise of Senator NEW 'S proclamation of a new foreign policy for the United States is to commend him for having the courage  --  or the hardihood ? to affix to it his ' own name . Republican Senators , by falsely attributing Le Mr. VIVIAN ' views and opinions he never expressed , have compelled thitat ; gentleman to issue through The Asso- I dated Press a public warning that ! while " for the sole purpose of conver-1 ration " he has been obliged " to en " visage every hypothesis , even those ! " his opinion opposes , " he must be ; allowed to speak for himself , and that views imputed to him by others must not be accepted as his own . But those Senators have not given their names . ! They were willing , for their own self- I leh purposes , to compromise the distinguished Envoy of a friendly for-H eign Government , they did not shrink from an exhibition of the worst of international bad manners . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the hope of immortal fame is concerned , might have concealed his ; he might have put forward the " new , foreign policy " as an emanation from the collective intelligence , or want of it , of the group of Republican Senators who are plotting and contriving to secure control over our foreign relations . It is a credit to him that he acknowledges the paternity of the plan . The idea of the Senator from Indiana is interesting chiefly from its Vacuity . In his own words : It is directed toward the interest of the preservation of civilization . It declares no direct alliance and countenances none . But it is notice to the world that the United States , determining for itself when and how it shall inter pose , will stand ready to do its full part for the preservation of ' world peace whenever and by whomever assailed . This means that the United States Is to set itself up as the international bully , or as the international constable , or that . in future , it will take the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in the great emergency , without any antecedent proclaniatin of . policy from the Executive or from the Senate . Had the United States joined forty-seven other nations in the pact of peace , all of them would have stood by its side in any action taken to prevent war . Can any reasonable human being believe that this country would act more wisely and more effectively standing alone than as a member of that great League ? At a moment when the Administration is confronted by problems that involve not only the peace of the world but our standing among nations , our prosperity , our national pride and dignity and honor , the Republican leaders in the Senate , putting aside all these great matters , concern themselves only with plans for their own aggrandizement . The most disquieting thing for the country Is that they exhibit thus conspicuously before the world their mental and moral smallness , their ' complete incapacity for the formulation of constructive policies .                    @
