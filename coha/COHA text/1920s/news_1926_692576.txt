txt Our War and Our Debts . If the war debts should not be canceled , then we had no business in the war at all . If it was not our war , why did we enter ? Instead of forcing the grandchildren of the present generation in France and Italy and Belgium to pay money to our grandchildren , let us rather cancel the debts , set aside a. day of thanksgiving because we were not called upon to suffer as these other nations suffered , and then set aside a day for general humiliation because we did not recognize our duty earlier than April , 1917 . The war debts will eventually be canceled anyhow . The present generation of Frenchmen , of Belgians , of Italians will cancel them , or the next generation will . Human nature will not permit of their payment . We can cancel them now gracefully and with general thanks being offered to us , or we can leave it to these peoples to cancel them and be , for a hundred years , the most hated ' nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , 1926.
