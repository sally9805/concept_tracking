College Song . <P> Besides the Rhenish wine of tradition , good Italian wine in gargantuan quantities was brought to the Pope 's cellars last week by pious Italian vintners , grateful for last year 's record vintage of nearly 29 million barrels . <P> Into the Papal throne room filed 3,000 Frascati pilgrims in unaccustomed dress suits , black vests , white gloves . Each pilgrim grasped firmly by the neck a bottle of amber Frascati wine . One by one the 3,000 pilgrims filed past the Pope to receive a special apostolic blessing and then filed out . Left on long tables , 3,000 bottles stood against the wall . <P> Eager to emulate the Frascati pilgrims , other wine-growing districts of Italy planned gifts for the Vatican cellar . From the Alps 5,000 ex-service men had already brought a tun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tawny Moscato . Tuscany pledged 1,000 of Chianti . Umbria planned a gift of pale Orvieto Secco , most delicate of Italian wines .
