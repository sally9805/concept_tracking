When the Daughters of the American Revolution hissed and sputtered before and during their annual " congress " in Washington last fortnight , over a subject called " blacklisting , " observers concluded that the cause of the trouble was a policy of the Daughters which had been chosen by their high officials without the untitled mass of the membership knowing or caring much about it . Mrs. Helen Tufts Bailie of Cambridge , the Daughter who raised her voice against " blacklists , " made little headway at the congress . She and her friends and their resolutions were soon silenced . The victory of President-General Mrs. Alfred J. Brosseau and her sister officers was complete . Mrs. Bailie , however , had a last word and said : " Like the victory of Bunker Hill , it will prove to be too costly . The revolution is well under way and can not be stayed . " <P> How far the " revolution " would go remained to be seen , but last week 's developments proved Mrs. Bailie right in one respect . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven , Conn. , awakening to what Mrs. Bailie meant and what had happened to her , a dozen more Daughters-distinguished ones , too-not only rose in revolt , but marched right out of the D. A. R. , resigned . <P> The D. A. R. " blacklist " protested by Mrs. Bailie and upheld by the Daughters ' congress , had included a lengthy assortment of persons and organizations bracketed as socialists , pacifists , " radicals , " enemies of national defense . The list was for the " guidance " of local D. A. R. chapters in Massachusetts , to know who could safely be invited to make speeches . The persons proscribed ranged from Ben Gitlow , communist , to that eminent , peace-loving scientist , President-emeritus David Starr Jordan of Stanford University. * The organizations included even such innocuities as the Y. M. and Y. W. C. A. <P> Perhaps what started the New Haven Daughters off to join , and surpass , Mrs. Bailie in protest , was the discovery that Prof. Irving Fisher , famed Yale economist , had been blacklisted . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Henry H. Townsend , a onetime Representative in Connecticut 's legislature and Mrs. Josepha Whitney , first woman ever elected to New Haven 's board of aldermen . Mrs. Winchester Bennett , a daughter-in-law of the Winchester Repeating Arms family , was another resigner . <P> That none of these Daughters were easily agitable or discontented ladies was clearer to outsiders than in the earlier case of Mrs. Bailie , though the latter 's anti-blacklist utterances were at all times good-humored and restrained . But what seemed to clinch the " revolution 's " seriousness and modesty was another name , a name which the U. S. public would surely have heard often before were its bearer not one of the most retiring persons imaginable-Mrs . William Lyon Phelps .
