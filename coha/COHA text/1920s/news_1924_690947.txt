txt Lawyers have a maxim that hard cases make bad law . Something like that might be said of the Commerce Comrajsion 's decision to allow the Missouri Pacific to acquire stock of the New Orleans , Texas &; Mexico without arousing the Commission 's resentment . So important does the Commission regard accomplishment of the purposes of the Transportation Act that it sanctions a step toward consolidation not in all respects admirable . Doubtless the Commission acted sensibly in permitting progress to be made rather than delaying this particular consolidation movement indefinitely and discouraging all who are working in the same direction . - What the Commission found objectionable is exactly what this newspaper condemned when the transaction was first announced . A bankers ' syndicate has bound the Missouri Pacific for a certain period to buy stock of the New Orleans road only from the syndicate and at a price $6 a share higher than the syndicate offers the scattered holders of the security . All that ha 's been said about the services of the bankers to the vending stockholders and to the purchasing carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stich services have been amply compensated by the profit on the stock which the bankers have already acquired in the market ; if they have not , that is the bankers ' affair . A separate and distinct question is involved in the justification of a commission on the marketing of notes to finance the purchase through a different set of bankers . If it was necessary to assure the sale of the notes , so reducing the transaction to a cash basis , in order to make acquisition of control of the New Orleans road possible , the bankers who undertook to handle the notes were entitled . to a fair commission . The really outstanding question is whether any service on the part of the first set of bankers was involved in bringing together a party which was willing to buy at $120 and parties who were willing to sell at $114 . Obviously there was not . The bankers were able to stand between to the extent of $6 a share because they had already acquired enough stock to make it impracticable to obtain control without dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of position . It is to be hoped that what the Commission has said will prevent the attachment of such objectionable features to any other railroad consolidations or purchases . Any person or group of persons has the right to buy railroad shares in anticipation of selling to advantage for consolidation purposes , but not to contrive for the collection of a profit on the holdings of others . When the Commission approves of a price as reasonable for one carrier to pay for the securities of another , that price should he available to all holders . It may be worth mentioning that the Nickel Plate merger proposal is free of any such aspect as the ' tomminion here finds so objectionable . The projected new corporation is to acquire existing securities on the same terms to all holders . And in that undertaking , moreover . stocks are to be converted into stocks and not into evidences of indebtedness , as in the Missouri Pacific case . If necessary items were pruned off the appropriation bill would it be called a pork chop ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
