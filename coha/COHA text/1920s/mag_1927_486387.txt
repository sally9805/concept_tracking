A BILLION DOLLARS for the navy  --  that is Economy Calvin 's opening demand of the new Congress . Four new battleships , at $60,000,000 ; 26 cruisers of the 10,000-ton type , at 815,000,000 each ; 3 airplane carriers , 5 fleet submarines , and 18 destroyer leaders  --  this is the Administration 's five-year program . It is larger than the 1916 naval program  --  the largest in United States history . A billion dollars is a round figure ; higher prices are likely to make the cost still greater . And this in the year- of peace 1927 , six years after the Washington Disarmament Conference , two years after Mr. Coolidge 's Omaha speech declaring that " it is our purpose in our intercourse with foreign Powers to rely not upon the strength of our fleets and our armies , " one year after we sent our representatives to Geneva to persuade Europe to disarm .

Doubtless the signers will be - denounced as traitors for resolving that they will act on Benjamin Franklin 's discovery that " there never was a good war or a bad peace .

This product of J. P. Morgan and Company began his post-graduate course in international relations by warning the American expatriates in Mexico City that they were guests of Mexico ; he continued by traveling with the President of Mexico and sharing with him the most widely advertised ham-and-egg breakfast in history . His next adventure in friendship was to invite the inimitable Will Rogers to fool his way south of-the border ; and now he has persuaded Lindbergh to undertake a good-will flight across the arid mountains where Pershing once sought Villa  --  a new kind of Mexican expedition for a colonel of the United States army .

Unfortunately , we fear , Dwight Morrows are as rare in Wall Street as in the diplomatic service . - G OVERNOR FULLER of Massachusetts has just returned from a little trip to London and Paris where , he said , he found no evidence of dissatisfaction with Americans over the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. - Whether or not this was due to the fact that Mr. Fuller traveled under the name of Peter Bond we do not say , but the fact stamps him as a coward of a kind new in our political life . If he escaped from the Sacco and Vanzetti case while he was abroad , it met him almost at the dock on his return in the form of the annual report of the Massachusetts-Judicial Council , filed for the Governor 's inspection . In the report the council recommends no less soul-shaking a change than a revision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods of appeals in New York State . Thus , if the recommendations are followed the Massachusetts Supreme Court will in due time have the power of reviewing in full the acts of a trial judge , including decisions on motions for a new trial on the ground of insufficient or newly discovered evidence . Thus , in short , a repetition of the Sacco-Vanzetti tragedy need never happen . This , of course , is locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen . Massachusetts justice can never catch up with Sacco and Vanzetti ; but those well-wishers of the world , now dead , would be the first to welcome any change that might be of benefit to the people of Massachusetts . O KLAHOMA IS INDULGING in another of her periodic civil wars . Her temperamental governor , H. S.

Inevitably this little war is obscuring the issues which began the conflict ? Governor Johnston 's personal government through his transcendental , star-reading secretary , and the curious legal tangle of the Owens case . 0 . 0 . Owens , a member of the legislature , criticized the Supreme Court of the State in an oil case in which he was the defendant . The judges brought personal damage suits against him and he was sentenced to serve a year in jail  --  although under Oklahoma law contempt is a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of thirty days . Owens applied to the Criminal Court of Appeals for a writ of habeas corpus , and it issued one , but the Supreme Court hastily got out a writ of prohibition against the Criminal Court and cited one of its judges for contempt . The sheriff , served with conflicting papers from the two courts , refused to release Owens . The Governor sided with the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took jurisdiction and upheld the Criminal Court . The next act of this curious Supreme Court was to declare in an obiter dictum that the legislature was without inherent or implied power to convene upon its own motion . All of which leads one to conclude that the gloomy gentlemen who have pronounced funeral orations over " the last frontier " should buy tickets for Oklahoma City . O NE OF THE MOMENTOUS DECISIONS of 1927 is the unanimous verdict of a special court of three federal judges in the St. Louis and O'Fallon Railroad case , upholding in effect the Interstate Commerce Commission 's valuation of the railroad on the basis of 1914 prices . Although this particular case involves only $226,880 , it has been called " the biggest lawsuit in history " because it is regarded as a test to determine whether the final valuation of the nation 's railroads will be what the railroads want it to be  --  about $33,000,000,000 ? or the $23,000,000,000 set by the Interstate Commerce Commission  --  and accordingly what amount of excess earnings ( one half of earnings above 6 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the ambiguous phrasing of the Railway Valuation Act of 1913 . This instructed the commission to find the value of the railroads but did not define " value " or designate any means of determining it . Subsequently the commission put a constructive interpretation upon this instruction and based its calculation on a prudent-investment theory embodying the level of 1914 prices as a yardstick . The railroads have contended that their valuation shouldbe based upon the cost of reproduction today which would give them approximately $10,000,000,000 above the commission 's figure and enable them to collect at least $500,000,000 additional annual revenue . While the controlling opinion , written by Circuit Judge Kimbrough Stone , does not discuss the methods of valuation , District Judge C. B. Faris , in a concurring opinion , approved the valuation methods of the commission , stating that " it reached the valuation found by it in the only possible way in a situation as difficult as that . " The case will be appealed to the Supreme Court , but the unanimous verdict of the lower court is impressive . P OLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilsudski and Waldemaras , jointly declared before the Council of the League of Nations that they both wanted peace , and the declaration was hailed with a curious outburst of applause as a great moral victory for the League of Nations . The trouble is that they both also want Vilna ; and Vilna , as Miss Spence 's record , printed in our International Relations Section this week , shows , is the ca , use of all the talk of war . It is because Poland has Vilna , Lithuania 's capital , that the technical state of war has persisted these seven years , and Pilsudski 's histrionic triumph in demanding of Waldemaras whether he wanted peace or war does not change the Polish administration of the city or the Lithuanian desire for it . Little Lithuania of course can not fight against overgrown Poland ; the threat of open war has come from Poland 's ambition to annex even more than Vilna , just as the technical state of war has persisted because of the Polish grab in 1920 . It is a crime to legalize such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the continuing wrong done to Lithuania by loudly shouting " Peace ! " The Vilna question will not be settled until it is settled right . T HE NEW YORK TIMES did a handsome thing when it printed on its first page a dispatch , headed Revolt in Ukraine Was Exaggerated , correcting the sensational but false story to which we referred last week . The Times der-respondent in Rumania , Navarre Atkinson , still thinks that he and the Rumanians know more of what is happening in the Ukraine than do Associated Press and other correspondents who have the advantage of being in the Ukraine , but he modifies his early vaporings , and the Times honorably gives his retraction a prominent position . NCLE SAM IS ONE of the world 's great publishers , and among his best humorous periodicals is the weekly , Reports , issued by the United States Board of Tax Appeals .

We learn , too , of the ingenuity of the munitions-makers who did their bit turning out artillery on cost-plus contracts ? Symington , Anderson and Company , for instance , who contracted to turn out 3,000 guns , at a meager profit of $390 per gun . This corporation , founded for the express purpose of fulfilling a single contract  --  by the terms of which the Government paid for its building and machinery  --  sought to charge off the " loss " it suffered when the end of the war cut short its opportunity to make the profitable guns . " None of the assets paid into the corporation , for stock or otherwise , cost Symington anything , " the unsympathetic tax board pointed out , and it refused to - admit that the firm had lost a million dollars which it had never had . The patriots behind the company felt that the artistry of obtaining their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has good-will to do with the manufacture of munitions ?

T HE NOBEL COMMITTEE did well not to give its Peace Prize to any of the temporizing statesmen who . explain the impracticability of disarmament at Geneva . They voted it instead to two university professors , veterans of the world peace movement ? Ludwig Quidde of Germany and Ferdinand Buisson of France . Quidde is sixty-nine sears old ; Buisson eighty-seven . Quidde drew public attention by his " Caligula , a Study in Caesarean Insanity , " which sent him to prison for lese majeste soon after the Kaiser mounted the throne ; Buisson won his - first oratorical ? success at a peace congress in 1867 , where Garibaldi shared the laurels .

This organization , foUnded by the elder Brace in 1853 , was based on the then entirely fresh and surprising idea that institutional care was less desirable for the great majority of - dependent children than rearing in private homes . He sue -- ceded in placing thousands of children in homes on farms or in villages away from the city streets and safe from the regimentation of the orphan asylum . For many years a controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphan asylums must have made Mr. Brace 's life trying . After thirty-seven and a half years of unremitting labor , not lightened by controversy , Mr. Brace turned over the work to his son , then a young engineer fresh from the university . And after the same length of time , that same . son has relinquished the secretaryship of the organization to Owen Lovejoy . The Nation can heartily second the words of the society 's president , William Church Osborn , who said : I can not overestimate the great work which Mr. Brace - has done for the children of New York . His distinguishing characteristic has been his constant recognition of the interest of each child as a separate person . . . . I feel , however , that with the selection of Mr. Lovejoy the devoted spirit of the Children 's Aid Society will be continued and its work will expand with the needs of the children of the city .

Curtis newspapers as- being " the most vigorous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four years and four months that he has been in the White House , " the President 's message to Congress appears to us lame and weak , with as little evidence of courageous leadership as usual . It is to the New York Herald Tribune a document rounding aut " with exceptional vigor and felicity his political program , " expressing " appealingly his political philosophy . " If that is the case , then Mr. Coolidge 's political philosophy must be to face no issue until compelled to do so , to content himself with stating problems without seeking to solve them. , by more than temporizing measures . Only when he touches on the question of tax reduction does he hit from the shoulder . Evidently the Chamber of Commerce of the United States has touched him and Secretary Mellon upon - the raw . For the first time in his Administration , to our recollection , he assails an organization of business men . Here is his rebuke : - If special interests , too often selfish , always uninformed of the national needs as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines of propaganda , are permitted to influence the withdrawal of their property from taxation , we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust , bad for business , bad for the country , probably resulting in a deficit , with disastrous financial consequences . This is the solemn truth . What a pity it is that the President can not see that it applies to other special-interest groups , most strikingly to those manufacturers who rush to the Treasury to obtain special tariff legislation as a sort of government guaranty of their profits . To the tariff Mr. Coolidge continues his unshakable devotion . Yet , curiously enough , he goes out of his way to prove that 65 per cent of our imports come in free and that , of the remaining 35 per cent , 23 per cent are luxuries - and only 12 per cent are goods which can be classified as " manufactures and merchandise . " This produces about $560,000,000 in income . Thereupon he makes this cryptic remark  --  with that " exceptional vigor and felicity " of which the Herald Tribune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough seriously to depress many lines of business in our own country , it is of small importance when spread over the rest of the world . " We confess that this is beyond us ; - we do not know what the President means . The President declares against naval competition , yet announces that " we should refrain from no needful program . " He declares one moment that " we know now that no agreement can be reached with other nations which will be inconsistent with a considerable building program on . our part , " and the next moment , speaking of treaty limitations , declares that where there are none , " the size of the navy which America is to have will be solely for America to determine " ? as if this had not always been the case . Then he declares that if we had come to an agreement with Japan and Great Britain we should still have found ourselves facing " the necessity of continuing our building program . " So we are not to compete in armaments , but we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we please without foreign dictation , and we shall promptly build a large number of ships , which we should have built
