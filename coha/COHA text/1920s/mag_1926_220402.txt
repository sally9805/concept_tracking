COMMONWEALTH ( British Commonwealth of Nations ) <P> A million striking British coal miners ( TIME , May 10 , et seq. ) all beginning to feel the pinch of living upon meagre union doles , awaited with anxious expectancy last week Premier Baldwin 's long heralded address to the Commons outlining proposed legislation to end the strike . <P> Mr. Baldwin , compact , candid , assured , arose amid a portentous hush . Within five minutes Laborite M.P . ' s were no more able to keep still than jumping beans upon a griddle . " Who forced this on you ? " they shouted at the Premier . " This means a general election ! " <P> Mr. Baldwin had demanded the temporary substitution of an eight hour miners ' day for the seven hour schedule . For almost the first time in his career he was unable to command the undivided attention of the House . " You are going out ! " <P> The Premier developed his thesis amid a stramash of interruptions . He had no desire to lower the miners ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry could not support the miners ' standard of living unless they would work an extra hour . He proposed merely to suspend for perhaps three years the Seven Hours Act . During that period the coal industry could be put upon its feet by carrying out the recommendations of the Royal Coal Commission ( TIME , Oct. 19 et seq . ) . The Government 's offer of a 3,000,000 ( $15,000,000 ) coal subsidy was still open . It might be better , however , to expend that sum for the relief of miners thrown out of work by readjustments in the industry . If this program were not at once put into operation and mining resumed , Britain 's foreign coal competitors would succeed disastrously in capturing and holding British markets . <P> In a word , the Baldwin strategy was to enable the owners to paste up notices offering work to the miners at a tempting wage scale if they would desert their leaders , return to work eight hours per day . <P> Smacking down his fist the Premier concluded : " I will make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have resulted in the continuance of this strike . ... I have laid before the House the steps which the government proposes to take whether a settlement between the miners and owners is reached or not ! " <P> Though the government remained firm in its determination to jam through a suspension of the Seven Hours Act , the Labor party announced its irreconcilable opposition . Former Laborite-Premier Macdonald declared : " The Premier 's speech was most disastrous , ... will harden the miners into adamant resistance . " Secretary " Emperor " Cook of the Miners ' Federation apostrophized Premier Baldwin in a public speech : " You say , Mr. Baldwin , that you have no desire to lower the miners ' standard of living . Baldwin , you lie ! " <P> Crunching ominously , the Conservative political steam roller demolished a Laborite motion implying " no-confidence , " 299 to 138 . <P> At London the Baldwin eight hour stratagem evoked little enthusiasm from the man in the street ; but of course , the present Government can put almost any program it chooses through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
