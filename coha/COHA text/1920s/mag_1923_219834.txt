Music weeks and festivals have raised loud ensembles all over the country during the closing season days . The most notable undoubtedly is the Cincinnati Music Festival . This function is wrapped with the triple dignities of age , bigness and merit . Cincinnati celebrates its Golden Anniversary Festival , the 50th yearly invocation of tuneful sound . The first festival was directed by Theodore Thomas in 1873 . All of these events have been large and ceremonious . <P> Mendelssohn 's ever favored Elijah , intoned by the regular festival chorus of 325 and an added band of 80 men and women singers from the National Cash Register Company , with 48 professional vocalists to chant t he solo parts so that the quartettes were themselves fair sized choruses-that began Cincinnati 's homage to Apollo for 1923 . It was prodigious-for mere magnitude . Imagine a dozen soprano voices singing a trill in unison , as they did . The performance was very good , and received universal praise . It deserved it . <P> The Cincinnati singers were trained by Alfred Hartzell . The performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000 people , from all over Ohio and even from remote parts of the United States , gathered to listen . <P> The highest achievement of the Festival came with Bach 's B minor Mass . The chorus was still as large as in the Mendelssohn work , but the solo parts were really sung solo and by artists of note . A gathering of dignitaries celebrated the occasion . The Bach masterpiece is enormously difficult with its intricate weaving of voices in the manner of the old ecclesiastical polyphony . It is likewise immensely fine . Some critics rate it as Bach 's greatest work . Others call it the greatest Mass ever written , with Beethoven 's Mass in D as the only possible disputant for the honor , which leads to the interesting and meaningful consideration that what is possibly the highest piece of Roman liturgical music was written by the devout Lutheran , Bach , who was capelmeister at St. Thomas ' Evangelical Church in Leipzig ! The moral seems to be that the Mass is so superb a musical form , such a tempting subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of doctrine . <P> Among the operas rumored for production at the Metropolitan next year are Weber 's Die Freischuts , Massanet 's Roi d'Lahore , Mascagni 's Amico Frits , Wagner 's Die Meistersingers and Mozart 's Don Giovanni . <P> Die Meistersingers will , of course , have to come . It should have come before this . The dreadful scarcity of good German tenors is probably the explanation of its continued absence during the several years since the Armistice lifted the ban against German opera .
