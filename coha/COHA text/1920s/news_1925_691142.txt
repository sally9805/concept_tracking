txt Asia . Minor that supported large populations and fine big cities in times far from prehistoric , Can it be that CaliforOne . More nians have in visitors Critic of from the East only the California , interest that is measured by what can be got out of them ? That such a question even can be asked is very painful , but for the second time this week there has come to this office a setter the - author of which evidently has had some unpleasant moments out on the Pacific Coast and remembers its admittedly " glorious climate " considerably less vividly than the manners and methods of the native residents . The corroborator of the Golden State 's first critic expresses satisfaction that the grievance of such as himself has appeared at last in print . He ' adds to the previous accusation a feeling reference to " the uncivil attitude of the native population to all outsiders seeking opportunities in California , " and he goes on with some bitterness : " My experience in California has taught me to caution the unwary ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for tourists with cash . " Well , could n't about the same thing be said about any of the other States ? Everywhere there is an appreciably less warm welcome for " outsiders " seeking " opportunities " ? meaning jobs or a share in the local trades and industries  --  than for travelers who come with money to spend for amusement or to invest in real estate . The native Californians may be a little more " class conscious " than other inhabitants of the United States ? except , possible , the New Englanders ? and the Southerners  --  and the Middle Westerners  --  and the Northwesternersand the Southwesterners  --  and a few more  --  but the difference can not be very great . There are few parts of this rather grubby world where he who comes with something to give is not more cordially received than is he who comes to take something . That may not be noble , buts it is distinctly human , and surely the Californians have a right to be human . Ir . . E T. 1 NI That some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Lacking . drivers of taxicabs is necessary , or at least highly desirable , is shown by the record of the man LEVENTINE , just arrested for shooting and seriously wounding a patron with whom he had an altercation over a demand for more than an agreed fare . As LEVENTINE was driving without any license at all , he hardly can be taken . as illustrating a failure of the present licensing system , but he does prove that the protection of the public demands a more efficient and more often repeated examination of the credentials of men whose opportunities for criminal activities of many kinds are many . Both the record of LeVENTTN-E and his I reputation among those who know him are bad . He has served time in the Elmira Reformatory and has been mixed up in several cases of grand and Petty larceny . Evidently he could not have secured a license under the present or any other system that was carried out with any approach to honesty , and this LEVENTINE knew . So , when he determined to drive a cab , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual legal formalities . His quality is revealed by the fact that he was armed with a pistol , after the fashion of most habitual lawbreakers , and that his instinct and impulse were to use the weapon as soon as trouble arose . When he shot , he shot to kill , too , and came so near to doing it that his victim still is in grave danger and murder may be the charge against his assailant before the case ends . Not the least disquieting feature of the affair is the fact that when the detectives , after doing good work in finding the man , proceeded to arrest him , other chauffeurs crowded around in obviously hostile intent and made an attempt at rescue . That does not prove , but it rather- strongly hints , that those particular chauffeurs were not much better than the criminal to whom their sympathies apparently went out . Possibly JAMES H. But Climates Saute , the able repreReally sentative of scienI Have Changed . tui fi iec Fmeedteeroarlol  --  aat meteorology an Bureau In this city , went a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rotary Club that the world 's climate was n't going to change for thousands of years . That is long-distance prophecy best left to amateurs . But Mr. SCARS could have presented indubitable evidence to the Rotarians in support of his other contention , which was that for thousands of years the climate in this part of the world had remained about what it is now . Of course , our meteorological records have not been kept on paper for any such length of time as that , but Mr. SCARR mentioned one quite convincing Proof of his statement  --  the fact that study of the growth rings shown by some of the giant sequoias on the Pacific Coast reveal that for at least 4,000 years the seasons there have come and gone without showing more than slight changes , first in one direction and then in the other , according to the usual annual differences in precipitation . There has been in that long period nothing that could be called an alteration of climate In this country . Our oldest inhabitants , however , will go on saying that Winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories confirm their beliefs . For it was only the more severe Winters that made a lasting impfessioh on their minds , and they forget those at or near the average . That there are weather cycles , some think of about seven years in length , is maintained by credible observers , and Use cycles may have something to do with the sun spots , which have a way of increasing and4decreasing in size and number with an approach to regularity . But the world really has known , and may know again , . some real changes of climate . More than once the polar ice cap has extended well down into the Temperate Zone in both Europe and America , and Mr. ScAitit can not insure us , for all his wisdom . that whatever were the causes of the Glacial Ages , those causes may not , in the years to come , get into action again , and drive toward the Equator such of our race as then may be alive . Moreover , it was n't so many thousands of years ago that Northern Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and there'are deserts in By making something of an effort one can be amused instead of grieved at the news that , for the sake of Insuring peace , the man whose title of Sheriff makes him nominally the chief sworn maintainer of law and order in the county has promised to quit the town of Herrin and remain away until he can return without starting the renewed cracks of rifles and - automatics in the streets . This indicates , that in the past the activities of Mr. GALLICA:4 have not been exactly such as to inspire general trust In his competence and ability to guard life and property without regard to factions and feuds . For this suspicion obviously there is not a , little support in the Sheriff 's offer to go elsewhere for a while , but the situation thus revealed is a queer one , not altogether destitute of peculiarities more familiar in old-time comic opera than in actual municipal history . When a town Is safer without than with its Sheriff there must be something wrong there .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
