In a formal drawing-room , softly rugged-the studio of Station WEAF , Manhattan-sat a score of notables in evening garb . In the broadcasting room stood John McCormack . In front of him was a microphone . He sang Adeste Fideles with quartet and orchestra , the Berceuse from Jocelyn . Then Miss Lucrezia Bori rendered LaPaloma , airs from La Traviata ; then the two sang a duet from the same opera . Both were nervous at first , lacking the stimulant of a physical audience ; they warmed to their work , their voices were perfectly reproduced , even to the finest nuances of shading . Between numbers , the announcer 's metallic voice jargoned , reminded the throng of ghostly listeners that the two artists made records for the Victor Co. , that these records were on sale . Before Mr. McCormack sang his crowning ballad , Mother Machres , telegrams began to arrive from far states congratulating the singers . At the concert 's end , the selected notables in the reception room rose and beat their palms together . <P> Results . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Talking Machine Co. was advertised ; millions of radio fans heard two great singers pipe their sweetest ; tremors shook the frames of Broadway producers , managers . During that evening , many plush playhouse seats had been left gaping by folk who had stayed home , to hear Miss Bori , Mr. McCormack . <P> Said Arthur Hammerstein , producer : " Broadway lost over $100,000 because of that concert . " <P> Said William A. Brady , producer : " I sat with a group of people and enjoyed over the radio free of charge a program which I can only describe as gorgeous . . . . The plain truth is that we of the theatre are headed straight for ruin . " <P> Said D. F. McSweeney , Mr. McCormack 's manager : " Millions of people can not expect to get something for nothing . . . . Arrangements will not continue as they are now . " <P> Said Mr. McCormack : " I liked it . " <P> <P> Said Miss Bori : " I was scared to death . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
