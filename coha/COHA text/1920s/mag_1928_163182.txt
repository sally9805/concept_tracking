Jews and gentiles helped each other last week . It began when Horace Button Taft , headmaster of Taft School ( Watertown , Conn. ) , bustled into Cincinnati , to promote a $2,000,000 endowment fund drive for his school . He talked with prominent Cincinnatians , including his halfbrother , Charles Phelps Taft , * editor of the Cincinnati Times-Star . Next day , Brother Charles made a gift of $5,000 , not to Brother Horace 's school , but to the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati . The day after that , Taft School received a gift of $50,000 , not from a gentile , but from Mortimer Leo Schiff , Jewish philanthropist , Manhattan banker , whose son John was a graduate of Taft School &; Yale .
