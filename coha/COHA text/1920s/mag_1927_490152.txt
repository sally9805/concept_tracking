IT IS one of our weaknesses to point out a single sight or event as symbolic of our time or as an epitome of modern life , and therefore , during the past week , we have decided that the Christmas tree erected in Times Square at Forty-third Street by the New York Electrical League is the gesture that designates " the Holiday Spirit of 1 926-2 7 . " You will note , if you are not blind or very deaf indeed , that there are cunningly concealed , in this community Christmas tree , no less than six radio Loudspeakers , all going at once . But for more than a week now they have been speaking for themselves , so that we need not say more . NEWS that the United States has been running a speakeasy on Forty-fourth Street suggests a possible remedy for the liquor situation . Why not have government ownership of all speakeasies ? In that manner the citizenry would be assured liquor of a uniformly high quality , and the enormous cost of dry enforcement could be met by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we were making progress at last ! MR . TUNNEY , the best pug of all , has now been thoroughly discussed by the press ; and the character  --  whether his real character or not  --  which the public is to be taught to recognize as his , has been decided upon . It seems he is to be a man of culture . We think this is fine ; the more culture the better  --  culture being something most people ca n't acquire in less than twenty years . Yet trouble may come of it . The lesser pugilists always copy the style and manners of the champion , and it would be a shame if the profession got so cultured that there was nobody in it who fought because he was so tough he loved it . THIS is the week when a goodly 1 number of pleasant cooks , pleasant waitresses , and pleasant chambermaids cease their labors . At no time in the year are employment agencies busier than they are just after Santa 's nocturnal round . It is not that the cooks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; rather is it these wily persons ' custom to stay in a place until they have received a Christmas present and then to leave . In other words , a great many outrageously rich people are being outrageously incommoded these days . THE YOUNGER generation , educated as it is in the technique of nose-thumbing the Eighteenth Amendment , has received the passing of the three-o'clock curfew law withchuckles of satisfaction . So far as we know , nobody in the whole city supposes for an instant that the law will be enforced . Restaurateurs anticipate a rush of patrons eager to pay a healthy cover charge for after-hours dancing . Flappers are bright-eyed at the prospect of a new naughtiness . With Prohibition-drinking settled , organized , and in working order , the public has shouted for a new law to break ; and City Hall has responded nobly . ONE OF New York 's most dis-k- , tinguished tribute payers pauses frequently to pay about sixty cents worth of tribute to the unquestionable beauty of a red-headed telephone operator in one of the large office buildings downtown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ritual is pure enough ? ; t consists of standing at a little distance and just quietly paying tribute , while trying at the same time to look as though you were keeping an appointment or something . Invariably our friend winds up the session by telephoning his wife  --  a sort of spiritual vindication which has , we do not doubt , tremendous sociological import ? if you just know what it is . Meet " ' THE MOST courteous taxicab 1 driver in New York City , " bless his soul , is to receive an escutcheon of some sort on March 15 , and we entertain the sly hope that it will go to the young knight we encountered recently on Madison Avenue . He had just acquired an entirely closed car and found it no longer necessary to freeze on the front seat while his passengers lolled in the hot-house atmosphere within ; but even with his old car , he confided , he had met the situation by the simple process of turning off the heat . His clients frequently banged on the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sign . " I let ' em yell , " he explained . " I just yelled back , It 's broke , ' and kep ' on drivin ' . I was n't gointa have them sittin ' pretty in there and me freezin ' . There 's got ta be some justice in this world . " Rehearsal IT IS early , and the rehearsal is not called until two o'clock , but the hundred or so artists of the Philharmonic Orchestra are in Carnegie Hall , idling about in their shirt sleeves , tuning up their instruments , munching fruit , talking poker . One feels a little far from the masters ' music , beautifully played . Yet this atmosphere changes on an instant . The musicians take places quietly , tune to the oboe , and are prepared when Dr. Willem Mengelberg ? the stocky , red-haired Hollander  --  sheds his coat and climbs into the red velvet pulpit which is the conductors ' desk at rehearsals . " Good morning , gentlemen , " says Dr. Mengelberg , very cordially , and one expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in reply . No more time is wasted . He talks to the men quietly for a few minutes , praising their good qualities , scolding them for obviousfaults , giving a few special tips to the string players , and concluding with " You will do what I ask ! " which is said in a curiously imperative , yet persuasive manner . There is a moment of delay unforeseen . Dr. Mengelberg does not like the baton he finds on the desk : it is slightly soiled ! He must have a clean one ; he says he likes clean batons and clean tones . Instantly from the depths a wizard produces four spotless batons . The orchestra sails ' straight into Beethoven 's Egmont and its atmosphere is achieved by the gentlemen who , a moment before , were counting their poker winnings and hiding sandwiches for the intermission . Dr. Mengelberg takes part in the joyous proceedings by singing a melodic line , and explaining in English , French , German , and Italian the expression marks , adding a few subtle jests in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Dutch ' cellist of the first desk , and Maurice Van Praag , the manager of orchestra personnel , who is also a born player . THE rehearsal proceeds beautifully . Because of the brightness of the day , the tone of the strings is fine and clear . Dr. Mengelberg quickly absorbs the emotional content of the work . He makes his orchestra glow with tonal warmth and color . Perhaps , because of the dry hands , the shirt sleeves , the lack of audience , and its consequent relief from evening dress , and the tension of a full house , the men are playing more easily than at a public performance . Tension is good to give an orchestra a final tightening up , but it has its dangers . The men seem relaxed and happy at their playing , and best of all , a few minor mistakes occur . Not that these go unnoticed . The rehearsal stops instantly and the clarinets , bassoons , or brass choirs are scolded and reminded that they are the Philharmonic men , and that they must do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing it for them . There ! Once more Dr. Mengelberg repeats , " You will do what I ask ! " and the rehearsal is on again . Harbinger WITHOWITHOUT warning , a small UT mower came to light the other morning at Thirty-eighth Street and Sixth Avenue , and was immediately seized by one of our D.S.C . motor truck squads , in line of duty . There seemed to be nothing wrong with the lawn mower except its environment ? a winter morning , an asphalt pavement . The squad lined up to decide whether to junk it or salvage it . Two nearby white wings were called into consultation . One of them pushed the machine solemnly up and down the sidewalk in front of the Hotel Jefferson , its blades merrily twirling in the frosty air . The memory of last summer 's greenswards was faint in the chill morning . But a meeting of the Rota was held and the vote was unanimously for salvage . So it was installed formally on the front fender of the truck , one of the squad making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratch the paint . Then they shook hands all round , exchanged courtesies with the white wings , and drove off , vernal-hearted , down the wintry street . City MENTION , last week , of the new building which is to span Park Avenue at Forty-sixth Street , reminds us that when it is done the last of the empty spaces to the north of the station , so long boarded up , will be built upon . The fun we enjoyed as a small boy looking through the knot holes at the switching yards below and have indulged  --  ever since will be at an end . The Commodore , the Roosevelt , the Postum and Catts Buildings , the Grand Central Palace , the monstrous Graybar Building just completed , countless apartment houses , one by one have perched themselves over the railway tracks . Any real estate man can trace the area for you on a map . A city on steel stilts , its boundaries extend up Lexington to Fiftieth , across to Park , up the west side of Park to Fifty-second Street , west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way over to Madison . The city is only twenty years old and has grown without the fanfare of such lesser projects as Tudor City . Some of the details are interesting . All this massive construction is done on leases of a few square yards of steel , the tops of the foundation pdlars . When modern construction first made it possible to build tall buildings over the tracks , the New York Central solved the legal problems involved by erecting the foundations and leasing the tops of the pillars . Technically they call it a plane . One must reflect that the square inch rent of the pillar tops is undoubtedly the greatest in the world . With the lawyers ' questions solved , the engineers ' appeared . At once the vibration of the traffic below became a menace . The first step was to cushion the foundations , that is : to set the steel pillars on mats of lead and asbestos and mercury . Then , when construction reached sidewalk level , they set the buildings a few inches above the sidewalks . The space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their precautions one of the first buildings to be erected vibrated so much that china fell from the shelves and tenants threatened to move . Many experts were called in . Foundations were found in order , but the situation continued so acute that plans were being made to lift the building on jacks and build new foundations when the trouble was at last located . The head of a single rivet in one pillar rested against the head of a rivet in the railroad construction . The rivet was sheared off ; the inhabitants slept in peace . The authority that told us all this explained that the building planes are on sixty-three-year leases , which , in Manhattan , is considered eternity , for the builders all figure that they will have paid for their work in twenty-eight years , after which they will live on velvet . After sixty-three years the buildings go to the railroad . Two More y EE SHUBERT , the producer , IJ we hear , has been particularly annoyed this season by troubles of a musical nature . There was , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand both the French and the temperament of Mme. Sorel . Haystack-searching consumed weeks but produced the man . He was sent to arrange things with the actress . Then he reported to Mr. Shubert . Yes , he had seen Mme. Sorel  --  a charming woman , a great actress , a glorious artiste  --  and they had agreed on an orchestra of eighty pieces and . . . But just about then he was dismissed without references . Earlier there had been Mr. Shubert 's plan to utilize a $20,000 organ which had been left in the Century Theatre when " The Miracle " moved out . Mr. Shubert 's musical director reported , however , it was a half-note flat and would have to be tuned  --  at a cost of $3,000 . Mr. Shubert met this situation by suggesting that the entire orchestra be tuned down half a tone . ?

We now have to report that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arranged in sets and neatly numbered , and that every three months he begins at No . I and goes through the series in what the World Almanac calls chronological order . Celebrity IT IS to be hoped that M. Poincare 's cabinet will not be embarrassed by a further rise of the franc with this announcement that George Gershwin , whose billing might read " The Stravinsky of Jazz , " is now working on a new orchestral piece to be called " An American in Paris . " This effort is in line with his policy of keeping his classical work abreast of his popular output . At present his " Oh , Kay ! " is doing nicely ; and a satirical operetta in the spirit of Gilbert and Sullivan , with George S. Kaufman as the Gilbert , is almost completed . On the other side of the scale , for balance , are the piano preludes which the composer of the " Rhapsody in Blue " and the " Concerto in F " has played recently at the staid Roosevelt musicales . Gershwin , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product of Tin Pan Alley . His adventures as a pianist for a publishing house , however , were little more than incidents in his pursuit of a livelihood . Long before he played popular music he had an excellent concert repertoire and he still does very well with a sonata and a piano . While he was turning out early scores for whistling purposes he was studying piano with Ernest Hutcheson and harmony with Rubin Goldmark. 1- ' ' HERE is , perhaps , no harder worker in the field of music than this Gershwin . Royalties have purchased , among other bits of real estate , a house on the upper %Vest Side , just off the Drive , where two music rooms have been set aside because one did n't seem quite enough for his energetic purposes . In one  --  second floor front  --  may be found two pianos and usually Bill Daly , who conducts many of the Gershwin shows . More often Gershwin himself chooses the silences of a top-floor studio . After the manner of Beethoven , Gershwin sets down in a sketch-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of its birth and its subsequent development . Sometimes there is no subsequent development , for he is his own severest critic , and the volume is dotted with forlorn little ideas that never grew up . He often works far into the morning ; and , if you see a tall , slender young man with thick , dark hair and large brown eyes toying with a bowl of porridge at a marble-top lunch on upper Broadway anywhere from 2 A.m to 6 A.m. , you may be watching the recuperation of a popular hero from the creation of a foxtrot or a piano prelude . Such moments as he spares from work are n't difficult to dispose of , for he is invited to almost every party that is given these playful days . Usually he is asked to play and does so without the coaxing most celebrities consider essential . His informal repertoire is enormous and contains a number of songs he has written for his own amusement and which have never been published , including " Jascha , Sascha , Mischa and Toscha , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays with a large cigar cocked at a rakish angle , but recently he was overcome with dignity when called upon to rehearse with a symphony orchestra and appeared with a pipe . HE LIVES with his family  --  mother , father , sister and brother  --  and they all have at least a finger in almost everything he does . The brother is Ira Gershwin , now exclusive lyricist to George . He , too , be it recorded , is a serious student , a diligent worker , and so self-critical that , fearing to be known only as his brother 's brother , he began his career as " Arthur Francis . " Now , however , his lyrics go with George 's music but do not stand on it . And , inasmuch as it seems to be almost a tradition that composers should be collectors as well , it might be added that Gershwin is at the moment engaged in " going in for " etchings . He already has a splendid collection of orchestral scores including several old editions of Gilbert and Sullivan " sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , but we ca n't resist passing it on . The scene was the Adams House in Boston ; the Coolidges were expecting representatives of the press . It was the man from the Globe who came first and who sat in uncomfortable silence until Mrs. Coolidge appeared and suggested that " perhaps the gentleman would like a drink . " One drink was forthwith produced from an inner room  --  after which the bottle and glass were taken back into the inner room . Shortly afterwards the other four correspondents arrived . Followed more silence until l'tirs . Coolidge again appeared and again suggested : " Calvin , perhaps the gentlemen from the press would like a drink . " Appearing from the other room this time with four glasses , our now president poured four small drinks , examined the container closely , and announced : " Gentleman from the Globe 's had his .

In Palm Beach the Beach Club will still serve ? its famous Eggs Encore and its Cold Boiled Pompano with Escaffier Sauce , and it will still be fashionable to lunch and dine there . As has been the order of late years , the Four Hundred 's Palm Beach colony is still retreating southward before the advance of the nouveaux . The latest entrenchment is the Gulf Stream Country Club , fifteen miles below the hotels , near Mr. E. F. Hutton 's and Mr. Harold Vanderbilt 's new houses . Into this club not more than two hundred members are to be admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're real you need not bathe at the Casino with the hotel guests .

Such standbys as Will Rogers and Elsie Janis are booked to appear in a series of recitals inaugurated at the new Palm Beach Hotel . There will still be gambling , although no one knows quite where . At the moment , golf looks to be the biggest outdoor wagering sport , both at Palm Beach and Miami . " Animals " ( based on birdies , eagles , skunks and elephants ) is the latest betting game for golfers , rivalling Nassau , best ball , double best , aggregate , etc . Any golfer can interpret this for the benefit of old women and children . Among the cabarets , the Everglades Club and Sail Fish Club continue .

The gold fish , surrounded by many times their weight in water , arrived in installments over a period of three days . The first problem was to find tanks for so large a school . Agitated secretaries got little help from fish stores and finally it was necessary to borrow the equipment from the United States Government . The fish were unloaded from the cars in Harlem and were transported to the store at night . Here new difficulties developed . The tanks were slippery and the genial Irish gentlemen employed to carry them let so many fall that the streets took on the appearance of having been paved with gold .
