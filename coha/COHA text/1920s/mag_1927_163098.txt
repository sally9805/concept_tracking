" . . . Now , therefore , I earnestly request all the citizens to decorate profusely and illuminate if possible their residences and places of business . . . and to leave them so decorated and illuminated so long as these festivals shall last ... I further request them to insure by their presence in large numbers the success of the varied and imposing demonstrations which will succeed one another during these few days , and to do their utmost to make the celebration of this memorable anniversary a magnificent one . " <P> Thus , in sonorous phrase , Mayor Mederic Martin of Montreal called its citizens last week by proclamation to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the Canadian Constitution . Throughout Canada virtually all other mayors made similar proclamations , though none exceeded the majestic fervor of the Mayor of Montreal . <P> " The varied and imposing celebrations " of last week naturally had their focus at Ottawa-that now great and flourishing metropolis the site of which Queen Victoria chose as the Capital of Canada by a most quaint expedient ( 1858 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and brought her extended right forefinger down on a map of Canada . Then , opening har eyes , she remarked : " It is our will that here shall be the Capital of our Dominion of Canada . " <P> The Capital is still where a plump forefinger placed it ; and last week His Majesty 's Governor General , Viscount Willingdon , fittingly upheld there the dignity of the Crown by presiding over a series of Diamond Jubilee ceremonies lasting , on the principal day , from before noon until after midnight . Most impressive was the maiden ringing of a huge , sweetly toned new carillon from the Tower of the Canadian Parliament . As the bells pealed , their reverberations spread throughout the Dominion upon a network of repeatedly amplified radio waves . <P> To what extent has Canada progressed since her Constitution became operative 60 years ago ? Significant facts : 1 ) The land which was " our Dominion " to Queen Victoria , in fact as well as phrase , is now a great nation , legally co-equal in political status with Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) During the Jubilee period the population of Canada has increased from 3,500,000 to 9,500,000 ; railways from 2,278 miles of track to 40,000 ; industrial capital from $77,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 ; and occupied farm lands from 30,000,000 acres to 140,000,000. 3 ) Canada has gradually turned from Great Britain to the U. S. in commercial buying , so that she now buys $135,000,000 per year more goods from the U. S. than she sells to that nation ; and sells $345,000,000 more to Great Britain than she buys from the Mother Country . 4 ) A conspicuous instance of Canadian talent for steadygoing statesmanship has been the Dominion 's handling of the liquor problem . The British North America Act* was so drawn that the Canadian Federal authority has control over liquor manufacture and export , the provincial authorities over sale . Thus a majority of Canadians may not decree that an individual province shall be either Dry or Wet . At one time or another each of the nine Canadian provinces have gone Dry ; but the following have resumed liquor sale under restricted government control ; Quebec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Alberta and Saskatchewan , 1924 ; Ontario , 1927 . <P> *Passed 1867 , by the British Parliament .
