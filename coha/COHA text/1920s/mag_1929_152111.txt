More than two years ago , three doctors of the Harvard Medical School did a weird deed which they saw fit to keep secret until last week . Two female English bulldog litter mates were received in the Harvard laboratory . They were observed and found to grow normally . After a month a needle was thrust daily into the belly region of the slightly smaller dog , injecting anterior-lobe extract of cattle 's pituitary glands . Daily the doctors compared their specimens . In a month the smaller puppy had begun to grow faster than the larger one . Soon the smaller puppy was the larger one . <P> In June of the next year came a scorching day . In the morning , as usual , the dogs scampered and trotted out on the laboratory roof . Toward the end of the afternoon the doctors were summoned and there in the sunshine lay a monstrous dead bulldog , by now twice the weight of her litter mate , a dog fit for baying at enormous moons . In the burning heat her heart and lungs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dead though she was , however , she had proved it possible to grow giants in a laboratory .
