txt Action of du Pont directors in capitalizing the increase in the value of their General Motors holdings was of peculiar significance to John J. Raskob , through whose efforts the du Pouts first became interested . In his report for 1919 , President Ircnee du Pont of the du Pont company paid the following remarkable tribute to Mr. Raskob for his work in this connection : " Your vice president , John T. Raskob , with extraordinary foresight , interested himself as early as 1915 in General Motors Corp . to the extent of becoming a large stockholder and director of that company , and by exercising great perserverance was able to convince the directors of your company that the very unusual step of making a huge investment in an industry largely foreign to its business was warranted by the opportunities afforded thereby . The va/pe of your company 's investment , as measured by present market quotations , has more than doubled since its acquisition . This statement is perhaps stronger than any other commendation of Mr. Raskob 's work which could be made in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Raskob will probably admit that there have been many moments when he doubted the wisdom of the investment or the timeliness of the tribute . It was less than a year later that the du Ponts were compelled to borrow millions on their own credit to take up the Durant stock in General Motors . The hig motor company in the deflation received about as severe a shakeup as any company ever passed through and survived . But the $50,000,000 du Pont investment has again doubled in market value and John Raskob , in his position as chairman of the finance committee of General Motors , is in even better position to express his faith in the corporation 's opportunities . It was the courage born of faith that enabled him and his associates to take over the corporation 's burdens and bring it through the successful rehabilitation of the past five years .
