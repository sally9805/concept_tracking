Survivors THE YOUNG woman reporter set out for her first assignment in the dawn , rolled into the subway , tried sleepily to separate those who were returning from a late evening from those who were starting on an early day . At Rector Street she walked under the murky Elevated that shut out the half-light of morning and closed in the glow of street lamps , and the wicked brilliance of all-night joints . No one assaulted her . At the dock , reporters and boys with cameras and movie machines and a talkie outfit were waiting for the tug " Whistle " to take them to the " Vestris " survivors on the " American Shipper . " The men chatted confidently , chafing at the cold , not at all concerned with the approaching interviews . All of them acted as though they had . been reporters most of their lives . The " Whistle " pulled out with her decks filled and a dozen people crowded in the captain 's tiny cabin . " Your paper is getting passionate , " said a red-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview begins , ' Some of the tales told by " Vestris " survivors are very moving . ' " " This Red Terhune thing was in the bag . Sure , I know a guy knows a fellow knows his brother . It was all a put-up job . " " You 're crazy . " " The captain 's ordered breakfast served in his cabin for the lady . Hey , come on in and eat . Pretty soft , being a lady . " It was very pleasant , until she came to the rope ladder , slung over the side of the " American Shipper , " not even a decent one with rungs , but a Jacob 's ladder . She decided that the idea of " ladies first " was being overworked , and had never been sound , but nothing could be done about it at the moment , nothing could be done about anything , except that from one terrible toe-hold the next had to be reached and somehow during the frantic process the ship had to be kept from slipping out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to safety . Then the real excitement began . There was news on the ship . People told their tales , outlining the maddest dime-novel plots . People wrapped in blankets , their arms in slings , their feet bare or bound in rags or covered with water-soaked shoes , told these stories , trying hard to suppress their excitement . " I was swimming with a colored woman , for seven hours I had been holding her up , and then the lifeboat with six members of the crew in it picked her up . " " And they would n't pick him up , " his friend interposed . " She had to beg and weep to make them pick him up . " " Then later I saw my wife swimming out there , calling to me , and I urged them to rescue her . When they would n't , I tried to jump in after her , but somebody hit me over the head , and the next thing I knew it was night and I was lying on the bottom of the lifeboat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , " he said . " It 's true just as I December 12 , 1928 say it , so help me God . " He spoke with a German accent , tears shone in his blood-shot blue eyes . He felt a little disappointed when the reporter left him , seeking more color . Reporters spread all over the ship . " Were n't any kiddies saved ? " " Not unless they 're on another boat . This woman here tried to save one . " A lean unshaven man , shoeless , wearing a discolored shirt , indicated a woman staggering into the saloon . The stewardess , dressed in white , helped her , a stewardess a little conscious of helping a stewardess . " She started to get into a lifeboat with someone 's baby , " the young woman in white said , " and just then the lifeboat hit the side of the big boat and turned over . She fell in one direction and the baby in another , and she never saw it again . " The woman in the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dozen reporters surrounded her , but she was too weak to talk . They deserted her for the more romantic stewardess who had clung to a crate for over twenty-two hours with a young engineer . " What did you talk about during that time ? " She looked a little blank and smiled . " But you must have talked about something . " " Listen , do n't bother her , " the engineer said . He was a tall young fellow , handsome in spite of his shrunken suit and his unkemptness . " She 's been through enough already . " A sob sister whispered something in his ear , and he blushed . " I guess you 're looking for a romance , " he said . " Nope , nothing like that . I 'm engaged to a girl here in the States . " " Well , what is your most vivid impression of the whole thing ? What did you think about out there in that terrible sea , sharks all around you , not a human being , not a sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful . I did n't see how we were going to live through it . " The reporters fell to work on the young wife of the automobile racing car driver . They patted her dog which had been thrown to her and saved . They told her story to her in dramatic suggestions , reduced her to nervous tears when they came to the part where she was separated from her husband , where he was refused a place in the life-boat . Not that the life-boat was any good ? she had to be pulled into another . " What was it like ? " said a reporter vividly , " that ship sinking , your husband left on it , you seeing him for the last time , what did you thinkthen ? in that moment ! " " Oh , it was awful , the most terrible moment of my life . " The reporters tackled the crew , but they could n't make much headway with the sullen frightened mass of Negroes , half of whom spoke nothing but a crazy Spanish jargon . Lionel Licorish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chubby . " He saved dozens of people . " " He was the bravest man on the ship . " " What 's it feel like to be a hero , Lionel ? " He grinned broadly , and posed for his picture . An official at a table in the saloon shouted " ' Vestris ' passengers get your landing cards , " but nobody paid much attention to him . Wives who had lost their husbands wept and posed for their pictures on the top deck . Husbands who had lost their wives spoke shortly , grimly bent on revenge . Nobody bothered about a small quiet man who had seen his wife and baby thrown into the ocean when a boom tore loose from the ship and crashed down , bearing the lifeboat with it into the sea . Nobody asked for a picture of him , or crowded around him as he told his tense simple tale of the tragedy , aware as an engineer that the ship was doomed soon after she left port , begging that something should be done , seeing the water coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one flooded cabin to another three times , he tried to make articulate the awful feeling of helplessness , under what seemed to him the command of a madman , of forcing his wife and baby away from him into the lifeboat full of women and children , only to see them crashed into the sea a moment later . He had n't swum for twenty-two hours clinging to a crate , with a woman , and he did n't remember seeing any sharks . He would take a most indifferent picture . He paced the deck , bitterly cursing the dead captain , planning his futile revenge . " It was murder , wicked murder , " he said . " We would n't have let the captain live if he had n't gone down with his ship . " No use wasting any more time on the black gang , clinging together on the after deck . They stared out of large frightened eyes and remained mute , except for Lionel Licorish who grinned and a few others , sure that they were heroes , and the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship , Kodaking as he went . Cameras clicked and cranks turned on all the decks . " Come on you , get in this , hold the cat . Yeah , we want all of you . You , fellow , that took the pictures , get in this , too . " A reporter tackled him . This was a hero , the man who had taken exclusive last-minute photographs of one of the greatest disasters in history , who had not left his post until the ship had almost disappeared from under him , who had climbed into the lifeboat without wetting the precious film pack and tossed on a stormy ocean for hours before being rescued with his world-astounding burden . " What is your most vivid impression of the disaster ? What moment stuck out above the rest as the most awful , the most tragic ? " The seaman meditated for a moment and said , " I 've been thinking al , it that a lot and I guess now that it was the moment after I got into the lifeboat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high above me and strewn with men and women crying for help , and with dead bodies , and I got out my camera to take a picture when I realized that I had no films left . I could have kicked myself all over the place . " The woman reporter ran down the gangplank of the " American Shipper , " weak and trembling , tore to the newspaper office to write her stories , headlines swimming dizzily in her mind . " SENDS WIFE AND CHILD TO DEATH IN LEAKY LIFEBOAT . " All about her typewriters clicked , copy boys ran back and forth . " CAPTAIN DIES WITH A PRAYER ON HIS LIPS . " Storks poured in over the wires . " BABE SNATCHED FROM WOMAN 'S ARMS BY SHARK : ' Veteran newsmen asked her questions . " Can you check up on this shark story ? Is this man 's address correct ? " " CALLS CAPTAIN SUICIDE . " " Do you remember the names of the people in this picture ? " " CAPTAIN GOES TO DEATH SMILING CYNICALLY . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stories on the front page , read them and the others . Tears came to her eyes as she realized , for the first time , the full horror of the tragedy .
