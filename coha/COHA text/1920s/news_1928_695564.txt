txt ALLENBY OF MEGIDDO . Chicago has the honor today of ' welcoming Lord Allenby of Megiddo , whose conquest of Palestine in the late war was one of the most brilliant achievements of that great conflict and whose subsequent accompliahmenta as governor and in Other statesmanly service of the empire have earned the respect and approval not only of his countrymen but of America . We ' hope his stay in Chicago will be pleasant and that he will accept its greeting as a tribute to his character and distinguislaed career . ? LIGHT ON THE BOND ISSUES . The Association of Commerce has appealed to Mayor Thompson to revise the method of collectIng and spending vehicle taxes . The city at present collects about $4,000.000 in vehicle licenses each year . In theory the money is devoted to keeping the pavements in repair . In fact , the association has discovered , only 67 per cent of the receipts are &mat; for actual repairs ; the rest is dissipated in one way or another , much of it for eerical hire . The association believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 7 per cent of the total and use the remaining 93 r cent on the streets . Here is an instructive commentary on the bond Issues which the voters will pass upon at the November election . Mr. Thompson and Mr. Faherty are asking for $26,000,000 . If 32 per cent of the annual collection for street repairs refs ... , Its mark . What part of the $96,000,000 will go astray ? What part of the 926,000,000 will be used to keep the political machine well oiled ? ELECTRIFICATION . Fred W. Sargent , president of the North Western railway , has announced that the tracks of the Galena division are to be elevated through May . wood and Melrose Park to the eastern limits of the Proviso yards . The Improvement will break the bottle neck at the Des . Plaines river and give the region four tracks instead of two , and the users of the railroad an adequate service from their homes to the city . Every railroad transportation improve in e n t ' Wen the Chicago region prompts applause for a ' Wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come very rapidly , and probably so long as the controlling money is east 12%d the need of it is west there will be a lack of real initiative here . The greatest railroad center In the country is the slowest in getting modern railroading . The railroads electrify their eastern metropolitan terminals . Recent articles in Tax TRI13UNE by Tom Pettey have revealed what it means to a city to get rid of the locomotive smokestack , not only as It affects transportation but as It affects living conditions , value and use of real estate , and city improvements . Chicago has had an experience with electrification In the Illinois Central service , but , important as that improvement has been , it leaves the major condition untouched . It must be supposed of the higher railroad authority that either its eastern parochialism makes it indifferent to the plain requirements of railroading in the greatest center of railroading or that there is a mental apathy approaching tin : fitness or plainly indicating it . THE NEW UNIVERSITY CHAPEL . The new chapel at the University of Chicago is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new building in the religious life of the university and of the city remains to be determined . It is perhaps significant in this connection that the dedication service Is to be led by Prof. Arthur FL Compton , who last year won the Nobel prize for physics . Prof. Compton is barely 36 years old . He in president of the university 's board of social service and religion . Men of his youth and attainments in science of recent years have not commonly been conspic*uous in the formal religious activities of our universities . Plainly , the religious life of the university merits close attention if It is finding its leadership among men of Prof. Compton 's type . The university is to be congratulated upon the completion of one If the city 's most imposing monuments . The new chapel was designed by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue shortly before his death in 1925 . Mr. Goodhue was one of the few architects of our time in any land who have been able to breathe life into the traditional forms . The new chapel is one of his greatest works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Bartholomew 's In New York , and the state capitol of Nebraska . The new building on the Midway gives Chicago a superb example of cathedral architecture . ITALIAN FREEDOM OF THE PRESS . Mussolini at a gathering of Italian newspaper men told them that they were the freest in the world . The principle of Fascism is that there should be no opposition . If you have the most highly perfected or the perfected scheme of society and government , it is apparent that %vest. tion to it is not only unhealthy but ridiculous . It would be an Imperfection to permit it , and a perfect system can not admit or tolerate an imperfection . By a process of elimination and suppression opinion , journalistic and otherwise , is- brought to unanimity . Thereupon it becomes ideally free , In the theory of . Italy 's dictator , having no desire to say anything in criticism of the grevailing conceptions and operations of government . Mussolini says the press of other countries is not free , some of it being capitalistic and thus in bondage , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain reputable standards . So long as the Italian press is a perfect reflection of Mussolini , it is perfectly free , and when it is not such a reflection it ceases to be a press . Censorship and suppression thus produce liberty and freedom . There was a time in Mussolini 's life when he might have been an aid of Lenin in the invasion of RusSia . He was much better prepared to support Red communism than to oppose it . In spite of his emotional break from the direction he had been taking his idea of the state is essentially that of Lenin 's . He is now an even taller dragoon than Stalin , who has dealt summarily with the opposition but not so conclusively as has Mussolini . The soviets actually permit some variety of opinion within the party , and tolerate or countenance newspaper criticism . When opposition threatens personal power It is disposed of , as Stalin disposed of Trotzky , but Mussolini has been able to proceed much further . The preservation of free opinion , the guaranty of a free press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of representative democracy .. Representative government , says Mussolini , has been outgrown , failing to meet the needs Of modern economy , and consequently of the modern state . His state leans heavily on the assumption that an unopposed dictatorship will always be right , and that it is within human nature to maintain Permanent unanimity that it is right .
