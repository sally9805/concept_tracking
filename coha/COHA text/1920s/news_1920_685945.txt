txt Though opposed to foreign levy , The Atlantic Monthly has been stirring up strife domestic in a controversy between youth and age . All along the line the youngsters have scored over , the oldsters , as they always do ; and very characteristically it is " A Last Year 's Debutante " ? who has the moderation and the good sense to cry out for a cessation of hostilities . " Do not flatter us by noticing us ! " she says , with all the emphasis of iteration and italics , " for it does flatter " us even to be criticised . The more ob " jectionable ones among us love to be " talked about and written about . Noto " riety is the breath of life to them . " * 0 Do n't flatter us by noticing us !

Are we reconciled to the privileges of advancing years , the dignities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our generation that has insisted upon admitting at the polls only that one is " Over Thirty , " which the election clerk writes down laconically as Thirty + . What a list of sins our progenitors. might allege against us ! Faces shriveling like a Winter apple strive for the soft contour of youth . We have renounced patriarchal whiskers , refusing even to hang garlands on our cheeks from nose to ear , in the manner of the gayer blades of the civil war days . Years ago , in a far saner vein , The Atlantic itself pointed out that all the senatorial and the dowager insignia were obsolescent  --  not only the sweeping beard , but the black gown , lace cap and white hair parted in the middle . No one now alive is more than thirty plus . We are the generation that has murdered its grandmother . But at thirty plus notoriety comes hard , even to the most objectionable . So they take it out , as age unreconciled has always done , in an attitude of conscious virtue , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand in wisdom they will note this : When the Grundy folk hold up the hands of moral horror it is because the Grundy folk believe those hands to be particularly shapely  --  hands to which public attention is due ; when they point the finger of righteous scorn it is obviously gem-bedizened . Do n't answer them back , though logic and sweet reasonableness are all on your side . Rouge and lip-stick , which were once " the symbol of vice , " are now indeed applied " perfectly frank " ly , with no intention of deceiving any " one . " Some do it to make themselves look prettier , some to make Mrs. Grundy throw up her hands . Is it really " any " worse to make pink cheeks and lips " look red than to make red noses look " white , " the way the : Grundy folk do ? - Not a bit of it ! Butit will do neither you nor them any good to say so . Do n't flatter them by noticing their white noses ! If you listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are seldo:a heard , Last Year 's Debutante , because we so mutely adore you . Our preference is for cheeks that are pink , as no  --  rose ever was , with the rich floods of youth ebbing and flowing in them ; for cheeks that are white with a softness and purity elsewhere unknown in nature ; for cheeks that are bloNvsed and tanned by the breath of the good outdoors . For us , lips should be delicately colored and soft , as they were in our own youth  --  not meat-red , slimy and glistening . But that is only a preference , doubtless Victorian . Our real suffering is of the heart , in the manner of all true love .
