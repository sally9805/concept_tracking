T HE same old crowd of semi-liberals are reacting to the new threat of war in the same old way . The people who believed that by joining in the World War we could liberalize our Allies , that by intervening a little in Russia we could prevent others from intervening too much , are now appealing to the country to " help " in Turkey . They are the unrepentant Wilsonians who learned nothing from the tragedy at Versailles , or from the long series of **53;1485;TOOLONG tragedies in Russia . We stand face to face with propaganda for a new war , in which once more financial imperialism wears an ill-fitting Christian mask . The Associated Press correspondent at Constantinople is one of the worst offenders . He editorializes about the " exhaustless patience and moderation of General Harington , " who , it seems , has finally agreed to abolish the Allied censorship of Turkish newspapers and to withdraw Allied supervision of the Constantinople-Angora telegraph lines ! General Harington ought never to have had the power to censor or supervise . That is the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private decision before they meet the Turks at Lausanne , and then attempt to impose it on the Turks , there will only be more trouble . We do not accept without reserve all of Zia Bey 's tribute to the new Turkish democracy printed elsewhere in this issue , but in Turkey we prefer even an imperfect Turkish democracy to British imperialism . T HE majority report of the foreign experts invited by the German Government to advise as to the best methods of stabilizing the mark , wirelessed by the commendable enterprise of the New York Times , declares that stabilization is an " essential condition for saving Germany from the threat of a complete collapse . " Signed by Messrs . Keynes , Jeremiah Jenks , Cassel , and Brand , it is worthy of the difficulty of the problem , for it is fair-minded and just , while freely pointing out how much Germany herself must do in order to repair the existing situation . Indeed these experts declare that sanitation " must primarily depend upon Germany 's own efforts and own resources . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not relieved for a period from all payments under the Versailles Treaty any attempt to stabilize the mark will be entirely futile . So here we have the situation in a nutshell : Thanks to her large gold reserve Germany could stabilize the mark at 3,000 or 3,500 to the dollar  --  especially if aided by a foreign loan , which she needs to end the domestic panic and to restore confidence . But a moratorium for , say , five years is absolutely essential . If , then , Germany were told that at the end of five years a formula would be given her for percentage reparation payments based on exports instead of any fixed sums , confidence would inevitably return , and as a result there would be an improvement in every country in Europe , and in America , too . Thus , in a general way , the experts . But Poincare is threatening again , and says that if the Allies will not force payments France alone will proceed to act . If France is permitted to do this Europe will go steadily downhill ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question now is whether the views of the experts or the demands of Poincare will prevail . CC wE venture , for instance , to prophesy that Mr. Bev-eridge will defeat Harry C. New in the primaries for Republican nomination for Senator in Indiana , but that he will not reach the Senate . " We do not often prophesy but this was our opinion as expressed in The Nation for March 15 , 1922 , and events have borne us out . So talented a man as Mr. Beveridge ought to be in the Senate  --  but on the right side . The trouble with him was that he strove to ride two horses and to win both conservatives and progres-sives . Had he but stood out on the progressive side , without compromise , like LaFollette and Shipstead , and Brookhart in neighboring Iowa , he would probably been triumphantly elected . Half-way progressives do not win the voters any more . That , too , is the moral of the defeat in the State of Washington of Senator Poindexter , who had grown dull , stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67,000 votes and now he is defeated by a man , ex-Congressman Dill , who was driven out of public life because he opposed the war . In Maryland , Senator France fell by the wayside , partly , we fear , because of his sound and sane attitude in the matter of Russia . His loss will be distinctly felt in the Senate , where he could usually be counted upon to vote for justice and right . But on some issues on which no progres-sive should be misled he voted amazingly wrong , as , for instance , when he upheld the Fordney tariff , cast the only vote against the Treaty for the Limitation of Armaments resulting from the Washington Conference of a year ago , and voted for the continuance of our dastardly Haitian policy . When a politician risks his political life by some radicalism it is sound common-sense and good business for him to " go the whole hog . " S MALL boys used to convert the slogan " Votes for Women " into what was intended as a taunt : " Vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter as their slogan and , in emulation of their sisters in England , run for office . They ought not only to be candidates but to force their parties to nominate them in promising districts , by threats of bolting if necessary , and by holding over the heads of party leaders the power of the national women 's organizations . Some such duress will be needed , we fear , before women finally pry open the doors of the political cupboard . We believe , to be sure , in putting forward the best man for the job , whatever his sex ; we do not insist on splitting the public offices into equal shares , half for men and half for women . But we know without stopping to investigate that there are today hundreds of women in public life , and some who have never even sniffed the intoxicating air of politics , who might to the advantage of everybody be substituted for men now nominated and elected by all the parties . O NLY a few women reached the State Legislatures this year , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the sorry joke played on our women in the election two years ago of Miss Alice Robertson , anti-suffragist and sole representative of her sex in the present Congress , by her defeat and by the election of Mrs. Winifred Mason Huck , daughter of the late Congressman William A. Mason . Mrs. Huck is a liberal and a pacifist who publicly advocates an amendment to the Constitution making a declaration of war impossible without a direct vote of the people . The election of Judge Florence E. Allen places on the Supreme Court of Ohio the first woman to reach a State Supreme Court bench . She has been judge in the criminal court in Cleveland ; before that she was a lawyer , a seasoned suffrage campaigner , and , still earlier , a musician . Her interests are as wide as her experience . But even the election of women of this character does not make up for the lack of a greater number of successful women candidates . A LREADY some of our esteemed contemporaries in the daily press have seized upon the swing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is now ready to enter the League of Nations . It means nothing of the sort . The question of concluding a political alliance with Europe never entered into the campaign except in a few places , as in Minnesota , where a woman candidate for Senator on a League of Nations platform was snowed under . In Nebraska the defeat of Senator Hitchcock , the President 's special pleader for the League throughout the fight for the treaty , can be interpreted as nothing else than a determination to get rid of the worst of Woodrow Wilson 's errand boys . So in Ohio the career of Senator Pomerene , staunch Wilson lieutenant and pro-Leaguer , an " idealist " abroad but an advocate of American imperialism , was ended by voters who remembered among other things that he declared only last May that his vote for war with Germanywas the proudest act of his life . In Missouri , Senator Reed , who was honored in the primary campaign with a special letter of denunciation signed Woodrow Wilson , and was bitterly opposed by all the pro-Leaguers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wilson and his supporters can get no comfort out of these returns . R EFRESHING , indeed , is the promise of Jonathan M. Davis , the Democratic Governor-elect of Kansas , that he will move , the minute he takes office , to repeal the Kansas Industrial Court law , which he declares to be " unfair and unjust " " There is no need or place for it in Kansas , " he avers , to which we would add : Or anywhere else , so long as it carries with it the suppression of free speech and free opinion . Mr. Davis also declares for an end of the domination of the State by certain newspapers and their editors  --  he defeated Mr. W. Y. Morgan of the Hutchinson , Kansas , News , who was to have been the fourth editor-Governor of Kansas in the last few years . Kansas plainly had had enough of the Henry J. Allen autocracy . And so has Delaware of the Du Pont hierarchy . That little pocket borough took its courage in its hands and defeated Senator T. Coleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by approximately 600 for the long term , electing in his stead the bearer of an historic and honored name , Thomas F. Bayard , the fifth of his family to represent the State in the Senate of the United States . In Michigan the newly-elected Democratic Senator , who believes that he was chosen because of his denunciation of Newberryism , has taken the remarkable stand , of at once demanding the resignation of his future colleague , who actually promises to consider the matter ! But this does not end the tale of the hard luck of some of our very rich men in politics . In West Virginia a Republican millionaire who was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Senator has been sentenced to a fine of $1,000 and disfranchisement for three years for expending in a single county $37,500 out of the total of $96,000 he paid out whereas the Corrupt Practices Act allows an expenditure of only $75 in each county . T HE Supreme Court an abiding-place for lame ducks ? The thought is appalling . Yet Washington dispatches report that the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another that is shortly to be created , by the appointment of Senators Kellogg and Pomerene , whose defeat , it appears , entitles them in the eyes of the Administration to something " equally as good . " It will be interesting , indeed , to see what the bar will say to this . While there have often been political appointments to the United States Supreme Court it has never fallen so low , heretofore , as to be considered a refuge for politicians who were rejected by their constituencies . We can not , of course , expect from Mr. Harding the appointment of liberal-minded men like Justices Brandeis and Holmes , but the country has a right to demand that the sole tests for appointment shall be high character and legal ability , and that the mere fact that an office-holder is out of a job shall not entitle him to the highest position within the power of the President . M ARY McSWINEY is in jail in Dublin , imprisoned by the Irish Free State because she fought , and advocated fighting , for an Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after Terence McSwiney 's death for Ireland an Irish Government could imprison his sister . We have not agreed with Miss McSwiney 's politics but we respect her singleness of purpose , and we can not understand the psychology of men who keep her in jail , where she repeats her brother 's dramatic hunger-striking tactics . Surely Irishmen should know that a McSwiney in jail is even more dangerous to the government in power than a McSwiney free . Respect for her name and expediency alike demand her release . S EVENTY men killed by an explosion five hundred feet underground in a Pennsylvania coal mine  --  the newspapers tell the terrible story on the front page , and the public gasps . That is news . The public does not know , and the newspaper editors do not tell them , that this was only a little worse than any day 's toll in the coal mines . In September of this year 153 men were killed in American coal mines  --  and that was thirty less than the ten-year average . Despite the long strike and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1 and September 30 of this year . That is not news . We do not blame the editors for not printing these figures on the front page ; they lack the heroic quality of the struggle to rescue the imprisoned miners . But the public should not forget them when the miners strike for better working conditions . Not even in the union mines have the miners yet won the right to share in supervising enforcement of the safety laws . T HE San Diego , California , Union has challenged The Nation to express itself on the sensational testimony of a certain W. E. Townsend , a witness at the trial of ten members of the I.W.W. in the Superior Court of Sacramento , to the effect that he and hundreds of other I.W.W. 's were employed in the Chicago packing-houses during the war with instructions from " Big Bill " Haywood to poison the meat sent to American soldiers , and also that to his knowledge arson and sabotage were practiced by the I.W.W. in wheat fields and lumber camps of the West . The Union was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this startling testimony , which was sent broadcast by the Associated Press over the country . Well , the answer to this testimony was given by the jury trying the ten I.W.W. 's , for it promptly disagreed , the bulk of the jurors believing that Townsend had shown himself to be wholly untrustworthy . It appeared that he had deserted thirteen times from the United States military service , but had never been prosecuted for these desertions , although they were well known to army and navy officials and to the Department of Justice . In other words , Townsend was just a common or garden variety of government stool-pigeon . More than that , the testimony he gave as to conditions in the packing houses has been totally disavowed by government officials , who state that the allegations that he made were utterly beyond the range of belief . Our answer to the San Diego Union is that the government had better try again , and choose its hired witnesses a little more carefully the next time , and that this is merely one more example of the prostitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liberty which has been going on in America ever since the World War began . A FEDERAL marriage and divorce law , uniform for the entire country , is a fine-sounding proposition and undoubtedly has theoretical arguments in its favor . But whenone compares the present state of divorce law in this country with the rapidly broadening ideas as to a nobler marriage relation , it should be apparent that any attempt to crystallize a standard divorce law for the whole United States would be an unmitigated calamity . The present state of confusion due to the varying laws is at least forty-eight times better than the situation in England , for instance , where for years a losing fight has been waged to change a rigid law , cruel where it is not farcical and wholly out of touch with the times . Only the other day the House of Lords , sitting as a court of appeals , refused , doubtless in strict compliance with the law , to grant a divorce to a woman married to a convicted murderer , hopelessly insane , detained for life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision said : The true remedy he s outside any court of law . It lies beyond the scope of your Lordships ' faculties sitting as a supreme appellate tribunal . It rests with Parliament , if and when it thinks proper to end a state of things which in a civilized community in the name of morality imposes such intolerable hardship upon innocent women . A nation-wide divorce law might be modern and humane , as it is in the Scandinavian countries and in Russia . It might be like that of England ; and those who know the American temper have better reason to fear Puritan repression than to expect intelligence and freedom . T HE war was on . Men were being mobilized ; uniforms were needed in a hurry . The woolen interests smacked their lips and started the looms whirring . Just then the government announced that its own mills and shops were prepared to turn out a good part of the military requirements at cost . The woolen interests had to get along with only slightly swollen profits . The war ended , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods and garments and blankets for government use and for general sale . The workers received better than the prevalent wages , and a quarterly bonus . Although the output was sold at a price just above the cost of production the mills showed yearly profits , which since the war have totaled nearly $800,000 . These plants are not located in the United States  --  nobody interfered with the profits of the woolen interests here  --  nor in a socialist textbook Utopia . They are in Australia , where things have happened before . J USTICE VAN ORSDELL of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has decided that the minimum wage law of the District is invalid . " The constitutional limitations upon Congress involve fundamental principles of human rights reserved to the whole people , and not any favored class of citizenship , " declares this learned jurist . A minimum wage for women , he holds , denies the equal protection of the law to rich and poor , to strong and weak , to all classes alike without distinction . We recommend to his Honor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eye might pause at Chouette 's reference to " the majestic equality of the laws , which forbid rich and poor alike to sleep under the bridges , to beg in the streets , and to steal their bread . " In fact he might note Chouette 's conclusion : " In the name of equality it the French Revolution founded the empire of wealth . " Fortunately the Supreme Court of the United States has already shown that its idea of the " equal protection of the law " differs from the eighteenth century ideology of the learned Justice Van Orsdell.
