More than any other ruler of modern Italy , Benito Mussolini has been friendly to the Vatican . What is his religion ? <P> Benito 's father was a freethinker of the most virulent , nationalistic , antiPapal sort . Benito was not baptized . His mother was devout . In his Diary of the War , Benito reminisces as follows : <P> " I went to mass . That Christmas is still vividly remembered . Very few did not go to the Christmas mass . My father and a few others . . . . I remember I followed my mother . In the church there were many lights and on the altar , in a little flowered crib , the Child born in the night . It was all picturesque and it satisfied my fancy . The odor of the incense alone disturbed me so that sometimes it gave me unbearable discomfort . At last the notes of the organ closed the ceremony . The crowd swarmed out . Along the street was a satisfied chatter . At midday there smoked on our table the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a young man when he went to atheistic Lausanne ( Switzerland ) and debated with a Protestant clergyman the proposition : " God does not exist-religion in science is an absurdity , in practice an immorality and in men a disease . " Benito upheld the affirmative before a huge Socialist audience . <P> At middle age , Benito wrote a book : The Real John Huss . Huss was one of the first of the Reformation martyrs , and Benito praised him passionately . Benito was , at this point , a protestant but not a Protestant . <P> Came the War . Benito caught fire of d'Annunzio , and in 1919 he said : " I yearn for a paganizing people , loving life , struggle , progress , not blindly believing in revealed truths , nay despising miraculous pharmacopoeia . It has no room in an intense movement of minds and activities for formulae , parties and men monopolizing divine ' specifics ! ' " <P> Three years later , Benito was Dictator . As he shed Socialism , so he shed anticlericalism . In Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that the Latin and imperial tradition of Rome today are represented by Catholicism . If , as Mommsen said , 25 or 30 years ago , one can not stay in Rome without a universal idea , I think , and affirm , that the only universal idea which today exists in Rome is that which radiates from the Vatican . I am very uneasy when I see national churches being formed , because I know that there are millions of men who will no longer look to Italy and to Rome . For this reason , I offer this hypothesis : If the Vatican were to definitely renounce its temporal dreams-and it already seems to have started on this path-profane , lay Italy should furnish the Vatican with material aid ; those material facilities for schools , churches , hospitals and so forth , which a lay power has at its command . For the development of Catholicism in the world , the increased millions of men who throughout the world look to Rome should be a matter of profit and pride to us who are Italians . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's greatest religious organization . Is this a first step towards a true profession of religious faith ? Piero Chiminelli , in The Christian Century , asks the question and leaves it unanswered .
