As everyone expected , eight long-trousered , pipe-smoking Britishers were too weak to walk off with the Walker Cup , which eight be-knickered , cigaret-smoking golfers retained for the U. S. last week at the Chicago Golf Club . Never in the seven years of Walker Cup history has a British team driven far enough , approached close enough , putted accurately enough to lift the trophy . As few expected , the Britishers lost all but one of the twelve matches . Dentist-Golfer T. A. Torrance , Scotch by birth , English in residence , was the only British winner . Onetime U. S. amateur-U . S. open champion Chick Evans was the only U. S. loser . <P> Despite one-sided golf , the tournament entertained with extra curricula features . George Von Elm , of the U. S. squad , hooked a ball into the rough , came up to it , began to address the ball , was about to hit it when from the underbrush wriggled a snake . It disappeared . <P> Von Elm resumed his stance , swung his iron , lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery . None saw where the ball lighted , save that it plopped somewhere among the spectators . Everyone looked at everyone else . One spectator felt in his pocket , found the ball , in embarrassment dropped it on good ground . Not inexcusably Von Elm lost the hole , but won the match with Dr. ( not dental ) William Tweddell . <P> In the practice rounds , Francis Ouimet , George Von Elm , Harrison Johnston , Jess Sweetser stood on the eighth tee in the rain , waited for the honor man to tee up . Thunder blasted , lightning spat at a fence a few yards away from the mound , shocked slightly the foursome , most annoyed Sweetser , who had only to make two pars for a 35 . <P> Spectators , players alike tittered at Walter Hagen , who was working for a news syndicate . A few days before , Hagen started from Oshkosh , Wis. , for Menomonie , Wis. , drove instead to Menominee , Mich. , 300 miles distant , failed to keep an exhibition match appointment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
