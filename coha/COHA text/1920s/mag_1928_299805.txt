Another of Chicago 's gang shootings took place one pleasant afternoon last week . It was held at a spot where it was most convenient for Chicago citizens to see everything but most inconvenient for Chicago police to do anything , at the crowd-jammed corner of Madison and Dearborn streets , * two blocks from the City Hall . <P> The targets were Tony Lombardo , president of the Italian-American Club , good friend of Alphonse ' ( " Scarface Al " ) Capone ; and one of Mr. Lombardo 's bodyguards , Joseph Ferrara . Mr. Lombardo lay down on the sidewalk and writhed until he died . Mr. Ferrara , wounded in the back , writhed until the ambulance came . He died in a hospital without telling who the murderers might be . <P> When the shooting began , pedestrians screamed and scurried . Two men had walked up behind Gangster Lombardo and stood there emptying automatic revolvers at close range . When the shooting stopped , the crowds closed in again to stare at the victims and gabble at the police . The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver in his hand . But he was Mr. Lombardo 's other bodyguard , one Joseph Lolordo . The assassins had put their guns in their pockets , mingled with the mob , vanished . <P> It was taken for granted that the Lombardo killing was retaliation for the death , two months ago of Frankie Uale ( Yale ) , Brooklyn gangster ( TIME , July 9 ) . But , as in some 215 other Chicago murders during the past two years , no conviction was probable . Chicago police philosophy is to let the thugs shoot each other up and devil take the hindmost innocent bystander . <P> <P> -* Off Euclid and East Ninth ( Cleveland ) , Market and Sixth ( Philadelphia ) , Broadway and West Forty Fifth ( New York ) , Washington and Summer ( Boston ) .
