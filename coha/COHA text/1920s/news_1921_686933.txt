txt Borough President CURRAN gives it to Mayor HYLAN good and hard in his reply to the query of the League of Women Voters . The Mayor " is the " biggest obstacle today in the way " of home rule in New York City . " We have been set back twenty-five years by his " stupidity , inefficiency " and general lack of grasp of the " merest details of city management . " We shall get less home rule , not more , under HYLAN . ? That is the good oldfashioned brand of campaigning . It will rejoice the hearts of the scarred veterans . But Mr. CURRAN pitches into his own party not less vigorously , although his language is not quite So severe . The transit legislation of last Winter , passed at the instance and with the support of Governor MILLER , is , in the opinion of Mr. CURRAN , " fundamentally wrong . " He can see no justice or fairness in the working of that law . It should be amended next Winter " to " restore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject any " change " in the subway contracts recommended by the Transit Commission . Although he is a coalition candidate for the Mayoralty nomination in the primaries ? Mr. CURRAN is a Republican , was designated as a Republican . Somehow , we do not know by What theory of politics or what process of reasoning , he seeins to have persuaded himself that he is advancing his cause by attacking his own party and denouncing as " fundamentally wrong " the chief enactment of the last session of the Legislature of his party . If it be true that Mayor HYLA14 is ignorant and inefficient and the biggest obstacle to home rule , how are the interests of the people of the city advanced by Mr. CURRAN 'S adoption of ? . a method of campaigning Which ' mast people : would say will naturally lead to the re-elictioil ot the presera Mayor ? The . act creating the new Transit Commission had the support of the business interests and the business men of New York City , men who are . no less solicitous than Mr .. CURRAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been successful in this city without the support of the business elements of the community ? sometimes not even with that support . When men of affairs look upon the creation of the Transit Commis.iion as the most hopeful effort to solve the difficult problem of the traction companies in a way to promote the public interest and convenience , and when they see the coalition candidate for Mayor denounce the commission idea and demand the repeal of the act , it is not unlikely that many of them will seriously ask ? themselves whether , upon that point , the coalition p:iicies are any sounder and better than Tammany 's . Mr. CURRAN would have gained in reputation , we are altogether confident he would have gained in. votes , had he chosen to await the putting ' forth of the plan of the Transit Commission before opening fire upon Governor Nin.r , ER , the up-State Republicans , the Transit act , and a very great part of those whose Support is going to be necessary for ' his election . He speaks out emphatically for a five-cent fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan will make a continuance of the five-cent fare possible . Could " home rule " do more than that ? Could Mr. CURRAN himself devise a , plan that would be better ' ? Particularly if the commission not only saves the five-cent fare , but saves the companies from bankruptcy and ruin . . In the opinion of many sensible men , the Transit Commission is a home rule body . Its powers are drawn from the State , and of those powers the State can not be divested by- anything the city could do . But it is administered by New York men , faithfully , conscientiously striving to serve the interests of New York 's people . In view of the shocking things Mr. CURRAN says about Mayor HYLAN. and , further , in view of the'fact that from time to time we are hound to have Mayors like Mr. HYLAN , is it not a blessing and cause for congratulation that the control over so impuItant a part ' ' Of the city machinery as the traction lines is put ' beyond the accident of transfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission will be known by its works . We advise Mr. CURRAN - to wait and see its plan . He can not make much headway politically by adopting the same tactics toward the commission that Mayor HyLA.N. - has made Ms own .
