Many inventors have experimented with a typewriter for transcribing music , but hitherto the results have been small . But now comes the report that a London musician , Signor Fortoni , has devised a typewriter which copies a sheet of music complete with all the signs . It appears that the new machine is a complicated affair , and that its cost of manufacture is a formidable affair . If the device should prove to be commercially practicable , it will be a great aid to musicians , since the labor of writing out large scores is a heavy burden upon composers . Of course , it may be that the effort of using the music typewriter will prove to be as great as that of pen and ink note-writing.
