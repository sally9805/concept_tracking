" Five Yards " McCarty of Chicago ran after Swede Oberlander of Dartmouth , was knocked down , arose and ran again . Throughout the game this performance was repeated . Often McCarty caught Oberlander , but when the latter , instead of carrying the ball , dropped back and fired it accurately into the reaching hands of Lane , then McCarty and Chicago were baffled , and Dartmouth swept on to a 33 to 7 victory that carries with it the unofficial national football title . <P> " Block that kick ! Block that kick ! " The Yale cheering section repeated the phrase monotonously in the belief that it would annoy Slagle ( Princeton ) who was about to punt . Evidently it did , for Slagle , instead of kicking , started for the Yale right end with the ball under his arm . A few moments later he was 82 yards farther down the field , which was as far as he needed to go . In the next period , when Princeton was in danger , Dignan punted 71 yards . These two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wavered , made it possible for big W. H. Edwards ( " Peter Pan of Princeton " ) to climb down from the stands and lead a writhing battalion to tear down the goal posts for souvenirs . Score : Princeton 25 , Yale 12 . <P> Harold ( " Red " ) Grange of Illinois ( who has received so much publicity that the Knickerbocker Ice Co. recommended its product to the public on the score that he has carried ice on his back ) sat on a bench and saw his second and third string teammates beat Wabash on a sloppy field , 21 to 0 . <P> Minnesota crushed Iowa , 33 to 0 . <P> Molenda of Michigan ( " Wild Bull of the Campus " ) threw himself over a brawl of huddled linesmen to secure a touchdown which , supplemented by a field goal , won the game in the first half . Score : Michigan 10 , Ohio State 0 . <P> Cornell 's uncertain team , held scoreless in the first half , worked up steam slowly like an old locomotive on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canissius , 33 to 0 . <P> Chauncey is not a name with a particularly manly sound , and Boston " townies " were loud with their falsetto derision of this newcomer in the Harvard backfield . But however funny the name of Chauncey-or the name of Marion Adolphus Cheek , for that matter-may have been to pool-parlor nickel-spinners , the weaker sisters of the Harvard eleven would have fared badly had not Chauncey 's toe sent a ball over the crossbar . Score : Harvard 3 , Brown 0 . <P> In the middle of the second period of the Pittsburgh-Penn game , the Umpire and the Referee saw two players exchanging vigorous fisticuffs , sent both of them off the field . A groan went up from the Pittsburgh stands for one of the pummelers was Fullback " Gus " Gustafson , their flower . But already this nimble Nordic had materially assisted in the scoring of two touchdowns , which was enough to win the game , 14 to 0 . <P> Because of all the strutting which , by some obscure military convention , West Point cadets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defeat for the Army seems doubly degrading . Columbia , with Pease back in gear , inflicted this humilation upon the grey-coats . Score : Columbia 21 , Army 7 . <P> On a muddy field in the Berkshire hills , Amherst won the " Little Three Championship " from Williams , 13 to 7.
