ENATOR BORAH 'S clear-cut address , which we print / in this week 's International Relations Section , follows the outline of the foreign policy which The Nation has been advocating for more than four years . We urge our readers to study it . Too many faint hearts in America , we believe , cling to the Geneva League as " the only hope we have , " and overlook the immediate steps of a forward-looking policy . They tend to overstress the importance of paper and machinery . As Senator Borah says : " There is no hope for peace so long as the great and powerful nations will that there shall be no peace . . . . We confine our love of peace to paper ; our war spirit finds its expression in deeds . " The United States could do more for world peace by getting out of Haiti and offering that pitiful republic reparation for our crimes there than by joining the half-hearted World Court at the Hague . The League 's ban still maintained against Germany and Soviet Russia is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it was born in a flood of honeyed words . If we are to take forward steps on paper let them be whole-hearted , as Senator Borah urges , not hesitating gestures of timorous good intentions . If we join the World Court , let us make our action count- by insisting that it be made a , court of real authority . Let us not be afraid to move for the outlawry of war . The fact that Senator Borah has replaced Senator Lodge as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate is one of the best New Year 's gifts which the world could have . M ITE PROGRESSIVE GROUP in Congress is not so cowed and dispirited as some observers believed at the beginning of the present session . Certainly Senator Norris is not hesitating in his magnificent fight against the scheme of President Coolidge and the Republican majority to despoil the rights of the people in the great natural water-power at Muscle Shoals . The Underwood bill does not give , as has in some places been stated , the alternative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for half a century to a private money-making corporation , merely containing the proviso that if a bid is not forthcoming satisfactory to the Secretary of War the Government shall continue ( pending further legislation ) a control which it already has . In spite of the report of the Committee on Agriculture in favor of continued government control , the Senate majority is sponsoring almost without discussion or consideration a brand-new plan which Senator Norris describes accurately as carrying " a deed of conveyance to the electric water-power trust of America for one of the greatest inheritances of unborn generations of American citizens . " O NCE IN A WHILE a paragraph appears on the editorial page of one of the daily newspapers which so precisely and pertinently expresses our thought that we can only reprint it , wishing we had written it . Such an editorial is the following from the New York World : Zamboanga lies at the extreme western end of the Island of Mindanao in the Philippines . It is a port of entry and an important trading-point . A band of Moro outlaws raided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store . Since the scene of the crime is American territory , under the American flag , the killing of five nameless Chinese causes no great agitation in official circles in Washington . No one feels called upon to proclaim that the persons of all foreigners must be held sacred and in frantic haste to cable a peremptory demand for the payment of large indemnities . But change the scene from the Philippines to China across the sea . Establish an American trading-post or mission there . Then , if a pai by of Chinese bandits raids the Americans ' property , threatens to hold them for ransom or mistreats them , that 's another story . It 's an international incident that calls for the use of American gunboats in Chinese waters , for the landing of marines , and for official messages to the Chinese Government bristling with solemn threats . ' 4 ANY SUPPORTERS OF SENATOR LA FOLLETTE .0 " ) . in the recent campaign were disquieted because his proposals were attacked so largely and successfully not by argument but by misrepresentation . They have questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electorate could be hoodwinked so easily and effectively . Evidently this uneasiness is not confined to Mr. La Follette 's supporters . Speaking before the League of Women Voters in Chicago lately David Lawrence , whose Washington correspondence goes into the most conservative newspapers , said that never before in his recollection had there been such misrepresentation " not only of the spirit but the letter of the Constitution by campaign speakers . " Let us revert for a moment to the proposal made by Senator La Follette in the last campaign with respect to the Supreme Court he said . I am not in sympathy with Senator La Follette 's programs nor do I believe the wrongs he seeks to remedy should be corrected by the method he proposes , but as an American I can not refrain from expressing disappointment that a proposal to amend the Constitution in the regular way should be hailed as an attempt " to overthrow the Constitution . " Senator La Follette proposed that an amendment be submitted to Congress to be passed by a two-thirds vote and to be submitted thereafter to three-fourths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been elected President he could not have approved or disapproved the amendment . Presidents can not veto or ratify constitutional amendments . That power is lodged wholly in Congress and the legislatures of the several States . Did we tell the electorate that frankly in the last campaign or did we exaggerate ? I leave it to you to decide . I ELECTING WILLIAM GREEN to succeed Samuel 1 Gompers his fellow-members of the executive council of the American Federation of Labor chose the man whose advent to the presidency would mean least change . Of his two chief rivals one , James Duncan of the granite-cutters , was an old man and weak , who could not have held the helm ; the other , Matthew Woll , of the photo-engravers , was a younger man with ideas of his own . Green is more dependable than either . In the mine-workers ' union he has served as a sort of permanent official , surviving changes in ovIonancoi , . - cm chiefs In recent years he has often disagreed with John Lewis , but he has done Lewis 's bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade-union progress , have become a bulwark of labor reaction . In his home at Coshocton , Ohio , Green is known as a " joiner , " a good Sunday-school teacher , and a regular party Democrat . He was one of the minority who voted against indorsement of La Follette 's candidacy by the labor federation . His arrival at its top means that Gompers 's old cabinet continues its control of federation policies ; but the permanence of that cabinet without " the old man " is another question . VEN IN GERMANY no one seems to be quite sure I-4 what happened at the December 7 election . The extremists lost  --  yes , but who won ? The Republican parties gained , and so did the Nationalists . Communists and Fascists lost , but the shift toward the center was so slight that weeks of parliamentary negotiations are necessary for the formation of a new Cabinet . ? Part of the difficulty in interpreting the results is due to the amorphous nature of some of the German parties . The Centrum , to which Chancellor Marx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague principles ; it includes avowed monarchists and virtual Socialists . The decision as to the new Government depends largely upon it . If the Centrum decides to form a coalition with the People 's Party and the Nationalists , who stand to the Right of it , the new Government , despite the trend of the elections , will be more reactionary than its predecessor ; if it throws in its lot with the Socialists , who are now the largest party in the Reichstag , Germany will have a Government pledged , like the present one , to fulfilment of the Dawes program . T HUS THE YEAR ends in Germany with the political situation practically unchanged . Mediocre men compelled to compromise all along the line are simply holding things together . But we have only to think how the welkin would ring with denunciations of the German menace had either the extreme Left or Right taken hold to appreciate how welcome is the present situation for all its temporizing , for all the difficulty of forming a new Cabinet . As it is , calumny is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , we now have a report from the Interallied Commission that Germany is still a menace because she has 400,000 police of one kind or another who would be available militarily in addition to her army of 100,000 men . Grant the 500,000 men ; what could they do ? Every German fort is razed or disarmed ; her coasts are defenseless ; she has admittedly no heavy or siege artillery , no Zeppelins , no bombing planes , no tanks , no rifles for the 500,000 , no automobiles , no general staff , no supply reserves , no piles of ammunition . But what 's the use ? Those who wish to make her out a danger will continue to do so . Has not a member of the Reichstag just produced a book to show that chemically she can wage war  --  and so can any other land that turns to science for destruction of the race . : D ANGER OF A COMMUNIST REVOLUTION in France exists almost exclusively in the minds of the fascist groups who would like to ride into a dictatorship of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.

Now he is out for revenge , and every time a rusty machine-gun is lost or a group of sardine-packers go on strike he and his friends shudder publicly at the menace of bolshevism . Premier H'erriot shuddered with them at first , but now he has gone to the other extreme ; he has ordered the prosecution of the Libert ? for dissemination of false news , and threatens to expel foreign correspondents who send out false alarms . Such action is likely to help the fascist cause ; it never pays to make martyrs . The only country west of Russia where the Communist peril is real is Esthonia , and there it is being drowned in a sea of blood .

C OUNT MICHAEL KAROLYI , according to the Hungarian supreme court , is a traitor . His vast estates , with the ancient castle and many houses and farms , which have been in the hands of the Government throughout the reactionary regime , are finally confiscated ; his private fortune of 10,000,000 gold crowns is seized . Count Karolyi was a pacifist and tried throughout the last years of the war to bring his Government to a negotiated peace . When the revolution swept Hungary he became the head of a liberal republican Government . Inside the country he was opposed by communism and by royalist reaction ; and the Allied Powers did all they could to weaken and discredit this man who had fought the Hapsburgs and opposed the war . Rather than plunge his country into further revolution and civil war , in 1919 Karolyi turned the GovernMeat over to the Communists . But bolshevism was no more to his liking than reaction and , with many of his most intelligent and liberal supporters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was officially declared a traitor by the Horthy Government and his property was confiscated  --  an act which the present verdict merely confirms . Although he is not even charged with offering aid or comfort to the enemy , a new definition of high treason has been made to fit his case . Somewhere in this record of his sympathies and acts , phrased in other words and covered by laws created for the purpose , lies Count Karolyi 's ' treason . " Perhaps to be a democrat and an honest man it is necessary to be a traitor to the Hungary of today . S LOWLY THE ARCHIVES open . First Russia , then Austria and Germany ; and now , hesitatingly , England . Ramsay MacDonald resigned before announcing his policy of uncovering British pre-war diplomacy , but he had taken the first steps in a program which Austen Chamberlain has decided to follow . The British archives , hitherto open only up to 1860 , will be opened without restriction to research historians up to 1878 . This modest decision  --  which , however , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on British policy during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Russo-Turk War of 1878 ? is accompanied by a more interesting program . The Government has asked Harold Temperley , reader in modern history at Cambridge University , and G. P. Gooch , the distinguished author of the " History of Modern Europe 1878-1919 , " to study the records of the decade preceding the outbreak of the war , and to make and edit a selection from them . The selection will be eagerly awaited . Mr. Temper-ley has been an historian of the official school ; Mr. Gooch 's name will carry assurance that documents which might have supported Mr. Morel 's distrust of his own Government will not be reburied. 0 TACKLE THE PROBLEM of automobile accidents at this late day is like locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen  --  or shall we say the garage door after the car has disappeared ? But drivers of motor-cars themselves are awakening to the urgency of the problem  --  partly because of the delays and accidents to their cars . We are glad to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The automobile is the greatest development of twenty years both economically and socially . It is no longer a luxury  --  it is a complete necessity . But if we wish for its fullest development we must reduce its terrors . " This , he added , means that We must find constructive measures to meet the crisis of tens of thousands of deaths , usually with hundreds of thousands of serious personal injuries and millions of property damage , accompanied by an economic loss of some staggering sum such as $600,000,000 . Here is a waste of human lives each year equal to one-third of the American losses by death in the World War and two and one-half times as many casualties as all those suffered by the American forces . ATALITIES DUE TO THE AUTOMOBILE , however , have decreased in recent years when compared with the number of cars in use . Perhaps drivers are more care-ful ; possibly pedestrians are more wary . We have more than three times as many automobiles in the United States to-day as we had when we entered the World War seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents has not quite doubled . The National Conference on Street and Highway Safety recently compiled for Mr. Hoover the following figures , which give at least the pale comfort of knowing that if this much has been done more can be done : deleted table T HE PLAN TO FOIST on the public an issue of $40,000,000 in silver " cartwheels " is to say the least an unreasonable inconvenience to the public and to say the most a-plain impertinence . The scheme is a piece of penny-wise , pound-foolish economy by which government officials expect to make a saving without any sacrifice in their own expense accounts , solely by imposing a burden upon the public . If Mr. Mellon thinks that by his own fiat and a little government propaganda he can popularize the silver dollar he is mistaken . It is too large and heavy a coin to carry in a purse , while put loose in a pocket it soon wears a hole . Mr. Mellon hopes that the public will " cooperate " in his scheme for not printing so many paper dollars . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hopes , otherwise stated , that the public will knuckle under . We hope it will do nothing of the sort but , on the contrary , return Mr. Mellon 's silver dollars to the banks as fast as it gets them . Helpless government employees , we note , are to be paid partially in silver , willy-nilly . We wonder how many silver dollars will be put in Mr. Mellon 's pay envelope . N EW YORK NEVER . KNEW a greater newspaper sen- sation than the famous Sun moon hoax , when , in pre-telegraphic days , that genial paper exercised its fancy with the sights which it reported seen through a new South African telescope . When Percival Lowell , a brother of Harvard 's president , reported canals and life-zones on Mars from his observatory at Flagstaff , Arizona , a quarter-century ago , it seemed as if the desert had driven the good man as mad as a Sun hoax-maker . Wise scientists stepped forth to prove , figures in hand , that life on Mars was an impossibility . For one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freezing-point of water , and life requires more warmth . Lowell , Pickering , Schiaparelli , and others , however , kept their eyes glued to their telescopes , and persisted in seeing beyond the white polar ice-caps broad blue areas as of polar seas , and toward Mars 's equator areas which seemed to indicate the growth and decay of vegetation . Now Messrs . Carl 0 . Lampland and W. W. Coblentz , of the Lowell Observatory , have succeeded in measuring the temperature of Mars . They find , as one might expect , the equator hotter than the poles , the afternoon warmer than the morning , and summer milder than winter . An ordinary summer day shows a range of temperature from 45 ? to 65 ? Fahrenheit  --  quite enough to sustain a rich fauna . But we still know as little of the character of life on Mars as of the geography of that greatest land of mystery , the other side of the moon .                  @ @ @
