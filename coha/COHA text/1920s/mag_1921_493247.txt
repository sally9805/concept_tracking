English Speech and American Masters I remember watching Conrad dig his hands fiercely into the loose sand , and say , " Ah , if only I could write zee English good , well . But you see , you will see ! " . . . There is a foreign inflexion in his speech , never in his prose . . . . And my young literary friends call him Master. ? C. Lewis Hind , in Authors and I. A N anxious problem confronts the lover of the English language these days in the shape of many of our most interesting novels . Can we admit among reputable works of literary art stories so badly written ? Can we admit to the company of Fielding and Thackeray , of Hawthorne and Jane Austen , even of Dickens , writers who at every turn offend our ears with speech not English ? We are ready enough to take seriously a writer who takes himself as seriously as Mr. Dreiser ; we might be a trifle readier if he were a trifle less serious . We recognize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertakes his studies of Philadelphia finance or the Chicago saloon , ? realizing them as American institutions . But we have come to expect that great works of fiction should be at least decently written . And it gives us a shock to find the ambitious author of Sister Carrie falling continually into vulgarisms like , " equally well as " and " He saw where a new play was at the Casino . " Mr. Hergesheimer is one of the authors for whose next story we look with most excitement . We freely acknowledge him as our cleverest entertainer , our most colorful and inventive designer of patterns in the stuff of life . We are forever on the point of yielding ourselves up without reserve to the charm , the wizardry , of his romantic confections . But we are forever being brought up sharp , even in so late a book as Linda Condon , by the evidence that he has not mastered the rudiments of English idiom or of universal rhetoric . Nowhere does a language display its idiosyncrasy more surely than in the use of prepositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withs and bys and cats and tns . He does not seem aware of the fact that we make the pronoun agree in number with its antecedent ( " If she did n't . . . pay the bills every three months when it arrived . . . " ) ; that we use different pronouns for persons and things ( example below ) ; or of a dozen other facts of grammar which every schoolboy knows . He seems fond of a debonair indeterminateness of grammar , as in the sentence : " The gesture of her hands and lifted eyebrows were keenly expressive . . . ; " one might ponder long over the subject of the verb . As for what I call universal rhetoric , what shall we say to such a change of horses in mid-stream ? not to mention anything else ? as in the following not untypical sentence ? " Lithe actresses in a revealing severity of attire , like spoiled nuns with carmine lips , suffering in ingenuous problems of the passions , agonized in shuddering tones ; or else they went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces and dramatic hair , play concertos , that irritated Linda with little shivers of delight . " This is not the way the old masters wrote English . Must we think of Mrs. Wharton and Mr. Cabe11 , as well as Mr. George Moore , as benighted Victorians because they never make these " breaks " ? And which shall we feel worse about , the bad grammar or the lame rhetoric ? The one betrays unprivileged birth , but the other betrays slovenly thinking . Mr. Hardy was not of privileged birth ; and so it came about that the greatest English novelist of his day could occasionally ? oh , rarely ! ? lapse into a vulgar idiom ( " There was an uneasiness in recognizing such ) ; and could sadly misquote , through colloquial ignorance , an exquisite English poet ( " I sat her on my pacing steed " ) . But Mr. Hardy almost invariably says what he means , and what he says invariably makes sense ; whereas the irritating thing about many current novelists is that , through defect of rhetoric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not positively without meaning . It is of course seldom that even Mr. Dreiser makes a bull like this : " He breakfasted as poorly as the night before . " ( If one breakfasts late at night , one surely omits the function altogether on the morning after ! ) And there is little harm in that , except that it makes us laugh in the wrong place . But much more frequent and fatal are the knots in which Mr. Hergesheimer ties himself up , largely through excessive cleverness . Mere theoretical blunders I pass over , misplaced modifiers and necessary words left out . But what intimate faculty of logic has gone wrong for the production of the following ? Referring to women and a certain man ? " In reality he could offer them no help ; their problems ? in a world created more objectively by the hand of man than God ? were singular to themselves . " I have never been able to make out what , in that sentence , is the matter with God , or how he came there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter at bottom is affectation . Half the vulgar errors of Mr. Dreiser come from his pretentiousness , the way he tries to decorate his page with odds and ends suitable , if rightly used , to Indiana oratory of the eighties . It is this which leads him to speak of something as descending upon somebody " without his let or hindrance , " confusing , in the interests of fine writing , the opposed meanings of the word let ; of someone 's being " received without equivocation as a friend and equal " ( meaning without cavil or question ) ; of poisons that in veigh against the system . ( meaning injure ) ; and so on with many another word too tough for his digestion . The affectations of Mr. Hergesheirner are much smarter , and harder to illustrate in small space . It is easy to instance the utters and utterlys that prove so irritating to a placid reader of the earlier books . It is harder to exemplify , or even define , the more offensive affectations in a book like Linda Condon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of cheap perfume at a matinee . Mr. Hergesheimer likes to take on words and tricks of expression which he feels to be subtle or " strong " or re ' cherche , ? large vague words , large vague connections of thought ( a caricature of Henry James or May Sinclair ) , which are doubtless supposed , like the flannels and soft collar of his sculptor Playdon , to suit " the largeness of his being and gestures . " He imagines he is enlarging the scope of expression in English . What is most offensive of all is the air of nonchalance with which he per petrates his barbarities , the insolent parade of carelessness . " In spite of her shrinking , of a half articulate appeal , he crushed her against his face ' Whatever that sic had filled her with hope , she thought , was being torn from her . A sickening aversion over which she had no control made her stark in his arms . The memories of the painted coarse satiety of women and the sly hard men for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) of calculated advances and sordid surrenders , flooded her with a loathing for what she passionately needed to be beautiful . " It must be reluctantly acknowledged that such writing is commoner in American than in English novels . The Swinnertons and the Walpoles are more discreet in their affectations and more nearly immaculate in their rhetoric . Mr. Lawrence 15 seldom guilty of worse than clumsiness . With these writers the style is almost worthy of the idea and the architectural design to which it is applied . The English of Miss Richardson and , Miss Sidgwick is more than adequate to their fide intentions . So that we begin to wonder whether it is not simply our inferior culture that is to blarrie for the untidy appearance so many of our writers present to the world ? is it simply that our Drelsers and our Hergesheimers are not born to the use of English , and that Indiana and Pennsylvania have failed to supply the deficiency ?

It is true that the linguistic complishment of Mr. Conrad is one of the seven Wonders of our time ; but for all that , and in spite 01 the opinion of Mr. Hind , one has but to read a few pages in almost any of his novels to learn that he is far from mastering all the niceties of our idiom . There is , for example , our way of expressing possibility in a subordinate clause after a past tense , hard enough for all foreigners : " It occurred to Captain Mitchell that his position Could ( might ) become disagreeable . " " It did not matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Nostromo . ) It is indeed amusing to watch out , in Conrad , for words and idioms which are direct transferences from the French : " deception " in the sense of " disillusionment " ; " I did my possible " ( Pai fait mon possible ) ; " I felt like a chill grip . " ( comme ) . ( Heart of Darkness . ) But here is just the point where the analogy breaks down . Mr. Conrad makes mistakes in 41glish simply from the ignorance of a foreigner . It is not , like Mr. Dreiser , from bad taste , from taking for model the style of Robert G. Inger- 8 , ? 11 : " The mystic chords which bind and thrill , Irle heart of the nation . . . " ( chords thrill , sure- tY , but it is cords that bind , as Mr. Dreiser shows us in another passage of similar sentiment : " The ItlYstic cords of affection ! How they bind us all .

" the taste is indeed as much as bad grammar : e of the symptoms of inferior culture . But bad taste is one of those crimes for which you can not iv wet a nation ; and we have too many honorable exceptions eions to the prevalence of this sort of bad taste for us to run into hasty generalization ; we Ire , for example , the writing of Miss Cathert " 1 Nebraska ? and that of Mr. Dell ? from ils ? So the case reduces itself to one of indi-41s . But unfortunately the individuals concerned are sometimes persons of account ; and the better taste of Miss Cather and Mr. Dell would give us more comfort if we felt certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hergesheimer . That is why our problem is an anxious one . Mr. Hergesheimer , in particular , is likely to cause many a sleepless night to those of us who take the art of fiction seriously . We should like to hail his books as masterpieces ; we came near doing so with Java Head and The Three Black Pennies . But how can we hail as American masterpieces works not written in the language of these states . JOSEPH WARREN BEACH .
