All the world 's a stage . Last week the U. S. , France and Britain occupied a prominent position before the footlights and sang lustily an opera called " Debts " from the great composer , the World War . <P> Taking the U. S. , Britain , France , Italy , Russia as representing the principal debtor and creditor nations , the debt situation , complex at the best , resolves itself into the following : <P> The U. S. owes nothing . <P> Britain owes the U. S. about $4,500,000,000 . <P> France owes the U. S. about $4,000,000,000 , Britain about $3,000,000,000 . <P> Italy owes the U. S. about $2,100,000,000 , France about $175,000,000 , Britain about $2,750,000,000 . <P> Russia owes the U. S. about $250,000,000 , Britain about $4,500,000,000 , France about $1,250,000,000 , Italy about $7,500,000 . <P> Out of this list of debts ( aggregating the colossal sum of $22,532,500,000-or a little more than a quarter of the total cost of the War ) only $4,600,000,000 has been funded , namely , the debt owed the U. S , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Following Finance Minister Clementel 's presentation to the French Chamber of Deputies of a national balance sheet ( TIME , Jan. 5 ) and his remark made at that time , there arose a great noise from the U. S. Congress . Senators and Representatives took the Finance Minister 's declarations as plainly indicating a policy of repudiation , although M. Clementel had made clear in another part of his speech that " France does not intend to repudiate any contracts . ... " But the U. S. interpretation of the general trend of the French statesman 's speech was comprehensible enough . M. Clementel expected a debt cut , suggested a pooling of resources , compensation-a circuitous way of putting forward repudiation . <P> In Paris , last week , efforts were made by Premier Herriot and Finance Minister Clementel to allay aroused suspicions . The Premier received U.S. Ambassador Myron T. Herrick and M. Clementel received inquisitive U.S. journalists . It became current that the Minister of Finance had merely " mirrored the opinion of the French " in making his now famous statement to the Chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repudiate her obligations . As M. Clementel remarked : " The French position is clear then-France thinks she is entitled to a reduction . If she can not get it , she wishes a moratorium and recognition of ' the necessity of subordinating payments to collections from Germany . ' " It was impossible , he continued , for France to include debt payments in her budget until she had some definite knowledge of the precise terms on which her debts must be funded . <P> Later , a note left the Quai d'Orsay for the U. S. Embassy and Ambassador Herrick cabled the essence of it to the U. S. State Department in Washington . This note was to have been kept secret ; but a leakage occurred and it was bruited about that the French Government had made unofficial suggestions looking toward a debt settlement on the following lines : <P> 1 ) Ten-year moratorium . <P> 2 ) Repayment over 80 years ; this period to be divided into four separate parts , with progressive increases from one period to another . <P> 3 ) Interest at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
