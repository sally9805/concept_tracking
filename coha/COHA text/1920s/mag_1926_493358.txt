Once by the Pacific The shattered water made a misty din , Great waves looked over others coming in , And thought of doing something to the shore That water never did to land before . The clouds were low and hairy in the skies Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes . You could not tell , and yet it looked as if The sand was lucky in being backed by cliff , The cliff in being backed by continent . It looked as if a night of dark intent Was coming , and not only a night , an age . Someone had better be prepared for rage . There would be more than ocean water broken Before God 's last Put out the light was spoken .
