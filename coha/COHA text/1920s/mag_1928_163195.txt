Devices for securing funds for good works are multifarious and strange . None , certainly , is more strange or ingenious than the dinner which will be given , in Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Cleveland , Houston , Los Angeles , Manhattan , Milwaukee . Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , San Francisco , on May 21 , in honor of the Rev. Dr. Henry Pereira Mendes , Founder and Honorary President of the Union of Orthodox Congregations of America . At this dinner , carrying to an extreme the fad for inexpensive banqueting which has been previously evidenced , no food whatever will be served . The guests-10,000 will be invited-will nonetheless pay for their good dinner . The money which they expend will be put into a fund known as " The Rev. Dr. H. Pereira Mendes Educational Endowment , " and used to aid Talmud Torahs ( schools for the children of Orthodox Jews ) , religious schools ( for the children of Reformed Jews ) , and the publication of Jewish textbooks .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
