French and foreign investors scrambled competitively in a buying orgy , last week , when they were finally permitted by white whiskered , confidence inspiring Prime Minister Raymond Poincar to snap up the 5% bonds of his eagerly awaited Consolidation Loan . <P> Within two days ten billion francs ( $400,000,000 ) of new money flowed in ; and six billion francs in other government securities were exchanged for the new issue . Since this latter process- " consolidation " of previous higher interest bearing securities into the new loan-was the end chiefly sought by Prime Minister Poincar , he announced on the second day of scrambling that no further cash subscriptions would be accepted , but welcomed further conversion which continued steadily all week . <P> As announced by M. Poincar , prior to his recent sweeping victory at the general election ( TIME , May 7 ) , the present Conversion Loan is a firm preliminary step toward eventual restoration of the stabilized franc to a gold basis . <P> Encouraging to the Prime Minister was an announcement made at Vichy , last week , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conservatively estimate " the total sum which will be spent in France by U. S. tourists during 1928 at six billion francs ( $240,000,000 ) .
