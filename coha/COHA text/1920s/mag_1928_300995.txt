When John Wilkes Booth shot President Abraham Lincoln it was not possible to accord him the privilege of explaining his deed to the ladies and gentlemen of a radio audience . <P> Pertinent in this connection is the fact that last week the Mexican Ministry of Education put on the air* from Station XFX the notorious assassin Jos de Len Toral , who recently shot General Alvaro Obregon , national hero and President-Elect of Mexico ( TIME , July 30 ) . <P> When captured the assassin was of uncouth appearance , ragged of shirt , scrubby of beard . But when he stepped before the microphone , last week , Jos de Len Toral was not only clean shaven , but clad in black sack coat , double-breasted vest , and trousers of smart pin stripe . Speaking deliberately for two full hours , he explained to the caballeros and seoras of the radio audience minutely how and why he assassinated the President-Elect : <P> " . . . My shots were put into the General Obregon at point blank range . I fire 1 my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <P> " ... I killed him hoping to put an end to the persecution of Catholics in Mexico . . . . " <P> Above the microphone hung a large poster picture of Alvaro Obregon , and upon the further wall a photograph of his widow , children . Everyone in the room smoked incessantly , the audience , the reporters , the nine jurymen and the judge . For what was being broadcast was the trial of Jos de Leon Toral and the nun , who is charged with being his " intellectual accomplice , " Madre Concepcin . <P> Radio listeners thrilled as the assassin said , " Madre Concepcin was merely the final drop of water which caused the overflow of my cup of intention . She had no inkling that I was preparing for my mission . . . . <P> " ... My sole instigation was from God . I am ready to die . He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword . My only thought now is the saving of my soul . ... " <P> Cheers and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico 's most popular criminal lawyer , peerless Demetrio Sodi . In defense of the self confessed assassin Lawyer Sodi argued that his crime was purely political , and as such is punishable by imprisonment only . <P> Came then the smash-sensation . " My client has been foully tortured , " said Demetrio Sodi in a low tense voice . " When he revealed to me what the police had done , I was as nauseated as though I were beholding Dor 's depiction of the infernal cycles of Dante 's Inferno ! I will put my client on the stand . " <P> Then over Station XFX and probably for the first time in history a prisoner described to thousands his sensations under " third degree . " Jos de Leon Toral said tonelessly that he was suspended , swung and jerked by a rope binding his wrists and ankles behind his back , while policemen kicked him and predicted , " He 'll soon sing now ! " <P> " ... I had already and freely said that I shot the General Obregon . All this was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might track down my supposed accomplices . . . . Finally , I told them my name , " thus ending the torture .
