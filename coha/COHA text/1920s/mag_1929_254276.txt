Buffalo this week held its first air show . The event had significance less for number of planes exhibited ( 50 ) and the amounts of planes sold and dealer contracts closed than for two other reasons : <P> 1 ) The Buffalo show , more than the Detroit show , which will occur the second week in April , has international aspects . Detroit has across its international Detroit River only small Windsor in rural Ontario . Buffalo has beyond the Niagara River prosperous Toronto in industrialized Ontario . <P> 2 ) It was the first time that Buffalo had made much boom-boom over its eminence in the aviation industry . Greater New York City last year produced $9,000,000 worth of flying goods in 16 manufacturing plants . Buffalo , eleventh in U.S. population last year produced $4,911,252 worth. * Detroit , fifth city , produced $3,500,000 worth ; Los Angeles , fourth city , $2,750,000 . <P> To the Curtiss Aeroplane &; Motor Co. , Inc. , the Buffalo Chamber of Commerce grants prime importance in the community . President Clement Melville Keys , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and Vice President C. Roy Keys , his brother , have made Curtiss Aeroplane &; Motor one of the largest self-contained units of the industry . Almost all present aircraft concerns make only planes , buy their motors elsewhere . Curtiss manufactures motors as well as ships . Curtiss builds Hawks , Falcons , Condors and Fledglings , all military planes which can be modified for transports and gadabouts . In motors it builds the powerful Challenger and Chieftain , both air-cooled , and the Conqueror and D-12-d , both water-cooled . <P> By building Huskies and other training planes favored by U.S. military forces , Consolidated Aircraft Corp . has attained high rank . President R. H. Fleet and associate executives have recently formed the Fleet Aircraft Corp . to manufacture Huskies , renamed Fleets , for civilian purchase . <P> Less than a year ago General Airplanes Corp . ( A. J. Brandt , president ) , began business in Buffalo . Already it has sold more than $1,000,000 worth of its Aristocrats and Surveyors . It counts on selling $3,000,000 worth this year . Commander Byrd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Charles Ward Hall , president ) , G. Elias &; Bro. , Inc . ( A. J. Elias , president ) , and Eberhart Aeroplane &; Motor Co. , Inc . ( Cleburne Eberhadt , Jr. , president ) , have produced little so far but are experimenting much . <P> * Detroit 's All-American Aircraft Show will display 107 planes , surpassing Chicago 's International Aeronautical Show of last December ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) . Manhattan conducted a much smaller show in February ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . Pittsburgh 's first exhibition a fortnight ago held 23 planes and five gliders , initiated many a sale and agency . Other important air shows this year are scheduled at Indianapolis and Cleveland . The Gardner Annual Trophy Race at St. Louis also functions as a show .
