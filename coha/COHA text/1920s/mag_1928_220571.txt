Wheat jumped from 2 to 3 ? a bushel in Chicago 's Pit last week on rumor that Russia , wheat exporting land , had bought 8,000,000 bushels cash grain in a few days and was in the market for more . An international grain house of the first magnitude refused to be quoted by name in its comment : <P> " The report was exact except in three particulars . It was not Russia but Germany . It was not 8,000,000 bushels but 8,000 . It was not wheat but hops " ( see RUSSIA ) .
