Staccato footfalls beat a brisk tattoo through the city room of the New York World , down the long rows of worn old desks . A big , vociferous typhoon with red hair , blue shirt , trim tailored suit , swept with a round-the-world stride through the office , greeted a dozen reporters by their first names and vanished through a far door , leaving a strange quiet ' behind him . Herbert Bayard Swope , Executive Editor of the World and genius of its flying columns for eight years , was leaving his job . <P> Then in through the door that took the typhoon wafted a mild breeze , smiling slightly , somewhat unfamiliar but with an apparent calm assurance : quick-eyed , with greying hair , quietly energetic , deedy . Ralph E. Renaud , until recently managing editor of the New York Evening Post , went to work at the desk of the departed whirlwind . His duties were to be the same but his title was Managing Editor , not Executive Editor . It was expected that Publisher Ralph Pulitzer would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swope . <P> It was a change to which newspaperdom had been looking forward with curiosity and not without anxiety , for weeks . Some said that with Swope gone the World would feel like a face with all its teeth pulled . A light would be extinguished that nobody else could kindle . There was only one Swope , etc. etc . <P> When it was announced that Renaud had been selected , curiosity and anxiety changed to wonderment . In personality , experience , attitudes , Renaud was reputed an exact antithesis to Swope . <P> Men who had worked with him declared that Renaud was violently anti-Al Smith , while Swope 's lusty voice has long spouted praises of that hapless warrior . Renaud , it was said , had never been able to forget , let alone forgive , the Germans . Swope on the other hand is critical of jingo patriotism . And in religious matters , Renaud was described as uncompromisingly Protestant . The Swopian World 's news columns were always wide open to the Catholics . <P> To these little points Editor Renaud was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have any religious prejudice . I have none . I was bred a Unitarian , but belong to no church . As for the Germans , yes , during the war I was against Germany . I was a loyal American . But since then I 've held no animus . And I did vote for Hoover . But if Mr. Pulitzer were hiring a managing editor on account of his vote , I expect he would n't have hired me . . . . " <P> Quite seriously : " I 'm going to the World as managing editor . A managing editor should be impartial . I imagine I was chosen for the job because I know newspaper work . " <P> Frisco . Whatever effect his opinions might have on the color of the World 's columns , voluntary or involuntary , it was agreed that in all the technicalities of the job Renaud was well equipped to succeed his vociferous predecessor . <P> It was in California , following his graduation from Leland Stanford University in 1903 , that Renaud got his early newspaper training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming dramatic critic for the Bulletin and the Chronicle . In 1912 he went to New York with a letter of introduction from Will Irwin and got a job on the oldtime Globe .
