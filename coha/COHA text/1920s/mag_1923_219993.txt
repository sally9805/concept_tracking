" You must remember that there are sections in China where people are n't interested in the fighting , and . for that matter , do n't even know that there has been a revolution . I do n't doubt that there are thousands of people who do not even know the Emperor has been overthrown . You see , the large majority of Chinamen are n't interested in self-government- have no conception of the idea . So long as things move along smoothly and taxes are n't heavy , they do n't care who rules . " So says a returning traveler from Shanghai . It is true that the Government of China at Peking does as much good as a drop of oil on a stormy sea . It tries to exert its calming influence over the whole 3,913,560 square miles of Chinese territory , but the angry waves of resistance caused by the warlike Tuchuns rapidly dispel the feeble efforts of a still more feeble Government . The Tuchuns-military governors - are literally heads of warring factions . The estimated number of armed men is roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and among an estimated population of 320,650,000 . General Wu , believed by many to be the real hope of China , is a militarist , but his aim is to destroy militarism . This aim is shared by the President , Li Yuan-Hung , but obscure forces make it impossible for Wu and the President to join together against the other Tuchuns . In the South , Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is ostensibly trying to lead a movement to effect the reunification of China . There is one other party that deserves attention and that is the Chang-Tso party , who want a return to the old monarchy . Their political machinations are like the wind , they are felt but not seen .
