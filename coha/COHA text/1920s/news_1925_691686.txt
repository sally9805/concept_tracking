txt Alden H. Little , of Little &; Moore , St. Louis , and chairman of the municipal securities committee of the Investment Bankers Association , was in New York last week . That antagonisms arising from business rivalries are either exaggerated in the public mind or else are forgotten as quickly as they have been aroused is indicated by the appearance recently in an offering c4 an important new issue of names of houses which were supposed to have become bitter enemies through an important industrial transaction which received widespread publicity a few months ago . The probability is that no jealousies were aroused at all but the losing group accepted the situation merely as one of the uncertainties of a business proposition . Offering of the $13,000,000 Stevens Hotel , Chicago , mortgage bonds by such leading organizations at the National City Co. and Harris , Forbes &; Co. created considerable interest in the Street as perhaps indicating some change of policy on the part of both houses . As a matter of fact , both had participated in real estate mortgage issues before and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarking on issuing of that type of securities . The Stevens Hotel issue appealed to them inasmuch as the amount of the bands was less than half the actual cash cost of the land and estimated cost of the building and was not based on appraisals which made it possible to refer to the offering as being a 50% loan . Not all of the big profits in Wall Street are made on stocks and bonds listed on.the " Big Board " or Curb market . A careful scrutiny of the unlisted market sometimes brings to light an issue offering attractive possibilities , a specific instance being that of Schenectady Railway 5s . When attention was called to these bonds about three months ago by Dow , Jones &; Co. , they were selling at 55 . Their possibilities were again pointed out about a month ago when they were selling at G5 and they have since advanced to 79 . Another unlisted issue which offered possibilities was General Railway Signal convertible 61/2s . The bonds are convertible par for par into the stock and both issues were selling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Exchange and its good earnings became known it sold up above 170 carrying the convertible bonds with it .
