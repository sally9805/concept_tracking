The deciding match of the international tennis exhibition series , last week at the Germantown Cricket Club , was between Jean Borotra-Jacques Brugnon of France and George M. Lott Jr . John Hennessey of the U. S. Borotra killed more U. S. lobs than he made errors ; and that was the way the French pair won the match , 6-3 , 3-6 , 8-6 , 6-4 . <P> In the faster singles , Henri Cochet trounced Lott and Borotra was extended to defeat Hennessey . <P> Altogether , France took five matches , the U. S. four . William Tatem Tilden II , of course , did not play ; and Rene Lacoste was far away in France .
