ARMY &; NAVY <P> The findings of the Navy 's court of inquiry on the S-4 disaster , issued last week , were divided into three parts . <P> a ) They found " jointly responsible " for the collision the commanding officers of both ships-dead Lieut . Commander Roy K. Jones of the gored submarine and living Lieut . Commander John S. Baylis of the Coast Guard destroyer Paulding . <P> b ) They found that the Navy would do well to publish more careful charts , to operate submarines less obscurely , to study and acquire better safety and rescue devices . <P> c ) They found , finally , this seeming paradox : that Rear Admiral Frank H. Brumby had been demonstrated unfit to command the Control Force* and should be removed , yet that the rescue plans he approved and supervised " were logical , intelligent , and were diligently executed with good judgment and the greatest possible expedition . " <P> The court of inquiry was composed of two august Rear Admirals ( Jackson and Latimer ) and a Captain and a Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington so soon as their ponderings were published . So sharp were these controversies that Secretary Wilbur hastily ordered the court to reconsider the whole case and report anew . <P> One controversy was the Treasury Department v. the Navy Department . Secretary Mellon wrote a long , tart letter to Secretary Wilbur , reviewing the evidence and refusing to let any blame attach to Coast Guardsman Baylis . A like issue was joined by Navy men in defense of Lieut . Commander Jones . With the Treasury Department on the Paulding 's side and with Jones unhappily dead , one of these arguments seemed academic , the other lamentable and futile . <P> More interesting was the case of Rear Admiral Brumby , on whose behalf it was contended that he had not been technically made a defendant in the trial and that the equivocal findings did not justify censuring him . While the subject of this discussion steamed out of Balboa , Panama , on his flagship , the cruiser Camden , to oversee Control Force maneuvers at the Perlas Islands last week , observers studied the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have puzzled the Navy Department . <P> All that the Court had said , in clumsy , Naval fashion , was that whereas experts had been on hand with good plans and execution , their virtue was not shared by their commander , Rear Admiral Brumby . By good staff work rather than good commanding had that little been done which was done . When the busy pro-Brumbians professed incomprehension of the court 's sentence : " He had not the familiarity with the essential details of construction of submarines and the knowledge of rescue vessels , and the knowledge of the actual work being carried on by his subordinates necessary to direct intelligently the important operations of which he was in charge " - it was apparent that for Navy reasons the pro-Brumbians had chosen to forget certain patches of dialog in the court record , such as the following : <P> " Question : Why did it take so long for air to be started into the compartment ? <P> " Admiral Brumby : I just ca n't be positive about such things . I just ca n't remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the first diver went down on Sunday , December 18 , and heard tappings from the torpedo room , why did he not connect up the air-hose then ?
