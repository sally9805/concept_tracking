Iy there is a diagram of a typical floor plan . From the specifications one learns that the things nearest and dearest the heart of a Greater New York home-maker are these : a folding bed in the door , a radio outlet in the wall , a handball court in the patio , an electric icebox in the kitchen , a dining-table in the alcove , an incinerator in the basement , a cedar closet in the hall , and three golf courses within a few minutes . These are the ten commandments , as the golden leaves of early autumn drop gently to the pavement , and October I draws on apace . TRAVELLING is more fun west of Chicago . Even on the crack extra-price trains , Americans , once they pass the mystic dividing line at Illinois , give themselves up to getting the maximum of comfort and amusement out of their journey , while , this side of the packing houses , they are selfconscious , correct , and over-aware of their fellow passengers . Coming from the Coast on the Overland Limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the compartments , jump off for post cards at Ogden and ice-cream cones at Omaha ; shirt-sleeved gentlemen snore publicly and unabashed through the cornfields of Nebraska and crane for glimpses of air-mail fields . At Chicago the same hot human beings pull themselves together and board the Twentieth Century . It is probably just as hot but the same ladies abandon their sleeveless dresses , get their ensembles pressed by the barber , go into the diner correctly hatted and carrying their gloves ; the same gentlemen sit upright in their seats , show no interest in a passing plane , and discard ice-cream cones for Coronas . The effete East  --  it 's where we belong , but we ca n't avoid a sigh at the admission . TNVESTIGATION to determine A the dreariest job in the world has brought to light the fact that the fence at Woodlawn Cemetery requires painting once a year  --  that is , each paling must be covered with a coat once in every three hundred and sixty-five days . Two men arc employed on the work , and as punctually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . Then they start over again . How these gentlemen celebrate Leap Year is suggested as a topic for Sinclair Lewis ' next book . IT was just such a trivial spark as the arrest of the young rail worker who hooted at Mr. Whalen 's automobile that set off the French Revolution . The imprisonment of a young workman for doing no more than emitting a small catcall at the splendid figure of the Commissioner is an act which mighteasily excite the imagination of the populace . If Mr. Whalen is n't more careful , after him may come the deluge . It might even came during him . That Jl would be terrible . Still it might be fun to watch , if it had to come anyway . THIS new wrinkle the Post Office is getting ready for  --  a special handling service by air and rail  --  means more straws for the camel 's back . Already there is talk of the day when all letters will be carried by plane . What we need is a touch of the good old days when it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quicker the letters go the more there are . There is too much mail now and everybody knows it . For every letter got out of the way , a dozen others rush in to fill the vacuum . It 's like all time-savers : when one linotype displaced seven compositors the newspapers did n't save six-sevenths of their time , or whatever the fraction is ; they just grew six times as fat . At the time that was happening , America got along with a fourth as many postage stamps as now ; in New York the postal receipts have gone up seven times and a half . And what does all this mail say ? The genius , daring , energy , and organizing power of history 's most materially transcendent civilization will be concentrated anew on bringing us a letter with " Personal " printed on it , which we 'll toss aside unfinished when we find it offers us a chance to buy ourselves an automatic electric collar-buttoner .

Trowbridge Elliman , of the real-estate family , was playing golf at East Hampton with his wife , and coming upon a foursome , asked if he might play through . It happened that Mr. Bobby Appleton was a member of this foursome and replied instantly on its behalf . " Certainly , " he said , " anything to appease an ElHim a n . " Furthermore Mr. Ed Wynn was on the beach at Atlantic City last week , near two westerners . " A pretty bird , " said one of them , pointing seaward to the object of his indolent attention . " Yes , " concurred his companion , " it is  --  it 's a gull . " " Well , " said the other , " gull or boy , it 's a pretty bird . " stronger than ever . Dr. Fralick thinks that vocational surgery  --  that 's what he calls it  --  ought to make a member not as good as it was before , but better . In the case of Jack Zivic 's right shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weak spot  --  Dr. Fralick made a deep and difficult incision to shorten and tighten the ligaments . The shoulder was left firm in its socket , firmer than it ever had been . One nick of the circumflex nerve , or any of several other large nerves , would have paralyzed the arm , but there was no such slip-up . Some young surgeons have tried to follow in Dr. Fralick 's steps but they get discouraged , and he has no successful understudies . He wishes he had , for he would much rather specialize in abdominal work , in which he has been really interested ever since moving here from Canada , his birthplace . It is prizefighters mostly who seek him out , but there are others . He once fixed a pianist 's wrist , and he re-made an engineer 's index finger . He got his start on Bob Fitzsimmons after the Fitzsimmons-Jeffries fight in San Fralick THE magazines in Dr. Wilfred G. Fralick 's waiting-room are no better than those in other doctors ' offices , but they have been thumbed by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of lesser pugilists . Dr. Fralick is a specialist in fixing the curious injuries that befall them . Schmeling heard about him in Germany and when he arrived called with a badly bunged-up thumb . The doctor removed a splinter of hone , strengthened the tendons with live tissues , and reinforced the knuckle with cartilage taken from the prizefighter 's ribs . As a result the thumb was THE NEW YORKER 19 Francisco . Fitzsimmons ' hands were the worst he has ever seen , the doctor says . He put them in shape and the fighter sent scores of patients to him afterward . Story of a Slogan FOR years a story has been about that the Reynolds Tobacco Company has just paid some brilliant person a large sum for a new slogan which will startle the whole cigarette-smoking world : " Years ago camels carried wise men ; now wise men carry Camels . " We ourself have encountered this tale several times , at teas , in boathouses , at the Charity Ball . We have been told that the cheque was for five thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told that a college girl thought up the gem , that it was a poverty-stricken poet , that the cheque went to the crippled but exceedingly clever son of a Connecticut politician . We now have the facts , from one of the Reynolds people . The truth is this : The Camel company has had the slogan in the files for five or six years , but has never seen fit to use it . In the meantime people keep sending it in all the time , as their own creation . The company does n't think it is plagiarism , but that it is one of those things which occur to slogan-minded people readily . The legend of the big cheque has grown naturally out of the high hopes and general excitement . Probably the slogan never will be used . Modern Temper NE of those querulous executives , ON a Mr. Mickle , was in a nasty frame of mind the other morning , on account of a compressed-air drill outside his window . He snapped everyone off and demanded impossible things of his assistants , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of his discontent , his secretary told him that a certain important gentleman was waiting to see him . Mr. Miekle flew into a rage . " I ca n't see him  --  I ca n't see him ! " he bawled . " Tell him to go to hell ! ? tell him I said so ! " The secretary started out . " But do n't antag-onize him ! " Mr. 147ickle shouted . New Delmonico 's AT Park Avenue and Fifty-ninth the new thirty-two story Delmonico Building has stood dark , lifeless , unoccupied for a year , unique in this excited city ; flatly uncanny , if you stopped to think of it . It was tied up in lawsuits . Now , on September 15 , it to be opened as the New Delmonico 's . On top is the forty-five-thousand-d o 11 a r-per-annum triplex a par tment , unrented as yet , according to late word . Some of the terraces of this dwelling in the skies are large enough for regulation deck-tennis courts  --  and of course one has been laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's champion deck-tennis player , have played a match on it . The management of the establishment plans to revive some of the Delmonico tradition . Nicholas Sabatini , chef of the old place , closed these six years , will be in charge of the grillroom , and as many of the old Delmonico waiters as can be recruited will be on duty there . ' That is why the grillroom was put in the basement ; the waiters were too old to climb the stairs from the kitchen . So we were told , anyway . At this writing they do n't know whether they will be able to get enough of the old servingmen to make up a complete staff or not . Many of them are unavailable . Charles Groise , one of the most famous of the old captains , was offered a job but refused it . He is running a Coffee Pot in the Elizabeth , New Jersey , market-house . Several of the others are working for Eugene Taupier , general manager at Delmonico 's for years , who has a restaurant at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served three presidents at various times  --  Harrison , McKinley , and Roosevelt . The site of Taupier 's place , incidentally , is that on which Peter and John Delmonico opened their first little restaurant a hundred and two years ago . A bronze plaque has been put on the wall to commemorate this but Taupier keeps it covered because he does n't like to have people staring at it . Jean Colmnbin , a famous chef in the old times , wo n't come out of retirement . Now nearly . eighty , he lives at the Chefs ' Club in West Forty-eighth Street . Everybody probably knows how Louis Napoleon used to dine in Delmonico 's when it was in Beaver Street and , after dinner , clear off the table to practice sleight-of-hand tricks with t h e handsome young actor , James Waliack , and how , in 1861 , at a dinner in the Forty-fourth Street restaurant , Samu er Morse operated a telegraph key on the table and sent the first message by cable to Europe . But Delmonico 's itself took still greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dishes its chefs created . Terrapin was first served at Delmonico 's ; minute steak was suggested by one of its most famous gourmets , Edwin Gould ; lobster ? la Newburg was created by a Delmonico chef , under the guidance of a patron . This gentleman was a famous sea-captain with a taste for good food , and his real name was Captain Ben Wenberg . The dish was , accordingly , christened " Lobster a la Wenberg , " and was so known until the mariner had a row with Charles Delmonico and left the restaurant never to return . To get even , Delmonico transposed a couple of letters and time did the rest . It emerged " Lobster a la Newburg . " Bold ATRAFFIC policeman of lower Broadway had to make out a particularly distressing report concerning a happening near his post last Wednesday . He saw a young man removing a spare tire from a runabout at the curb and went over and demanded to know what he was doing . " I 'm stealing this tire  --  what do you suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , deciding he had been a bit too heroic , wandered hack to his post . The other wandered down the street with the tire . A few minutes later the owner of the car showed up , and rushed out to tell the policeman that his spare was gone . Golf COME day the members of the score 1 ,  --  ) or two golf clubs near the city will erect a tablet to the late Mr. Robert SEPTEMPER 7 , 9 2 9 Lockhart , but not many of them now have heard of him . He it was who introduced the game to these parts . The year was 1888 and the place was Central Park . During the summer of 1887 Mr. Lockhart , at that time a linen merchant , revisited his birthplace , Mussel-burgh , Scotland , and there he gave out that his only objection to life in America was that the people had never heard of golf . This occasioned exclamations and , when he left , his friends presented him with a fine new set of clubs in a plaid hag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given him six sets of golf clubs . There are two versions and we do n't know which is correct . At any rate , on an afternoon in the spring of 1888 , Mr. Lockhart appeared in Central Park with a plaid bag and a set of sticks , dropped a ball on the grass , and drove it whizzing down the meadow . A group of small boys was pleased but some old ladies were terrified . They did n't know what he was doing , but they thought it must be wrong , and they called a policeman . The great pioneer wound up in the police station . There being no golf then , there were no regulations against it , and he was released with a warningnot to knock the ball around in the Park any more . This turned out a blessing , fur the incident attracted sufficient attention to cause half a dozen other golfers to seek out Mr. Lockhart . Thus came about the first golf club . One of the players who turned up offered his stable in Yonkers as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the group , having grown to thirty , incorporated , bought thirty-six acres at the foot of Palisade Avenue , and laid out a course . Their official name was the St. Andrews Golf Club , but they were more familiarly known as the Apple Tree Gang , this because of an old apple tree growing near the first tee which for a long time served as a consolidated clubhouse , bar , and grillroom . Club meetings were held beneath the boughs , from which also were usually suspended a basket of sandwiches and a demijohn of whiskey . In 1891 the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club engaged Stanford White to draw up plans for a clubhouse and sheds for horses , and three years later the St. Andrews Club itself moved to larger quarters at Mt . Hope , above Yonkers . Though they left the apple tree , they apparently brought along the demijohn , for among thefirst expenses listed after moving is the item : " $1.25 , for one cork --  screw . " The apple tree is still blooming , on ' a private estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilgrimage to view the famous tree . In 1923 , with appropriate ceremony , the American Ambassador to Great Britain presented to the Prince of Wales , in his capacity as honorary Captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews , a twig , encased in silver , from its boughs . Dial It Again , Please JUST as everybody expected , the dial telephones have developed certain difficulties . One of the principal ones is psychological . Calling Pennsylvania numbers , people dial " PENN " instead of " PEN . " Now dialing the second " n " is really dialing " 6 , " which has been particularly bad in the case of calls for the Pennsylvania Hotel , PEN 5000 . People dialed " PENN " and got PEN 6500 , the Hotel Association . This was fairly close , but not close enough . The association was so greatly bothered that it got its number changed , and the old one was vacated . Illiterates and people who do n't stop to think have 00.01. ? trouble with Stuyvesant . They dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season everybody concerned is annoyed . Amenity ARATHER unimportant-looking little man , holding an unlighted cigarette , accosted an elegant gentleman in the lobby of a theatre and asked him for a match . The gentleman was annoyed , but began to search his pockets in a bored way , and at length brought one forth . " I do n't want to take your last match , " said the little man , apologetically . " Quite all right , " replied the other , " I have a lighter . " Holographs and Such QUITE a while ago we printed some notes on the autograph-collecting situation , mentioning that Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach 's payment of fifty-one thousand dollars for a Button Gwinnett was the record price for an autograph . The Gwinnett excitement has died down now and the collectors have resumed the even tenor of their ways , although keeping abreast of the situation . There is , and has been for some time since before the last presidential election , a fairly active demand for Hoover and Smith holographs , that is , letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarer than a Hoover . Harding holographs are fairly rare , because no one thought to save his letters before he was suddenly hurled into national fame by being nominated . They bring around forty dollars , twice as much as Jeffersons , Madisons , or Monroes . ( One can get a Buchanan or a Chester A. Arthur for ten dollars  --  maybe three for twenty-five . ) The typewriter is what makes holographs scarce nowadays , but even though Harding did n't write voluminously with a pen , conservative collectors believe that his longhand letters bring too much , probably owing to a spirit of sentimentality in t h e market . Madigan 's signature and manuscript shop , at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-fourth Street , has a Mrs. Harding quoted at twenty dollars , which puts her on a par with Dolly Madison . Content as much as scarcity governs the price of letters , documents , and so on . Bernard Shaws range from as low as twenty-five dollars to as high as five hundred dollars  --  the largest price ever paid for the holograph of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who write him provocative letters , fishing for replies . It 's an old trick and Shaw is rarely taken in . Mr. Madigan 's collection includes letters and documents signed by about every celebrity one can think of from Henry VIII to Mary Baker Eddy . He is proud of some particularly rare signatures ? Camille Dcsmoulins ( $375 ) , La Fontaine , the French poet and fabulist ( $275 ) . Dead men and ladies are of course in the majority , but an assortment of living statesmen , authors , and soldiers can be had  --  Mussolini , Taft , Tarkington , Gals-worthy , Hindenburg , Ludendorff , Pershing . Madigan has lots of soldiers . Some collectors are crazy about them , and go in for forgotten brigadiers of the American wars . The pens of some of the generals were mightier than their swords . A letter of George E. Pickett , of Pickett 's Charge fame , is quoted at $150 ? higher than the letters of any of the rest  --  with Custer next , at $65 ; Lee , $25 ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pershing , $7.50 to $10 . Harding once wrote that a president never writes a letter which is read solely by the one to whom it is addressed . That goes for others than presidents . The late Secretary Lansing , who wrote some pretty stuffy diplomatic documents , is represented at Madigan 's by an amusing water-color sketch of five Christmas stockings , done at the bottom of a letter to a young relative , together with this verse : Our styles are various , Our mood hilarious , We are usually " out of sight ; " We are out for a fling , We wo n't do a thing , But all get full tonight . Resourcefulness PrCVO nervous young men , with just time enough to get their tickets and catch the midnight for Boston , commanded a Red Cap in Grand Central to get them two ham sandwiches and a bottle of ginger ale , quick . In the bag of one of them was a bottle of Scotch and they thought to have a nightcap or two . The Red Cap caught the gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get any ginger ale , Boss , " he said , " so I brought a bottle of milk . "
