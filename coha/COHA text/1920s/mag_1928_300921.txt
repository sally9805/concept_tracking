<P> Altogether awesome and holy is the small area circumferenced by the ruins of King Solomon 's Temple in Jerusalem . A Mohammedan can enter and behold the golden urn in which repose two hairs from the beard of the True Prophet . A Christian may adore the stone on which Jesus found miraculously inscribed , the name of his Father In Heaven ( " Shem " ) , by pronouncing which he worked miracles . Jews can see the place where Abraham was stayed by the Angel 's hand from offering up Isaac . Nearby is the Coffin of Mohammed , adorned with 17 golden nails . It is written that when they all fall out the World will come to an end . Furthermore by listening at the Sacred Stone one may still hear the subsiding waters of the Biblical Flood . All these things and beliefs , hallowed legend sanctifies . <P> But perhaps holiest of all in the vicinity of the temple ruins is the Wailing Wall , at which Jews constantly assemble to wail as follows : <P> Leader : " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . we sit in solitude and mourn ! <P> Leader : " For the Temple that is destroyed . . . <P> Wailers : " . . . we sit in solitude and mourn ! <P> Leader : " For our Majesty that is departed . . . <P> Wailers : " . . . we sit in solitude and mourn ! <P> Leader : " For our Great Men who lie dead . . . <P> Wailers : " . . . we sit in solitude and mourn ! <P> Leader : " For the Priests who have stumbled . . . <P> Wailers : " . . . we sit in solitude and mourn ! <P> Leader : " FOR OUR KINGS WHO HAVE DESPISED HIM . . . <P> Wailers : " . . . we sit in solitude and mourn ! " <P> Such wailing has gone reverently on for centuries and it is only recently that the Anglo-Arab police have interfered ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) . Last week their action in driving Jews away from the Wailing Wall was described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unperturbed , the Anglo-Arab police prepared to keep the Jews at bay While the Mohammedan owners of the Wall proceed to lay an extra course or two of stone upon it-seemingly with no other purpose than to render all Jewry aghast at the sacrilege . <P> Since the Mohammedans are perfectly within their legal rights , an extreme recourse was resorted to last week , by Abraham Isaac Kook . Chief Rabbi of Palestine . Weeping copious tears Colonel* Kook decreed a general fast day and renewed mourning by all Jews . <P> Correspondents found the Colonel in a state of extreme despondency . When he visited the U. S. in 1924 ( TIME , March 31 , 1924 ) he jocularly remarked that " the English in Palestine are no Angels " ; but last week he appeared to have revised this opinion for the worse . Brooding behind his Muscovite halo of whiskers . Colonel Kook muttered , " The end is near ! How can we endure that they desecrate the Wall ? " <P> Sympathetic friends of Colonel Kook recalled his strange , inspired career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Jerusalem . But stronger was the twinge of local duty , and he reluctantly became Rabbi of Busk , Russia . Some 20 years ago , however , he was appointed Rabbi of Jaffa , and hastened happily to Palestine . Today all Jewry regards Colone1 Kook as a sort of philosopher-saint . <P> Therefore Jews throughout the world heeded the call of Colonel Kook , last week , fasted for a day , mourned exceedingly . <P> <P> * Courtesy title
