The U. S. Golf Association announced the appointment of Robert A. Gardner ( National Amateur Champion , 1909 and 1915 ) as captain of the Walker Cup team , which will meet a golf team from Britain on or about Sept. 12 and 13 . <P> This is the second successive year that Gardner will have captained the American amateurs who are to defend the Walker Golf trophy against the invading British . <P> The U. S. G. A. approved the steel shaft for all championship tournaments . The steel shaft actually affords no advantage over the hickory ; but the rapid growth of the popularity of golf was said to have forced some dishonest manufacturers to use unseasoned hickory ; and the Association , after exhaustive tests , decided to approve the steel shafts , recommended by its Implement and Ball Committee , in order to eliminate the necessity of buying from unscrupulous dealers .
