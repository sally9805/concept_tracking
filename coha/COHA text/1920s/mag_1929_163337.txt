Long have mail-order houses like Sears , Roebuck &; Co. and Montgomery Ward &; Co. , sold by mail tires and other automotive accessories . Last week Sears , Roebuck decided to sell the automobile itself . Details concerning price and type of car had not been decided . Announcement was made , however , that the car would be manufactured by Gardner Motor Co. , Inc. * and that Sears , Roebuck &; Co. would distribute it . <P> Montgomery Ward &; Co. is also considering marketing an automobile . Automotive bystanders , hearing that General Motors was experimenting with a small , airplane-motored automobile priced around $250 , to be shipped in a box which would serve also as its garage , linked this rumored " aero-car " with the Montgomery Ward story . General Motors offices belittled the story , said that with 30,000 G. M. dealers there was no need for mailorder distribution of General Motors products . Asked whether General Motors was planning a car of the type described , the reply was that General Motors had so many experimental projects , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignify with a denial every report that reached its ears . <P> While U. S. automobile men were planning small cars , an English automobile man was announcing the invasion of the U. S. market with a small English car . The invader was Sir Herbert Austin ; the car the Austin Seven . The Austin will be manufactured at Butler , Pa. , by a U. S. branch of Austin Motor Co . <P> The Austin is a sort of British Ford . The Seven does not , of course , refer to cylinders but to horsepower . The Austin is only 9 ft. 2 in. long , 3 ft. 10 in. wide and weighs only 950 lbs . Production date and price have not been announced , but it is understood that the Austin will sell for less than $500 . Financing of the U. S. company will be handled by Bulkley , Vallance &; Co. , of Manhattan . <P> The Austin represents the first serious foreign attempt at competing with the U. S. motor car . Said Samuel H. Vallance : " We are not proceeding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cars . . . but in size and economy of operation the Austin Seven is in a class by itself . " <P> <P> * It is the Gardner company which will manufacture the new Ruxton front-wheel-drive automobile ( TIME , June 10 ) .
