Louis XIV-C . S. Forester-Dodd , Mead ( $4 ) . <P> Every day for over half a century , Louis XIV , every inch a king , played slave to . etiquette . Epitome of the day 's procedure was his royal arising , witnessed daily by some 300 fawning souls .

The third order then entered to see the king shave and put on his wig . And last came the final rabble of cardinals , marshals , courtiers , to observe the rest of the ceremony : royal breeches and hose , royal shirt by way of the First Valet of the Wardrobe , to the Grand Master of the Wardrobe , to the Dauphin , to the King . " At this crucial moment , while the nightshirt was off and the day-shirt not yet on , one little concession was made to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dressing gown as a screen . . . .

Excellently planned , the military campaign against William of Orange , and the diplomatic war for the Spanish succession , were both on the verge of sensational success , when Louis stopped to evolve an elaborate finish , instead of clinching matters offhand . <P> The palaces at Versailles are reminiscent of glittering splendor and jewelled magnificence during the Sun King 's reign .
