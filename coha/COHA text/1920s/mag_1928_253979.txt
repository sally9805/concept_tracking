Seven years ago , Franklin Delano Roosevelt was struck down in his prime ( aged 40 ) by infantile paralysis . He fought back , not only at his own crippled condition but at the effects of the disease upon others . The Georgia Warm Springs Foundation Hospital at Warm Springs in Georgia , is largely his work and his energy encouraged notable developments in restorative therapy . <P> Last week Mr. Roosevelt squared off at life afresh and made an announcement . He could get along without his crutches now , he said , though he still needs two canes . He resigned from other companies and from the American Construction council-on which he had served since 1923 is a sort of chief morale officer to the building trades-to devote himself fully to his Fidelity &; Deposit Co. and his American Bonding Co. , to his Manhattan law firm ( Roosevelt &; O'Connor ) and to the presidential candidacy of his friend , Governor Alfred Emanuel Smith of New York , whose pre-convention campaign of 1924 he managed from the confines of a wheel chair . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
