IT 'S cooler ; people are coming back to town . Even the thoughts you have are cooler . Meadow Brook is a cool name , and the gentility of polo is a refreshing thought  --  cool boxes occupied by cool people . It 's possible to sleep in town , and first-night audiences are beginning to be dressy . We heard a mosquito the other night in the apartment , but he was weak and hardly fought back . In Washington Square a yellow leaf drops to the bench below with a slight rustle of September . In sheltered harbors of the Sound yachtsmen sit on the cool decks of their sloops , riding at anchor , sifting the difference in fall breezes , resolving not to lay up till the last possible moment . Sunflowers have gone to seed in country places . FREE as a lark we drove down Sixth Avenue the other morning without benefit of traffic lights . The red and green omens were under some strange electrical disturbance which permitted all lights to be on at once  --  both red and green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy traveller could take his pick , and did . We picked green and so did everybody else . It was a halcyon time , sweetly illegal and good . For ten merry minutes we buzzed along , getting just where we wanted to go ; motorists buzzed out of side streets , getting just where they wanted to go . Then , without a word , a great far-reaching repair was made somewhere and the lights commenced to function as intended . Immediately a traffic jam resulted at every crosstown intersection . THESE are prosperous times , and to many people the problem of life is not how to gain success but how to go on living after there is nothing more to live for . Men turn to golf ; women turn to other men ; almost everybody turns to psychoanalysts ; book publishers turn to H. G. Wells ; a few people turn to God . A great restlessness seems to have got hold of this part of the world , and much of it is due to financial competence . There must be some way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of serious thought , we have decided to suggest a twofold plan , as follows : First , money should not bear interest . That would eliminate the parasitical people who live on past performances . It would do away with banks , for there would be no loans or securities or stock promotion , only hunting and fishing . Second , money itself should be made very cumbersome so that it would be irksome to have around one 's person and disagreeable to have around the place . It should be heavy , and slippery , and have an unpleasant odor . We feel that this reform would greatly strengthen the state , solidify the home , put women back where they belong , promote the sterner virtues , effect a return to the soil , abet godliness , and possibly elect a Democratic president . THE chewing gum named for this magazine has at last come to our attention . New Yorkers is the name , and we are somewhat dismayed to note that it is a gum with a purpose . Gone are the lucky days when goodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ; when any kind of dissipation was enjoyed for its own sake . Now , every dissipation , whether major or minor , whether dismal or Rexall , is purposeful . New Yorkers gum is made with milk of magnesia , which neutralizes mouth acids . We feel we should reiterate that the magazine itself has no mission . Samaritan OO a subway train late one night a tipsy youth toppled from his seat and a kind , elderly gentleman we know rendered aid . He helped him to his feet , and when the next station was reached , to the sidewalk . Arriving there , he learned that his charge was a sailor on a merchantman . The fellow could n't remember the whereabouts of his ship so our friend called a cab . He knew little about sailors and their retreats , and he tried several hotels and a Y.M.C.A. without finding one willing to extend hospitality . The taxi-driver , possibly with an eye to business , suggested a lodging house in the Bowery , and thither the gentleman delivered the sailor , paying thirty-five cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 28 scribed " Sorry " when he hits the net cord with a ball that wobbles over and is good . He laughs and says he tried that shot , or remarks that it 's a gift . He seldom loses his temper , but not long ago during practice he got mad be- cause he had failed in three or four shots and hurled his racquet into the backstop . For years he insisted on wearing a pair of old striped flannel trousers . It was n't until they were received with surprise and shock at austere Wimble- don that he went cut sadly and bought new white ones . with a suggestion that the youth phone him at his office on the morrow . The next day the sailor telephoned and awkwardly asked if he might call . He was asked to do so and shortly he appeared . He had lost his job for failure to be back at his post . After announcing this he paused , twisted his hat , and then blurted out , " You see , the fact is  --  seeing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back my pocket-book ? " Rollicking Hoosier HENNES , SEY , the tennis star , lives in Indianapolis , where he began to play tennis when he was thirteen , which was about fifteen years ago . Until a year or two ago he had appeared in the East but once or twice because he could n't take enough time from his in- surance business to get around to larger tournaments . In 1924 , however , he got away long enough to defeat Borotra in the national championship , which earned him a ranking as No. 7 in the national lists . Placed as far down as sixty-fifth in 1918 , he had got up to twenty-fourth in 1920 . After two years out of the game , for insurance 's sake , he came back last year , beat Cochet , and was ranked fifth nationally . This year he has managed to give virtually all his time to tennis because people in Indianapolis , where he is an idol , consider it an honor to take out policies with the Davis Cup star , and waive sales talks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swag-gers about the court in such a way that many believe he is a strong , husky fel-low . As a matter of fact his air is largely due to fallen arches . He weighs only one hundred and fifty-five pounds and lack of physical strength handicapped him for years . He at-tributes his present good condition to Mr. Bill O'Brien , trainer with the Davis Cup team . O'Brien did wonders for the star 's feet , the care of which he took over at a time when Hennessey was forced to walk flat-footed . O'Brien also put him on a diet and showed him how to build up his muscles . During a game Hennessey carries good humor to the point of banter . Before the recent national doubles finals , Lott was practicing volleys with the French team when Hennessey ap-peared , late . The crowd , with which he is always popular , cheered and ap-plauded . Hennessey grinned and then joined in the applause . If a player calls back at him " Good shot ! , " Hennessey often frankly admits it with a genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preSo Runs the World Away PEOPLE who wait for buses on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-sixth Street often kill time by looking into the win-dow of the Postal Telegraph Com-pany to see a globe- map of the world revolve , just like the world itself . We know a fellow who has done this often lately and who the other evening suddenly realized that something was wrong . The globe was revolving in the wrong direction . He rushed in and told a clerk about it , explaining that if the earth really twirled as indicated the sun would rise in the west , frightening horses , little children , and policemen . The clerk said that practically every- body had dropped in to tell them about it but that the management had taken no action . Last Word LAST week we had a look at the larg-est apartment we have heard of in the city . It is an amazing forty-one room duplex in the new coOperative building at 1060 Fifth Avenue . The real-estate people , the builders , and so on , like to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr. John Markle , who is reputed to have made his fortune in coal at Wilkes-Barre and who now wishes to retire quietly into the reaches of this new home . Inquisitive souls have not , we hear , been able to draw Mr. Markle out as to why he wants so much room , as he lives alone with his servants . One would presume that he has a sufficient number of these , as eighteen rooms have been set aside for their use . The walls of the apartment are THE NEW YORKER 19 panelled in imported antique oak , pine , and other woods , much of the decoration is marble , and there is a great commanding staircase of wrought iron and bronze . The purchase price was three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars but the cost of alterations , decorating , and so forth will bring the total cost to nearly a million dollars . Mr. Markle will have sundry little conveniences , one of them a private telephone switchboard with twenty-six extension phones . Down the Avenue from this new building , at 960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a dozen fewer rooms than Mr. Markle 's but which brought a higher sales price . It belongs to Dr. Preston Pope Satterwhite and , from the top two floors of the building , commands that lovely prospect of Central Park for the enjoyment of which the late Senator Clark paid seven million dollars . His famous mansion stood at this corner , Seventy-seventh Street , for three decades , until it was torn down a couple of years ago . The building which now supplants it will carry on the fine old tradition of millions for a view of grass and trees . The floors were deep in plaster and laths the day we were there , whistling workmen shuffled about , and a plinth for an agate lamp or a marble figure supported only an empty , unwashed milk bottle . But the grandeur of the place could be foreseen . The ceiling of the living-room is twenty-two feet high and tall windows reach to within two feet of it . Nothing was lacking to make it seem like a hall at Versailles except the playing of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same building is a penthouse with eighteen rooms . We were duly awed , even though we rode up to it in a work elevator with two wheelbarrows filled with sand . It flaunts defiance to the proud adjacent skyline , which meets the challenge , so far as our eye could see , with nothing nearly so immense . Thus in lonely splendor sits the roof estate of the late James Cox Brady . He bought this place shortly before his death . Now offered for sale by his estate , it will be finished in November . September Scene SHORTLY after the sun came up 5-1 on Park Avenue one morning , a haughty attendant at one of the big apartment houses saw a woman prowling about among the rubbish cans , a witch-like lady . " Here , here , what are you doing there ? " he demanded . The woman looked up with a reassuring smile and explained , " I 'm just looking for a novelty for a friend . " J. Coogan WE phoned Jackie Coogan last week , but they said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paramount and saw him in person . Jackie and his father , who left vaudeville nine years ago to manage his son , do a routine together while Mrs. Coogan waits in the wings . Jackie is thirteen now , is allowed twenty dollars a week , and has a pretty " Just a minute , dearie , until I shut off Herbert Hoover . " good time running up and down-stairs in a kind of Publix frenzy . His mother says he is a good boy , but quite a spendthrift . " I do n't know where his money goes . He somehow gets rid of his whole allowance . " The racial characteristics of the Coogan family are in a somewhat uncertain state . There 's talk of a Jesuit college for Jackie , there 's a manager named Bernstein , and the youngest Coogan  --  a three-year-old named Robert  --  talks with a German accent which he gets from his Swiss nurse . Robert is just getting over whooping cough , and is outlawed from society at present . There is no talk about his being groomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coogan emotional tendencies : his mother says he often prays vehemently , falling to his baby knees and asking Divine help for other people who are in trouble . " Oh , God , " the little tot moans , " take away Mother 's headache . " He is always full either of praise or condolence , which greatly pleases Mrs. Coogan , who likes children . Jackie was reading Zit 's Weekly when we dropped into his dressing-room . He was in a striped robe ( much of his life has been spent in dressing-rooms ) , his hair was slicked , pompa-dour style , and white spats were visible of his costume . He speaks in Penrod voice , and is a goodlooking young blade , with a natural precocity , a normal amount of conceit , and a rather likable manner . In the middle of a conversation , he dashed downstairs , turned around , and dashed loudly up again , which set us at our ease . Meanwhile Father Coogan , also in white spats , had entertained us with stories of shooting mountain lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in golf , likes swim-ming best of all , is in second-year high school , dislikes algebra , lives at the Warwick while in New York , and enjoys manufacturing paper airplanes and throwing them from a high win-dow . He has read Shakespeare but likes Western pictures better . The father-and-son personal appearance proved rather a shock to an audience who remembered Jackie best fur the many warm tears he had shed over numberless dying cinema parents . When the blue velvet Paramount curtain parted , father and son came forward dressed identically in morning coats , top hats , white vests , and white spats  --  a costume , Mr. Coogan said , which he hit upon one day in Los Angeles while reading a copy of THE NEW YORKER . Rules ALTHOUGH you can find out to a split second what time it is by calling Meridian 1212 , the matter stops right there . A drowsy friend of ours , waking from fitful dreams one morning last week , picked up his bed-phone to set himself straight . " This is Meridian 1212 , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ten . " " But , " put in our friend quickly , " can you tell me what ( lay this is ? " " I 'm sorry , " she said , " but we are not allowed to give out that information . " At exactly ten minutes past ten he slumped hack under the covers and went to sleep again . Time Out MR . TED LEavis , the jazz hand leader , once trouped through the Middle West with a small repertory company which presented a different show every night in the week . His job was to act as prompter and in addition play the clarinet between acts while the scenery was being shifted . One night , soon after the start of the performance , an actor forgot his lines . Failing to get the expected help from the prompter , he invented a few lines , maneuvered toward the wings , and in a pleading undertone asked , " What 's the line ? " To this , Lewis , fumbling over a whole lapful of scripts , called back , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a blind newsdealer in the Yorkville section an elderly man appears morning and evening to buy a paper , each time laying down in payment for it a dime instead of the customary two or three cents . The story behind this is that he once bought a paper there , and not knowing of the dealer 's affliction , berated him for being slow in making change . Chancing into thestand a few days later , he noticed a sign on the wall stating that the proprietor of the shop was sightless . Since then he has paid ten cents for his papers . A lady who has been working among the blind informs us that there are some forty newsdealers in the city who can not see and that last spring they formed a protective association which is ed by the New York Asso-sponsor ciation for the Blind and has headquarters at The Lighthouse in East Fifty-ninth Street . This society helps them get stands and licenses , schools them in business , and protects them from stray newsboys who might peddle papers too near their stands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , founded fifteen years ago . They are better at their job than men who can see , because their sense of hearing is more highly developed . Flying School miles down the Long Island Motor Parkway from Curtiss Field people sit in automobiles and wait for airplanes to hit the ground . At this point the Curtiss people have a field for student fliers to practice landing . Airplanes go up , alight , bounce , and go up again every few minutes . Motorists go there in the mixed fear and hope of seeing a mishap . Even minor accidents are very rare , however , although three hundred pupils are under instruction in the Curtiss school . There are more preliminaries to learning to fly than merely paying three hundred dollars for ten hours ' instruction . Applicants must pass a medical examination . The Division of Airways now licenses doctors , at all principal fields where aviation is taught , to see to this . Next to a sturdy heart , keen vision is the chief requirement . Tc test his eyesight , the applicant sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manipulates a small vertical bar on a table across the room . The bar moves in a groove and the object is to pull it forward or backward until it is precisely abreast of a stationary bar fixed on the table . If the applicant does n't get the two bars pretty nearly even in three attempts , he is disqualified . The war-time business of whirling a man in a revolving swing-chair to see if he became dizzy has been abandoned . They have found out it did n't prove anything . A student we interviewed said that when he applied for enrollment he did very well with the bars , and was told to go out to the line of planes waiting for flights . It was all quite casual . He was given the name of an instructor and told to report to him . He had to hunt for this man , whom he finally found off at one side of the field eating a hot dog . This teacher of fledglings , with but the preliminary of a perfunctory handshake , began his work immediate-ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a little of this he told the novice to get in the plane , and off they went aloft . The student was in the air half an hour after his enrollment , not counting out the time he spent hunting up the instructor . The planes have dual controls ; the student sits behind the pilot . Some instructors give advice and orders through tubes connected with earphones in the student 's helmet . Others use hand and arm signals . A beginner should be able to fly alone after a dozen or two flights of half an hour each . During the war , fliers were often put on their own in half that time . Fred Stone had hardly been graduated when he crashed recently . Up-to-the-minute planes are now available for training , but the old army planes called Jennies are still being used . A Curtiss student must make one flight in a jenny before he is turned loose on his own . If he can fly a Jenny it is presumed that he can fly anything . Much attention is given to landing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beginners are taught how to get a plane out of a spinning dive from high altitudes . In a spinning dive the plane drops straight for earth , whirling like a top . It seems that you just straighten everything and the whirling stops ; then with a simple pull on something , the machine rights itself . Acrobatic stunts , night flying , and the like are taught in a fifty-hour course which costs eight hundred dollars . The large number of people we meet or hear about who are learning to fly and are buying planes , or talking about it , led us to our present investigation . Pilots unquestionably are being developed by the thousands , In addition to the Curtiss school , there are several others at Curtiss Field , all with large classes , and there are similar schools at Roosevelt Field , Hadley Field in New Jersey , and at Armonk in Westchester County , among other places . All over the country people are learning to fly . We heard an interesting account of a flight by Mr. Levine at Curtiss Field this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its wings nearer the vertical than the horizontal . Half the mechanics on the held rushed out in alarm . Levine righted the plane , to their surprise , and zoomed on up . Soon , however , an accomplished plot , who had witnessed the incident from above , landed quietly and let Mr. Levine have the sky to himself . Charm FROM time to time we have noted a groping toward the elegance of the old French salons in the conduct of movie houses , shoe stores , and the like . The latest contribution to tone in business is the abolition , in the building at 383 Madison Avenue , of the uncouth old phrases " going tip " and " going down " as applied to elevators . Here the coo rtly operators announce " ascending " and " descending . "
