 | THE MOON IN LITERATURE THE moon is a satellite , or secondary planet , revolving about the earth in an elliptic orbit inclined 5 ? 8 ' 48 " to the ecliptic , and doing the trip in 27 days , 7 hours , 43 minutes , 11-461 seconds . Its average distance from the earth is 238 , - 833 miles , and any scientist will be able to supply the number of odd feet and inches . Its volume is , roughly , one fiftieth , and its weight one eightieth of that of our own globe . The moon is airless , waterless , lifeless ? a corpse of a R orld ; and its principal glory is ( as the ladies say ) not her own . ' The total surface visible to us is approximately twice the size of Europe , and one must picture it as a barren continent of peak and precipice , crag and crater , with mountains standing fang - like in frozen light , and valleys plunged in utter blackness . There is no bush or tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of bird or beast ; no chuckle of water , or whine of midge . The petrified silence threatens to burst the eardrums . Such is the moon of astronomy ? a veritable nightmare , the horror of which makes Dante 's Infernos appear comparatively endurable . To dismiss the moon in this fashion is very much like dismissing one of Rodin 's statues as so many hundredweight of calcium carbonate . The moon is a silver shield , a celestial halo , the lamp of heaven , a fairy godmother , an enchantress , a goddess ? Luna , Astarte , Isis , Phoebe ( gentle sister of the ardent sun ) , or Diana ( who still bathes in forest pools ) . This is the moon of our human acquaintance , the moon of Egyptian and Druidical worship , the moon that shines through poetry . and romance , that illumines life and literature . The astronomer 's conception may be the ultimate fact , but fact is dead : the poet 's vision is truth , and truth is alive . The moon may be ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthquakes ; but the important thing about her is that she shares our secrets ? secrets that are too good to tell . The moon may be 600,000 times less brilliant than the sun . If so , it matters nothing . The vital difference between them is that the sun is epic while the moon is lyric . The textbooks assure us that the sun is 65 , - 000,000 times the size of the moon ? a triviality hardly worth the trouble of calculating . The supreme point is that the sun is masculine and the moon feminine . .. The man who denies it is a miserable literalist , and deserves a professorship at a Prussian university . The sun gives light ; the moon gives illusion . The sun gives so much light that there is little room left for imagination . We do not easily make legends about the sun ; but the moon keeps alive that sense of the mystic without which we might as well be in the prehistoric cave or jungle . The people are on the side of the poets . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to rake the moon out of the pond , of the exhilarated cow that jumped over the moon , of the moon 's being made of green cheese ( albeit there is no life on it ) , of goats dancing on their hind-legs  | at full of moon , of the man in the moon , and that sumptuous dream of fairytales ? the blue moon . Popular fancy delights to play with the moon . Elves and pixies hold their revels and eisteddfods in the moonlit glades ; leprechauns roam the woods ; and Puck is loosed to play his nocturnal pranks . Human lovers take their walks in a world of moonshine . Always there is this association of glamour and witchery with moonlight ; and as long as the moon endures , the common people will believe in that elusive beauty which restores the illusions banished by day . The full glare of daylight tends to make matter-of-fact . Essential darkness inspires an elemental dread at the abysmal nothingness of it all . But in the mysterious hours between the gloaming and the murk , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is awakened that feeling of fugitive beauty and evanescent loveliness . Magic touches the earth , revealing the queerness of houses and the strangeness of trees . Imagination has free play with the outlines of familiar things . The whiteness of moonshine and the violet of dusk belong to the world of legends and old dreams . That may explain why travelers like to see Niagara , the Taj Mahal , and Venice , in the moonlight . We see faces in the moon . We personify it in our poems . We deify it in our religions , fragments of which survive in countless lunar superstitions . The scientist knows the moon only as an oblate spheroid ? a sort of byproduct of the earth , a globular mass that revolves with the regularity of a metronome . But literature reminds us that the moon is a big symbol , a toy left over from some primeval revelry , a lamp more magical than Aladdin 's . The sun is always a circle , but there are as many moons as there are moods in a woman . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 moon , thou climb'dt skies ! How silently and with how wan a face ! Or , Art thou pale with weariness Of climbing heaven , and gazing on the Wandering companionless ? But that is a rare mood . Sometimes is weird ; sometimes she is pensive ; she is gay ; many times she is d with witchery. a We found a poem the other which represents the sauciness of moon : ? Have you heard what the young moon said to As I walk 'd in the morning early ? Shall we make a match of it , you and me ? ' Oh ! a saucy slip of a wench was she . She lay on her back and laugh 'd at me As I walk 'd in the morning early . There may be a.grammatical mist in the third line ; there may be an a ; t nomical error in the first and fi but there is a distinct emotion .. is original and true , and the poet lucky enough to catch it . There are hundreds of moons . varying phase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . certainly as the emotions of child are revived by some cl-ante odor drifting perfume , so are the moods youth , with its wondrous summer e. nings and winter nights , recalled by &; glimpse of the moon . Lest the notion may seem somewhat too fantastic , vR offer a few suggestions at random . Take the case of color , for example . It is common enough to hear of a yellow moon . The line of a coon-song . ? Do n't you see the great big yaller moon ? ? conjures up a picture of a ' plantation. with the nigger-gals ' sitting in a long black row ; but if we get the fundamental sentiment of coon-songs , it is somehow associated with that yaller ' moon . Try the experiment of blotting out the moon , or of substituting daylight , and the whole feeling is changed . A  | But a careful artist is not satisfied with a yellow moon . Hardy talks of a chrome-yellow ' moon , which is better , because the more distinctive color gives a more exact emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hugh Walpole speaks of an apricottinted moon , ' and yet again of the pale primrose of a crescent moon . ' That expression , if we mistake not , does more than paint a picture in a single stroke : it paints an emotion with brilliance and vividness . Compton Mackenzie has described an ivory moon shimmering in the blue dusk . ' His descriptions of the sunsetcolors , the topaz eves of May , ' the silver nights of June , ' bring back by a subtle spell the very feelings of youth spent in London . Young Michael Fane went to Oxford , and his chief recollection of the city of dreaming spires was of the silver moonlight flooding the silent streets of night . The whole meaning of Oxford lies imprisoned in that memory . The love-story of Guy Hazlewood began with a sub-lunar adventure on a September evening , when he saw the moon of dislustred gold that grew more and more burnished as it mounted above the hills . Oscar Wilde , another precisian in matters of color , describes a ' honeycolored moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Dorian Gray , steeped in a life of infamy and crime , saw the moon that grinned at him like a skull . That horrible fancy seems to lay bare the secret of his soul . In describing the island of the LotosEaters , Tennyson says : ? Full-faced above the valley stood the moon . We all know that moon ? pale in the afternoon light . In the magic of twilight , as children , we howled for the moon ; the Lotos-Eaters saw it as a ghost of a dead world , a thing not worth crying for . Nothing was worth desiring . VOL. 129-NO. 3 The entrancing illusions that make life worth striving for had been explained away . Everything was vanity , futility , disillusion ; and that faded moon gives exactly the touch required . But how different from the moons of infancy , of childhood and of youth ! Mr. G. K. Chesterton describes a nightmare in which a man stepped into the open air and walked alone through the empty streets of London , which were blank with white moonshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight on some alien planet . ' Another feeling ? an uncanny one this time ? which comes from the moon . Contrast this with the feeling in A Midsummer Night 's Dream , where Titania commands her fairy attendants to Pluck the wings of painted butterflies , And fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes . There is nothing uncanny here , . but all the beneficent enchantment of fairyland . In his Island Nights ' Entertainments , Stevenson describes a murder done in a tropical forest in the green moonlight . Those huge and hideous dolls , which Case employed to terrify the natives , had been blown up by gunpowder , and lay blazing in the weird light . The scene is bizarre enough as a setting for the murder , and , the green moonlight added the last freakish touches that saved the story from becoming merely a boys ' Blood . ' The mention of Stevenson reminds one of his poem on the moon ; but it is too well known for quotation . As a final illustration , we might refer to Sir William Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of common things He mirrored as the moon in Rydal Mere Is mirrored , when the breathless night hangs blue ; Strangely remote she seems , and wondrous near , And by some nameless difference born anew . There seems to be the essence of Wordsworth in that picture ; yet how differ-L  | ent from the moon of Stevenson 's verse ! One might go on indefinitely . One thinks of the crescent moon on Turkish mosques and minarets , and the vision somehow conjures up the very soul of Mohammedanism . Or of the Arabs on the desert as the sun sinks and a thin sickle gleams in the west ? a scimitar suspended in heaven as a symbol of the faith which has been kept , and a sign that the fast of Ramadan is ended . ( Glory be to Allah ! ) The round moon dreams over Persian rose-gardens , where Omar wandered with his sweet companion ? the moon of his delight that knew no wane . It floats in the purple twilight of Spain . It shines , brilliant and white , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern sea . It stares over Arctic snows , and glows golden over warm South Seas . The watchdog barks at the moon in Hans Andersen 's tale . Another watchdog bays by the Tiber while Lord Byron muses in the Coliseum at midnight . We see the moon as a silver gondola , or as a bow new-bent in heaven . ' It bathes in blue lakes with golden shores , among the clouds of early spring ; it covers the roads of summer nights like new-fallen snow ; the broad face of the harvest moon gazes sadly over the fields of standing sheaves ; the last strip of the withered moon makes the winter mornings weird and wizard-like . It stirs innumerable emotions , from the eerie to the lovelorn , from chastity to voluptuousness ? all , except , perhaps , courage . Then , too , if we may venture a step further , there is a distinct moonlight element in art . We do not mean the direct treatment of the subject , as in Beethoven 's Moonlight Sonata , ' or Byron Cooper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but rather that sense of lyric enchantment which reminds us of the tantalizing and naiadlike beauty of moonshine . It is not found in Russian literature . There must be a moon in Russia , but there is no , hint of moon-loveliness in the stories the people ? only of gray dawns . cold daylight , and sombre nightfalls . There is always a feeling as of an iron bell tolling through a Russian story . But France is full of love and laughter , and the haunting beauty of things seen it moonlight . Maupassant ' ' s short story . Clair de Lune , is probably one of the world 's masterpieces , and it deals specifically with moonshine . But there is moonshine in most of Maupassant 's stories . Arnold Bennett 's tales seem to move in a strong noon light which discloses the details of things as they really are : that is why the author writes prose instead of poetry ? he sees too much ; he knows too well . The writers who aim at reality decline to be misled by illusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life unendurable . There is more moon-enchantment in Coleridge than in Wordsworth ; more in Shelley than in Byron ; more in Keats than in any of these . But best of all is Shakespeare . All his comedies are Midsummer Nights ' Dreams . We do not suggest that his heroines are elusive . They are essentially healthy animals . and Shakespeare is never so happy as when he can dress them up as boys ? Viola , Imogen , Portia , Julia , Jessica . But they have a witchery and glamour that scarcely belongs to our workaday world . By sheer power of magic , Shakespeare can create the very ache of first love . He weaves a spell of sensuous delight . He leads his dukes into forests and wrecks them on enchanted islands , and even in court they talk about the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets . Rich perfumes snare the senses ; wandering strains of music ravish the ears ; it seems as natural to make love as to breathe or sing . Miranda sits  | within her cave making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding to the vows of Romeo ; musicians are serenading Silvia ; Demetrius and Hermia , Lysander and Helena sleep in the woods ; Jessica and Lorenzo sit on a moonlit bank while the sounds of music creep into their ears ; Fenton elopes with Anne Page while fairies dance round Falstaff ; Rosalind and Celia have fled to the forest of Arden . But where is Mrs. Grundy ? Where are the complications of modern life ? the financial problems , the social difficulties , the moral restrictions , the limitations imposed by civilization , etiquette , religion ? The Shakespearean comedy is gay with elemental emotions and pagan merriment . It is the world of Puck , and Pan , and Dan Cupid ; of Phyllis , Corydon , Amaryllis , Philomel ? and MOONSHINE ! @#
