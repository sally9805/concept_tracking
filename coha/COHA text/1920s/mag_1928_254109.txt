When Thomas Cochran , Morgan partner , sailed for Europe two years ago , he was reported to have said General Motors stock was worth $200 a share ( TIME , Aug. 16 , 1926 ) . General Motors went above $210 . <P> When John J. Raskob , chairman of General Motors ' finance committee , sailed for Europe two months ago , he said General Motors was worth $225 a share ( TIME , April 2 ) . It went to $210 on May 7 . <P> But when William Crapo Durant , stock market operator and motor manufacturer , sailed for Europe seven weeks ago , he said nothing striking .

With the banks continuously increasing their deposits , it is natural that these surplus funds will be placed in outside channels seeking good investment . " I do not share the opinion that the present movement of the stock market is due to any one man or group of individuals but is due to world-wide prosperity . . . . In Paris , London and Berlin good securities have had terrific advances . The world 's capital is seeking profitable investment . <P> " Brokers ' loans of $5,000,000,000 do n't mean anything . In fact , I do n't believe $10,000,000,000* would make much difference . Bank deposits and resources have increased enormously and these funds must be put to work one way or another . The stock market affords a good outlet . " <P> <P> *There is only about $5,000,000,000 actual cash in the entire U. S.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
