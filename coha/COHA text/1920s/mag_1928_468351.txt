HE WAS a Professor of Pretentious Noise , and he was taking his ease at the University Club . This almost Georgian fortress is a sanctuary for jaded pedagogues . When twilight comes up across the campus from the lake you will see them emerging from their offices , stoop-shouldered , astigmatic , a little depressed , and making their way among the elms toward the Club 's cushions and hooded lights . There is enough of cerebration in the day 's job . These tired men make their living by keeping the gears of the mind always overheated . Therefore , when they seek repose they will not demand intellectual fare . You will find no books at the University Club , and few of the journals in the reading room are profound . All this the Professor of Pretentious Noise took for granted . He was there for comfort , and , in the dusk , he would take a little quiet pleasure , reading . So he picked up a magazine . When I came upon him , the veins on his forehead were swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journal he had happened upon was that contumacious New Republic , and he wondered what wretch had got its name on the budget . He banged his fist . Look here , the sheet spoke slurringly of the Vice-President ! Mr. Dawes lived not more than half a mile from the Club , and the Professor had shaken his hand , some years before , when Mr. Dawes organized the Minute Men of America . He was for deporting these damned I. W. W. editors to Leningrad , where they belonged , whence they were paid . He would see that whoeverwas responsible for the presence here of this vileness lost his job or his membership . He tossed the New Republic away and picked up another journal . I asked if he knew this one at all . No , he said , but he had heard his uncle , years ago , speak highly of the Nation . I waited happily . In a moment there was a great roar , such a bellow as Professors usually reserve for colleagues who flunk fullbacks . I followed after when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own ears I heard his ultimatum . Either the Club would immediately cancel its subscriptions to these two subversive and inflammatory weeklies , or ? or by God ! the Professor of Pretentious Noise would resign from the Club and then bring suit against it . Always , of course , there was Prexy . One day he telephoned to a colleague of mine in the English Department . Parents , he said , were complaining about the work that two of my colleague 's students were doing . It was , he understood , alarmingly suggestive , and , if the reports were true , even erotic . Would my colleague investigate ? Would he , if the charge proved true , move to suppress these activities ? My colleague asked the names of the two rakish youths . Just a moment ? Prexy had made a note of them . Ah , yes , here they were . Would my colleague kindly see if something could not be done to make more seemly the undergraduate essays of ?

I thought of the presses at Yale , Harvard , Columbia , Chicago . One was , 1 thought , little less than obligatory on the Greater Atlantis , which was to do so much for Scholarship , the State , the Community , and the mail-order houses . He looked at me patiently , understanding that I had the scholar 's impracticality . No , he said , no university press ever made money . There would be none at Atlantis . . .. And once he called me in for rebuke . The President of the University of Utah had been offended by remarks of mine about his institution that had been published in a magazine . Displaying the provincialism I had commented on , the President of the University of Utah ( and the head of his history department , too ) had written , not to me but to Prexy , suggesting that I ought to be disciplined , suppressed , and ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was only bored by the protest of his peer , but the situation wasdelicate . Was what I had said true ? he asked . I suggested that perhaps I should not have said it if I had not believed so . If it was n't true , then it was libel , I informed him , and he might write his petitioners to sue me for damages . Ah , yes . Prexy thought and studied and looked at me . Sometimes , he said , sometimes there had been trouble ? members of the faculty who had published articles , reports , and other material that , later on , proved to have been , well , not precisely their own work . Could I ? that is , did I care to assure him that ? that what I had written had been entirely my own ? Not forgetting the Professor , who was also a Dean . He dealt with stirring and vital truths , and he was of the department that more than any other might lead our national thinking into better ways , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1850 , when that subject was sheer romance . He would interrupt his lecture on matters of greater import , I think , thanany others we pedagogues deal with and , fixing a stern eye on a man in the front row who was a candidate for honors in his field , would announce , " Mr. Smith , I did not see you at Epworth League last night . " He was Professor Blank , but mostly he was Dean Blank . One dared not call him Blank or Mr. Blank . One day a library assistant approached him , a girl who was earning her tuition working at the delivery desk . " I have the book you wanted , Mr. Blank , " she said , for she was young and unpracticed and knew not the management of the Levites . Without a word to her he marched into the Librarian 's office and demanded that the girl be fired . " A woman with no greater sense of academic rank than she has , " he said , " is absolutely unfit to be employed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universities has been the history of civilization . Moreover , the teacher is the elder wise man of the race , nor has his caste ever been widely separated from that of the priest . Always , in any age , pedagogy is a vital , adventurous profession . Always , too , at any moment , it is torn within by discord and self-distrust and the turmoil of the new age that is perpetually coming to be . Reading in the public prints to-day the dirges and paeans of those who are considering the state of the colleges , one is amused to find a prevalent belief that the present turmoil is something new and that the colleges face a crisis which is likely to destroy them . A certain ignorance characterizes those experts in education who make most outcry . Abelard , I remember , complained bitterly that the colleges of his day were overcrowded , and Erasmus after him . Have we forgotten Herbert Spencer 's declaration ? it might well have been Mr. Dewey 's that the colleges must adapt themselves to the new age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out entirely the whole complex of education , the colleges , the curricula , the faculties , the student bodies : and no one remembers that a diversion of Edward Gibbon 's was the writing of autobiography . Nor do I find anywhere among the current Hoseas and Jeremiahs any awareness that they are echoing Henry Adams or Matthew Arnold or Cardinal Newman , or Plato , Zeno , or Epictetus . A bilious onlooker might suggest that one cause of the crisis may be the scarcity of educated men among the faculties . Nevertheless , it is true that the profession was never in a greater chaos than to-day 's and that the problems confronting the colleges were never more difficult . Novel as the idea may be to the editorial writers , no one is quite so keenly aware of these facts as the colleges themselves . Panic , indeed , has settled on them . A great many of them actually confess failure by pausing in the year 1928 to inquire just what their function is . Atlantis , which I have just quitted , was feverish throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dean of Liberal Arts , or the Department of Personnel , or the Department of Education , or the President himself launched on the faculty a questionnaire asking every teacher to state his conception of the proper aims of the college . It was a great bore , but lightened occasionally by some of the replies . All but a few of them were trite , most of them were dull , and some were asinine . One man , I remember , victimized by the necromancy of alliteration as the writers of advertisements are , summed up the aims of education as Fun , Friendship , Facts , and Faith . There was a great but secret laughter among the juniors of his department , one of whom remarked , with a conception of education that goes back to the Greeks , that a truer statement of them would be Doubt , Disillusionment , and Despair . I do not quarrel with that last definition . Another colleague answered the last questionnaire to this effect : to improve the quality of instruction at Atlantis , which should be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weed out the fools from among us , get better teachers , and try to see that the students who face us are of a higher type . His was the only realistic moment in the whole incident . If the colleges have reached a situation in which they do not know what education is , if they do not see clearly what their purposes are , if they do not know unequivocally what they should be doing and how they should be doing it , if , in short , they do not understand the present age and their function in it , then indeed they are bankrupt and damned . Here a digression seems called for . It is a little odd that one must explicitly declare that college professors are , for the most part , able , intelligent , and efficient men . Yet the contrary opinion is so widely held that my solemn declaration must seem iconoclastic to many people . So accepted is the belief in professorial incompetence that the very freshmen who come to be taught that sentences are preferably began with capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their instructors are nincompoops and regard them with a contempt it is hardly worth while to disguise . Outside the campuses , the world at large thinks of professors as halfwits . If they are capable of anything , why are they content with five thousand dollar jobs ? ? so runs the question held to be unanswerable . The fallacy usually takes this form : " Those who can , do : those who ca n't , teach . " Mr. Meneken has printed ten thousand variations of the theme , and that group of extraordinarily dull young thinkers whose only distinction is that they have repudiated Mr. Mcneken parrot this particular idea of his with unanimous approval . The idea , of course , is utterly absurd . If pedagogy had not taught me to avoid generalizations I should be disposed to stand on the exact converse . In eontemporary America it is generally true that those who ca n't , do , and those who can , teach . Except for the arts , I can think of no intelligent calling whose most distinguished practitioners are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible for all that is admirable in the recent progress of law , medicine , surgery , public hygiene , physics , chemistry , biology , and a dozen other activities of the mind . The half-sciences are wholly professorial , so that you will hardly find all told a half-dozen reputable philologists , anthropologists , psychologists , archeologists , sociologists , or economists outside the campus gates . Are not the new colleges of journalism admittedly the happiest omen in to-day 's press ? As editors and critics are Professors Canby , Kruteh , Van Doren , and the late Stuart Sherman noticeably inferior to their unacademic colleagues ? Could you refute a man who thought Professors Pound and Frankfurter better lawyers than this great name or that one ? Perhaps you are moved to recite the greatness , in our day , of the scientific and scholarly foundations created by rich men , or the research laboratories maintained by industrial corporations , or the more admirable bureaus of the national government . These , indeed , seem a refutation of my statement ? till one reflects that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade of pedagogy ( it is pleasanter , I think , than most others on earth ? and that fact answers the unanswerable question ) is made up of highly skilled men who arc highly competent at their business . Its mean efficiency is higher than that of any other profession . Why , then , if this is so , are the colleges now confessedly ineffective ? Well it was to answer this question that I introduced my digression . In any other profession the incompetent and the brainless settle to the bottom , where they are impotent : and impostors , conjurors , and charlatans are soon placarded as such so that their colleagues may deal with them . But inpedagogy they do not fare that way . They become Professors of Education . Then , in due time , because members of their brotherhood are in control , they become chairmen of the committees that control the college , and then they become Deans , and then they become Presidents . Let me at once admit that some Professors of Education are both able and aware that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there you will find one who is actually doing valuable work . I have known a few : I have even known one Dean who was a Professor of Education but who , nevertheless , when the time came , stood firmly on the side of the angels . I hear that he has recently won his battle and has delivered Atlantis from the most serious menace to academic freedom it has had to face . Yes , unquestionably some of the species are good men , but though you may sometimes find good men in stews and hop joints , still you must hold to your judgment of people who frequent such places . And toward the generality of Educators one must urge the teaching of the church toward heretics . They may be charming fellows , now and then , but they are accursed of God and damned , and they shall be run to earth and slain for the glory of God , the salvation of their souls , and the security of the faith . As a veteran of the colleges , and one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of the present plight of the colleges is due to this group of uneducated fanatics , crazed enthusiasts , or wilful charlatans who have , in the last fifteen years , ridden into power . It is they who have debauched the curricula , violated the chastity of pedagogy , ravished the academic quiet of sane men , and created the noise and stink and smoke-screen that envelop the profession . Borrowing everything that is illegitimate in several sciences , incorporating with it half a dozen major sophistries , and begetting upon themselves a thing called " methodology " and other monsters , they have created what is known as the Science of Education . There is , their hallucinations have it , a Science of Teaching , a Science of Managing and Governing Universities , and a Science of Classifying , Guiding , and Prophesying about the Young . The sum of these is the Science of Education . Inscribing the slogans of this idiotic Science upon their guidons , the Educators have besieged the Trustees of the colleges and the public . Now a Trustee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to shape its destiny and disburse its funds and dictate its policies , for the sufficient reason that he delivered four counties to the Governor intact or that he has money enough to make him a prospective donor of a dormitory or a gymnasium . Or the sufficient reason may be , merely , that he hopes to be Bishop of New York . He is frequently not a college man , seldom an educated man , and never a teacher . He is almost always a business man with a superstitious awe of education ? a willing , tolerant person who wants to do justly in his position but has learned to demand things which he calls Facts and Results . Upon him the Educators descend , mouthing their hideous jargon , chanting litanies whose terms are pseudoscientific neologisms of no meaning whatever . There is a magic in words , especially for the uneducated . These quack scientists with their charts , graphs , tests , questionnaires , reports , surveys , analyses , and all the other trappings of their trade ? accessories as gaudy and pinchbeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sorcery . There is , of course , nothing of science about them , but they have convinced the amiable , ignorant Trustees that there is . They have taken the element of chance out of education , they say , so that hereafter there will be nothing unpredictable about it , nothing mysterious , nothing immaterial or vague or unstatable in terms of Facts and Results . So they have captured the Trustees , and , because no advertisement that promises " You ca n't lose " or " Cure guaranteed " ever fails of its intended effect , they have taken in the public as well . The public , on their assurances , believes that the laborious and mysterious process of education is to be made , by the Educators , as simple and effortless as a consultation with a palmist . Now they are in the saddle . They control the colleges , doing with them what their aberrant instincts lead them to do . Oh , they are not yet quite secure , nor are they unmolested in their madness But for the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties under with questionnaires . They harass them with reports and analyses . They demand increasing portions of their time for the collection of data out of which spells and incantations are to be made . They lecture them about the technic of instruction and come more and more to enforce their demands for it . They select the material for education , they dictate the processes , and they control the support . The worst omen of their power is the way in which they are made Deans and Presidents all over the Republic . Formerly , when you had to appoint a Dean or a President , you chose a man who was a great teacher or was otherwise remarkable for intellectual attainments . A few of those who belong to the great tradition are left us ; but as they die or retire their places are everywhere filled by men whose only qualification is one that should forever disqualify them , that they are experts in the Science of Education . What will happen when all of the great tradition are gone from us and Professors of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiropractors dictators of public-health control , or appointed Justices of the Supreme Court exclusively from among astrologers ? III The Great Educator was addressing us . " Gentlemen , " he said , " the students are our customers , and we must give them what they want . " He voiced the " credo in unum Deum Pairem " of the Educators ' faith . That way , irretrievably , goes the course of American education . I doubt that , save for five or six Eastern institutions ( which are exempt , let it be understood , from everything I say ) , any college in the country would oppose it , if it were stated in terms of vocational guidance . One ponders . The customer of the surgeon might want his lower intestine removed in the hope of realizing Metchnikoff 's dream . The customer of the lawyer might want to experiment with his private interpretation of a blue sky law . The customer of the priest might demand his approval of a little private murder for the faith 's sake . The Educators have slain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve those immaterial values known as the humanities . Therefore , the Educators war upon the English department . This second Educator was no departure from the type . " What you gentlemen of the English department must realize , " he informed the score or more of us who were gathered to hear him , " is that you are not scientific . You have not rigidly standardized your methods . You do not explicitly state your aims . You have no formula by which to achieve them . How can you expect , then , to achieve them ? I venture to assert that there is not here to-night one of you who can tell what the norm of his subject is . And if there were one stated norm here , I know very well that it would differ widely from that which another of you might work out . " The Educator denounced us with his eyes and , I swear it on my sword , he then said , " What , for instance , would you say was your norm for the appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gathered to hear still another Great Educator . This one , Like so many others , had about him that air of fanaticzeal I have often seen in the prophets who come down from the greasewood slopes of my native state , crying the wrath to come . His eyes were fiery , and he was not in the least of this world but was altogether dedicate to the mad voodoos of his faith . He began to tell us about the psychological tests . Of these tests , pedagogy at large believes that they are harmless , the psychologists that they are an occasional means of grace , and the Educators that they are the Word , the Way , and the Light . This Educator , like all his tribe , was convinced that they were the ultimate key to the problem of making pedagogy an exact science . He began to tell us of the success that one kind of test , the general intelligence test given to all Freshmen , had achieved at Atlantis . Graph after graph passed under his fingers till the floor about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the enormous energy expended on this survey and the costly machinery created to perform it . The labor of many men and enough money to maintain a research professorship in the study of diabetes had gone into this single incantation . Gradually the point emerged if one had skill enough , as we philologists had , to understand the barbarous terminology . The point was this : a magnificent vindication of this test had been accomplished . His department had analyzed the results of that test and had compared them with the grades which the Freshmen had later achieved in college courses . The coefficient of correlation , he said in an awed voice , was 5.4 ! On the basis of this test , his department could have predicted , to the power of that coefficient , what any given student would do in his classes ? that is , whether he would fail or pass the requirements of the college . The Educator 's eyes were those of one who had seen God . I reflected . 5.4 ! I questioned him . What was the unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlation have been ? Was 5.4 based on a scale of 6 ? Why no , he informed me , naturally not . It was on a scale of 10 . In other words , the test which was given at such an expense of time , energy , and money , achieved exactly the same result , the same coefficient of correlation , that anyone could achieve with no effort and in one-tenth of a second by tossing a coin . The test occupied three hours . I think that any teacher worth his salt may confidently engage , if he be allowed to talk to a Freshman for one hour , to achieve a coefficient of correlation , bearing on that Freshman 's success in his course , of something like 8.5 . Or let him teach that student for three one-hour periods , the time expended on the test , and he will achieve a coefficient of correlation not lower than 9.965 . But that , of course , is what the Educators call the Personal Equation in Teaching . And , it developed as the Educator passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ideal , the Personal Equation must be rooted out of teaching . It was , he said , the supreme obstacle to the progress of Educators . For behold , there was now no way of predicting what a given student , A , would do under a given Professor , B. Professor C 's methods differed violently from those of Professor D. Not only were the methods of teaching one subject absolutely non-interchangeable with those of another , which was a villainy dreadful enough , but even , incredible as it might sound , one man 's ways of teaching a given subject were absolutely non-interchangeable with those of another man who was teaching the same subject . Here the Educator was aghast . This intolerable situation wrenched him with rack and pinion , but , incredibly , there was worse to be noted . Not only was there no standardized method of teaching a given subject , but there was not even a standardized body of material to be taught . Jones , teaching English B19 , stressed facts that Smith , teaching thesame course , ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preached doctrines that Green denied . In economics , sociology , philosophy , fine arts , and even the sciences ( except Education ) there was dissent , contradiction , and dispute . And until this incredible folly should be remedied there would indeed he no progress in education but only the blind and fumbling wastage of to-day . We must , he said , codify , fix , and standardize our corpus of knowledge . We must see that everywhere teachers of the same subject taught the same thing . But , what was far more important , we must see that they taught it in the same way . Fixed , standardized , and scientific methods ? ? that was the hope of the world . We could not , otherwise , be fair to the student . We could not , otherwise , honestly accept his trade . We could not , otherwise , guarantee him the accomplishment of his desires . There was , also , this still more important angle : till methods were everywhere standardized the Educators could not perfect their psychological tests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till those tests should he perfected . Here the Educator confided to us some of his expectations . Some day , when material and methods were standardized , he would relieve us of the Examination Problem : that is , of all bother about grades and quizzes and ranking . Some day lie would be able to give an entering freshman a psychological test that would consume no more than three hours . At the end of it he would be able to predict with absolute certainty not only what grade that freshman would receive in any course under any instructor in the university ( provided standardization had been established ) , but also what his exact ratio of success would be in any branch of human endeavor he might desire to follow . That , we must understand , was the millennium , and when it came all the devils that annoy education would be chained forevermore . But to attain it we must first rigidly codify our material , eliminate all that was equivocal in it , wholly stand-ardiz ' e our methods , and weed out from ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was an Educator and , therefore , innocent of the world . He did not know that the kind of education he had set up as his ideal was already available . It was , of course , and any practical man could have explained it more eloquently than he . He could have bought it at any store that dealt in phonograph records , and all his millennium needed further was a constitutional amendment creating a bureau of acoustic standards and making it against God to lecture from a platform . I have dealt with this Educator at length because his madness is characteristic and his fate significant . Let us suppose that , somewhere in the prairies , a new prophet one day appears . He is clad only in a breechclout , and his food is locusts and his drink water . He begins to preach a new religion . He preaches , say , the elder deity Anubis returned to earth and ready for the coming of his kingdom . Anubis , the god 's new prophet says , has ordained a penance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefingers of their left hands , must sell their goods and give all to the priests , and must take only one meal in forty-eight hours and that raw . He makes converts ? for no religion that has yet appeared in America has failed to do so . Thereupon , emboldened , the prophet makes public the meat of Anubis 's worship , having heretofore revealed only the milk . Armbis , it appears , is a jealous god and has commanded the spoliation of unbelievers . They who are faithful shall sacrifice only their firstborn , cutting their throats at the altar of Anubis , but they who have not acknowledged him shall at once perish by the sword , they and all their offspring and their menservants and maidservants and all the in- crease oftheir kine . Moreover , the prophet announces , the earth is flat and a comet will destroy it at 9:28 P.m. a week from next Thursday , and he who eats white bread is an abomination unto Anubis . . . . What do we do with the prophet ? Do we not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad and shut him up in the booby-hatch ? I think we do . But the Great Educator whose madness I have described was not shut up in the booby-hatch . Instead , his delusions were noised abroad outside Atlantis , and presently came Trustees bearing incense and sandalwood , and he departed from among us . He was made a college President . And that is what is wrong with the colleges . Good humor must be preserved . 1 do not think that the present crisis will yield to any theoretical , idealistic , or practical solution , whether conceived by Professors of Education , by their saner opponents , or by a race of hardheaded , fact-loving pedagogues who may some day arise . The function of the colleges is too completely organic with the interests of the commonwealth to permit much conscious guidance of their development . The complexity of the social organism creates an impersonal determinism that controls the colleges . I think , however , that the current pressure will be eased and the current griefs assuaged by the further course of an evolution that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition that already exists and are content to abide by it their problems will be enormously simplified . The condition I refer to is the grouping of the colleges in what may be either a guild system or a caste system . Such a grouping is already much more than embryonic : the recognition of it proceeds apace . All that is required is a frank acceptance of it by those that now ignore or deny it . Already a number of colleges have abandoned their efforts to be all things to all students Increasingly , I think , economic necessity and the sheer power of numbers will force more of them to do so . It is perhaps true that the desire to participate in fraternity affairs for the purpose of preparing oneself for a political career is as legitimate a motive for going to college as the more ascetic desire for intellectual discipline . But certain colleges ? call such a one Avalon ? have already announced their intention to limit their students to those who are governed by the latter hope . They say , in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want student activities go to Valhalla . Similarly , other colleges ( it may be , reluctantly ) , have forever abandoned hope of being national athletic champions . These say to prospective registrants , if your ideal of college life is basking vicariously in the sun of great halfbacks , go to ? ( insert the name of the university that has never joined the Big Ten , or , in the East the one that has ? but there , there ! ) , but if you are content with other values we will consider you . Such choices as these , and there is more evidence of them than I have hinted at , seem to me to indicate that a selective process is at work . In the day when that selective process has fulfilled itself there will be various groups of colleges . The group of which Valhalla is representative will devote its energies to the support of such democracy and salesmanship as are now mainly identified with the State universities of the Middle West . Another group , with Avalon for type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and intellectual integrity . Another group will soberly prepare its students for the professional schools , another will preserve the country club college to teach the children of the newly rich the amenities of their station , a third will produce vibrant Christian manhood , and a fourth will provide asylum for the Professors of Education . As affairs now stand , the average college is wasting its energy and substance trying to be all these colleges in one , but in the great day that I foresee it will choose one type , or have that type forced upon it by natural selection , and give up yearning after the rest . In that day Avalon will send out no alumni scouts when the football team has been beaten and will hear without a pang of self-reproach the tale of Utopia 's new stadium , Valhalla 's glee clubs , and courses in radio-announcing , and the vast registration in the department of menu-reading at Yvetot . It will inform those who lust after the specialties of other groups that its endowment in them is but feeble , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose interest in them is professional would be wise to register elsewhere . And in that day , too , Valhalla and Yvetot shall be one voice repudiating any more than an amateur curiosity about the intellect . And parents of prospective freshmen may govern themselves accordingly . Here , however , I touch upon romance and prophecy , which are wholly the province of the Educators . I seriously believe that some such evolution will take place , and is even well begun . Pending its fruition , however , if I am reproached for offering destructive criticism only , and if anyone demands that I forthwith clear up the present crisis , I have a reply at hand . It is a purely impersonal solution for I am no longer a pedagogue and will neither suffer nor profit by its adoption , I have already written it down herein , quoting a colleague of mine who in his time has done some noble larruping of pedagogical quacks . I repeat it : to improve the colleges , get rid of the fools who roam among them . Begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
