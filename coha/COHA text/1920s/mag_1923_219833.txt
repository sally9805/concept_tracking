In " the good old days " of the Bible Baptists , members of this denomination held that only persons baptized by immersion were Christians , because immersion was the New Testament mode of baptism . The Southern Baptists still hold to this belief , and refuse to cooperate with any other Protestant denominations in the Federal Council of Churches . The Northern Baptists cooperate , but have a communion service which is closed to all Christians except those who have been immersed . Dr. Cornelius Woelfkin , of the Park Avenue Baptist Church , New York , has declared for the " open church " -i . e. , receiving members from other communions without immersion . Along with this " heresy , " Dr. Woelfkin declares that he believes in evolution , and thinks that the church should try to elevate the theatre , not obliterate it . He is assailed by conservatives like Drs . John Roach Stratton and J. Frank Norris , as subverting Baptist faith and morals . The controversy assumes importance because the annual Northern Baptist Convention will be held at Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " question disturbed last year 's convention at Indianapolis . Dr. Woelfkin is in no danger of a heresy trial , because each Baptist church governs itself , and Dr. Woelfkin 's church is largely in his favor .
