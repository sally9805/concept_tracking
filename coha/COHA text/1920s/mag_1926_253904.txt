Last week more primaries were held . In Wisconsin two important Republican senatorial candidates were Governor John J. Elaine ( Wet ) supported by Senator Robert M. ( " Sonny " ) LaFollette , and Senator Irvine L. Lenroot ( Dry ) , enthusiastic Coolidge man , although he was elected six years ago on an " insurgent " platform . The extremely bitter fight was won by Governor Elaine , with some 15,000 plurality . <P> The gubernatorial battle was , if anything , more important than that for senator , because it involved the state machine control shakily assumed by young Senator LaFollette after his famed father 's death . The candidate of the LaFollette group was Herman L. Ekern , who was opposed by Fred R. Zimmerman , onetime friend of the elder LaFollette , but hostile to the scion . Mr. Zimmerman won by over 50,000 plurality . <P> In New Hampshire Senator George H. Moses , antiworld court and president pro tempore of the Senate , was renominated in the Republican primary by a two-to-one vote over onetime ( 1911-13 ) Governor Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Moses , 33,900 ; Mr. Bass , 16,200 . Robert C. Murchie , Concord attorney , was nominated by the Democrats . <P> In Nevada Senator Tasker L. Oddie , ( pro-world Court ) won the slackly balloted Republican senatorial nomination over E. E. Roberts , Mayor of Reno . The score : Mr. Oddie , 7,716 ; Mr. Roberts , 3,665 . <P> The Democratic primary was handled neatly by onetime Director of the Mint Raymond T. Baker ( see below ) . The score : Mr. Baker , 4,363 ; P. A. McGarren , 2,524 . <P> Arizona voters are pleased with warhorses . Governor George W. P. Hunt , five times Governor , last week was renominated for a sixth term in the Democratic primary , will oppose E. S. Clark , Republican nominee . <P> War-horse Carl T. Hayden , long ( 1912-25 ) Arizona 's lone Congressman , received the Democratic senatorial nomination . He will oppose Senator Ralph H. Cameron , unopposed last week in the Republican primary . <P> In Massachusetts Senator William M. Butler , Chairman of the Republican National Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. Walsh in the autumn , who likewise was unopposed in the Democratic primary . <P> Georgia Democratic voters renominated Senator Walter Franklin George , able successor to " Tom " Watson , and rejected Congressman William David Upshaw for a fourth congressional term ( see p. 7 ) . <P> Vermont voters nominated Senator Porter H. Dale without opposition due to the withdrawal of onetime ( 1900-02 ) Governor William Wallace Stickney ( TIME , July 19 ) . <P> Last week regular Republicans could no longer hope to control the Senate . It is barely possible that the next Senate will show a Democratic majority . But almost certainly the regular Republicans plus the insurgent Republicans will be a majority , thus giving to the latter the balance of power .
