President Albert Russel Erskine of the Studebaker ( motor cars ) Corp . has a thriving $135,878,000 industry at South Bend , Ind . At Buffalo , N. Y. , 450 miles away , President Myron E. Forbes of the Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Co. also has a not so thriving industry , with assets of $24,373,000 . These facts , plus the reasonable inference that Studebaker might specialize on one grade of car and Pierce-Arrow on another , plus the further fact that President Erskine last week admitted he has been having informal conversations with President Forbes on the subject , indicated that a Studebaker-Pierce-Arrow merger was possible . But nothing definite has happened in that specific regard . <P> President Forbes and President Edward S. Jordan of the Jordan.Motor Car Co. at Cleveland , also have considered a joining of their companies . But that has been too nebulous so far for anything but denials . <P> The Nash Motors Co. at Kenosha , Wis. , also has been in merger discussions . But doughty President Charles W. Nash has been " sitting tight , " saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind locked gates and doors his engineers are redesigning the Nash motor and body to improve speed and chic of present models .
