txt Colonel William Mitchell resuming today his offensive before the army court-martial to justify his charges against the national aviation services , called five officers of the Army Air Service to the stand , all of whom swore that one Air Service as now organized was largely equipped with obsolete airplanes , for the most part relics of the World War . With a single exception , all of the officers are attached to the Air Service headquarters in Washington , while the fifth , now of the reserve , was a squadron commander in the World War . These officers were Major H. H. Arnold , one of Wilbur Wright 's pupils and a pioneer of the American service ; Captain Robert Oldys , Colonel W. E. Gilmore , Chief of the Air Supply Division , and Major T. F. Miller , whose service in the air bas passed the 1,000-hour mark and to whom has been assigned the task of organizing and directing the training of the National Guard and National Reserve air units . Lieut . Col. W. A. Shauffler was the reserve airman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Oldys swear that Major Sheldon Harley Wheoler of the Hawaiian air group , had gone to his death as the resplt of an order which , literally interpreted , called upon the army pilots in the moment of emergency to direct their efforts first to the saving of their planes rather than their own lives . They heard another witness accuse Major Gen. Hugh A. Drum , ex Assistant Chief of Staff , of appearing before a committee of Congress and representing as accurate a report on aviation which a board of high ranking officers had previcusly denounced as misleading and inaccurate . Again they heard an officer swear that of the more than 500 American aviators who have met death in the line of duty since Jan. 1 , 1919 , all but twelve had gone to their deaths in planes inherited from the World War . Captain Oldys testified that he had in his possession a letter written in 1023 by the American Minister to Guatemala urging that " the . United States take steps to facilitate the establishment of an air mail service through Central America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a foothold near the Panama Canal . " The introduction of the entire letter in evidence wa. halted by objection of the prosecu-tion , Oldys Tells How Wheeler Died . Captain Oldys was the first witnehs . Early in the course of his examinatidn Mr. Reid of counsel for Colonel Mitchell asked him if he had known Major Harley , Wheeler . " I knew him well ; he was my squadron commander in Hawaii , " replied Captain Oldys . " Were you ' present when he was killed ? " " I was . I was atlhis side a few moments after he crashed . This was July 13 , 1921 . " " Tell us what you know about Major Wheeler 's death , " Mr. Reid asked . Before ' the witness could answer ; Colonel Moreland was on his feet with an objection . He wanted to know what Mr. Reid was seeking to prove . " I am going to prove by this witness , " replied Mr. Reid , " that oil the night before Major Wheeler met his death Colonel Chamberlain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . summoned Major Wheeler to his office and told him that the forced landings of machines must stop ; that he was going . to hold him personally responsible , and if necessary hold the pilots financially responsible , for the damages , the Planes . " ! Colonel Winship , the law officer of the court , interrupted and suggested that the objection be overruled , and ten , eral Howse , turning to Captain Oldys , told him to answer the question . " Before you answer , " said Mr. Reid , " I want to ask you if you had a talk with Major Wheeler a few minutes before he was killed ? " " Yes , sir , I did . It was about twenty minutes before het crashed , " Captain Oldys answered . " All right ; now ; tell us all you know about this case . " " The morning Major Wheeler was killed he and I had walked to the headcruarters together , " said Captain Oldys , " and after getting our flying equipment - we proceeded to Luke Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on- the night . before he had been summoned by Colonel .

T11 .. ct chief . of start , as . ilgajor Wheeler ex ; pressed it , ' bawled him ally and-tOldhir.i ? that in the future he would hold him Major Wheeler responsible if the forced landings continued . The chief all staff , he added , said he was going to take steps to make the pilots financially responsible for damage to the planes . Fail Trying to flisve His Plane . - 'Mayor Wheeler asked me to devote MY efforts to locating the trouble we Were having with our liberty motors , eXplaining that he had been unable to locate the trouble , and that after being bawled out ' he did n't see what he Could de : That was all he said , and in a few mutes he took off . His motor stopped vrYien he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke Field at the time . " , Major Wheeler 's orders before this time had been for the pilots in such emergencies to proceed straight ahead and save themselves and let the planes go . But on this occasion he tried to save his plane and in doing so fell into a spin , and , along with his mechanician , Was burned to death . He was dead when I got to him a few minutes after the plane crashed to the ground . " " Who was in command of the Hawaiian department at that ' time ? " Mr. Reid asked . " Major Gen. Summerall , " Captain Oldya answered . The crowd in the room was so silent while Captain Oldys was telling the story of Major Wheeler 's death that one could almost hear a pin drop . Every member of the court was leaning forward , taking in every word . Now . and then it seamed that the voice of the Young aviator halted . It was with deep feeling that he told of his fellow-officer 's death . Cross-questioned by General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a board of inquiry which investigated the death of Major Wheeler found that he came to his death when he attempted to turn back to Luke Field following a motor breakdown . The board , he added , exonerated Colonel Chamberlain . Next Mr. Reid took up the so-called Lassiter report on avlabion , mentioned by Colonel Mitchell in his San Antonio statements . " The Lassiter report " said Captain Oldys , " is a report of a War Department board which planned a reorganization of the Air Service . The plan contemplated a war-time as well as a peace-time organization . It was approved April 24 , 1923 , by the Secretary of War . " Declares Condition Critical . " Has the plan been carried into effect ? " Mr. Reid asked . Colonel Moreland was ready with an objection . He conceded that the report , , although the accepted official policy of the War Department , had not been fully carried into effect . At the proper time . he said . the Government would explain why it has not been carried out . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the court ruled he could continue he had Captain Oldys read parts of the report into the record . One sentence read , " Conditions are critical in the Air Service , " and another stated that " unless steps are taken to improve conditions in the Air Service it will , in effect . practically demobilize at an early date . " Still another read : " We can not Improvise an Air Service , and yet it is indispensable to be strong in the air at the outset of war . " Mr. Reid switched to the proposed organization of a foreign-owned mallcarrying flying service In Central America Tne prosecution made the point that the papers in this case were of a diplomatic nature . Mr. Add said he would pass over this phase of the situae lion , but added he would revert to it Inter . He then asked Captain Oldys ' what he knew about the so-called report . " That . " answered Captain Oldys , " was a report of a board composed of two artillery and one aviation officer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was gotten up at the instance of the War Department . " - The purpose of that inquiry , " Captain Oldys continued . " was to ascertain the ability of anti-aircraft guns to defend Hawaii against air attacks . After the seport was submitted I attended a con-3 ference in the office of General Drum , ; the Assistant Chief of Staff . Those oresnt were General Drum . General Pat- ? rick , the Chief of the Air Service : General Cole . the Chief of Artillery ; General xVilliarns , the Chief of Ordnance : another officer whom I do not now recall , end myself . " Says Inaccuracies Were Found . " Was anything said at that confer'awe , " Mr. Reid interrupted , " as to the accuracy of the report ? " " Yes . " Captain Oldys answered . " I recall that General Patrick told them he could not concur in the findings , while eleneral Williams said that one of his experts had checked the report for inaccuracies and had found them to ' re glaring . At the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no official use should be made of the report by the War Department or used in any other way , owing to the inaccuracdea General Patrick pointed out he could not agree with anything in the report " At this point Mr. Reid , after an itijection by Colonel Moreland had been ? verruled , submitted to the witness a report of a hearing before the special committee of the House of Representatives . Captain Oldys replied that General Drum had used the report %ellen testifying before that committee . Fatalbaes in Old Airplanes . Major Arnold , a West Point graduate and a World War aviator , was the next witness . New Yorkers will remember him as the crack aviator stationed at Governors Island in the early days of army aviation . He and Colonel Foulois are the only flyers left in the service who were trained by the late Wilbur Wright . At the present time Major . ernold is the officer in charge of the Information Division of the Air Service in the office of General Patrick . This is not a news dispensing organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and foreign countries is resembled . Mr. R'eld.questioned him as to aviation fatalitioe taking up the cases listed ' : ? A due to fault , construction or oboleteness or firma Major Arnold said the Air Service records show that 517 officers and men were killed tin the period of Jan. 1 , 1919 , to July 50 , this Tear . " How many met their death in modtrn planes ? " Mr. Reid inquired . " About twelve were killed in modern machina.s , that is , in machines built since toe war . " Major Arnold replied . " Admiral Strauss has said , testifyingi n regard to the Agamemnon tests , that 114 flights over that ship failed to make a hit , what of that ? " asked Mr. Reid . ? There were only eleven flights , " replied Major Arnold , " and the records show that ** were used and that miniature bombs were the types of bombs used . Two land squadrons carried out thole manoeuvres . " In the matter of flying personnel , Crest Britain and France , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Italy , he added , has not so many as the United States . " Do you mean for us to understand , " said Colonel Moreland in cross-examinaion , " that our personnel does not cornrare favorably with foreign personnels ? " " I mean to say . " replied Major Arnold , " that our service does not compare favorably with foreign services . That is more than an opinion . The statistics show that we have eight pursuit squadrons . while England has thirteen . France thirty and Italy twenty-two . My opinion is based on my fourteen years in the air service . " Reserve Force Policy Assailed . Lieut . Col. Shauffler who commanded Ninetieth Air Squadron in the St. Mihiel " rive and the Third Corps observation group in the Meuse-Argonne Battle , was next . He resigned from the army in 1920 . Mr. Reid offered in evidence a copy of a telegram which Colonel Shauffler identified as his message declining to re-entet the service . In the message ire said he would not go back " under existing conditions even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Shauffler as a reserve officer epmmands the Reserve Air Forces in the Third Corps Area , the headquarters of which isaBaltimore . Twice , he said , his forces have mobilized and on both occasions the mobilization took the form of a Defense Day parade tip Pennsylvania Avenue . The situation so far as the Reserve Air Force Is concerned could not , he declared , be worse . He knows only two of the men in his command . Major J. F. Miller , in charge of National Guard and Reserve Air units , called as the next witness , said that he had been a pilot since 1917 and that his service in the air exceeds 1,000 hours . The National Guard units which are concentrated in fifteen States , New York being one , le supplied with wartime planes , he said , it being the effort of the service to allot eight such planes to each group . He told of the training program which calls for about fifteen days each year . In the event of war Major Miller gave it as his opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for service in thirty days , GO per cent . in ninety days , while the remaining 40 per cent . could be disregarded . The last witness was Lieut . Col. Gilmore , Chief of the Supply Division of the Air Service . He said it was true that the airplanes sent to the Arctic with the expedition were not built for work in ice-clogged waters . The employment of the Army bombing machines to tow targets for anti-aircraft guns at Mitchel Field last Summer cost the service , said Colonel Gilmore. about 5100.000. which , ' he explained , did not include deterioration and overhead . " How many planes have we ? " asked sir . Reid . " On Sept. 80 the number was 1,950 , " replied Colonel Gilmore . " How many of them are war-time ma-chines ? " " About 75 per cent . The other 25 per cent- were built since the war . " " Is it not true , " inquired General Howse , " that the economy called for by the director of the budget has made it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , sir , " replied Colonel Gilmore . The Air Service , he said , had asked for appropriations to replace old with new equipment , bat that the request was not approved by the authorities . When Colonel Gilmore was excused the court adjourned until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning .
