Two FORSYTE INTERLUDES ( $.50 ) ; SWAN SONG ( $2.50 ) - John Galsworthy-Scribners . <P> Though descendants of the Forsytes " may make up fresh adventure for the morrow " ( their creator is 61 ) , the Forsyte saga is done . Done because the cycle of old Soames Forsyte 's life is complete , and his daughter Fleur , the only descendant that bred true to Forsyte pride and cynical acquisitiveness , has worried her fate to tragic anticlimax . In The White Monkey fate ( and Soames ) wrenched her from the love of her cousin Jon ; in The Silver Spoon fate ( and Soames ) taught her to snatch what she wanted ; in Swan Song again fate ( but not Soames ) brings her Jon that she might snatch him only to lose him forever . For of the Two Forsyte Interludes one has told charmingly of Jon 's new love , and the other poignantly of Soames ' meeting his old love . <P> Though Soames had adored his first wife , and forced his adoration on her as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting her out when she was " unfaithful . " By contrast , his daughter 's husband suffered bitterly over Fleur 's affair with Jon , but he bore with her infidelity . Whether the difference in the two generations is an advance in civilization or a deterioration in force of character , Mr. Galsworthy rather emphasizes the latter by Jon 's vague back-to-nature farming venture , and Michael 's disarming but nonetheless softy campaign to clean up the slums . Somehow the younger generation has n't quite the stamina of old Soames , cynical , Victorian , who puts an indelible stamp on his generation . <P> Swan Song picks up familiar threads of earlier episodes in the saga , yet such is the artistry that the final portrait is complete for one unfamiliar with the earlier volumes . Such one , unfortunate , may indeed sense that dramatic action is over and done , but there remains the thrilling finale fire , and there remains a generous supply of Galsworthy 's sound philosophy , and his engrossing though rather unsound sociology . <P> Author Galsworthy was born in 1867 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the law , but was sufficiently well off to be bored with it and travel . On a voyage between Adelaide and Cape Horn he became fast friends with Joseph Conrad , sailor . Thereupon he took to writing . Besides the volumes of the Forsyte saga , which total with the swan song 2,000 pages , he has done numerous other novels ( The Patrician , etc. ) , stories ( Five Tales , etc. ) , and powerful plays ( Strife , Justice , The Skin Game , etc . ) . Of recent years his hobby has been launching obscure writers . Trader Horn ( TIME , June 27 , 1927 ) he heralded from South Africa . Bambi ( TIME , July 23 ) he praised because it had minimized the rough tedium of a channel crossing .
