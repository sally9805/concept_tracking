txt As a result of the increased demand for locomotives and of the large amount of repair - work being offered The Baldwin Locomotive Works is increasing operations and more men are being taken on at the Eddystone plant . With the railroad corporations again in control of their lines efforts are being made to rejuvenate equipment which was allowed to run down in the last year of Government operation . The demand Sor repairs is so great and urgent that the railroad corporations are unable to handle the work in their own shops and are sending many engines to the locomotive companies for repairs and new devices to modernize them . The largest order for repair work probably is that given by the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. to the Baldwin Locomotive Works to include approximately 200 engines . In addition to the order from the Pennsylvania , Baldwin 's has repair work for St. Paul , the Atlantic Coast Line and the Long Island . No large orders for engines have been taken by Baldwin 's in the past week , but orders for one , two and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign buyers .

Fostered by the Polish Government a steamship line was established between Philadelphia and Poland last December and shipments of engines to Poland are being sent largely by this new line . The first of the ' 75 locomotives ordered by the Belgium Government will be completed in a few days .
