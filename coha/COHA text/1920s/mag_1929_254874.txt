A steer can neither be a father nor give milk . A steer is just beef on the hoof . But last week at the International Livestock Exposition in cattle-wise Chicago , one chunky little black hornless steer brought $7,835 , making its steaks and loins worth about $12 per lb . This steer was Lucky Strike , an Aberdeen-Angus , + grand champion of the show . Elliott Brown , 20 , of Rose Hill , Iowa , who raised Lucky Strike , said he would use his prize and auction money to lift the mortgage on his father 's farm , to go to college . Chainstoreman James Cash Penney , who bought the costly calf , donated it to Chicago 's United Charities , which was not quite sure what to do with it . Lucky Strike weighed only 920 lbs .
