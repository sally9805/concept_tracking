" Sandino 's ammunition is practically gone . In so far as Nicaragua is concerned , he is finished and is simply trying to escape . " <P> Just a month ago the above optimistic information was considered so authentic that it formed the nub of a report to the U. S. Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee cabled by Rear Admiral David F. Sellers , commanding the U. S. special service squadron in Nicaragua . At the same time a prominent Marine field commander in Nicaragua , Major Archibald Young , was quoted as saying that the greatest difficulty encountered by his men was from wood ticks &; fleas . <P> Last week the validity of the Rear Admiral 's official report and the Major 's off-hand statement was rudely challenged when the forces of General Augusto Calderon Sandino killed five more U. S. Marines , thus bringing the total of Marine deaths for the past year to 21 . <P> The Marines killed last week were part of the detachment of 36 commanded by Lieut . Edward F. O'Day , who was escorting 85 unloaded pack mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base at Condega in Northern Nicaragua . <P> As the column wound up a narrow valley and topped the rise it came plump upon an encampment of Sandinistas who had bivouacked at an abandoned ranch house , after taking the elementary precaution of planting a machine gun to command the valley . Despatches differed as to whether it was the Marines or the Sandinistas who were most surprised . The outcome , disgraceful to the U. S. Marine scouting service , was a prolonged pitched engagement . Only the fact that another Marine patrol , under Capt . William McNulty was in the vicinity , and rushed up at the sound of firing , prevented an ugly outcome . Eventually , the Sandinistas were driven to withdraw into the underbrush , and jungles , which is their natural and protective element .
