In Paris , cocky William Lawrence ( " Young " ) Stribling touched gloves again with Primo Carnera , the Brobdingnagian Italian carpenter who recently beat him on a foul ( TIME , Dec. 9 ) . In the clinches Stribling strained and sweated against a body 85 Ibs. heavier , 12 in. taller than his own . In the sixth round he hit Carnera in the stomach . Carnera 's vast legs buckled . He knelt a minute , then rose . In the seventh round little Stribling 's punches angered Carnera . A strange expression contorted his wide face . The bell was ringing as he rushed at Stribling , swung at him three or four times , then hit him on the head and knocked him down . The referee hoisted Stribling up , disqualified Carnera , evened the Carnera-Stribling foul score .
