The President 's agricultural Conference , consisting of nine men , heads of various grange and farm organizations , after existing for nine weeks , brought in its first findings . In doing so , it laid down the program which it affects to follow . It said , first , that there are a number of good reports on agricultural conditions and that it is not necessary to make more elaborate ones . Instead it will strive to submit concrete recommendations . <P> Pursuant to this plan , it will submit five reports : <P> 1 ) On the emergency in the livestock situation . <P> 2 ) On necessary legislation . <P> 3 ) On the Government problems which farmers can and must solve for themselves . <P> The first of these reports , on the live stock emergency , was then offered . <P> In recent months there has been a heavy liquidation of the cattle industry , mainly because of the calling of loans by private financing agencies , and partly because of a shortage of feed . The liquidation was made necessary by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . Breeding stock is now reduced so that there is little ' likelihood of ' future overproduction . Four adjustments are necessary : <P> Finance . The private agencies which formerly made loans have suffered setbacks which have restricted their loans . The result is a shortage of primary discount agencies . The Federal Intermediate Credit Bank is fully equipped to finance the primary discount agencies-in short , there is a good financial middleman , but too few financial retailers . The Federal Farm Loan Board should encourage the setting up of more financial retailers and make a report on its progress by July 1 . <P> Transportation Costs . Because of flat increases in freight rates during the War , agricultural products , and especially live stock , bear a disproportionate share of transportation costs . The whole freight-rate structure needs thorough revision . The Conference will later make definite recommendations regarding the agricultural aspects of such a revision . <P> Tariff . The cattle industry needs tariff protection from imported meats and hides . The conference reserves its report on this need , however , until it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Grazing . The policy of free grazing on the Public Domain has resulted 1 ) in encouraging many grazers to enlarge their herds , 2 ) in reducing the grazing value of the range because of overstocking , 3 ) in production of inferior stock . In national forests , on the contrary , where grazing has been restricted , the range and the quality of the cattle has been improved . The unappropriated Public Lands should therefore be leased for grazing purposes with suitable regulations and fees to be determined by a Government committee . <P> In short , the conference recommends better business management to cattle raisers , selection of good breeding stock , scientific management of grazing and winter-feeding areas and careful selection of the class of cattle to be marketed .
