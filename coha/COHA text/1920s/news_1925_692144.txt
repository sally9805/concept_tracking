txt Mayor Hylan received the unanimous support of the Board of Estimate members , sitting in Committee of the Whole Yesterday , in taking preliminary steps to speed the construction of the muchdebated permanent war memorial , to be built at a cost of $840,000 on the site of the southern reservoir in Central Park . While the erection of a war memorial has enlisted virtually universal support , the proposal to place it in Central Park has aroused strong , opposition from individuals and civic organizations who have contended that no structure of any kind not directly for park purposes should be permitted to encroach upon the greatest of the people 's breathing spots in Manhattan Borough . pn the other hand , Mayor Hylan and many of his supporters have argued that the memorial , as ? designed , would beautify the park and replace with a real work of art the unsightly and gseles ? oia reservoir walls . The preliminary step taken yesterday was the approval , on Mayor Hylan 's motion , of the contract for architectural services and the award - terefor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $44,791.90 . It was Mr. Hastings 's design for the memorial which was approved by the Board of Estimate last year . Under the adopted resolution he is now empowered to pre pare the , detailed plans and specifications and to assume supervision , over the grading and construction work . Approval ? of the architee s contract , which sanction had been pending in Committee of the Whole for more than a year , was necessary before actual construction work could be begun . Craig 's Aid Votes With Mayor . Controller Charles L. Craig , who has opposed the Central Park site , was not in attendance at yesterday 's meeting . His representative . Deputy Controller Frank J. Prial , however , voted with the Mayor an .. all other members of the board . Unanimous adoption of the Mayor 's motion followed a plea made by him in which he declared that he had been working hard to accomplish something in the way of a suitable memorial before retiring from office . He made the plea a personal appeal to his colleagues . mayor Hylan was supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomson . New York State Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars , and Major William F. Deegan , Past Commander of the American Legion , Department of New York . ? After the vote wasi recorded Mayor Hylan said to the other board memhers : " I want to thank you all for going along with me on this proposition . I have a little personal pride in it . " 1 The resolution authorized the Department of Plant and Structures to retain the services of Mr. Hastings to outline the preliminary work of clearing away the stone retaining walls of the old reservoir and grading the site . The lefty already has appropriated through 1 tax notes $600,000 for the enterprise , while $221,184.91 additional has been raised by subscription . The old reservoir is still under the jurisdiction of the . Department of Water Supply , though it was long ago rendered useless by the introduction into the city of the Catskill water . The question was raised yesterday whether the reservoir property should not be turned over to the Park Department before further action was taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later date . A separate fund of $130,000 has been already voted by the city P , r leveling the old reservoir site . Commander Thomson , in his plea for a memorial , said he believed that each of the leading ' National Guard regiments of the city would be pleased to have a room set aside and they would fill ? it With war mementos , but Mayor Hylan explained to ' him that the present plans provided only for an arch memorial and not a building . He said there were some thirty-six acres in the reservoir site , and that " Maybe in the future the idea of a building could be determined . " Some humor was injected into the discussion when Joseph Johnson , Commissioner of Public Works , Manhattan , sub --  stituting for Borough President Julius Miller , said he would vote fpr the memorial if Mayor Hylan would consent to the removal of  --  the " Civic Virtue " statue from City Hall Park . " I agree to that , " said the Mayor . " Indeed , if you will meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at , 1 o'clock , when the moon is clouded , I will agree to help you carry it'away . " Opponents of the Central Park site felt yesterday that . ' the only possible channel through which they might now appeal would be by recourse to court action . As stated in the Board of Estimate calendar yesterday , the proposed plans " have received the necessary approval of the Committee on Permanent War Memorial ( of which Rodman Wanamaker is Chairman ) , of the Commissioner of Plant and Structure* , the Art Commission and the Commissioner of Parks of the Borough , of Manhattan . " With equal frankness the calendar noted the fact that " communications in opposition to the project had been received from the Parks and Playgrounds Association , the United Neighborhood Houses DZ New ' York , the New Stork Chapter of the Society of Landscape Architects , . the Fifth Avenue Association , the New York Board of Trade and Transportation , the City Gardens Club , the City Club of New York . and the Municipal Art Society of New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adopted a resolution approving the project in general , but the questions of making the authorized funds available and of approving the final contract for the architect 's services were at , that time referred to the Committee of the Whole . Since April ; 1924 , the ratter items have come up on the calendar repeatedly , but until yesterday they always had been laid over . Both Major Deegan and Commander Thomson declared after the meeting that while they and their veteran associates wanted en appropriate war memorial and appreciated Mayor Hylan 's work in behalf of that project , they had no desire to enter into any controversy concerning the memorial site . Still Opposed to Park Site . William Bradford Roulstone , President of the Parks Conservation Association and counsel to the Parks and Playgrounds Association , commenting upon the board 's action last night , said ; " We certainly should build an adequate war memorial and . it ought to be the grandest and zuost impressive thing of the kind that we can achieve . But it ought not to be put up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Hylan will antagonize a great many people if he proceeds to do that . But that is the way he does everything . " The old reservoir should be demolished and its site graded and made a permanent park area . That area ought never to be built upon under the plebs of any architect whatever . As a matter of fact , no architect , be he eller so distinguished , ought ever to be permitted to build anything in Central Park . That is a landscape architect 's job . And no building should be .. placed in the park which is not distinctively for park purposes and which does not harmonize perfectly with the park 's design and character . " I do not presume to speak in advance for the associations which I represent further than to say that they are already on record against this HylanHastings impropriety . " If Mayor Hyman wished to leave behind him a memorial of some worthiness to himself , let him drive out of the west side of the park the subway contractors who have torn up the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a construction camp there in the name of subway building . The way - that subway is being built and the damage it is doing to Central Park will be one of the things for which the Hylan Administration will be remembered and despised . Everybody knows that this subway work could be made to proceed under cover , as it did along Broadway . " I certainly hope that by a union of all oour forces we can build a war memorial where It ought to be built and in the way it ought to be built , and that will never be in the park . T am of the opinion , - further , that if only $800,000 is available , that is a paltry sum compared with what ought to be spent for such a purpose . I have already made a suggestion , which I should like to repeat , that a most appropriate memorial would be a memorial park somewhere on the East River , without a single building in it , but made , beautiful and restful , rather than the site for a structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the architects ' description of the memorial and its environment , as it is proposed to develop them , a long report was sent to the Board of Estimate some time ago . After dwelling upon the obsolete , useless and unsightly character of the old reservoir site , the report said : ' " Here are approximately , thirty-seven acres in the heart of Manhattan Island almost forgotten and - difficult to find . At the - very inception of our study and in consultation with a committee of experts , it was agreed that the rigid walls of the reservoir shoud be- removed- and about three-fourths of the area treated in a rural character , to conform with and add to the existing park , but ' a provision should be made for a lagoon similar to the one in the Mall in Washington , which leads to the new Lincoln Memorial . This lagoon would occupy the remaining fourth of the area , The usual winding paths , already adequately Provided in the park , might be omitted from this rural portion approximately fifteen acres on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide wide expanses of playgrounds for children , secluded from the east and west park drives and the lagoon by adequate planting , hiding - the necessarily somewhat ' unkempt character of these grounds . " The memorial itself would be placed on the ? narrow strip of land now lying between the larger upper : reservoir and the reservoir in question ; " The city is already contemplating an inter-communicating road between the Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum ; this would connect with the lower or southern end of this ' lagoon and at this connection the road will be so widened as to form a terrace- with steps descending to the water level We believe that this thoroughfare " will serve a gong-reit want , not only in making a much-needed connection between the two museums , but also a direct connection between the east and west sides of the city , creating a ( xnost important and what w uld become a much used circulation . " As finally agreed upon , the monument forms a screen or peristyle comparatively low , with central feature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central scrulptural feature which surmounts the fountain or cascade of water . In the open arcade at either side of the central feature , statues or groups will be placed to represent allegorical or historical features of the great war . Behind the central feature is placed a small room as seen in plan , to ' provids space for war relics , inscriptions , memorials in the wall , &c.";
