txt The Chicago convention had been adjourned , as Chairman Lodge declared , " without date . " The hands were playing and crowds were cheering for Harding and Coolidge , when two men , with the din of the convention 's big microphones still zinging in their ears , slipped away in an open automobile and began a tour of the city to find out " some of the things behind Sinclair Oil . " They sped out on the boulevards and parks to the large open " Sinclair Oil 's " corner lots so large and so well equipped that at least half dozen automobiles can make their intake of , oils and gasoline at the same ' time . They watched the filling of the new glass pumps that so effectually- meet the wish of the customer to see what is given him in quantity and quality . They found-that some of these stations cost , as Bag .. $50,000 and that they are not rented out or on leased land . They are owned by Sinclair Consolidated from the ground up . These , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the country 11S new distributing stations open July 1 . The cost of distribution from refinery to the motor car was narrated as from.21/2c. per gallon in the summertime to 71/2c. in mid-winter when trade is lighter . Each filling station visited is selling now about 3,000 gallons daily and Sinclair gasoline seems very popular in the West . The superiptender.t of Sinclair refineries was picked up from his home and at midnight , 30 miles away over the Indiana line , the watchmen at the Sinclair works were noting the strange appearance of two white shirt fronts examining stills , tanks , pumps , pipe lines , loading stations , wax works , etc . Oil refineries work 24 hours in the day . Toward 2 o'clock in the morning the question was put to SuPerintendentR . P. Sawyer , who is in charge over all the ten Sinclair refineries in the country : " Did you make the plan for these two hundred acres of ground , railroad tracks , refining machinery and storage , and could you now improve upon the plant ? " The response was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , but if I were called upon to duplicate them tomorrow , I would not change a single line . " Then followed detailed investigation of costs , valuations , output , etc. , the result of which may be stimmarize as follows : . First , oil refining as laid out by the East Chicago - work : of the Sinclair company is a matter of capital rather than of labor . At present there are 500 men employed in construction , but when finished the works will be operated by less than 200 men . Second , Sinclair is undervalued in respect , to its refineries . A modern oil refinery can not be built for less  --  than S1,000 per daily barrel capacity . Some large refineries stand at $1,500 cost per daily barrel capacity . Third , Sinclair construction is of the most enduring character  --  steel , brick and cement . The chimney stacks ? are J.50 feet high and the machinery is planted on cement foundations so as to be without vibration . Fire hazards are attended to , and there is room for growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " cracking " processes are of the latest type . At Chicago , the Sinclair refinery is putting through 1:3,000 barrels a day and next month will have its capacity up to 15,000 . barrels . Next year its maximum capacity should be reached at 21,000 barrels per day . The capacity of the Texas-Oklahoma pipeline is 15,000 barrels per day and tank cars will deliver the 3,000 additional barrels of oil from other fields . At present the demand for crude oil at neighboring refineries is so great that the surplus is readily disposed of for spot cash . Two checks for crude oil from Sinclair stores recently passed , one for $3,000,000 and the other for $2 , - 100,000 . " Trifles , " said Sinclair , " in a business having always on hand 90 to 45 millions in oil and supplies . " The total capacity of the ten refineries of the Sinclair Co. will be 55,000 barrels per day , and the output should be maintained at 50,000 barrels per day . The high price for labor , materials and money has changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be solidification and the upbuilding of production and earnings . If found desirable the construction account can he closed next year upon the completion of the Chicago works and the rebuilding and improvements at the Coffeyville refinery which is the oldest refinery of the company . If , however , the drilling now going on at Panama and Costa Rica shows oil in quantity , there must be tanks and tankers to coin gold therefrom . Present indications are of valuable oils in these fields . In the first Sinclair drillings at these points , both wells were lost by reason of deficient pipe after the Panama well had reached 1,600 feet and the Costa Rica 1,100 feet . It is a singular circumstance that at last reports the new pipes were down to these exact depths . Sinclair output in this country was recently stated at 20,000 barrels per day net , and when Mr. Sinclair looked at the sheet to see if the statement was correct he found the run that day was 2.1,000 barrels per day net . " But , " , he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinclair is not building on flush production . " Approaching the final process in gasoline treatment , the giant agitators rising against the sky , a whiff of sulphur was caught that made Archie Roosevelt cough as though in the trenches . " What is that ? " the superintendent was asked . And the response was : " The final process in refining gasoline ,  - -  - the removal of the sulphur . " " Does every refinery take it out ? " " Oh , no . . Sinclair gasoline removes it . but some refiners take ; a short cut when there is n big demand and do not put their gasoline through the agitator to remove the last sulphur . But nobudy makes better gasoline than Sinclair unless it is a small refiner turning out an aviation gasoline or something above the standard because he can not sell in competition on the U. S. Government standard . " There is no reason , to doubt Mr. Sinclair 's Ft ntement that behind its $50,000,000 notes recently issued is not only $50,000,000 worth of refineries , but $50.000,000 worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duplicated for S50 .. 000,1:00 and oil properties that can not be duplicated for twice $50,000,000 . At the Chicago Convention people from Texas and Oklahoma were interrogated as to the standing of the Sinclair company . They replied that it was of the best in the Southwest where people could not understand how Sinclair shares could sell in Wall Street so far belciw local values for the properties . People front the Southwest also declared it was a ? rime to burp American oils fur fuel ; that processes in oil refining haw now progressed so far that only SS need he left for fuel and that almost everything else can be refined into it product more valuable than in competition with coal . This was confirmed at the Sinclair Oil refinery where it was said that everything was now refined to an industrial service except the last which was the residuum now sold as coke in a quick market at $17 per ton . There is 25% of gasoline by distillation , 15 , . -e more by cracking , then kerosene , once the sole product of value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gasoline and the coke . Then there are seven base oils into which are made nearly 50 distinct lubricating oils of standard value in the mechanical world , and so on down to wax , the base of chewing gums and the residual coke . Time is going to demonstrate that Sinclair was right when he declared fuel oil a crime against man and nature and that the real commercial prize still is where John D. Rockefeller . found it , in the refining and merchandising of petroleum products . And here it is just a question of the amount of capital that a company from earnings , or from security holders , can put into the business .
