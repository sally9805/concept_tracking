txt No black cutaway and no high starched collar for AI Smith tomorrow night when he steps into the big hour ? thus far  --  of his career and accepts the Democratic party 's nomination for the presidency of the United States . At the question , Will it be the black cutaway and the black scarf tomorrow night ? " Al Smith looked up from a document he was signing . Ile looked up so abruptly that I thought that at last ho was going to snub me for asking the ultimate in trivial questions In a time of stress . Not at all . He was interested . He said : " No . That double breasted gray suit , and a bow tie . Black cutaways are for weddings and funerals . That old fashioned statesman stuff do n't convince anybody now . I looked over Hoover 's outfit in the pictures and he wore a sack . " That 's Just Like AI . . All this  --  both in what AI Smith Imparted and In his hearty , good natured manner of imparting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the man , It was eloquent of his slmplicity and his unspoiled bonhomie . There is no other public man in any country whom I would feel like asking , on the eve of a history making utterance , what he was going to wear when he made that utterance , Something equally characteristic followed . It was rehearsal of tomorrow evening 's ceremony . The nominee descended nearly to the bottom .. cf the capitol 's seventy-seven graniteo.steps , tip which Theodore Roosevelt used to run as part of his daily dozen when lie was governor of New York . Reaching the lowest landing of the steps , whereon has been erected Use temporary platform from which ho will deliver the hour long speech of acceptance , Al Smith took charge of the rehearsal with all of the zest of Belasco . A Ilappy Moment . He bossed the job . He managed the photographers . He responded to the throng which looked on from beneath the elms of the capitol 's lawns and which roundly cheered him . The sun was bright . A warm but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was aglow . Ills eyes danced , His Melee was full and strong . He was getting the feel of the great , the impending hour . The carpenters around him laid down their hammers and removed their hats . The people pressed closer . His body guard , Sergt. William Boyd of the state police , never took his eyes off hint . Ho jumped into rehearsal . tie was vehement , responsive , patient , jocular . And once more he proved  --  what he often maintains  --  that tie is a good actor . " Now a little bit of talking , Governor , " the photographers called to . him . You know how silly most public men look when the photographers put them through such make believe . On such occasions Mr. Coolidge looks positively simple , and Mr. Hoover Is mute and forlorn . Mr. Smith was not . He caught up the words , " Now a little bit of talking , " and with vigorous gestures , he roared them forth as though he were reading the declaration of independence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' More of it again , " the photographers demanded . Smith , again catching up their words , and with an exipression of passionate fervor , shouted : " . More of it again  --  and yet more ; and yet again more , and , once more , morel " ? Impressive gestures accompanied the words , but the man was not making himself loOk ridiculous . Ile was , as actors say , " in the part . " " Now use the other arm , pavernor. " cried the delighted photographers . " Now use the other arm , " he gravely repeated , and with equal gravity added , " the other arm do n't work so welL " " Now , " his tormentors ordered , " now , lean forward a little and Keep talking ! " " Lean forward a little , " Al Smith said In a kind of chant , and added , when he had done it , " Well , there it is , and that 'll probably show In the picture . " Dy this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't need any golf today for exercise . " So that was the way that went , and he had a grand time . They 'll Say It with Music . The music of the ceremonies will tell the story of Al Smith 's life . When he appears the band will play " Hall to the Chief . " That is a tribute to the governor of the . Empire ' state . While he is descending the steps to the speakers ' stand the bands will Play " The Sidewalks of New York . " That is in remembrance of the child of the tenements . When he reaches the speakers ' stand , the bands will play " The Star Spangled Banner . " And that represents the child of the tenements who made himself a national figure . Canop John N. Roney of the Protestant Episcopal cathedral of All Saints , will make the opening prayer . Tho benediction will be pronounced by the Rt . Rev. Msgr . Joseph A. Delaney of the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception , where Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union will occupy seats near the nominee .
