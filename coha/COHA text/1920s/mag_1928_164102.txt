When the hockey season ended last year , with the Ottawa Senators world 's champions , critics said " Watch the Rangers . " The blue-shirted New York team were picked to win this year because they were fast and clever , because their centre , Frank Boucher , is the smartest poke-checker in the game , because their two bald defense men , Ivan ( " Ching " ) Johnson and Clarence ( " Taffy " ) Abel , are heavy and efficient , because Bill Cook , who skates with the rhythm of a moose running , is the highest-paid team captain in the National Hockey League , because Bun Cook , his brother who looks like Lindbergh and is engaged to be married , is surpassed as a skater only by the famed Howie Morenz of the Montreal Canadiens .

They were cut up and gashed-Johnson with the lobe of his nose torn through by a skate-point , Bun Cook with a charley-horse , Frank Boucher with a stitch over his eye . They were tired also from the strain of playing before the hostile and unsportsmanlike crowd in Boston which threw garbage and bottles on the ice , hit the referee in the head with bread soaked in near-beer , and kept quiet when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maroons the Rangers lost the first game , 2-0 . In the second game each team had a goal when Goalie Chabot of the Rangers was hit in the eye with a puck , taken to the hospital . Coach Lester Patrick , famed defense man in his day , put on the goalie 's pads , kept goal for his team , stopped all rushes , was wildly cheered . In the overtime period Johnson passed to Boucher who whipped the puck into the Montreal goal , winning the game 2-1 , with two games left to play .
