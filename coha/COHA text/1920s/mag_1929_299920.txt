To Roger Steffan , onetime Ohio grocery boy , came last week a vice presidency in National City Bank . Many a young bank employe has , disgruntled , alleged that banks promote by seniority , that Age outranks Ability . Yet Banker Steffan , vice president of largest U. S. Bank , is but 36 . Born in an Ohio village , that since has been wiped out to make room for a dam , Mr. Steffan has progressed far from his high school days in which he originated , as a class motto , the aphorism ' ' Impossible is Un-American . " He would perhaps now be more inclined to remark that leading away from aces is uncivilized , inasmuch as he , a member of the Knickerbocker Whist Club , ranks high among bankers who are also bridgers . As an employe of Fuller &; Smith Co. , Cleveland advertising agency , Mr. Steffan played many a rubber in Harry Dwight Smith 's pleasant , photograph-adorned office , wrote also many a TIME advertisement . <P> Young as he is , Mr. Steffan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board Chairman Charles Mitchell was head of National City Co. at 39 and of National City Bank at 44 . National City 's President Gordon Sohn Rentschler was 43 when ( TIME , April 8 ) he took office . And Robert Livingston Clarkson , now absent because of illness , became president of Chase National last year at the same age that Mr. Steffan is today .
