In the 18th Century , when Yankee traders were enterprising and sporting , men wagered guineas along New Bedford and Newburyport waterfronts about fulfillment of time-delivery contracts at Calcutta of clipper-ship cargoes . Last week dark-skinned , poly-tongued Manhattan Coffee Exchange brokers-Greek , Christian , Jew alike-bet furiously on West Indian weather . Could Munson Liner Southern Cross get her 50,000 bags of Rio coffee a-dock at Hoboken before the last trading hour of March ? The 50,000 bags were bought and sold . If a hurricane delayed them the bags might be near but not at Hoboken , and sellers of them would be " short . " Then the buyers could make them " pay through the nose , " as Wall Street 's cruel saying describes the desperate predicament of one who sells what he does not possess . Wireless orders dashed from Manhattan to the Southern Cross 's captain bidding him drive his engines to their limits of safety . The ship pushed north past the Florida keys , past Cape Hatteras , into New York Harbor-before the coffee markets closed for March . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
