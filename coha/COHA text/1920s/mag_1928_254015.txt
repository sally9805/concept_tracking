That was the goal of his record-breaking solo flight from Croyden , England , to the Antipodes . <P> While the huzzahing crowds waited and as he gulped the warm meal his mother had set for him , he told her what he had superlatively done : 1 ) the longest one-man continuous flight ; 2 ) the longest flight in a light airplane ; 3 ) the fastest journey from England to India ; 4 ) the fastest journey from England to Australia ; 5 ) the first non-stop flight from England to Rome . <P> He showed her a map : <P> Mi .
