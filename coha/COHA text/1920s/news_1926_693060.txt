Granted that this shack Is needed In that Immediate vicinity . could It not be placed underground or In the rear of the monument or on the roadway adjoining the curb ? Some time ago . I wrote to the authorities about this and received a courteous communication from Park Commissioner Gallatin expressing regret that the Board of Estimate had refused or neglected to appropriate the money needed to remove this shack to another location . It Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of the Common Council of three generations ago , of the present , Board of Estimate and Apportionment . P. F. OW . West Englewood , N.
