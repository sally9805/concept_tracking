It has pct been proved , nor do I believe it can he Proved , that my action was not beneficial both to the Government and the navy . The Senate had known of these leases for nearly two years , and yet had done ' nothing to stop them until the passage of the Walsh resolution . On May 4. 1922 within a month after the signing of the first lease , I explained to a Senate committee the joint action of the Interior Department and the Navy Department and the purpose of the leases , and that testimony will be found on Pages 1S0 to 186 , " Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations , United State Senate , SixtySeventh Congress . Second Session . on H. R. 11228 , a Bill Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fiscal Year Ending June 30 , 11423 , and for Other Purposes . " Below are given questions among others asked by Senators and replies thereto made by me : " Q ? This is a very interesting topic and , of course , interrelates with our fuel propcsition , but it is almost academic at this time . " Secretary Denby  --  The purpose of that oil , until a certain figure is reached , is to have a reserve , called the War Reserve , which is arrived at by the study of the General Board of Officers in the department of the amount of storage of fuel oil that should be had in view of any possible emergency : and the department will neither use the cash nor use the oil until after those reserves are set up .

I notice in the report from you and the Secretary of the Interior that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reserves bee fore measures were taken to protect ourselves . " Secretary Denby ? ' That is a matter that the Department of the Interior would know about very much better than we would ; but as soon as it was discovered that such was the situation I asked the Secretary of the Interior if he would undertake to handle it for the navy thereafter , and we went to the President and secured the executive order transferring the naval oil reserves to the Secretary of the Interior to administer in trust for the navy , the Secretary of the Navy being a party to the policies , but not to the actual administrative work . For instance , I signed the Teapot Dome lease because we discovered that that also was being drained off . " Says Courts Will Clear Him . In the hope that my resignation will relieve the Administration of embarrassment , I go gladly and fearlessly . The disaster that has overcome these plans made in the interest of the American people is that a serious charge of corruption has been laid against them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its officials , and if these charges should be established there is no rectification of the moral situation except by the ' return of these properties to the Government , for no man should be allowed to hold any business that he obtained by wrongful means . My own vindication and that of the Navy Department win come with the proper ventilation of all questions connected with these leases In the impartial courts , All a private citizen , if I have committed any offense against the law , EDWIN DENBY , Secretary of The Navy . am still subject to action . I am able to fight my own battles , but I can not fight slander protectea by Senatorial immunity . No one more . than I can more deeply deplore fraud or corruption in public or private life , and where such guilt is shown it should be rigorously punished . hePresident has stood up manfully for right and justice . The sportsmanlike thing for me to do is to relieve him of the further embarrassment of continued political manoeuvres and partisan political trickery .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
