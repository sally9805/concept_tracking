British law intervened last week to prevent the King-Emperor from reading an account of the affairs of his best known subject . Of the subject Mme. Sarah Bernhardt once said : " He is the greatest of all pantomimics . " Yet Parliament recently passed a law ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) forbidding the publication of sensational divorce details . Therefore though George V. , R. I. , may have read the London papers never so carefully last week , he read only half a dozen sentences about the cause clbre precipitated last week by an 18-year-old girl who was studying to be a typist before she married Charles Spencer Chaplin , born at London in 1889 , still a Briton . <P> Typical British Account . " The famous cinema comedian , Charles Chaplin , became the defendant in an action for divorce begun yesterday at Los Angeles , the centre of his motion picture activities in the States . Counsel for Mrs. Chaplin secured an injunction restraining him from disposing of his funds or property in California which are said to have a value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered 42 pages of legal foolscap , and were at once printed and hawked about the city of Los Angeles at a shilling a copy . " <P> To these meagre details the Daily Mail added a sarcastic comment that it would not risk printing a picture of Comedian Chaplin , lest this constitute a legal breach . <P> Suppression . British editors were obliged to throw into their wastebaskets thousands of words cabled from the U. S. Allegations kept out of the British press : <P> MRS . CHAPLIN 'S <P> That she was " a virtuous and innocent girl about two months past the age of 16 years " when he " seduced her under promise of marriage . " <P> That " upon discovery by the defendant of the condition of the plaintiff , the defendant delayed the marriage for a long time in an effort to induce the plaintiff to prevent the birth of said child by submitting herself to a criminal operation , and so conducted himself that the plaintiff 's physical condition became publicly and generally known at the time of their marriage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his marriage : " Well , boys , this is better than going to the penitentiary , but it wo n't last long . " <P> That he boasted of his affairs with " five movie actresses , " threatened Mrs. Chaplin with a revolver , and " always detested " their two children . <P> MR . CHAPLIN 'S <P> That , two years ago , " Lita was a big , well-developed girl and I never thought she was only 16 years old . ... I thought she loved me . I certainly loved her . I wanted six children-if I could have any- and she said she did , too . ... I had dreams of children . I wanted them , longed for them , hoped for them , but because of my experiences with my first wife , Mildred Harris , I thought I was incapable of fatherhood . <P> " Lita 's mother often suggested to me that I marry Lita and I said I would love to if only we could have children . Mrs. Grey deliberately and continuously put Lita in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my house and the mother would go and leave Lita and me alone . She even insisted that Lita and I occupy the same berth on our trip to Mexico " after which they were married .
