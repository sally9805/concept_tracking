General Juan Vicente Gomez , for 20 years dictator of Venezuela , who recently refused to serve as President for another term , but moved by the earnest pleadings of the entire Venezuelan Congress , accepted the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Venezuelan Army , last week found active use for his new title . <P> Foolhardy General Jos Rafael Gabaldon raised the flag of revolt against blue-spectacled General Gomez in the distant provinces of Lara , Trujillo , and Portuguesa with an army variously estimated at 50 and 500 men . Venezuela 's old Commander-in-Chief moved quickly . Against the 50 ( or 500 ) rash rebels he sent the troops of General Eustoquio Gomez , of General Pedro Maria Cardenas , of General Lon Jurado Felix Galavis and of General Juan Fernandez . To Acting President Juan Bautista Perez he sent the following telegram : <P> " Five generals with a force large enough to exterminate a number of unpatriotic countrymen who have uprisen in the states of Lara , Trujillo and Portuguesa , left yesterday for those districts . Exterminate this nest of rebels from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evil doers who should be exterminated radically by material force of the government . " <P> The five loyal generals , with ten ( or 100 ) rebels apiece to exterminate , marched their troops bravely to the extermination .
