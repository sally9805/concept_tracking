( See front cover ) <P> Nominee Smith , with a formidable collection of advisers and impediments , entered the Midwest last week on the first militant move of his campaign ( see Democrats ) . Missouri 's inflammatory Senator James A. Reed was about to pass through to arouse the Northwest . Democratic money was pouring into Missouri , Illinois , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Nebraska , the Dakotas . The Brown Derby was out to line up the 1924 LaFollette vote . <P> Nominee Hoover , having paid his respects to the Midwest on his return from Notification ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) , and having inspected the work that has been done for him there , was content to leave the region 's defense to his Chicago headquarters and to Nominee Curtis , who set out from Washington to criss-cross the trails of Smith and Reed for 5,000 miles .

When Dr. Work goes to New York he feels free to issue suggestions and vetoes to Senator Moses . When he goes to Chicago , as he did on the eve of the Smith invasion , he just sits and listens to Mr. Hoover 's Good . <P> The eleven States of the Midwest with their 149 electoral votes are to the G.

Herbert Hoover began looking around for a Midwestern manager . It was natural for him to ask James William Good , a onetime ( 1909-1921 ) Congressman from Iowa . Secretary Hoover had known Congressman Good as an able legislative Committeeman . He came from Cedar Rapids , near the Hoover birthplace ( West Branch ) .
