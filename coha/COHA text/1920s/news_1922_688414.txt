txt Two deputy sheriffs were carried to sea last evening on the steamship Assyria of the Anchor line , when they insisted on seizing 4,000 cases of Scotch whisky on a writ of replevin sued out by the defunct Alps Drug Company of this city . Customs officials and prohibition agents had refused to permit the sheriffs to remove the whisky from the vessel . The sailing of the Assyria at S:30 last night followed wrangling between the deputy sheriffs and the Government agents for five hours , during which : h. : deputy sheriffs were warned that if they dared to move one case of the whisky to the pier at the foot of West Twenty-fourth Street they would be locked up by the prohibition agents on a charge of violating the Volstead art for having the liquor in their possession without a permit .

The steamship official Immediately notified Colonel 0 . G. Ferrer , the revenue officer guarding the liquor on the pier . Colonel Forrer demanded sight of the writ of replevin , which called for the seizure of 4,000 cases of the liquor of a certain brand . " I do n't know about this , " commented Colonel Forrer as he examined the writ . " It seems to me that the Government will have something to say before you will be permitted to seize that liquor .

In the meantime Deputy Sheriff Rooney had served another copy of the writ on the superintendent of the steamship piers , and when the deputy sheriffs returned from the Assyria with the announcement that the copies of the writ had been served on Captain Rome and the other , Rooney said , " Well , let 's go .
