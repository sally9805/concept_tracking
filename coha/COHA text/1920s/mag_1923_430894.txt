WHAT is the truth about consumers ' co-operation in the United States ? Is it , as frequently assumed , usually a failure ? Or does it succeed ? The greatest alleviation of Europe 's middle classes before the war , co-operation is to-day their most substantial conservative hope . Does it offer us also a way out of our economic difficulties ? He who buys food for the family , fuel for the furnace , gas for the flivver , milk for the baby , shoes , blue jeans , or bonnets , must know something about these difficulties . He is interested in means to reduce their cost . Co-operation , however , is a curdled term , soured by abuse . It is most frequently used to describe that ineffectual state of goodwill said by a wit to be an agreement by which one cooes and the other operates . To define , we mean a method by which ordinary retail customers may undertake on their own behalf distribution of any sort of supplies . The tested , genuine method used successfully round the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society is formed from those ultimate users who finally foot the bills of labor and capital . This group acts in straight defiance of the great national sneer , " We are not in business for our health ! " Genuine Rochdale co-operators are in business strictly for their health and distinctly not for profit . They aim to effect economies by eliminating all services which add to price but not to value . They sell goods for cash at current market prices . The public is welcome to buy at their store . Savings are divided periodically between patronage dividends and various reserve funds . They govern their enterprise on a one-man , one-vote basis , giving every member the same representation and power as in a town meeting . Only legal interest is paid on stock . Each member on buying his shares pledges that he will conscientiously patronize his own shop and help to supply the mental elbow grease necessary to make the business succeed . Loyalty is the elixir of cooperation . The society is no close corporation : " All for each and each for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual service for mutual benefit . The largest possible number of people in a reasonable area are induced to join . For that reason the price of shares is set low . These shares are withdrawable , provided that reduction of working capital will not jeopardize the enterprise . A further safeguard is the rule that the number of shares one person may hold is limited , since some large owner , displeased , might withdraw and endanger the investment of others . We are talking , then , of neighbors who go into business on a mutual , democratic basis . Excluded from consideration are the exceedingly effectual combinations of merchants who pool orders for wholesale buying and mask themselves under the term co-operative ; likewise the cutprice shops which employers set up within their plants to make wages go farther . Unions of producers for selling are also outside our field . The United States boasts more than three thousand consumers ' collective buying enterprises . Nearly half are buying groups subsidiary to farmers ' marketing organizations , which , to become permanent , reorganize on the Rochdale pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groceries or department stores , but including societies  | to supply things as varied as moving pictures , coffins , houses , and laundry . There are at least five federations , one including eighty stores , to do wholesale buying . The Co-operative League of America and government reports agree in showing that our co-operative system ? if anything so disjointed deserves so orderly a name ? now spreads continentally from Anchorage , Alaska , across Canada , over virtually every state in the Union , down to St. Thomas , on the Caribbean Sea . Unheralded , obscure , it is estimated that it diverts from common channels of trade probably two hundred millions a year . According to one of the chief information bureaus advising merchants and financiers , co-operative developments can not be lightly dismissed . Three years ago this agency warned its clients that on every side workers were organizing their own distributive enterprises , citing the fact that in several instances American co-operatives had put private stores out of business . The bureau stated that the time was past for boycotts , and prophesied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or economy on the part of private business could beat it . In 1922 , a second warning was issued advising that prices be lowered ; otherwise the genuine cooperative movement , affected by oppression only in about the same degree as business at large , would gain fresh momentum . Americans have become involved in this troublesome sort of venture only because there is something the matter . The consumer is like David Harum 's dog infested with fleas . Hosts of middlemen live upon him . That is nothing new , and so long as they were not too rapacious they helped him to forget he was a dog . He allowed that perhaps they had as much right to live as he had . Then ( some years ago ) he discovered that , with the natural-historical multiplication of middlemen-fleas , he was literally in danger of being eaten up . Yelping proved ultimately useless . He had more and more trouble finding a bone to gnaw . Food rose sixty per cent between 1915 and 1917 . He was obliged to do something about that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to divide ; but there was suddenly too little . That accounts for the determined interest in co-operative buying of everything from needles to automobiles which , during a journey through the United States , I encountered in everybody , from tea-party people down to comparative grub-worms in mortal coil . Only two sorts of people failed to show some knowledge or curiosity , the direly rich , who do not need co-operation , and the direly poor , too enervated to get it . To see how American consumers of different sorts proceed , why they succeed or fail , and to assess the value of their experience , I visited more than a hundred stores , labor or farmers ' headquarters east and west , private business men and state departments where new enterprises are recorded . Of everybody I asked questions . One merchant summed up his opinion of consumers brusquely : " They do n't know how and will never learn . Co-ops do n't amount to anything . They do n't last . " He cited failures in the past . I stated present facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a highly convincing manner . The Franklin Co-operative Creamery owned by consumers in Minneapolis ? has an annual business of $1,500,000 . The Tamarack Store at Calumet , Michigan , has $1,000,000 . The Calumet shop is twenty-five years old and customarily turns over its stock sixteen times a year . Its fourteen hundred members received in 1920 a 10 per cent dividend on their purchases during the year . All told , it has returned to members in interest and dividends $1,595,184.84 . In Minnesota and Michigan there are several stores with a business of about half a million dollars which are paying good dividends . At Ishpeming is a " co-op " thirty years old  | which has returned to members in dividends $320,000 , far more than its capitalization . It has a trade of about $300,000 a year and owns substantial property . According to incomplete figures from the Labor Department in 1921 , there were at least 18 co-operatives with annual business ranging from $200,000 to $400,000 ; and more than 30 with sales of $100,000 to $200,000 . The number with a turnover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many pay dividends ranging from I per cent to 14 per cent . I determined to test the truth of the business man 's charges . The Riverside store at Maynard , Massachusetts , for example , has contrived to live forty years . How does it happen that 50 per cent of the groceries , meat , milk and bread used in Maynard is bought from the Riverside and three other " co-ops " there ? It would seem that they must amount to something , they must know how , and they must be learning . I went to Maynard . To see the president of the Riverside Society , I followed the narrow main street of the surprisingly ugly mill town . Beautiful soft-bosomed hills surround the unhomelike village . Over the Assabet River , a glorious , rushing , goldengreen stream , a graceless bridge leads past the hard , square , drab barracks in which dwell most of the seven thousand souls accredited to Maynard . The red-brick , mechanical monster of a mill which turns out hard-surfaced mohair dominates the place . The mill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its raucous , shrieking siren , summoning thousands of spinners to work at seven o'clock , rules the population almost as a feudal baron once did his serfs . The absentee lords of the mill have shown only one sign of interest in their people . They did donate a public trough at which horses drink . I found the head of the " co-op , " Mr. Batley , an ex-mill hand who came to this country from England fifty years ago , in a great green house where he now grows flowers for market . His surroundings were as redolent of soft perfumes and resplendent with beauty as the town itself is barren of both . He told me how , unable to make ends meet , the spinners followed the recipe of the Rochdale weavers in England . They determined by voluntary , responsible , safeguarded action , to reduce the cost of living . As purchasers they resolved to supply themselves first with food . Organizing , these Maynard spinners thoroughly understood the difference between owning shares in a joint stock company and in a co-operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save occasional voting , usually by proxy . Investing in a co-operative entails a continuous obligation . Proxy voting is not permitted . The member 's loyalty , shown by delivery of all possible trade to his store , does not stop there . He must do his part in formulating policy and keeping an eye on administration . In the shop which these workers opened in a somewhat inaccessible attic by the side of the Assabet River , the policy they adopted in relation to their stock of goods is a case in point . They selected goods of certain demand , excluding luxuries and limiting variety of brands . Charging full price , giving no credit , operating with minimum expense , they made savings which , at the end of each quarter , were pro-rated among members in dividends according to the amount each had brought to the store , or were set aside for expansion . This surplus is not profit , any more than the money John Jones saves by cutting the grass himself is profit . It serves two purposes . Dividends offer an inducement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual ownership , offer , in fact , the same incentive of personal gain which now drives men selfishly to amass private property . To those of broader vision this surplus represents the means by which such societies shall expand , with the ultimate aim of developing a complete distributive system in the  | hands of consumers . When such a system shall have reached a high degree of continuous efficiency , they believe a cutprice system can be used instead of dividends . The Riverside 's membership functioned faithfully , buying consistently from their own enterprise . When they felt a steady business in hand they moved to a basement . In the seventies enthusiasm swept them into the Sovereigns of Industry , a mushroom organization which attempted to consolidate fifty or more struggling co-operatives . Caution reasserted itself only just in time , but they withdrew before the Sovereigns failed . All the juvenile ills common to cooperation the Riverside experienced : mismanagement , expansion in the wrong direction , factionalism . When the mill paid once a month and there was a common need of credit , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a mistake , often fatal , but the Riverside retrieved its balance . At heart the membership had the metaphysical view of co-operation , conceived it as the savior of mankind , the means by which great common wealth will some day be achieved . The spirit among these citizens coming together for conscious service to their community was so sincere , their merchandising so shrewd , their bookkeeping so good , that they avoided large losses , made a general store of their grocery , and in time bought land on which they built a good double shop with a hall above it . Here they continually held meetings , dinners , lectures , and concerts . It became a village institution . Keeping up their campaign of education , they gained more members . That " co-op " to-day is a friendly if a somewhat conservative spot . Informal town meetings are held by statesmen who sit on kegs and orange boxes ? the once familiar flour barrel having given way to sacks . The society has clear assets of $30,000 . Mr. Batley , displaying the mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never since the very early days has the society failed to make savings to give back to members , returning to each , in proportion to his purchases during the year , 5 per cent dividends when business was indifferent , and as much as 10 per cent in good years . Yet a single shop it began and a single shop it remains . Federation with other stores must be braved and wholesaling must be mastered before co-operation can make large savings . In England many such thrifty stores federated forty years ago . Their wholesale succeeding on a gigantic scale , they proceeded to manufacture fifty or sixty staple articles . They own land in various sections of the world where are grown certain raw stuffs which they use . They now actually administer a billion-dollar annual business and great common property by the same methods as private capital but on very superior principles . With particular interest I inquired why the three other co-operative stores in the town , each organized by the tried old Rochdale method which twenty-five million families in many nations have used with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why had each one fought alone ? In fact , why had other societies ever developed , in view of the original association 's steady prosperity ? One store could better do the work of four , reducing overhead , demanding half as many employees . The reason they started was soon clear . While theoretically the AngloAmerican Riverside believes firmly that the doors of the society should be wide open to any and all new members , when Finnish mill hands began to pour into the town in a human wave , another question arose . Until recently English cooperatives adhered also to the principle that co-operation should steer completely clear of politics . The Finns had strong Socialistic leanings and believed a new political regime should be ushered in simultaneously with a new economic system . The English workers were not  | sympathetic . Neither did they differentiate between Finns ? they all looked alike to the Riverside . At the first rebuff the Finns quietly started another store , called Kaleva , differing from the first in little except that possible dividends on purchases were limited to 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put to reserves . Radicals denounce the incentive of individual return held out to prospective members , declaring even this small bait to be anti-social . For that reason , surplus above expenses and expansion is devoted by societies in Belgium , to Maisons du Peuple , to specific funds from which to pay unemployment , accident or lifeinsurance benefits , and to other provisions for general welfare . But all Finns , as the Riverside was to see , were not alike . That is why subsequently a third " co-op " was set up in further primitive competition . In Finland the co-operative movement split , conservatives abhorring political action , preferring like the English to preach economic salvation alone , looking to the ultimate mastery of distribution , manufacturing , the land itself , housing , and banking . The Socialists , to the conservatives ' disgust , coupled economic action with the governmental paternalism . We have inherited Finland 's division in America , not alone in Maynard and a number of Massachusetts towns , but in the west . In the Kaleva personalities refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else the Riverside might have had opportunity to welcome the dissenters . They withdrew and formed the third store , called the First National . Following the Finns to Maynard , came a new wave of Lithuanian and Ukrainian mill workers . They , too , were used to co-operation in the old country . In the West all these groups might have joined together . In New England traditional " offishness " fosters the isolation of nationals . In time the Slays formed a fourth store , like the others , with fivedollar shares . Recent war antagonism caused the Russians to repudiate the Lithuanians , who struggle along with a lowered membership and trade . Testimony that mutual ownership became distinctly the thing in Maynard was a fifth shop bearing Co-operative across its front . This qne masqueraded ; really it was a link in a state-wide commercial chain which locally played its competitive game , trusting that newer comers would not know the difference between it and the genuine . Later I found the same situation in other places . The two Finnish groceries developed successfully side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Members did not have to be taught loyalty . Once the society 's buying power was organized and methods so systematized that they were fairly sure of holding trade and making a surplus , they , too , extended to new lines of provisioning . Scarcely any business offers so low a margin of legitimate gain as the grocery . The Kaleva set up a bakery . American societies to-day frequently begin with baking . The Purity Co-operative in Patterson has a quarter-million dollars of annual business . Four co-operative bakeries near Boston buy supplies together . Bread customers , once suited , are not hard to keep . The Finns made quantities of their distinctive health biscuit and achieved relatively easy success . A restaurant was opened next , a not uncommon sequence . Milk distribution followed . The town was faced with an interesting situation . The Boston wholesale price , which governs the local price , was so low that dairy farmers were selling their cows ? an unanswerable way of going out of business . The " co-op " decided that farmers were justified , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to maintain the community 's supply , the Kaleva agreed to pay a cent higher than the market price per quart and , abandoning the principle of charging market price , sell at cost two cents less than before . Using their delivery equipment for milk as well as for groceries , they reduced the  | expense of handling . They could not supply their trade . All the farmers tried to sell to the Kaleva , and everybody wanted to buy co-operative milk . Local milkmen tried but failed to combat a group which in the public interest eliminated profit altogether . Kaleva books balanced for the first year with eighteen dollars to the good . They could not serve the entire community . The First National ( nonpartisan Finns ) who had played followthe-leader in expansion from groceries to meat , adding a delicatessen in place of a restaurant , opened a milk station also . The two services have now been going for about three years . The Lithuanians opened a third bakery which , in spite of bad years , still endures . These four groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They handle annually $400,000 of the money Maynard spends for food . As with all genuine co-operatives , their ideal is full weight , good goods , fair prices , and the obliteration of profit as such . They require less advertising , occupy buildings in cheaper localities than private stores , are not obliged to keep goods of doubtful demand , and can retain patronage because of the customers ' personal incentive to make them succeed . The practical advantages just cited cause so astute a merchant as E. A. Filene of Boston to state that , " Theoretically co-operative stores . . . ought to become the stores of the futur : , . ' The facts that non-profit business may eliminate most of our distributive waste , that co-operative employees feel that they are in public rather than private service , and that the philosophy of co-operation supplies new and powerful motives to enter community service , are further reasons why co-operation does ultimately succeed in every land . I went west to see , among other things , a typical Rochdale federation of stores to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperatives which have formed one by one within the last fifteen years . The majority of these are of Finnish membership . Most of them flourished moderately alone but , to get better values through their combined purchasing power , they decided to start the Co-operative Exchange . Between them they found $8,000-also an excellent manager , John Nummivori . They formed a board representative of them all to run the Exchange . Note this : there was no fusion of stores in the wholesale venture . Each was still autonomous . The Exchange was merely their buyer , their employee . This is Old-World technique . With an insignificant capital the Exchange has now for some years done an almost heroic amount of work . For example , in 1919 that sum was turned over 50 times , the stock of goods 16 times . Although service , not surplus , was their aim , on $400,000 business the wholesale organization itself made gross profits of $27,319 and a net profit of $7,330-94 per cent of their capital . Trade was not so good in the ensuing years but net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits also . With such management they were soon able to purchase an excellent small warehouse . So far as their space will permit , the Exchange handles bulk goods like any wholesale dealer , although the largest part of their business is jobbing . The collective trade of the federated and thirty other co-operatives which occasionally buy with them enables the Exchange to secure favorable quotations from manufacturers . If the stores were closer together the Exchange would be able to do a great deal more for them . This federation maintains also a bakery at Superior which does only wholesale business , shipping breadstuffs over a considerable territory . This staff-oflife factory , operated by the wholesale , represents a distinct advance over each little store opening its own bakeshop , as in Maynard . Altogether , these Finns , with a business not yet bulking large and steadily forging ahead , are apparently neglecting  | none of the essentials , They carry on propaganda regarding the right sort of co-operation , reaching many workers through their daily and weekly press . As a result , the Finns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of their northern and eastern brothers . The Central Exchange also considers it one of its first duties to train executives . An excellent school is held every summer at Superior with intensive courses in store management , bookkeeping , accounting , and English . Other successes from coast to coast offer convincing evidence that by unremitting diligence and faithfulness , genuine co-operation does succeed here in spite of the hoodoo of competitive methods . That is not to say Rochdales , improperly managed , do not fail . They do . In general , their practices , like those of most shops , might be largely improved . But when they reach efficiency , what may be called the Federationist plan , exemplified by these Finns and real co-operators the world around , is sound . It is deviation from this plan which has caused much - advertised trouble . The successes have not been similarly heralded . From two other sorts of organization , both non-cooperative , most of the smoke screen of failure has arisen . The first is pure fake . Several impressive , large-sounding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts of four states in the middle west to estop one of these from selling blue-sky stock . The second sort of organization is usually honest , the Centralist conception of consumers ' union . Centralists talk of co-operation but fail to produce it . They desire to devise a legitimate get-rich-quick American variation on safe European methods of cooperation . They have caused American workers to lose probably twenty millions in the last three years . They have not created better stores , but merely more stores where there are already too many . As the Centralists ' conception developed into malignant epidemic among us , it is necessary to hold a short clinic ( or , since most of the enterprises are dead , a post-mortem ) on the disease . Unhappily , its bacteria are still with us and their pathology must be understood . A large percentage of union men belonged to the Centralists . Labor deserves strong praise for its responsible attempts at mutual enterprise . It has shown a sporting spirit about its defeats . It is a pity that its co-operative fervor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had they been , workers ' groups would deservedly possess to-day fine machinery with which to correct obvious evils of the distributive system . Labor lost its great psychological opportunity largely through the bumptious conviction that America did not need to follow Europe 's footsteps . Sharp fear bred into organized labor by industrial conflict made it demand that whatever was done along economic lines should be " big . " A conscientious union leader explained the symptom thus : " Rochdale methods are too slow in this country . Right now workers ' money is being used against workers . Hostile hands now benefit by our immense spending power . Labor banks are starting . We must have stores and wholesales , too , numbers of them , centralized under labor control . " The emphasis was on control , power , not on stores for everybody as cooperators would have them ; stores for labor . Driven by such motives , fear and fighting ambition , labor was looking for an immediately effective weapon rather than a safe and sure means of growth . Industry and finance are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become so or what hosts of small failures occurred before it became consolidated , labor leaders felt that their union of consumers , misnamed co-operative , must begin centralized . They argued without knowing that since 1913 Russia had  | created an immense co-operative system heading up in the Centrosoyius . They declared that even the English were centralizing , confusing voluntary democratic federation with the autocratic centralization of America 's profit-making business . Unfortunately , the majority of union leaders East and West welcomed promoters of the labor-agitator type , who in 1918 concocted their all-American recipe for so-called co-operation , and later opened the National Wholesale in Chicago with branch warehouses near . New York and in Seattle . It was to be a system for cities . Real co-operation advances best in small communities , thriving ill in large cities . Instead of creating a wholesale to serve a federation of stores , they organized a chain of retails to sustain each branch of the wholesale . Observing that , because of lack of experience , Rochdale infancy is often a struggle for efficient teamwork , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , and that fault is often found with executives , the Centralists tried to eliminate most of the teamwork , to run the business autocratically and to escape the inexperience due to youth . They resolved to have no baby-stores whatever but to hatch a litter of post-flapper ones to which the wholesale should be a parental despot , providing for its young , bossing the children , and permitting no back-talk . The Centralist plan , you see , was for haste . Co-operators know they must make haste slowly . To foster real selfhelp , action must be based on majority rule which represents an average of intelligence . The National promoters convinced labor men that the Rochdale plan of selling goods at market price was not feasible , that the retails should be run on the cut-price plan , that chain store administration should be reproduced . They quoted large paper-savings and drew a rosy picture of the strength such a system would add to union organization . They used the arguments of class-consciousness . They worked on syndicalist rather than community lines . Union after union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position to dictate , a privilege usually disregarded save when they wanted the stores to act as commissaries during strikes . To secure funds , organizers were sent out through working class districts far and wide . " Co-operation was sold by calamitous hot-air peddlers like a new somethingto-eat , " asserted one labor man . " I heard stock salesmen tell poor laborers that all they had to do was to put down their original payment on a block of stock and they could eat their way in , paying for the rest of their shares out of the dividends on their purchases . " The stock-selling campaign alone would have brought disaster . In any collectivist affair , men singly or in groups must adopt a new point of view and a new obligation , even if , as in this case , that obligation results as much from the membership of the unions to which workers belong as from individual membership . These professional stock salesmen , first on salary and later on commission , were reckless . They sold shares on labor sympathy alone , paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the buying , in their responsibility to trade at the union store . Propinquity counts in any collective enterprise . These men took but slight account of geography or transportation . The National was heedlessly pledged to serve well and expeditiously retails more than five hundred miles distant . Such preliminaries laid the worst possible foundation for business . Instead of cultivating that individual responsibility , efficient industry , constant supervision , and purposeful faith on the part of members which make genuine co-operation work , the National planned a system in which members were not even to coo and the wholesale was to operate without their interference , because stores would have no way of knowing the details of what was going  | on . True , each store was supposed to have a representative on the wholesale board , and there was supposed to be a store committee in each place , named by the members . But the wholesale hired and fired managers . Often the manager was named as the society 's delegate to the board . The distances , and , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegate to attend all board meetings . The wholesale did as it liked . For months labor was triumphant over three regional warehouses and dependent chains of stores . Attempts were made to affiliate all the existing co-ops with this concern . Two wholesales did form working agreements with the National , the Tri-State of Pittsburg and the Pacific League of San Francisco . These and a third , the Co-operative Wholesale Society in St. Paul , were already showing bad symptoms of Centralism . The St. Paul group , however , would not play with the men in the National . They had previous acquaintance with them . The Co-operative League of America issued warning after warning against false combinations which use the terminology of co-operation and ignore every essential of its practice . It did its best to keep pace with developments . That was impossible . Enthusiasm seized and dominated labor precisely as the boom spirit dominates the inhabitants of a town , even if it be far from a railroad track . Organized labor was far from the co-operative track but pitifully ignorant of the fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the National was non-co-operative in practice , whatever it claimed in principle , and felt no inclination to respond to any invitation to affiliate . Before the year was up trouble began . Labor found out at least that it could not find out what was wrong . Forty-four unions in New York had subscribed large amounts for a warehouse in Hoboken . From the first it was overstaffed and almost empty . Organizers were retained on the payroll . Members learned that their funds had been loaned to Seattle . They were asked for more money . Protesting volubly , the wise ones withdrew . The warehouse remained open for a time . When it was finally closed by the sheriff creditors received one cent on the dollar . Stockholders received nothing . In Seattle the National promoters secured sufficient support , from that faction in labor which incautiously responds to the latest and most flamboyant promise , to open its enterprise in the usual blatant way . They found money to start but not to continue . A director was sent there ; and although the branch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I. W. W. , which had a neighboring office , he permitted stock to be sold . Money was " borrowed " from the Pacific League . While some of the more lively Washington stores saved themselves by seceding from the chain , bankruptcy was inevitable . Finally the promoters in Chicago also found the game beyond their powers . Labor raged because the National twice during strikes failed to act efficiently as commissary . The preposterous bubble burst . Hosts of poor , ignorant workers lost their money . To this day , most of them suppose that the concern was genuinely co-operative . Autopsy on three other wholesales in St. Paul , Pittsburgh , and San Francisco , shows that they were started prematurely , at the instance of promoters who wanted jobs . They obtained support from certain scattered Rochdales which mistook the character of the leadership they were accepting . All of them attempted service which was not economical and therefore they came at last into insoluble difficulty . To escape , they too tried at centralization . They found that they had an incurable disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its consistent result was death . Retails in some instances were involved . Others , like the Riverside in the era of  | the Sovereigns , saved themselves and now regard the experience as salutary discipline . It is , of course , conceivable that consumers ' unions might be operated by one central authority under wise despotism without the loss of the idealism and earnestness which make Roch dales something more than mere shops from which merchandise is obtained . Several groups , protected from the full force of the Centralist epidemic but still feeling its infection , have tried that , for instance , the Central States Wholesale and Union stores , belonging to the Illinois miners . They gave good service for a time but were at last accounts suffering severely from disturbing symptoms similar to other non-co-operative groups . One Centralist venture was financially successful , yet because the experiment was essentially a failure in other respects , its sponsors voluntarily abandoned it . Twenty-odd Finnish stores around Boston , among them the Kaleva of Maynard , decided to be open-minded about this American theory concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment in an entirely different spirit from labor groups , and with excellent technique . They were not newly created stores but good stable ones . They were not widely scattered but close together , within fifty miles of Boston . There was no loud promotion , no flamboyant stock-selling . They soberly decided by common will to merge all their local stores into one organization , which would open a wholesale , operating it and the stores as one concern . Each store had a representative on the wholesale board , which was supposed to have the same full-voiced democracy as a single store society . In operation their wholesale effected marked economies . Transportation was good , service reasonably efficient from wholesale to retails . Managers of the locals , forbidden to buy elsewhere than of their own wholesale , could be dismissed for disobeying this rule . In two years the wholesale considerably enlarged the joint assets ; yet at the end of that time it was found that in practically every case the individual stores were in bad condition . Membership had decreased . Trade was becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The movement , dependent always upon conscious exertion of consumer-members day by day , was dying at the roots . It required moral courage , while they were making money , to dissolve that wholesale for the sake of spreading a faith and enlarging the common understanding of the purpose before them . That purpose is not to make money for a few , but to spread small benefits among the many , to persuade masses of men to cut the waste and extravagance out of distribution of necessities by performing for themselves without profit ( as a woman makes herself a dress on her own machine ) services which otherwise would add to the cost . Finding the business drifting toward a state which was in their eyes pathological , they voted to change their direction . They are now again building up their separate stores , convinced by personal experience of a fact which I have observed in England as well as the United States , that it is usually only limited centralization in stores federated within the limits of one city which can be attained without loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Space permitting , I could give many illustrations to show that the charge that the universal Rochdale method will not work in the United States is rubbish . While our business conditions by no means favor co-operation , neither do they present insuperable difficulties . We must work harder than some other nations to make headway but there is an open possibility that consumers may organize not only a retail system of nonprofit distribution , but master wholesaling and production to satisfy the demands of stores . It depends on two  | factors , understanding and real need of relief . Ask the middleclass man on the street if we do need that relief ! That Rochdale co-operation requires application , efficiency , and self-denial on the part of those engaging in it is admitted . Inattention , loose administration , or failure to deliver pledged custom may work ruin . Yet so long as the enormous wastes and avarice of the profit-making system continue , middleclass consumers will be moved to try , however reluctantly , to help themselves by non-profit methods . Although astute merchants make efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to shorten the route between grower and user by such devices as chain stores , the rule is still , " All the traffic will bear . " Higher tariffs now reinforce prices to which wages , even at their present height , do not bear an equitable relation . The total losses through recent fakes and experiments in co-operative centralization are certainly more than offset in the same period by widespread savings made in successful collective buying through Rochdales and joint purchasing bureaus maintained by farm organizations . Co-operation has at least held its own while proving out the right methods by which to make far greater permanent gains . Faithfully practiced , it should be of vastly greater use now in making wages real . And while men employ co-operation as an expedient measure , they catch glimpses of generally felt benefits that stimulate determination to establish a more valid relation between commercial practice and universal human needs . The hope of gaining new economic liberties by applying democratic principles to business as we did long ago to politics becomes a practical matter .  |    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
