THE SUNKEN GARDEN-Nathalia Crane-Seltzer ( $2 ) . With a poet 's precision it is told how , on Nov. 23 , 1924 , the 16-year-old Duchess of Kendal , later to be known as Orena , was cast upon an Afric isle when her yacht was riven with electric bolts from an oxeye tornado . There she found another " bantling of fate , " whose Nordic features suggested that he was an atavism , or at least a primeval anachronism ; in any case , a monad . Soon he was able to convince her , however , that he was descended from the Child Crusaders of the 13th century , of noble birth-in fact , a Duke of Lorraine . His ancestors , she recalled , had sailed out of Marseilles in gulafres and dromons . Orena thought of a thousand centuries budding and withering , and called him Octans . It was extraordinary that they should be sharing this " tazza " thus . " The absence of conventionality sent the blood to her cheeks . " But " she was cognizant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " innocent intimacy was preferable to unacknowledged proximity . " She grew deeply attached to him ; he of course worshiped her abjectly ; they lived together through months of celestial bliss , gorging on succulent , ambrosial fruits , observing luxuriant inhabitants of the air where " giant ferns grew rank by fetid fens . " Octans neatly despatched a ghost leopard that infested their paradise and all was serene until she asked him to pick a certain blue lotus . Then an " odious ophidian , " a python regius of " lethal length , " " leprous luster " and " fetid folds , " embraced and kissed him so strenuously that he died , shattering her " cordon of dreams . " She hated to leave when the battleship came to rescue her . <P> I have told Natalia that if she writes another novel before she is 18 years old , I do n't know what I shall do .

She will not " do " anything . Did n't she let Mr. Crane give Nathalia a typewriter for Christmas ? Did n't she keep rushing to the encyclopedia at Nathalia 's command to look up African flora and fauna for this prose opus ? Mrs. Crane knows quite well she can " do " nothing about it if Nathalia breaks out again in the next six years . She is perfectly aware that in the girl flows blood , not only from John and Priscilla Alden , but from " the grand old Spanish family , Abarbanel , who counted among their number poets , musicians and a minister of state to Ferdinand and Isabella .
