When newspapers fought each other in the good old , bad old days , it was with edged verb and bludgeoning adjective in their editorial columns . But newspapers fight each other no longer . They now compete . Their battlegrounds are their advertising departments , their weapons statistics . <P> Rival publications , and different statisticians for the same publication , flatly contradict one another 's figures in a way that puzzles the man who buys space . And so , since 1923 , Editor &; Publisher , journalism 's trade weekly , has annually sought to furnish the most nearly accurate advertising lineage figures for a host of U. S. and Canadian newspapers , and these figures are always eagerly awaited . <P> This year , seeking to perfect its service and to establish more satisfactory classifications , Editor &; Publisher obtained 1928 lineage statistics for 387 dailies and Sunday papers in 81 cities from Media Records , Inc. , an independent audit bureau , instead of accepting statements of individual publishers and agents as in the past . In addition to the Media records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 684 cities , compiled according to the old practice . The whole story was edited- &-published; last week . <P> The Media figures showed that the 387 papers had carried a total of 2,629,598,181 agate lines in 1928 . All but about a half-billion of this was display advertising , the rest Classified ( want advts , legal notices and the like ) . In total lineage , the Chicago Tribune stood at the top with 30,874,755 lines ( as against 31,834,173 for 1927 ) . On its heels came the Detroit News with 30,726,436 lines ( in 1927 the News had 30,459,968 ) . Third was the New York Times with 30,641,930 lines ( 1927-29,710,606 ) . <P> The Detroit News led the evening newspapers of the land , followed by the Chicago News , then by the Newark ( N. J. ) News . The bulky New York Sun came eleventh . <P> The leaders in various categories of advertising and various fields of publishings were as follows : <P> Papers published weekday mornings and Sunday : New York Times ( national display ) ; Chicago Tribune ( local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Papers published weekday mornings : Montreal Gazette ( national display ) ; Wilkes-Barre Record ( local display ) ; Los Angeles Times ( classified ) . <P> Papers published weekday evenings and Sundays : Toronto Star ( national display ) ; Detroit News ( local display ) ; Detroit News ( classified ) . <P> Papers published weekday evenings : London , Ont. , Free Press ( national display ) ; Detroit News ( local display ) ; Newark News ( classified ) . <P> Sunday papers : New York Times ( national display ) ; Chicago Tribune ( local display ) ; Chicago Tribune ( classified ) . <P> So soon as Editor &; Publisher 's figures were made public , out spoke the newspapers , protesting variously . The fatherly New York Times , in dignified but sonorous voice , claimed 1928 lineage leadership for itself despite any or all other figures . According to its own figures , the Times won with 30,736,530 lines . Both the Chicago Tribune and the Detroit News conceded that the Times was right , and claimed only 30,512,112 and 30,459,968 lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
