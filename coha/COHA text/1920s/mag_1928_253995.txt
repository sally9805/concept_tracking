Through the lovely , verdant park of Cotroceni , at Bucharest , a pair of steel rails curve in and up to the Palace of Dowager Queen Marie . When a royal train draws nigh it can chuff conveniently into a trig , small station only a few score yards from the palace door . Last week came the train of Her Majesty Queen Marie of Jugoslavia , daughter of Marie of Rumania . <P> Down to the station , last week , romped His Majesty Mihai I , aged six , King of Rumania . He was expecting his cousin , Crown Prince Peter of Jugoslavia , aged four . In the mind of His Majesty there lurked an innocent and hospitable design to kiss His Royal Highness . <P> From the train descended the now rather portly Queen of Jugoslavia . She was preoccupied with her newborn son . Prince Tomislav ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) . Soon Marie of Rumania and the various ladies in waiting were grouped about a bundle that gurgled and cooed . The diversion left His Majesty , King Mihai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Smack ! With childish fervor , His Majesty bestowed a kiss of welcome . He now waited for it to be returned . He continued to wait . Prince Peter , bonny and button-round eyed , gazed vaguely around , oblivious of what was required , but beginning to be slightly concerned about his mother . <P> Disappointed but firm , King Mihai I advanced . " I 'll show you how ! " he volunteered . Grasping firmly the chubby wrists of Peter he sought to haul him close . Unimpressed , the future King of Jugoslavia practiced simple noncooperation until the King of Rumania gave up in disgust .
