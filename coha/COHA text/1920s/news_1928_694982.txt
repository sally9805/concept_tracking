txt To the sensations of a year already notable in aviation , perhaps the biggest of all has now been added by Captain WILKINS . His own account in today 's TIMES of his flight from Alaska to Spitzbergen is of a sort to give a new thrill even to the reader well accustomen to adventures in the air . Captain WILKINS writes his story with the utmost simplicity , but with a clearness and comprehensiveness beyond all praise . The very restraint with which he describes the hazards which marked his achievement from the beginning to the end contains a subtle but powerful appeal to the imagination . Nothing but the utmost stretch of human resolution and daring , combined with technical skill of the highest order and a mechanical equipment which never failed , could have carried Captain WILKINS with his pilot and fit companion , CARL BEN EIELSON , over the formidable obstacles which they encountered , but which never daunted their indomitable spirit . Coming as this success does upon the two partial failures of the Wilkins expeditions in previous years , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic exploration , but as an amazing victory of human determination amounting to genius . And as a writer Captain WILKINS shines as brightly as he does as an aviator . His narrative must impress every one who reads it by his ability to marshal his facts in lucid order and to recount hairbreadth escapes with the detachment of a novelist . All who knew him believed in his uncommon ability , but this revelation of his literary quality must come as a surprise to the general public . The first bare news of his arrival at Spitzbergen was all the more electrifying because of the silence which had preceded it . For days no word of him had come from Point Barrow . The last dispatch , received on April 7 , stated that he was held fast by snowstorms . As April is the best month for flying in the Arctic , it began to be feared that the hopes of Captain WILKINS were destined to be frustrated again , as in the two preceding seasons . But then came the laconic message announcing the end of the unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detailed dispatch explaining his disappearance and the delay , which had caused much anxiety . So the end crowns the work . So bold an undertaking , now brought to the happiest conclusion , has its first appeal as a wonderful adventure . The distance covered by the Wilkins airplane was somewhat greater than that between Ireland and Newfoundland on a great circle . And though the Arctic sky was clearer , on the whole , than the atmosphere which baffled the Bremen off the Labrador coast , Captain WILKINS and his pilot had no lack ) f perils from cloud and storm and cold . Particularly does the story of their waiting on the island of their landfall for the furious blizzard to Subside read like the pages of a romance . But previously the skilled ) bservers had recorded every aspect ) f the sea and sky and had made totes of meteorological changes which will be of the highest scientific value . Most important of all will be retarded the fact that WILKINS flew ) ver the unexplored part of the Arc:le , where he was favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land which it had been suspected might exist in that region . Thus he has cleared up one of the few remaining disputed points in the geography of the world . In addition his successful flight may be held to have confirmed the theory , advanced by Mr. STEFANSSON , among others , that the best route through the air from this country to the Far East will be found to be over the top of the world . From New York to Peking , as the lines of aviation now run , is about 10,000 miles . Of that distance about 3,000 miles could be cut off by flying further north . Hence it may be that Captain WILKINS will be found to have provided most useful data for the future of commercial aviation . But for today , and until all the scientific details of his triumphant voyage through the air are at hand , everybody will be first of all impressed and fascinated by his unprecedented tale of high adventure .                @ @ @ @ @
