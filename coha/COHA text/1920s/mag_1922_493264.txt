ly wise in preferring discretion to valor and in vindicating Mr. White by defaulting On their own original contention . The suit itself was one of the most gross , ugly and inexcusable assaults on freedom of speech which state intoxicated Amer ? ican politicians have yet perpetrated . It indicates only too clearly what may be the result of impos ? ing on political authority the duty of adjudicating strikes in spite of the fact that the social conscience is not as yet agreed upon an industrial code which would provide the basis of a judicial proceeding . The state authority in order to protect itself against the public defiance of its own decisions would have to prevent any comment on them which tended to produce disobedience . The Economic Position of the Farmer T HE farmer has a grievance that he is asserting with steadily increasing vehemence . He is not getting his just share of the national produc ? tion , and everybody knows it . Something , he in ? sists , must be done about it . And although he knows what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to politics for redress . That is the substantial reality behind the Farm . Bloc , behind western progressivism and the inchoate third party . Therefore it is of extreme importance to deter ? mine just how serious and deep seated the farmers ' grievance really is . Is it a mere incident of post ? war depression , pretty certain to disappear of it ? self in a year or two , a conjunction of numerous slight bruises requiring at most only an application of salve here , a shred of plaster there ? Or is it a constitutional malady of long standing , which will yield only to extremely drastic measures ? Most city men , we believe , incline to the former view . The " prosperous American farmer " is an authen ? ticated figure in their political mythology . He has always grumbled , to be sure , but what is grumbling but the American substitute for the Old World practice of singing at one 's work ? Health , peace of mind and abundance dwell in the country , the city man believes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease itself off . Then the farmers will return with grateful docility to the Grand Old Party or to the creed of Thomas Jefforson . Just where do the farmers stand today , econ ? omically ? They have gathered crops this year worth the colossal sum of seven and one half bib lions of good American gold . Nor is that the limit of their income . Much of this value consists of corn , oats , hay , cotton seed and root crops which will be fed to live stock , at a profit , unless the farmer has taken to raising animals for the fun of it . We may safely estimate that three billions and a quarter of the crop value will be fed to animals , and we may estimate , not quite so safely , that the animal products sold will amount to three billion and a half , leaving a profit of a quarter of a billion to add to the seven and a half of crop values . Roughly speaking , seven and three quarters billions will cover the cash receipts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the latest exactions of his landlord , would be disposed to add also the rental value of 6,500,000 farm houses . But the National Bureau of Economic Research , in its latest study of income , makes the sensible point that on the average farm the upkeep of buildings and fences is at least a full offset for house rent . We need not go beyond the figure of seven and three quarters billions . From that sum must be deducted the wages of hired labor . This amounted to three quarters of a billion in 1916 , the year most nearly comparable to 1922 in gross product . Wages are higher now and must have taken at least a billion dollars . The cost of implements , automobiles , fertilizers and seed must have amounted to a billion and a quarter . Thus we come down to five billions and a half 25 the aggregate income of 6 , soo , 000 farmers , of about $850 per farmer ? or rather , per farm family . For we should not forget that the whole family , husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . We may , if we choose , com ? pare this figure with the average compensation of railway employees in 1917 of $1,072 ; with the average of $973 in the construction industry ; $945 in the hand trades ; $1,022 in the factory Indus " tries and $1 , o25 in mines , quarries and oil wells . Our authority for these figures is again the Na ? tional Bureau of Economic Research . We have taken 1917 as the year nearest the wages condi " tions of today . A farmer 's family earns decidedly less , it would , appear , than the average individual worker in in ' industry , transportation or mining . But this does not give at all a fair view of the disabilities under which the farmer labors . We ought to deduct something from his earnings for the depreciation of land . There is no large section of the country in which a considerable proportion ? probablY a majority ? of the farms is not running down phYs ' ically . More fertility is being mined out than 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this item . But there is another item which " . is more easily calculated . Farm land and build . " ings represent a capital which may be put conserva " tively at sixty-five billions , or ten thousand dollars per farm . As in any other business , interest ought : to be deducted if we wish to find the return to labor and enterprise . At the moderate rate of five percent this would amount to five hundred dollars for the average farm . Subtract this from the average income of $850 , and we have left $350 . For that sum the head of the family rises early and works late ; the wife milks cows and toils over the dairy utensils ; the children take care of the poultry and weed the garden . Certainly , we have had the year 's service of our agricultural workers very cheap . But 1922 has been a year of agricultural depres ? sion , surpassed in maleficence only by 1921 . Let us go back to the better years preceding . The Na ? tional Bureau of Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enterprise for the twelve years 1909 to 1920 . There were no exceptionally bad years in that period and two ex ? tremely good years , 1918 and 1919 . Well , through the entire period , the average farm labor income , calculated on about the same basis as we have used , was $636 . Still , the optimist will say , the farmer enjoyed security . He enjoyed virtue . He enjoyed the calm of the great open spaces . Besides he got his un ? earned increment . For is it not true that all lands are advancing in value , year by year ? No , that is not true at all . A great deal of land Is going down in value , or , if held at a constant value , is absolutely unsalable . Consider : A man , his wife and children , owning an average farm free of all encumbrance , earn less than the man alone , ' owning nothing , would earn in the city . How much Is the farm really worth ? A competent western economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agricultural problem until we recognize that the total value of our farm property Is not sixty-five billion dollars , but zero . There is something in the view . If labor has a first claim ? n production , the farmer 's labor can rightfully Claim the whole value product of the , soil , leaving not a red cent to sustain the value of property . We offer the farmer his choice . He may have a fair return on the property he has bought and slaved to improve and clear of mortgage , or he may have wages . Not , to be sure , a living wage , but the sort of wage the captains of industry grant to the city proletariat . The farmer ca n't have both ' Wages and returns on his property . He has n't had both at any time in the last fourteen years except in 19t8 and 1919 . He is n't likely to have both again for many years to come , if the matter is left to the healing virtue of time . That is the farmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be said that the cards have always been stacked against the farmer . In all ages he has had to pit his wits , trained in the mak ? ing of things , against the wits of the townsman , trained in the making of prices . Inevitably he has been skinned . There is nothing new in the present situation . But the farmer does not stand it so stoically as he used to . It used to be that the farmer was chained by the leg to his acres . It was hard to get away from the farmstead , and it was hard for a man fresh from the farm to find a job in the city . But two great avenues of escape have been opened in the last two generations , first the railway , with its insatiate demand for men strong in sinew and of clear sight , and brain , and latterly the auto ? mobile , practically a free course in mechanics and mobility for every wide-awake farm boy . Emi ? gration from the farm is going on in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations , say the optimists . There are too many farmers . If enough quit , the rest will make a living . But wait . This industry which we propose to leave to blind chance happens to provide the food supply of the peoples . And if chance does n't work out the way we assume , somebody may have to go hungry , as in India , China , Russia . Take the wheat crop of the world . The Inter ? national Institute of Agriculture estimates it at 2,932,000,000 bushels for the year . Practically all of that vast volume is human food . Divide the number of bushels by five , and the quotient is the number of people living through the year by the virtue of wheat , most of whom would not live at all if the wheat supply failed . As Germany , Italy , Austria , Poland and Russia are going to eat as little as they can , it appears that the year will af ? ford a surplus of 27,000,000 bushels , or nearly one percent . Obviously , no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hunger . The food supply , we submit , and the industry which produces it are not fit subjects for the rule , of blind chance . Grant that chance worked well through the century of territorial expansions , in which one zone of virgin lands after another was mined for its pristine fertility . The virgin lands are gone and the mouths have multiplied enor ? mously . The time is at hand when only a sound public policy will stand between the peoples and starvation . Such a policy will recognize that there must be a fair balance between agriculture and other econ ? omic activities . Farming must pay , on the whole , as well as anything else . Either farm prices will have to be evened up , or other prices will have to be evened down . That , says the captain of indus ? try , is proof that we must deflate labor . No ; it is proof that we must deflate the whole industrial and commercial superstructure , especially the capi ? talist and the profiteer . The farmer is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting any ? thing on his $65,000,000,000 investment . Let the railways , banks , flouring mills , mines , steel works , oil refineries accept the same terms and the farmer will stop grumbling for a time . But the capitalists will never accept such terms . Their investment is sacred . They have safeguard ? ed the income on it by law , by trade agree ? ments , by financial organization . The last twenty years have witnessed a veritable industrial revolu ? tion in the form of the development of a network of associations to insure the stability and profits of commerce and industry . That network , more than anything else , accounts for the fact that com ? merce and industry came nowhere near the degree of deflation that fell upon agriculture . Even to ? day , after three years of readjustment , what the farmer sells is anywhere from twenty to fifty per ? cent nearer prewar prices than what he buys . And prewar prices themselves were notoriously unfair to him . Industry and commerce are not going to deflate themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have or can make deflate them . The consumers ' cooperative movement may do it in time , but we can not wait on time . Accordingly there is just one way out , and that is to put agri ? cultural prices up . If the reader is an idolator of " natural econ ? omic law " he will hold up his hands in horror . Put prices up ? It 's against nature . Just the same , it can be done by Judge Gary to advance the inter ? ests of the steel stockholders . It could be done to preserve the interests of the nation . And the farmer is doing it , wherever he can . Through the new producers ' cooperative organiza ? tions he has put up the price of raisins to a living level . He has put up the price of a host of other special orchard and garden productions . He has put up the price of Burley tobacco . But the fate of the farmers , as a class , is bound up with the great staples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live stock industry . So also is the fate of the nation . Now , in spite of brave ' attempts , cooper ? ative marketing has not come anywhere near a position sufficiently commanding to affect these staples . And in view of the magnitude of their production and of their dependence on the world market there is little hope that producers ' cooper ? ation will ever control them adequately . What then ? Shall we content ourselves with a patch of plaster here , a bit of salve there ; raising the limit on farm loans to $2 , s , 000 for the benefit of the rare farmer who needs so much borrowed money ; creating production credit paper of one year or two or three ? Or shall we really grapple with the problem ? If the latter is what we pro ? pose to do we shall have to make up our minds to face the cost , a cost which may involve public money , but chiefly would involve the scrapping ' of cherished politico-economic ideas . We shall have to face the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the cost would be overwhelming , it will be said . Not necessarily . Take wheat , for example . Let us suppose that the price which would fairly redress the balance between wheat production and industry is a dollar and a half a bushel . A govern ? ment agency stands ready to buy all the wheat of ? fered at less than that price . There can be no doubt what would happen to the price . A dollar and a half would stand as a minimum . But how much wheat would go into elevators on government ac ? count ? The world surplus this year is 27,00000 ? bushels . Conceivably 50,000,000 bushels would have to be impounded . The government might be out a million and a half in interest . That is stag ? gering to contemplate ! But think what might happen later . Wheat pro ? duction might expand , and we might pile up a hurl " dred million bushels , two hundred , five hundred . If we got up to five hundred million bushels we should be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a position into which every civil ? ized nation would make haste to put itself , if go ' ernments were constituted to protect the peoples against the really vital risk , the risk of famine .
