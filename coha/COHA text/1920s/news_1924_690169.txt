txt The Legislature approved the prison reorganization plan urged by Governor SMITH in his annual message .. In signing the bill he said that it is the most progressive step in prison legislation ever taken in this State . It comes as a result of the exhaustive study and labor of a Prison Survey domrnittee , of which ADOLPH LawISOHN was Chairman , appointed by Governor SMITH back in 1919 . Mr. LswisonN personally met the expense of this inquiry . The outstanding feature of the new law is that it provides for a modern industrial system in prisons under as competent a Superintendent as private Industries demand . The prisoners are to be paid a reasonable wage , based upon what they actually Co , and their parole is to be determined in some degree by their work record . This is beginning again where a beginning ' was made on a smaller scale just a hundred years ago and where , some time later , for want of the employment of sound industrial methods and because of hampering laws , the experiment left off . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the specific recommendations of a Warden of the Tombs , made just fifty years ago : Let the prisoner share in his earnings , and let the percentage of his earnings increase at every stage of advance ; make the rules of conduct so stringent that it will cost great effort to gain all the credit marks . Introduce many of the most useful trades , let the prisoner have his choice to learn ; take time to eradicate all bad . habits . The provisions of the act which Governer SMITH signed last week make It Possible to ? offer an incentive to each prisoner to work hard and to conduct himself properly so that he may be the earlier paroled . Beyond this is the acquisition of some honest means of support when he does go out . That the act carries with it the burden of two unnecessary officials , kept for partisan reasons , does not detract from ? its chief merit . Governor SMITH deserves great credit for this achievement , but the public should remember ' that it would not have been possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by a public-spirited private citizen .
