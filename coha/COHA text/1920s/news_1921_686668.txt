txt Revenues of PullmatrrO : ? from its ca line operations , have been greatly reduced since the plicatton for a SO% surcharge which goes to the railroads , according to testimony of Ls S. Taylor , vice  --  president , at a hearing Friday before the chief examiner of the Interstate Commerce Commission on the complaint of the commercial travelers ' organization , attacking the 20% increase in Pullman fares made May 1 last year . Until September , when the surcharge was applied , Mr. Taylor said , the revenues reflected the 20% increase , but in February the increase was wiped out , and in April the revenues were 7.53% less than in April , 1920 , in spite of the 20% increase in the rate .. Number of berth and seat passengers was 782,902 , or 24.26% less . Mr. Tailor also described the company 's claim against the Railroad Administration for $24,500,000 , of which $7,250 , - 000 is for undermaintenance . The Administration had paid $7,000,000 on account , and is prepared to begin negotions for a settlement about September 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not cover the high %cost of repairs in 1920 and 1921 . Mr. Taylor said that it was confined to the perik , of federal control , whereas the company had spent $21 , - 000,000 ? for maintenance in 1920 and . this had overhauled only one-third of the cars . Asked how the $7,000,000 would be used , Mr , Taylor said that it had been spent for wages and materials and had reduced by that much the company 's resources . He said there is very little chance of the company 's getting the full amount of its claim because the railroads that have settled thus far have received less than 50 cents on the dollar . Mr. Taylor filed exhibits giving the revenues , expenses , payroll and costs of materials and supplies of the company for the past year as compared with previous periods . lie said the average compensation of the employes had been increased during the year from $1,406 a year to $1,484 . The car earnings , Mr. Taylor said , had been steadily decreasing since the application of the surcharge until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in April , 1920 . There was an increase in the revenues from May 1 , 1920 , to August , representing approximately the 20% increase in fares , but after the surcharge was applied there was a steady decline both in the number of passengers carried and in the revenues until in February the gain in revenue derived from the increase in fares was entirely wiped out . " We do not claim , " he said , " that this was due entirely to the surcharge , but the application of the surcharge was a serious blow to the Pullman Company 's revenues and it is a serious question whether the railroads have gained by it . Our thought is that they have lost in passenger revenues . " The opposing sides were allowed until August 15 to file briefs in the case .
