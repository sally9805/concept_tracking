Back in the dull , depressed days of 1921 President Warren Gamaliel Harding appointed a committee to look into the matter of unemployment , to make a report upon this then burning question . When last week the Unemployment Committee announced its findings , neither President Harding nor unemployment remained a U. S. problem . It was primarily a Hoover Committee that made the report ( President Hoover was Committee Chairman while Secretary of Commerce ) and prosperity , not unemployment , was the burden of its story . Called upon to view with alarm , the Committee concluded by pointing with pride . <P> " 1929 and All 's Well " was , indeed , almost the gist of the lengthy report . Exceptions were admitted in the cases of the coal , cotton , and " grain growing " industries , and in the New England States . <P> Stock market absorption of credit was regarded with misgiving . But the keynote , ringingly struck , was that there is no limit to the capacity of the U. S. consumer to consume , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U. S. production to supply material for consumption . Thus was observed a non-vicious circle in which the manufacturer constantly produced more merchandise , the consumer constantly consumed more merchandise , and out of the horn of plenty came gifts for one and all . <P> This general conclusion was based upon the following specific points : <P> Wages , Prices . The cost of living has slowly declined since 1922 , wholesale prices having fallen an average of 1/10 of 1% each year . While prices were being kept relatively stable , wages increased , so that the purchasing power of wages rose 2.1% a year . So , while prices are slightly lower than in 1922 , purchasing power of wages is almost 15% greater , thus making the wage-earner 's pay-envelope extend comfortably beyond the bare necessities of life . The committee complimented U. S. industry upon its wisdom in realizing that its profits could best be based , not on an attempt to go back to pre-War wages or to maintain inflation prices , but upon increasing consumption through a policy of " low costs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary production has increased about 17% , manufacturing and transportation about 28% . Greatest increase has come in per capita production , which increased 35% between 1922 and 1925 . Consumption , however , has had little difficulty in keeping pace with production . <P> " An almost insatiable appetite for goods and services " was termed a " striking characteristic " of the 1922-29 period . <P> Optional Consumption . Furthermore , much of recent consumption has been " optional " -i . e. , has consisted of purchases made from choice rather than necessity . <P> In addition to Optional Consumption , the committee ( seemingly bent on creating phrases ) also discussed Leisure Consumption-the fact that shorter hours of employment produce longer hours of leisure and that less work and more play make Jack a good spender . The busy radio and cinema industries were cited as examples of Optional Consumers engaged in Leisure Consumption .
