The simple , tragic tale of a rat named Grip , who could not make up his mind , was a piece of red hot news last week . William Cabell Greet , professor of Phonetics and the History of English at Barnard College , Columbia University , assembled seven men from scattered parts of the U.S. to tell the tale of Grip to wax discs in a recording studio of the Victor Talking Machine Co . The idea : to preserve for posterity accurate specimens of U. S. dialects . <P> Normal in every respect were the spoken words of a man from St. Louis , Mo . He sounded exactly like this : " Once there was a young rat who could n't make up his mind . Whenever another rat asked him if he would like to go out with him , he would answer , ' I do n't know . ' " <P> Samuel Stoney , Manhattan architect , native of Charleston , S. C. , gave an accurate imitation of Gullah ( early Negro ) dialect : " Once deh bin ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenebber duh turrah rat ax um ef e would like tuh come oudt widdum , e would muk ansuh , ' I du n no . ' " <P> Gullah contains many strange idioms and words such as buckra ( meaning white man or devil ) . According to Dr. Greet , Gullah and the language of Cape Cod are the only genuine dialects within the U. S. <P> Conspicuous among the U. S. inhabitants who appeared and spoke in their accustomed accents at the recording studio was the Vermonter with his kued for could , his enser for answer , his cahft for coughed . Also conspicuous was the Middle Ohioan with his doan for do n't , his then for than . <P> The words , horse and laugh , suffered the following variations : <P> Man from Maine : harrse , larf . Bostonian : hoss , lough . Texan : hawse , lawf . <P> The results , in the form of phonograph records , will be put on sale in September at $1 each . Dr. Greet expects to make 14 records by December , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pure Philadelphian . Eventually , he hopes to make 50 records .
