Figures are quoted con and hopes are advanced pro on the barnacle-bottomed question of whether or not the Government should stay in the shipping business and continue in that ( so far ) ineffective way to try to build up the U. S. merchant marine . Last week the question remained as derelict as ever , but the U. S. Shipping Board took a definite step which apparently vexed no one very much . It sold the U. S. entirely out of the shipping business on the Pacific Coast . <P> Of the 500 or so transoceanic merchantmen owned in the U. S. , three-fifths are owned by the Government . But only 39 were on the Pacific Coast . These the Shipping Board sold for $3,743,661 in three groups : <P> 1 ) The 21 ships of the American Australia Orient Line , plying between San Francisco and Los Angeles and ports in Australia , New Zealand , the Philippines , China , Japan-sold to a joint subsidiary of the Matson Navigation Co. and the American Hawaiian Steamship Co . <P> 2 ) The eleven ships of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Japan-sold to a corporation headed by Vice President K. D. Dawson of the Columbia Pacific Shipping Co . <P> 3 ) The seven cargo vessels of the American Oriental Mail Line , which famed Robert Dollar has been operating for the U. S. as lessee-sold to the Tacoma Oriental Steamship Co . <P> All the sales were on a basis of 2% cash down , 2 2% when the ships are transferred , the balance in seven and one-half years with interest at 4% , with guarantees by the buyers to operate the ships for at least five years .
