txt Mr. Tex Rickard is earnestly seek ing a prize lighter with . a good left hand punch to the head because Jack Dempsey told him not long ago that the only one who will be able to beat Tunney is some one who can maim tain a harassing program with a left hand In the region of the face . Left Lead Worries Tunney . Dempsey demonstrated a theory that this sort of punch , although it would knot knock Tunney down or weaken I him much , certainly would constitute ; a menace to his attractive profile and I therefore would ' keep Tunney 's right I hand constantly a-flutter parrying the leads . Going further , he developed the idea that Tunney 's right hand is the one he uses for punishing purposes , and finally he arrived at the conclusion that a left lead , constantly maintained , would preoccupy Gene 's only offensive weapon and , to state the matter bluntly , lick him . In this there would seem to be an implied admission on Mr. Dempsey 's part that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left band is not a fancy affair , but Just a punching hand . It would seem to imply also that Mr. Dempsey assumes everything would be strictly honest , which would be a naive assumption for one of Mr. Dempsey 's experience . However , Mr. Rickard is looking for somebody with a left hand of the sort seen Sharkey use this left on Jimmy Maloney 's chin to prepare him for the right cross to the chin which knocked him out , and he had even seen Sharkey prod Dempsey himself square on his beeswax nose with the left in the first couple of rounds at the Yankee stadium last slimmer . So naturally Mr. Rickard 's best wishes were with Sharkey 's left hand in the bout with Heeney , and naturally he was severely disappointed tro see Sharkey try a few pokes at Heeney 's face , miss most of them , and then abaridon this sort of work almost entirely to drive the left into ileeney 's body . It is a very hard , sharp penetrating left to the body , and the arm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heeney was trying with all his robust strength to hold it clamped . But Mr. Rickard realizes that left hooks to the body do not bring the customers up shouting , and ho knows that if this left hook of Sharkey 's could n't stop or even discourage Tom Heeney it would n't amount to much In the advertising matter for a champion . ship prize fight with Tunney . Jack Trains Only Three Days . So the business prospects Just now are not so good but that they might be several hundred per cent better . On Sharkey's- behalf it was explained that ho trained but three days for the prize fight with Heeney , and the koft roll of slack flesh that hung over the rim of his belt testified for this alibi . But this only goes to show how little the heavyweight prize fighters have to give for what they get . Sharkey and . Heeney were fighting for generous shares of $161,000 , and Mr. Sharkey , but a few years removed from toil at piece work wages at the work bench In a shoe factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earning his money by engaging in three days of mild calisthenics , a few round of mug.thumping in the practice ring , and 36 minutes of rough work , . relieved by thirty or forty clinches of from five to ten seconds each .
