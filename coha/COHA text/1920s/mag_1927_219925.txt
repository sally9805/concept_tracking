The traditionally quiet atmosphere of international chess had been disturbed . One M. L. Lederer had accused Dr. Emanuel Lasker , German chess master , onetime world 's champion , of employing unfair tactics for the purpose of impairing his opponents ' powers to cerebrate . Specifically , Mr. Lederer had charged Dr. Lasker with 1 ) smoking cigars of semi-lethal composition during his matches , 2 ) exhaling fumes of same at strategic intervals and with unnecessary force , * 3 ) shouting superfluous orders at attendants , 4 ) being a nuisance intentionally . <P> Last week Dr. Lasker 's reply , posted from Trondjhem , Norway , was published in the New York Times . With Teutonic thoroughness he denied Mr. Lederer 's accusations , excoriated his critic generally . <P> " If , " wrote the doctor , in effect , " my cigars are terrible and I blow the smoke in my opponent 's face , why do my opponents never object at the time of blowing ? Furthermore , if my cigars were of inferior quality , they would destroy the subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen me play and watched the smoke curve will bear witness that it curves away from rather than toward my opponent . " He went on : <P> " Mr. Lederer describes me as being a man of exceedingly bad manners who screams for the attendant and orders him to do this or that . I may be pardoned for mentioning that I have servants . . . who have been with me for a long time . And therefore it may be inferred that I treat them and others with consideration . " <P> Following this categorical denial , Dr. Lasker struck back with a sensational countercharge . He asserted that on his last appearance in this country evil hands had tampered with the chess-clock , a two-faced affair intended for impartial allotment of thinking-time to the combatants . The clock , wrote Dr. Lasker , used in his match with Jos Capablanca , present world 's champion , had unquestionably been " jimmied . " Capablanca had received therefrom long , comfortable contemplation-periods ; he ( Lasker ) had been rushed into illadvised , catastrophical decisions . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer was published while six international mentalities were vying in the annual chess masters ' tournament in Manhattan . Jos Capablanca , was in the lead as was his custom , until he tied with Aron Nimzowitch of Copenhagen . <P> *Walter J. Travis , onetime champion golfer , was in the habit of smoking long , slender , virulent stogies during his matches . The ventilation of these stogies , it was said , became especially active on the putting green . It was darkly hinted that the stogies lent Mr. Travis strength while temporarily discomfiting his rival .
