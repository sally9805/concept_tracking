CRUSADE-Donn Byrne-Little Brown ( $2 ) . There is almost no getting around it , and Donn Byrnians will have to survive it as best they can-their favorite author has rewritten The Sheik with reverse English . Perhaps , though , the reverse is Irish enough to keep the faithful in the fold . <P> Returning to Palestine for a sentimental journey after the pseudo-austerities of his pilgrimage in Brother Saul , Author Byrne tells the tale of Miles O'Neill , a young Irish knight seeking fortune after being dispossessed at home . Palestine is technically at peace , between crusades . The saviors and guardians of the Lord 's Sepulchre have nothing better to do than gamble extravagantly , dawdle quarrelsomely and bicker about Doctrine . <P> O'Neill joins a raid in which Bethlehem is snatched from its Saracen overlord . Returning in force , the Saracen prevails , but not until O'Neill has , with his bare hands , slain one of their champions . For this feat his life is spared by Kothra , the sheikess of the piece . First as prisoner , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , young O'Neill is torn between ancestral pride and desert love ; also between his inherited Christianity , which the crusaders ' irreligion spoils for him , and Islam , which his courteous captor-hosts gently urge . <P> After a thoroughly thrilling set-to with the Knights Templars , who are painted as Black-Mass men and whose assassins invariably go disguised as leprous beggars , O'Neill and Kothra hump themselves furiously on dromedary-back to the marge of the Lake of Galilee . The bloodhounds are coming ! Quick , quick ! Will he embrace Islam to save them both ? Yes , yes ! So , discreetly , they strip off their clothes and swim together out of the last chapter , presumably to board a Bedouin fishing smack , get back to Damascus and live in flower-fragrant happiness ever after .
