txt There are great opportunities for the Community Trust which opened its headquarters at 120 Broadway last ' week . Its organization was first pro-1 Posed three years ago , and in April , of the current year RALPH HAyEs was named director and plans for effective work were laid . Sucb are the diversities of charitable interests in New York . and so many the sources of philanthropic bequests , that it has not been easy heretofore to put into practice the centralizing principle of supervision which is at the basis of the community fund idea New York has never had a full measure of the community spirit . It has been divided into too many lesser cities , each of which has been too fluid to encourage effective co. - operation in charitable work . Too often there has been rivalry instead of joint action , with resultant loss of efficiency . This has been particularly true in the case of small sums left by person , s of moderate wealth to charities of limited purposes . Frequently they have been left to obsolescent institutions , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In England during the last three or four centuries more than 40,000 trusts were created for charitable purposes , nearly all of which have become obsolete because the objects which the donors bad in mind no longer have any social value . One of these bequests , for example , provided a fund for redeeming captives from pirates . Here in New York the Community Trust will co-operate with the trust companies and banks . Gifts made for any purpose , whether during the lifetime of an individual or in a will , can be turned over to a trust company which will become responsible for their safekeeping So long as possible , the specified purposes of these bequests will be carried out . The Community Trust may exercise supervision over the disbursement of these funds , and , in particular , if ? no specific purpose be named . may see to It - that they are distributed to the best interests of the community . One of the principal services of the Community Trust will be in insuring that money given for purposes which later lose their value may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been granted especial powers to devote such funds to objects as nearly In line with the spirit of the gifts as possible , and thus to perpetuate the wishes of the donor in spite of changed conditions . In this way much waste can be avoided . Upon the success of the Community Trust will depend in a measure the prospects of a still further extension of the co-operative movement in the administration of welfare work . The so-called " community chests " have been found to work well In smaller cities in handling annual contributions , for charitable purposes . The control exercised by those who administer the , funds from these " chests " has done much to eliminate the high costs of " drives " and unnecessary costs growing out of overlapping interests . Whether this system can be effective in a place as large as New York is still an open question . The city , however , is sorely in need of closer coordination of its various welfare organizations .                 @ @ @ @
