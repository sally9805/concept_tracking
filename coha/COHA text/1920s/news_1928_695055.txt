Leadership switched from the airplane stocks into others , and American Telephone , American International . General Motors , and Ludlum Steel were outstanding features . Action of these stocks caused a return or confidence to pools which had stepped aside on Wednesday and brought a resumption of bullish operations in many directions . Commission houses were preaching caution at the opening of the market and advised customers to take profits on part of their long holdings on any rally . While this advice was followed in the second hour it was reported that many of the early sellers returned to the market as buyers during the substantial recoveries in the latter part of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wednesday 's decline was referred to as indicating what can happen when the market 's technical position becomes weakened by excesses on the long side .

In the past such information has been responsible for the advances of 2 or more points which were recorded in many stocks in the initial dealings , because it was easy to bring a buying following into the market . Conservative observers have attempted to keep customers from following this information in the past but their efforts have met with little success while the enthusiasm was running high . Correction Necessary Point was made in most quarters that a correction of the market 's internal position was necessary and came about at a time when an into , ruption to optimism would be beneficial to stocks in the long run .

Public Liquidation Considerable public liquidation has come into the market . This was not forced , but was the result of stop orders which have been recommended for weeks by the reading commission houses as a protection against margined accounts . When stops are executed during a declining market they aid materially in getting prices to lower levels . Support Points A tendency is noted to select prices at which the first support should be encountered in the standard stocks . In connection with this it is evident that most firms are inclined to advise customers against taking a long position in the highly speculative specialties , despite sharp reactions which might come in such issues . Scale buying is being recommended from these levels in the high grade stocks , but clients are being urged to purchase smaller amounts than they have been accustomed to carrying , so they will be in a position to average if further weakness develops .
