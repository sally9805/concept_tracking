The Press , ever watchful for the dramatic , for the pathetic , for the emotional , failed signally to capture the main dramatic theme of the Democratic Convention . It was a nominating Convention , and blindly the Press sought drama in the nomination , a hero in the nominee . Shakespeare , a greater dramatist , knew well that , in the tragedy of Caesar , Brutus was the moving character . <P> Who knows the exact date , the exact hour , the exact place where the three Scotch witches first ensnared their victim : " Treasury thou art , Railroads shalt be ; More hereafter ! " . . . <P> William G. McAdoo listened and was snared . That event was not recent . It was several years ago . He married the daughter of a President , and in his heart he said : " Someday I , too , shall hold this post . " It was the greatest goal that he could strive for , and he set his heart upon it . <P> The public does not know - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations he laid , some long ago , some recently . It is not known what endless effort he invested , what sums of money - his own and other people 's . The Doheny retainers which cost him so much politically - who knows but they were all sunk in the great dbacle ? Certain it is that almost half the strength of the Democratic Party was not assembled under one banner with out herculean effort , without a well-furnished purse . <P> All this was done by one man , single in purpose . As time went on , he felt himself to be within reach of the nomination . He felt the Democratic Party to be within reach of the Presidency . He staked his all on the great throw . He considered nothing , but the ways and means of success . He dedicated himself at the altar of his hope . <P> Somehow he built a National organization , somehow supplied it with funds and courage . A great part of the country never appreciated his spirit . The North-East , especially , looked upon him as another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenious scheming had made him something to be reckoned with . The hell-bent determination which carried his organization through the crisis when it was disclosed that he was a Doheny lawyer , highly-paid-the spirit which succeeded in weathering that storm-was indeed something to be reckoned with . <P> Many of the McAdoo delegates understood that spirit . It was something near insanity or genius . It was only such a spirit that could hold 400 or 500 delegates bound firmly to a lost cause through eight sweltering days , through 100 torturing ballots . The wiseacre bosses of the North-well used to politics , with no illusions about the cynical , practical kind of a Game it is-after the second day of balloting shook their heads and said : " Well , it 's a stubborn crowd . We wo n't nominate until shortly after the 50th ballot . " <P> To McAdoo , literally , it did not occur that he might quit . These years of work , these endless efforts , promises , pledges , payments , worries , what not-all had been endured . It was ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang on . Across the whole country he had cut a wide swath of victory . In time , he would mow the rest .
