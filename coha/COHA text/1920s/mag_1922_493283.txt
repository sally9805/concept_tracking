A New Constitution for Illinois 0 N December 12th the people of Illinois will vote on a new constitution ; whether they will vote it up or down is a question which is asked in Chicago with more curiosity than excitement . As usual , the opponents are more vociferous than the friends , and the attacks come from many quarters ; were the contest to be decided by the City alone , the outlook might be considered dark ( the city council . has just voted so to 6 against the constitution ) ; but with all down-state to be heard from , the issue hangs in the balance . The present constitution dates from 1870 and is by no means an altogether antiquated instrument ; but some of its clauses , chiefly because they WPre too rigidly drawn , needed amendment badly ' , and the amending process was so difficult that various attempts at amendment had failed . So , the people voted for a revision and elected a ei ? r ? Vention . The convention was . a relatively : gh grade body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent in business ; a body of slightly lower grade might have been more re- , presentative , and perhaps in some respects politically wiser . The delegates labored faithfully and certainly labored long , sitting intermittently for nearly three years ; and the instrument which they finally produced represents a very fair type of a conservative constitution , seeking honest solutions of difficult problems , and improving the present basic law in a number of important particulars . Great economic issues were conspicuous by their absence ; labor was little discussed , railroads ( which overshadowed the convention of 1869- 70 ) hardly at all ; the main problems where political , administrative and financial . One of the political issues has left no trace in the completed instrument : initiative and referendum were rejected . An optional . referendum might not have been considered objectionable ; but " I. &; R. " seem to go together like Siamese twins , and the convention did not like the Initiative . From the point of view of good government , it is easy to share the dislike ; but a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting it is a factor that counts against the constitution . The most bitterly contested issue was that of representation in the General Assembly . " Down state " feared that with the continuing growth of Chicago the city in a decade or two might come to dominate the state . As a matter of political principle a good deal can be said for an arrangement which will prevent a great metropolitan community from getting control of all the branches of government . Acres and square miles as well as human individuals go to make up the state , and the background of the land should be an element in the reaching of political decisions . The argument gains in strength if it does not involve a surrender of the majority to the minority . The two chamber system naturally lends itself to compromise , a compromise still favorable to the numerical principle , since the governor is elected on a pure population basis . In the American states the senate is generally constituted at least to some extent upon a territorial basis ; and in a number of states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time the down state members stood out for a limitation in both houses , the Chicago and Cook County members for no limitation in either . This was natural , but it led nowhere ; repeatedly it looked as though the convention would break upon the question , and its protracted dination was largely due to this difficulty . A , compromise was finally reached , whereby the House was to continue on a population basis , while in the Senate Cook County ( including Chicago ) is to be limited to 19 out of 57 members . It was either this or the abandonment of the entire Revision . The situation was further affected by the fact that with a continuance of the present constitution Chicago can not get its quota of representatives ; for both in 1911 and in 1921 the legislature refused to reapportion the state , which would have forced a recognition of the city 's growth , and there is no power to compel action in 1931 . The new constitution provides for executive reapportionment upon failure of the general assembly to act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as minor points ; from a larger political , point of view this one does not even involve a sacrifice of principle ; but " robbing the people of Chicago of their birthright " is an effective campaign cry , and it will lose thousands of votes in the city . However , this may be offset by corresponding gains down state . Somewhat connected with the matter of representation is that of home rule , for the inability to control the legislature will be less significant if the city can manage its own affairs . Briefly stated , Chicago is given full self-government , subject , so far as powers are concerned , to statutory prohibitions applying to the entire state , but in the matter of organization with liberty to override state laws , and to consolidate the various taxing bodies now competing with the city . The right of the city to own and operate public utilities is recognized , and with regard to water and transportation it is made effective by the grant of an unlimited bonding power , subject to the obligation to operate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get was power to fix its own tax rate and debt limit , or power to control the rates of privately owned local utilities , i. e. im community from state commission regulation . These refusals were due to the conservatism of the city 's own delegates in the convention , and merely continue the traditional policy of the state , as well as of all other states . Financial independence may be logically a part of home rule , but it would be a new and precarious gift ; apart from it , the city gets all the home rule that can be granted without disintegrating the state government . But ' to many home rulers the only things that count are the things the city did not get , and this part of the constitution has failed to placate those who smart under the reduction of the representation . There are important changes in the organization of the judiciary . Their main political interest lies in the increase of the powers to the Supreme Court . That court will appoint all intermediate appellate judges ; it will control by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of Cook County ; it will appoint its own clerk ( noW elected ) , and it will have a rule-making power subject only to a qualified legislative veto . There is some question whether the exclusive rule making power will not greatly embarrass ordinary legislation ; but that is a technical matter . Labor fears that some judicial powers which it now ab ' hors may be strengthened and placed beyond popular control . It is also charged that the Supreme Court by its large powers over personnel will be enabled to build up a powerful machine , and that it will thereby be thrown inevitably into politics . If this latter apprehension is unfounded , the new constitution marks a great improvement in judical cirganization ; but the political impli ' cations can not be ignored , and they will have some weight at the election . The revenue article permits an income tax . It December 13 , 1922 is clumsily worked out , and not readily understood . The outstanding features are that the permissible exemptions are low , and that progression is limited so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest rate . Admirable from the lofty point of view of approximate equality of Public rights and public burdens , but a red rag to those who look upon our economic system as one of exploitatidn of the mass of the people by the rich . There is little doubt that the proposed provisions are too rigid , and if adopted they will Probably not stand for long without change . It Is difficult to say how any agreement could have been reached on any plan both definite and positive , and also satisfactory . The provisions should be compared with that we have : personal Property taxation in theory confiscatory , but in practice made relatively light by rough administrative equity and favor , a system Oriental in spirit  - -  but people seem to like it for that very reason . The revenue plank will not greatly help to carry the ship into port . There are a number of minor changes , which are made points of attack ; a slight alteration in the bail provision , which may be construed as reducing the constitutional guaranty ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation , permitting the Bible to be read in public schools withOut comment . It is quite obvious that in so far as these changes will affect votes at all , they will do so adversely . The whole situation illustrates the working of the constitutional referendum ; present to the peoPie a comprehensive and lengthy instrument , and even the intelligent citizen will consider it ' his sovereign prerogative to vote " . no " because this or that provision is distasteful to him . As one of r. hundred legislators he would know that there can he no law-making , without compromise , and Would act accordingly ; as one of a million he acts largely on prejudice : and impulse , and , at best , as it an honest impression was a sufficient warrant for an adverse vote . Perhaps the " fifty-lines " constitution , often urged as a counsel of perfection , ' , nay again become a counsel , of political wisdom . " r constitutional conventions will have to do what ( - ) hio and Massachuseetts did , submit separate Proposals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not as good as many , ? ' ? d people ( the writer being among them ) think they could have produced . But if any one wants a new constitution , the only valid reason for ' ? tillg against this one is the hope of getting something more radical drafted and carried in the ilcIt too distant future . ERNST FREUNP . Alter-vinner Autobiography The Print , of my Remembrance , by Augustus Thomas . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $4.00 . U NDER the charm of the friendly and clear and amiable and anecdotal I read straight to the end of iJr . Augustus Thomas ' near five hundred pages . We be- , gin with the boy in St. Louis , with rumors of the Civil War , with that , delightful grandmother , that fine , gentle father and his half practical , half visionary shrewdness ; we hear of the job on the railroads , the service in Washington as page to the Hall of Representatives , the return to St. Louis , to amateur theatricals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as years pass there come the adventures with road companies , the friends , the flights in authorship ; and then New York , and actors and managers , Maurice Barrymore , Julia Marlowe , Charles Frohman and a hundred others ; and the success of Arizona , the tri umphs of The Earl of Pawtucket with Mr. Lawrence D'Orsay in it . And finally we have chapters on travels , on life in Paris , on sources of inspiration , on The Witching Hour , and on influences , books and men . About the whole book there is first of all a kind of sanity , a certain well-aired and healthy view of life ? though life seen from the big end of the horn , from an assured success . The temperament revealed is balanced , intelligent and lovable . The natural affections appear simply and gently and often tenderly expressed . The memory for past fashions and movements is lively . The theatrical sidelights are both informing and diverting ; the record of by-gone days and once famous idols is rich with fading tradition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes all of a sudden the realization that I have been reading the autobiography of a worker in art . With this realization I have a rush of amazing instances out of the book . There were indeed hints of young dreams , dreams of being an author , an artist , a player . There are accounts of plays , how they originated , how they went off when the public had a chance at them . But so far as one can see , these were the droll high hopes , of a lad . These plays had no inner necessity for coming to life . There was no struggle and no darkness behind them . They had no urgeney , no fling of the spirit ; they are not dear to their creator , they are not his ' children . Plato wrote of the artist 's creations once . " And everyone , " he said , " who considers what posterity Homer and Hesiod , and the other great poets , have left behind them , the sources of their own immortal memory and renown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the guardians , not only of Lacedaemon but of all Greece ; or what an illustrious progeny of laws Solon has produced , and how many admirable achievements men have left ' aS pledges of that love which subsisted between them and the beautiful , would choose rather to be the parent of such children than those in a human shape . " Evidently Plato liked to hear himself talk . No , when the dramatic urge arises in one 's breast , what happens might be this ; you hear that Mamie Miles , who is a capital actress and whose wink became famous from coast to coast in the eighties , needs a play ; perhaps her man ager , impersonating the muse , conies to you . So you get a pot of coffee and shut yourself up in a hotel room and write the play . Or you get interested in the popular in terest in some question and you make a play out of it that the public wants . This play runs two years ; that is the way you describe the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
