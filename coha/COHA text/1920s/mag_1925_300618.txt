If one is to understand what happened in the Senate last week in regard to the disposal of Muscle Shoals , one has to arrange facts in a simplified manner . In the first place , there have been four chief proposals for the disposal of the Muscle Shoals property : <P> 1 ) The Ford plan , which provided to sell part and lease the rest of the Muscle Shoals property to Henry Ford . <P> 2 ) The Norris plan , which provided for Government operation . <P> 3 ) The Underwood plan , which instructed the President to lease the plant to private operators . <P> 4 ) The Jones plan , which created a commission to study the disposal of the property and report in a year . <P> Last session , the House passed 1 ) the Ford plan and sent it to the Senate . The Senate failed to act on the bill before it adjourned last June . Before Congress opened again , Mr. Ford withdrew his offer-so it was obvious that the bill had to be amended . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Norris plan . After a month 's debate , the Senate amended the bill again by substituting 3 ) the Underwood plan ( TIME , Jan. 19 ) . Last week , in the course of two days , the Senate proceeded to tie up the measure in knots as follows : <P> First , the bill was amended by substituting 4 ) the Jones plan for the Underwood plan . Second , it was amended by substituting 2 ) the Norris plan for the Jones plan . Third , it was amended by substituting 3 ) the Underwood plan for the Norris plan . Then an attempt was made again to amend the bill toy substituting 4 ) the Jones plan for the Underwood plan . This last attempt failed . Finally , the bill ( composed of 3 ) - the Underwood plan-was passed by vote of 50 to 30 . <P> Technically , the bill had now passed both Houses of Congress . But the Senate had made " amendments " . The usual course of procedure when amendments are made is to hold a joint conference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete change of the bill from 1 ) the Ford plan to 3 ) the Underwood plan . A compromise or a conference hardly seemed appropriate . <P> The House may recommit the bill to committee , in which case it is probable that no final action will be taken this session . At any rate it is a problem , with the fate of the bill depending on the decision of the House .
