Filipinos , protesting , have termed the administration of Governor-General Leonard Wood the " Cavalry Cabinet . " Smooth , alliterative , the phrase vividly suggests booted , spurred cavalrymen administering Island affairs to the accompaniment of clanking sabres . Such a picture , of course , overlooks the facts that the Filipinos have their own legislature and that a majority of Island administrative offices are held by natives . Still , the 1926 report of Carmi Thompson on the Islands did criticize the " military atmosphere " surrounding the administration , and the many U. S. Army uniforms around Malacanan Palace ( seat of the Philippine government ) have been no healing sight for sore Filipino eyes . <P> So , last week , Filipinos had an opportunity to cheer , to triumph .

However , they at least had grounds for hoping that the " Cavalry Cabinet " would soon be dismounted . <P> It was believed that the President would make his transfer suggestion officially to Congress at the next session ( December ) . <P> During Charles Evans Hughes ' term as Secretary of State there was a movement to take the Islands out of War Department jurisdiction and turn them over to the State Department . Secretary Hughes expressed no eagerness for the additional responsibility , and the idea was finally dropped .

The General arrived in Manhattan last week , stopped at the Waldorf-Astoria , continued to announce that he would be back in Manila by September . He said that President Coolidge was " a great President , " that the Filipinos were the " happiest people on earth " and that though most of them undoubtedly wanted independence , they really did not understand what independence would mean .
