txt The German war indemnity  --  only $21,000,000,000 plus interest  --  is trifling compared with the paper indebtedness . Germany is daily nutting forth . One might suspicion that Germany was issuing worthless paper and ' selling it all over the world for what she could get in return with the intention eventually to repu ' diate her currency . In fighting the indemnity payment to the allies by selfimposed bankruptcy and destructive paper issues , Germany in digging her own grave . Indeed , when considered from a commercial standpoint , it may be declared that Germany has receded by her own attempted bankruptcy a great deal faster after the war than during the war . English , French and Americans are buying property in Germany at ridiculous prices measured in gold and are able to hire German labor in connection with these properties at less than $2 a week and sometimes as low as $1 a week , when German marks are translated into gold values . How can Germany ever dig herself out from under her load of paper indebtedness when she has enslaved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned last month from Germany , says to a representative of Dow , Jones &; Co , : " At the Adlon in Berlin I found my room cost me only one quarter of what it did before the war . I paid 66 marks which cost me a dollar , while before the war I paid 16 marks or $4 . Railroad fare from ' the Belgian frontier to Berlin , 15 hours , cost me only $2.70 in American money . German bankers told me that the country was bankrupt ; that the government collected last year in taxes only six billion marks to cover a deficit of 36 billion , of which 18 billions marks was due to railway deficit ard 18 billion marks to deficit in the government budget . Therefore 30 billion ntaTks of paper had to issue . " When I wak there the hankers did not seem to F1'e any way of escape but to issue 30 billion marks per annum . Of course , this was before the German indemnity had been fixed by the Reparations Committee . " Everything in Europe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Nice to Paris , 21 hours . and from Vienna to the Swiss frontier , 20 hours , only $4 . " Switzerland can not manufacture and sell to the countries around her under existing rates of exchange . " Germany is in the hands of socialists and there seems to be nowhere any responsibility . " Mr. McClure 's statements are confirmed by travellers abroad and there are . preparations for quite an exodus from this country in the spring . months to take advantage of cheap living abroad , especially in France and Italy . Mr. McClure 's figures are correct for last year , but increased railroad rates arc to he put into operation and taxes will be increased . There must be soon outstanding 100 billion German paper marks . There were by last reports 66 billion marks Reichsbank notes and 11,500,000,000 marks war loan notes issued up to January 1 and there are ten billion marks issued by the states and local communities so that Germany must soon be reckoned with on a basis of having more than 100 billion marks outstanding . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indemnity , but the socialistic government of Germany itself through its issue of nearly worthless paper currency which enables the outside world to buy its property , its products and its labor at a fraction of their normal value to the outside world .
