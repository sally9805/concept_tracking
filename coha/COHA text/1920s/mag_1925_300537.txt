Of radical magazines there is no end . The barometers of influence , modes , cults and cliques , they succeed each other in gay , interminable succession-backed by a group of bright young people who want to see their names in print , or by a garretful of earnest intellectuals whose desire it is to break a lance for any forlorn cause and die if they can-or at least starve-on the barricade of some well fought for hope . The magazines are published in amazing covers of topaz and mauve and cinnamon . Braver than autumn leaves , they flourish for a while , bailiffs occupy the editorial rooms and grubby gentlemen attach the furniture , and the gay little magazines dry up and perish . <P> But last week came the announcement of a new radical magazine . It will be on the newsstands , said its editors , in about six weeks . When people saw the names of those editors , when they read the statement issued by its underwriters , they wondered if here , at last , was not the ultimate evergreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay . <P> The backers are the trustees of the American Fund for Public Service-that lump of money which was made into a trust fund by earnest young Charles Garland of Boston , who inherited $1,000,000 and refused to accept it because he was that rarest of idealists , a socialist who applied his precepts to himself . The fund has been nearly doubled by careful investments . Its custodians stated that they were ready to devote $17,000 a year " or more " to this publication , with the condition that the founders raise an additional $10,000 a year . And what will this magazine be called ? The New Masses , said the editors . And who are the editors ? Michael Gold , Joseph Freeman , James Rorty , Hugo Gellert and John Sloan , said the backers . And what will they write about ? This question the editors and backers answered in chorus in a flamboyant bulletin entitled : OUR THEMES . <P> It read : This is a new age , and a great age . This loud vast machine civilization contains greater materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the New Masses writers and artists are not going to run away from it . <P> The creative imagination of today has cast off the shackles of our timid middle-class culture . It sees and feels a new America-an America of steel and stone , of dynamos and blast furnaces . It sets itself to discover the new America that contains great corporations and great trade unions , New York skyscrapers , Chicago stockyards , Pittsburgh steel mills , Florida land-rushes . West Virginia strikes , Herrin massacres , Ku Klux Klans , Legions and Leagues , labor spies , tabloid newspapers , jazz , lynching , sports , mortgaged farms , farm trusts , romantic fiction magazines , movies , bunk morality , bunk religion , bunk politics , imperialistic adventures-the new America that all the rest of the world watches with mingled horror and admiration . <P> We are through forever with the picked chicken-bones and squeezed lemons of art ; with the moonlight and roses and the tiresome nudes that make up the world of the unoriginal esthetes .
