On one sultry August afternoon , the denizens of Mexico City were startled by the clatter of horses and the tramp , tramp , tramp of feet . With curious eyes , they watched detachments of police , armed with shining Mauser rifles , surround Congressional Hall . <P> Inside the building , there sat , as the Electoral Congress , the Permanent Commission and the Deputies unopposed at the last election ( TIME , July 21 ) . They were there to examine the credentials of the newly-elected Deputies . <P> The parade of armed force was necessary , according to the civil and military authorities , because of much high feeling between the adherents of President-elect Gen. P. Elias Calles and those of Gen. Angel Flores on the one hand ; between the Agrarians and Laborites , both supporters of Gen. Calles , on the other . <P> The Floristas admitted that they were beaten in the polling , but charged that the Callistas had broken ballot boxes and prevented them from voting . There was a possibility , it was said , that the Floristas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of calling upon President Obregon and upon the public for fair play in the matter of selections by the Electoral Congress . <P> The trouble between the Agrarians and the Laborites was that they were - both trying to put their own candidates into office , both claiming the honor of having made the election of Calles possible . This factionalism split the Callistas and gave rise to expectations of riotous demonstrations .
