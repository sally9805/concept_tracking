Since late November influenza has been increasing throughout western Europe at so alarming a rate that public health officials have come to fear a pandemic , a world-wide occurrence of this disease , such as happened in 1918-19 . Already Switzerland , Germany England and France have been severely hit . At Nantes , France , the undertakers reported last week that they were four days behind with their burials . Their crogue-morts* complained of sore feet and demanded subsidy for new shoes . In Italy the authorities claimed they have no epidemic . But no gloss was smeared over the situation in Spain , Ireland , Scotland , the Netherlands , Belgium , Greece , Norway , Sweden and Denmark . In Denmark King Christian and Queen Alexandrine were bedridden , and in Spain 200,000 politically less important people were afflicted. + <P> In the U. S. last week only 1,863 cases were reported by the U. S. Public Health Service . Said Assistant Surgeon General Claude Connor Pierce : " We have the influenza scare every year , and we find that it is present again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act against it , because the actual cause of influenza has never been determined . The advice we give anyone suffering from a cold or the grip at this time of the year is either to stay in bed , or at home , and not to circulate the germ . " <P> *Professional mourners who in frowsy dignity accompany the hearse . <P> +Epidemiologists insist that world-wide plagues of disease begin in Asia and then work towards Europe and the Americas . So the League of Nations has placed health watchers in the principal Asiatic coast cities to report by wireless the local health status . These reports are compiled and then relayed to worried , watchful Western officials . But this influenza spread caught the League unawares by starting , apparently , in Spain , just as did the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 . Last week the League relayed wireless health reports of European , as well as of Occidental countries .
