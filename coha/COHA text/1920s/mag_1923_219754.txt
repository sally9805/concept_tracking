To discover the focal point of literary life in Chicago , that literary center of the middle-west , some say , indeed , of America , is a difficult task . Perhaps it is at the White Paper Club , where one finds genial Emerson Hough , active , white-haired , forward-looking rather than given to reminiscing , planning a fishing trip with enthusiasm ! There is the office of Poetry , where sits the discoverer of many renowned American poets , Harriet Munroe , and where one may occasionally encounter Henry B. Fuller , one of the quietest and most significant figures in the progress of American letters . There is the University of Chicago , with its Robert Herrick , whose Homely Lilla brings him back to fiction after several years of silence . There is Evanston , with Keith Preston , the gay columnist and gayer Greek professor , with Henry Kitchell Webster and Edwin Balmer , both popular novelists . There is Schlogel 's , chiefly picturesque as a cafe by reason of pre-prohibition memories , where gather the denisons of The Chicago Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heywood Broun of Chicago ; Ben Hecht , who aims to shock ; and last , but oh ! not least , Carl Sandburg ! <P> For me , Carl Sandburg is the focal point of Chicago literary life . He breathes Chicago . He is Chicago . If you would understand that banging , sweeping city with its stockyards and its shining lakefront , read The Windy City . No poem , perhaps , ever epitomized a city so successfully . Sandburg is tall , stooping , quiet , his voice , hesitant and booming . To explore Chicago streets with Sandburg on a summer day is to learn the spirit of the town . <P> Sandburg 's parents were Swedish , yet somehow he has the warmth of southern countries in him , too . He was born in Galesburg , Ill . He was a soldier in the Spanish-American War . He has worked on railroads . He has washed dishes . He has been a political organizer and soap-box orator . He attended " Lombard College , " where he was editor-in-chief of the undergraduate paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love of people in the mass of crowds , of ugliness , of brutality . More than any other American poet , with his curious rythms sprung from Negro and Indian sources , with his slang and his brassy effects , he has , I believe , reached the heart of the American people . If you have never heard Sandburg sing folk songs of America , bending over his guitar , white locks down over his forehead , dreaming of hoboes by a fire under some abandoned freight car , you have missed an experience that is comparable to none that I know .
