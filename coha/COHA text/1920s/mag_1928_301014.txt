( See front cover ) <P> A Grecian blonde once made tall trouble and men have never forgotten . Long before Christ they knew her as the fairest of all women , the one the Trojan Paris stole , for whom the Greeks fought ten long years . Brave warriors died for Helen . Brave poets since have spent their dearest words on her . She has been Menelaus ' Helen , Paris ' Helen ; Homer 's Helen , too , and the Helen of Herodotus , Euripides , of Kit Marlowe , Alexander Pope , Andrew Lang . Recently John Erskine , perspicacious professor at Columbia University , won fame with his Helen refurbished . Last week and for the first time , still proud , still beautiful , she came to the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan-this time the Helen of Composer Richard Strauss , given new being by Singer Maria Jeritza . <P> The Story . Hugo von Hofmannsthal* did the text for Strauss ' Helen and laid the scene in Egypt . Helen and Menelaus are headed home . Troy has fallen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , and by the same curved sword Helen too must die as an atonement to the Greeks . A sorceress learned all this from Muschel , a psychic shell which reported in a bold contralto a vision of Menelaus stealing hugger-mugger into the ship 's hold , knife ready . Aithra , the sorceress , had strange powers . Just then she managed a mighty storm to stay the murderer 's hand . She blew their ship to bits , dipped them together deep into the sea and brought them up finally on her own Egyptian shore . Aithra was glad to have a wily hand in Helen 's history . And so began as confused a mass of supernatural detail as ever bewildered an operatic audience . <P> To kill or not to kill-Menelaus was distracted . Out came his knife and Helen smiled as poets have had her smile , until , hypnotized , he dropped it . But smiling might not always save her and Aithra mixed a potion that would bring forgetfulness and safety . Menelaus drank and Helen became for him a phantom he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen . He was happy for a moment , would start at once for home but Helen had her qualms . She remembered . So did all Greeks and again she appealed to Aithra and again Aithra made magic , spirited them away to a lonely palm grove at the foot of Atlas . <P> There Menelaus woke , distracted still . Helen was pure , but just a shadow Helen . The real one he had killed , just as he killed Paris , just as he would kill anyone who dared rest his eyes on her . Death , Helen decided , was better than a half-mad Menelaus who thought her just a shadow creature , and perhaps death would not come so long as she could smile . Packed away there was another potion that might restore him . Aithra warned her but she took no notice , clapped for wine and balsam and herself brewed the cup of quietude that proved to be remembrance and pathway to a happy ending . <P> The Performance . Laymen seeing it for the first time could make little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to its lowest common denominator : a story of reconciliation wherein the principles begin safe journey to Greece .
