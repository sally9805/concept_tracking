New York City politicians dropped into the Board of Elections office one morning last week to shake the hand of an old man there presiding . His name was John R. Voorhis ; his age , 98 . The occasion for congratulations was his 17th anniversary as Grand Sachem of Tammany Hall . <P> Grand Sachem Voorhis , by no means feeble , thanked everyone and announced that he hoped to pass his 100th birthday with Alfred Emanuel Smith in the White House . He also said : " Everybody talks about Tammany . . . but hardly anyone seems to know . To listen to them talk you 'd think that the Tammany Society was one and the same thing as the Democratic party of this city . But it 's not . The Democratic party became connected with Tammany only because it began years ago to hold its meetings in our hall . " <P> Grand Sachem Voorhis guessed that delegates to the Democratic convention of 1924 in Manhattan had learned " that the Tammany Tiger was not nearly the vicious animal some of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has had one black eye during all its life and only one . " <P> Distinguishing between the Tammany Society and the political machine controlled by its members is something like distinguishing between the social and the business implications of a Lions ' Club luncheon . What Grand Sachem Voorhis meant was that there is such a thing as the Society of St. Tammany , founded in Revolutionary times by a New York upholsterer named William Mooney to give the bourgeoisie a club comparable to the aristocratic Society of the Cincinnati , to which only New York 's fine families belonged . An Indian patron-saint and Indian rigmarole were adopted as a protest against Toryism . The objects of the Society were and have been benevolent-making immigrants comfortable , for example . The activities of the members were and have been political . After comforting immigrants , one can enfranchise them and show them how to vote . <P> The " one black eye " referred to by Grand Sachem Voorhis was , of course , William Marcy ( " Boss " ) Tweed , the coarse , corpulent crook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Sachem . He died in jail 50 years ago . Beside the doings of Tweed , the political peccadilloes of other ' Tammany ' members are dwarfed . Tweed and his " ring , " controlling the city 's Board of Supervisors , cleared tens of millions in letting contracts , selling permits and offices , contributing for the city to " charities . " A plasterer named Garvey once got $133,187.20 for two days ' work from the City . How much Tweed took back no one knows , but he gave $1,800,000 to his two mistresses and the " Ring " once offered the New York Times $5,000,000 to cease " its relentless and ultimately successful exposures.
