txt missing column through your columns , a few very important questions of Mr. Wilson bearing on the subject in question : Is it not a tact that the Association Opposed to the Eighteenth Amendment ( and the Volstead act ) is fighting to get rid of the saloon , something which even the Anti-Saloon League and the Volstead act enforcement corps have not been able to accomplish in the last two years ? Is it not a fact that if light wines and beers were to be sold principally for home consumption , and also to bona fide restaurants , hotels and clubs , this would undoubtedly make the present " cafe " business , which almost entirely consists of selling bootleg whisky , an unprofitable one ! Any one not blind and with common sense will admit that not one saloon would remain in business thirty days if it depended on its sales of soft drinks and near-beer for a livelihood . Is it not a fact that cider of 2.75 per cent . alcoholic content is regarded legally as non-intoxicating and as such permitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But beer of 2.75 per cent . alcoholic content is not permitted to be manufactured or sold . If the former is non-intoxicating , why not the latter ? Besides all the above , we have a fine situation with many millions of dollars being spent by the Government annually to try to enforce the prohibition laws on land , while the selling of all kinds of intoxicating liquors is permitted on all ships flying the American flag ( outside the three-mile limit ) twenty-four hours of every day by the United States Government through its own representatives , the Shipping Board .
