The Moore mystery of a fortnight ago became more of a mystery last week . Both of the rumors about Alexander Pollock Moore , onetime ( 1923-25 ) U. S. Ambassador to Spain , came true . President Coolidge appointed him Ambassador to Peru five days after he had purchased two tabloids : the New York Daily Mirror and the Boston Advertiser . William Randolph Hearst , who had never before sold any profitable publication , was the seller . The price was considered too " personal " to be made public . People wondered how Mr. Moore intended to divide his time between solving Peruvian diplomacy and pleasing U. S. gum-chewers . <P> Mr. Moore hinted that he might make of the Mirror and Advertiser a buckle for a nation-wide chain of tabloids . When asked about contemplated negotiations , he said : " You do n't have to negotiate . They are offered to you . " Concerning the most important problem of a tabloid publisher , Mr. Moore weaseled his stand : " We do not make the news . If it happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I want to make a distinction between sensationalism and salaciousness . We will not tolerate the latter . " <P> There were no startling changes during the first few days of the Moore regime . Photographs of girls with their legs crossed and dresses barely covering the hips continued to appear on the front pages ; Elinor Glyn kept on writing about " It ; " Gustave Flaubert 's Madame Bovary ran along in pictorial form so that no gum-chewer could miss the point . In the Mirror were photographs of a Negro and a white baby , " brought together by fate " at the Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan . The Negro infant got the caption : <P> GOSH , WOTT A WORLD ! <P> William Shakespeare , bard , also contributed to the Mirror on the opening day of Mr. Moore 's ownership . Said he at the top of the editorial page : " O , how full of briers is this working-day world ! " Readers of the Mirror were offered $5 apiece for published letters answering the question : " If YOU were publishing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet your tastes and interests ? " <P> The Mirror achieved its greatest notoriety under the editorship of Philip A. Payne , who ran bloated Harry K. Thaw out of town ( TIME , Sept. 28 , 1925 ) , reopened the Hall-Mills case , finally perished in the Old Glory flight . Founded three and a half years ago , the Mirror was Mr. Hearst 's reply to the challenge of the Daily News ( Chicago Tribune-owned tabloid ) for supremacy among the gum-chewers . Although the Mirror has today a circulation of 450,000 it lags far behind the Daily News , which has 1,225,000 . The younger pornoGraphic of Bernarr Macfadden has 285,000 . <P> The Boston Advertiser has 190,000 on weekdays ; 510,000 on Sunday .
