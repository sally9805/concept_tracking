Lightning is a serious menace to electrical apparatus . Temperamentally it is unsuited to laboratory experimentation . One can not lasso the lightning and cage it in a condenser for study at leisure . But the General Electric Company can now make it to order . Last week Physicist Frank William Peek Jr . announced in his address to the regional convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers that artificial lightning of 3,600,000 volts had been produced by a new generator in the high voltage engineering laboratory at Pittsfield , Mass . <P> Just as the positive and negative electric charges are separated and stored in the thunder cloud until the electric potential reaches the breaking point and the lightning is released , so this new generator stores electricity until ready to discharge it in one blinding flash . <P> The flash lasts a few millionths of a second but years have been spent in building up its strength . Seven years ago the Pittsfield laboratory announced 1,000,000 volts , four years later this figure was doubled . Still the work goes on . The present power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; about 17 times greater than the highest voltage transmission line in this country ; and far beyond any voltage produced by natural lightning on transmission lines . <P> Despite its brevity , the life line of the lightning flash has been accurately measured by the cathode ray oscillograph . This is an instrument developed by the General Electric Company at Schenectady and makes use of a beam of electrons which , acting as a pointer , measures- the rise &; fall , or wave shape of the voltages . When a wave of lightning encounters an obstruction it builds up to twice its power , just as a wave of water breaking on a wall will splash about twice its height . Therefore a direct voltage of 3,000,000 traveling along a line will suddenly jump to over 5,000,000 volts in &; for the brief instant that it strikes the end of the line . <P> Chained lightning will be the means of studying electricity with the hope of protecting life and property against natural lightning ; of building transmission lines , transformers , and other electrical apparatus to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
