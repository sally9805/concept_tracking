The Politics of Famine DISTRESS is a harsh schoolmaster , and it commonly happens that his pupils are too angry , too worried , too busy with quarrels among themselves , to heed his lessons . A year ago we talked in England of the " crisis " of unemployment . Habit had taught us to expect a brief cyclical depression of trade , and the country prepared itself to meet it by the usual expedients of telling the workers to tighten their belts , and dispensing doles to the victims of a momentary " slump . " As the months followed each other , the word " crisis " became inapplicable . We are realizing that the causes which have flung three million men and women out of work in our island , are still capable of a long and steady operation . For all practical purposes our Continental market disappeared with the war as completely as though some unexampled deluge had submerged all Europe from the Volga to the Rhine . An impoverished Europe can not buy from us . In the early months that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thought that in the South American and other distant markets they would more than recoup themselves for the loss of Europe . Experience has taught them better . Since Europe can no longer buy Brazilian coffee , colonial wool , Egyptian cotton , Chilean nitrate and Argentine meat on the old scale , it follows that the countries which produce these things are less able to absorb our manufactured goods . In the second place , Germany , with her industries working full time under the lash of the indemnity , has found in cheap labor based on the depreciated mark , the key to unlock these markets . Her activity may bring her little benefit , since she labors for the victors , but while her own workers remain underfed and half-clad , she is beginning to send out to distant markets a stream of exports , with which our own can not compete . Various remedies are debated . Partly in despair and partly in malice , our employing class is cutting wages drastically , but that expedient will be futile , unless it ends by reducing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some experts fasten on the symptom of the European disease of poverty , and talk of stabilizing the currencies . With more insight , Mr. Churchill inveighs with belated eloquence against the folly with which all the belligerent governments have loaded each other with debts and indemnities . They are learning today that an international debt may be , forcreditor and debtor alike , an unmitigated curse . Some of us knew it in advance . I fought the constituency next door to Mr. Churchill 's in the general election of 1918 . I was beaten because I preached the folly of indemnities , while he won his seat on the cry of " making the Germans pay . " A year or two more of these miseries may conceivably bring us to the point of cancelling debts all round . The now fashionable remedy is , however , to foster British trade with the Continent by a system of guarantees to British banks , which in their turn are to back British merchants in the effort to sell British goods on long , credit to the smaller countries of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has a very limited range . In the first place , what Poland and Austria want is not so much manufactured goods , as raw materials for their own industries . In the second place , it is folly to try to sell to these countries while , on the plea that their currency fosters unfair competition , we prevent them by our new duties from selling to us . In the third place , these countries are more naturally a German market ; we shall fail to undersell her goods , and even could we do so , the result would be to cause more mischief than benefit . Finally , by a strange obstinacy , the list of markets which are to be fostered , still excludes the biggest , the hungriest and the most neglected of all . Russia is not on the schedule . To suggest that we ought to start trading with Russia , while she is agonizing under the Volga famine , may raise an unkindly smile . Certainly to expect any early return would be folly , and it may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even so , if there were grave doubt whether much , or any of our assisted exports to Russia would ever be repaid , I should still defend this plan . Today we are paying out millions in unemployed doles and parish relief to our unemployed . Which is wiser , to give these inadequate and demoralizing grants to keep men barely alive in idleness , or to pay them wages to make spades and ploughs for Russia ? , You might never get it back . True . But in any case we are dumping extensively . I met a man the other day who had just returned from the West African coast , where he had been selling vast quantities of textiles to Negroes at half the prices ruling in England . One should not grudge the Negroes their luck , but textiles in their climate are a luxury . There is a tragic lack of them in Russia . Assume at the worst that the labor costs might never be recouped , we should still be no poorer than if we had given the same money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuredly pay for the material . The positive argument for this course is that it would be an investment . It would restore Russia to her place in the world 's economic system . It wants but little imagination to see in detail how the process would work . Give me a train load of nails , screws , saws , axes , and scythes , not to speak of boots , galoshes , and overcoats , and let me travel with it through the Ukraine or Siberia , where the harvest this year has been reasonably good . Let me barter its contents for grain , and I will undertake to fill an almost indefinite number of trains with the proceeds of my deal . The scarcity value of one mixed packet of nails and screws is fabulous in Russia . I tested that last year with a few which I took as gifts to peasants . For months and even years , you might go on exchanging such goods against grain , at a rate many times above that prevailing in the world market . The first destination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next harvest on the Volga . The next use for it should be to feed the starving millions of its population , until that harvest is reaped . That is only beginning , however . Suppose that in touring about with my train load of foreign goods , I am able to announce confidently that I shall be round again on the same route after the next harvest with a train twice as long , and ready to do business at a Somewhat lower rate of barter . What will be the result ? That these peasants , who during seven Years of war , civil war and blockade , have never seen a load of foreign goods and have almost forgotten that such things can be bought and earned , Will at once set to work to increase their area of cultivation . I am writing of conditions which I have seen . even to quadruple the pre-war yield of Russia in grain . That magic requires , of course , the intervention of the cooperative organization as medicine man . With ploughs and reapers as your bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abandon its two or three field system , to break up its long narrow strips of soil into fields capable of cultivation by machinery , to adopt a proper rotation of crops , and to form itself into an " arta " ( cooperative guild ) for disciplined labor in common . I never cease to marvel at the miracles and the failures of capitalistic enterprise . Is your object killing , then all the banks will rush to aid you to perform it , on the long credit system . You may mobilize all the industry of civilization to make your munitions for you , and all in return for an I. 0 . U. But announce that your purpose is the saving of life and the restoration of a fertile land , ask for ploughs instead of machine guns , admit that little return is to be expected for two or three years , and not all the prospects of a mighty harvest in the future will conjure from industry even its unsaleable stocks and its embarrassing surplus . I have often asked Myself what I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November , 1918 . I never hesitate for an instant over the first step . I would have continued the war-time control of the world 's industry for a few months longer and extended it to enemy countries until in England , Germany and America , I had collected vast stocks of railway engines , lorries , motor ploughs and reapers . I would have borrowed if necessary to do it , and then I would have scattered these instruments of salvation , more lavishly than aerial bombs , over all the devastated East of Europe . It would have cost no more than the millions squandered on Denikin and Kolchak . In their wisdom the Big Four preferred to blockade . They organized famine , and now it stalks the earth . On the Volga they lack bread , and on the Thames we go idle . I have tried in vain to popularize this notion in England . I venture to put it before American readers in the hope of meeting there with some adventurous mind , who has the will and the means to realize it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to use no stronger term , which the West feels towards Russia . Most of it is based on false " news , " collected by secret service agents from " White " refugees . I shall never forget the positive vertigo of surprise with which on coming out of Russia , I read the news that had appeared in English papers of doings there during the two months of my stay . What mattered was not so much that the news itself was either totally false or grossly exaggerated , what mattered was that the whole background , the entire picture of life , the estimate of what is probable and possible in Russia , was distorted out of any resemblance to fact . No one really believes that Lenin and Trotsky fight a daily duel over a nationalized woman , and then flee abroad in aeroplanes . But it is believed that every sort of murder , robbery , violence and lust is universal and habitual . Now the main fact , the broad fact , is order and security . The exceptions are apt to be sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so frequent as the Black and Tan outrages were until the other day in Ireland , or lynchings in the Southern States . I encounter everywhere in England , in the effort to gather money for the Volga famine , the belief that the Red army will steal it all . My difficulty is to know where to begin with my contradictions . I want to tell the angry City Merchant that the Red army consists of young men , mostly the sons of peasants , neither better nor worse by nature than they were under the Tsar . The chief difference is that from being drunken they have become sober , instead of idling they go to school , and whereas they were illiterate , they now can read . But experience warns me that if I say this and describe my three week &; at the Red army headquarters , I shall meet with mere incredulity . I tell him instead that the English Quakers have distributed relief for eighteen months in Russia ( I saw them at their splendid and generous work ) , that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , that they lost as much or more in other countries , and finally that when one consignment of goods did go astray , the Soviet government at once replaced its value by a check on London . That makes him hesitate . " But surely , " he retorts , " the Red army did requisition mercilessly in the villages and steal the peasants ' grain ? " Of course it did requisition . It could do nothing else . There was a drought that year . The towns were near to starving . The requisitions ( which , by the way , began in 1916 under the Tsar ) were not private robbery , but a desperate measure for the general salvation to provide food for the towns . What was wrong about them was not that the grain was taken , but that the state factories , busy in making munitions against Wrangel and the Poles , turned out no goods for distribution among the peasants . The goods were not to be had . Just because barter was impossible , force had to be used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little less . The fault lay not in the plan , which was one of exchange under state auspices , but in the fact that the state , owing to the blockade and the civil wars , had nothing to give for the grain . The plan I propose is to reverse all this , to provide the goods , and have faith that the grain will grow . Having gone thus far , I encounter another objection . If we give this relief , still more if we give credits , we shall bolster up a system of violence , and strengthen a party which is plotting world-revolution . Well , if the City Merchant imagines that by letting the peasants die by the million on the Volga , he will bring down the Soviet government , I can only give my modest opinion that he is mistaken . Russians are fatalists to an extent inconceivable by us . The Soviet , moreover , is very clever in putting its own gloss on events , and its gloss in this case might have the merit of truth . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same City Merchant , who first hired the Poles and the Whites to attack , then blockaded , and finally looked on inactive at famine . I stake what credit I may have on the prediction that the one relatively capable party in Russia will continue to govern , even after this catastrophe , but if I am mistaken , I risk a second prediction . The result of upsetting it will not be any sort of order , however " White , " but a chaos and a perennial civil war more desperate than anything in the past . To come now to the more serious argument , I am not going to stultify myself by admitting that the Soviet government is bloody , violent and cruel . Its central aim is humanitarian and much of its achievement , especially in the schools , puts richer nations to shame . But without a doubt it does rely on force : it represses and polices ruthlessly , and it does not scruple to shoot a plotter . The City Merchant and I are at one in wishing that this ugly reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it come to end ? Only by replacing the motive of obedience to force by the ordinary economic motives . If I have no goods to trade with in the village , if the town will starve unless I can get grain from the village , well then , horrible as it sounds , I think I have the right to threaten to shoot the village , unless it will give up its hoarded grain . A bad plan . A cruel plan . But after all the only plan , in a state of civil war and blockade . I would put it to the City Merchant , that only if he will help to get goods for barter into the village , can this system of force come to an end . Stop the plotting , the invading , the blockading , try the experiment of trade instead , and then complain if the violence still goes on . A menaced and boycotted government can only be violent . It lacks the means to govern by reliance on the normal economic motives . I believe that my trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would carry hope and good temper , confidence and industry . The tone of command would die out in the official 's voice . He would be surprised to find that he need no longer order and threaten his charges to work . Lastly a word on world-revolution . That is a dead bogey . Today the Russian state has restored private property , and legalized private trade . It has given up the attempt to change society by one sudden effort . Its whole thought is now the consolidation and restoration of Russia . It is not going to risk its own future by bringing down the wrath of the rest of the world upon itself . Only today as I write , the papers contain an exhortation from Moscow to the Third International to drop " direct action " and " respect the armistice with - capitalism . " The will to a truce exists . Truces of that kind last as long as the wisdom of both sides . Let the West use the truce and Moscow will have no motive to break it . Not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you hope to modify the political system of Russia . Its violence will disappear when the smile returns to the face of the Russian peasant and the Russian soil . Trust your goods to this starving yet fruitful land , have faith yourselves in the economic laws in which you believe , and in two harvests or three , half a continent , derelict today , may return to the comity of mankind .
