txt Railroad officials declared last night that the strike of harbor employes had ! collapsed so far as the operation of ferries was concerned and that , while the situation with respect to tugs . lighters and barges was more serious , all danger of an interruption in the City 's food supply had been averted . Leaders of the Marine Workers ' Alliance , on the other hand , asserted that a misunderstanding had prevc ited all of the workers frrom joining the strike and predicted that the ferries would all be tied up by nightfall today . The railroad mend however , were confident in their assurances that normal schedules Would be restored on Monday . Members of the old crews in sufficient numbers to man the boats had remained loyal , according to the railroad managers , and the deficiency was being made up by men from other cities . The situation last night with respect to the ferry lines was as follows : The Lackawanna ferries kept up their usual service , and other lines which had Suspended during the previous night , resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Shore , which was completely tied up all day . Pennsylvania Railroad ferries between Manhattan and Jersey City were operating on irregular schedules . Tickets were sold " subject to delay . " The Erie boats between Twenty-third . Street and Pavonia Avenue , Jersey City , which had been maintaining an irregular schedule all day , suspended service shortly after 8 o'clock last night , when the crews deserted . There was a long line of trucks on both sides of the river , and many passengers were waiting in the fcrryhouses . The crews of the Erie ferries from Chambers Street also quit about the same time , stopping the boats . Central Railroad of New Jersey , from Jersey City to West Twenty-third Street and Liberty Street , had two boats running on each line as usual , but there were many delays , said to be due to the fog . . Fog Hampers Ferry Service . The service went to pieces during the rush hour last night , but the heavy fog , Which harbor men say was the worst in years , was blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been impossible , even with regular crews , to make normal headway . The municipal ferryboats , which are not in : volved in the strike , were as irregular ! in their trips as the railroad ferries . A riot started on the ferryboat Chicago of the Pennsylvania Railroad late last night when twenty-five men , said to be strikers , attacked the deckhands . Or e man was badly hurt , several others received minor injuries , and a panic among the passengers resulted . The disturbance started just as the boat pulled out of the slip at the foot of Cortland Street . The uproar was heard all over the boat , and the passengers ran to the cabins , seeking safety . When the Captain learned of the trouble he stopped his engines and then backed the boat into the ferry slip . Five policemen from the Old Slip Station had heard the tumult from the shore , and they were waiting when the boat was tied up . When the rioters became aware of the Captain 's strategem they scattered and mingled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed tinder arrest . They described themselves as Fred Carlson , a fireman , of 1501 Grove Street , Jersey City ; John Gee , a deckhand , of 320 Seventh Avenue , Jersey City ; Frank Canary , who said he was an official of " Local No. 8 , " of 299 Eighth Avenue , Jersey City ; Charles White , a deckhand , of 45 Montgomery Street , Jersey City ; Alphonso Laugel , a tug dispatcher , of 1,002 Birch Street , West Bergen , N. J. , and William Smith , a deckhand , of 327 Seventh Avenue , Jersey City . Alfred Howe , a deckhand , of 5 Stratford Road , Brooklyn , was the most seriously injured . He was taken to a Jeroey . City hospital suffering from severe Cate and bruises on his head and body . Howe had been employed on the Chicago or several years and had refused to gelspond to the strike call . Eighty per cent . of the tugs , lighters barges are laid up , the rallroaa men tted , but they said that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the tunnels and over the ferries , the city was getting about 40 per cent . of its normal supply . al'ortunately , it was said , the holidays give the railroads extra time to bring in new men . so that on Monday conditions would be sufficiently improved to guarantee a steady food supply . An embargo on all incoming and outgoing freight requiring lighterage has been declared , J. J. Mantel ! , Chairman i of the New York Railroad Manag.srs ' Association , said , but he added that it would hardly be effective before it Would be lifted . The number of strikers , according to Mr. Mantell , who is also General Man- ager of the Erie Railroad , is about 2,400 . Officers of the Marine Workers ' Alliance , on the other hand , said that 4.500 men were out and that 0,000 would be out tonight . The union leaders asserted that the night crews on some of the boats had refused to recognize . the . authority of the notification for the strike , but that the strike call would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert their posts . The loyalty of a:large proportion of the harbor , men to their employers and their refusal to do the bidding of the . strike leaders was the chief factor in keeping the ferries running , Mr. Mantell said . " All of the old captains and pilots were back today , " he said , " as well as a. large number of other workers . The engineers , in the case of several of the roads , were back to work in a body . Strikebreakers at Work . " We arc replacing the men who quit with men from Philadelphia and other Eastern ports . Most of these men have harbor boat experience . Twenty per cent . of the tugs are at work . We expect to have 60 per cent . employed tomorrow , and by Monday things will be running ' about the same as they always were . The chief thing that is bothering as is the fog . If it lifts tonight the ferries will be running regularly tomorrow and Sunday . " Mr. Mantell said that the railroads were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . Arrangements are being made to accommodate the new workers in box cars and sleeping cars in Jersey City . Special plans for police protection have also been made . ? The only affect of the strike on the milk supply here yesterday was to delay the deliveries several hours . Officials of the milk companies said that there was no immediate danger of a milk famine . A large part of the supply comes from upState and does not have to be transported across the harbor . L. E. Unger. transportation manager of the Borden 's Farm Products Company , said that the railroads had promised normal deliveries by today . The delay last night , he said , was caused by the congestion on the ferries which held up the trucks for several hours . Officials of the Sheffield Farms Company said that halt of their supply came through the up-State railroads and the tubes . ' We have a good supply of Grade B milk on hand . " it was said . " We do n't think the public will suffer . The regular supply is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing our best to move it . We have just succeeded in getting the last of yesterday 's supply across the water . The situation will be more serious if more men go out . but with the present schedule 's being maintained there is no immediate fear of the supply running out . " Coal Not Seriousls Affected. , The city 's coal supply v.-ill be little affected by the strike , it was said yesterday . Arrangements have been made for bringing coal into the city through the Pennsylvania tunnel if necessary . Most of the coal , however , is handled by independent lighterage companies . The Erie Railroad , for example , Is having sixty carloads of coal brought here every day under a contract with a private lighterage concern . Edward J. O'Malley , Commissioner of Markets , asserted that food dealers in the city were already using the strike as an excuse to boost their prices . " Numerous instances of this have been brought to my attention , " he said . " There is absolutely . no reason why prices should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all the companies which bring food supplies Into , the city only one has stopped service . This food will be brought over on lighters and ferries ' of other companies and by lighters occupied by strikebreakers . " The union officials at the headquarters of the Marine Workers ' Affiliation , 26 Park Place , were busy with conferences all day yesterday in an attempt to cause a complete tleup of the railroad boats . A sympathetic . strike of longshoremen and Government intervention . on the ground that the Erie , in selling seven of its lighters to CharlS.s R. Stewart , formerly mariae superintendent of the road , was guilty of a subterfuge to evade the Esch-Cummins eight-hour law for railway workers , are two of the plans under consideration . . lirie Road Defends Sale . When Mr. Mantell was told of the assertion of the strike leaders that they would welcome a Government investigation of the sale of the Erie boats he raid : " The only violation they would pfind esa:o tun ** lib:0 371 otlii et hpea , r2tr a onfsptohret a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their agente and their . employes to make a reasonable effort to prevent any interruption In transportation .

On March 1 Mr. Stewart a as . appointed consulting engineer of the 1 Erie . The railroad has hundreds of such positions . which du not require the full services of the men employed . Mr. Stewart resigned on March 15 , and he is not now Connected with the railroad . ? ' As to the assertion that the boats were not i egularly transferred to kr . Stewart , that statement is absurd .

The Eric is willing to sell seven other lighters to Captain Maher or any of the union men if they wish to buy them . I told them so at the conference they had with me Thursday . " Transfer of Boats Explained . Mr. Mantell issued the following prepared statement concerning the transfer of the . boats : In February the management of the Erie Railroad had information collected as to the cost of lightering freight in Greater New York Harbor . Their research developed that the cost of lighterage in the Harbor of Greater New York was $3.04 per ton , for which service the Erie boats engaged in that traffic received 60 cents per ton and , later the present price of 80 cents per ton . The management decided that business secured at a lighterage cost Of $1.24 per ton was non-remunerative , and on March 1 , the date the roads ' Were turned back to the corporation , the steam lighters were laid up and have been since that time for sale . A similar state of affairs existed'in ? the matter of steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 steam tug service in Greater New.e York Harbor had been stopped three times , and in no instance through any act of the owners of railway tugs ; and today there is no controversy between the Eric Railroad and the employes of its marine department as to wages or hours of service . The law requires the hours of service to be eight , and the Erie Is a law-abiding corporation . A towing interest made a proposition to the Erie Railroad to do Its towing at a certain rate based on the existing tariffs in effect in New- York Harbor . This arrangement the Erie Railroad accepted , and incidentally sold to the towing company several of its tug 's . It can not be too plainly stated that tile Erie Railroad has had no controversy with it- 1 e- . Mr. Mantell said that Joseph Stanton . business agent of the Port and Terminal Workers ' Union , had been ejected from an Erie ferry house Thursday night . The railroad manager said that Stanton had made three attempts to board Eric ferryboats during the night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , who are placed there to sea that the men operating the boats are protect:al from strike agents . roucemen Guard Ferries . Policemen from the Old Slip , Beach Street and uptown stations , were stationed at all the railroad ferries yesterday to prevent possible clashes between the strikers and non-union men . Scores of detectives were also used at the ferryhouses on both sides of the river and on the boats there were.railroad detectives and special guards . A delegation of three men who said they were from a New York local of the Port and Terminal Workers , called on Chief of Police Richard Battersby at Jersey City last night and asked if the police could not do something to stop the hiring of strikebreakers . Chief Battersby told the men that his sole function ' was to see that both sides kept the peace. , .

Last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fog , causing a camOct : : abandonment of the regular scheltiles . ? The ' fog ? was at its ? heaviest during the rush hour and thousands . of persons were delayed . . . . - - Hudson Tubes . Jammed . Many ? of , the commuters hurried to the Hudson Tubes , causing the worst jam that the tunnels haVe had in years . Captain Himmel and twelve policemen from the Old Slip Station were sent to the Hudson Terminal Buildings to regulate the traffic and prevent disorder . A large part of the crowd was delayed fur more than an hour . The rush in the tubes:glad continued throughout the day . The majority of the Jersey commuters apparently had decided not to chance the uncertainty of ferry schedules . The The ferryboat Cranford of the Central Railroad of New Jersey crashed into the pier at the south pier at the foot of Liberty Street yesterday afternoon during the fog , tnrowing a team , of horses and two men overboard . The men were saved with life rings . According to the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Conway , but Captain William A. Maher , President of the Masters , Mates and Pilots ' . Association , asserted last night that the pilot was " Jim " Conlin , a strikebreaker . Both of the men who fell overboard hurried from the boat without . giving their names . The team belonged to the Burns Brothers Coal Company . Several passengers were knocked down by the force of the collision and were treated for slight bruises . The harbor strike spread to tugboat men along the South Brooklyn and Bay Ridge shores yesterday , according to an official of the Bush.Terminal. ** was said that many of the deep sea men had gone out in sympathy with the coastwise workers . At Bush Terminal and other piers it was said that some of the workers had quit , but no figures could , be obtained . Union delegates were busy all along the Brooklyn waterfront . At the office of the New York Dock Railway Company , which controls the Atlantic and Fulton Terminals , it was said that 300 men were absent , not because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The harbormen 's leaders said that the railroad officials ' statements to the effect that most of the workers had remained loyal was untrue and declared that the boats were being manned by strikebreakers . They threatened to calm upon the other harbor workers ' organizations to tie up the port of New York . The Marine Workers ' Affiliation , it was learned yesterday , has appealed to Samuel Gompers to use his influence to get the International Longshoremen 's Association to join Id a sympathetic strike . Two conciliators from the State Industrial Commission started an inquiry into the strike yesterday . They are Michael Regan and John Bealin . They conferred for an hour with union leaders yesterday , but did not reach the railroad managers . The harbormen received word here yesterday of the death of a son of T. V. O'Connor . International President of the Longshoremn 's Association , in Buffalo . Mr. O'Connor was to have attended a conference in ' Washington - yesterday at which an effort to conciliate the coastwise longshoremen 's strike was to have been made . Between 1,500 and 2.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Webster Hall , 119 East Eleventh Street , and were told by Thomas B. Healey ' that no effort had been made or would be made to bring the deep sea longshoremen into the strike . Both Healey and Capt . William A. Maher . Vice President of the Marine ' Workers ' Affiliation , and Business Agent of the Masters . Mates and Pilots , asserted that one of the main purposes of the meeting last night was to refute a statement attributed to J. 3 . Mantel ! , of the Erie Railroad , that the strike was the result of internal differences in the union . Mr. Healey declared that the marine workers decided to remain- out as a unit until all- return to work with increased pay , as demanded , and an eighthour day . He said that H. L. Joyce . Chairman of the Associated Marine Department , had already passed upon and returned to the railroad managers . the demands of the men of the various organizations for increased wages , but they had not yet heard what his findings were . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers had offered $10 a month increase in wages and an eight-hour day , but that this would not be accepted . : He also declared that the unions had information that it was the purpose of the other railroads to do as the Erie was charged with doing  --  sell its boats to private owners in order to avoid the eight-hour day . 3 . F. Murphy and E. W. Rice of Chicago . traveling representatives of the Brotherhood of Railroad Patrolmen , addressed the meeting- last night , and it was said they urged the marine workers to stand out for the eight-hour day and that : the railroad brotherhoods would give their support in their efforts . Mr. Healey said that at the hour of the closing of the meeting there were in operation two ferryboats of the Penn-. syseatda , five of the Lackawanna , four of the : . Erie and three of the Central of New Jersey , but that all would he stopped before morning with the possible exception of the LaeSawanna boats .
