Five million dollars of the money extracted by John D. Rockefeller from Pennsylvania 's oil-bearing substrata were last week applied to perpetuate the surface grandeur of 600 square miles of the Appalachian chain far south of Pennsylvania . The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial fund announced that it had underwritten half of the $10,000,000 fund sought for the Great Smoky Mountains National park . Public subscription and the legislatures of North Carolina and Tennessee had provided most of the other $5,000,000 required to buy what will be the outstanding national park in the eastern U. S. <P> Who first called them " The Great Smokies , " from the smoldering haze that hangs upon them , no one knows . They stretch for 200 miles northeast and southwest paralleling the Blue Ridge ( 40 miles southeast ) . Master chain of the Appalachians , they wall off Tennessee from North Carolina . Near a place called Indian Gap , the snag-toothed divide is so sharp that a mountaineer 's misstep would plunge him dizzily into one State or the other . <P> Accessible to three-fourths of the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia 's southern boundary , except Mt . Washington in New Hampshire ( 6293 ft. ) , still frequented by Cherokee Indians , the new park will be advertised as a rival of Yellowstone , Glacier , Yosemite . In place of naked peaks it raises up lofty , rolling domes fringed with balsam . Its bears are black instead of grizzled and the deer frisk white tails in place of the western black . For lodgepole pines and wind-torn spruce , are substituted every variety of tree and shrub that one would find in a trip from Georgia to the St. Lawrence-including flourishing chestnuts ( now moribund from Pennsylvania north ) , holly , magnolia , the rare yellowwood , giant hemlocks , 30-ft. huckleberry bushes , acres of mountain laurel , rhododendrons with 18-inch trunks . Only lately have the Great Smokies been accurately mapped , and then a plane had to fly back and forth over them for days . There are no roads yet through the heart of the region , but soon one will be built , presumably with a filling station on majestic Mt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dome . <P> Hard by , the Great Smoky Mountains park , a 327,000-acre swath of Blue Ridge territory , six to ten miles wide , between Front Royal and Waynesboro in Virginia , is to be secured as the Shenandoah National park . Last week , the $4,000,000 fund necessary for this project was reported within $100,000 of completion .
