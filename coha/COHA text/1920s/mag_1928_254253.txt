Forgotten Faces . She is sitting at a piano , playing idly . Suddenly , she stops ; curls her fingers , tigress-like . There is a man standing near her . She seizes him , pulls him down on her lap , bites the back of his neck , twists a handful of his hair . Then she stands up , arches her spine , leads the man into a bedroom . <P> Her name is Olga Baklanova ; her address is c/o **30;6831;TOOLONG Corp. , Hollywood , Calif . Compared with her , Theda Bara and the oldtime cinema-bad-women were fudge-makers . She was born in Russia and first achieved fame in the Moscow Art Theatre . Morris Guest , shrewd , brought her to the U. S. She played the nun in the road show of The Miracle . Then the movies got her . In The Street of Sin , The Man Who Laughs and her present triumph , Forgotten Faces , she demonstrates that she is , far and away , the most voluptuous cinemactress . <P> The story of Forgotten Faces was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Ambassador to Italy , and by Oliver Hazard Perry Garrett , onetime crack reporter on the New York World . The above seduction scene causes a gentleman crook named Heliotrope Harry ( Clive Brook ) to kill the man in the bedroom and have nothing more to do with the woman , his wife . He goes to jail for murder , is released years later . His major problem is to keep his grown-up daughter away from the evil influence of his wife . Success crowns his efforts when both he and his wife are killed in an absurd climax . <P> Miss Baklanova goes from pianos to milk bottles and straight gin with convincing ease . The film is superbly directed . <P> The Perfect Crime . " The greatest detective in the world " ( Clive Brook ) retires because criminals are so stupid . He will show them how ; he commits " the perfect crime , " a murder without a single clew . But finally , he is forced to confess in order to save the life of an innocent man . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime was by no means perfect . The acting of Clive Brook and Irene Rich was exasperating . The " talkie " parts were atrocious , partly faked. * <P> The Mysterious Lady . They say that Greta Garbo once went to see one of her own films and has never done so again . The reason : she was sickened by the long and langorous close-ups which delight cinemaddicts . There are plenty of such close-ups in The Mysterious Lady . But otherwise . Miss Garbo gives a dignified and stirring performance as Russia 's greatest pre-War lady spy . The man in the case ( Conrad Nagel ) fails to click . <P> <P> * The actor moves his lips while a person off stage talks into the recording device .
