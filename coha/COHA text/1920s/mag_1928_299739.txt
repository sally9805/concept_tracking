" Mais ! Qu'ils sont touchs par le soleil ! " Thus cried admiring Belgians to one another , last week , as they welcomed home to Brussels beloved King Albert and <P> Queen Elizabeth , who have just toured the Belgian Congo ( TIME , Aug. 6 ) . <P> Their Majesties were indeed touchs ( tanned ) by the blazing Afric Sun . <P> They have soared in throbbing airplanes more than 1,500 miles over Congo swamps , diamond mines , cannibals , palm oil factories , pigmies , ivory hunters , and savage , slimy , man-eating crocodiles . Also Their Majesties sailed a thousand miles down the mighty River Congo ( larger than any other except the Amazon ) . By way of climax , they skirted the edge of the Great Pigmy Forest , one of the gruesome wonders of the world . Appalling , it is a place from which dense , choking creepers and great trees shut out the sun . In the gloom spiteful brown pigmies plant poisoned stakes and shoot poisoned arrows , to keep out both white men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homecoming . Crown Princess Astrid of the Belgians , Their Majesties ' Swedish daughter-in-law , was flayed last week , by a fanatically Roman Catholic news organ , Le Vingtieme Sicle . Wrote its Priest-Editor : " A recent photograph of Her Royal Highness shows her seated , with the skirt somewhat above the knees . The radiant beauty of the Princess aroused sufficient admiration in itself without the addition of such a piece of trivial daring . The example coming from the throne , or even the steps of the throne , is the most substantial bar that can be opposed to shameless fashions. "
