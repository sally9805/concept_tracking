MAD LOVE-Pola Negri succeeds in occasionally vivifying a typical sirenade of Liane , the toast of the boulevards , whose specialty is driving lover after lover to ruin , death , or the booby-hatch . After tenting on the old vamp ground unrepentantly , through numerous reels , she discovers sin 's ultimate wage to be strangulation and is murdered by ex-lover No. 19 in the middle of a carnival . A German film with the usual admirable mass-effects . <P> MR . BILLINGS SPENDS His DIME- Walter Hiers in a role originally designed for Wallace Reid-the dashing young American who foils the revolutionists of one of those South American republics , all for love of the President 's daughter . The story would have been well-suited to Wallace Reid 's light touch-but it seems to fit Mr. Hiers a little tightly about the hips . <P> THE FROZEN NORTH-A most hilarious take-off on the superfilm of the Great Open Spaces where Men are Men , starring Buster Keaton .                   @ @
