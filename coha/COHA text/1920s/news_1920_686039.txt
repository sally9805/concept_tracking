txt The farmers appeal to Congress against unsympathetic treatment by Secretary ' HOUSTON on behalf of the Treasury , and Governor HARDING on behalf of the Federal Reserve . With due respect it may be said that it is an appeal from those who know ? to those who know less , and the danger is not remote that the country may suffer from the action of those who fancy that their edicts are economic law . The prospects seem best for some plan like Senator CAPPER 'S to abolish gambling in futures , or like Senator HITCHCOCK 'S to appropriate $60,000.000 Federal Reserve funds for direct relief of the farmers . Admitting for argument that nothing better could be done , and assuming that it had been done long ago when the effects : would have been better than now , what . would have bekn the result to the farmers and the country ? The answer . may be found by looking at what happened where the farmers have had their way . The farmers rule North Dakota , and twenty banks have ? suspended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and there have been sporadic failures in other States where farmers ' finance is fancied , such as Iowa and Montana . Have the farmers benefited to such an extent that the embarrassment of the banks by excess of accommodation to them need not be regretted ? On the contrary , the farmers are worse off than they would have been ' if the prairie bankers had imitated the Federal Reserve and the Treasury . They hold at $1.35 wheat which they could have sold for $2.35 to $2.40 at their country stations , . if they disliked the prices on the city exchanges . Can the country stand the diversion of Federal Reserve funds for similar uses ? And what reason is there to think that , if the thing were done , the farmers would benefit any more than in the unhappy record referred to ? The real trouble with the farmers is set out in the statement in TIE ANNALIST by the President of the Guaranty Trust Company that there have been ? - produced 2,000,000 more bales of cotton and 300,000,000 more bushels of wheat than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case , - and they make ridiculous the statement on Sunday by BENJAMIN MARSH , Director of the Farmers ' National Council , to the Chicago Federation of Labor , when he said that there is a " criminal conspiracy to drive " down the prices of farm products " way below the cost of production , " and that . " the Federal Reserve sys " tern now is controlled by the big " predatory.financial interests . * * * " The financial interests23.000 per " sons out of our 105,000,000 ? are as " determined to crush the farmers " they are to crush labor . " It is difficult to understand how honest and intelligent men can believe such nonsense . The fact that they 4:16 believe it is no reason for allowing them to have their way , harming both themselves and others . Consider next Senator CAPPER 'S bill to put an end to " gambling " in farm products by closing the City-exchanges to all but " farmers , dealers and manufacturers . " The business is to he done by amateurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the farmers ' troubles , and it is to be stopped for the farmers ' benefit , regardless of the detriment to other interests . Under , the option system all traders buy whenever they sell , and sell whenever they buy , insuring their profits at each step and separating the risks of the operator from the other risks of the later processes . If " hedging " is stopped , the farmers will find that a lower price will be paid for their crops to offset the greater risk made necessary by the Senator 's method of stop- : ping gambling . There mild not be a surer way of delivering the farmers over to some financial monopoly , perhaps a " combine " of elevator buyers , than to close the exchanges .
