txt The right of the great ones of literature to take their goods wherever they find them was generally conceded even before lioLiziors casual remark in self-defense when accused of plagiarism . Such glorious refurbishing of old plots as SHAKESPEARE did has never been successfully imitated , though that is not for want of trying . But when lesser writers assume the prerogative of genius and make use of all the fish that come to their nets , other little scribblers are pretty certain to appear with claims , even if it be only on account of a tale told in the Bible or the myths of ancient Greece . Plagiarism is a difficult and delicate thing to define . It runs into intangible Interpretations ; and unless the thief can be caught with the very words of another in his pocket , like a robber with pearls , it is not easy to be sure that he has made off with an idea rightfully belonging to some one else . in fact , even If it can be proved that he has filched a thought , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that it was not the sole property of his victim ? , Perhaps it was the common property of a hundred of his contemporaries and had been bequeathed to them all by HOURS , or PETRomus , or APULEius . Such considerations have little weight when an author brings suit because another has made money with an idea . that resembles one of his . In the case which the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has just decided , GUT BOLTON has bean declared not guilty of plagiarizing the play of OSSIP Dyntow . The latter based his suit on the fact that Mr. BOLTON had read a play of his which bore some likeness to a later and successful play of Mr. Bouroirs . But the latter , " Polly Preferred , " was a variation of s. much older story than Mr. 1:1/130w 's . ' In both plays a man finds himself interested in a young and Uncouth girl , whom he remodels according to his own vision and finally loves and marries . One may suppose that Mr. BOLTON bad also read " Pygmalion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source , like Jun Wastain 's ' Daddy Long-Legs . " Then s beams of playa and stories based on the legend of man 's creation of a woman who makes his dream real  --  a custom-made wife . Mr. Box. - TON 'S play hail an original twist in that his hero incorporated his ideal in a financial sense , selling shares until the young couple had a comfortable fortune with which to start their married life . The old stories that have been used again and again , the old ideas that are capable of a new realization , belong to all the world . Sometimes a thought catches the Imagination of artists in different mediums , like the fancy of the siren , which produced a poem by RIFLING , a picture by BITRNS-SONES , and a play by PORTER EMERSON BROWNS . In the case referred to the opinion of the Court was wise as well as picturesque in saying : " This incomplete skeleton . " the two plays have in common , but " it is with real difficulty that the " flesh and blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plays , can be cut away to " show similarity- between a few " bones .
