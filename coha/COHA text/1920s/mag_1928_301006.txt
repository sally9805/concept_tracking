Rakish is Broadway 's Betty Compton . She sways in luscious curves about the stage . With a maximum of temptation she ululates the ditties of the Gershwin brothers . Friskily she tapdances . Languidly she intones between-us-girls dialog . People ogle through their binoculars , applaud mightily . Yet in 148 years no one will remember her . <P> Demure was London 's Betty Compton . Her smile was mischievous but reliable . She lived 148 years ago , but she is still remembered . Reason : Sir Joshua Reynolds painted her portrait . At the time she was 20 . She was the daughter of the 7th Earl of Northampton . Her combined hair &; wigs piled up enormously above her white brow , bright eyes , little pointed chin . She concealed her slenderness in an embonpoint of drapery , revealed the toes of her slippers . Sir Joshua painted her against an expanse of foliage . Her parents paid him about $1,050 . It meant nothing to debutante Betty . When she went home she called Sir Joshua " a pompous little man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eleven children , died at the age of 74 . <P> The portrait has always remained in the family . But last week Baron Chesham , Lady Betty 's great grandson , decided he could afford to part with it . For Manhattan 's Knoedler Galleries offered more than $500,000 on behalf of an anonymous U. S. collector , record price for a Reynolds .
