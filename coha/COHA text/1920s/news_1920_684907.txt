txt there are three situations in respect to oil that would be funny if they were not so serious . First , recently promoted oil stocks go tumbling down while oil goes bubbling upward  --  in price . Market course would therefore indicate that some oil shares have not been floated on oil , while at the time of promotion it appeared as though there was not land enough to put the oil wells on . Second , Wall Street has suddenly become frightened at the appearance of salt water in oil wells in Texas and Mexico , in blissful ignorance of the fact that every oil well is bottomed on salt water . Irast year the Potrero well of the Mexican Eagle Co. , brought up its salt water flooring , but only after it had flowed 100,000,000 barrels . The Casiano well of the Mexican Petroleum Co. is showing wet or 3% water after having produced 80,000,000 barrels of oil in 10 years . The management has looked in the well and hopes to get many million barrels oil more by letting the oil dry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells , at Ebano . It is believed that overdrilling in the adjoining Tepetate District caused several wells there to come into salt water . From the Tepetate District 80,000,000 ? barrels of oil have been taken in IS months . Third , it is not the incoming of salt water that has in the past year advanced the price of oil by more than $1 a barrel . It is the Mexican situation politically and internationally . Standard Oil a year ago made contract with the United States government to deliver fuel oil in New York Harbor at ** a barrel . Now the price is $2.25 and the Standard Oil is borrowing oil by the million barrels to make delivery . Although , the United States Government may not know it . that oil comes from Mexico . Mexican Petroleum Co. is refusing to make any further contracts beyond the 40,000,000 barrels it has promised to deliver this year . In effect the United States Government is in the position of a supplicant at the feet of Mexico begging for fuel oil which it has properly purchased upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil should be perfectly secure under every international right and contract . But Mexico spits in the face of Uncle Sam and does not even deign to make reply to communications from Washington . Nearly a year ago , the State Department made representation to Mexico City that it would insist upon the right of Amdican citizens to produce and export from Mexico the oil they owned . Again in June representations were made ; again in September and lastly in November . To date , Mr. Lansing admits that he has received no reply . But Carranza troops in Mexico have forcibly arrested drilling operations by American companies where permits have not been taken out with acknowledgement that the oil is the property of the government and not of the individual who had purchased it under the Diaz Constitution and laws of Mexico . Mexican Petroleum Co. has six rigs. ready to set up and drill in the area which it owns , the greatest oil area in the world . It owns 150,000 acres practi'cally in solid block in the oil fields to the south of its famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its clear international rights , it can for many years supply all the deficiencies - in United States oil supplies . The . ridiculous situation . is that while Mr. Lansing is talking , Mexico is not only murdering American citizens , but confiscating American properties and passing the wealth of the citizens of the United States first over to German citizens and lately over to English interests . Where territory in Mexico is owned in adjoining areas by United States interests and European interests , wells are being sunk by the European interests and adjoining land owned by citizens of the United States is made value less . European subjects can afford to drill under Mexican charters knowing that their governments will protect them . But citizens of the United States do not dare to relinquish their American rights and operate under Mexican charters because they know that experience shows that Wilson will not protect them . They must therefore sit quietly by and see the oil they own tapped off for European consumption .                @ @ @ @ @
