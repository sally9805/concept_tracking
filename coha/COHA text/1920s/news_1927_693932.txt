txt Wall Street has always evinced pronounced interest in the price at which the U. S. Steel Corp . offers stock to employes for subscription on the instalment plan . The popular opinion appears to be that it offers some clue to the probable course of Steel marketwise but all the evidence available indicates that the stock subscription price is an unreliable index of this character . The corporaton accumulates stock at any time that the officials in charge deem right . Except for the facts that they represent a large buying power and that they should be in an exceptional position to gauge the probable trend of the steel industry , they have no advantage over any other purchaser of securities . If in their opinion the course of the market for the next several months was likely to be upward they would probably buy as readily immediately after as immediately before the offering . It was not so long ago , two or three years at the outside , that a prominent director of U. S. Steel , talking to an intimate , expressed the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par as he did not believe demand for steel would justify a high rate of operations and he regarded a stock dividend as out of the question . Less than a year ago another prominent director characterized the suggestion of a stock dividend as " ridiculous . " and there is no question he was utterly sincere . All of which only goes to show that the so-called insiders do not always know everything that is going to happen and are often the poorest judges of future price mosement of their stock . IPAcT OFFERINGS After the first offering of U. S. Steel common , about the close of 1906 , at $50 a share , the stock advanced almost continuously until it reached a price of 94 " s towards the end of 1909 . The next common offering was about the end of 1910 at $70 . Throughout the greater part of 1911 the stock held well above this level , selling as high as S21-i , but receding in the late summer to around 56 Stock subscription price for 1912 was $65 and the stock advanced practically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subscription price in 1913 was $66 and the offering was followed by a recession which brought the offering price in 1914 to $57 . In the early part of 1014 the stock advanced but with the declaration of war declined rapidly until it sold as low as 38 . During the war years employes who subscribed at 85 in 1916- 107 in 1917 , and 92 in 1918 and 1919 saw a quick profit , though late in 1917 there was a sharp reaction . On the other hand the 1920 offering price of 106 represented nearly the high for that year and subscribers at 81 in 1921 also saw a shrinkage in the first few months after their purchase . Subscribers at 84 in 1922 saw the value of their investment advance almost immediately , while those who bought at 107 in 1923 saw the stock shrink to 8:51-2 before the close of the year . Subscribers at 100 in 1924 enjoyed a gain in values to 121 before the close of the year . Purchasers at 125 in 1925 faced an immediate shrinkage but the price advanced later and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , after a decline at first , has enjoyed an almost continuous rise . Offering price this year was 122 , based on the increased capital , or the equivalent of slightly over 170 for the old stock . One thing stands out clearly from all these records ; that employes who have taken advantage of the corporation 's subscription plan my have faced a temporary-shrinkage in values but those who held have reaped enormous profits . Thus , - while the records are of little assistance to the speculator they apparently may be taken advantage of by the investor . It may safely be said that the corporation ' , .. directors would not encourage employes to purchase stock at a price - which , in their opinion . did not present the probability of eventual profit . This knowledge may be of benefit to the investor .
