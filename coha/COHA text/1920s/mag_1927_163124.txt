To the triennial convention of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in Cleveland , President William B. Prenter presented a financial proposal from Mitten Management , Inc . This corporation , headed by Thomas Eugene Mitten and his son Dr. A. A. Mitten , has been remarkably successful in operating street cars , motor busses , taxicabs and a bank in Philadelphia , also a street car line in Buffalo . Their plan has been to permit employes to share in the management , investments and profits of their enterprises . <P> Their offer to the B. of L. E. was to take over the management of eleven banks and seven investment companies which the Brotherhood owns . The value of these institutions totals $89,000,000 . To this the Mittens proposed to add a " substantial amount of new capital " when they assumed management . <P> Within the Brotherhood conferences in Cleveland last week criticism developed against the Mittens ' proposal . Learning this Dr. A. A. Mitten telegraphed : " The apparent impossibility of there being a sufficiently unanimous accord of the convention in approval , prompts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn . " Said B. of L. E. President Prenter : " Other plans preferable to the Mitten project will be brought before the convention . "
