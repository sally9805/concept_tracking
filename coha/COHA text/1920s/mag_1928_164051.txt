A nightmare at this time last year to the millions who live in its lower basin , the Mississippi River is a nightmare to President Coolidge now . Last week , alarmed by reports that the Flood Control bill , which the Senate shoved through last fortnight , might cost the U. S. a billion or $1,500,000,000 , the President sent for Chairman Martin B. Madden of the House Appropriations Committee , his Flood Control spokesman . Mr. Madden was sick abed but up he got and to the White House he went . When Mr. Madden emerged from the conference he said the President was " not very happy . " He was convinced that the pending bill was a Treasury raid embracing " every proposal , like the creek that happens to be out of doors when it rains . " A veto loomed unless the House Flood Control Committee could be persuaded to restrain its generosity to the $400,000,000 or so total cost which the Administration thinks is all the U. S. Treasury can stand . <P> With Mrs. Coolidge off at Northampton , Mass. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again a White House bachelor , as he was during Mrs. Coolidge 's attack of grippe last month .
