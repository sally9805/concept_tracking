Comment on Hooverism by outstanding figures included the following : <P> Frank Orren Lowden of Illinois , farmers ' friend , recessed Republican , said he was " much impressed " by the Hoover acceptance speech , called the farm relief passages " very heartening , " but issued no endorsement of Hooverism . <P> Senator George William Norris of Nebraska , refractory Republican , said the Hoover acceptance speech " abounds in glittering generalities . . . . To me it is disappointing and unsatisfactory . . . . " <P> Senator Thomas David Schall of Minnesota , repining Republican , said : " I can not bring myself to support actively Secretary Hoover or his policies with regard to agriculture . On the other hand I can not support Smith . I am a Republican still , although I expect to be very still in this campaign . " <P> Nicholas Murray Butler , Wet Republican president of Columbia University and of the Carnegie Endowment Foundation for International Peace , the G. O. P. 's Nominee for the Vice Presidency in 1912 , sounded off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he could not put up with Nominee Hoover 's position on Peace and Prohibition . He was , he said , confident that " Literally , millions of earnest Republicans " would agree with him : <P> 1 ) That the Hoover declarations " we must and shall maintain our naval defense " and " we must not only be just ; we must be respected , " were swaggering , hypocritical , tragic . <P> 2 ) That the Hoover opposition to modifying Prohibition was based upon a mistaken notion of the meaning of " nullification . " <P> Dr. Butler cried : " If that be treason , make the most of it ! " But Dr. Butler did not say he would vote for Smith . <P> Adam McMullen , resonant Republican , Governor of Nebraska , said he was still dissatisfied with the Hoover farm-relief views . <P> William Gibbs McAdoo , Dry Democrat , said he would make " an important announcement " after Nominee Smith 's acceptance speech .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
