Chief Justice William Howard Taft last week spoke about education to members of Psi Upsilon , his Yale fraternity , who were convening in Washington . Roundly did Mr. Taft rebuke undergraduates who went to college for social reasons and those who , once there , overstressed the extracurricular . <P> Said he : " When a man grows old as I have , he then feels like resorting to profanity , as he ought not to do , at the misconception of life and the use of the universities by feather-headed young men that do n't look ahead to know the opportunities they have and to appreciate these opportunities . ... I do n't want to criticize athletics or a great many extra-curriculum duties , but I think there is a great deal of time and money wasted on these things . . . . We must get our public and private schools down to a simpler curriculum . " <P> Girard 's Day <P> Last week , many hundred alumni returned to the campus of Girard College , Philadelphia 's great school for orphans . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose motto was " To rest is to rust , " had died . Alumni , whenever they can , go back to Girard for Founder 's Day . <P> But not all the Girard alumni ambled , as they usually do , placidly and gregariously about the halls of their undergraduate years . Several seemed perturbed , some even seemed alarmed last week . What disturbed them was a rumor that their college endowment-77 millions , or eight millions less than Harvard 's ( greatest U. S. endowment ) - might fall into political hands and be spirited away . <P> Such alumni pointed to Girard Trustee Francis Shunk Brown , an attorney who has often friended Pennsylvania 's U. S. Senator-suspect William Scott Vare , and to Albert M. Greenfield , a realtor recently elected to the Board of Trustees . Realtor Greenfield has been a large contributor to Vare election funds . Trustees of Girard are elected by the Judges of the Common Pleas Court , whom Senator-suspect Vare reputedly controls . If the Judges should have occasion to elect more Vare men to be Girard trustees , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge Girard endowment ? <P> Calmer alumni pointed to Girard trustees like Lawyer Owen Josephus Roberts , whom President Coolidge chose as special Federal prosecutor in the Oil Scandals ( TIME , Feb. 25 , 1924 ) , and William H. Kingsley , a Girard alumnus . They felt sure that trustees like these would keep intact the Girard endowment , even supposing that Senator-suspect Vare might be covetous , which seemed to them impractical if not incredible . <P> Born in Bordeaux , France , Stephen Girard arrived in the U. S. as a ship 's cabin boy . At odd times he was merchant , mariner , banker . When he died he was considered one of the richest men in the U. S. Blind in his right eye from an early accident , he used , in the 1820 's , to wear his hair long , and tied into a short pigtail . Always he wore a white neckcloth and a Revolution-style coat . He left his fortune to charity and to his college . His beautiful insane wife died before him .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
