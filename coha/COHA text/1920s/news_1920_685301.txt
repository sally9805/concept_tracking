txt Five years ago this afternoon Germany perpetrated one of the most monstrous of the crimes , monumental blunders also , that revealed her aims , her methods , her standards of.internationalconduct , and ruined her at last . The story ' of the torpedoing of the Lusitania , that arch-deed of massacre , is fres : * in every mind . While civilization lasts , it can not be forgotten or , forgiven . The incredulity , honorable to human nature , with which the news was first received here ; the gathering storm of horror and wrath , the eager voices for war , the impatience with Mr. WiLsorr , who , white steadily insisting upon the rights ? of Americans on the sea , saw further than many of his countrymen  --  that page of the past seems but a record of yesterday as the mind reverts to it . There are still persons who censure Mr. WiLsox for having known more about the state of public feeling in the nation than they did , for refusing to go to war when the nation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been united . Millions of Americans , at one time probably most Americans , had believed that the United States would be able to live at peace , with something of that old instinct of insulation from foreign quarrels that had grown into a tradition . Great ' regions of the country were little informed about and ' ' had little interest in foreign affairs . The German propagandists and the German sympathizers had done their best to mislead opinion . Pacifism , as a good in itself , a sort of religion , had made too many converts . It required the cumulative effect of a ' series of German outrages against Americans here and on the high seas to convince and unify the American people . We on the seaboard were slow to understand how many shocks were needed to alter rooted prejudices and prepossessions . When . even so many scholars were . victims of the German myth , ordinary workaday folk may be pardoned for having been slow to understand Germany militant , something- so stupidly savage as to seem almost incredible even now . Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder stirred against her at last the indignation of the most phlegmatic . In 1915 Mr. WILSON knew that public opinion was not ready for war . He wisely waited until time and Germany had solidified ? it Moreover , between 1915 and 1917 ' there was a mighty growth of our wealth , our material resources , our productive energies . When the hour came , the United States was prepared , financially and industrially , to use the enormous magazines of wealth and power that she had been accumulating . The gospel of preparedness had supplanted the gospel of pacifism . On land and sea the United States was able to put forth tremendous and triumphant efforts . In the face of much sincere , if mistaken , criticism Mr. WILSON had followed the path justified by the moral and material facts . By a wise delay he saved civilization . Mr. JOSEPH . H. CHOATE , whose last years were beautiful with devotion to and labor for the cause of the Entente , admitted with characteristic magnanimity that Mr. WILSON ' S course was right .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
