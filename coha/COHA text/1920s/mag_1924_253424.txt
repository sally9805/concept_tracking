Avoiding the " mistake " which the Greek Government made in executing the Ministers alleged to be responsible for the Greek defeat at the hands of the Turks , the Bulgarian Parliament ( Sobranje ) voted amnesty to ex-Premier Vaseil Radoslavoff and his Cabinet who were charged with treason in having brought Bulgaria into the War on the side of the Central Powers . <P> ... <P> In the latter part of 1918 , the arrest of ex-Premier Radoslavoff and 13 of his Cabinet Ministers was ordered . Radoslavov and one Minister escaped to Berlin , the remaining twelve were arrested and thrown into prison . <P> In 1920 the trial began , Radoslavoff interested from afar . For one year the trial dragged on , at the end of which the Judges decided that as the Ministers were charged with wronging the people , the people ought to decide on the guilt of the accused . The people found them guilty and they were condemned last year to imprisonment for life with hard labor . Radoslavoff , in Berlin , called it laughable ; the unfortunate eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in Berlin ) saw nothing funny in the situation .
