Docket , a periodical that circulates among members of the bar , points out that Washington , D. C. , has ( in proportion to its population ) more lawyers than any state in the Union , there being one to every 181 persons there . Excepting D. C. , lawyers are most plentifully assembled on and near the Pacific Coast . Nevada ( with reason ) has a lawyer for every 337 people . California , for every 507 ; Oregon , for every 550 ; Washington , for every 606 . The lower South has fewest lawyers . And Pennsylvania has none too many , with a ratio of one to 1,285 . All the lawyers in the country added together total 122,519 . And of these New York has 18,473-more than twice the number in any other state .
