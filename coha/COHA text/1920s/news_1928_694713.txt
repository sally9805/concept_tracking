txt Through Commissioner LE BOEUF 'S report to . Governor smrrx troop figures already familiar . The first woman Secretary of State , dominating the scene . Her deputy , - who " did a.s ? he was told . " The Seven Relatives , drones all , but one : " There " is evidence that Mr. PALMER alone " rendered any service whatsoever " to the State . " Let full justice be done this ' college lad . He worked one Summer ' vacation as a laborer in the central office ; the next Summer he " occasionally washed windows , " but " chiefly drove one of the State cars far his aunt . " For that he got $2,270 ; various uncles and lesser aunts , infinitely more lightly burdened with public labors , drew ** rewards . ' The deputy 's daughter , who got $2,720 for cut . tug out maps . The assistant super ; visor. from Syracuse , .. who tore at the roots . of his memory to recall that he earned his . salary by telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman of PY .. eteryl EFFIE HOTCHKISS &; " who. " left no trace of her activities , and " so must be added to the list of " drones . " The three lady publicity agents , put on the census . payroll to write about " Home-makers inPolitics . " The Syracuse lawyer who discovered , much to his amazement , that he had been carried on the rolls as a " key-puncher " in " order to take ' care of a bill tor . services ? in an . accident case .... The =forgettable Mr. PATRICK HOGAN , who actually offered to work , but found that ? anything of the kind . would be entirely out of order , and so consented to retire gracefully with a check for 52,000 , out of the census fund , for service unrendered . Unfortunately , these are not characters in fiction , but men and women lately in the service of the State . ; Their employment under such conditions resulted in the waste , ' or worse , of hundreds of thousands of dollars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done his best to apportion the blame for it . The Legislature , the Controller , the Civil Service Commission , Mr. GLEASON , Mr. STERN  --  all come in for the censure they deserve . liven Dr. LAIDLAW , who drafted the original charges on which the inquiry was based , does not escape censure . The inner circle , those men and women who were part of the " system , " as the Commissioner calls it , whether in the office of the Secretary of State or of the Civil Service Commission , can not plead ignorance of the law . They knew what they were doing . Concocting false expense accounts and certifying to illegal payrolls strike at the roots of public integrity .. But for the conditions under which the census was conducted Mrs. ICKAPI , herself was chiefly to blame . By not putting a deputy in charge of the work , she " assumed complete responsibility for the conduct of the census . " She prevented Miss LITTLE from keeping proper accounts . She ordered her relatives placed on the payroll and paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she certified to fraudulent . travel vouchers , sometimes for phantom trips . Weighing all the evidence against her , he concludes that she was " actuated by a deliberate and " criminal intent to defraud the " State . " This imposes on the Governor the disagreeable duty of turning the case over to the . criminal authorities . Civil suits the . Commissioner brushes aside as . a waste of time and effort . There remains only the task of making constructive suggestions as to the State 's future policy , and to that he addresses himself in the concluding paragraphs of his report . If it were only a matter of an enumeration for reapportionment purposes , Mr. LE BOEUF would be content to see the job turned over to the Federal bureau , but he is impressed with the need of frequent enumerations to serve broad social purposes . His argument on that score is likely to " carry weight with Governor SMITH , who has consistently supported progressive social legislation . But Mr. LE BOEUF does not meet the point that the Federal bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supervise the conduct of an enumeration than a State agency recruited once in ten years for that purpose . There has been some talk at Washington of putting the Federal census on a five-year basis . If that were done , the case for abolishing the State census would be conclusive.
