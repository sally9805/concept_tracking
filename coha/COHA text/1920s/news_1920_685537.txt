txt The Spa conference hit both low and ? high points today . At the morning session Hugo Stinnes. the German coal baron , accused the Allies cf suffering from the disease of victory . The afternoon session brought an apoloby from the German Government for Stinnes 's behavior and thereupon M. - Minuend made the most conciliatory speech , saying the Allies , did not wish to chastise Germany but to see her a useful member of world society . The technical result of today was . a concession by the Allies to the German request that the coal situatio- be con- sidered by experts of both sides before Germany is called upon to answer the allied proposal of yesterday establishing priority for them on German coal in a large sense today showed the Spa conference in a better light than it has yet appeared , and unless Germany tries to take advantenge of the forgiving spirit showed by her conquerors this may be the beginning of a- understanding of permanent value . Late today Dr , Von Simons outlined The . German plans for reparation and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allied wishes and make their proposals first . The points to be emphasized were that the annuity should be fixed and that the total indemnity should be settled . Herr Stinnes worked out a plan whereby the Allies benefit by the increasing prosperity of Germany . Want to Keep Upper Silesia . In an interview with THE NEW YORK Talcs correspondent tonight Dr. Von Simmons said Germany wanted to make an arrangement with the Allies in regard to the total indemnity as soon as possible , but it was impossible to- determine the procedure until it was known whether Germanv would retain Upper Silesia . It will be recalled that a plebiscite is to be held to decide whether Upper ilcsia goes to Germany or to Poland . I gather that Germany will agree to pay a larger indemnity if Upper Silcsia is left to her . At the beginning , of the afternoon session Chancellor Fehrenbach apologized for Stinnes 's remarks . M. Millerand commented that if Stinnes had visited Northern France he would not have presented the plea of military necessity . He stressed the fact that Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allies had the right to take steps , but the Allies he said were not today standing entirely on literal rights . The Reparations Commission would fix the amounts of coal to be delivered only after consultation with the German experts . As for the priority clause , the French Premier said the Allies did not mean to Insist that every ton due to them should be delivered before any German needs were met . The Allies would be fair , and if at any time the Germans could prove that excessive demands were being made the Reparations Commission would rectify the matter . " We ' are not here to chastise Germany , " declared M. Minuend . " The Allies arc all agreed that Germany is a necessary and useful member of the European family , and mir desire is to help her recover if she is prepred to execute her obligations . The Spa conference proves that the Allies wish peace and not friction . " M. Millerand expressed the hope that the present German Government would remain in power . Dr. von Simons thanked M. Atillerand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government would fall because of the military agreement signed yesterday . He added that tile Germany delegation would submit their reperations proposals on Monday . He emphasized his belief that Germany really desired to carry out her obligations as far as possible and prepare the way for appeasement of the passions the war had produced . Mr. Lloyd George asked that a copy of - Germany 's plan for reparations be given to the Allies tomorrow afternoon so that it could be studied before the formal proposal on Monday . Dr. von Simons said he would endeavor to meet this request . At the opening session in the morning President Delacroix asked the Germans whether they would sign the document given them yesterday by which they asSured priority to the Allies of 29,000 , COO tons of coal yearly and the presence of an allied coal committee in Berlin to watch operations . Dr. von Simons said the Gerfnan Government felt bound to consent to the allied right to impose the coal provisions . He recognized that , generally speaking , Germany was under obligation to fulfill the treaty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , but to the fact that the Allies ' demands Were unmeetable if South Germany was to be supplied with coal also . He admitted that it was wrong for Germany to sell coal to Switzerland and Holland while in default to the Allies and promised that this should ' be stopped . But it was absolutely essential to maintain the German coal supWI- , which would be impossible if the allied - demands were met in ' full . He . - regretted that the Allies declined to hear the German experts before coming to a decision . Mr. Lloyd George replied that yesterday 's decision would permit discussion by experts at Berlin . Dr. von Simons observed that that did not help because the experts could not reduce the total , which was what Germany wanted . He continued that the German delegation had brought a plan for the economic and reparations problems which included coal . I gave an outline of this plan in my dispatch last Tuesday . Dr. Simons said that the allied refusal to confider - Germany's. obligations and , Concessions to Germany at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He declared that it the Allies should act on the supposition that delivery of coal up to the treaty amount must be made in priority of German internal supplies Germany could not accept : He asked them to hear Hugo Stinnes for the coal operators and Otto Hue , President of the German Miners Natiamal Association , for the Miners , before deciding finally . Herr Stinnes was rising when Dr. Simons halted him and said that he and Hue were not members of the delegation , and that the . German Government did . not accept responsibility ter what they might say . The Germans merely Witnted.the Allies do know the views of the two factors in coal production . Stinnes Quickly- Called to Order . ? Stinnes rose -- :it needed only one look Ea him to show him belligerent . After all ; he is the-biggest coal - owner in . Germany , and it is his coal that is being disposed of . He said ; " I rise because I want to look you all in the face . M. Millerand said yesterday that the Germans were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am right . Whoever is suffering disease of victory ? " Here Mr. Lloyd George nodded to M. Delaeroix ; who , interrupting thi Speaker said the purpose of the Spa Conference was to come to an amicable settlement and that he must insist that Stinnes be not provocative . Stinnes then went to say that Spa was the ear through which Europe would know the truth . Only through cooperation could anything be done . The Allies should realize that they must treat on . a basis of absolute equality before the conference could get anywhere . Getting to his subject , Stinnes said he could not question M. Millerand 's figures for rerance , but his ' figures for Germany were all wrong . It was not true that Germany was getting 70 per cent .. , of the pre=war amount of coal , or that ( 15 per cent . or the iron industries were working . He recognized that the coal situation was bad in France and thought Germany should help , because many French mines had been destroyed In the war . This , he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for tile reproaches that Germany was not living up to her coal promises , he recalled that even before the treaty came into effect Germany had begun deliveries . He added that he now realized this policy had , been dictated by unwarranted sentiment . Az for the allied demand that Germany should deliver 20,000,000 tons per annum , this was quite impossible .. The million tons a month now supplied could be accomplished only ! by over work . The German opEratives were asking the men to work longer , but underfeeding had made an extra effort doubtful . He recognized that the Allies might occupy the Ruhr ' ! but if they do that with those black troops as the instruments of their authority the feeling of every white man would recoil , " he shouted . If the Allies took this step the miners would refuse to work and there would be no coal . He predicted that the coal situation in Europe , which now might be straightened out in three years , would then be hopeless . He said the German mineowners had prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " right is on our side and we will not accept your terms . ' ' Herr Hue then spoke for the miners . He was milder than . Stinnes ' and created a better impression . Ho suggested that the whole matter be turned over to experts . He had examined the allied decision and believed it only made matters worse . To reach delivery of 1.000 , - 000 tons monthly the miners were working ' overtime . They Were ' now doing eight hours and ten minutes daily -- that was the limit because they agreed with the workers ' or America , England and France that six hours e ; day was best . " It all depends on the miners , " he said . " No decisions by diplomats will do any good unless the miners put them into effect . and I warn you that force or punitive measures will have the opposite effect that you hope for . " He Was sure the miners themselves wanted to help in the work of European reconstruction , but they would not cooperate in any measure that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
