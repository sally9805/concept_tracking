Into Lake Superior fled a deer . At it Winnebijou flung stones . Stones missed deer , but up sprang some islands , which centuries later White Man named Apostle Islands . The President was said to have discussed , last week , with Mrs. Coolidge the pros and cons of visiting the scene of this Chippewa legend . With newsmen , the President 's only weighty discussion concerned the Kellogg multilateral treaty . While no longer permitting newsmen to speak of him as a mere " spokesman " for himself , the President still refuses to be quoted directly , thus making it easier for him to deny anything which newsmen might have thought they heard him say . Nonetheless , the ablest newsmen of the U. S. last week were certain they understood Mr. Coolidge 's views on the treaty . This is what the President thinks : the treaty is good , but does not in any sense whatsoever constitute any reason whatsoever for the curtailment of U. S. arms in any degree or respect whatsoever . U. S. soldiers , sailors , marines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forts , gas , are purely defensive . The Kellogg treaty in no way invades a nation 's right to defend itself or to prepare to defend itself as much as it may please . " Big Navy " men were relieved . British newspapers expressed more hotly than ever their belief that the treaty was conceived in partisan politics and baptised with U. S. hypocrisy . Mrs. Coolidge shopped in Superior for a pair of bedroom slippers . One of her red ones had been chewed up by Rob Roy. * That old collie had inadvertently been left in the Brule bedroom while the Coolidge family watched a cinema on the dining room porch . Mrs. Coolidge , kind , told reporters how she had later caught Rob Roy under the bed , but had lacked the heart to chastise him with the un-chewed red slipper . <P> <P> * A month ago Columnist Heywood Broun summed up his political emotion in the sentence : " Anything to get that collie out of the White House .
