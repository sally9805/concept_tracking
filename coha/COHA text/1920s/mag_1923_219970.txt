Obstinacy . The third Marquis of Salisbury , father of Lord Robert Cecil , once made a speech at Oxford , in which he referred to his countrymen as the " English . " The speech was interrupted by loud cries of " British ! " " What aboot the Scots ! " But Salisbury went doggedly ahead and continued to say " English . " In the same spirit France continues her policy in the Ruhr . She pays no heed to the economic consequences of her occupation of Germany 's great industrial area , and , as obstinate as was the Marquis of Salisbury in saying " English , " France is obstinate in believing that she will get what she wants in the Ruhr . Opinion . Unbiased opinion does not castigate the French for wanting reparations from unwilling Germany , and it does not question the justice of their claims . Much criticism has been hurled at France over her invasion of the Ruhr , but the comment is not intrinsically pro-German . It is usually a disapproval of the French method . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected from the Ruhr ; but if she does win through , and succeeds in forcing the Hun to his knees , many voices will unite in shouting : " Vive la France ! " Policy . The damage caused to France during the war is an old story . It hardly needs repetition . The French claim that 85,750,000,000 francs worth of damage was done and say that what they want now is rep- aration for that damage and nothing more . Quite rightly they insist that if anyone is to suffer as a result of the barbaric war , it must be Germany-not France . To those who have not seen the awful horror of war this may sound shortsighted ; but when the steel wall of need intercepts the vision , no one can tell what is on the other side . Resistance . The effect of increasing the military forces in the Ruhr by 20,000 men and tightening their control in the occupied area is leading the Germans from passive to desperate resistance . Last week the Reichstag voted a credit of 400,000,000,000 marks to the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German resistance is so strong now that the French have been obliged to give more attention to running the railways than to getting coal from the pitheads.
