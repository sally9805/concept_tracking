It is the fashion nowadays for pretty musical comedy stars to step overnight into grand opera . Mary Lewis made it . So did Grace Moore . But the feat was never attempted by a cinemactress until last week when honors were awarded to Hope Hampton for her dbut as Manon with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company . <P> Unfortunately for news purposes it missed being a non-stop flight . Singer Hampton , too , had tried a turn in operetta-first in Madame Pompadour and then in My Princess . She had married profitably-one Jules Brulatour , who has sympathized generously with her operatic ambitions . There was a two years ' intensive course in singing , an advertised Boheme canceled by laryngitis . Then came the debut as Manon which won her such verdicts as " pleasing , " " promising , " and the noisy approval of some 200 guests who went from Manhattan on a special train as special guests of Husband Brulatour.
