In the wings of a theatre at Potsdam , Germany , a flossy pianist began to play . What he played was transmitted by telephone to the ears of the members of an orchestra in Berlin 17 miles away . They followed the piano on their various instruments ; what they played was transmitted to Potsdam by another telephone and then amplified so as to fill the theatre in the wings of which the flossy pianist was softly strumming . On the stage of the theatre an opera company sang to the music of the Berlin orchestra , thus successfully completing an experiment which would , Berlin officials suggested , make it possible for small opera houses in outlying districts to secure far better orchestral accompaniment than has heretofore been possible . The audience at the Potsdam opera house seemed well satisfied .
