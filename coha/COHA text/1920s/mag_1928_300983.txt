A hypothetical ape immortalized Charles Darwin ; and last week it seemed that a no less remarkable ape-a spiritual ape-might perform the same service for Stanley Baldwin , His Majesty 's Prime Minister . <P> The ape leaped into fame and being when Mr. Baldwin said , in the course of a public address : <P> " War shows us that our descent has not been only from the ape , it is also from the tiger . The tiger must be not merely apprehended but eliminated if the state is to survive . The ape in us has come through history with spiritual power . The tiger has not . That is a difference worth remembering ! " <P> While shocked or gleeful Britons were pondering these surely memorable words , good Squire Baldwin made further philosophic utterance , last week , at the 150th anniversary services in " The Little Church on City Road , " famed London nucleus of some 106,000 Methodist churches which now dot the Globe . <P> The Prime Minister , grandson of a Methodist pastor , said of John Wesley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy was his conception of practical religion for the ordinary man and woman . I believe that you can not understand America unless you understand Wesley . In America ten per cent of the people are Methodists . To Wesley Christianity was primarily a way of life . " <P> Methodists know that in the standard edition of Wesley 's Journal , he wrote about himself that , as a young man " I had no notion of inward holiness " but lived " habitually and for the most part very contentedly in some or other known sin . " Later , honest , forthright John Wesley became a High Church Episcopalian Clergyman , finally espousing Methodism . At the apogee of his potency , Pastor Wesley traveled some 5,000 miles a year , preaching and founding Methodist churches . <P> Smart reporters drew from the Prime Minister an admission that he spent spare moments , last week , reading the biography of William Randolph Hearst , enjoyed it . <P> Finally Mr. Baldwin rounded out an unusually philosophical week by addressing a banquet in celebration of the 100th anniversary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U. S. Civil War , Orator Baldwin recalled that in 1863 the Spectator alluded to : " Mr. Lincoln 's modest and somewhat vulgar but respectable statesmanship . " <P> After putting this quaint remark thoroughly through its paces , Stanley Baldwin said that in his opinion Abraham Lincoln was " one of the greatest men produced by our race .
