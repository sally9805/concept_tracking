Virginia and a baker 's dozen of other U. S. states have laws providing for the sterilization of mental defectives . Passage of such laws is difficult . Mental hygienists , sociologists , doctors were obliged to argue tactfully with diffident legislators . When doctors tried to sterilize some of the defectives appeal was made to the U. S. Supreme Court . Mr. Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes curtly quieted objections . Said he : " Three generations of imbeciles are enough . " Such laws are constitutional ( TIME , May 16 , 1927 ) . <P> In Switzerland last week the problem was handled frankly , swiftly . When a bill was offered to the cantonal legislature of Vaud that body passed it unanimously .
