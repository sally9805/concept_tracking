Similar analytical tests reveal adulteration of sweet cream and sour cream . All the tests , made by two laboratories , give evidence that impure , adulterated and illegal milk is heilfk sold over the city without hindrance from the Health Department . This committee investigated the milk supply and took samples for analysis , after information to - it , verbally and in writing , that under the HylanTammany Administration milk inspection has become lax , and that during the last six years the Health Department has done little or riothing to stop milk adulteration , nor to check the city-wide sale to the people of inferior milk not up to the requirements of the department 's own sanitary code .
