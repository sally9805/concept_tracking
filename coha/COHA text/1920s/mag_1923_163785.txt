The 116 pictures in the collection of Sir Joseph Robinson , millionaire mine operator of South Africa , brought $938,178 at Christie 's - the largest sum ever realized in a single day 's sale at the famous old London firm . The top price of $88,920 was fetched by Frans Hals ' Portrait of a Gentleman , 19 times what it cost in 1885 when it left the de Zoete collection . The Hals is 45 by 35 inches , and shows a noble standing figure with pointed beard , ruff , black costume and hat , yellow gloves . None of the pictures are likely to come to America , and in fact only about a dozen of them actually changed hands , as Sir Joseph bought the others in through agents . He is said to have had his collection in storage since 1912 , and had not seen them until they were displayed at Christie 's , when he was so delighted that he refused to give them up .
