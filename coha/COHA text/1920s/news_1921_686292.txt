txt New York State and City are to be congratulated upon the fact that the local transit troubles are to be settled before President HARDING calls the extra session of Congress . Senator Joil:Isox could not be expected to sacrifice the interests of California , even to redeem New York , by abandoning his post of duty at Washington , and he himself announces that be intends to devote the recess of Congress to the little chore . ' It is truly fortunate that the hearing on the Governor 's Traction bill is set for March 2 , for otherwise it might have been necessary to leave that interesting occasion to no better lawyers and lawmakers than New York can ' provide . It might be prudent to confine the hearing to Senator JOHNSON 'S sole argument , for it makes him angry to be interrupted by reQuests for explanations of his own record while he is attacking that of the r interests " and " powers . " Ho no doubt recalls his inaugural message as Governor in 1911 . When he is a Senator he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke as a Governor when he was Governor . In that capacity he argued that a Governor could not be expected to succeed as an ' Executive unless he was allowed to select his own Cabinet , as the President does . California was ruled by the interests , Governor Jonxsox said , because " commissions , boards and officials " were not appointive , and most of them were elective . He called the roll and said that only . the Controller should continue to be elected , for the reason that the Controller in California is a check on the other higher officials of the State , who should be appointed . That is the way Governor Ilium feels about it . He sees that the deadlock in our traction situation results f : ? - t the city elective officials ' stubborn adherence to a mandate which the election did not give them , and he proposes to get action by appointments of his own . After the Senator has convinced the Legislature that the California program fits New York 's needs the way will be clear for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud ' be admitted that the Mayor of New York is tireless in trying to have us adopt the ways of other cities in solving similar problems , instead of solving them in a way all his own . One of the first acts of his Administration was to commend the example of Boston for our adoption . But that was unfortunate , for Boston 's experience with its own way has not been happy , Then there was a proposal to import a Philadelphia expert , but that was another misadventure , Now the right expert is found  --  an expert in political methods . Such experts have no difficulty at all in finance  --  so long as they keep clear of balance sheets with red ink entries . Also , they settle 1ega1 contentions In , therprn-war  --  no long as , they keep clear of the courts . The suitability of our traction troubles for settlement by elections at some distant dates is what particularly commends it for reference to an expert like Senator Joimsorst . By , all means vote on it , unless the better way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of Governors MILLER and JOHNSON rather than that of Senator JOHNSON .
