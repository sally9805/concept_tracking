The Government protested to the Council of Ambassadors against the action of the Rhineland Commission abolishing the office of German High Commissioner for the Rhineland , held by Prince von Hatzfeld . The communication asserts that the Supreme Council created the office and recognized the Prince , and that therefore the Rhineland Commission had no power to act . <P> An interesting note in The Philadelphia Public Ledger says that Prince von Hatzfeld is half American by the " marriage of his mother , Helene Moulton , to Count Hatzfeld , later German Ambassador in London , in 1863 . " Prince Hatzfeld acquired his present title plus Serene Highness through the death of an uncle , " and his two sisters moved up a stage in the court hierarchy and enrolled themselves in the second section of the Gotha ( German Who 's Who ) among members of the reigning families by espousing Princes Friedrich Karl and Max Hohenlohe , thereby obtaining the privilege of addressing royalty as ' lieber vetter ' with the familiar ' du ' .
