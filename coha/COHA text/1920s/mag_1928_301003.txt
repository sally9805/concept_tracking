The People elected last week the 71st Congress of the United States , but the first meeting of this Congress does not occur until December , 1929 , unless President Hoover should call a special session , which , he indicated might conceivably be necessary to deal with the farm problem . In order to elect this Congress it was necessary for the People to choose 435 members ( all ) of the House of Representatives , and 36 out of the 96 members of the Senate . This the People apparently accomplished , as the Election did not bring forth any controversy such as surrounded the election of Pennsylvania 's Vare in 1926 . In doing so the People gave to President Hoover an unmistakably clear Republican majority in both House and Senate . During the Coolidge administration , the House has always been solidly Republican , but the Senate has teetered , owing to the fact that a bare Republican majority included half a dozen insurgents who could not be relied upon to support party measures . <P> The Senate of the present ( 70th ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these only 13 had to be replaced either by re-election or election of successors . Of these , all were re-elected or Republicanly replaced . <P> The present Senate contains 46 Democrats . Of these , 20 had to be replaced . And of these , 8 were replaced by Republicans and not by Democrats . <P> Thus , the 71st Senate may contain ( barring death ) 56 Republicans , 38 Democrats , as well as the lone Farmer-Laborite Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota , who was reelected . Also , one vacancy ( Vare ) . <P> The following individual triumphs were notable either for the contest or the personality involved : <P> Theodore Elijah Burton , 77 most famed and revered of all active Ohio Statesmen , strong of voice , quick to action . He has been in the Senate before . And both before and after his previous Senatorial term he served as Congressman , being thereby unique in U. S. history . <P> Phillips Lee Goldsborongh was Republican Governor in the pre-Ritchie era . Last week he defeated bumbling Senator Bruce . The Goldsborough name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is even more elect than the great name of Carroll . Another Goldsborough , this one a Democratic cousin of the Senator-elect , was re-elected to the House . <P> But in Delaware , a name which has been in the U. S. Senate for a century was defeated by Republican John G. Townsend . The defeated name was Bayard , - in this generation carried notably by extremely tall Thomas Francis . <P> And in that other small state Rhode Island , another name went down , for Peter Goelet Gerry , extremely rich and extremely active supporter of the Brown Derby failed of re-election to the Senate because Felix Hebert , a Dry Republican defeated him . <P> To carry on the tradition of Walcott service to the state and of the State 's contribution to the U. S. Senate , Connecticut proudly elected Frederic C. Walcott , of old Yale and Republican ancestry . <P> Robert Marion La Follette , 33 , was , of course , re-elected in Wisconsin , much to the satisfaction of his mother , Belle , able widow and onetime helpmate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
