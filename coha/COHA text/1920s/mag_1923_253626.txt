SCIENCE <P> The Story of a Complete Civilization Is Being Recovered <P> Archaeology is booming as it never boomed before . Not less than 20 expeditions in every quarter of the globe are digging to unearth new treasuries of human culture . American brains and capital are backing many of these . <P> Nearly equal in importance with the Egyptian discoveries are the new findings in Yucatan . The civilization of the Maya race , covering at various times a large part of the Yucatan peninsula , Guatemala , Salvador and northern Honduras , has been known for over half a century by archaeologists to have reached the highest level of culture of any of the ancient peoples of the New World . It is thought to have begun about the first century before Christ , reaching its zenith from 400-600 A. D. , and to have flourished at intervals until about 1400 A. D. The Spaniards found these sites depopulated . Epidemics of yellow fever and other tropical diseases are believed to have caused the decline and fall of this great people . <P> For ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , and Dr. Herbert J. Spinden , of Harvard , have been exploring the little-known ruins . Now a well-organized group of scientists and engineers , including Dr. Morley , John F. Barry , William Barclay Parsons , Dr. Marshall H. Saville of Columbia and Dr. John C. Merriam , president of the Carnegie Institution , is surveying the field preliminary to a more exhaustive explor ation . Restoration and preservation of the astonishing Mayan architecture is the prime task in view . <P> The chief centers of the Mayas , now attracting public interest , are Chichen Itza , Uxmal and Mayapan , forming a league which ruled Yucatan about 1000-1300 A. D. At Uxmal is the House of the Governor 330 feet long , the most imposing building of the region . At Chichen Itza are a pyramidal castle 130 feet high ; temples to Kukulkan , the chief Maya divinity ; a civic center two miles long , surrounded by several square miles of massive buildings , terraces , etc. ; a large enclosed court in which a game like basketball was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King " of the Mayas ; a sacred well , 150 feet across and 70 feet deep , used by the Maya religious cults . In the mud at the bottom of this well have been found human skeletons - the most beautiful maidens were hurled to death here at annual festivals to propitiate the rain gods - and extraordinary relics of jade , mosaics , pottery , weapons , balls of copal- offerings brought to this Mecca by pilgrims from all over the Mayan world . <P> The best collection of these relics in the United States is at the Peabody Museum , Boston . At its height the Mayan race probably numbered several million people , and the population of Chichen Itza was about 500,000 . Their decorative arts show exquisite workmanship . Astronomy and mathematics were highly developed . They had an elaborate picture writing , much of which has been deciphered , giving the clue to many dates in inscriptions and chronicles . Their calendar was the most complex and exact known in the ancient world , with a century of 52 years , and a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
