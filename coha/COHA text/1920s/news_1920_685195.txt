txt Opinion is divided among bankers and foreign exchange men as to the direct cause of the latest advance in sterling . Some bankers say the strong financial position of Great Britain is reflected in the rising quotations . They point out that England 's exports are now running nearly at normal pre-war rate . and that more goods at higher ocean freight rates are being carried in English bottoms than ever before . They also say that the gold shipments from London to New York further indicate the strong financial position of Great Britain . Other authorities on the subject say the display of strength has been greatly exaggerated . In their opinion the technical position of the market is unchanged . Some maintain that banks and commercial houses have been short of sterling since that exchange went above $3.50 , and that the present buying movement is nothing more than covering of shorts . One banker who is bearish on sterling thinks England is shipping gold here simply because of the psychological effect it has upon the market . To his knowledge , two corporations who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards of directors upon hearing of the gold shipments from London . In both cases , he says , the directors decided to cover immediately . He believes there are a great many other such cases , and attributes the recent strength in sterling to these short coverings . Other bankers point to , the Anglo-French Loan and the United States Treasury advances , which together amount to nearly $5.000,000.000 , as a negative argument on the possibility of English exchange getting near parity for some time to come . These bankers state that Great Britain can not continue to ship gold here , in any substantial amounts , without , seriously depleting her own gold reserve and it is doubtful whether she would undertake such a stop . With regard to the huge indebtedness of England to the United States . some hankers venture the opinion ' that the time is near when Great Britain 's exports will far surpass her imports and then she will he in a position to retire a large portion of her foreign debt . The fact remains , however , that the gold imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sterling market .

In this. no little credit is given the British bankers , who , local ' . authorities admit , arc past masters in handling a difficult exchange situation . Their propaganda in this case has worked well . It is better for the British Treasury to sell'Aerling bills in a $4.00 market than in one nearer $3.00 , &en; at the cost of a little gold reserve . But it is not believed here that the British Treasury will attempt to carry sterling much higher for the present , and that they will be satisfied if they can keep the rate at about the present level under the circumstances ; Another thing that has contributed to the strength of sterling is the announcement that the British Treasury is again accumulating American securities on the other side .
