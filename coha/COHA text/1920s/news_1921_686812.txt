txt Although Britain 's miners have been back at work for a month it is doubtful if many of them appreciate the extent of the beating they received in the recent strike . Incidentally , many British business men do not comprehend the significance of the settlement by which the " miners ' holiday " was ended . Removals of restrictions in the use of gas , of limitations in railway schedules and so forth during July bore full witness to the resumption of mining operations . Probably all such restrictions have /Sow been removed , or nearly so . Before the middle of July , for instance , railway schedules were being restored rapidly to normal . Those who did not experience in person the inconveniences caused by the strike would not gather a comprehensive understanding of it from the news dispatches . Service , which normally had been hourly , . was reduced to three or four trains a day .

In some cities use of gas for household purposes was limited to four hours a day of which 214,2 hours was in the morning . WEE Pt ' Mae TMITEFtM 1 N ED But despite all the annoyances , great and petty , suffered during the strike , the placid British public was adamant in its attitude . As a Scotch " Bobby " remarked to a chance acquaintance on a train : " Them miners has got to be beat " . And , " beat " they were ; but it took three months , thanks to the vacillation of an administration fully aware of the terrific business loss to the country in the prolongation of the strike but nevertheless with an eye on the main chance . The drones among the British miners are in for a jolt as result of the wage settlement and a stiff one . Probably a month 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Heretofore. as the strength of a chain has been de-. termined by that of its weakest link , so that results of a miner 's efforts have been measured by those of the least energetic . In the agreement concluded a month ago the value of individual effort has been recognized , though the fact of its being recognized seems to have escaped general observation . After allowing for a certain scale of wages and a small percentage to the mine owner , the agreement provides that up to of the amount of the wages paid the profits shall be divided 83% among the workmen and 17C'e to the employer . rttont7t.riviric BENEFITS WORK. , 1 EN In a normal coal market the amount of profits to be so divided between miners and owners will he dependent on the energy of the former and will vary in direct ratio thereto . A preponderance of slothful workers at any property would mean little or nothing to be disbursed on the 83%-17C ; - , basis . To such miners would be paid probably nothing more than weekly wage fixed ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater the energy of the bulk of the workmen the more reasonable the expectation of earnings so to be split in this profit-sharing scheme . Consequently the interest of the workmen , individually and collectively , should lie in the direction of great productive effort warranting the hope of division of surplus earnings to augment the fixed earnings or wages granted them . On the face of it this means placing a premium on energy and a discount on laziness . Every miner should realize that the inactivity of the lazy workmen who seeks to do a minimum of work is a drain on the capital of every other worker  --  that is , his labor . Hence not only is there no incentive to tolerate the lazy man but there is a selfish , personal reason for viewing him with disfavor and of either converting him to greater industry or of ousting him from his opportunity to act as a brake on the wheels of the intelligent workman 's progress . Whether the miners ' leaders were cognizant of the possibilities of this clause in the agreement is doubtful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least productive of the group was the leaders ' standard of measurement .

Hi opportunity is set forth in the contract signed , sealed and delivered . It is on the basis of this phase of the miners ' agreement that important business men in the United Kingdom view the terms with satisfaction . In their opinion it heralds a new era in the history of British coal mining which should result in raising output per man and in reducing cost of production . Between 70% and 80% of the cost of producing British coal is paid to the miner . Average production of coal in Britain accredited to persons above and below ground is only about 195 tons a year .

Without the great British shipping industry raw materials would not have been brought here to be converted into manufactured goods for distribution over the wide world . Those students " of business here who have studied intensively the new wage agreement with the miners are most hopeful of the future of the coal industry and coal export business of Great . Britain . Cheap coal is the most important cog in the British world trade machine . And when the significance of the feature of this wage contract referred to above is better realized , they predict it will come to be regarded as the most significant development in the British coal industry in decades .
