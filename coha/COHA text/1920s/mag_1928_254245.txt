If you happened to walk down the west side of Fifth Avenue , between 42nd and 40th streets , Manhattan , on almost any summer day of recent years likely as not you were the object of a penetrating glance from a young woman standing on the steps of the New York Public Library . Having glanced , she probably made a mark in the notebook she held in her hand . She may have noted the color of your stockings , the cut of your suit , the length of your skirt , the shape of your hat . You had become a statistic . <P> Last week , the results of many a year of statistic-gathering were told 60 students at the fashion clinic of the Amos Parrish Co. in the Savoy Plaza Hotel , Manhattan . Among the 60 were managers of fashionable shops , buyers , stylists , representatives of a mail order house ( Montgomery , Ward &; Co. ) , reporters ( The Chicago Tribune , New York Daily News ) . Each wanted to penetrate the mystery of fashion . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adroitly , experts of Amos <P> Parrish &; Co. * revealed their discoveries , as follows : <P> Fashions move in cycles , can be predicted . <P> Fashions are of two types , experimental and accepted . Experimental fashions , observable at the opera and expensive restaurants , are dangerous for the prudent shopper . Accepted fashions show themselves on the street , in good but inexpensive restaurants . <P> The day of the old buyer is passing , that of the stylist beginning . But not all expensive stores are abreast of the merchandizing times . Leaders among fashion-conscious shops are Macy 's ( Manhattan department store ) , Woolworth 's ( 5-and-10 cent chain stores ) . <P> Not all fashions have to do with clothes . Clear and significant are present-day fashions in : <P> Beards . It is fashionable to be cleanshaven . <P> Jewelry . Men wear little jewelry , rarely display stickpins , rings . <P> Watches . Thin , with gold or platinum dials . <P> <P> * Among them : Dr. Paul Henry Nystrom , professor of marketing at Columbia University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion analyst .
