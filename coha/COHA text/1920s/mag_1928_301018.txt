Young Love . She was the little girl who got wet in Orphans of the Storm and wore an arresting white dress in Nell Gwynne . That has nothing to do with a play called Young Love which opened in Manhattan last week , except that Dorothy Gish , 30 , is back on the stage playing opposite her husband , James Rennie , and Lillian Gish is still in the movies and still unmarried ( see p. 44 ) . <P> Dorothy Gish is cast in Young Love as a tempestuous and idealistic latter-day maiden striving to assure marital congeniality by pre-nuptial experiment . In the first few lines , she and her fianc express satisfaction with last night 's trial . To make it doubly sure , they exchange partners with their unconsulted host and hostess . Miss Gish completes an affair with host , but fianc quails before hostess . Then follow two acts of confessions , recriminations , door-slammings , to end with four-way felicity the way it should be ( according to the movies ) . Despite such items as " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason not to marry him , " despite Miss Gish 's grotesque make-up and quaintly haphazard clothes , Young Love is adequate entertainment . <P> Americana . The U. S. has many peculiarities , some of them absurd . Among the latter , it would appear , are business conventions , talkies , the beds in railroad cars , Chicago schools , the faces of taxi-drivers , women temperance addicts , Will Hays , subways , Roxy 's cinemansion , and Gene Tunney . All of these , J. P. McEvoy , who wrote Show Girl , snubs with villainous though somewhat protracted gaiety in this speedy second edition of his famed revue . <P> Revues also have many peculiarities , some of them absurd . Among the latter are somewhat naked chorus girls , most burlesques of Strange Interlude , Frankie and Johnny contortionists , and the later works of Roger Wolfe Kahn . These J. P. McEvoy does not snub . <P> The Unknown Warrior . Paul Raynal , who fought in French trenches , wrote the play and it was presented four years ago at the Comdie Franais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been played all over Europe , to great cheers in Germany , and the approval of Bernard Shaw in London . Last week Charles Hopkins , who now has a small theatre of his own in which to produce the plays he likes , unveiled it for Manhattan . <P> The universal respect for the play abroad contrasted with the reactions which it induced in Manhattan theatre-goers . Something was the matter with the performance ; partly , it seemed , the acting , partly the direction . A French soldier returns home on leave ; his fiance , who has been living at his father 's home , no longer loves the soldier but she conceals this fact until after she has spent the night with him . In the morning , the soldier 's father berates his son for a seduction ; whereat the soldier berates in his father selfish and truculent senescence which so blatantly permits the young to die . <P> The three characters are intended as symbols and the play is a fiercely lyrical analysis of horror . But , last week , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed .
