txt It is to be hoped that Senator KING of Utah speaks only for himself when he says that there will be no union between the Republicans and Democrats on Secretary MELLON 'S plan for reducing taxation . Senator WALsx of Massachusetts showed the path of wisdom , safety and pitriotism when he said the question " is not a partisan " one Let us get together with a de " mend , whole-hearted and in a non " partisan spirit , to reduce downward " and sharply the tax burden of the " American people  --  and above all , let " us do it at once . " To do otherwise , to be afraid that the Republican Party may get too much credit ? in other words , to imitate the mean and narrow partisanship of the Republicans in 1919 ? is to oppose the preponderant , the overwhelming desire of the American people . To refuse to co-operate in a plan to check the bleeding of the pockets and the business of the country is , considered from the mere point of partisan prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They know how to punish those who , from petty and mistaken notions of political advantage , prevent the cure . Senator ICI-Nu , to be sure , says that the Democrats will have their own plan , aiming at reductions greater than those proposed by Mr. MELLON . Apparently he thinks , the Democrats must have their own project . Public sentiment has already approved Mr. MELLoisr 's . Mr. KING agrees to the lowering of the rates on small and moderate incomes and the abolition of the nuisance taxes . But he joins the La Follettians in advocating an excess profit tax and higher inheritance taxes on great estates . We recommend to his attention these remarks of a Democratic newspaper , The Atlanta Constitution : The La Follettes of the Senate  --  and there are quite a few La Follettes also in the House  --  are determined , if they can , to not only fight any plan to reduce Federal taxes , as has been outlined as feasible by Secretary MELLoN , but to actually impose further tax burdens upon the savings of the thrifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . He is inviting the Democratic Party to disaster .
