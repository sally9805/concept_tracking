( No sooner had the Armistice been signed , than there followed , not simply a rebound , hot a collapse , which no one who lived through it will ever forget . Swiftly , tragically . the high mood of sacrifice yielded to a ruthless selfishness , and the solidarity won by the scar was lost , together with most of the idealism that had stood the stress and terror of it . The moral demobilization was terrifying , the disillusionment appalling . Men lard lived a generation in five years ; and instead of a new world of which they had dreamed , they found themselves in a world embittered , confused , cynical , gray with grief , if not cracked to its foundations  --  all the old envies working their malign intent . Such a chaos offered free play to every vile and slimy influence , making the earth an auditorium for every hoarse and bitter voice that could make itself heard . It was a time of social irritation , moral reaction , and spiritual fatigue , almost more trying than the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys had stopped . 01,1 jealousies and new envies began to make themselves felt ? among them a very emphatic anti-American feeling ; a reminiscence , in part , of the impatience at our delay in entering the war , joined with suspicion of our wealth and power . The same was true in America , in its feeling toward England and the other Allies . Mrs. A. Burnett-Smith ? ' Annie S. Swan ' ? in her admirable book , America at Home , tells how fine and warm the feeling in America was before the Armistice , and how quickly it changed : ' There was a reaction , of which was born a coolness , a new , subtle hostility , which one could sense everywhere . ' Her book , I may add , is one of the few of its kind that never fails of that fineness of feeling which should always exist between kindred peoples . Her observations are interesting , her comments frank but kindly , and the whole book is informed with a charming and sympathetic personality . As Mr. W. L. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love our enemies , it at least taught us to hate our allies . ) November 20 , 1918 . ? For one who has set great . store by the cooperation of English-speaking peoples , the new anti-American propaganda is like a personal bereavement . The feeling in England with regard to America is certainly , as the Scotch would say , ' on the north side of friendly , ' and manifests itself in many petty , nagging ways . To read the London papers now , one would think that America , and not Germany , had been the enemy of England in the war . Every kind of gibe , slur , and sneer is used to poison the public mind against America . My mail at the City Temple has become almost unreadable . It takes the familiar forms ? among the upper classes an insufferably patronizing and contemptuous attitude toward America and all things American ; among the lower classes an ignorant The middle classes-are not much influenced by it , perhaps because , as Emerson said , America is a middle-class country ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This feeling against America is confined , for the most part , to England , ? it hardly exists in Scotland or in Wales , ? and , like the anti-British feeling in America , it is a fruitful field for the venal press and the stupid demagogue . Naturally , a journal like John Bull ? leader of the gutter-press ? is in its glory ; but even in the better class of papers one reads nasty flings at America and its President . As for the Morning Post , no one expects anything other than its usual pose of supercilious condescension and savage satire , and it is at its brilliant worst . Six weeks ago we were regarded as friends ; to-day our country is the target of ridicule as clever as it is brutal . No doubt it is mostly nerves ? a part of the inevitable reaction ? and will pass away ; but it is none the less a tragedy . November 22 . ? It is nothing short of a calamity that in this ugly hour of reaction and revenge there is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , no demand for it . But to those who can see beneath the surface , there is a deeper meaning . Three months ago Arthur Henderson said : ' If we have a national election in Britain , you will not get a Wilson peace . ' I did not realize at the time what he meant ; but I can now say to him , ' Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet . ' There is to be a khaki election , such as Chamberlain had following the Boer War , the better to coin into political capital all the anger , suspicion , resentment , and disillusionment burning in the public mind . In other words , it is a deliberate scheme of the Prime Minister ? or a group of strong men who use him as a tool ? to mobilize the least admirable elements of England , ? not the great , noble England , but . a reactionary , imperialistic England , ? and have them in solid phalanx behind the Peace Conference . And in the mood of the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the world which no one can predict . Reaction in England will mean reaction elsewhere , if not everywhere . November N. ? Nothing was left hazy after the speech of the Premier in Westminster Hall , launching his Coalition campaign . It was a skillful speech , intimating that even the Throne may be in danger , and playing upon the fears and hates of men . He wants a Parliament he said , in which there shall be no op. position , ? no criticism , no discussion , ? and this proposal to prostitute Parliament was greeted with applause . There is protest in the Liberal press ; but men in the street and train give each other the knowing look and the approving nod , praising ' the Little Welsh Wizard . ' It is called a ' Coupon Election , ' since each Coalition candidate must have the indorsement of the Prime Minister , and the food-coupon is the most detestable thing in the public mind . Sir George Younger toaster brewer of the kingdom ? is the organ . izer and wire-puller of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both the author and the hero of the most re . markable blood-and-thunder moving-picture show in political history ; what the papers call ' The Victory Film , nr How I Won the War . ' He goes to and fro , shrieking two slogans . First , hue ; the Kaiser ! Second , twenty-five thousand million pounds indemnity ! What sublime statesmanship ! Behind this smoke-screen of rhetoric and revenge the most sinister forces are busy ; and the trick will work . Liberals and Laborites are unable to unite . Even if they should unite , they could not stem the tide . Two things are as plain as if they were written upon the wall . First , the President is defeated before he sails : and second , if the war is won , the peace is lost . November 20 : ? Once again opinion is sharply divided as to the motives and purposes of the Prime Minister . tip some he is held ' to be a messiah , by others a light-minded mountebank . Still others think he is only a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or group of men , he meets . Obviously he is none of these things , but merely an opportunist , without any principle or policy , ? except to retain power , ? feeling his way to get all he can . The story is that , walking in the House of Parliament with a friend the other day , he suddenly stopped , tapped his breast , and said : ' I sometimes wonder if this is Lloyd George . ' His wonder is shared by millions of people . Certainly it is not the Lloyd George we used to know , who had the light of morning in his eyes . Limehouse is far in the distance . The fiery champion of justice for the Boers is a pathetic memory . The man who defied the vested interests of England in behalf of the poor , the aged , the disinherited , is a ghost . There is another Lloyd George , so new and strange that he does not know himself . With his personality , his power of speech , his political acumen , which almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he has turned back . It is one of the greatest , failures of leadership in our lime . November 28 . ? Often one is tempted to think that the Labor Movement is the most Christian thing on this island . In its leadership , at least , it is spiritually minded ; its leaders , as I have come to know them , being sincere , earnest , honest men who have worked their way up from the bottom , or else have been drawn into the Movement by the opportunity for service . Not all of them are so minded , but the outstanding leaders and spokesmen of the Movement ? who , unfortunately , are in advance of the rank and file ? are men of a type unknown , or nearly so , in American labor . Henderson , Thomas , Snowden , Webb , MacDonald , Clynes , and the rest , make a goodly group . Henderson is a lay preacher ; so is Thomas . As for Robert Smillie , I do not know what his religious affiliations , if any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keir Hardie , and that his relentless idealism is matched by the nobility of his character . Tall , gaunt , stooped , his face reveals the harsh attrition. of earlier years ; but his smile is kindly , and his eyes have in them the light of an unconquerable will . He helps one to know what Lincoln must have been like . In this campaign the leaders of Labor are almost the only keepers of the nobler idealism of England , and their programme is essentially Christian . Alas , they have a heavy weight of inertia to carry , and one wonders if they can fire the apathetic mass , fatalistically submissive to its lot , and suspicious of anyone who tries to alter it . November 29 . ? Anyway , I am having the time of my life , going to every sort of political meeting and listening to every sort of speech . It is a big show and a continuous performance . The best address I have heard , so far , was delivered by a Methodist preacher at a Labor meeting in Kingsway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the mark . The campaign makes me first sick , and then homesick ; it is so like our way of doing it . That is , all except the hecklers . They are so quick and keen of retort . Also , the English can beat us at mud-slinging . It is humiliating to admit it , but it is so . We are amateurs in abusing the government ; but we are young yet , and longer practice will no doubt give us greater skill . How like our elections is the hubbub and hysteria of it all . Mr. Asquith told me how he made a speech on world-affairs , and one of his audience said : What we want to know is , are we going to get a pier for our boats ! ' Always the local grievance clouds the larger issue . How familiar it is , as if a man went out , and encountered in the street what he thought for the moment was himself . Men , otherwise sane , seem to lose their senses in a political campaign . Statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging the scorn of man and the judgment of heaven . 0 Democracy ! ( As soon as it was known that the President was to attend the Peace Conference in person , the Tory papers in London began subtly and skillfully to paint a caricature of him in the public mind . He was described as a kind of Hamlet , living aloof in the cloisters of the White House ; a visionary companioned by abstractions ; a thinking-machine so cold that one could skate all round him , having as good a heart as can be made out of brains , ' ? ' not a man at all , but a bundle of formula , ' ? and , finally , by the Morning Post , as ' a political Moody and Sankey ' coming to convert Europe to his gospel of internationalism , ' which it described as a ' disease . ' Such was the reactionary attitude toward the man who made the only constructive suggestion seeking to prevent the ' collective suicide ' of war . But only a small part of the British press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good feeling . The Times ? by virtue , no doubt , of its position , not only as a journal , but as an institution ? secured from the President a memorable interview , in which he was shown to be actually and attractively human ; and , further , that he had no intention of demanding the sinking of the British Fleet . The President arrived in London the day after Christmas , and the greeting accorded him by the English people was astonishingly hearty and enthusiastic . Their curiosity to see the man whose words had rung in their ears , expressing what so many hoped but so few were able to say , joined with their desire to pay homage to the first President of our Republic who had set foot on English soil . His visit was taken to be a gesture of goodwill , and I have never seen anything like the way in which he captured the English people . He swept them off their feet . For a brief time his marvelous personality , his ' magic of the necessary word , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate of the island . No man in our history could have represented us more brilliantly . In Buckingham Palace as the guest of the King , in the old Guildhall as a guest of the City , at the luncheon in the Mansion House , his words were not a mere formal , diplomatic response , but real in their unaffected simplicity , and as appropriate as they were eloquent . On the Sabbath , instead of going with the King to worship at St. Paul 's , he went to the little Nonconformist Chapel at Carlisle , where his mother hail been a girl , and his grandfather the minister . Ills brief talk in the old pulpit was a gem , and it touched the people deeply . At the Mansion House luncheon we heard the news of the election returns ? the result having been delayed in order to get the report of the soldier vote . ) December 28 . ? So the President has come and gone , and the Prime Minister has learned what was in his Christmas stocking . It is a blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such stakes as he can win at the Peace Table . lie divined aright the bitter mood and temper of the hour . It is a Tory victory by a trick , the Liberal Party having been asphyxiated , if not destroyed ; and it remains to be seen whether it can he resuscitated . Mr. Asquith was defeated ; Mr. Bottomley was elected ! In America that would be equal to the defeat of Elihu Root and the election of Hearst and would be deemed a disaster . So the Prime Minister gets what he wanted ? a Parliament tied , hamstrung , without moral mandate , three quarters of its members having accepted the coupon ; and of the remainder , the largest party consists of seventy Sinn Echo 's who are either in prisons or pledged not to sit in the House . It is a Parliament in which there will be no effective opposition , the Labor Party being insignificant and badly led . The Prime Minister gets what he wants , but at the sacrifice of the noblest tradition in British history . Labor is sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dogma of Direct Action ; and , if it is soi the Prime Minister will have ne one to blame but himself . Such is the effect of a trick election , the tragedy of which grows as its meaning is revealed . ( The reference to Mr. Bottomley no to him personally , though I hate the things for which he stands . When it was announced that I had accepted the invitation to the City Temple , I received a long cablegram from Mr. 13ottomley , suggesting that I write for his paper , John Bull , and telling of his admiration for Dr. Parker . Unfortunately , as I did not choose to be introduced to England through such is medium , I could not accept his invitation . Often ? especially after my protest against the increase of brewery supplies ? he wrote cruel things about me . It did not matter ; I should have been much more unhappy if he had written in my praise . He is the captain of the most dangerous and disintegrating elements in Britain , ? the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheap music-hall , and the nether side of the sporting world . With incite and copious emotions , he champions the cause of the poor , with ready tears for ruined girls ? preferably if the story of their ruin will smack a little smuttily in his paper . Since the Armistice , his office has been the poison-factory and centre of anti-American propaganda , and in playing upon the tears and hates and prejudices of people , he is a master . Alas , we are only too familiar with his type on this side of the sea . ) January 4 , 1919 . ? Joined a group to-day noon , to discuss the problem of Christian union , by which they seemed to mean Church union ? a very different thing . But it was only talk . Men are not ready for it , and the time is not ripe . Nor can it be hastened , as my friend the Bishop of Manchester thought when he proposed some spectacular dramatization of the Will to Fellowship during the war . Still less will it come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it is artificial , it will be superficial . It must come spiritually and spontaneously , else it will be a union , not of the Church , but of the churchyard . Dicker and deal suggest a horse-trade . No , our fathers parted in passion ; in passion we must come together . It must be a union , not of compromise , but of comprehension . If all the churches were made one to-day , what difference would it make ? Little , if any . Something deeper and more drastic is needed . As the Elizabethan Renaissance was moralized by the advent of Puritanism , and the reaction from the French Revolution was followed by the Evangelical Revival , so , by a like rhythm , the new age into which we are entering will be quickened , in some unpredictable way , by a renewal of religion . Then , perhaps , on a tide of new life , we may be drawn together in some form of union . In this country no union is possible with a State Church , sinless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders to the wall . So far from being a national church , the Anglican communion is only a tiny sect on one end of the island . Its claim to a monopoly of apostolicity is not amenable to the law of gravitation ? since it rests upon nothing , no one can knock away its foundations . Just now we arc importuned to accept the ' historic episcopacy ' for the sake of regularity , as if regularity were more important than reality . Even the Free Churches have failed to federate , and one is not sorry to have it so , remembering the lines of an old Wiltshire love-song which I heard the other day : January N. ? Alas ! affairs on the lovely but unhappy island of Ireland seem to go from bad to worse , adding another irritation to a shell-shocked world . From a distance the Irish issue is simple enough , but near at hand it is a sad tangle , complicated by immemorial racial and religious rancors , and , what is sadder still , by a seemingly hopeless incompatibility of temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , and apparently can not , understand each other . It looks like the old problem of what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object . Besides , the friction is not only between Ireland and England , but between two Irelands ? different in race , religion , and economic organization . If Ireland could be divided , as Lincoln divided Virginia , the riddle would be solved . But no Irishman will agree . The English people , as I talk with them about Ireland , are as much bewildered by it as anybody else . They do feel hurt at the attitude of South Ireland during the war , and I confess I can not chide them for it . Ireland was exempted from conscription , from rationing , from nearly all the hardships of a war which , had it been lost , would have meant the enslavement of Ireland , as well as the rest of the world . A distinguished journalist told me that his own Yorkshire relatives were forced into Irish regiments by politicians , to make it appear that Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was hostile seaboard . It required seventy-five thousand men to keep order in Ireland , and that , too , at a time when every man was needed at the front . Ulster , in the meantime , did magnificently in the war , and it would be a base treachery to coerce it to leave the United Kingdom .. Ulster may be dour and relentless , but it has rights which must be respected . Yet , if England does not find a way out of the Irish muddle , she may imperil the peace of the world . So the matter stands , like the Mark Twain story in which he got the hero and heroine into so intricate a tangle that he gave it up , and ended by offering a prize to anyone who could get them out of it . January 14 . ? To-day a distinguished London minister told me a story about the President , for which he vouches . He had it from the late Sylvester Horne , ? Member of Parliament and minister of Whitefield 's Chapel , ? who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his high office . Home happened to be in IN LONDON America ? where he was always a welcome guest ? before the war , shortly after the President was inaueurated , and he called at the White House to pay his respects . In the course of the talk , he expressed satisfaction that the relations between England and America would be in safe hands while the President was in office . The President said nothing , and Home wondered at it . Finally he forced the issue , putting it as a question point-blank . The President said , addressing him in the familiar language of religious fellowship , ' Brother Horne , one of the greatest calamities that has befallen mankind will come during my term of office . It will conic from Germany . Go home and settle the Irish question , and there will be no doubt as to where America will stand . ' How strange , how tragic , if having kept America out of the war for more than two years , ? since nearly all Irishmen are in the party of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace , and defeat , or at least indefinitely postpone , the organization of an effective league of nations ! Yet such may be the price we must pay for the wrongs of olden time , by virtue of the law whereby the sins of the fat hers are visited upon generation after generation . Naturally the English people do not understand our urgent interest in the problem of Ireland , not knowing how it meddles in our affairs , poisoning the springs of good-will , and thwarting the cooperation between English-speaking peoples upon which so much depends . ? January 16 . ? At the London Poetry Society ? which has made me one of its vice-presidents ? one meets many interesting artists , as well as those who are trying to sing the Everlasting Song in these discordant days ? Masefield , Noyes , Newbolt , Yeats , Mackereth , to name but a few , with an occasional glimpse of Hardy . Nor do I forget May Donor , a little daughter of St. Francis , walking The Way of Wonder . A reading of poetry by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his golden voice as for his interpretative insight . The plea of Mackereth , some time ago , for poetry as a spiritual teacher and social healer , was memorable , appealing to the Spirit of Song to bring back to hearts grown bitter and dark the warmth and guidance of vision . The first time I heard of Mackereth was from a British officer as we stood ankle-deep in soppy mud in a Flanders trench . If only we could have a League of Poets there would be hope of a gentler , better world , and they surely could not make a worse mess of it than the practical ' area have made . If the image in the minds of the poets of to-day is a prophecy of to-morrow , we may yet hope for a world where pity and joy walk the old , worn human road , and ' Beauty passes with the sun on her wings . ' January 19 . ? The Peace Conference opened with imposing ceremony at Versailles yesterday , and now we shall see what we shall see . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the world to rights . Just why a pessimist was not included is hard to know , but no doubt there will be pessimists a-plenty before the job is done . Clemeneeau is a man of action , Lloyd George a man of transaction , and what Ithal of a man the President is , in negotiations of this nature , remains to be revealed . The atmosphere is unfavorable to calm deliberation and just appraisetrent . The reshaping of the world outof-hand , to the quieting of all causes of discord , is humanly impossible . Together Britain and America would be irresistible if they were agreed , and if they were ready for a brave , large gesture of world-service ? but they are not ready . America had only enough of the war to make it mad and not enough to subdue it ; Britain had enough to make it hitter . As a penalty of having no axe to grind , America will have to bear the odium of insisting upon sound principlesand telling unpalatable truths , and so may not come off well . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the terms of the Armistice will be made a ' scrap of paper , ' and whether there is to be a league of peace or a new balance of power ? a new imperialism for the old . Meanwhile , all ears will be glued to the keyhole , straining to hear even a whisper of ' open covenants , openly arrived at . ' January 30 . ? On my way back from Scotland I broke my journey at Leicester , to preach in the church of Robert Hall ? the Pork-Pie Church , as they call it , because of its circular shape . In the evening I lectured on Lincoln . Leicester , I remembered , had been the home of William Carey , and I went to see his little Harvey Lane Church , where he dreamed his great dream and struggled with drunken deacons . Just across the narrow street is the red-brick cottage where he lived , teaching a few pupils and working at his cobbler 's bench to eke out a living . It is now a Missionary Museum , preserved as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ceiling so low that I could hardly stand erect . There , in his little back-shop , ? with its bench and tools , like those Carey used , ? a great man worked . Pegging away , he nevertheless kept a map of the world on the opposite wall of his shop , dreaming the while of world-conquest for Christ . There , too , he thought out that mighty sermon which took its text from Isaiah 54 : 2 , 3 , and had two points : Expect great things from God ; attempt great things for God . No other sermon of that period ? 1792 ? had only two points , and none ever had a finer challenge to the faith of Christian men . We need the vision of Carey in this broken world to-day , that so , however humble our lot , we may learn to think in world-terms ? in terms , that is , of one humanity and one Christianity . I felt myself standing at the fountain-head of that river of God whirls will yet make this war-ridden earth blossom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailbag entails an enormous amount of labor , bringing almost a hundred letters a week ; but it is endlessly interesting . There are letters of all kinds ? a series from Manchester proving that the world is hollow and that we live on the inside ? and from everywhere : China , India , France , America , and all over Britain . If an American says a naughty thing about Britain , a copy of it is sent to me , underlined . If it is the other way round , I am not allowed to forget it . There are letters from ministers whose faith has been shaken , and from others who want to go to America ; pitiful letters from shell-shocked boys in hospitals ; letters from bereaved parents and widowed girls ? heroic , appealing , heart-breaking , like that from an old woman in the north of England whose life of sorrow was crowned by the loss of her two grandsons ' in the war . In closing she said : ' Me youth is gone , me hope is dead , me heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To which I could only reply that , though God had taken everything else , in leaving her a love of righteousness He had left her the best gift He had . As nearly all the City Temple sermons and prayers are published , both hearers and readers write to agree or disagree , or , more often , to relate difficulties of faith or duty . The mail-bag is thus an index to the varying moods of the time in respect to matters of faith , and I learn more from it than I am able to teach others . Every time a sermon has to do with Christ , it is sure to be followed by a shower of letters , ask- IN LONDON ing that the subject be carried further . In spite of the agitations of the world , ? perhaps because of them , ? What think ye of Christ ? remains the most absorbing and fascinating of all gues. tions . Somehow , in spite of my practice for the last ten years , I have always had a shrinking feeling about writing and printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexed and weary folk are helped by them , I relent . Public prayer , of course , is different from private devotion ; it is individual , indeed , but representative and symbolic , too . One speaks for many , some of whom are dumb of soul , and if one can help others to pray , it is worth while . Yesterday , in the Authors ' Club , a man took me aside and told me this story . He was an officer invalided out of the service , having been wounded and smitten with fever in the Mesopotamian campaign . He took from his pocket a tiny book , ? it looked like a notebook , ? saying that it contained the bread , the meat , the milk , all that had kept his soul alive on the long marches and the weary waits in the hospitals . I thought it was , perhaps , a copy of the New Testament , or the Imitation of Christ ; but , on opening it , I found ten of my little prayers cut from the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on , even against it shrinking I can not define . April 16 . ? The hearings of the British Coal Commission , in the King 's Robing-Room , some of which I have attended , look and sound like a social judgment-day . Never , I dare say , has England seen such pitiless publicity on the lives of the workers , the fabulous profits of the owners , ? running up as high as 147 per cent , ? and the ' rigging ' of the public . It is like a searchlight suddenly turned on . No wonder the country stands aghast . Nothing could surpass the patience , the marage , the relentless politeness of Robert who conducts the case for the tunnies . He has had all England on dress-parade ? lords , dukes , and nobles ? while he examined them as to the titles to their holdings . They were swift and often witty in their replies , but it mots much that they had to come when summoned by a miner . They were bored and surly , but they humbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and though their lordships may have a brief success in the King 's Robing-Room , they are in fact already defeated ? ; rod they know it .

Orchard is its Bernard Shaw , and W. G. l'eek its Chesterton . At first , it was thought to be only a protest against the ungracious barrenness of Nonconformist worship , in behalf of rhythm , color , and symbolism . But it is more than that . It seeks to unite personal religious experience with its corporate and symbolical expression , thus blending two things too often held apart . As between Anglicans and Nonconformists , it discovers the higher unity of things which do not differ , seeking the largeness of Christ in Whose radiance there is room for every type of experience and expression . It lays emphasis on fellowship , since no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it alone . Also , by reinterpreting and extending the sacramental principle , and at the same time disinfecting it of magic , the Free Cat holicism may give new impetus to all creative social endeavor . For years it has been observed that many ultra-high Churchmen ? for example , Bishop Gore , who is one of the noblest characters in modern Christianity ? have been leaders in the social interpretation of Christianity . Perhaps , at last , we shall learn that it was not the Church , but Humanity , with which Jesus identified Himself when He said : " Phis is my body broken for you . ' The great thing about Christianity is that no one can tell what it will do next . June 2 . ? Have been down in Wales for a day or two , lecturing on Lincoln , and also feeling the pulse of the public sentiment . I found it beating quick and hot .

When I see the hovels in which the miners live , ? squalid huts , more like pig-pens than human homes , ? I do not wonder at the unrest of the people , but at their infinite patience . Physical and moral decay are inevitable , and the spiritual life is like a fourth dimension . I asked a Labor leader what it is that is holding things toget her , and he replied : ' All that holds now is the fact that these men went to Sunday School in the churches and chapels of Wales years ago ; nothing else restrains them . ' Thus a religious sense of the common good , of communal obligation , holds , when all other ties give way . But the churches and chapels are empty today , and in the new generation what will avert the ' emancipated , atheistic , international democracy , ' so long predicted ? Religion must do something more than restrain and conserve : it must create and construct . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be in a deeper insight into the nature and meaning of religion as a social reality , as well as a private mysticism . This at least is plain : the individual and the social gospel belong together , and neither will long survive the shipwreck of the other . Never , this side of heaven , do I expect to hear such singing as I heard in Wales ! June 16 . ? Henry James said that three marks distinguish London ? her size , her parks , and her ' magnificent mystification . ' To know the mystification one needs to spend a night ? cool , moonless , and windy ? on top of St. Paul 's Cathedral . After climbing as many steps as there are days in the year , and a journey through devious diagonals , we emerge by a tiny door leading to the Golden Gallery , three hundred feet above the sleeping city . Sounds as they ascend are isolated and identifiable , even when softened by distance or teased by the wind . Fleet Street , westward , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side of a volcano , where blackness swallows up everything else . The bridges play at criss-cross with lamp . reflections in the river . The clock-tower of Westminster , like a moon and a half , shines dimly , and the railway signals at Cannon Street Station look like stars of the under-world ? crimson , emerald , amber . By half-past three a sky , mottled with heavy clouds , begins to sift them into planes and fills the breaks with the sort of light that is rather darkness visible . ' Slowly the pall over the city , half mist and half smoke , ? the same ' presumptuous smoake ' of Evelyn 's day , ? begins to drift sullenly with the wind , like a gas-attack . An hour ago the lamplights made everything seem ghostly ; now the ghostliness is theirs . Presently , out of a sea of slate , Wren 's steeples rise like gaunt spectres , with an air compounded of amazement and composure . The last thing to take shape is the Cathedral itself ; first the gilt Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Dome still broods in darkness . As we watch , the campaniles and the statues below turn from alabaster to ivory . Squadrons of clouds float in an atmosphere that is turning from gray to pearl , and front pearl to gold , like the rosy amorini in a Venetian altar-piece . Be river is astir with barges , and early trams sprinkle grains of humanity about the thoroughfares . Camden Town crawls back under its pall of industrial smoke . At last the city , in all its infm. itude of detail , is revealed , nod the mystification of the night gives was h , the day with sovran eye .

With appalling Clarity we are beginning to see how little we gained by the war , and how much eve lost . Instead of a world worthy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bate moral collapse , revolutionary influenza , industrial chaos , and an orgy of extrava. gance . In politics , in business , in social life , things are done which would bate excited horror and disgust in MB One recalls the lines of Chesterton writ . ten after the landslide election of 1906 : Nothing is more terrible than the moral let-down all about us , unless it is the ease and haste with which a wild and forgetful world has proved false to the vows it swore in its hour of terror . Yesterday a London magistrate mid that half the crime in the kingdom is bigamy . Reticences and modesties seem to have been thrown overboard to an accompaniment of the jazz dance , which has become a symbol of the mood of the hour . Often it has been said that man is the modest sex , but I never be . lieved it until now . Young girls between fifteen and twenty-two are unmanageable , and imitate the manners of mute . sans . Working for good wages , they are independent of their parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at the slightest restraint they leave home . In broad daylight the public parks are scenes of such unspeakable vulgarity that one is grateful for the protection of garden walls . Who can estimate the injury done by this loosening of the moral bonds , this letting down of the bars to the brute ? Those who speak of war as a purifier of morals are masters of a Satanic satire ! September 12 . ? These are days when anything may happen . Having lived for live years in an atmosphere of violence , men are irritable , and riots break out on the slightest pretext . Many fear that the history of a century ago , when Peterloo followed Waterloo , may repeat itself . Nobody is satisfied with the result of the Peace Conference ? sorriest of sequels to a victory won by solidarity and sacrifice . Some think the treaty too hard , some too soft , and all wonder how it can be enforced without sowing the seeds of other wars . The Covenant of the League is criticized as keenly here as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal venom displayed at home . It is felt that , if the nations hold together , the Covenant can be amended and the treaty revised and made workable as need requires ; but if they pull apart , the case is hopeless . What is happening in America is hard to make out , except that , under cover of a poison-gas attack on the President , all the elements that opposed the war including ncluding the whole hyphenated contingent ? have formed a coalition of hatreds to destroy him . At the Peace Conference he was the victim of a vendetta by men of his own country who , for partisan purposes , tried to stab their own President id the back at the very moment when he was negotiating a treaty of peace in a foreign land ! Not VOL es ? . O. 4 // unnaturally the attitude of the Senate is interpreted on this side as a repudiation of the war by America . ' You came late and go early ; having helped to put out the fire , you leave us to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder they feel bitter , and this feeling is fanned by the anti-American fanatics , whose organized propaganda ? something new in England ? has been so active since the Armistice . No doubt it is provoked in part by the stupid anti-British propaganda in America , with other elements added , the while sinister forces are busy in behalf of estrangement between two peoples who should be , not only friends , but fellow workers for the common good . ( An unhappy example of this feeling , which marred the closing weeks of my ministry , was an alleged interview ' which appeared in the Daily News , purporting to come from me . It made me use words remote from my thought , in a spirit foreign to my nature ; and the result was an impression so alien to my spirit , and so untrue to the facts , as to be grotesque . Such words as these were put into my mouth : ' I have come reluctantly to the opinion that an American minister can not really succeed in England . There is something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not define it that seems to prevent complete agreement and sympathy between the two . There exists a body of opinion amongst the middle men in the ministry and the churches that objects to the permanent settlement of American preachers in this country . ' All of which was manufactured so far as I was concerned , however true it may be to English opinion . When the man who did it was asked for his reason , he said that he wished to keep American ministers from coming to England . ' Of course , it will take more than that to keep us from going to England , ? though I dam say it will be many a day before an American accepts an English pastorate , ? but the incident illustrates the state of mind almost a year after the Armistice . Unfortunately that feeling still exists , and it makes an exchange of pulpits difficult for Americans who have any national self-respect . However , by patience and mutual regard this irritation may be overcome in the morning of a fairer , clearer day . ) October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple to-night . The Temple was full , with many standing in the aisles . His subject was ' The Structure of the Atom , ' and he spoke for more than an hour , holding his audience in breathless interest Even the children present heard and understood , as if it had been a fairy-story . Indeed , it was more fascinating than a fairy-story ? his illustrations were so simple , so vivid . As a work of art , the lecture was a rare feat . If only the men of the pulpit could deal with the great themes of faith ? surely not more abstract than the structure of the atom ? with the same simplicity a nd lucidity , how different it would be ! Tall , well-formed , his dome-like head reminding one of the pictures of Tennyson , the lecturer was good to look at , good to hear ; and the total impression of his lecture was an overwhelming sense of the reality of the Unseen . He made only one reference to psychical studies , and that was to warn people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , ? since spiritualism is not spirituality , ? not to make such matters a religion . This advice came with the greater weight from the man who more than all others , perhaps , has lifted such investigations to the dignity of a new science . October 12 . ? Mr. Asquith , Lord Robert Cecil , Mr. Clyncs , and Premier Venizelos of Greece , all on the same platform , speaking in behalf of the League of Nations ! Such was the bill of fare at the Mansion House , to which was added ? for me ? a spicy little chat with Mrs. Asquith , most baffling of women . She is lightning and fragrance all mixed up with a smile , and the lightning never strikes twice in the same place . Mr. Asquith read his address ? as he has been wont to do since he first became Prime Minister ? in 0 style as lucid as sunlight and as colorless : a deliberate and weighty address , more like a judicial opinion than an oration , yet with an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was a handicap , for he is a very effective speaker when he lets hinwilf go . Lord Robert ? tall , stooped , with centuries of British culture written in his face ? was never more eloquent in his wisdom and earnestness ; told one heard in his grave and simple words the finer mind of England . If only ho were more militant , as he would be but for too keen a sense of humor . He has the spiritual quality which one misses so much in the statesmanship of our Inc ? I shall never be happy until he is Prime Minister ! Venizelos was winning . graceful , impressive ; and in a brief talk that I had with him afterward , he spoke with warm appreciation of the nobility and high-mindedness of the President . He has the brightest eyes I have seen since William James went away . Without the moral greatness of Masartik , or the Christian vision of Smuts , he is one of the most interesting personalities of our time and one of its ablest mon . October 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is most needed ! It is appalling ! Without him reaction will run riot . Though wounded in a terrify-Mg manner , he still holds the front-line trench of the moral idealism of the world ! Whatever his faults at home , ? his errors of judgment or his limitations of temperament , ? in his world-vision he saw straight ; and he made the only proposal looking toward a common wind organized in the service of the common good . Nothing can rob him of that honor . If our people at home had only known the sinister agencies with whirl ' he had to contend , ? how all the militarists of Europe werennobilized against him at Paris , ? they would see that his achievement , while falling below Ins ideal , as all mortal achievements do , was nothing short of stupendous . Those who know the scene from this side have an honorable pride in the President ; and though his fight should cost him his life , when the story is finally told he gill stand alongside another who went the way of dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He falls where a bravo man should fall , at the front , as much a casualty of the war as any soldier who fell in Flanders or the Argonne . November 11 . ? Sunday evening , the Oth , was my last service as the Minister of the City Temple , and the sermon had for its text Revelation 3 : 14 ? " Nese things saith the Amen . ' It was an effort to interpret that old , familiar , haunting word , ? the Amen of God to the aspiration of man , and the Amen of man to the way and will of God , ? seeking to make vivid that vision which sees through the shadows , and affirms , not that all is well , nor yet that all is ill , bat that all shall be well when God both made the pile complete . ' Its mess/go was that , when humanity sees what has been the Eternal Purpose frosts the beginning , and the ' far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves , ' the last word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise , the final note of the great world-song . To-day , at noon , all over the Empire , everything paused for two minutes , in memory of the dead . The City Temple was open and many people gathered for that moment of silent , high remembrance ; and that hushed moment was my farewell to the great white pulpit , and to a ministry wrought in the name of Jesus in behalf of goodwill ? speaking with stammering voice those truths which will still be eloquent when all the noises of to-day have followed the feet that made them , into Silence . November 12 . ? To-night the National Council of the Brotherhood Movement , which gave me so warns a welcome in 1916 , tendered me a parting dinner ? an hour which I can neither describe nor forget . Dr. Clifford ? a veteran soldier in the wars of God ? presided , and his presence was a benediction . Looking back over my three years and a half in London , I can truly say that , though I did not want to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , I do not regret that I slid come ? save for the scenes of horror and suffering , which I pray God to be able to forget . Nor do I regret leaving , though my ministry has been a triumph from the beginning , in spite of many errors of my own added to the terrible conditions under which it was wrought . As long as I live I shall carry in my heart the faces of my dear friends in England , and especially the love and loyalty of the people of the City Temple ? the memory of their kindness is like sacramental wine in the Cup of Everlasting Things . Perhaps , on the other side of the sea , because I now know the spirit and point of view of both peoples , I may he able to help forward the great friendship . November 14 . ? Hung in my memory are many pictures of the beauty-spots of this Blessed Island : glens in the Highlands of Scotland ; the banks and braes o ' bonny Doon ' ; stately old cathedrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holy things of life ; the towers and domes of Oxford ; Stoke Poges on a still summer day ; the roses of Westcliff ; the downs of Wiltshire , where Walton went a-fishing and Herbert preached the gospel ? and practised it , too ; Rottingdean-on-the-Sea ; scenes of the Shakespeare country ? the church , the theatre , the winding Avon ; the old Quaker Meeting-house in Buckinghamshire , where Penn and Pennington sleep ; the mountains of North Wales ; great , gray London , its all its myriad moods : London in the fog , the mist , the rain ; London by moonlight ; the old , rambling city whose charm gathers and grows , weaving a spell which one can neither define nor escape ; London from Primrose Hill on a clear , frosty day ; London from the dome of St. Paul 's ; London from the Savoy in October , seen through a lattice of falling leaves , while a soft haze hangs over the River of Years . It is said that , if one lives in London five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am leaving it just in time !
