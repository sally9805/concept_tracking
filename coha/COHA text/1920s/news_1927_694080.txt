There was no crowd , auditor some time the police had notiiiiiki to do except to keep the regular- morning stream of workers from lingering in City Hall Plaza on their way to work . A cordon of uniformed men was thrown around the park from Broadway to Park Row and from Chambers Street to the Federal building . Later , when the crowd began to gather , no one was allowed to pass through the police lines without a ticket . By the time the fliers arrived at the City Hall , the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schedule . About 12:15 o'clock , the vanguard of the parade , consisting of a row of mounted police , arrived at the City Hall amid applause from the crowd . The threatening weather had caused the program to be speeded up , and the procession was about fifteen minutes ahead of schedule . Clouds now darkened the sun , and a few drops of rain fell . The regular army troops , sailors and some marines swung through the Plaza at a rapid gait , with snappy salutes for Mayor Walker in the reviewing stand . They were followed by National Guard and Naval Militia contingents , with bands . The Mayor , with the entire reviewing party of army and navy officers , consular officials , members of the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen , and heads of city departments , took their places in the stand as the vanguard of the parade arrived . Preceded and followed  --  in fact , entirely surrounded  --  by mounted and motorcycle policemen , the automobile bearing the fliers and their escorts arrived at the reviewing stand about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drizzle , and it began to force some of the daintily dressed women in Summer finery to flee from the open grandstand . Others put up umbrellas and stayed . Along the top row photographers and moving picture men , in their shirt sleeves , were grinding out pictures without bothering about the rain . Cheers Greet the Fliers . The crowd cheered and applauded as Commander Byrd , spick and span in his white naval uniform , stepped out of the first car with Grover A. Whalen , Chairman of the Mayor 's Committee . They mounted the steps to the reviewing stand , followed by the other aviators , each receiving a cheer and applause as he stepped from his car .

Although the drizzle continued , it was not very bad at this time , and many persons came down from the stands , and got through the police lines from Broadway in one way or another , pressing as closely as possible to the reviewing stand to get a good look at the fliers . While the cameras clicked and moving picture machines kept grinding , Mr. Whalen presented the fliers to Mayor Walker one by one  --  Byrd first , next Chamberlin , and then Noville , Acosta and Balchen . Facing the crowd , the fliers displayed different reactions in accordance with their temperaments . Commander Byrd was composed , wellpoised , gracious . Chamberlin blushed , acting nervous and embarrassed . Noville was genial and smiling broadly . Acosta blinked and laughed gayly . Balchen reminded one of Lindbergh in his boyish attitude , half shy , half nonchalant . The crowd applauded them all warmly . Whalen Presents the Fliers . In presenting the aviators to Mayor Walker , Mr. Whalen said : Mayor Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of American aviators whose deeds of courage and scientific skill have just forged a new link which binds this greelt 1:1011t 91 NM York to alas ? of the sister lands across the broad Atlantic , France and Germany . Mr. Mayor , already it has been our privilege to greet the hero whom it is my pleasure now to present to you , Commander Richard E. Byrd. 2 he last time you welcomed him back his journey was over the top of the world , the first man on earth to fly over the North Pole . Today , your Honor , I present him to you with blushing fresh honors , the Commander of the transatlantic monoplane America , which , with a record flying load of 14,746 pounds , including his brave crew of three , flew from New York to Paris and who , baffled of his goal by tempests , icy cold and fog , landed safely in the sea that beats upon the breast of France at Versur-Mer . And now , sir , may I present to you Mr. Clarence Chamberlin , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monoplane Columbia for 3,923 miles safely across the Atlantic Ocean . He has won for the United States the honor of being the first aviator in the history of the world to fly from New York to Germany , thus forming another friendly link with our Teutonic brethren , and he has also the distinction of being the first birdman to transport a passenger in the person of Charles A. Levine across the Atlantic Ocean . The gentleman I now present to you is Lieutenant George 0 . Neville , assistant pilot and flight engineer of the America , who , as a flying ace in the World War , won imperishable honor for the bravery of his offensive against the enemy front . This gentleman has won in his flight for peace no less renown than for his deeds of war . Lieutenant Noville . And now , sir , the last two remaining members of the America 's crew , Captain Bertram Acosta , one of the pioneer American aviators , a winner of the Pultizer Aviation Trophy , and holder of the world 's record for continuous flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes and 25 seconds . The last of the crew is Lieutenant Bernt Balchen , who resigned from the navy of Norway to become an American citizen and who , in the land of his adoption , has aided with his great courage in adding lustre to the Stars and Stripes under which now it is his proud privilege to live . This , sir , is the last but not the least of the crew of the America . Mayor Distributes Citations . Having shaken hands and exchanged greetings with each of the aviators in turn , as they were presented , the Mayor then distributed c ' ations with the city 's Medals for Valor to the fliers . On behalf of the Mayor , Hector Fuller of the Merchants ' Association , first read the citations . For Commander Byrd and the members of his crew there were four identic citations , reading as follows : CITATION . It is my pleasant duty as Mayor of New York City to present to you the medal of valor which you have so courageously won by your part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now famous Wanamaker transatlantic monoplane America . In thus awarding you this distinction , in the name of the millions of our citizens , we are mindful of the extraordinary heroism of your deed and of the marked contribution your intrepid flight has made to the scientific data of aeronautics . May this , the city 's medal , stand to you as a perpetual reminder that the city from which you took flight will ever realize the enormity of the task you essayed ; the dangers and the difficulties you so bravely overcame . Fighting against the fury of the winds ; battling against the freezing cold that might well have struck terror to hearts less brave , and penetrating , blindly but with an abiding faith the almost impenetralle fogs , you fought the good fight  --  for science and the glory of America  --  until you landed at last in the beating surf that washed the shores of France at Ver-sur-Mer . It is this record  --  without parallel in the world history of aviation  --  that this medal of valor of the City of New York is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of all our citizens , As-Oliet-Exlelltblex , . haTje the 110 ; 10.1 ! to affix my name , and the seal of the city which honors you . JAMES J. WALKER , Mayor , City of New York . Citation for Chamberlin . As Mr. Fuller finished reading , Mayor Walker pinned the medal on Commander Byrd 's coat . Mr. Fuller next read the citation for Chamberlin , as follows : This citation , accompanied by the medal of valor of the City of New York , I , the Mayor of New York City , have the honor of presenting to you , Clarence D. Chamberlin , in recognition of your heroic non-stop flight in the monoplane Columbia from the shores of this city to Eisleben , Germany . By this flight , in which you had the honor of being the first to transport a passenger across the Atlantic and in which you established a new world 's record for sustained flight-3,923 miles  --  you have placed your name on that roll of heroes who have placed America in the forefront of the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of all our citizens for whom it is my honor to act ; and to this citation which we hope may prove a never-to-be-forgotten reminder of your brave deed , I have the pleasure of affixing my name as Chief Executive and placing thereon the seal of this city of New York . JAMES J. WALKER . Mayor , City of New York . After pinning the medal on Chamberlin 's coat the Mayor went right ahead and pinned medals on Noville , Acosta and Balchen , in that order , dispensing with the reading of the citations in their cases because of the rain , which was now gradually getting worse . The Mayor 's Address . Cutting short his formal address of welcome because of the weather the Mayor said : Commander Byrd , Mr. Chamberlin , Distinguished Crew , Mr. Chairman and Ladies and Gentlemen : It seems but a few days since these stands around the City Hall were taken down after the reception to Colonel Lindbergh , and now in that short space of time of necessity they are replaced in the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day will not permit of any observation of length , but notwithstanding the weather the Mayor feels it his obligation on behalf of the people of the City of New York to pay the heartiest kind of a welcome that he is capable of to these heroes who are with us today . Their skill and their courage , foresight , scientific resourcefulness , have well been established . They have conquered the forces of nature . They have conquered time in that they have turned weeks into days , and days into hours . They have conquered space , in that they have brought the peoples of the world more closely together . They have conquered the admiration of all the civilized world for America and Americans . It is a peculiar thing today in this great cosmopolitan centre that the five distinguished heroes who stand on this platform are all American citizens , yet each has sprung from a different country . You will leave here and go to the Eternal Light , that imperishable shrine to those who have made the supreme sacrifice , that imperishable shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York . There our people will foregather and with them at that shrine will be those who made the great , the supreme sacrifice in the cause of aviation . I know that the spirit of Noel Davis , of Nungesser and Coli , of the crew of the Shenandoah , and I know , gentlemen , that a former distinguished Mayor , who for the cause of aviation made the supreme sacrifice , will he there in the spirit of John Purroy Mitchel . You will find the outpouring of the world . You will find a happy , a proud New York , both here and at that eternal shrine . Again may the congratulations of the city be reiterated in the justification , or rather the vindication , of the hope and the courage and the foresight and the vision of those who have gone before . New York is proud today in this opportunity to welcome these American heroes back to their homes and to their country . No sooner tad Commander Exrd J1 ? J stepped forward to begin his address than the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove hundreds of persons from the stands , almost emptying them . Some took refuge on the City H11 steps by running through the inner police lines , but the police turned back the others , who then ran for the subway entrances or near-by buildings . Commander Byrd spoke as follows : It seems to me that wherever I go I take the rain and the storms with me . I think you are all very great heroes to wait here in the rain to hear our talks . This is the second time within thirteen months that I find myself having the pleasant duty of thanking the greatest city in the world for her hospitality and open-armed welcome as only she can give . Naturally , my shipmates and I are greatly moved and deeply and humbly appreciative . We went through a great deal in preparation and execution of our project , and your complete and interested understanding has been far more than we had any right to expect . That we owe to pour great press , which has been with us from the beginning in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that we are proud to share your reception with Clarence Chamberlin , a gallant flier whose feat we think is unexcelled in the history of aviation . I take my hat off to him . If we were not with him here , we would be out in front with the crowd to help honor him . I want to say a word about my shipmates , Noville , Acosta and Balchen . They are the salt of the earth . I selected them because I thought they were the best I could find . In no case was I disappointed . They expected no glory , there were no prizes awaiting them , they risked their lives for the progress of aviation , and when the great moment came they still functioned smoothly and efficiently and faced calmly the disaster that seemed certain . I felt very keenly the responsibility for their lives . But I was proud of them , for I saw that they had a heart for any fate . A Word for Floyd Bennett . We must not forget Floyd Bennett at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost sacrificed his life to the cause of this flight . We are very grateful to Mr. Rodman Wanamaker for giving us the opportunity . The crossing of the Atlantic to France had been his dream for many years . A word about France . We have exactly the same message to bring that Lindbergh did  --  that everywhere we went we got greetings of France for America . We had , I believe , one of the toughest battles in the air , and the French appreciated it , and our own people could not have been happier over our safety than they were . Our reception was spontaneous . From the highest to the lowest there were words of generous praise and affection , but no words were necessary , for wherever we went there were crowds to greet us , and the expressions of joy and pleasure on the faces of their greatest statesmen and humblest citizens were from their hearts and more eloquent than any words could have been . They were greeting in us the people of America . They gave us their very best and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment were America and the pinpricks can not hurt when we know the heart of France . Chamberlin 's remarks follow : It is always an effort for me to say anything after Commander Byrd gets through , because he does it so well , and I am such a contrast . . All I would like to say is that we attended receptions in the neighborhood of thirty cities in Europe , but none were as large as this . However , they all displayed about the same enthusiasm , and it refleets the opinion or the thought of the people of Europe for the people of America . I want to thank you . By this time the rain had subsided , and the men in what was left of the crowd bared their heads as I Miss Erna Cern sang " The StarSpangled Banner . " The procession then started uptown for the ceremonies at the Eternal Light about 1 o'clock , a half hour ahead of : schedule ,                  @ @ @
