W E are not as a rule much concerned about , the possible workings of any official mind , but just at the moment it would be of more than ordinary interest to know what Secretary Stimson was thinking of when he injected the Paris peace pact , and with it the diplomatic reputation of the United States , into the Russo-Chinese imbroglio in Manchuria . One would have supposed , for example , that he would have taken pains to verify down to the ground the facts about the situation in Manchuria , instead of going off half-cocked about a matter regarding which he could only say that he was " credibly informed . " If the Department of State did not know whether the Russian military operations were offensive or defensive , or how the negotiations for a settlement stood between Russia and China , its intelligence service is beneath contempt , but even so it was only a part of the day 's work for Mr. Stimson to know where he was likely to land before taking his theatrical leap into space . If Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case in court he would also , it may be assumed , have gone beyond the obvious facts and taken account of the fundamental conditions from which they sprang . One wonders if he did anything of the kind in preparation for waving the peace pact . It would be interesting to know whether he had in mind the political history of the Chinese Eastern and South Manchuria railways , or realized the magnitude of Japan 's financial interest in Manchuria , or understood even afar off the deep irritation which the presence of the Japanese in Manchuria occasions in the Chinese mind . It would be superfluous to suggest , but for what has happened , that the question of the stability of the Chinese Nationalist Government was one to be carefully weighed , that Japan might not applaud a pronouncement affecting a controversy in which it was the most interested third party , and that Russia might resent advice from a Power which for years , with its hand on its heart , has stubbornly refused the least measure of diplomatic recognition to the Soviet regime . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counted for anything with Mr. Stimson . He represented a government which likes to think of itself as both powerful and pure , and the times summoned him to a holy task . The stunning rebuff which he received from Moscow was not a whit beyond what his blithe performance deserved . In a note which is a masterpiece of rejoinder , he was reminded that the seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the Nationalist Government was illegal , which it was ; that the Russian military operations were in self-defense and " in no wise " a violation of " any obligations under the Paris pact " ; that the American note was sent " at a moment when the Soviet and Mukden governments already had agreed to several conditions , and were proceeding with direct negotiations which would make possible prompt settlement of the conflict between the Soviet Union and China , " and that in view of these facts the American declaration " can not but be considered unjustifiable pressure on the negotiations and can not , therefore , be taken as a friendly act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and good manners , the Russian Government went on to express the opinion that the peace pact " does not give any single state or group of states the function " of acting as its protector , and expressed " amazement that the Government of the United States , which by its own will has no official relations with the Soviet , deems it possible to apply to it with advice and counsel . " The only reply that Mr. Stimson could make to this castigation ( the Russians are uncannily expert when it comes to getting their opponents on the hip ) was to inform the Washington correspondents with uncommon energy that he had " seen the text of the Russian memorandum as reported in the press , " that his note was not sent from " unfriendly motives " but because the United States intended to square its conduct with the obligations of the peace pact , and that the negotiations which were in progress " show that the public opinion of the world is a live factor which can be promptly mobilized and which has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controversies which may arise between nations . " We pass over Mr. Stimson 's calm assumption that the " live factor " of world opinion which his note " mobilized " was responsible for negotiations which began before mobilization appeared . Mr. Stimson obviously felt hurt , and he is welcome to any balm that will ease his pain . The more important thing is to observe how matters stand now that Mr. Stimson , official protagonist of peace and good advice , has had his fling and returned to the silence from which he so ill-advisedly emerged . If Mr. Stimson really felt that the peace of the world was threatened by the events in Manchuria , and that resort to the Paris pact was the only way to prevent an equivocal peace from becoming an embodied war , we are disposed to credit him with good intentions . If he also felt that the Paris pact , not being self-executing , required action by one or more of the signatory Powers to give it effect , he felt only what nobody will dispute . What Mr. Stimson failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the law must do so with clean hands if their appeal is to be respected . A nation which , as Mr. Hoover has just reminded us , is spending more money in preparation for war than the most highly militarized nations of the world is in no position to unfurl the peace pact over a petty brush at arms which is already at the point of settlement . As we said last week , we welcome the fact that the Administration feels a moral responsibility for its signature of the peace pact , but with the responsibility must go intelligence and common sense . The results of Mr. Stimson 's ineptitude are lamentable . By rushing ahead where intelligence and common prudence should have warned him to go slowly , Mr. Stimson has called down upon American diplomacy a resounding rebuke . He has very possibly dealt a blow at the efficacy of the peace pact from which it may be long in recovering . His bungling has cast a cloud over the London Conference . It is to be hoped that he will have his wits about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , since otherwise a mobilized public opinion may incline to think that the time has come for him to keep as much as possible out of sight . Failure in Haiti T HE strikes that almost culminated in a rebellion , the riots in the customs houses , the affair at Aux Cayes where a marine patrol killed five Haitians and wounded twenty more , and General Russell 's urgent appeal for more marines  --  these events are the final demonstration that the fourteen years of Yankee rule in Haiti have been an ignoble failure . We began by destroying the parliamentary basis of the old governmental system and installed in its place a military despotism operating through the flimsy mask of a native dictatorship ; we have taken over control of the finances and of the economic life of the island , but , as the export figures show , we have not much improved the economic situation of the " republic " ; we have boasted that we have built roads , created a constabulary , and " maintained law and order " ? and look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to authorize a commission to investigate conditions in Haiti . What they need is exposure rather than more investigation , and it will be a disgrace to the United States if the commission sent to Haiti feels that " patriotism " requires it to whitewash General Russell and his associates in the administration of the island . " Our representatives in Haiti , " Mr. Hoover says in his message to Congress , " have shown great ability and devotion and have accomplished signal results in the improvement of the material condition of the people . " Devotion General Russell undoubtedly has shown , but the fact that he is at odds with American business men and with Haitians , and that he has permitted the puppet government which the marines installed in office to accumulate such a high tide of resentment as has just manifested itself speaks ill for his ability . It was an error , from every point of view , to name a military officer as High Commissioner . General Russell made the mistake of regarding efficient , rather than Haitian administration as his objective . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual Marine Corps propaganda about the backwardness and incompetence of the Haitians . Doubtless they have not attained the high level of civilization of Mr. Vare 's Philadelphia or Big Bill the Builder 's and Scarface Al Capone 's Chicago . But the propaganda obscures certain facts . The Haitians , unassisted , drove their French masters out of the island , and maintained their independence for more than a century  --  until Admiral Caperton landed the marines , with the quaint aim and ambition , as he put it , " to ensure , establish , and help to maintain Haitian independence . " In that period Haiti had revolutions and bloodshed . So did we . She had no civil war as destructive of life and property as our own , and she lost by assassination precisely the same number of presidents as we  --  no more , despite the legends . She maintained the stability of her finances , and gave no occasion for foreign intervention . On the whole , she managed a better level of government than several of her neighbors on the mainland of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . There is voodooism in Haiti , even more of it than of hexing in Pennsylvania ; an upper-class oligarchy dominates the countryside , possibly even more effectively than in Mississippi and Arkansas . The population is largely illiterate , as are Brazil 's and China 's ; and it is alsoeconomically backward . But there is nothing in Haiti 's history or present situation to indicate that she can not , if left alone by the marines , maintain an adequate government . Smedley Butler , pistol in hand , dissolved the last Haitian Senate thirteen years ago , because , though it had been bullied into accepting a Haitian-American treaty drawn up in Washington , it refused to accept a constitution for its own country drafted in the same foreign capital . Since then , there have been no elections in Haiti ; and General Russell permitted President Borno to announce that there would be no parliamentary elections in 1930 . It is this utter failure to provide a parliamentary outlet to the Opposition which has finally led Haitians into the heroic but desperate folly of armed opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uprising , was forced to declare that he would not himself be a candidate for reelection as President in 1930 ; but that means little , for , in the absence of any constitutional parliament , the new President will be elected by a council of state of twenty-one members , all of whom President Borno has himself appointed . It was General Russell 's excuse that elections would have brought into power a bitter anti-American party ; but what a confession of failure that is ! In 1920 the dissidents took to armed revolt against the Yankee invasion , and in the course of battle some 2,000 Haitians were killed  --  the bloodiest engagements in a century of Haitian history . There will be no such general revolt this year  --  for one reason because the marine-officered Garde d'Haiti has built ten airports and installed 293 miles of military telephone lines , and has the advantage of the new roads . That will mean less bloodshed ; it will not mean less bitterness . We have no doubt that the marines will reestablish order rapidly , ruthlessly , and efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Latin America and in Europe , will largely depend upon what we do next . President Hoover 's commission should act energetically to get the marines out of Haiti , where they have never belonged . Mr. Hoover Reports AD we not sworn never to sponsor another reform organization we should be appealing today for a Society to Reform Presidential Messages , and to obtain legislation limiting their length and setting penalties for unbearable dullness . We confess that it is Mr. Hoover 's first annual message to Congress that moves us in this wise . For tameness it ranks high . If it is somewhat more gram-matical and better expressed than the messages of Calvin Coolidge , it none the less so closely resembles them and those of the unlamented Warren Harding that if one were to take half a dozen of them at random from the last three Repub-lican Administrations , blot out all the dates in them , cut off the signatures , and shuffle them it would be impossible for any ordinary intelligence to guess their authorship or year . Mr. Hoover has obviously merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message so long that it took , it is said , two hours to read it to Congress , which is reason enough why Mr. Hoover did not appear to present it in person . Yet it is a revealing document , for it reveals the author . He is again without a fighting spirit . Not even in behalf of the tariff , which he again demands of Congress , does he strike sparks . The document is even without such vigor as Mr. Hoover has put into his addresses to his conferences of business men . Certainly no Senator will be stirred by anything which the President has said to change his ways or his attitude toward pending legislation . Especially striking is the fact that the President does not report to the Congress anything about his conversations with the Prime Minister of Great Britain . The London Conference on Naval Disarmament , upon which so much of Mr. Hoover 's prestige has come to depend , is dismissed in eight lines . The rest is largely a restatement of his views as to the essential soundness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of administrative methods which will meet with approval . It is only when he comes to talk of the tremendous militarist expenditures of the United States that he touches on the raw a really vital situation  --  as is evidenced by the foreign press which naturally leaped to the opportunity to point the moral . Certainly no one can disagree with his statement that we should be " deeply concerned however , with the growing expense " for national defense purposes , which has risen from $267,000,000 in 1914 to $730,000,000 in the current fiscal year , eleven years after we won the war to end war . We wish there might be put up in every schoolhouse and public building in the country these words of the President : " The total of our expenditures is in excess of those of the most highly militarized nations of the world . " The President adds that if the coming London Conference is not a success " we shall be committed during the next six years to a construction expenditure on ships of upward of $1,200,000,000 , besides the necessary further increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out the amazing fact that our citizens ' army , including the National Guard , has risen from 299,000 men in 1914 to 672,000 in 1924 , and to no less than 728,000 in 1929 . This , we repeat , is the net result of our safeguarding democracy and winning the war to end war eleven years ago . Does the President make vigorous and concrete proposals as to how this steady militarization of America shall be ended , and the terrible financial burden upon the American people be lifted ? He does not . He merely declares hopelessly that if the Conference at London can not agree we must go on building these unnecessary warships and buying quantities of airplanes , although , as he himself says , we have solemnly covenanted with the world to use these forces only for defensive purposes . Then he washes his hands of the whole thing and passes it over to the tender mercies of Congress with this anti-climax : " I recommend that Congress give earnest consideration to the possibilities of prudent action which will give relief from our continuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructive statesman , with his vital suggestions for blazing the way for the country to escape from the militaristic mess into which it has so needlessly floundered . As for the rest , the President reiterates his stand , as to which no one is in doubt , on the great economic questions of the day . Reversing the Coolidge policy , he is for making Muscle Shoals an experiment station to benefit agricultural needs and the chemical industry , but he is unalterably opposed to " the operation by the government of either power or manufacturing business except as an unavoidable byproduct of some other major public purpose . " All in all , it is again the timid engineer in politics who speaks . A Sea Change W HILE landsmen are discussing politics and finance , the latest books and the most recent plays , a controversy practically unknown to them is raging at sea as fiercely as are winds and waves . It is nothing less than whether sailors shall abandon their long-established custom of speaking of right as left and of left as right . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reminded that for many years when an dificer has wished to direct his ship to the starboard ( or right ) he has called to the man at the wheel " Port , " while when he has wished to turn to the left ( or port ) he has said " Starboard . " And if this seems ridiculous to the man ashore , he should recall that in an earlier era ships ' rudders were moved not by wheels but by tillers , as those of small boats are to this day . A tiller , of course , has to be swung to the left in order to turn the rudder and the boat to the right . That was also true of the earlier steering wheels ( it is still the case with some of those of our inland waters ) , but gradually the method was superseded by wheels which moved the ship in the same direction as they themselves turned . But the old orders persisted , and the first thing for a sailor to learn about steering is that starboard means port and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that their response has become automatic and there have not been many errors . There have been some , though , and the recent international conference for safety of life at sea voted that after June , 1931 , helm orders shall be used in the direct instead of the reverse sense . The recommendation has not yet been ratified by the governments concerned , but it doubtless will be , and the impending change is already occasioning a tempest of argument and conjecture . Happily the conference did not suggest that the words " port " and " starboard " should be discarded , although it should not be forgotten that " port " is itself a comparatively new arrival in the sailors ' dictionary , the older term having been " larboard , " which was scrapped because of its similarity in sound to " starboard . " To erase " port " and " starboard " from the seaman 's lingo would take a landsman and a dictator . Our navy had both in Secretary Josephus Daniels , who in 1913 decreed " right " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct sense . The international conference for safety of life at sea insists on no such revolution , but the Honorable Company of Master Mariners of Great Britain thinks that mistakes are likely to happen during the period of transition unless existing orders are somewhat amplified . Among the suggestions for new helm orders which seem most satisfactory are " Port ship " and " Starboard ship , " or " Steer port " and " Steer starboard . " These orders are so explanatory that they ought to reduce to a minimum mistakes due to changing from one system to another . The change will be hardest for the old salts ; the youngsters will adapt themselves to it with hardly a qualm or a frown . And the young persons who sit , on moonlight nights , as near the bow as they can get and discuss irrelevancies  --  provided they discuss anything at all  --  will not know which way the helm is put down , or consider the matter worthy of investigation .               @ @ @ @ @ @
