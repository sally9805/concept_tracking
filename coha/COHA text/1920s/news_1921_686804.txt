txt FOREIGN VALUATION . Webster 's Opinion on the Law Passed in 1833 . To the Editor of The New York Times : The Senate Finance Committee is considering the provision ? for " home valuation " contained in the Tariff hill which it has received from the House . Let me call attention to the fact that in the " compromise tariff " of 1833 a provision was inserted that there should be a gradual reduction of the duties levied by that tariff , and that in the year 1842 they should all he reduced to a uniform rate of 20 per cent. , to be levied upon the valuation in the United States . When the year 1842 arrived it became manifest that this provision was insufficient to provide enough revenue for the support of the Government , and the question of the basis upon which ad valorem duties should be levied Was also discussed . Daniel Webster , who was then Secretary of State , was consulted by the President , and gave his opinion in favor of a change in the act of 1833 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , page 246 ) : " Ir . support of this opinion , the undersigned suggests , in the first place , the great , if not the insurmountable , difficulties of establishing a home valuation at any port , without running the risk of producing such diversity , in the estimates of . value , as ? shall not only lead to great practical inconvenience , but interfere , also , in effect , with the constitutional provisions , that duties and imposts shall bo equal in all States . " This opinion prevailed , and ever since then ad valorem duties have been collected upon the foreign valuation . The reasons for this are certainly much stronger now than they were in 1842 . The enormous growth of this country has necessarily produced a difference in value in different ports . Many articles , for example , ' of import command a different price in San Francisco from that which they do in New York . How is it possible then to fix a home valuation which shall ho uniform ?

Further Study of This Legislation Is Advised . To the Editor of The New York Times : The comments in this morning 's TIMES on Senator Reed 's attitude with reference to the Sheppard-To'ner bill are quite justified , but it is most unfortunate that the objections to tile passage of this measure are not regarded in a more serious light . The limitations necessarily imposed on a letter submitted for publication in your columns would not permit of a thorough discussion of the objections to this particular bill . No one can honestly claim any disagreement with the underlying factors which seem to demand the attention of the Federal Government , namely , better care for the Prospective mother . The quarrel is not so much with the possible need of such care , although this Is much disputed , but with the methods proposed for providing the same . Senator Reed 's strictures against Instruction in maternity care given by unmarried women are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction desired can undoubtedly be given through the medium of trained nurses as proposed in the bill , but the directing power should be in the hands of medically trained persons and not those whose interest In the question is largely sociological We have had ample experience with the handling of strictly medical questions by the laity , and it were better , it seems to me at least , if the carrying out of a measure of this kind could be postponed until proper agencies have been developed to carry out the same . The multiplication of governmental bureaus , each confined to a limited field , without co-operation and co-ordination , is not conducive either to economy or to progress . There seems to he no more reason for a minor bureau in the Department of Labor to take up the question of better maternity care than for the Department of State to attempt the eradication of the threatened pellagra plague described in another column of today 's TIMES . The question of providing better ma ternity care is largely medical and medicine of today has become a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Department of Labor and place its activitiesin a more congenial atmosphere . One of tire most serious objections to the Sheppard-Towner bill resides in the fact that the community interest , so vital to the success of welfare work , is completely subordinated , financially , scientifically and otherwise , to a single person  --  the head of the Children 's Bureau of the Department of Labor  --  without suitable control by a properly constituted board of review . Community developments financially fostered on a fifty-fifty basis by Federal agencies are known to result in financial extravagances and maladministration . If the subject of better maternity care demands the attention of the Federal Government , then let this be done through tile medium of the Public Health Service or a national department of health , organized for such purposes . The Sheppard-Towner bill is vague In everything but its title and financial provisions . A personal participation in a hearing before the House Committee has convinced me of the necessity for further consideration by the public and their representatives In Congress of thil important measure , the passage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any hope for better care of mothers and children . GEORGE W. KOSMAK , M. D. Now York , July 25 , 1921 . Dover Patrol Monument . To the Editor of The New York Times : The proposed presentation by thee Britian Memorial Association to this country of an cbelisk recalling the " Dover Straits Patrol , " of which our navy constituted an able part , has been accepted . The City of New York has " given a site for the memorial at the foot of Eighty-sixth Street . " On the tall cliffs of Dover , swept by stiff sea winds , were met recently a body of officers and men of the British Navy who unveiled an obelisk commemorating the dark end hazardous days of the " Dover Straits Patrol . " Many among them must have raised their gaze seaward , straight across the Atlantic to the United States , to their companions of the great adventure .

Is this memorial obelisk to be buried alive ? A fitting resting place would be the high cliffs of New Jersey , where , with the tearing winds of the Atlantic on bleak Winter nights , this monument would silhouette against a rift in the sky as a sentinel .

To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with considerable interest the article In last Sunday 's MAGAZIaS entitled " Pictorial History of Baseball , " and because of that interest I am writing to call your attention to the inaccuracy of one statement made by the writer , viz. : " The famous Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869 played all season without a defeat , winning fifty-seven games . " I do not recall how many games they played , but I saw them meet defeat at the hands of the Atlantics on the Capitoline Grounds , Brooklyn . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie and the Red Stockings left the field , but later returned and resumed play , and the winning run for the Atlantics was made by Dickey Pearce , the shortstop . It was a great day for Brooklyn , I can assure you , and I trust you may find it worth while to give credit where credit is due . W. n . J. New York , Aug. 2 , 1921 . The Dye Industry . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with great Interest your editorial article In Ole mornInee Timm in regard to Representative Friar , who dwelt at length on the " dyestuff monopoly " In the United States in his endeavor to kill any constructive legislation for this industry , which , from the point of view of national defense , is so vital .
