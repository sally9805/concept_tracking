The broad smiles that wreathed Wall Street last autumn returned one afternoon last week . Four tokens of a renaissance in the stock market had made their appearance : <P> U. S. Steel common touched 139% , a new high for all time . General Motors common came within two points of its high ( 150 ) . <P> Thirty other stocks reached high levels for the year . A Stock Exchange seat brought a new-record price of $155,000-which was $6,000 higher than the last sale ; $5,000 higher than the last record . <P> Discussing these matters on the golf course over the weekend , even crabbed gentlemen whose putting was way off were forced to admit that steel is still industry 's best barometer . Of the General Motors rise they could point out that it was based on a report from Detroit that retail auto sales in May had unprecedentedly outstripped sales in April , but that this report was based , in turn , upon unusually late motoring weather . The 30 other stocks were , however , indubitable evidence of the bankers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price could not be discounted as a phenomenon of supply and demand . The majority of seat buyers lately has not consisted of youngsters experimenting with their patrimony or carrying on a family tradition , but of the shrewdest , toughmindedest , kind of traders and market students , and of keen younger men enlisted and financed by the old houses to cope with voluminous business , present and future .
