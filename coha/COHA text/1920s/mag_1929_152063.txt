Congressman John Nance Garner , new minority leader of the House , last week discovered a leak , let out a warning shout . His face red with apprehension , he pointed an accusing finger at the locked double doors of the House Ways &; Means Committee behind which Republican committee members were secretly writing a new tariff bill . Mr. Garner charged that through the doors had seeped many a fact by which shrewd men in trade could profit . Such leaks , he cried , were " unfair . . . unjust . . . not right . . . wrong . . . indefensible ! " Republicans calmly retorted that , if leaks there had been about the new tariff bill , they were " unintentional . " Certain tariff facts loomed large in ad vance of the bill 's presentation : Sugar . The prospect of a higher sugar duty brought to Washington agitated representatives of the Cuban producers . The proposal to limit the free entry of Philippine sugar to 500,000 tons per year accounted for the presence in Washington of Speaker Manuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Os-mena of the Philippine Senate , and Philippine Secretary of Agriculture Rafael Alunan . They had traveled 11,000 miles to enlist Secretary of State Stimson in a protest . The beet-sugar industry ( Colorado , Wyoming , Utah ) complains that it can not meet competition from Cuba and the Philippines . To protect its market , it would raise the world sugar duty from $2.20 to $3 per 100 Ib . Cuba , enjoying a 20% differential , would pay $2.40 per 100 Ib. instead of the present rate of $1.76 . Such an increase would add $90,000,000 to the annual U. S. sugar bill . Even with this protection , free sugar from the Philippines landed in New York at $3.55 per 100 Ib. , would still menace the beet-sugar industry , claimed its leaders . Hence the house committee considered putting a limit of 500,000 tons on the amount of Philippine sugar admitted duty free and imposing a special duty ( amount unsettled ) on Island imports above that limit . <P> The Messrs . Roxas , Osmena and Alunan went into conference with Secretary Stimson in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once been president of the Philippine Sugar Association and , in his official capacity as Secretary of Agriculture , he foresees only ruin for the Island 's industry if the U. S. taxes their chief product . Secretary Stimson was sympathetic . He went before the Republican members of the Ways &; Means Committee last week as an evangel for free Philippine sugar . <P> To tax this Island commodity , he said , would be a " betrayal of trust by the U. S. toward a dependent people . " He argued that Philippine sugar , less than one-fifth of U. S. consumption , does not affect the domestic market , that the attempt to limit Philippine sugar came not from the U. S. beet-sugar industry but " directly from those interests which have invested in Cuban sugar . " He denied that domestic sugar interests could increase their production if importation from the Philippines were restricted . <P> What Secretary Stimson left to Philippine officials to say was that such a sugar duty would inflame the Islands to fresh demands for independence .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
