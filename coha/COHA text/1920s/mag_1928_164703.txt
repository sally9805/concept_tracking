When vigilant conservatives denounce " The Red Menace of Moscow ! " they commonly have in mind ( however vaguely or ignorantly ) the Communist organization for world propaganda which is famed and dreaded as the " Third Internationale " but is actually named the Third International Association of Workingmen . Last week the Communist party of the U. S. sent to Moscow as delegates to the sixth conference of the Third Internationale , Comrade John Pepper &; Comrade John Loveday . A total of 50 nations were represented . Cheers rose all round Comrade Loveday , when he cried : " A free proletarian state will arise in the U. S. on the ruins of capitalism ! " In short , the " Red Menace of Moscow " was in plenary and executive session , for the first time in four years . Conservatives redoubled nervous vigilance . Calm impartial observers refreshed their memories as to the actual nature of the Internationale by re-reading Article I of its Constitution .

Today he is right-hand henchman to Dictator of Soviet Russia Josef Stalin , many of whose speeches he is believed to write . Pounding for order in parliamentary fashion , Chairman Bukharin announced the following agenda of subjects for discussion : 1 ) Reiteration of the program of world revolution . 2 ) Encouragement of Communism in nationalist China and India . 3 ) Defensive measures against the wars being planned by Capitalism . 4 ) Encouragement of revolt movements in all colonies held by imperialistic powers . 5 ) Inspection of the condition of the All-Union Communist party of the Soviet Union . . . .                 @ @ @ @
