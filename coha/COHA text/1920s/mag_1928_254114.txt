Last week the U. S. 's biggest trademarked food company bought out the biggest-selling high-grade brand of coffee-paying for it the equivalent of 66 million dollars . <P> Postum Company , biggest trademarked food company , began at Battle Creek , Mich. , 33 years ago when the late Charles W. Post pottered around an oven with wheat bran and molasses . By roasting them he sought a coffee substitute . He found the substitute and called it Postum Cereal . <P> People liked Postum cereal 's morning brew , and their purchases gave Post enough money to continue pottering around the oven . Whole wheat and barley came out of the oven Grape Nuts . Later came thin , crisp Post Toasties , then Instant Postum powder . These four products were the foundation blocks of the great Postum business . <P> Two and a half years ago a great superstructure began . Postum Company , which had multiplied its 200,000 common shares to 2,000,000 , began to buy allied but not competitive companies-and their trademarked advertised products . That is why the Postum Company now sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker chocolate D-zerta <P> Baker cocoanut Swans-Down flour <P> Hellman mayonnaise Instant Swans-Down <P> Annis horseradish Minute tapioca <P> Log Cabin syrup Minute gelatine <P> Sanka coffee* Pearl tapioca <P> Jell-O Baker cocoa <P> Jell-O ice cream powder <P> To this unparalleled list of advertisingly famed eatables the Postum Company last week added Maxwell House coffee . <P> Cheek-Neal Co. of Nashville makes Maxwell coffee . Fifty-five years ago Joel O. Cheek and J. Will Neal worked for a wholesale grocer at Nashville . Mr. Cheek 's job was to sell coffee to the general stores of Tennessee hill villages . He rode a saddle horse and carried coffee samples in his saddle bags . At that time he affected a pointed beard . When he came home from a trip he would potter around his kitchen oven roasting experimental blends of coffee . He used twelve-pint coffee pots for brewing his blends . His eight sons and one daughter guard those pots as heirlooms . Two of these sons sell Dodge cars in Tennessee . The other six are officers in the business . J. Will Neal and his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the company has one of its seven coffee-blending factories and distributing plants . President is Joel O. Cheek , 75 . For two years now his sons have managed to keep him from working hard . But he is at the Nashville offices almost every day . <P> In the Reconstruction 1870 's , Joel O. Cheek and J. Will Neal quit their jobs to sell coffee for themselves . The Maxwell House ( Hotel ) , now tattered , was just opened at Nashville . Young Mr. Cheek persuaded the managers to use his coffee and when Maxwell House guests demanded the blend , he used the hotel 's name as his trademark . <P> President Roosevelt once stopped at Nashville at the Hermitage ( Andrew Johnson 's home ) and had a cup of this coffee . He smacked his lips and demanded another . Cried he : " Good to the last drop . " <P> Until 1921 , when Cheek-Neal opened a factory in Brooklyn , it was a sectional brand , known little out of its own territory-the South .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
