txt A PARSONAGE AND $1,600 . The program of the Lutheran Synod of Eastern Pennsylvania recalls a great deal of past history and . throws considerable light upon history in the making . It is that every pastor : should have at least $1,500 a year and a parsonage . " I regret , " Lays the Rev. GEORGE A. GREISS , newly elected President of the Synod , " that there " are churches which do not appreci " ate their duty to their pastors . " The same could be said of almost any other denomination . Thanks to many a wartime drive , college professors are reasonably well paid ; new legislation has largely provided for teachers in the public schools . But the profession which is generally held to be highest of all has been , in comparison , neglected . The average pay of ministers is said to be less than $1,000 a year  --  without a parsonage . The most significant comparison is not with the other learned professions , but ' witlt.manual laborers . Mean annual wages on therailways rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1919 . In the Steel Corporation they rose from $729 in 1908 to $905 in 1914 and to $1,950 in 1919 . Since the steel strike there haa been a considerable further advance . Doubtless a larger number of common laborers than of ministers are living on the margin of subsistence , but , by and large , the difference between the lot of the unskilled worker and the lot of the highly educated and responsible leaders of the spiritual life of the nation is negligible . Yet when the Interchurch World Committee was launching ifs drive in behalf of the salaries of the clergy it stepped aside to investigate the lives of the steel workers , with the result that it frustrated and probably wrecked its own cause . In its published report it gave sympathetic portraits of the two strike organizers , though W. Z. FOSTER Is a . prociaimes ) Syndicalist and borer from within and JOHN FITZPATRIC K is a proclaimed Bolshevik ; and in its final program for the reorganization of the industry it included that primary doctrine of the Guild Socialist , " industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed a high degree of courage and self-sacrifice , or that its report contains much that is significant and moving . But all this is beside the present point . The present point is that neglect of the learned professions has synchronized with a - rapid growth of radicalism and has , in all probability , been very largely the ' cause of it . One of the leading arguments for the college drives was that the radicalism ' which has of late been so pronounced in the - universities is in a great measure attributable to unjust salaries and the restriction of opportunity which they involve . Unless the pay of the clergy is adequate there must eventually be a decline in the quality of spiritual leadership . There is scarcely a denomination that does not owe it to itself to adopt this program of $1,500 a year and a parsonage . There is no community that does not owe it to itself and to the nation to see that the program is made possible .                 @ @ @ @
