The public fancy was last week drawn , unexpectedly , to a romantic anachronism in U. S. travel-the oldtime river packet , built like a summer hotel on a flatboat , puffing smoke from tall twin funnels set near the flat round bows , slapping up the river mud with broad paddles set astern . The occasion was a race between the Betsy Ann and the Chris Greene , two packets plying the Ohio between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh . Captain Chris Greene of the Chris Greene had boasted that his vessel , a steel craft built in 1925 , could beat the Betsy Ann " any time . " This was nothing short of insulting to a little wooden ship who had made speed records 30 years ago on the Mississippi and who had a pair of gold-tipped elk horns to prove her an undefeated champion . The Betsy Ann 's owner , Frederick Way , staked the elk horns that Captain Chris Greene was wrong and told him to put his boat on a starting line . They would race from Cincinnati upstream to New Richmond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skippers bawled orders through megaphones . The Chris Greene started ahead , with the Betsy Ann hanging alongside , taking smart advantage of the Chris Greene 's swell . Negro roustabouts exchanged cheers and grimaces . It was an oldtime scene , but without the oldtime violence and danger . Barging into the other boat or crowding it ashore was ruled out . Government inspectors were on hand to see that the racers did not exceed their legal allowances of boiler pressure . The Chris Greene drew a length ahead , two lengths , four lengths , five . The Chris Greene 's purser appeared on deck with a big sign : " Chris Greene-Rah , Rah ! " Thousands of people cheered from the leafy , sun-shot shores . At the finish the Betsy Ann was about 1000 feet behind . A true sportsman , Owner Way promptly boarded the Chris Greene and handed over the Betsy Ann 's elk horns . The Senator Cordhill , another Pittsburgh packet , soon challenged the Chris Greene . Rivermen looked for a return of their Golden Age .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
