txt Down at the government experiment station at Tallulah , La. , an airplane occasionally skims across a cotton field . Behind it streams a cloud of calcium arsenate , the one remedy thus far discovered for the control of the boll weevil . An industry representing a capital investment of approximately $10,000.000,000. supporting 3,500.000 wage earners and 15.000,000 dependents , is vitally interested in the result of the experiments . The Department of Agriculture says that weevils reduced the 1921 yield of cotton 109.1 pounds per acre . That same destruction on the present acreage would amount to a loss of 3,778,000,000 pounds of cotton , with a farm price above 20 cents a pound . If that estimate were halved and then cut in two , the loss would still he serious . The weevil is a menace to cotton , and it is ? obvious that a crop equal to the world 's needs can not be produced again until an effective method of controlling the weevil has been found . B. R. Coad , an entomologist in the service of the Department of Agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found that the insect sipped the dew from the leaves of the cotton plants . This discovery led to the use of calcium arsenate. , which is applied at night . Machines have been perfected ranging from a small hand affair to large ones drawn by mules and dusting three rows at a time . Often , however , the work is undone by rains washing off the poison almost as soon as applied . A cheaper and quicker method of applying the poison seems necessary especially on large plantations . And it is on large and medium-sized plantations that cotton in the future will be raised . The airplane seems the most logical solution of the problem before the cotton planter . If its use can be made a commercial success , a great advance will be made in weevil control . Dr. Coad. who is an extremely conservative man , says that his experiments will demonstrate that the plane can be successfully used . If he makes good his promise , the way will he open in a few years hence to supply the world with its requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
