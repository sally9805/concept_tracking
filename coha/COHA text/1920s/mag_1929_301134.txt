Paris correspondents with nothing much to do sauntered around to the dingy Hospice de la Salptrire last week and dug a choice little story out of Professor Jean Antonin Gosset , famed remover of the prostate glands of Georges Clmenceau ( 1912 ) and Raymond Poincar who left the hospital and strode spryly home last week ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) . <P> Salptrire students were quick to boast of their beloved professor 's exploits . In particular they told how , when his own appendix needed outing , he lay down on the operating table of his lecture room , called for students taking his course in advanced surgery , selected one by lot and bade him cut away . <P> Modest to the point of bashfulness , Professor Gosset explained to last week 's newsmen that his appendix exploit was merely a classroom demonstration of two maxims he tries to impress upon all his students : <P> 1 ) " Do unto others in a surgical sense what you would have others do unto you . " <P> 2 ) " If you are hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would do to your father . " <P> In 1915 at Chalons-sur-Marne , Professor Gosset improvised the first operating-room-ambulance , inaugurated the technique of sewing up soldiers on the spot almost as soon as they are blown open . In 1928 he was elected President of the French Congress of Surgeons . For 17 years he has refused , with a Frenchman 's indomitable stubbornness , to be transferred from his beloved old hospital and lecture hall to more ornate quarters and a better paying professorship.
