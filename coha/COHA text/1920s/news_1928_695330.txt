Republicles and Democrats alike are convinced that in these two sections are the real battlegrounds . If the Democrats carry New York , lissmchusetts , Connecticut , and New Jersey in rho cast , Maryland , MisOral , and Oklahoma among the border Rates , Wisconsin in the middle west , Montana and Nevada in the far west , Ind all the southern states , Smith will win with 26G electoral votes . This would be an exact majority of the iil votes in the electoral college . Eight other states in which Smith a conceded to have a fighting chance Save together only 66 electoral votes . Capture of nearly all of them would eearcely offset the loss of two or three of the eastern and border states . Hoover May Win 413 .

That prohibition rather than farm relief will be the decisive issue if Smith wins Is the belief of his managers . The eastern and other states in which the Smith forces will concentrate their attack are known as wet . Most of them are normally Republican and If the Democrats carry them ft will be on the prohibition issue . The southern dry states are counted upon to continue their habit of voting Democratic regardless of their objection to a wet candidate . While farm relief will be stressed by the Democrats in western states , the Smith managers do not have much hope of making serious inroads into the Republican agricultural areas . Even if one or two of the states where agricultural unrest is most acute go Democratic their electoral votesprobablY would not be an important factor In determining the result .

There are 15 Hoosier electoral votes . At the time of the Hoover  --  IN-flits pre-convention fight the Democrats cast eyes at Ohio , but the Republican factions appear to have buried the hatchet and last Tuesday 's 1 , rimaries demonstrated the dryness of voters In both parties . The Democrats do not profess much optimism regarding Iowa . Nebraska , and Kansas . Even If they won either North or South Dakota , each with only five electoral votes , it would not help much .

These threel states helped to pull Woodrow Wilson through in 1916 , but all of them were in the Republican column in 1920 and 1924 . The Republicans believe that Hoover will carry them this time . Here 's How They List Votes . Of the 266 electoral votes listed as a possible combination to bring about the election of Smith , 126 are from the south , 84 from the east , 3G from border states , 13 front the middle west , and seven from the far west . The , outhern stales in the list are : Alabama , 12 ; Arkansas , 9 ; Florida , 6 ; Georgia , 14 ; Louisiana , 10 ; Mississippi . Hi ; North Carolina , 12 ; South Carolina . 9 ; Tennessee , 12 ; Texas , 20 ; and Virginia , 12 . The eight additional states where Smith 's chances are fairly good are Indiana. , 15 , in the middle west ; Kentucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states ; Rhode Island , 6 , and Delaware , 3 , in the east ; and Colorado , 6 , Arizona , 3 , and New Mexico , 3. fn the far west . It is obvious that the failure of the Democrats to capture Massachusetts , Connecticut , and New Jersey in the cast and Missouri and Oklahoma among border states would make it impossible , for Smith to win . These live states have an aggregate of 57 electoral votes , while the eight nosDemocratic states not represented in the original 266 Smith votes have only 66 . How It Would Work Out . On the assumption that Smith wins with the 266 votes enumerated , ! Hoover 's 265 would be made up of t hi ) electoral votes from the cast , 21 nom border states , 108 from the mid-1 die west , and 76 from the far west .

As compared with eight states where Smith has a fighting chance outside of his 266 , Hoover has ten states which ho may carry besides those Included in tho above 265 . The ten have 148 electoral votes , as against the 56 votes in tho Smith eight possibilities . . G. 0 . 1 ' , Hopeful of New York .
