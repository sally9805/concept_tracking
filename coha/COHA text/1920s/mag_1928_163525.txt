A friend of Signor Benito Mussolini dating from before his rise to power is the learned Jesuit scholar , Father Tacchi-Venturi of Rome . He persuaded Il Duce some years ago to present a State collection of ancient religious books to the Vatican . Generally it is known that Father Tacchi-Venturi has since been the chief intermediary between his Great &; Good Friend and Pope Pius XI in recent attempts to negotiate a settlement of the Roman Question ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) . Last week a paper knife entered the flesh of Jesuit Tacchi-Venturi amid dramatic circumstances . <P> To the House of the Jesuits at Rome there had come and yanked the ancient bellpull a decently dressed youth who announced himself as Signor De Angelis . He must , he said , he must make an important confession to good Father Tacchi-Venturi . The porter , rubbing sleepy eyes , told the youth that his desired confessor was immersed in study , could not be disturbed . Next day Signor De Angelis returned , yanked the bell still more violently , and prevailed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Father Tacchi-Venturi , upon raising his eyes from his papers , saw a pale , demented face and a hand which grasped a slender , dagger-like paper knife . Quick , the assassin sprang . Quicker , the Jesuit dodged . As a result the knife barely lacerated the neck skin of Father Tacchi-Venturi . Meanwhile the sleepy porter had valorously collared Signor De Angelis . <P> The incident closed when Father Tacchi-Venturi 's neck was neatly bound up at the Santo Spirito Hospital . Later , seated in an armchair , he received a visit of condolence from Pietro Cardinal Gasparri , suave Papal Secretary of State .
