txt Auto Horns and Accidents . Thu report in Trim TIMES of the number of persons killed and injured by automobiles leads me to write the results of some observations I have made relating to that subject . I live on the corner of two intersecting streets , and while sitting on my piazza have been able to observe the practice of drivers . Some drivers , on approaching the corner , slow down to see if the way is clear . They do not use the horn , and it is this point I wish to stress . Others keep on at full speed , commence blowing the horn when 200 or more feet from the corner and without Mowing down make the crossing , This latter method is very common with truck drivers , and the reports show it is the truck that causes most of the accidents . From my piazza I have seen many narrow escapes , and invariably they have been the result of using the horn instead of slowing up . Without the horn , drivers would run slower . This abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time . JOHN R. ROBERTSON . Brooklyn , Aug. 9 , 1927.
