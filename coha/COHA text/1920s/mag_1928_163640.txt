SERVICE RECORD BY AN ARTILLERYMAN -L . V. Jacks-Scribners ( $2 ) . From a position as impersonal as an historian 's account of the battle of Crcy , Author Jacks describes his War experiences . " Major Thompson dismounted and walked back and forth among the cannon . ... He replied that the shot was not made that would kill him . ... " Scenes of hideousness are frequent , gallantry omnipresent . A cool sense of the pictorial dominates a style metaphorically fine ( if you think airplanes " steam by " ) . Non-belligerents will enjoy an atmosphere of accuracy ( if you think English soldiers wear " mufti " ) . The suggestion of continual pageantry runs pleasantly throughout the book-a relief from recent War stories , whether patriotic or sordid . Author Jacks might have been to the Crusades.
