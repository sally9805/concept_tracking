Often enough in the past , , the annual General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. A. has been an unfortunate uproar concerned with such things as how a god can have a mortal father . Fundamentalists have blown and stamped , Modernists have scoffed and reasoned , Moderates have explained and pleaded . This year , the meeting in Tulsa , Okla. , had a minimum of excursions and alarms . The Fundamentalists were apparently in sufficient majority to achieve victory in the things which lay nearest their hearts and Bibles ; they could not , however , expect to work their wills upon every issue . They did not try to do so : the conference opened two weeks ago like a lion 's mouth and closed last week like a lamb 's . <P> The first thing for the Presbyterians to do was to elect a moderator to succeed Dr. Robert E. Speer . This they did with rapidity on the first ballot . The new moderator is Dr. Hugh Kelso Walker , pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fundamentalist v. Modernist controversy . He beat the Fundamentalist candidate , Dr. J. Ambrose Dunkel of the Tabernacle Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis , by a vote of 593 to 318 . The moderate moderator named a vice moderator to help him in administering the affairs of his church . This was the Rev. Joseph M. Broady of Birmingham , Ala . <P> Their chief officers chosen , the commissioners of the Assembly proceeded to perilous business . What was to be done about many recent proposals for uniting the Presbyterian Church with other de nominations ? The Presbyterians refused to consider amalgamation with such sects as Christian , Universalist and Congregational Churches , because doctrinal differences seemed too extreme to eliminate at this time . To the more consequential proposal which they had received from the Methodist Episcopal Church ( TIME , May 21 ) , the Presbyterians gave a warmer rejoinder . They elected a committee to confer during the year with a similar Methodist committee to see what could be done about joining the two huge denominations           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
