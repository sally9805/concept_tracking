The application made a fortnight ago by certain U. S. Buddhists for permission to erect a statue of Siddartha Gautama in Central Park , Manhattan ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) was rejected last week by Francis D.

Each evening the paterfamilias , as family priest , lit the pilot , handed it most carefully over to his youngest to light ; on the first night of Channukah , one taper , on the second two , until on the eighth night the children blinked with dazzled delight before the nine bright , golden flame-tips that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wax or paraffin . ( Candle tallow is generally forbidden to Jews because it might come from a ritually unclean beast . ) <P> Channukah , a festival of gayety , rejoicing , blurs in the minds of U. S. children reared in Jewish faith because it occurs so close to Christmas . Christmas comes Dec. 25 , Channukah the 25th of Kislew ( Jewish calendar ) . At both , children are coddled , given presents . And both , curiously , merged centuries ago with heathen celebrations of the winter solstice , the turning of the year .
