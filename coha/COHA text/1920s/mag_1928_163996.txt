Robed and stately sheiks of the Arabian plateau gathered , last week , to imprint loud , smacking kisses of fealty on the tip of their potent Sultan 's nose . The monarch thus saluted was Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud , bronzed and stalwart Sultan of Nejd , King of the Hejaz . He subjects his nose to kisses , instead of receiving bows of homage , because his subjects are of a fanatically orthodox Moslem sect , the Wahabi , and hold that the pious should bow only to Allah . Last week the Sultan and his devout Sheiks were persistently reported to have launched a " Holy War . " Menaced areas : the British Mandates of Palestine , Transjordania , Irak and the Sultanate of Koweit . <P> A radio antenna sprouts from one of the squat mud turrets of Ibn Saud 's mud-walled Palace , at Riyadh , his Capital . Unfortunately , however , even such modern equipment could not enable the Sultan to know , last week , what the cables of the world press were flashing about his reputed " Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have smiled in grim derision at the following reports : <P> The Jewish Telegraph Agency alarmed from Jerusalem : " A force led by Sheik Ed Dowilsh with 1,400 camels is marching toward Irak . . . . Twenty-two British airplanes and seven tanks have been despatched to the frontier of Transjordania to protect the territory from . . . Ibn Saud . " <P> Englishmen began to take serious heed when the Manchester Guardian cut loose from decorum and stated that it would be " no picnic " to whip Ibn Saud . Meanwhile the British Laborite Daily Herald cried in frank alarm : " . . . This country is on the verge of war not with a few scattered tribes but with a monarch who has proved his ability and military strength and whose easy defeat can not be assumed . " <P> At London the first word of clear council to cut through the babbling of the press came from Sir Percy Zachariah Cox , who was the first British High Commissioner to Irak ( 1920-23 ) and has treated personally with Ibn Saud . <P> Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with caution . . . . It is certain that a rupture with Great Britain would be extremely repugnant to Ibn Saud . . . . <P> " Doubtless he finds himself in a difficult position in relation to his . . . subjects . . . unable to check their raiding . . . . " <P> Finally , when the " Holy War " had been fully exploited by Jew correspondents of Jerusalem and by sundry gentile newsgatherers in Irak , a statement forthcame from Ibn Saud . Through his representative at Cairo , Sheik Hafiz Wahba , the Sultan positively denied that he was making war upon the British Mandates , and stated that he was doing his best to quiet certain pugnacious bands of his tribesmen subjects who had been raiding along the frontier . <P> The Sultan " whose easy defeat can not be assumed , " even by the British Empire , has placed above one of his palace doors a verse which might be rendered thus : <P> Although we are of noble line , <P> We do not on our line depend ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they did , to the end .
