Suggestions <P> Sirs : <P> A national non-partisan news magazine partakes of many of the characteristics of a public service corporation . Many successful public utilities have found a wide distribution of stock among customers most beneficial to the success of the utility . <P> Permit the suggestion that TIME recast its capital structure and offer to its readers an opportunity to purchase its stock ; letting them have an opportunity to purchase common as well as preferred . <P> Think of the delightful outraged remonstrances that will be received from subscriber-stockholders when you fall into one of your seldom occurring errors ; the charming indignation when you appear , through colored glasses , to be partisan ; the boiling uproar when you punch a particularly tender spot . <P> Think of the eagerness with which stockholder-readers will pass by news , no matter how interesting , to read all advertisements , mentally balancing the columns of advertising with the columns of news ; clipping every coupon , patronizing every advertiser , creating by their actions added value to their property . <P> There is , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gloried in trodding unchartered paths . <P> GEORGE B. BARRETT <P> Augusta , Ga . <P> <P> Admirable idea . But the price of any TIME , INC. stock issued might appear so fantastic as to vex prospective purchasers. - ED . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> I suggest that you have the courage to confine your advertisements to the last pages and keep the reading matter entirely separate . . . . <P> THEODORE W. STERLING <P> Lookaway Farm <P> Buckingham Valley <P> Bucks County , Pa . <P> <P> Advertisements , too , are news . Even if they were not , TIME lacks courage to adopt so archaic a policy. - ED . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> Why not a section for current tid-bits of humor ? . . . <P> OTIS FULLER <P> Princeton , N.J. <P> <P> There are tidbit magazines aplenty. - ED . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> My suggestion is this : That in addition to your saying " See National Affairs " that you add page so and so and that as you have three columns , you divide this up into six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , E , F. A simple explanation of this division would soon become familiar to your readers and would greatly assist in tying in photographs to the proper subject matter , which I think now is quite annoying . . . . <P> WALTER C. HILL <P> Saginaw , Mich . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> I wish you would not be so bluntly sensual in Theatre notes . . . . <P> A SUBSCRIBER* <P> <P> Sirs : <P> Why does not TIME , whose motto is terseness , compactness , adopt phonetic spelling ? <P> EDMUND L. EBERLING <P> San Francisco , Calif . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> TIME is more than a chronicle . Therefore this letter . The style and diction of TIME conclusively proves that on its staff there are word wizards . The ordinary reader , without an unabridged dictionary and a fair knowledge of latin roots , is very apt to feel some uncertainty as to your meaning when he runs into typically TIME words , such as these : <P> Azimuth <P> Bravura <P> Brouhaha <P> Chatelaine <P> Castigation <P> Cliches <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lachrymose <P> Milieu <P> Prosodist <P> Prolation <P> Penates
