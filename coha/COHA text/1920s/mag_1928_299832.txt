An expert was needed to find out why the National Railways of Mexico have for so long been making so little money . Mexico might have sought her expert in the . U. S. ( where most miles of railway are ) , or in Great Britain ( where express trains make longest , fastest non-stop runs ) , or even in Scandinavia ( for Swedes are great railway builders to the minor nations ) . <P> Instead the railway doctor who has just prescribed for Mexico was found in Canada . He is Sir Henry Worth Thornton , since 1922 chairman of the Board and president of the Canadian National Railways . Last week the secret of his recent suspiciously informal visit to Mexico with Canadian railway colleagues was finally revealed . <P> Finance Minister Luis Montes de Oca explained , in a report addressed to the Mexican Congress last week , that Sir Henry was called in consultation , last year , when it became apparent that the problem of the national debt could not be resolved until the national railways had been placed on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , said Seor Montes de Oca , " The Ministry of Finance are convinced that rehabilitation of our finances will not be realized if the National Railways are not administered as a private enterprise . <P> Therefore the Government considers it indispensable to reform our statutes in such a way that railway progress equal to that in other countries may be made in Mexico . " <P> Observers took keen interest in the fact that young , spirited , dynamic Finance Minister Montes de Oca has swallowed with such enthusiasm the Canadian doctor 's bulky capsule : denationalization of railways . In Mexico , where advanced social theorizing is typical of even elder politicians , young Minister Montes de Oca might well have aspired to become a benevolent Railway Tsar . <P> Instead he preached ruthless denationalization to Congress , last week , as the keynote of his whole new fiscal policy . Briefly this consists in postponing repayments to foreign creditors of the State , until drastic economies and efficient denationalization of the railways release funds to swell the National Treasury . Seor Montes de Oca declared that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to state that Mexico 's external creditors are still patient . <P> Because so much now depends upon reorganization of the railways , Mexicans manifested lively interest last week in their Canadian railway doctor . Sir Henry Worth Thornton , though a Knight , and though president of the Canadian National Railways , was born in the U. S. at Logansport , Ind. , 56 years ago . Both his first and second wives were U. S. born . The Pennsylvania Railroad took him on in the Engineering Department ( 1894 ) , advanced him steadily , and in 1911 handed over to him the General Superintendentship of the Long Island railroad , a post which he had held for three years . <P> Opportunity beckoned from England , and he sailed to become General Manager of the Great Eastern Railway ( 1914-22 ) and Inspector General of Transportation ( 1919-22 ) with rank of Major-General . <P> Soon afterward the mantle of knighthood descended , emphasizing Sir Henry 's complete technical severance from his U. S. Fatherland .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
