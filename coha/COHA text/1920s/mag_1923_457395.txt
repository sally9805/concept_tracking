' Wars gets up this column , " Woman and Home " ? ' asked Mrs. Cyrus H. K. Curtis of her husband , one evening . Be had brought home to his wife the last number of a weekly , The Tribune and Farmer , which he was publishing in Philadelphia . ' I do , ' answered the husband , as he looked up from his newspaper . His wife was smiling . ' You seem to think it funny , ' he added . ' Not only funny , but absurd , ' was the answer . And then she broke into a hearty laugh . Now no man exactly enjoys having his effort laughed at , particularly by his wife . Little did Mr. Curtis realize at that moment , however , the hidden potentialities which lay in his wife 's laugh . The turning-points in our lives are sometimes very curiously brought about ! ' Excuse me , dear , ' said the wife quickly ; ' but really you do not know , as a man , how ridiculous this is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he remarked : ' Well , if you think my effort is so ridiculous , why do n't you try it , and do better ? ' ' I will , ' cheerfully answered the wife . 316 A WOMAN 'S LAUGH But little did she herself dream of what her laugh was to bring about in the life of her husband and family . The next evening , Mr. Curtis brought home to his wife a bundle of domestic periodicals from which , he explained , he had clipped ' the offending column , and now they were for her to use . Oh , no , ' replied the wife , that is not the way to do it . By that method you will never have material of your own . You must have original matter ; you must present ideas which others do not present . ' All very well , ' was the husband 's answer ; but I ca n't afford it . ' ' Oh , yes , you can , ' persisted the wife . You can always better afford to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sage remark , Mrs. Curtis wrote the column herself that week . For the following week she enlisted the help of others ; and it was not long before the column grew to a page . Comments about this page began now to be more frequent than about any other in the paper ; correspondence began to come in ; and Mr. Curtis began to regard his wife 's page with increasing interest . Why not give me more space ? ' she asked one evening . ' Make the department into a supplement . ' Mr. Curtis concluded to follow where his wife led , and a supplement was decided upon , which , while it would be supplemental to the paper , would also have an identity of its own . It was to be free to the subscribers of the Tribune and Farmer , but Mr. Curtis decided to offer it also as a separate publication , at fifty cents a year . When Mrs. Curtis had prepared the material for the first number of the supplement , and her husband had taken it to the office to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room asked him what he wanted to call the supplement . If it was to be a separate unit , he ar- AND A SINGED CAT gued , it should have a means of identification . Mr. Curtis was busy , and could not let his mind rest on this detail . So he answered : ' Call it anything you like . I do n't care . It 's . a sort of ladies ' journal . ' The composition head carried this thought to an engraver , whom he asked to draw a heading for the supplement . He did so , engraving the words , The Ladies ' Journal , as a title ; and then , to indicate the character of the contents of the supplement , added between the second and third words of the title a picture of a home , and engraved the word Home ' under it . The first subscription which came in for the supplement asked for The Ladies ' Home Journal , and all subscriptions named the periodical in like form . The success of the supplement ' was instantaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated forty-eight thousand subscriptions , the newcomer received twenty-five thou . sand separate subscriptions of its own in its first year . Mr. Curtis had a partner in his Tribune and Farmer enterprise who was not favorably disposed toward the supplement ; and it was proposed that this partner should take the weekly paper as his own , and Mr. Curtis should assume the woman 's supplement as his property . This was agreed to , the partnership was dissolved , Mr. Curtis was left with the Ladies ' Home J0111 ? nal as his sole property , and he do . cided to translate his faith in the new supplement into action . He felt in. stinctively that he had a periodical with a fundamental principle , which , with exploitation , would enter the domestic publication field , which was not ores crowded and could be occupied by the right sort of a magazine . He had , in his wife , a naturally sympathetic editor , who stood ready to do all that she could A WOMAN 'S LAUGH to make the sort of magazine that was minted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything seemed propitious for a systematic tryout of the proposition . He figured out that , while he was making the effort and spending the money to secure single subscriptions , he could just as well get them coming in groups . So he announced that , while the nominal subscription price of the magazine was fifty cents a year , where a group of four women would band together and send in their subscription in clubs of four he would accept all four for one dollar for twelve numbers . His discernment proved to be sound , for ninety per cent of his subscriptions came in clubs of four ; and after six months of effort he found his circulation of twenty-five thousand doubled to fifty thousand copies .. Iie wanted now to start a moderate advertising campaign . He consulted the advertising agency of N. W. Ayer and Son , and was met with the suggestion that the firm would like to experiment with an advertisement to be placed by it in three periodicals , the total cost to be four hundred dollars . Mr. Curtis assented to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was good . The appropriation was now conservatively enlarged , and again the results justified the investment . For , according to Mr. Curtis 's view , then as now , an advertising appropriation is not an expense , but an investment : it creates an asset in the business in name and good-will , and , as such , can not be charged as expense . In another six months , the circulation again doubled to one hundred thousand copies . More advertising now followed , and once more , within another six months , the circulation of the new paper had doubled to two hundred thousand copies . // True to his method of giving the public the best he could secure , Mr. Curtis determined to solidify his proposition by obtaining the writings of some of the best-known authors in the domestic field of that day , and then use these names in a large way in his advertisements . Mrs. Curtis was doing all the editing at home ; but with her home duties and the care of a little daughter she naturally could not travel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlist . She had been securing the best material she could by correspondence , but the more famous authors would have to be seen personally and persuaded into the pages of the newcomer in the periodical field . Mr. Curtis now set out on his quest for authors , and decided first to see Marion Harland , who was then at the zenith of her reputation as a domestic writer . She lived at Springfield , Massachusetts , where her husband had a church parish . She received Mr. Curtis pleasantly , but assured him that she was committed to other periodicals whose editors kept her busy . The new publisher finally persuaded her to let him have a story she had under her hand , and promised to pay her ninety dollars for it . When he arrived home , elated with his success , his wife met his recital with a look of alarm . Ninety dollars for how many stories ? ' she asked . One , ' replied her husband . One ? ' echoed the wife . ' Do you want to bankrupt the concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mr. Curtis had to acknowledge the justice of his wife 's remonstrance . He was barely able to pay his printing bills and overhead expenses and to meet the accounts for the advertising he was doing . No one knew better than the wife and mother how little there remained for household expenses , and the husband realized the weight of the argument that there was no money left for high-priced authors , ' who demanded ninety dollars for a single story ! ' Well , ' he decided , ' we 'll have to finance it in some way . ' And straightway he did . There was a manufacturer of an egg-beater who was an enthusiastic admirer of Marion Harland 's writings , and was always ready to advertise in those periodicals for which she wrote . Mr. Curtis went to him , told him that he had secured the manufacturer 's favorite domestic expert to write for his magazine and that he ought to advertise in that periodical . The manufacturer agreed ; Mr. Curtis sold him ninety dollars ' worth of advertising space ? ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first big editorial outlay . ' Having a well-known name to advertise , Mr. Curtis advertised it ; and another six months told once more the same story : the circulation again doubled from two hundred thousand to four hundred thousand copies per month . Flushed with his success , the publisher-editor set out on another quest for authors , and this time tried to secure such popular writers of the day as Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney , Rose Terry Cooke , Robert J. Burdette , Josiah Allen 's Wife , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps , and Louisa M. Alcott . But the road was not easy . He was courteously received by the writers , and they politely listened to him . But the fame of the Ladies ' Home Journal had not reached these writers ; all that they wrote was eagerly taken by other editors and Mr. Curtis had ' poor pickings . ' He acknowledges that it was ' a hard chase . ' But he went back to each writer and persevered . He heard incidentally that Louisa M. AND A SINGED CAT Alcott had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Alcott the energetic author-chaser returned with the proposition that he would pay one hundred dollars for a thousand . word column article for her charity . This proved too strong a temptation for the woman with a pet charity . She sent Mr. Curtis an article , and he sent her a check for one hundred dollars . Some time later , when he saw the article in the magazine , he discovered that it exceeded a column in length : it was almost two columns . He mote Miss Alcott , reminding her that he had promised her one hundred dollars per column : he had just discovered the length of her article , and enclosed another check for one hundred dollars to make good his word to her . Miss Alcott was so pleased at this that she told of her experience to other authors , who , in turn , decided that a publisher so conscientious should he encouraged . Thereafter his proposals fell on ears not quite so deaf . All this time , Mr. Curtis had in. creased his advertising rates to keep pace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized that his growth was too fast for a proper financial balance , and he decided upon the unusual course of checking his circulation . He announced that thereafter his club-offer of four subscriptions for one dollar would be discontinued , and that the subscription price would be a straight fifty cents a year . Concurrently with this decision , he announced the list of famous authors who had been engaged to write for the magazine , and promised the public a full fifty cents ' worth during a year . The public took him at his word , and increased his circulation to seven hundred thousand copies . Once more Mr. Curtis saw that he had to check his circulation , particularly as he had difficulty in increasing his advertising rates fast enough to keep up with the growth . He now decided to enlarge his magazine by doubling its size , and to raise the subscription price to one dollar per year . No one to whom he spoke of his plan approved it . The printing establishment where the paper was being printed had ordered some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the owner heard of Mr. Curtis 's determination he cancelled the order for the additional machinery . ' You have a wonderful business , growing fine , ' he said to Mr. Curtis . ' Now you 're going to spoil the whole thing . Your public wo n't follow you at the higher price . ' And to a friend the printer opined : ' Curtis 's success has gone to his head . Now he 's going to blow his whole outfit to pieces . ' Arr . Curtis well knew that if he pursued the course he had laid out for his periodical it meant a shrinkage of income until he could convince his public that his magazine was worth the new price , or could induce a new public to come to him . He realized that it would require a large expenditure of money for advertising and overhead capital to tide him over his lean period . He laid his plan before F. Wayland Ayer , of N. W. Ayer and Son , and sought his opinion . Good , ' was the verdict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word his plan had evoked . ' But I shall have to advertise widely , ' he argued , ' and I shall have to get credit for it until I can demonstrate the Alsdom of my plan to the public . ' How much credit do you think you will want ? ' asked Mr. Ayer . ' I hesitated to tell him , ' Mr. Curtis says , in recounting the conversation now , but I thought I might as well give it to him straight . ' Two hundred thousand dollars , ' answered the publisher . That does n't scare me , ' replied the advertising chief . ' But , ' he added , ' if you 're going to build up your business on such a scale you will need two other essentials : credit at some of the banks , and credit from your paper-makers . I think I can arrange both for you . ' An adequate line of financial credit was arranged at three depositories , and then it was arranged that Mr. Ayer and Mr. Curtis should take a trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , of Fitchburg , Massachusetts , who were supplying the white paper for the Ladies ' Home Journal . Mr. Curtis had dealt only for a brief period with this firm , and its members knew little or nothing of the man or his plans . A personal visit and favorable impression , therefore , were essential . The paper firm had been notified of the visit and its purpose , and the visitors were met courteously ; but they were firmly told at the beginning that their journey was futile , as the firm had decided that it could not possibly extend the desired credit of one hundred thousand dollars to the publisher . Mr. Ayer suggested that Mr. Curtis be allowed at least to unfold his plan , which might change their point of view . This was done . But the paper-manufacturers remained obdurate : they were very sorry ; they would be glad to go on as at present on a cash basis , but they could not consider for one moment the extension of so large a credit based on any plan . The conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that Mr. Curtis retire for a few moments and leave him for a private talk with the unwilling manufacturers . Mr. Curtis went downstairs to the hotel lobby , lighted a cigar and sat there for ' what I thought was hours . Then I was asked to come upstairs , and when I entered the room the demeanor of the men had entirely changed to a most cheerful mood , and I was greeted with : " Well , Mr. Curtis , you have a goodfriendhere . Wehave decided to give you thecredit of one hundred thousand dollars that you want . " ' I certainly was surprised , ' says Mr. Curtis . ' No one ventured to tell me the reason for the change of front , and Mr. Ayer said nothing on the way home . In fact , I never knew what happened , although I often wondered , until , only a short while ago , in talking with a member of the Ayer firm , the incident happened to come up , and I asked what had really happened while I was absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , " now that is so long ago , there is no reason why I should not tell you . Mr. Ayer guaranteed your notes . " ' But without that knowledge , Mr. Curtis never failed in his feeling of gratitude to Mr. Ayer . Since that eventful time , Mr. Curtis has spent millions of dollars in advertising with the Ayer firm , while , incidentally , the Crocker , Burbank firm , which still furnishes the main supply of the Curtis paper , carries ' Mr. Curtis month by month for sums that they never dreamed of , on a business amounting to millions of dollars each year . While several banks have from time to time carried Mr. Curtis when he needed it , for years he was principally carried by the advertising and paper-making concerns , the banks figuring only in a secondary way . His experience differed in this respect from that of the business man who , being told that his end was near , asked that only bankers be asked to officiate as pallbearers at his funeral , explaining that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should like to have them finish the job . Mr. Curtis had announced that the AND A SINGED CAT increase of the subscription price of the Ladies ' Home Journal to one dollar per **36;429;TOOLONG . ' I fixed that date , ' he explains , 14i. cause the summer months were always meagre in income , and I figured they might just as well be a little thinner . ' And the receipts during that summer certainly were . They fully met every expectation that Mr. Curtis may have had of being ' a little thinner , ' as the summer progressed . They grew so thin , in fact , that at times they became im. perceptible . Mr. Curtis would journey over to Philadelphia in the evenings and on Sundays , go to the Post Office , open the mail box , and see what there was in the mail . There was not much , no more than he could conveniently count , and in a very few moments . It was evident that his expiring subscribers hesitated to pay double the former price , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clientele . The critical days met by every enterprise were upon him . Many a time , ' he says now , during that period , I would go home and walk under the trees and try to figure it out . ' Did you ever doubt the wisdom of your course ? ' he was asked once . Oh , no , not for a moment . My wonder was whether my credit would hold out until the turn came . I knew it would come ; I was sure of that ; but naturally I could n't be sure when it would come . That was the problem . ' It also came about , at the same time , that the increasing care of a larger house and the attention necessary to a growing daughter , now thirteen yearsof age , began to weigh upon Mrs. Curtis and make her wonder whether she could continue with her editorship , especially in view of her husband 's deri- sion to double the size of the magazine . She pondered over the pros and cons of the situation . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have to give up this editorial work . ' Why ? ' asked the husband in undisguised surprise . Daughter said to me this morning , " Mother , whenever I see you , or want you , you have a pen in your hand . You are always busy writing . " ' That settles it , ' was Mr. Curtis 's instant reply . Mrs. Curtis felt that her husband was now well enough on his way to do without her direct assistance , and that she would be equally valuable with her counsel , if not more so , if in the future she were freed from the details of incessant editing which she had conducted for six years . Her daughter had corroborated her own instinct that she was the mother of an observing little girl ; and she was glad to turn toward a closer relation with her child . Then began a quest for an editor who could take charge of the enlarged magazine . This was accomplished in the following October ( 1889 ) , when Mrs. Curtis hand ed over I he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was destined to hold the position continuously for thirty years . With the opening autumn , Mr. Curtis started the advertising campaign for which he secured the **26;467;TOOLONG credit , only to exceed it and spend three hundred and ten thousand dollars before the winter was over . The banks allowed the publisher full credit ; the paper-manufacturers kept their contract ; but even then it was a busy time for the next year for Mr. Curtis , in meeting his different obligations and his increasing overhead . Slowly , but surely , however , he began to see his vision realized ; and before long he had the satisfaction of knowing that his subscription list was on the substantial basis of a dollar per year . He discontinued his entire premium dejurtinent ; he refused all ' cut ' rates on his magazine ; and from that time he determined to stand out for the full value of the magazine , giving full value in its en 131 ? NO o contents for the money . He pared down his advertising commissions , and literally put hishouse inorder fora simplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1891 , he decided to transfer the business to a stock company , with a capital stock of $500,000 , retain a controlling interest and , with the amount received for the balance of the stock , erect his own printing plant of presses in a new building , of which the business was sorely in need . So , on June 25 , 1891 , the Curtis Publishing Company was organized , with Mr. Curtis as President . Shortly afterward he first presses were purchased and installed on properties leased ; and the first executive Curtis building , under lease , was erected for the company in 1893 . The business now had room to grow and grow it did . The circulation of the magazine steadily increased , until it reached the figure , unheard of in those days , of one million copies per month . More properties were acquired , additional machinery was bought , and it was not long beforeeveryfootof thenew publication building was occupied and additional quarters had to be found outside . Mr. Curtis now decided that he would find a site and erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with unerring instinct he selected the square bounded by Walnut , Sixth , Seventh , and Sansom Streets in Philadelphia . The building was to face Independence Square and flank on Washington Square ? historic city squares , which would never be built up and would afford adequate light and air for a large publication business . It took a long time to acquire all the properties and erect a suitable building ; but in 1011 the present impressive Curtis Building was finished and the business was transferred to it , only to find a few years later that it had once more expanded beyond the capacity of an entire city square . Enlargements and 322 A WOMAN 'S LAUGH extensions were once more in order ; and these again have all been occupied , with every cubic foot of space in use . For , as the Ladies ' Home Journal became more widely known , its circulation began to increase beyond the million mark with greater speed than it had attained in reaching that figure . Its subsequent growth is familiar to the public . It may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into it is understood , and the increasing amounts of money , which Mr. Curtis has always been ready to invest in making the magazine better. , or in keeping not only abreast of its growth with new machinery but invariably a little ahead of it , so that the public demand should always be met in full . This was not always possible , but the attempt was consistent and insistent . It is difficult , if not impossible , to put upon paper , so that it will carry conviction to the reader , an adequate picture of the intensity of the struggle that Mr. Curtis went through in his establishment of the Ladies ' Home Journal . He had no means : he financed solely on credit . Success , viewed in the retrospect , is dangerous in that one sees only the spectacular moments and the high spots in the battle : the daily strain is lost sight of . It is easy now to say that one month the Ladies ' Home Journal had a four-hundred-thousand circulation , and a few months thereafter it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if success had come overnight , so to speak ; as if Mr. Curtis had sown in the morning and reaped in the evening . But in legitimate business success is never so achieved . Happily so , for the exhilaration is in the fight : in the feeling not so much of the length of the step as that the step is in the right direction . The hazards of business were on every side of Mr. Curtis in those days , but he never showed undue AND A SINGED CAT anxiety . Filled with the zest and love of the game , confident that his vision was true and the goal attainable , he fought on valiantly and straight to his mark . There were days when it required the keenest financial acumen to meet notes falling due at the bank , current bills , and a growing weekly pay-roll . It is not so simple as some may think to impress a large public through the types and get the conviction into the public mind that it should buy something which it does not need . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its influence . Food , clothes , coal , a public must have . It is not a bodily want that the publisher satisfies : it is a mental want . And be . fore the want can be proved , the need for it must be created . Hence Mr. Curtis 's path in those pioneer days was not simple . ' That made it so interesting , ' he says , because it was n't easy . ' Thus , born of a woman 's laugh , has come about the present-day Ladies ' Home Journal , with its astounding circulation of over two million copies each month , and its peculiar position as an institution in the American family . life of to-day . fiction of business methods . He found the same inaccurate representation of the business world in the plays he saw . All this the more strongly convinced him that there was a field , wide open and waiting , for the man who would put into the hands of business men business stories and business articles , which they would recognize as being written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would explain his idea to men , and , almost unanimously , they would disagree with him . ' Men do n't want to read about business , ' they argued . When their business day is over , they neat to read about something else . ' ' But the romance in business ! ' Mr. Curtis argued . ' There is none , ' he would be told . But he knew better . Had not his own life demonstrated the marvelous adventurous and romantic elements in business ? So he clung tenaciously to his idea . Na argument discouraged him . ' Some day , ' he thought to himself , ' I will show them the thrill and romance there is in business rightly written about . ' Patiently he bided his time . Why , or how , he came to fix upon the Saturday Evening Post as the medium through which he was to realize his pet dream , he does not remember , except that , as he says , the paper had always attracted him as he met it each week in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin Franklin . It was Franklin who , in 1728 , founded the paper under the title of the Pennsylvania Gazette . He edited and published it for a number of years , and then sold it to his grandson . Meanwhile six other papers of all sorts had been born in Philadelphia , all having as part of their title the word ' Gazette . ' So , in PM , to avoid a constant confusion of names , the name was changed to the Saturday Evening Post . The spirit of enterprise of that day must have been put into the venture , for in 1839 it had a circulation of thirty-five thousand copies , the largest circulation of that day of all the weeklies in the United States . The most famous statesmen and writers of the time were among its contributors , and it ranked as the most important publication of the day . The weekly passed through various ownerships in Philadelphia ; then it came into the hands of a resident of Brooklyn , New York , although the place of publication remained in Philadelphia ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , whose property it was when Mr. Curtis came to the Quaker City . The paper had never missed an issue since the evacuation of Philadelphia in the War of the Revolution , and its ownership was a matter of pride with Smyth . He and Mr. Curtis would often talk about the history and tradition of the paper , and it was from these chats , Mr. Curtis believes , that his interest in the weekly began and grew . From curiosity rather than from design , Mr. Curtis had the history of the paper looked up , and it was not long before Smyth acknowledged that his friend knew more about it than he himself . Its circulation was slowly dwindling . No one gave it any special attention . A newspaper reporter , in his odd moments , was supposed to be its editor , at a salary of ten dollars per week , and he scissored ' its contents or purchased material published years before . Mr. Curtis could not help feeling regret that a paper with such traditions should be allowed to run down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended doing with it , if anything ; or , if he would sell it , what it was worth . It was only a shell , but there was the tradition back of it . After all , Benjamin Franklin had founded it , and that was an asset which could be built upon . Smyth now transferred what little personal interest he had manifested in the Saturday Evening Post to a gas project in Chicago , and went there , leaving the paper in charge of a friend named Brady , to be looked after until he returned . He was to make ' his pile ' in Chicago , and then come back to Philadelphia and revivify the weekly . One day in 1897 , Brady walked into Mr. Curtis 's office , and with him was a lawyer . Smyth has passed away , ' Brady announced . ' His only heir is a sister . She will not put up any money to get out this week 's issue . You are the only man I can turn to for money . ' Then Mr. Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No copyright covered the name ' Saturday Evening Post . ' The owners had neglected to register it . If an issue was missed , if the heir did not furnish the money to get it out , anyone could take up the name . The lawyer confirmed this . Mr. Curtis said that of course he would not do anything like that . But , you see , you really have n't anything to sell , ' he remarked . ' However , I ' 11 give you one thousand dollars for the paper ? type and all . ' After some discussion , he paid one hundred dollars down , the other nine hundred dollars to be paid when he got clear title . One of the young men in the Curtis establishment was sent down with a wagon to the printing office , to bring up the stock of battered type ; and as soon as it arrived that week 's issue was thrown together and the paper put out , so as to save the right to the title by continuous publication . The imprint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand names were found to represent the subscription list ; and so accustomed were these readers to the AND A SINGED CAT reprinted material which had been of . fered them that , when Mr. Curtis substituted original matter , they promptly allowed their subscriptions to lapse ! Thus he had almost a clean slate to begin with : no subscribers and no advertisers . He had paid one thousand dollars for a title and the name of Benjamin Franklin . From the day when it was announced that Mr. Curtis had bought Benjamin Franklin 's paper , and was to transform it into a weekly for business men , lamentations were heard on even side . One after another of his friends deplored his purchase and his plan . Inside his own establishment it became known as the ' singed cat , ' and it received anything but a warm welcome . The Ladies ' Home Journal was steadily mounting in its accumulation of profits , and why should these hard-earned profits be eaten up by a weekly that , according to unanimous opinion , was destined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit only for the process of chloroforming ! Mr. Curtis was not unaware of the opposition to his new venture , both within and without his establishment ; but he kept his own counsel , and went on a quest for an editor . That was the first thing . Meanwhile , one of the editors on the Ladies ' Home Journal staff was delegated to look after the editorial fortunes of the weekly until a regular editor could be found . Mr. Curtis had , some time before , watched the editorship of Arthur Sherburne Hardy on the Cosmopolitan Magazine , and had made a mental note of his capacity in case he should at any time need an editor . The editor-novelist had made a readable magazine of the Cosmopolitan , and had built up the circulation . Mr. Curtis now recalled this impression that he had registered , and looked up Hardy , who , he found , had gone into the diplomatic service , and was United States Minister to Persia . Nothing daunted , Mr. Curtis got into communication with the minister , told him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be anywhere in the near future where he would be more accessible and they could have a talk . The minister replied that he planned to be in Paris shortly ; could gr . Curt is meet him there ? Mr. Curtis said he would , and prepared to sail . Meanwhile , a mutual friend spoke to Mr. Curtis about a young man in Boston who , he believed , had editorial possibilities within him . His name was George Horace Lorimer ; he was a son of the Reverend George C. Lorimer , eke preached in Tremont Temple , in Boston , for some years . Mr. Curtis was going to Boston on other business , promised to look the young man over , and wrote to him asking him to come to see him . When Mr. Curtis met Lorimer , the young man told him he had a business experience with the Armours in Chicago , but had left there , although at twenty-two he was receiving the unusual salary of five thousand dollars per year , because he wanted to go into journalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainbow aspirations , ' but young Lorimer persisted , went to Colby College , in Maine , where he took a two years ' course in the study of general literature , and then became a reporter for another two years on the Boston Post , which he had then recently left to devote himself to free-lance literary work . He was , therefore , in a receptive mood to listen to a propositon from Mr. Curtis , who , favorably impressed with the young man , offered ban a position ' as a young man on the staff of the Post , to do anything he oald , ' at a thousand dollars per year . Aever for a moment did Mr. Curtis ream that he had found his editor . Lorimer went to Philadelphia , took hold of what he could find to do on the Post staff , and showed such clearheaded common sense in his suggestions , in the three weeks that he had in which to show his work before Mr. Curtis sailed to Europe to meet Minister Hardy in Paris , that Mr. Curtis began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought grew upon him , and when he sailed he put Lorimer in full editorial charge of the paper until he could determine whether he could make arrangements with Hardy . But by the time I sailed , ' said Mr. Curtis , ' I did n't much care whether I got Hardy or not . I was convinced by this time that Lorimer had all the makings of an editor in him . ' It turned out that Mr. Curtis and Minister Hardy were not to meet as arranged . The State Department at Washington had ordered the Persian Minister 's transfer to Athens , as Minister to Greece . Mr. Curtis was perfectly satisfied . He felt that he had the man in Lorimer ; at all events he had given Lorimer his chance to show what he could do , and he determined to wait until his return to Philadelphia to see what the young man had done . He found his brightest expectations not only realized but exceeded . Lorimer had shown exceedingly good editorial acumen . The Post was beginning to get and print the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Lorimer that he could consider himself the editor . Mr. Curtis now got back of his editor and his pet project . He did not have to secure financial credit for the Saturday Evening Post , as he had had to do for the Ladies ' Home Journal , because the latter publication was netting a profit , and on this the Post could be carried . But it was a hard and thorny path , nevertheless . No one believed in the outcome of the venture except Mr. A WOMAN 'S LAUGH AND A SINGED CAT Curtis and his editor . Business men shook their heads , advertising men predicted absolute failure ; the organ of the publishing trade , Printers ' Ink , editorially bewailed the fact that Mr. Curtis had ' established a wonderful property in the Ladies ' Home Journal , and now he was blowing in all the profits on an impossible venture . ' Journalists assured Mr. Curtis that the day of the weekly was long past ; that the mental attitude of the public was against it ; that he was bucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of the paper-manufacturers declared that he would have to give up the Post , or it would break his own back and that of the entire establishment . Mr. Curtis listened , and regretted that nowhere could he get support for his idea , which he felt so convinced was sound . Did you ever doubt yourself ? ' a friend asked him . Not for a single moment ; I knew exactly what I was trying to do ? or I thought I did , ' he answered . You were never discouraged ? ' Never discouraged . The constant reiteration of " It ca n't be done " acted like a red rag to a bull . It made me all the more determined . The opposition stiffened my backbone . I said to myself , " I 'll show them who is right " ; because I knew all the time that I was thinking right . It was simply that I could n't get anybody to see it as I saw it , or to believe in it . ' The worst of it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million dollars was spent in advertising the periodical with little result . All right , ' said Mr. Curtis , I 'll send another quarter of a million after it , to bring it back . ' The time came when the books showed a loss of eight hundred thousand dollars . Mr. Curtis 's perturbed treasurer had gone to great pains to prepare these figures , and showed them to him , hoping that the large total would halt any further expenditure . ' Eight hundred thousand dollars Ins thus far , you say ? ' asked Mr. Curtis , looking at the bottom of the statement That 's the tremendous figure , ' said the treasurer impressively . Well , ' rejoined Mr. Curtis , that gives us a margin of two hundred thou . sand more to make a round million ' The treasurer was depressed ; in fact , he was almost broken-hearted when on the following day Mr. Curtis began to put out copy for a two-hundred-thou. sand-dollar advertising campaign . That 'll bring it up to the million , the publisher joyfully announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , Lorimer had been work ing , days and evenings , helping Mr. Curtis to realize his ambition as to the kind of paper he wanted , and was beginning to make so strong a paper that men commenced to take notice of it and wonder whether there was n't something in the ' wild idea ' after all . Advertisers were chary ; but when the circulation reached five hundred thousand copies they thought they would try it for an issue or two . ' With the public attitude changing . Mr. Curtis knew , of course , that he was winning . But he wanted to make it a fact . So , to the utter despair of his treasurer , he spent another quarter of a million of dollars on the paper . Forte-/lately , the profits of the Ladies ' Hom Journal made this possible . The ledger now showed to loss of a million and a quarter dollars on the weekly . When would the turning-point be reached ? It could n't be far off , if it was ever to come ! Mr. Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite prepared for what did happen . He had now ' fertilized the soil ' for five years , and the harvest must soon follow , he argued . And then public opinion changed , as it were , overnight . Support came with such a rush that the presses could scarcely keep up with the demand for the paper . The efforts of publisher and editor were to bear fruit . The circulation leaped , and it was not long before the announcement , ' With a circulation of one million copies , ' was blazoned forth from a cover of the Post . The first round of the fight had been won ! Publisher and editor now agreed to solidify the first million with the second , and confound records and doubt-en . A succession of the livest editorial features ; authoritative business articles ; business stories reflective of actual business conditions , followed in rapid succession . It came now to be a common desire to write for the Post . Unknown authors began to have their first efforts published , and their reputations made . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all material within its field . Its contents , week by week , were kept fresh and reflective of the moment . The circulation fairly bowled along . The advertising rates could scarcely be increased rapidly enough to keep pace with the circulation . And in an incredibly brief space of time the two-million mark was not only reached but quickly passed . From this point , the Saturday Evening Post has gone on until now it is passing the two-and-a-half-million circulation mark , and is apparently headed straight for the third million . And this is the ' singed cat ' that the best business minds tried their best to kill in the unsuccessful attempt to discourage Cyrus H. K. Curtis !
