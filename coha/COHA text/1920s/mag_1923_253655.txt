The New York City Committee of the National Woman 's Party passed a resolution of protest against unfair sex discrimination by the police in a recent raid on a dance hall in Manhattan . After the raid , the women dancers were arrested and imprisoned overnight " to protect their morals . " The men were " shooed off " without having their names and addresses printed by the newspapers , as were the women 's . Said Mrs. Marcus M. Marks : " The story was printed all over the country and then no more done about it . We do n't understand how the papers could let it go that way . "
