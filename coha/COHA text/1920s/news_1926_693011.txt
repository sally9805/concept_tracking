txt General Lincoln C. Andrews , head of the Federal prohibition forces , returned to headquarters today and replied to all questions about his reported intention of retiring with the assertion that he was " just carrying on " and was too busy with plans for reorganization to consider resigning at this . time . This reply was generally accepted as confirmation of reports that the General , at the request of President Coolidge and other officials , would remain at his post until after the elections in November , and thus save the Administration embarrassment , The chief interest here in political circles and among representatives of the Anti-Saloon League and other dry organizations has been whether General Andrews would make any final declaration about his intentions . Non-Poisonous Denaturant Sought . The much-discussed topic of the use of poisons in denaturing alcohol , and the report that many persons Had been kilted or made ill recently by thate poisons in bootleg liquor , was brought to the attention or General Andrews . He said the Government chemists hoped to find some non-poisonous denaturant which would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . It was not the policy of the bureau to demand the use of poisons in quantities which would endanger I health or kill , he said . He had heard reports , the General said , that some persons squeezed out the alcohol from a liquid heat preparation through a handkerchief and drink it . This alcohol , he said , contained about 5 per cent . of wood alcohol , and if it was true that persons went to such extremes , he did know what the answer was to the problem . His immediate task , General Andrews remarked , would be to arrange for putting into effect the agreement reached with officials of Great Britain to check smuggling of liquor into this country , and the tightening up of enforcement work at home by getting at the source of supply and obtaining better cooperation from local authorities . There are twenty-two prohibition districts , each with a Federal administrator , and it is now his intention , General Andrews said , to divide the country into five sections and have a liaison . officer for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and plans of the district administrators . One of these sections will take in the Southeastern States and extend to the Potomac River . Another , will begin at the Potomac and extend north to the New England States , taking in what he referred to as the " wetter " zone . " Disappointed " in California . There will be a sectional supervisor also in the West , who will take in California , where there was a flare up recently when Colonel Ned Green , an administrator , was indicted for embezzlement of Government-seized liquors . General Andrews said he had received only a cursory account of the troubles of Colonel Green , but the af- fair was " unfortunate " and " tremendously disappointing " to him , because he had felt that the use of retired army and navy officers was essential to effective prohibition work , as they were men who had a training fitting them to accomplish the desired results . General Andrews said he had worked hard while abroad and was tired- and needed a vacation . but whether he could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , to call a conference here of all district administrators about Sept. 10 to uisctiss plans for closer enforcement . What he wanted to do , he added , was to get these men around a table and talk over personnel , salaries and objectives . General Andrews said the agreement reached with officials of Great Britain would not have to be submitted to Congress , as it was not a treaty , and therefore he was in a position to take steps immediately to make it effective . A bureau will be established here to direct the work of cooperation , and the General will put ' Harry J. Anslinger , Consul at the Bahamas . at the head of it , if Secretary of State Kellogg consents . Mr. Anslinger was one of the experts who accompanied General Andrews to Europe . Whether similar agreements would be made with other countries General Andrews was not certain , but he thought it might depend upon whether rum runners who found it impossible to carry on the traffic under the British flag used ate flags of Germany or France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
