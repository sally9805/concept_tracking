As a rule President Harding does not set fashions . As a rule Senator La Follette does not follow a fashion which anyone else has set . It apppears that the President has set a fashion , perhaps unknowingly , and that the Senator will follow it , perhaps unwillingly . Towards the middle of June Mr. Harding will start on a speaking tour of the country , and about the same time , according to his present plans , Senator La Follette will make a similar trip . Mr. La Follette , however , will exercise his inalienable right to individuality by making a " swing around the circle " in the reverse direction to that followed by the President . <P> The President 's trip was unofficially announced some time ago . Now it is understood that he will start about June 15 and that the major stops on his journey will be St. Louis , Kansas City , Denver , Salt Lake City , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle ( here an interval for a side trip to Alaska ) , Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just announced his projected tour : " I have received so many invitations to speak from people in all parts of the country that I decided to accept some of these invitations . I hope very shortly to clean up my business here in Washington and go away for a little recreation to fortify myself physically , after which I will talk to the folks . " <P> His itinerary is not definitely settled , but is said to begin in Minnesota and continue through the Dakotas , Wyoming , Montana , Washington , Oregon , California , Colorado , Kansas , Iowa , Illinois and Indiana . The subjects of the Senator 's speeches will include the railroads , taxation , tariff and most of the topics in which the " progressives ' ' are interested . It is likely , too , that Mr. Harding will touch on most of these questions , but with decidedly different recommendations . <P> The Senator will doubtless declare for repeal of the Esch-Cummins Act , whereas President Harding will probably advocate consolidation of the railroads under the act .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
