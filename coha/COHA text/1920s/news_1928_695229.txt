Dr. Barton Defines Purpose . About 300 enthusiastic drys crowded themselves into the roof apartment of the hotel for the opening session . Bishop Cannon read the official call , which was printed in the newspapers just after the Houston convention , and the letter of invitation sent out by himself and Dr. Barton . Dr. Barton was elected Permanent Chairman and Bishop Cannon as Secretary . " I am a Democrat and therefore opposed to ? Al Smith , " Dr. Barton said in inaugurating the conference . " I think I voice the sentiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has arisen in this nation . After over . 100 years the Christian and moral forces have accomplished the greatest single reform in the history of any free people on earth . This reform will be in danger if Al Smith is elected President , which , please God , he will not be . And my family has been Democratic for generations . The party has been delivered bag and baggage into the maw of a Tammany tiger whose teeth and claws are red with the blood of every Democratic candidate for a generation . " He declared the conference must press the dry fight if what he termed the blessings of prohibition were to be retained by future generations of Americans . " We are here as individual citi zens , " Dr. Barton said . " To say that the Church is in politics because of our actions is like saying that a bank is in politics because one of its officers supports certain measures . I believe in the separation of Church and State , but we would not have had it save for the heroic action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloonkeepers welcomed the aid we gave those they had ruined . They told us we must n't get our white ties soiled by getting into politics because it was such dirty business . If it is , we 're going to clean it up . " Roll Ca ' 1 of Delegates .

South Carolina 13 , North Carolina 66 , Tennessee 15 , Texas 2 , West Virginia 12 and Virginia 17 . After the roll call had been called the conference went into executive session and the newspaper correspondents were asi-ed to withdraw . Dr. Barton said afterward that he realized the value of publicity to the cause , but that he wanted it to be " favorable publicity " According to several delegates who were not loath to discuss what transpired after the doors were closed , the official spokesmen from each State was alloted four minutes . Dr. C. 0 . Watson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greenville represented South Carolina . Dr. Watson explained that the State had a law which required those who participated in a Democratic Primary to support the entire ticket at the polls . Because of this law , Dr. Watson said that , although he was opposed to Smith , he nevertheless felt under obligations to vote for him . Similar views were expressed by Mr. Gentry who added that many " loyal Democrats " would thus be " forced " to vote for the New Yorker . At this juncture , an unidentified delegate from Spartanburg said that he was " loyal " to the party , but that he was " not going to vote for Smith . " Messrs Watson and Gentry resented this statement and , after declaring they had been officially selected to represent their State , announced that they would withdraw " rather than violate our oaths . " They marched out of the room . Bishop E. D. Mouzon of Charlotte , N. C .. insisted that they were " loyal Democrats and gentlemen " and that they return . A messenger was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference , which greeted them with a burst of hand clapping . Sees Two Democratic Parties . At an evening meeting held in the hotel lounge , there was a series of brief speeches reiterating charges that Governor Smith was a wet and that the dry forces of the South must unite in defeating him . Bishop Mouzon , who earlier in the day had issued a statement denying that the " religious issue " was raised in the conference , declared at this meeting that he would support Hoover . " The trouble is , " Bishop Mouzon said , " that two parties go by the name of Democrats , one in the South and another in the North , totally unlike in principle . I doubt if the Northern leaders know what the principles ar " The nomination of Governor Smith is the uprising of the lawless elements of the big cities against American civilization . The danger to American civilization todal is in the big cities with their alien population , their lack of moral principles and their ignorance of American history and traditions . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will last . Maybe we are at the beginning of a period that will result in the downfall of our civilization here in America . " The nomination of Governor Smith now brings about a referendum on the prohibition question . " Commenting on the conference , The Asheville Citizen , a leading Democratic daily in North Carolina , will say tomorrow : " To date it can hardly be said that the dry conference has introduced any new element into the political situation ; any element that was not there already . Of course , the gathering is not yet over and something further may come out of it , but so far it appears to represent only a getting together of certain church leaders and Anti-Saloon leaders who for months have been attacking Governor Smith 's candidacy and a reaffirmation of their opposition to his election . * * * " The point is that it is not easy to establish the grounds upon which Democrats as Democrats can be urged to vote the Republican ticket . They have not been established as yet . nor do we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
