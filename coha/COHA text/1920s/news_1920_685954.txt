txt Ford Motor Co. is turning out about 4,000 cars daily . That is , plants are producing automobiles practically at capacity . As fast as cars are turned out they are delivered to dealers . Ford itself is not storing cars . Consumptive caPacity of the dealers is enormous as may be judged from the fact that they have between $300,000,000 and $400,000.000 invested in their agencies . Despite the doubtful feeling which has pervaded the ranks of manufacturers and dealers generally of late the Ford company purposes to proceed at full capacity . It feels it has the finances to proceed , it has the organization , the materials and facilities ; if the demand is somewhat dormant for the time being it is bound to become vitalized sooner or later . When that time will come is uncertain . It is dependlent upon the farmer . When he becomes convinced that the era of high prices for his products is passed , that the trend of wheat prices must follow the way of silks , woolens , copper and other products , and decides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits , then the demand for Ford cars will be augmented . Whether it will be in three months or six months is problematical ; probably four months is the best guess . Much has been rumored about the launching by Ford in the near future of a new car , probably a six-cylinder job . What Henry Ford may do in five years or ten years is not to be predicted at this time . Projects that he is considering or even discussing may be as numerous as the proverbial sands of the sea . The Fordson tractor was being tested more than a decade ago yet it was not until the close of the war that it got production . In the year ended . Tply 31. last , 70,000 of these tractor. ; .. - ere pro ; duced : 200,000 is the mark set for the twelve months to July 31 , 1021 . No new Ford motor car will he seen in the next two years ; that much may be stated emphatically . To bring out a new car would mean the discarding of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present motor plant at Highland Park from the production of a four-cylinder job to a six . The Ford company is not forgetting its responsibility to its thousands of workmen so readily that it contemplates so radical a departure within the near future . Ford now employs in the varied automobile , tractor , steel and other plants in the Detroit field approximately 70,000 individuals . All told it has over ** employes in this country . Its payroll amounts to some $500,000 daily . About one out of every four workmen in Detroit takes his earnings from the Ford industries . No better illustration could be given of the meaning of disrupting its working forces at the Highland Park plant . It means that when , if ever , it is proposed to bring a new car into being ample notice will be given by preparations covering probably a twelvemonth . Highly as the Ford organization regards the car it produces  --  and it emphatically terms it . the best motor ear value in the world ? it does not concede it a span of life on the average in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 Ford cars traversing the highways today , it sees a replacement need for roundly 1.000,000 cars a year . If the company fills its projected program of 1,250,000 cars in the twelve months to duly 31. next , it figures it need look for only about 250,000 new car owners to take up the excess over its replacement demand . Comment that thousands of Ford owners hope to graduate to the ranks of those owning a " real car " is brushed aside with the remark that the Ford is a utility rather than a pleasure proposition and that 90 ' : ; - of its machines are used commercially . It must also be borne in mind that Ford has an export business of 200,000 cars yearly , not including the Canadian field . At a time when most motor concerns in the Detroit zone are borrowing to their capacity from banks and have curtailed or even suspended production  --  although a few are running close to capacity  --  full operations at the Ford motor plant are indicative of a strong position financially . Ford is borrowing some from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures which have appeared in gossip of the last few months . Ford 's largest banking liability . it is understood , is the $25,000,000 balance of the amount raised for the purchase of the minority stock . That transaction involved some $110,000,000 , of which $60,000,000 came from banks and the balance from the company . There are still in the . box some large amounts of Liberty bonds . There - are no corporation bonds in the company safe new . When the purchase of the minority interests was completed the Ford company holdings of corporation securities went out as part of the payment and they have not been replaced . It is indicative of Ford canniness that these securities were turned over to the seller : : of the Ford shares and thus the expense of converting them into dollars , as well as the labor involved , was avoided . If the outlook for the motor industry is as black as it has been painted in recent months  --  and some of the pictures represented almost complete oblivion  --  Ford interests say their plant will he the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Present activities do not indicate any such development as in the realm of the possible . October is credited with 99967 new cars and one working day , October 26 , with a banner output of 4.680 . Of all the country 's motor makers the Ford is the most closely allied with those who are close to the soil- It is compounded of the products of the earth  --  from ore , timber , coal . Its clientele is largely the tillers of the soil and related labor . From thorn must come the renewal of the demand for the Ford products and the Ford interests look for that day to dawn when the farmer ceases to nine after the profits that might have been and accents the prices which operation of economic laws is now establishing .
