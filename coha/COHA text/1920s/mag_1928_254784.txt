Horrid to many a small boy was a proposal made last week by Director Edward P. Smith , of New York State 's summer high schools . Let public schools be open the year round , said he , instead of on the present schedule of forty weeks or less . " Our forty-week year dates from the time when we were an agricultural people , when pupils were needed for harvesting crops . We have exactly the reverse of that condition now . "
