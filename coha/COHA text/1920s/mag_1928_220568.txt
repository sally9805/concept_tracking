Though Edison invented phonographs , his face is not yet as familiar in far-off lands as is that of a small , white , listening dog . Thus is injustice done to inventors . Was injustice done , last week , when Chairman John E. Aldred of the Gillette Safety Razor Company announced that the value of its patents had been suddenly written down from $3,459,500 to $1 ? Did that imply that the ideas of Inventor King Camp Gillette are now worth one hundred cents ? <P> Friends of Chairman Aldred smiled a negative . When he backs an inventor he does not disparage him , does not deal in little white dogs . Financier Aldred backed Mr. Gillette when he was a poor Socialist . On him he conferred eternal youth , insofar as that can be done by printing upon millions of razor-blade cartons a picture of King Camp Gillette taken in 1901 . Today Mr. Gillette has prospered so greatly that he owns a California estate where cattle and oranges are bred and grown " for fun . " He was pleased last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patents . The chief effects are two : 1 ) to cut down taxes on the declared " worth " of the patents ; 2 ) to prove that the Gillette company has no need to bolster its assets-column with the figure $3,459,500 . <P> Notice of the writing down was given , last week , in an annual statement which was unique in the number of pungent details . Some of them : 1 ) Capital stock and surplus , $43,760,162.39 ; 2 ) Earnings for 1927 were $14,580,902 as against $13 , - 311,412 for 1926 ; 3 ) Of sales progress the statement said with a lofty wobble , " Business conditions in America were somewhat varied , but the foreign business showed steady growth ; " 4 ) " Surgeons ' knives , chisels , office-knives and twine-cutters have been added to our line during 1927 ; " 5 ) " We regret to record the death during the year of one of our oldest directors , Mr. William A. Gaston . Mr. John Gaston , his son , has been elected a director to succeed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
