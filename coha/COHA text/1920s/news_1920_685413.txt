txt In rejecting Governor SMrrn 's proposed mediation the striking longshoremen have invited industrial strife . There may be wrongs on both sides , and no clear means is at hand to right the wrongs . The wages of dock workers in the coastwise lines are low , and there is an added irritant in the fact that in the deep-sea lines the same labor is better paid . Its is equally clear , however , that , whereas the deep-sea lines are prospering , the coastwise lines can not now grant an increase . As a result of wartime control they are , at least for the present , in the plight of a dying industry . A large portion of their business has been diverted to the competing railways , so that , until increased rates are granted , they would actually save money by ceasing operations . And they also have a grievance . They hold an agreement with the striking union under which its members were bound to stand by the current wage scale for six months more . If the longshoremen had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as not only Governor SMITH but President O'CONNOR of their International Association counseled , a ' way out of the tangle might presently be found . As they have refused to do this , the Merchants ' Association is undertaking to break the strike by importing not only dock workers , but trucks and truckmen . . Now the union leaders are countering by a movement to induce the American Federation of Labor to grant funds " to prevent the crushing of unionism " and " resist the " attempt which capital is making to " force the open shop . " As yet there is no question of the open shop , and if the strikers were in a mood to listen to their friends and to their international leader there would be none . The basic question is of the rights of the public as against the striker . With traffic everywhere congested and the cost of living at its peak , the unions insist on their right to lay one more burden upon tho suffering community . On the four coastwise lines , in spite of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reduced 40 per cent . Perishable goods , which the world so sorely needs , are rotting on the wharves . The question is that which Governor ALLEN lately put plainly to SAMUEL GOMPERS and which Mr : COMPERE astutely evaded . When labor declares war against capital , has the public any rights and , if , so , what are they ? . Under our present laws , labor has unquestionably the right to strike . But by the same laws the public has the right to protect itself , even though in doing so it has to break the strike . The meeting at which the longshoremen refused Governor Smrries mediation was very sparsely attended , only GU men voting out of a total membership of some 6,000 . And of these , 266 , or almost one-half , voted for the course which was urged by Governor SMITH and President O'CONNOR . Manifestly we have here one more occasion upon which action was determined by a minority of radicals , to whom the g.reat body of workers were indifferent ) r flatly opposed . Whatever happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  st of this more moderate majority to lo their utmost in preventing disturbInces.
