ALL those who have attained even a moderate success in literature must be in the way of receiving many letters like the ambition to write ? to be a writer as you are , however , mostly in fiction . I have always wanted to be an author , and the ambition grows with every passing day . There are , of course , questions that come up in my mind which I seek to have answered by writers of your position in the profession . I have written to many English and American authors , among them being John Galsworthy , Sheila Kaye-Smith , John Drinkwater , May Sinclair , James Boyd , and Sherwood Anderson ; and they have , of course , helped me very much indeed . But I should like to have your views on this question : what do you think is the best way for one such as I , who intensely desires to write , to learn to do so ? And what authors do you suggest that I read ? If you can possibly answer , I shall most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals I generally try to respond with some specific suggestions . I further point out that the writer must remember that he is one among perhaps a half million , or a million , boys and girls , all cherishing the same ardent desire and enthusiasm as he , whose competition he has got to meet and overcome and obliterate , and I considerately quote the remark of Voltaire , probably one of the most brilliantly successful authors who ever lived , " If I had a son who wanted to write , I should wring his neck out of sheer paternal affection . " At the same time I emphasize that anyone who is born to write will write , and that no obstacles , no drawbacks , no torments , no difficulties will ever turn him from his predestined path . The editor of HA PER 'S has , however , suggested to me that an account of my own prolonged struggle with difficulties of all sorts may perhaps be of some interest and value to such aspirants for literary distinction ; and it may be he is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writing profession . There is the author who at an early age blazes out into sudden and phenomenal triumph , carries everything before him through his lifetime , then practically fades away , and is little more heard of . Such a case was Thomas Moore , whose poetry was the delight of men and women for two generations , who was received and feted and flattered everywhere , from his boyhood to his old age , and who is known now only by a few relics in the anthologies and a minor place in the repertory of song . And again , there are those who triumph as early and whose glory is of a more enduring quality . There is Byron , who " awoke one morning and found himself famous " and whose fame has lasted for a hundred years , with notable variations , but on the whole with solid significance . As there are those who make a reputation early , like Mr. Kipling , and then continue to live on it for a long life and after , without much further effort , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who seem to have put forth all the genius that is in them in one form , and then , just when the world considers them worn out and exhausted , they manifest their power in some fresh field with equal brilliancy and plenitude . Scott , for example , placed himself among the first in romantic poetry for ten years . When Byron threatened to outshine him he turned to the Waverley novels and made a new form of art which far surpassed anything he had done in verse . George Sand astonished the literary world with her stories of passion and rebellion . When she had drawn all she could from this vein , she turned to the high-wrought romance of Mouprai and Consuelo , and just as the critics thought she had given her best and given her all , she developed the exquisite grace and tenderness of the Berry pastorals , which in her later middle life seemed to revive all the freshness and ardor of youth . Again , in contrast to these early successes , there are those who make their way only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteem which does not come to them till advanced life , or even till old age . It would seem as if Shakespeare 's career was a process of building of this kind . Wordsworth 's certainly was . While Moore and Byron were selling their thousands of copies , Wordsworth was selling only tens . In the same way Emerson , during his best and active years , had but few admirers and followers in comparison with the authors of " Evangeline " and " Snow-Bound " ; yet Emerson 's present position is somewhat above theirs . And there are the authors who know little of glory in their lifetime . There was Keats , whose thirst for greatness was unparalleled and who died at twenty-four , believing that his name was writ in water . There was Shelley , dying at thirty , with not even the reputation of Wordsworth at that age , and never for a moment suspecting that he would come to be reckoned among the greatest poets , not only of the nineteenth century , but of the English tongue . And yet again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the most intimate conviction of their own genius and the firmest belief that some day it will secure them immortality , while it never does . Southey , for instance , is no doubt still rated as a respectable , important prose writer . He himself proclaimed with the utmost positiveness that he would stand high among English poets . Yet who to-day reads " Thalaba " or " The Curse of Kehama " ? With those titles who could ? And beneath and behind all there is always the half million , or the million , or the countless numbers , like my fifteenyear-old correspondent , who with touching simplicity start with the determination to be great writers . Where do they end ? Some in the poorhouse , some in the insane asylum , some behind the counter , some behind the plow , and some continuing the mad , hopeless , intoxicating dream until they die . My own case may perhaps not be included in the class of complete failures , since I should obviously not have received letters like that of my young correspondent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as I look hack over the past fifty years , it seems to me that I see little hut difficulties , drawbacks , checks , rebuffs , discouragements . No doubt this is because of a complete lack of the mysterious element of genius , which at once swept the Scotts and Byrons and Sands into the highest heaven of glory and enabled the Wordsworths and the Shelleys to establish a secure place there in the end . In default of such genius , I have been obliged to gain the success that has come to me by unfailing , undying , indomitable persistence . I was talking with Robert Frost not long ago and we agreed that , so far as we had observed the matter , the quality which led most to success in the literary life , perhaps in any life , was just this , of plain sticking to it . Of course , if you have n't a certain gift , no amount of obstinacy will answer ; but in so many cases a gift THE FIGHT that is really admirable is lost and thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles , irritating snubs divert and disconcert the proud or the indolent , and a long hope and a lofty aspiration are disregarded for the trifling distractions of every-day existence . But , as I look back , I am astonished to see how early the literary passion took hold of me and with what undiminished ardor it persisted through every variety of drawback that could be conceived . Many centuries ago the philosopher Jerome Cardan said of his early days and his lofty hopes ; " This one thing I know , that from my earliest childhood I burned with the desire of an immortal name . " Earliest childhood is a vague term ; but when I was thirteen or fourteen years old , and wrote my first tragedy , I began to conceive the dream of rivaling Shakespeare and I never relinquished it , in one form or another ; and I shall not until I die . There is perhaps some exaggeration in the verses I once wrote on the subject , but there is a vast deal of truth : Ever since I can remember I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a name in story . When my mates were only eager for their sport or game or pastime , I was thinking , thinking , thinking , of a name that should outlast time . And the passion is even more reflected in the words of my youthful journal , at the age of nineteen , crude , immature , and cheerfully ? or tragically ? sophomoric , as you would expect them to be , but stamped with genuine feeling , all the same : " I have staked my life upon one desire , one effort , one passion . It is no fleeting whim , born of the hour , no butterfly fancy , or ambitious dream , such as i every youth of intellect and taste must know . It is a matter of life and death with me . It has become a passion round which all else must revolve , and with which my heart beats or breaks . It seems as if such intense , overpowering desire , such constant labor as mine could not fail to achieve their object . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not be a great poet , I shall commit suicide , or die in a madhouse . " None of the alternatives has been realized as yet , but a lot of things may happen in a few brief years , and I have at last come to learn that nobody is really great until after he is dead anyway . Meantime , while the goal and the glory and the success may seem as far off as ever , the accumulation of obstacles and difficulties which have been overcome and put behind me seems , as I look back , so great , so insuperable , that I wonder my courage and persistence were not worn down and blighted long ago . II Oue mighty and ruinous difficulty I have never had to contend with seriously , and this difficulty , to many aspirants , is so blighting and so final that they may well feel that I know nothing of what the bitterness of the struggle is . In all my efforts at a literary career I have never had any profound anxiety as to where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any desperate need of money . When you realize how many great careers have been destroyed by pot-boiling , how many geniuses have been driven to despair by the absolute necessity of keeping themselves or far worse ? those they loved from starvation , it seems as if one who was free from such necessity , who was never obliged to worry himself as to where food and clothing were to come from , ought not only not to complain , but ought surely and early to succeed , if he had any of the elements of success in him at all . It is hard to tell which is more trying , the lot of the man who throws himself into literature as his only means of support and accepts poverty and privation so that he may devote himself to the one pursuit he loves , or that of the teacher , or the clerk , or the book-agent who accepts such positions so that his family may not starve , and all the time cherishes the dream of combining with them the literary achievement that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of assured fair material comfort , I do not think I had much to assist or encourage me in my literary aspirations . I had no particular sympathy in my own family . My father was a highly cultivated man who knew the great writers of the world . He was also himself an admirable speaker and writer and he imparted to me a certain lucidity of thought and energy of expression . But he had no desire whatever to see me an author . He would have liked to have me an able man of business , as he had himself been , or possibly active and useful in public affairs . Failing that , he did not much care what I did . But he had always looked upon a painter or a musician as the most contemptible of vagrants and Bohemians , and I do not think he regarded an author as being much better . Nor had I any of the associations of companionship which naturally encourage literary aspiration . My playmates were interested in business , or sport , or practical affairs , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of the hopes and desires that were burning in my soul . I never did speak of such things to anyone ; and the wonder is that , under the circumstances , the burning went on as it did ; yet perhaps the very circumstances were just what made it smolder and blaze . The most persistent , the most besetting of all the drawbacks which thwarted my literary career , the drawback which hampered it long before it began , was that of ill health . My mother and six or eight of her brothers and sisters all died of tuberculosis before they were thirty . My younger brother was carried of by the same plague at the age of nine . I lived in intimate association with him during the last months of his illness , and there seemed every reason to expect that I should follow the rest of my family . The scars now remaining on my lungs show that the danger was real and serious . Everybody took the greatest possible pains to keep me alive , but nobody really expected to succeed . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in every way , could hardly take my future very seriously when he was convinced that I should not have any future . What was the use of educating the grave ? Therefore , in my childhood I was knocked about from one school and one teacher to another , was much of the time in no school at all , and could not be said to have ever had any genuine , systematic education . I educated my- i self , by vast , vague , utterly erratic reading ; and a very uncertain , unstable , and amateurish affair it was . As I used to put it , not unfairly , I was educated by ill health and a vagrant imagination ? not a very practical method of preparing for the battles of the world . The climax of the vagrancy came when I was fifteen years old . When it was just time for me to settle down to serious study , if I ever hoped to get anywhere , I developed an alarming cough , and my elders decided that the only salvation would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year . This nearly finished me . I hated Europe . I hated traveling . I hated foreign food and foreign manners ; and general homesickness , restlessness , and disgust came nearer bringing about the end than actual disease . Spiritually I suppose I learned something of the world and life , but the disruption of all settled habits more than made up for this . When I returned from Europe and had taken another year to get back to where I was before I started , I set myself vigorously , with an excellent tutor , to prepare for college . I managed to get in , creditably enough ; for I had a fair intelligence when I was disposed to use it . And again the collapse . I really hoped college would set me on my feet , would give me the intellectual and literary start which I was beginning to long for . Before I had been in college a month my health gave out wholly and hopelessly ; and it was quite evident that that avenue to success was completely closed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that the ordinary pursuits and activities of men were out of my reach . It was the same over and over , in everything I tried . My father would have liked to have me do something in the business world and , as college was impossible , he took me in his office for the few hours each day that my strength was equal to . But I hated business and everything connected with it . Even if I had loved it , of what use was it to enter the battle of Wall Street with only strength sufficient for two hours ' work a day ? I soon gave up the vain effort and settled back into the same old story of solitude , seclusion , introspection , and always books , books , books . Perhaps the real secret and the real trouble was that I loved it so . When I was forced to mingle with men , I managed it . When I was thrown among them , I liked them and enjoyed them , and I do not think they disliked me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , and I fear I always shall have , an enormous preference for my own society to that of anyone else ; and sooner or later most of us seek the things we really prefer . III All that is important in this story is of course the bearing of the matter of health upon my literary aspiration and effort . It can not be denied that a certain fragility of physique has definite advantages from this point of view . In the first place , when you know how to use it judiciously , health affords an admirable excuse . I have cultivated this always , to the fullest extent , so that many people think that I have quite health enough for doing anything I want to and never enough to do anything I do n't . I hope this view is exaggerated . But it is certainly true that ill health has helped me to avoid a great many of the interruptions and distractions that make many literary careers difficult , if not impossible . Public duties and responsibilities are pressed upon me . Occasionally I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am not well enough . It seems contemptible , but it throws the burden on someone else . Any man or woman who succeeds with literature has hundreds of calls to join time-consuming societies , to give lectures and talks all over the country . These things are , sometimes , amusing and , sometimes , profitable . More often they are tedious , wearisome , and irritating . I have escaped them practically altogether . And the positive advantage consequent upon this is that one can work steadily and uninterruptedly and can , therefore , accomplish a considerable amount in apparently a very limited time . I have never been able to work more than two or three hours a day at most , often less ; but by sticking to this program with resolute persistence , by allowing no outside distraction to interfere with it and no temporary indisposition or spiritual reluctance to draw me away from my desk A4 when the proper time came for approaching it , I have managed to pile up a list of books which from the point of view of mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to me , none of these minor advantages in any way makes up for the terrible handicap which illness chiefly imposes on you , that of cutting you off from life . For the literary man ? not for the scholar ? but for the literary man , who looks upon his work as an art , nothing is more important than contact with the world : to watch men live , other men , all men , to know how they live , rich and poor , high and low , virtuous and vicious , to enter into their lives and understand them and live them , first of all , before he undertakes to describe them . I have vainly tried to make up for this handicap by asserting , by believing , as in a certain sense I do , that any one life is an epitome of all lives , and that in one 's own soul one can find and study and reproduce the essence of humanity as it affects and constitutes all the men and women who ever lived . This sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been the basis of all that is of any enduring value or significance in my work . But besides the fundamental identity , there is the vast , the variegated , the picturesque superficial difference , which to the unthinking casual observer constitutes practically the whole of life . It is this widely varied surface , and consequently the quick and keen and sure portrayal of it , that I have missed ; and that lack , owing mainly to the drawback of ill health , has been the ruin of the supreme aspiration which in literary matters for me has dominated all the others . As a creative writer I have been a dismal and pitiable failure . And it can not be denied that creative writing , to the literary artist who aspires to be a weaver of beauty in words , is the chief , if not the only thing that counts . You will note that my young correspondent , whose letter I quoted in beginning , says , I want to be a writer as you are , however , mostly in fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , and my feeling to-day is not in any respect different . It was only because I could not be a poet , or a novelist , or a dramatist that I took up with a dull and prosaic second-hest . Therefore , my first efforts , and for some years my only efforts , were in poetry . I wrote long poems and short poems , light poems and heavy poems , grave poems and gay . The odd thing was that I wrote for myself and made little attempt at publication . My solitude was so complete , I had so little contact with the literary world and so little encouragement , that it did not occur to me that there might be a possible market for my wares . When I did , timidly , begin to send out one or two , the receipt of the deadly printed slip of rejection , " the editor thanks you , but is alreadywell supplied with this kind of material , no unfavorable comment is intended , " froze my courage so entirely that I put my verses back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those printed slips , which still come , give me the same feeling of numbing , paralyzing irritation which they gave me then , carry with them the desolating inference that I had better be selling patent-medicines than dabbling in literature . I shortly turned from poetry to novels , poured all my passionate aspiration , literary and other , into an autobiographical romance . No publisher would look at it . Probably it was as well for me that they did not , but the total and blighting rejection was just as disheartening , for all that . I wrote a novel dealing with a young and earliest minister 's loss of belief ; for in those days religion was still a power in the world . Just as I finished it , Mrs. Ward 's Robert Elemere appeared and , though I had never heard of it , it made my book seem a palpable and futile imitation . I then wrote three other novels , which got published somehow . The first paid its way and had a little notice ; the others died before they were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . My unconquerable obstinacy refused to yield even so , and I tried more novels . I still try to dispose of one occasionally to some innocent publisher who asks me for some of my productions . He smiles and stretches out his hand eagerly . In a few weeks ? or months ? the manuscript comes back , with vague expressions of civil regret and tactful explanation . The one that pleased me most was the delicate comment of the publisher who , after enlarging on all sorts of excellent points , remarked that he did not think the book could be sold " in commercial quantities . " Can you beat it for charm ? Commercial quantities ! There will be no other test for the poor author to the end of the world . I was even foolish enough to waste my energy for years in the most hopeless and gigantic undertaking that can delude THE FIGHT any author , the one that fooled Henry James out of some of the best hours of his life , the theater . Can you imagine anything more absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived than to hurl himself against the barriers that surround dramatic success ? Yet I have in my drawer some fifteen plays , only one of which ever struggled into print ? at my own expense ? while not one of them has ever come within speaking distance of the stage . For ? to me ? the fascination of such work is simply irresistible . Never have I known more delightful hours than those when , ten years ago , I poured my whole soul into the production of a five-act comedy in verse which was assuredly to win the prize in some two-penny contest or other . The prize went to a play which was never acted or printed , by a writer who has never since been heard of . At any rate , it did not go to me . No doubt my utter failure in all these creative lines is owing to an utter lack of genius for them . But I like to console myself with the possibility that it may be owing in large measure to the accursed limitation of health and the consequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , real life , out of the mouths and hearts of men . Men speak plays and laugh plays and live passionate plays , in the world right about me every day -- I am told they do ; but I am prohibited from turning these plays of vital fact into the plays of high-wrought art that I ought to be able to make out of them because I can only think and never live . The curious feature of it all , from the purely psychological point of view , is that I am wholly incapable of judging my creative work myself . Of course the phenomenon is common to authors generally , to all types of artists ; but I do n't know that the psychological curiosity is any the less on that account . To me my poems and novels and plays appear to have qualities of unusual and distinguished excellence . Take the creation of character . The testimony of a certain number of interested readers , even of a certain sale " in commercial quantities , " would seem to evince that I have a fair power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and make them live . To me it appears that I have reasonable success in doing so . One character especially , a working over in all sorts of ancient and modern phases and aspects of the delightful ideal Shakespearean fool , to me has the stamp of creation in many incarnations . All this party and his fellows win from the publishers ' readers is the remark that he can not be sold " in commercial quantities . " I make these statements with no spirit of bitterness or complaint , simply to indicate to those who are treading the path of literary effort the difficulties and obstacles and , perhaps worst of all , the puzzles that are bound to meet them at every turn . There were of course times when even my obstinate zeal for literary achievement and success gave way under the strain . Again and again I said to myself , what is the use , when you can never be sold " in commercial quantities " ? You have tried through youth and early life . If there were an atom of genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not give it all up and lie in the sun and watch the ravishing world drift by with no effort to immortalize yourself by interpreting it ? I quote one passage from a letter written thirty years ago to show how prostrating such moods were ? while they lasted : " 1 say to myself , what earthly use is it , risking one 's health and keeping oneself in a state of worry and excitement when there is n't the slightest hope or chance of accomplishing anything for oneself or anybody else , when both public and publishers have shown so unequivocally that they care for nothing I do , and even if my books should squeak through a doubtful publisher 's hands , no human being would ever look into them or care for them ? It leaves life a little blank at first , and it is curious how suddenly near the removal of any such future preoccupation seems to bring one to death ? one stands right on the very brink of the precipice with just a faded rose or two here and there to pluck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps there was something in Voltaire 's expression of paternal tenderness . But these intervals of discouragement , or anticipatory death , were comparatively rare , and they did not last long . I grew restless , discontented , uneasy ; and the lure of the desk and the pen soon proved irresistible . From another letter , written soon after the preceding , I take a passage which shows how violent and engrossing the transition always was : " The plague of literature is upon me and I have fallen back into the very worst stages of play-dreaming and playplanning . It fascinates me like drink . I ca n't get away from it . . . . Nothing appeals to my ambition like the idea of success on the stage , the wild intoxication of an excited , crowded , applauding house ? there still seems to he nothing in life to equal it , and I am anxious to keep struggling and struggling for it , even though the chance of getting it is so very , very small. - There would come some little gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a pleasant word , or an insinuating editor would hold out some vague hope of future acceptance , and instantly my imagination was on fire , and I was back with renewed ardor at the desk . As I recall those days , it seems to me that the matter of personal influence , of " pull , " has meant very little in my case . Rarely there has been some slight advantage of personal relation with an editor or publisher . I have used these things without remorse when they came in my way , all the time despising myself for doing so , and all the time keenly realizing how much they may count for and how far they go in the making of many considerable careers . No doubt , if I had had access to them , I should have availed myself of them to the full . As it is , I feel that whatever little I have accomplished has been bysheer effort of patience and persistence on my own part , and favoritism and support and patronage have had little to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle years . The hope of every form of creative literature grew dimmer and more elusive . But occasionally an editor would show mild interest in my critical efforts , and finally I told myself that if I was ever to succeed , I must find some new , special line , in which what gifts I had , if any , would have more chance than in the novel or the play . As so often happens , almost by sheer hick I at last hit upon such a line , when I was nearly fifty years old . To my intense astonishment editors and publishers responded with cordiality , if not with enthusiasm , and though the response of the public was slow and limited , it was solid , steady and , what was more important , increasing . Thus , at an age when I should have been considering the grave or the old people 's home , I found myself an author of sufficient distinction to get letters from aspiring boys . Even so , the success has been far from continuous and , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luring , tantalizing , mocking spectral shadows of the novel and the stage teasing me from a distance . What if my plays should be acted and my novels sold " in commercial quantities " long after I have gone away ? Again , though my writing in my chosen line has had some success , that of others has had infinitely more . I would not take one jot away from them . I realize keenly that if they succeed better , it is because they better deserve to . All the same , when their books sell " in commercial quantities " and mine do not , it leaves a certain sting . And always there are those damnable letters of rejection , sometimes regretful , sometimes polite , sometimes indifferent , but never received without a momentary qualm of despair . And always there is the desperate struggle with health . There have been months and years when writing was simply impossible . There have been other years when it was worse than impossible , in that you could force yourself to do it and did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an almost nauseating disgust . There were years when a prostrating aural vertigo , like that of Dean Swift , made it dangerous to leave the bed at all , and I hardly dared imprison myself under the typewriter for fear of getting caught and cramped in an intolerable position for hours . There were years when nervous fatigue and insomnia seemed to make all intellectual effort out of the question , and when fifteen or twenty minutes a day of actual writing was the most I could accomplish . Naturally , the physical limitations , as a whole , do not diminish with time ; and it is to be expected and accepted with such equanimity as you can command that just when opportunity comes to you , when the world seems beginning to listen eagerly , you are losing your power of supplying that which would give the world pleasure . With the physical incapacity grows the haunting doubt as to whether mental capacity is not failing also . So long as you had the best of life before you , or at least not behind , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no reason why the spirit should not respond with superb nonchalance , in spite of the failure of the flesh . But it seems as if the creeping decay of age must undermineflesh and spirit both ; and you are at least sure that you yourself will be the last to whom such undermining will be perceptible . And back of these personal doubts , there is the larger question , is it worth while anyway ? The farmer , the merchant , the mechanic , even perhaps the teacher and the preacher and the politician , are of obvious use in the world . But the author ? We are swamped , buried , smothered under the multiplicity of books . Nobody can read even the smallest portion of the good books that already exist . What possible excuse can there be , then , for afflicting the world with more ? Thus , at moments , when one has sacrificed one 's health and one 's vigor and one 's money and one 's happiness in achieving a career , one is forced to admit to oneself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So one comes back to Voltaire 's pleasant resolution to dispose of his offspring from sheer paternal tenderness . Yet , as the boy of fifteen writes me that he is determined to become a great writer , so I felt at fifteen , and so I feel at sixty-five , and so I shall feel at eightyfive , if I have the misfortune to live so long . The unconquerable , ineradicable , imperishable instinct persists through every difficulty and every obstacle to the end . It is simply the incorrigible impulse to fling out against the encroaching darkness of oblivion the splendid gesture of life , which probably is all there is of life and always will be .
