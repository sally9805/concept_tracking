The reorganization of the court system of Soviet Russia , according to the latest reports from Moscow , abolishes the special workmen 's tribunals set up in the early days of the Revolution , and also does away with the Cheka , the most notorious of the terrorist institutions for enforcing Communist dictatorship . <P> The tribunal which will now take the place of the Cheka is a criminal court , in which many Communist features are still retained . There will be two jurors who will sit beside the judge and the fate of the prisoners brought before them will be decided by a vote of these three . <P> The old Russian legal code , disrupted by the abolition of private property , and made still more unstable by the recent partial restoration of property rights , is now considered to be incomprehensible to lawyers and Communists alike .
