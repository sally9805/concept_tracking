An eleventh hour attempt to swing South Africa 's coming General Election by virtually disenfranchising the Negroes of Cape Colony was made last week by Prime Minister James Barry Munnik Hertzog . " We have paused on the brink of a sure and certain abyss , " read a Hertzog manifesto , " and the question is : Shall the white race in Africa plunge down to final destruction ? " As alternative General Hertzog offered to Parliament a bill which would deprive the Cape Province Negroes of their present " equal franchise , " but would permit them to separately elect five white M. P.s-whereas they have had a deciding vote in choosing at least twelve M. P.s heretofore . The Cape Province blackamoors are all partisans of Prime Minister Hertzog 's deadly rival , General Jan Christiaan Smuts . <P> As the measure neared a vote , last week , General Smuts flayed General Hertzog for dragging the great and vital " race question " into party politics . Every South African election is bound to be just another dogfight between Generals Hertzog and Smuts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about the fact that throughout the Union of South Africa white skins are in a minority of one to four . That is the " race question , " and it may well trouble every British paleface from the King-Emperor down . <P> " The British Empire is the greatest force for good the world has ever seen and possibly ever will see ! " exclaimed General Smuts to correspondents , " The greatest problem before South Africa is the living together in peace and cooperation of a white and a black population . . . . If we fail in its solution , our white population is doomed in Africa , and this continent will continue on its road of immemorial barbarism ! " <P> Only a trained ear would detect in this powerful pronouncement the fact that General Smuts was weasling and must weasle every word he says about the " race problem . " True , the Negroes of Cape Colony vote for him , but they are the only blacks in all South Africa who are enfranchised ; and in all the other provinces General Smuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving their blackamoor neighbors the ballot . <P> Seldom has there been a national political situation more grotesque . General Hertzog remains Prime Minister by virtue of a slim , coalition majority in the House of Assembly-a majority constantly threatened by the Negro-elected Cape Province M. P.s . In the Senate the Smuts party reigns supreme , holding 25 seats out of 40 . Thus the House and Senate negate each other on almost every important bill , and showdowns must be constantly had under the Constitutional provision that both chambers shall sit , fight , and vote jointly when unable to come to an agreement as separate bodies . The bill which Prime Minister Hertzog was trying to jam through last week , contained an especially neat little joker which would have given the never-yet-enfranchised Negroes outside of Cape Province the right to elect three Senators . Of course these blackamoor-elected Senators would be Hertzog men , and would cut down the Smuts majority in the Senate . At the same time the Smuts blackamoor-elected following in the House would be cut from 12 to 5 as previously explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
