The action is well cared for by Allen Kearns ; he is required to represent a character whose name , as may be guessed , is an Indian greeting and who loses his love and gains her again with nonchalant devices of gallantry . Ben Bernie , who is justly celebrated for his ability to guide musicians with his left knee or a baton , contributes constantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
