Subtitle 1 ( FADE IN ON ) The Heath farm on the outskirts of the college town of Darienne. 1 . EXTERIOR HEATH FARM : This is a long shot of the Heath farm taken from the field which Dave Heath is engaged in plowing . To make this farm yield enough to clothe and feed a large family requires unremitting toil on the part of Dave , who so far has kept the farm in good condition . Dave halts the plow , takes off his hat and mops his brow . 2 . HEATH LIVING ROOM This room is a combined living and dining room . The furniture is of a kind that ordinarily would be found in a house situated on a farm which only continued labor could make pay . Although the furnishing are of the ordinary kind , yet everything is kept spick and span . The table is already set for the noonday meal . In a corner of the room , between two windows , sits Mrs. Heath with her work-basket in her lap .  --  2  --  Subtitle 2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UP ON MRS . HEATH Mrs. Heath is sorting out some handkerchiefs and places them in a workbasket which she puts to one side . Then she resumes work on a sweater she is making for John Trevor ; a senior in the college at Darienne and one of Mary Heath 's greatest admirers . Mrs. Heath is a kindly woman but has a high sense of duty . If at times she seems unreasonably stern , it is only because of this inborn idea of duty , as she sees it . Subtitle 3 :  --  Her daughter , Mary  --  Lucille Ricksen 4 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY  --  HEATH KITCHEN Mary is standing near the window by the kitchen sink , cutting bread for the noonday meal . She is a very winsome girl of about eighteen years of age , with lustrous brown eyes and curly hair which hangs down her back in wavy ringlets . Suddenly mary looks up from her task and gazing intently off scene toward the door which joins the living room and the kitchen , sees  --  5 .

It looks about the table longingly and  --  3  --  then , apparently unobserved , proceeds to investigate matters a little more closely . 6 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY  --  HEATH KITCHEN Into Mary 's eyes comes an amused twinkle as she closely watches to see what the dog is about to do . Although her attention is riveted on the dog , she continues to slice the bread slowly . 7 . CLOSE SHOT ON TABLE AND CHAIR  --  HEATH LIVING ROOM The dog , now thinking that it is not being observed , puts its paws up on the table and sniffs around for something to eat . It now puts its muzzle on the table cloth as if trying to overturn one of the dinner plates to see if anything is hidden there . 8 . HEATH KITCHEN Mary takes down a dish towel which hangs on a nail above the drain board of the sink and , smiling , quietly tiptoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuspecting dog . 9 . HEATH LIVING ROOM Shooting toward corner of room where Mrs. Heath is still seated , working on John 's sweater and tipping in the table and the chair upon which the dog stands . As Mary enters on tiptoe , Mrs. Heath quickly looks up but Mary puts her fingers to her lips  --  warning her mother not to make any noise . Still  --  4  --  moving noiselessly , Mary maneuvers herself into a position directly back of the chair where she can not be seen by the still unsuspecting dog . Suddenly she seizes the back of the chair and shakes it violently , dumping the dog off on the floor . As the dog springs down , Mary strikes at him with the dish towel , thus adding to his confusion as he hurriedly exits from the scene . 10 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY  --  LIVING ROOM Mary stands there looking at the fast vanishing dog . At first she tries to look serious as though the dog were a grave offender ; but then the humor of the affair strikes her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action here so as to bring out the fact that Mary is a sweetly sympathetic girl , with an eye open to the amusing things in life . Section Details 11 . WINDMILL IN HEATH FARMYARD This windmill is in the Heath farmyard about fifty feet or so from the farmhouse , and is built above one of the out buildings which is almost completely covered with vines . From the ground to the little platform just beneath the vanes of the windmill runs a ladder , formed by nailing cross cleats to one of the timbers supporting the mill . Paul and Patsy , the Heath twins , enter the scene , running from the farmhouse to the foot of the ladder , prepared to climb to the platform . At the time there is not sufficient breeze blowing to  --  5  --  turn the mill so that the blades are immobile . As usual , Paul and Patsy are on mischief bent  --  although they are continually in some sort of trouble , yet they are greatly loved by all the members of the Heath family who seem destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins to launch themselves into another . 12 . CLOSE SHOT ON TWINS  --  WINDMILL Paul and Patsy have now come to the foot of the ladder , preparatory to climbing to the platform high above their heads . Their eyes shine with roguishness , for they know that they have been forbidden to climb this ladder . This adds zest to their enterprise . Now with Paul in the lead they begin to climb , Patsy bravely following her daring little brother . They struggle upward from one cleat to another for the cleats are some distance apart , and it is no easy matter for the twins to stretch their little legs so far . However , undeterred by such a minor difficulty as this they continue to climb higher and higher . 13 . WINDMILL IN HEATH FARMYARD The twins continue to climb upward , never once glancing down at the ground which is getting further and further away , adding greatly to their peril should they , by any chance , slip and fall . Paul , being a boy , is a  --  6  --  much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl is dressed in a suit of rompers and these do not interfere with the free movement of her little legs as she follows her brother with a grim determination . 14 . CLOSE SHOT ON WINDMILL PLATFORM Paul slowly comes into the scene and , clinging to one of the cleats of the ladder with one hand , pushes open the trapdoor with the other . After some difficulty , he succeeds in pulling himself through the opening in the platform and then leans down to assist Patsy , grabbing her by the seat of the breeches portion of her rompers . Soon they are both safe on the platform . Section Details 15 . SIDE PORCH  --  HEATH FARMHOUSE Mary comes to the door , looking for the twins to wash them for the noonday meal . Now she comes to the porch and , seeing some cute little chicks huddled together there , stoops down and picks up one of them . 16 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY HOLDING CHICK A very pretty shot of her here as she holds the chick in both her hands . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fluffy thing . Now she snuggles it close to her neck . Hold sufficiently long to get over the idea that Mary is a very kind-hearted girl with a wholesome sympathy for the helpless and for those in trouble . This  --  7  --  will help to make clear her attitude toward John Trevor later in the story . 17 . CLOSE SHOT ON WINDMILL PLATFORM Paul is now standing up while Patsy is seated , intently watching her heroic little brother . Paul now goes over to one side of the platform and , clinging to the vanes of the windmill with one hand , bravely , though recklessly , stands on one foot on the platform 's edge . Patsy seems much impressed with the " stunt " of her little brother but is content to remain seated where it is a good deal safer . 18 . WINDMILL IN HEATH FARMYARD This is a still longer shot of the windmill , taken so as to tip in a large part of the yard . Paul is still balancing on one foot on the edge of the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 . CLOSE SHOT ON WINDMILL PLATFORM Paul still balancing on one foot and having noted the impression for bravery that he has made on Patsy says , rather contemptuously : Subtitle 4 :  --  " Aw , that 's nothing  --  I 'll show you a good trick . " ( Scene 19 continued . ) Now Paul puts his hands upon the platform 's edge and prepares to stand on his hands . Patsy is greatly excited and tries to grab him by the leg , but Paul is determined to show her " his good trick . " After several attempts which result in  --  8  --  failures , he finally succeeds in standing on his hands . His position is an extremely perilous one and little Patsy is rightly worried . 20 . BACKYARD  --  HEATH FARMHOUSE Mary is discovered near the back door of the farmhouse , looking anxiously across the fields for the twins . The noonday meal is nearly ready ; the twins have not had their faces and hands washed , and she can find them no place although she has hunted high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WINDMILL PLATFORM Not satisfied with having accomplished the trick of standing on his hands , Paul now tries to stand on his head . After two failures , he succeeds ; but in doing so he spins around on his head , loses his balance and drops over the side of the platform . By a near miracle he manages to catch hold of the edge of the platform as he falls . Hanging by his hands , he is not able to draw himself up to the platform again , but at last succeeds in getting a foothold on one of the cleats of the ladder . 22 . WINDMILL IN HEATH FARMYARD Mary is now standing in the backyard near the windmill , still looking for the missing twins . Paul is still hanging by his hands to the edge of the platform , and seems on the verge of losing his hold and falling to the ground . Suddenly Mary 's attention is attracted to the children above her . She turns quickly and looks up .  --  9  --  23 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY  --  SOFT EDGED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified when she sees the predicament in which Paul has got himself . For a moment she does not know what to do . Her mouth is open and her eyes staring in the shock of her discovery . 24 . BACKYARD  --  HEATH FARMHOUSE Mary starts toward the ladder and begins to climb to rescue her little brother . Moments seem like hours now as she fears that Paul 's strength will give out , forcing him to let go his hold on the platform . 25 . CLOSE SHOT ON WINDMILL PLATFORM Patsy , greatly alarmed at Paul 's perilous position , has come to his aid and , with all the strength at her command , is trying to help him back to the platform . First , she tries to pull him to safety by his hair . Now she seizes one of the suspenders of his jumpers ; and , what with her pulling and Paul 's struggles , the little boy at last manages to drag himself over the platform 's edge to safety . Paul has had a narrow escape , but does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a day 's play . 26 . CLOSE SHOT ON MARY  --  LADDER As she looks up and sees that Paul is again back on the platform , Mary stops climbing up the ladder . With a sigh of relief , she calls to them , telling them to come down immediately .  --  10  --  27 . CLOSE SHOT ON WINDMILL PLATFORM Paul is much more afraid of Mary 's wrath than he is of falling off the windmill platform . When he hears her call and realizes that she is coming up the ladder to get him and Patsy , he makes haste to remove the trapdoor so that they can descend . Patsy starts to crawl through the opening . 28 . CLOSE SHOT ON MARY  --  LADDER Mary climbs up another cleat of the ladder , but now comes to the realization that the twins are well on their way to safety and that they are no longer in need of her assistance ; so she stands there , watching them to assure herself that they will come down all the way to the ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform again . Having got them started to safety , she intends to wait and see that they arrive safely . 29 . CLOSE SHOT ON WINDMILL PLATFORM Patsy carefully descends the ladder . As soon as she has released her hold on the upper cleat , Paul climbs through the opening in the platform and , being careful not to step on Patsy 's hands , slowly makes his way down the ladder . Section Details 30 . SMALL BRIDGE OVER CREEK This is an ordinary wooden bridge spanning a small creek near the Heath farm  --  such a bridge as would be found in the country where the load would never exceed horses or  --  11  --  light wagons . The bridge has no side rails , but the planking is fairly heavy . Seated on the bridge , with his feet dangling over the side and with a can of angle worms at his side , is one of the neighborhood boys , fishing in the stream with some home-made fishing tackle . 31 . MEDIUM SHOT ON BRIDGE The boy is holding his fish pole with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwary fish will soon take the hook . So intent is the boy on his fishing that he does not hear Bob Heath as the latter approaches on his bicycle . 32 . SMALL BRIDGE OVER CREEK The boy is still sitting on the bridge , fishing , when Bob Heath , coming home to the noonday meal from the college in Darienne , starts to ride noiselessly across the bridge on his bicycle . 33 . MEDIUM SHOT ON BRIDGE As Bob rides by , he takes one foot off a pedal of his bicycle and , without stopping his wheel , kicks the can of angle worms into the creek . The boy hears the splash , quickly turns , sees who his tormentor is , and realizes that all fishing is spoiled for that day . 34 . SMALL BRIDGE OVER CREEK Bob continues across the bridge on his way home . The boy gets to his feet and calls after  --  12  --  Bob , telling him what he thinks of the trick Bob has played . Subtitle 5 :  --  Bob Heath , the Spoiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON BOB On the further side of the bridge , Bob stops his bicycle and calls out to the boy , telling him to forget it  --  to keep things out of the way if he does not wish to get them kicked into the water . As Bob talks he smiles maliciously . It is no concern of his if he kicked over the can of angle worms . What does he care for fishing , anyhow ! Allow for sufficient action here to show that Bob is not only selfish and inconsiderate of others but is malicious too . 36 . CLOSE-UP ON COUNTRY BOY The boy is very angry but realizes that he can do nothing to Bob as the latter is so much bigger and stronger than he is . Tears start to come into his eyes as he looks angrily off scene at the disagreeable Bob . 37 . SMALL BRIDGE OVER CREEK Bob , well satisfied with the fact that he has spoiled the boy 's fishing and has hurt his feelings too , continues on his way home . The boy , with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge toward home , in a direction opposite to that taken by Bob .  --  13  --  Subtitle 6 :  --  Dave Heath , the oldest son , whose long days of hard work make it possible to keep the family together  --  Bruce Gordon Section Details 38 . MEDIUM SHOT OF DAVE AND PLOW HORSES Dave has brought his plow horses to a stop and stands in the partly plowed field , mopping his brow with a handkerchief . Now he wipes off the sweat band of his battered felt hat preparatory to putting it on his head again and going to the farmhouse for the noonday meal . Dave is a strong manly fellow of about twenty-five years of age . The lines in his face show that he is possessed of considerable character , and is accustomed to hard work on the farm . This work he does uncomplainingly as upon his shoulders rests almost the entire burden of making the farm pay enough to feed and clothe them all and to keep Bob in college . That he is perhaps imposed upon at times has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willing to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others . Section Details 39 . EXTERIOR HEATH FARMHOUSE Shooting from the country road that runs past the front of the house . This shot shows nearly all of the house , the picket fence and the gate which is now open . Through the gate now come some chickens , hurrying to get out of the way of Paul and Patsy . The twins are not chasing the chickens , but are fleeing from Mary who is trying to get her hands on them to wash them for the noonday meal . From the haste with which the twins  --  14  --  flee , one might think that they were hurrying to escape some dire punishment for having climbed up the windmill ; but the only punishment for them is having their faces and hands washed . Just as in the case of all small children , this is a real punishment for they see little necessity in getting washed up only to get dirty again . 40 . SIDEYARD HEATH FARMHOUSE Bob has already entered and is riding along on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falls to the ground . To add to his confusion and disgust , some geese , waddling along hurriedly to escape the twins who are still fleeing from Mary , almost walk over him in their mad haste . As Bob falls , the packages which he has been carrying under his arm are scattered in the barnyard. 41 . CLOSE-UP ON BOB  --  SIDEYARD Bob is tangled up with his bicycle and is lying almost flat on the ground . The frightened geese hurry to escape from the twins ; and even the chickens become so excited that they begin to fly over Bob , covering him with dirt . Presently Bob manages to sit up ; and , as soon as the dust has cleared , looks around him , with intense disgust written all over his face . Bob 's position is not a dignified one , and he feels this fact keenly . 42 . SIDEYARD  --  HEATH FARMHOUSE While the twins stand and look at Bob ,  --  15  --  wondering whether to continue their flight or to watch Bob , Mary comes running into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him get on his feet again . 43 . ANGLE BY BARN Dave enters with the two horses he has been using on the plow , having unhitched them to let them rest during the noon hour . One of the horses enters the barn . Dave leads the other forward by the reins toward the barn door . 44 . HEATH KITCHEN Mrs. Heath is busying herself near the stove , finishing her preparations for the noonday meal . The twins , led by Paul , enter . Paul stands talking to his mother , while Patsy goes to her and clings to her skirts . 45 . ANGLE BY BARN Near the barn door Dave stands by the side of the horse , preparatory to leading it into its stall in the barn . He is facing the horse and does not see Mary who comes running into the scene and goes to where he is standing . 46 . MEDIUM SHOT ON DAVE AND HORSE Shooting toward barn door . Dave is adjusting the horse 's harness when Mary enters scene . As she gets close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms around his neck , lifts herself off of the ground . Now she releases her hold around Dave 's neck ,  --  16  --  faces him , and starts to put her arms around his neck again . 47 . CLOSE-UP ON DAVE AND MARY Mary 's arms are around Dave 's neck . Together they stand there looking happily into each other 's eyes . Now Dave places his hands under Mary 's arms and begins to lift her , to seat her upon the horse 's back . 48 . CLOSE SHOT ON DAVE AND HORSE Dave lifts Mary up and puts her on the horse 's back ; then , taking off his hat , he stands there and looks at her with a good-natured smile . Allow sufficient footage to show that brother and sister are held together by a close bond of sympathy and understanding . 49 . CLOSE-UP ON DAVE Dave 's face is wreathed in smiles as he looks up at Mary . 50 . CLOSE SHOT ON DAVE AND HORSE As Mary holds out her arms to him , Dave reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment they stand there ; and then Mary , laughing , playfully punches Dave in the ribs and runs out of the scene . Dave smiles at her as she goes and then leads the horse into the barn . 51 . SIDEYARD  --  HEATH FARMHOUSE The disgruntled Bob leans his bicycle against the side of the house , then comes back and  --  17  --  picks up the packages which he had dropped in his fall . Bob is in a disagreeable humor on account of the accident which befell him  --  a more disagreeable humor than usual , although at no time has he been in a particularly agreeable frame of mind . 52 . SIDE PORCH  --  HEATH FARMHOUSE Tipping in bench , pump and wash basin . A towel is hanging from a nail driven into the side of the house . Dave enters , hangs his hat on a nail near towel , pumps water into the basin from a small head pump and is about to wash up for the noonday meal when the disgruntled Bob enters from the opposite side . As Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob is accustomed to pour all his trouble into Dave 's ear . 53 . CLOSE-UP ON BOB Looking thoroughly disgusted with things in general , Bob stands there and watches Dave . Subtitle 7 :  --  Selfishly accepting as his due the sacrifices his mother and Dave are making for his education . So thoroughly is Bob wrapped up in his selfishness that he can not appreciate the fact that what is being done for him is a sacrifice indeed . He really feels that he is entitled to a great deal more than he is actually getting , and that his life is a very hard one .  --  18  --  54 . SIDE PORCH  --  HEATH FARMHOUSE Dave stands watching Bob as the latter comes toward him , knowing that Bob has something about which he wishes to complain . Bob walks close to Dave , prepared to impress him with the weight of his remarks . 55 . MEDIUM SHOT ON DAVE AND BOB The disgruntled Bob stands there , petulantly complaining of his hard lot in life . Dave listens to him patiently . 56 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cute little shot of Mary as she washes Patsy 's face and then Paul 's . Like most young children , the twins do not like to have their faces washed but realize that they have to submit to the inevitable . Mary is in a good-natured mood as she is very fond of her little brother and sister . 57 . CLOSE SHOT ON DAVE AND BOB While Bob continues to talk , Dave smilingly places his hand on Bob 's shoulder as much as to say , " Well , Bob , old man , do n't take things so much to heart . " 58 . HEATH LIVING ROOM This shot shows the door leading into the kitchen , and also that leading to the side porch . The twins are already seated and Mary , on the opposite side of the table , busies herself arranging the knives and forks .  --  19  --  Mrs. Heath comes from the kitchen , carrying in her hands a plate of meat which she places on the table . Bob enters from side door , still carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Heath goes to meet him as he enters . 59 . ANGLE BY SIDE PORCH Dave has finished washing his face and hands and now throws the water out of the small tin basin he has been using . Replacing the basin , he rolls down his sleeves preparatory to entering the house . Section Details 60 . MEDIUM SHOT ON GROUP  --  HEATH LIVING ROOM Shooting toward the side door through which Bob has just entered . Mary , with her hand resting upon the back of one of the chairs at the table , looks at Bob as his mother talks to him . As Mrs. Heath continues to talk , Bob turns and looks at Mary , his face wearing a scowl . Dave is seen coming toward the side door . Mrs. Heath says : Subtitle 8 :  --  " John 's sweater is done . You can take it back to college with you , Bob . " 61 . CLOSE-UP ON MRS . HEATH AND BOB As Mrs. Heath speaks title , Bob turns and looks sharply at Mary off scene . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can take John Trevor 's sweater ; but he is positive that he will do nothing of the kind . He does not intend to become anybody 's errand boy . Bob turns , looks at his mother , and says :  --  20  --  Subtitle 9 :  --  " Aw , let Mary take Trevor 's sweater  --  she 's stuck on him , I 'm not . " ( Scene 61 continued . ) As Bob says this in a disagreeable tone , Mrs. Heath , realizing that he is selfish , though not fully understanding why , looks at him wonderingly . Then she places her hand on his shoulder affectionately and tries to coax him back into a better mood , but her effort has little effect on Bob . Subtitle 10 :  --  John Trevor  --  Lloyd Hughes . 62 . CLOSE-UP ON-JOHN  --  CLASS GAME This shot shows the athletic field of the college in Darienne . John 's shirt is torn almost to rags and his hair is disheveled , but he still holds down on the ground the college boy with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and smiles . He is having a fine time , is thoroughly in earnest , and shows that he is a clean , good-natured young fellow . 63 . MEDIUM SHOT ON CLASS GAME This shot shows a struggling mass of collegians engaged in the class game . John starts to pick up one of the boys out of the melee and to carry him off the field which has been marked out for the contest . 64 . CLASS GAME This is a long shot of the class game . The contest still goes on furiously . John has  --  21  --  picked up in his arms his particular opponent for the moment and is carrying him off the field . 65 . CLASS GAME A still longer shot of the class game . John carries his opponent outside the space marked off for the game and lays him on the ground . The referee stands near at hand ready to announce the winner of the contest . 66 . GRANDSTAND  --  COLLEGE A flash of the college girls and boys as they rise from their seats and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand to announce that John 's side has won the game . The victorious boys gather into a group and cheer at the referee 's decision . &nbsp; pp. 22-43 68 . HEATH LIVING ROOM Dave , having entered the living room , goes to the twins and kisses them fondly , then helps his mother to a chair before he himself sits down . Mary takes Bob 's hat and places it on a chair to one side ; while Bob , still looking sour , goes to the opposite side of the table and sits down . Allow sufficient footage to show sharply the contrast between Dave and Bob  --  the one of an affectionate disposition and content with even his hard lot of life ; the other , selfish in the extreme , and lacking any real affection .  --  22  --  69 . EXTERIOR HEATH FARMHOUSE Shooting from across the country road which runs in front of the Heath farmhouse . Martin Freeland enters in his classy roadster , stops the car in front of the gate , climbs out of the car , and enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and appears to be satisfied with himself . 70 . ANGLE OF HEATH LIVING ROOM This shot includes the side of the table where Mrs. Heath and the twins are seated and shows Mary , whose place is at the end of the table nearest the door and with her back towards it . Martin comes on the side porch , stops for an instant , then opens the screen door and enters . He really feels so much superior to all of them in a way that he does not consider it necessary to remove the cap he is wearing . Having said " How do you do , " Martin stands to one side of the door , with his back resting against the wall . As he enters , Mary turns and looks at him in a rather disinterested way . Although he is rich and one of her most persistent suitors , Mary does not like him  --  she merely tolerates him through force of necessity . Martin is very friendly with Dave and Mary ; on this account , she could not snub him were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose infatuation for Mary , and jealousy of John Trevor , keeps him hanging around the small town of Darienne.  --  Philo McCollough  --  23  --  71 . CLOSE-UP ON MARTIN Martin is laughing and talking . Finally he removes his cap , folds his arms with an air of self-assurance and says : Subtitle 12 :  --  " I was just driving by . Anyone going to town ? " ( Scene 71 continued . ) Martin finishes title and looks out of the corner of his eye toward Mary . His invitation is apparently a general one , but it is Mary whom he wishes to ride into town with him . 72 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY Mary , none too pleased at the prospect of riding into Darienne with Martin , looks at him for a moment and then turns her head away and looks down at the table , trying to think of some excuse to offer him . 73 . CLOSE-UP ON MARTIN A flash of Martin as he stands near the door smiling , waiting for Mary to make up her mind to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Heath has heard Martin 's invitation , but has not noted the fact that Mary does not care to accept it .

Mrs. Heath says :  --  24  --  Subtitle 13 :  --  " Mary 's going  --  she 'll be glad of the lift . " ( Scene 74 continued . ) Having spoken this title , Mrs Heath turns and exits into the kitchen . Martin comes over to the chair where Mary is seated , rests his hand familiarly on the back of the chair and awaits her decision . 75 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY Mary , still looking down at the table and thinking of some excuse to offer Martin , finally looks up , turns her head toward Martin and says : Subtitle 14 :  --  " Do n't bother about me . I 'll ride Bob 's bicycle . " ( Scene 75 continued . ) As she says this she continues to look at Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLOSE-UP ON BOB Bob is about to take a bite of bread when he hears Mary speak the above title . He looks sharply in Mary 's direction , a disagreeable scowl wrinkling his forehead . 77 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY Mary turns her head and looks toward Bob to see what effect her remark has had upon him . Although she knows Bob only too well to believe that he will let her use his bicycle , yet she is not positive that he will not consent to its use in the circumstances .  --  25  --  78 . CLOSE-UP ON BOB The selfish Bob is disgusted to think that Mary could have even thought of such a thing . If she goes , it will have to be with Martin . Bob says in no uncertain tones : Subtitle 15 :  --  " You WILL not ! Do you think I 'm going to walk back ? " ( Scene 78 continued . ) As he says this Bob 's face is clouded with displeasure . He does not understand how Mary could be so selfish in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk anywhere is repellent . 79 . CLOSE-UP ON MARTIN Martin still stands there smiling facetiously . He is very glad that Bob has adopted such an attitude . Mary will either have to walk or go with him in the roadster if she wants to go at all . 80 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY Mary stares at Bob for a moment  --  it is beyond her comprehension why Bob is so consistently selfish and disagreeable . Then she turns and looks at Martin in a helpless sort of way . Although she does not want to go with him , she sees nothing else to do . 81 . ANGLE OF HEATH LIVING ROOM Mrs. Heath enters to Mary and tells her to go take off her apron and put on her hat . Martin , seeing that he has an unwitting ally in Mrs. Heath , takes hold of Mary 's  --  26  --  chair to draw it away from the table as she gets up . 82 . CLOSE SHOT ON MARY AND MARTIN  --  HEATH LIVING ROOM Martin leans down and urges Mary to hurry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair . 83 . ANGLE OF HEATH LIVING ROOM Mary exits from scene to go to her room . Dave , having finished his meal , gets up from the table and starts toward Martin . 84 . MARY 'S ROOM This shot shows the doorway , a dresser , and a table on which is a lamp of the Rochester burner type . Mary enters through doorway , stands near dresser , and begins changing her dress . 85 . MEDIUM SHOT ON DAVE AND MARTIN  --  HEATH LIVING ROOM Dave now stands talking to Martin . The latter says to him : Subtitle 16 :  --  " I 'm driving to New York tomorrow  --  want to go ? " ( Scene 85 continued . ) Martin 's invitation is a genuine one . He is very fond of the hard working Dave . Dave smiles at Martin and says : Subtitle 17 :  --  " I 'd be glad of the chance . I 've got to go sometime this month . "  --  27  --  86 . ANGLE OF HEATH LIVING-ROOM As Dave finishes the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dave 's decision to accompany him . 87 .

ANGLE OF HEATH LIVING-ROOM Dave goes to the twins , wipes off their faces with a napkin and starts to feed Patsy . Mary enters , kisses her mother good-bye , and exits with Martin through the door leading to the side porch . As they go , Dave waves his hand to Martin , assuring him that he will be on hand to go to New York on the morrow . Bob , not having finished lunch , is still sitting at the table . He does not indicate the slightest interest in anything that is taking place , being too self-centered and selfish to devote any real thought to the affairs of others  --  unless in the way of complaint . 89 . EXTERIOR HEATH FARMHOUSE Shooting across the roadway as in the previous scene . Martin and Mary come from house , climb into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDIUM SHOT ON DAVE AND BOB Dave has moved a chair close up to Bob 's and now sits there talking to him . Bob is scowling ; but Dave is looking at him good-naturedly ,  --  28  --  waiting to hear what he has to say . Although Bob is not actually interested in Mary 's affairs , yet he feels that they form a good basis for a protest . As he is in a mood to find fault with anything , he might as well choose this subject as any other . Bob says gravely as if he were announcing something of vital importance : Subtitle 18 :  --  " Do you know that Mary sees John every time she goes to the college ? " ( Scene 90 continued . ) Dave turns his heap and looks off scene , smiling . To him Bob 's question sounds very funny . Bob is merely trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill . Dave knows that Bob has been in a very disgruntled mood ever since he fell off his bicycle , and is seizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Dave 's usual method in handling Bob when he gets off on a streak of this kind is to laugh at him , but in a good-natured way . The now laughing Dave turns and looks at Bob , then he says genially : Subtitle 19 :  --  " What of it ? John sees Mary every time he comes out here . " ( Scene 90 continued . ) Bob can find no ready answer to Dave 's counter question but is satisfied that he is in the right , as usual . The conditions seem to him to be entirely different , but Dave refuses to believe that they are so essentially different , as to warrant a protest on the part of anyone . Bob is not wholly satisfied that Dave can not see things in the  --  29  --  same light as he does and continues to argue the matter with Dave , who does not believe there is anything to argue about . 91 .

John Trevor comes running into scene , goes through the gateway and looks off scene where he sees  --  93 . MEDIUM SHOT ON MARTIN 'S ROADSTER Mary has just descended from the car . She thanks Martin for bringing her to town and then exits from scene , carrying a knitted handbag in which is the sweater intended for John . Martin very formally touches his hand to his cap as Mary leaves , but is none too pleased with the thought that she is leaving him and going to see John Trevor . As the two young men are rivals for Mary 's hand and apparently she thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only  --  30  --  does not like John but is intensely jealous of him . 94 . GATEWAY TO COLLEGE GROUNDS John , standing near gateway , sees Mary coming and hastens to climb on the ledge of the wall so that he can see her as she approaches , and surprise her as she comes through the gateway . 95 .

WALL OF COLLEGE GROUNDS This shot shows an archway , in front of which is a tree with a twisted trunk . John and Mary enter scene through archway and come to the tree in the foreground . Both are a trifle ill at ease ; but they are thoroughly in love with each other , and this fact renders them unnecessarily conscious of each other 's presence . 101 . CLOSE SHOT ON JOHN AND MARY John has his arm resting against one of the trees ; Mary is standing near the other . John is in a very happy frame of mind and looks devotedly at Mary as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother has come back from Europe . She arrived in New York today . . . . " 102 .

CLOSE-UP ON JOHN John , wondering how Mary will receive the rest of the information he has to impart , looks at her questioningly as he says : Subtitle 21 :  --  " . . . and tomorrow I 'm going home . " ( Scene 104 continued . ) As he says this , John plainly shows the enthusiasm with which the idea has imbued him . He is thinking solely of the fact that he is to see his mother again after a long absence . This fact for the time being has made him forget that his going home will deprive him of his pleasure in seeing Mary so often . 105 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY Mary is smiling as John says the above title but soon its full import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the expression of happiness , that was on her face but a moment ago , changes to one of sadness . Now she realizes that after today it may be a long time before she will see John again . 106 . CLOSE-UP ON JOHN John looks at Mary , sorry because a look of sadness has come into her face , yet secretly pleased that she loves him so dearly that she is sad when he is about to go away and leave her , if only for a little while . 107 . MEDIUM SHOT ON JOHN AND MARY Mary vainly tries to conceal her emotion . Her lips quiver and she struggles to keep back  --  33  --  the tears . Then , lest John see how sad she feels at the thought of losing him , she turns and exits from the scene . With sober eyes , John watches her go , wondering just what he should do in the circumstances . 108 . CLOSE-UP ON JOHN With sober face John watches Mary go and then bursts into a low laugh . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must not take this coming separation so much to heart . On this last day together , Mary must cheer up and rejoice in the happiness which is to come to him on the morrow . 109 . WALL ON VERANDA  --  COLLEGE GROUNDS This wall is a low one at the end of a veranda of one of the college buildings . Upon the end of the wall there is a large concrete base , placed there for ornamental purposes . Mary comes to the wall and stands there with bowed head . Her heart is heavy at the thought of losing John , if only for a little while . John quickly comes to her side and tells her not to feel sorry as he will surely return soon to see her again . Placing his hands under Mary 's arms , he lifts her up and seats her upon the wall . She places the sweater to one side and looks at him attentively , as he takes from one of his pockets a letter he has that day received from his mother . Taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary to read .  --  34  --  110 . CLOSE-UP ON MARY Mary reads the letter and shows that she is glad of the happiness that is to be John 's .

CLOSE SHOT ON JOHN AND MARY Mary has finished reading the letter and looks up at John ; the light of devotion shining in her eyes . The reading of the letter has made a great impression upon her , and she feels more proud than ever of the handsome boy standing beside her . Surely , with such a lovely mother , a son must be more than worthy of the love of any girl whom he sees fit to choose as his partner in life . Looking devotedly at John , Mary says : Subtitle 22 :  --  " Your mother must be lovely . " ( Scene 111 continued . ) As she says this , she returns the letter to John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON JOHN John looks up from the letter and vainly tries to find words to tell Mary how wonderful his mother is .

Finally he looks earnestly at Mary and says : Subtitle 24 :  --  " When he sees how wonderful she is , I know he 'll let you visit us . . . . " 113 . CLOSE-UP ON JOHN AND MARY As he says the above title , he pauses as if not knowing what else to say ; but Mary can read in his face just what he wishes to express to her , and can not just now for lack of words . Demurely she turns her head aside as John comes closer to her , and then says to her earnestly : Subtitle 25 :  --  " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Scene 113 continued . ) Mary turns her head and smiles delightedly at John , telling him that there is nothing else on earth that would give her greater pleasure than going to visit him and his mother . 114 .

CLOSE-UP ON HELENE Helene continues to read the letter ; then , as she glances up , her face softens with emotion as she thinks of the fine , manly boy with whom she parted three years before . As she again begins to read the letter , her face lights up with happiness at the thought that tomorrow will see their reunion . If only conditions in her life were different , she could feel far happier . As she thinks of these conditions , her face grows wistful and a pathetic look comes into her eyes .

The gambling den is a great money-maker , and can well afford to cater to its patrons . Food and drink cost but little in comparison with the vast amount of money that is taken in nightly . 119 .

As the games are in progress and he wishes to be in the main room while they are going on , he is slightly annoyed at the fact that Helene has called him up . He asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , when she states that it is , he agrees to come over at once . 124 . CLOSE SHOT ON HELENE  --  TELEPHONE CABINET Helene hears Keenan agree to come over at once .

He is not in a good humor at having been called away from the gambling den and is inclined to be pugnacious  --  more so than usual . Helene notes Keenan 's ill-humor but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . Finally she says : Subtitle 32 :  --  " I loathe this gambling business  --  I want to sell out ! " ( Scene 131 continued . ) As she says this , Keenan looks at her in sharp surprise and adopts a belligerent attitude toward her . Her proposition is a new one and he does not understand the motive behind it . Pointing to himself , he says in a sarcastic tone : Subtitle 33 :  --  " How about me  --  how about paying back the rest of the money your husband borrowed to start the business ? " ( Scene 131 continued . ) He does not care particularly about keeping her in the gambling business against her will , but wants to be assured that he will get every dollar coming to him . As he speaks the above title , Helene slowly turns her head away and says :  --  41  --  Subtitle 34 :  --  " I have sent for my boy , I wanted him  --  it 's been three years  --  now I 'm afraid he 'll find out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helene says this , her face twitches with her intense emotion  --  the business to her has become a nightmare ; and now she is in mortal terror lest John discover the source of her income and cast her out of his life forever . She realizes only too well how low in his estimation she would sink should he discover that he has been living off the misery of others . Almost brought to the point of tears by her emotion , she slowly exits from the scene , leaving Keenan gazing after her intently , undecided just what to do . 132 . MEDIUM SHOT ON DOORWAY  --  HELENE 'S APARTMENT Helene goes to doorway and stands there , her head bowed down , wondering if Keenan will agree to the rupture of their business relations or whether he will insist upon her going on as in the past .

CLOSE-UP ON KEENAN Keenan speaks the above title in a tone of bitterness and sarcasm , watching Helene closely to see what effect it will have upon her . He can not understand her attitude at all  --  to him the whole idea is merely the whim of a woman . 136 . CLOSE-UP ON HELENE As Helene hears Keenan 's cutting remark , her face grows sad to think that circumstances ever forced her into becoming Keenan 's partner in the nefarious business . She says wistfully : Subtitle 36 :  --  " Sometimes I think John would rather have had me  --  than the money . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though some doubt existed in her mind yet , deep within her heart , she knows that John would far rather have never had a dollar than to have had an abundance derived from a gambling hell . The thought of this makes her hang her head in shame . 137 . CLOSE-UP ON KEENAN For a moment , Keenan looks thoughtful as if weighing things in the balance . Perhaps  --  43  --  after all it will be just as well if Helene does sell her interest in the gambling establishment to one of his choosing , since she seems determined to sell out anyhow . Finally he says to her : Subtitle 37 :  --  " What you say goes  --  but it 'll take a couple of weeks to straighten things out . " 138 .

EXTERIOR HEATH FARM In this scene a partly plowed field shows in the foreground , the creek in background . Underneath the wide-spreading branches of the trees which line the creek , the cows are grazing peacefully , unconcerned with the affairs of mortals . Two horses enter attached to a plow which the struggling Bob is vainly trying to guide . To Bob , unaccustomed as he is to any form of manual labor , the task of plowing is a very arduous one . Dave 's death has forced him to do all the work that must be done on the farm , if the family is to live ; and Bob 's dreams of a college education  --  84  --  have been rudely shattered . He utterly detests the very thought of having to do this work , but now there is no help for it . 309 . MEDIUM SHOT ON BOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense disgust written large upon his face . Brutally he jerks the reins of the horses as he calls out to them . None of his troubles in trying to plow a field does he blame upon himself ; but considers that the horses are wholly at fault and vents his spite on them , knowing that they can offer no protest in return for any brutal treatment he may accord them . 310 . EXTERIOR HEATH FARM Bob still struggles angrily with the plow . It seems invested with almost human perversity as it jumps out of the furrow . Subtitle 78 :  --  After weeks of wandering  --  drawn back to Darienne by anxiety for the family and his love for Mary . 311 . INTERIOR CABIN This cabin is a small one used by the college boys as a hunting lodge and is situated close to the Heath farm on a hillside over-looking it . The place is crudely furnished ; but it is equipped with sufficient furniture and cooking utensils so that one can be comfortable , if he is prepared to rough it . To one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel above it . John , accompanied by one of the  --  85  --  neighboring farmers , who has driven him over to the lodge from the railroad station , is discovered on scene . The farmer is carrying John 's grip , his sole article of baggage . John , now dressed in a flannel shirt and a suit of clothes such as a young man with little money might wear , is looking around and inspecting the cabin . Finally , as John seems well pleased with the place , the farmer places the grip on a chair beside a small wooden table . 312 . CLOSE SHOT ON JOHN AND FARMER  --  CABIN They are standing at the end of the small table . John asks the farmer if he thinks it would be all right for him to occupy the cabin for a while . The farmer is a very genial old fellow and says : Subtitle 79 :  --  " Sure you can have it ; them college boys only use it for a hunting lodge . " ( Scene 312 continued . ) The farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to take possession of the cabin and make himself at home , exits . John watches him go and then stands there wondering if the Heaths , ignorant of the place where Dave met his death , will welcome him to their home as before or whether they have learned that Dave was killed in Helene 's gambling den and will close their doors against him forever . 313 . MEDIUM SHOT ON MARY AND MRS . HEATH Mary and her mother are standing at the gate in the picket fence which surrounds the  --  86  --  Heath farmhouse .

" ( Scene 317 continued . ) As she says this her lips quiver ever so little . She feels hurt to think that after his long period of devotion he may desert them all now , in their hour of  --  87  --  greatest need . To her it is strange indeed that one could show such solicitude when her brother died and then disappear from sight altogether ; but deep down in her heart , she knows that someday he will come back to her . 318 .

CLOSE-UP ON FARMER The farmer , having had his say , starts to drive away but suddenly realizes that he can spoil Martin 's day for him by telling him of John 's return . He has never liked the rich Martin , anyhow . The farmer says : Subtitle 84 :  --  " You wo n't be seein ' so much of Mary , now John Trevor 's back ! " ( Scene 341 continued . ) As he says this he watches Martin intently to see what the effect of the remark will be , for he is well aware of Martin 's jealousy of John . 342 . CLOSE-UP ON MARTIN Martin hears the farmer 's remark and shows that the news is not pleasing to him . During John 's absence , he has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with opposition in his suit for Mary 's hand . 343 .

He will break up John 's romance immediately by going to the Heaths and telling them where Dave was killed . 345 . MARY 'S ROOM Shooting through the open door of Mary 's room toward living-room where Mrs. Heath and Mary are now standing . Mary enters room , closes door , and stands with her back to it . 346 .

Bob enters with the two plow horses to give them a drink before putting them in their stalls for the noon hour . He gradually gets the horses maneuvered around in front of the trough but has a difficult time managing them , and is in a very disagreeable mood . The horses could be easily managed by anyone experienced in that line ; but they  --  93  --  seem to sense Bob 's inexperience , although they are in no sense fractious . 349 .

Then he reaches down , grasps his injured foot , and starts to strike the horse again . 353 . CLOSE SHOT ON MARTIN Martin , standing beside the roadster , has been quietly observing all that has taken place at the watering trough . He notes that Bob is very angry with the horse and is in a disagreeable mood toward things in general , and considers this the propitious moment to tell him just what he knows of John Trevor and the gambling den where Dave was killed . Bob will make a useful ally in forever blasting  --  94  --  John 's romance with Mary . With this idea in mind , Martin starts toward watering trough . 354 . CLOSE-UP ON MRS .

" ( Scene 358 continued . ) As this title appears there DISSOLVES INTO it a spinning roulette wheel and a roulette layout . 359 . CLOSE-UP ON BOB AND MARTIN Bob is listening attentively but makes no attempt to answer Martin 's question . It had never occurred to him to question the source of John 's money . Martin continues , maliciously : Subtitle 88 :  --  " From his mother 's gambling house  --  she owned the biggest one in the city ! " ( Scene 359 continued . ) As this title appears , there DISSOLVES INTO it a spinning roulette wheel and a roulette layout as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96  --  but is not the type of character who worries about where money comes from , so long as it comes . Moreover , he is inclined to doubt Martin 's statement . Martin , now watching Bob intently , says : Subtitle 89 :  --  " It 's the truth ! She owned the one where  --  Dave was killed ! " ( Scene 359 continued . ) The effect of this statement is electrical . Bob excitedly leaps to his feet . Martin , adding fuel to the flames , says : Subtitle 90 :  --  " That 's why he paid all the funeral bills and helped you  --  because he was to blame ! " ( Scene 359 continued . ) Bob is almost trembling with rage as he hears this . Martin , having now so successfully stirred up Bob 's wrath against John , continues : Subtitle 91 :  --  " But you have to work while he takes it easy  --  and makes love to Mary !

Martin , thoroughly satisfied with what he has so far accomplished , and with an amused expression on his face to think that his plan has worked out so well , watches Bob go . Section Details 361 .

" ( Scene 411 continued . ) These two things are uppermost in the mind of the selfish Bob . To  --  107  --  him it seems far more important that he should get an education , and not be compelled to work , than that the grain should be harvested and the children fed . 412 .

" ( Scene 418 continued . ) As her mother says this , Mary can not keep back the tears that glisten in her eyes .
