ELIJAH COBB ( 1768-1848 ) : A CAPE COD SKIPPER-With a foreword by Ralph D. Paine-Yale University Press ( $1.50 ) . <P> The purposes of historical study are often more faithfully served by a vivid incident than by pages of abstractions : this little memoir illumines America 's maritime era . The poverty-stricken mother of Elijah Cobb , a sailor 's widow , mothering six , sent him out into the world . At 14 he sailed for Surinam as cook and cabin-boy ; he was in command of a brig at 23 . The captain of those days was navigator , merchant , banker and diplomatist as occasion required ; witness his first voyage to Europe as shipmaster . The year was 1793 , when neutrals had few rights . His brig captured by the French on a pretext , her cargo of foodstuffs looted for starving Brest , the guillotine overshadowing all , Cobb loyally strove to secure his owner 's just dues . Revolutionary officialdom caressed its neck with premonitory tenderness and did nothing but lose his papers . He forced his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remained in Paris about three weeks after my bills were sent to Brest , and during that time the great man who had so assentially befreinded me was beheaded by the Galliotine . " Thus Cobb , laconically . <P> For nearly 40 years he followed his hazardous calling , North Sea or Gulf of Guinea all one to him in the line of trade . Profoundly pious he peddled Medford rum or flour with the equally clear conscience of the times . Regretfully we leave him at 80 , a ruddy-cheeked old man , on a little farm of his own ; " the wind has got around to the south , " as he returns from a visit to the young orchard .
