Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. - young publisher , editor and scion , who was so hopeful ( TIME , May 10 ) that the crisis would be tided over - the crisis brought upon his many little newspapers by the fact that his father , General Vanderbilt , was tired of losing money in them - found his ships miscarried , his creditors grown cruel , his estate very low . First a potential purchaser of the Illustrated Daily Herald of San Francisco failed to come to terms with him and the paper suspended publication . The Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News , the first paper he started and his best , went into receivership ; the San Francisco paper shrank from 22 to 8 smudgy pages , and then suspended . General Vanderbilt made no statement . <P> Cornelius Jr . announced , however , that his creditors were extending him time , and that two " large financial houses " in Manhattan had voluntarily laid plans before him for financing the papers . He also made public a telegram from Mayor Rolph of San Francisco : " I hope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust themselves and that once more we can have the Herald as a part of our daily lives . No one knows better than I how hard and how unceasingly you have worked , and I can not but feel that ultimate success will crown your efforts . " <P> Mr. Vanderbilt was down , not out .
