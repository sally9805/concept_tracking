Following a map drawn by the late Admiral George Dewey , the S. S. Maryland fetched up and hove to off Cape San Lucas , lower California . Two launches were lowered for a late-afternoon fishing expedition . Captain Victor A. Kimberley , the Maryland 's commander , put off in a third boat to act as a patrol against unimaginable dangers from the desolate Mexican shore . In his hands rested the safety of his country 's President-elect . <P> Tall though the tales of Fisherman Zane Grey et al . may be , and excellent though the map of Admiral Dewey , the waters off Cape San Lucas were not full of huge , hungry denizens that evening . Mr. Hoover trolled first with a spinner , then with a silver minnow , and watched the launch 's wake for the mighty splash of marlin , yellowtail or amberjack . But the splashes that came were comparatively small-a 15-pound dolphin , a 5-pound Spanish mackerel . A third fish , the " biggest one , " got away . Beside Mr. Hoover in his launch stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch-Republican New York Herald Tribune . Just as Mr. Hoover 's " biggest one " struck , Pundit Sullivan hooked a small but active dolphin . Unaware of any call for etiquette , the Sullivan dolphin rushed across the Hoover line , fouled it , dragged the new Hoover reel off the new Hoover rod . As Pundit Sullivan landed his dolphin , the sun sank . The President-elect went home for supper . Allan Hoover , out fishing with Secretary George Akerson , caught nothing and thereby caused his mother to lose a bet . <P> In a Navy chief yeoman 's cap , the chief yeoman of U. S. foreign trade and diplomacy whiled away the cruising days with constitutionals around the deck , reading detective stories , reclining on a cabin lounge to chat with the 20 newsmen aboard , observing naval mysteries such as range-finding and fire-control in the gun turrets , and in dictating memoranda to several stenographers . Mrs. Hoover sat on deck , knitting* . <P> Evenings , there was open-air cinema . Cecil B. De Mille had flown up from Hollywood before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's proudest new productions . The offer was accepted and the Maryland 's tars came in , with the Hoovers , for special viewings of Clara Bow , Emil Jannings , Marion Davies , Janet Gaynor , et al . The film titles ranged from Three Week Ends ( Paramount ) to Felix in Jungle Bungle ( Educational ) . <P> The Maryland 's company took up deck golf , shuffleboard , trapshooting . Except for the President-elect 's customary tall stiff collar , every one changed entirely to tropical clothes . Will Irwin , writing for the New York World , reported : " The atmosphere is courteous and pleasant , without formality , and everything is ' as easy as an old shoe . ' " The Maryland 's radio operators were busied , sending tens of thousands of idyllic press reports and receiving Associated Press flashes for publication in The Evening Hurricane , ship 's daily . <P> Interpreter Sherwell from the State Department started classes in Spanish in the wardroom.                  @ @ @
