txt M. Briand has accepted the British Premier 's invitation to go to London to discuss the general situation with regard to Germany and is now busy trying to arrange to make . he trip about the 20th of this month . his morning he had a long interview with M. Loucheur during which the . dinister of Reconstruction informed him ' ally of the line that his conversation in England had taken and the two Ministers then went to see the President to try to arrange-that- debates in which M. Briand must take part next week should be advanced as far as possible so that he may be free by the end of next week . M. Loucheur also paid a visit to the Elysee , where he gave President Milt/rand a full account of the British intentions and attitude as he had learned them . In le press there has been one of those somersaults in the attitude toward England which always mark the end of a period of suspicion , by the suggestion of a frank talk . M. Loucheur , too , has helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement that neither a loan nor a moratorium will be granted by England to Germany without the approval of France . This was no more than any one with any knowledge or authority knew , but it appears to have come as a welcome relief to those who had wrought themselves up into a passion at the mere suggestion of its possibility . British to Present New Plans . M. Loucheur has also brought back another impression . He believes that when the two Premiers meet , Lloyd George and his Government will be Prepared to Wer proposals which will not only he fair , but generous , to France , and will inaugurate a new and much more cordial relationship between the two cmintries. thes1 proposals will be is not even hinted by the Minister . All hc will say is that lh3 convt  --  rsation of tht. two Premiers will cover the whole financial and economic situation of : ? ' ra nee and England with regard to G  --  irriany. and that out of the discussion a common policy agreeable to both countries it is hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that proposals which the British may make will be of two-fold character , designed , first , to meet the economic situation , which is England 's main difficulty , and , second , to meet the financial situation frcim which France is the sufferer . But for France the whole question is how far the British are prepared to go in , helping the . financial recovery of their ally . Only when that is known will they consent to any plan which is for the economic recovery of Englane . In the more reactionary and nationalist papers fear already is beginning to be expressed that this general conversation suggested by Mr. Lloyd George may be the beginning of some such cleaning of the slate as the Allies of that time accorded to France at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle three years after Waterloo . Germany , they declare , has not merited such action , and that there will be bitter and loud protests against Its proposal is already evident . But the real matter is how France is to reconstruct her finances and her devastated regions , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) flier present burden of unemployment . Neither of these problems , it is admitted , can be solved by squeezing the German lemon dry , and that party which used to find a solution for all problems arising out of the peace treaty in the cry , " Occupy the Ruhr ! " is steadily losing groin , : in the country . The Chamber , daily occupied Just now with the budget and daily having to face the necessity of reducing expenditure in every department of national life , has become acutely conscious of the weakness of France 's financial position , which there is no possibility of remedying out of Germany 's payments . *According to all rule and indication , even If Germany makes the payments for January and February France will get little or no cash , and after that it is the conviction of Sir John Bradbury and others that Germany will never pay again it she is not granted a respite in which to reorganize her strength . The French Deputies are therefore gradually being led along a line which it is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are discovering their own weakness , and in the discussion of the general situation it may be of infinite service that this knowledge should be admitted . When M. Briand does go to London it is almost certain M. Loucheur will accompany him .
