No British journalist would have dared to say last week , on the 33rd birthday of Edward of Wales that he still looks like a callow Eton schoolboy . None would have added the idea that Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill is as pink and paunchy as Henry VIII . Finally , few would have been so hardy as to gaze upon the strong , burly figure of Secretary of State for India the Earl of Birkenhead and then remark that if he would only carry an ax instead of a Malacca cane he would make a capital headsman . <P> These opinions were not spoken in London last week , but they were expressed unmistakably at a ball given on Edward of Wales ' birthday night by the Duchess of Sutherland . Out of a baby-carriage , wheeled upon the ballroom floor , jumped a woman clad as an infant . She squalled , pretended to be teething , she was the Duchess of Westminster , wife of Britain 's reputedly richest landed peer . <P> The fat King Henry VIII who strolled about , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor Churchill . The scowling headsman , shouldering a " bloody " ax was the Earl of Birkenhead . Of the two simpering " little boys " in Eton jackets , turned down collars , pink bow ties and white socks , one was Prince George , 24 , the other Edward of Wales .
