Breath This is the long , long song that is never sung , What every lover of life has known as wine ; This that is speech forever on the tongue , Forever missing shape of word , too fine A passion to be tempered by a sound This that is honey of sun and the rain taste of the ground . Little has ever been known of this or said , Little need ever be said and little known ; This that falls away from the lips a thread , Impalpable and glittering , is blown And lost upon the elements like light This that is water of dawn and the sweet black ice of night . Over the head Time poises like a wave , Shielding an hour within its curving length , ' An hour that has no thing to offer save A curious pipe of madness and a strength ? This rhythm mixing lightly with the blood , This tonic of dusk and , leaves and drink of the moon 's tart flood .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
