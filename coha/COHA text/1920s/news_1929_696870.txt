He informed the court that the reporters , in violation of the ' trial procedure , had tried to talk to him . Judge Nott sent to the court room for Assistant District Attorney George N. Brothers and for James D. C. Murray , attorney for . The juror , the judge and the attorneys conferred for a half hour , then Judge Nott went to the court room , saying that he would make an announcement about the incident from the bench .

The court has conferred with Mr. Smith and with counsel for both sides . Mr. Smith was made to appear as unable to be in his place here yesterday , because he had visited places in Greenwich Village the night before . The fact is that Mr. Smith was here and in his place . Court Warns Reporters . " Counsel for both sides has heard Mr. Smith 's version of *What occurred , and I believe I state it correctly that they both feel that nothing has occurred that impairs this ' , maa'a fitness as a juror . Mr. Smith has been annoyed by representatives of the press : I believe that other members of the jury have been annoyed and followed in a similar manner . " Now I have no intention to restrict the legitimate activities of the press . I have no jurisdiction as to what occurs on the street , but I have jurisdiction as to what goes on here . I am announcing now that if any juror reports to me a similar incident on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative will he revoked and the representatives of that paper will be excluded . " Mr. Brothers and Mr. Murray endorsed Smith , the defense attorney adding that " there has been no conduct on the part of this juror that would in any way unfit him to sit en this case . " Picking of : furor Begun . The task of finding a successor to Mr .. Riker , who was excused because of excessive nervousness , then began . In accordance with an order signed on Monday by Judge Nott , the remainder of the special panel of 150 talesmen , called originally in the trial , had reported . Ninety-one talesmen were examined last week before the jury box was filled . The first talesman called to the stand to be examined by Mr. Brothers and the prosecutor was Harold A. Smith of 244 West Seventy-fourth Street . Mr. Smith , who is in the food products business , said that he had followed the Rothstein case very closely in the newspapers . Mr. Murray challenged peremptorily , without having examined the venireman . Harry A. Harmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same cause , and Henry A. Polhemus of 103 East Eightysixth Street , an architect , was called to the stand . He disclosed he had been a strong supporter of Frederic R. Coudert Jr. , Republican candidate for District Attorney in the recent campaign . The State challenged because of his political work . The next talesman , Harry A. Moss of 310 West Ninety-third Street , a salesman of silks , was let off because he had formed a decided opinion in the case . Two other talesman were excused because they no longer reside in this county . They were Livingston Fountain of Bay Shore , L. I. , and William H. Newell of White Plains , N. Y. Was Friend of Rothstein . Joshua Herzog of 331 West Eightyfourth Street said he had been a friend of Rothstein for twenty-five years . He was challenged for cause . Paul Sheppard of 116 West Seventysecond Street said business reasons might prevent him from giving the trial the attention it demanded , and the defense therefore challenged him . When Mencius H. Putnam of 20 Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a deep-seated prejudice against gamblers and gambling . " The charge here is murder , not gambling . " said Judge Nott , but the venireman was excused when he insisted that he might be biased against the defendant . Shotwell was the tenth talesman examined . He was accepted although he- had said he once had a business contact with Rothstein . The contact , it developed , had been over the sale of a car to a friend of the slain gambler . Jury Resvvorn , Testimony Read . The entire jury was resworn , and the judge informed the jurymen that instead of recalling the seven witnesses who had testified up to Friday 's adjournment the testimony would be read .

The testimony of Dr. Charles Norris , medical examiner ; that of James Meehan , and the opening address of Mr. Brothers were read . Mr. finished the direct testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the historic high stud game which the State contends gave a motive to kill Roth-1 stein . Judge Nott in dismissing the jurors for the night emphasized that they should " exercise due precaution and discretion where you go . " This , interpreted as a. reference to Smith 's visit to the speakeasy , was repeated twice by the judge . He referred to the fact that the practice in the Court of General Sessions has been to permit murder trial juries , drawn from a special or " blue ribbon " panel of talesmen , to go to their homes at the end of each day 's session rather than lock them up . He recalled that in one of the trials of Harry K. Thaw for killing Stanford White the jurors had been locked up , as they had been in the Becher case . Judge Nott said that in his many years on the General Sessions bench he could recall only one of two other instances where the jury had been deprived of their liberty . The judge said that one of his reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been to shield the jurymen from outside influences . He said that he did not wish , in view of the election , to have the jurors listening to political speeches in which the Rothstein case would be discussed .
