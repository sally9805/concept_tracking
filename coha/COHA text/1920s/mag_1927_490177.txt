NO victory was ever more hollow than the success of the new Holland tunnel . You approach it with eagerness , you drive through it with speed and eclat , you emerge at the other end with joy and thanksgiving . And then where are you ? In Jersey ! THIS is the time of the year when 1 we realize most acutely that we are not getting our exercise . Among our many accomplishments is the ahillit ) to play tennis , squash , and handball , to swim and row , but we have come rarely to do any of these things because it is too much trouble . Last spring , we recall , it was the same way about tennis  --  the only courts are at incredible distances . We realized that unless a person is highly organized for athletic endeavor and , the traffic being what it is , has oceans of time , he gets nowhere . The thing got on our mind and at the time we made a survey of the Island which led us to believe that the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square miles of them , high , sunny , and healthy . We seriously suggest that some financial syndicate buy up all the roof rights it can get hold of ( including the pigeons ) and construct courts to the number of ten thousand . It would he profitable . Further , we commend to the mind of some imaginative and resourceful real-estate operator the idea of a twentry-story building to be devoted entirely to athletics  --  gymnasia , pools , courts , rinks , alleys , and everything else . Or two such buildings , one downtown and one midtown . The clubs provide not one hundredth of the facilities necessary . Such confidence have we in the foresight and sagacity of the gentlemen who build buildings in this city , we have no doubt that , with their attention thus attracted to an obvious opportunity , such a structure will be completed before next winter . All we shall expect in return for the idea is honorary life membership . BUSYBODIES have been out after 1-1 the scalps of the ticket speculators recently and the disconcerting result is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clubs . The whole situation is disturbed . Prices are up and , we hear , bootleggers are taking up the traffic that the club attendants once handled efficiently . They-are carrying seats for the shows as a sideline . The local federal officials are at the root of the trouble . Of recent years they have rarely realized that the citizens have some rights and that it is always disastrous to tamper with old established customs . The solution , in so far as we can see it , is to abolish the local United States Attorney 's office , an expedient in accord with our old supicion that New York would do better to sever relations with the rest of the country . COMING up Fifth Avenue on the G we were disturbed to see an elderly out-of-town couple in front of us grow ecstatic at the sight of the Flatiron Building . " See ! " they exclaimed to their poor , innocent children , " there it is , looking just like its pictures . " Knowing that connoisseurs universally agree that the Flatiron Building ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could not contain ourselves . " Please ! " we said , " if you must lead your children astray , do it in the home and not on Fifth Avenue . " THE editor of Harper 's accompanied Mr. H. M. Tomlinson , the soldier-writer , to England , we notice . Welt , this happens to be an age when an editor does n't dare let an author out of his sight . The very periodicity of his periodical haunts him , and he becomes a silent watcher at literary waterholes , ready to urge and encourage the first trickle . Yet the blame for the over-production of literature and near-literature goes beyond the editorial desk and falls plump upon the head of button manufacturers and other indirect patrons of the arts . The situation seems to be that advertising copywriters can turn out ads faster NOVEMDER 2 ( .9 19 27 than literary geniuses can produce the reading mat-ter that tradition has placed in the next column . It is a triumph of the paid adjective over the spontaneous verb . To meet the situa-tion we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breathing spell , and a chance to change the ribbon on their typewriters . The President Again THE latest story about Mr. Cool- idge  --  and our present favorite  --  concerns a visit he made to the estate of the Du Pont family in Delaware . During the afternoon he spent an hour in the great greenhouses , rich in a thousand varieties of exotic growths . He walked in silence through aisles of rare orchids , strange fniits and colorful blooms , as the chief gardener pointed out fragile and flaring wonders . It was not until near the end of the tour that the party reached a room where grew certain familiar fruit-bearing tropical plants . The President stopped short , looked upon them with evident interest , and spoke for the first and only time that afternoon . " Bananas , " he said . Make-Believe UR shining discovery among toys kaf is a real milking cow . It gives milk . You simply take it aside quietly , prime it , and it quickly assumes a barnyard propensity for contentment and productivity . The major theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , aviation . We had no more than stepped inside a toy shop with our nephew than he made for an exact model of the plane " which Charles A. Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic Ocean , " We both immediately decided that we would rather try to build it than grow up to he policemen . There were models of Byrd 's tri-motored Fokker , there were kites in the shape of airplanes , tricycles with wings , planes that taxied along the floor and looped the loop , and rope swings that simulated flying . Any youngster who stays on the ground after this Christmas is merely the victim of circumstances . It seems to us that , more than ever before , toys are artistic , elaborate , and glamorous . Noah 's animals really look like animals . The drawbridges of medieval castles are rich in chivalrous intent . Doll houses , which three men spent six weeks in making and which run into the hundreds of dollars , are built along the true lines of English country houses , instead of the fiercely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thrilling beyond description  --  electrically lighted , equipped with plumbing , and furnished with little hand-made rugs , painted screens , rush-bottom chairs , and twin beds in the best modern manner . The bathrooms are realistic to the point of embarrassment ; and out in the backyard , behind the garage , you find the cook talking to the iceman . " Kids read the papers , and toys have to keep up to current events , " the salesman explained to us . TM soldiers , out of fashion during the years immediately following the war , have marched bravely back into the shops , we noticed , and troops of all nationalities , marvellously wrought and delicately painted , are ambushed in cardboard boxes  --  Colonials , Red Coats , doughboys , Arabs on camels , Indians , terrible and appealing . They are of German make , many of them . Some have arms that move and pivot ? a facility the soldiers of our own lamented childhood never enjoyed . One new idea we saw is a mechanical accordion which plays a perforated roll but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . We were told that it is bought mostly by grown-ups with a flair for practical jokes . The sight of a genuine cowhide briefcase made us ponder . Do small boys have fun with briefcases , we wondered ? We had just decided that times had changed and the earth gone into a sombre phase , when we caught sight of a row of Teddy Bears and a cowboy outfit . We felt much relieved and winked at a stuffed doll . These Days of Crime ASEVEN-year-old youngster , of whom we hear from a doctor friend of his family , is a reader of the crime news . Thus , when the lad 's father called the house the other evening and got his son on the phone , he made a mistake when he said : " Tell mamma that papa is tied up at the office and ca n't get home . " Instead of telling mamma the child excitedly ' bawled for the police . When patrolmen failed to materialize he took to unintelligible shrieking . Finally the doctor was called in and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally . When he was assured that papa was not strapped to a desk , but , as mother grimly- added , probably playing fiddly-winks with several other gentlemen , the peace of the household was restored . Bronze FORTUITOUSLY we were at Epstein exhibit in the Ferargil Galleries last week when Mr. Epstein THE NEW YORKER 21 himself came in . A woman reporter , lurking in waft , pounced upon him and we baldly played eavesdropper . Asked how long he would be in New York , he said , " That 's impertinent . " Making an expansive gesture toward his bronzes he said , " That is my story . " He acted em-barrassed and blushed fre-quently . A question about his ancestors elicited the oracular remark , " I am a biological sport . " Pressed further , he said , " Ethnolog-ically , I am a Latin . " When the flustered reporter ventured a query about opera and the theatre , he asked brusquely why she did n't write about his work . On the subject of hobbies he said , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like being here for an exhibition because for me it is a sterile period . I will not stay long ? ' His questioner was encouraged . " After twenty-five years ' absence , do you find New York more like a madhouse than when you left it ? " she asked . " I did n't say it was a madhouse . You said that , " he replied . Epstein was born on the lower East Side and , to the best of our knowledge , is forty-seven . There is a story that , deciding to abandon his difficult Polish name for a shorter one , he picked Epstein from a shop sign . His wife is Scotch and they have one daughter , Peggy Jean , of whom he has five busts in the present showing . Most of his life has been spent working in London , and his work has always excited controversial uproars , two of the most famous instances being over the Wilde memorial in Paris , upon which the authorities finally placed a bronze fig-leaf , and the statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of medical students one night last year painted green . His bronze Christ was sold for more than ten thousand dollars and his notable marble Venus for one tion to his own work he brought here only two pieces of sculpture  --  Egyptian hawks carved in granite about 3000 B.c. , which he keeps beside his bed . In New York Epstein is staying at an apartment in Fifty-ninth Street , a few doors from his exhibit . He is in and out of the gallery once or twice a day and his face has become familiar to those who are studying his work . He is short and stocky , and wears a wide felt hat over longish wispy hair . He has sharp black eyes , a lisp , and noticeably large hands . The artists and the patrons argue much about his things but they say that financially the exhibit is certain to be a success . An appreciable number of the forty-five pieces offered were sold during the first few days . ? ADD to list of distinguished men now driving taxis  --  Mussolini . Americana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounded to find him carrying beneath his arm several pink copies of tabloid newspapers . " Congratulate me , " he said , " they are first editions . " We discovered that he spoke as a collector . His hobby is picture papers and in order to get a clean copy , 1p ? I am not a banker . " To the news-writer 's old standby , " Do you like our skyscraper architecture ? " he snapped , " That is trite . " Abruptly he volunteered some information . " I was born here , " he said .

How many colleagues he has is not known , but the number is sufficient to lead one dealer to advertise that he carries on hand hack numbers of the tabloids . Only a specialist can enumerate the points that evaluate these treasures : a notable composograph may put a premium on the issue , for instance . A complete set of the Peaches Browning Saga is regarded as already having a definite value . One would conclude that , if bound in calf and hand-tooled with a design of entwined hearts alternating with sticks of dynamite , this would bring a pretty figure at auction . At any rate , the tabloid appears to be the latest in the collection field . Our friend justifies his hubby by pretending it is to yield tobacco money for his grandson when the latter reaches college . Well , it may , for all we know : the Public Li-r hrary has given over a room , on occasion , to displaying dime novels and penny dreadfuls collected thirty years ago . When the Graphic has become early American and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his reward ; although the Library files the Daily News there is no municipal depository for the other tabloids save the ash can . A genuine benefactor to the race , who would give posterity a picture of the Jazz Age , might see that the GralshL and the Mirror ran off a limited edition on everlasting linen paper like the Times . Tattooed Countesses SCOFFERS may say what they please about the modern young woman , but we have found that she is capable of patriotic heights of which we never dreamed . Near Lincoln Square is a dancing ' carnival which has set aside an entire section of its balcony for " gentlemen in uniform . " Here such sailors as are in port repair nightly , and always waiting for them is a group of young ladies who apparently have taken an oath never to dance with pacifists . That might be enough , but there is more . Each of these feminine patriots , we learn , is tattooed on the arm . Black Magic WHILE shaking heads sadly with official of the Health Department over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a story he told us of yarb selling in Harlem  --  another ill his department is heir to . Yarbs are herbs , also roots , powders , wishbones and oils , guaranteed to bring peace to colored folks ' firesides or unrest to their enemies , or , if you have the price , both . They are sold , at impressive prices , by soi-disanr witch doctors from the West Indies and just plain ordinary apothecaries  --  if you know the ones to go to . With the connivance of our official we print here a list of boons and banes to mankind found on the shelves of one store : Sprinkling Powder , Happy Dust , Black Cat Ankle Dust , Adam and Eve , Love Me Quick , Boss Fixed Dust , Demanding Powder Dust ( male and female ) , Black Snake Root , Sprinkling Powder No. 2 , Gaffer Dust , Chasing Away Powder ( male and female ) , Black Cat 's Ruling Hand , Black Cat 's Wishbone , Commanding Oil Green , Keep ' Em Powder . Each of these is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things . Good Keep ' Fm Powder costs ten dollars an ounce and is warranted to hold or even to bring back in errant love . Adam and Eve keeps burglars at their distance and Love Me Quick brings lovers on the run . The merits of some of the others are a little vague even to the scholarly police who are majoring in them . We like to believe , though , that a good stiff dose of Boss Fixed Dust would put one 's employer in his place . From what we hear of Commanding Oil Green we would n't give it house room , for it appears to he a lotion likely to bring practically all your hopes to realization at one time , always an annoyance to a dreamer . THERE are other magics , bootlegged only by very special bootleggers from the Indies . One is a bit of tree branch ( price fifty dollars ) which , if chewed when passing an enemy , will within a day or two cause a chimney pot to fall on him or something . This is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wings of black buzzards which have been flapped in a graveyard in the full of the moon . The price is , of course , also high on rabbit 's feet known to have scampered across a cemetery . A number of eminent witch doctors in Harlem have waxed wealthy , we are told . Their patrons are scattered far and wide . The sale THE NEW YORKER 23 of these specifics is opposed by the intellectual element in Harlem , but the charms are a religion to others and the police are not optimistic about stamping out the traffic . Retort Wifely AYOUNG wife who lives Flushing had been called from her domestic duties the other morning by so many salesmen of brushes , vanilla extract , photograph enlargements and such that she became somewhat embittered . She waited with tapping toe and eager tongue for the next intruder . When the bell rang she opened the door grimly . " Good morning , madam , " said the caller , removing his hat . " I represent the International Honie Laundry Corporation . May I explain our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come your customers . plain it . " Other Days ' ' YOthose who have made the dis- covery that the history of New York is as fine and flamboyant a tale as your six favorite novelists could write in collaboration , we recommend a visit to the sprawling mansion of the late Archibald Gracie at the foot of East Eighty-eighth Street . Here Mr. Hardinge Scholle has made a Museum of the City of New York which , by some delicacy of touch , resembles neither a curio shop nor a forgotten attic . At the moment , it is given over to an exhibition of old New York costumes which is a stimulus to any imagination that will meet it halfway . We have always felt a little sensitive about museums . Peering into glass showcases at the baby shoes of a famous general or the wedding dress of a great lady invariably gives us the feeling of an unprincipled snooper . Mr. Scholle has overcome all this by giving the garments a semblance of life . Remo Bufano , an excellent maker of marionettes , has provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godey 's Lady 's Book air . For instance , in the music room , which , for the occasion , dates hack to ISCO , is to be found not a collection of slightly worn musical instruments labelled for inspection but as bored a group of merry-makers as the period might have produced . An early nineteenth-century clinging vine , in a lovely Empire gown , holds fast to a smart young naval officer in blue swallow tail , white trousers and yellow silk stockings . He unquestionably would rather be out on the front porch watching the ships go past but realizes he must be polite and listen to an old bore in knee breeches play the piano and a wallflower strum the harp The entire exhibition is thus populated  --  a sad little lady all in green watching out the window for someone who may not have come at all , for all we know ; two sweet-faced ladies of the Victorian fifties sitting there gossiping in a manner that might not have amused the good queen ; a bride and groom of 1826 , looking a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a bit more V interested if more of the costumes had been definitely identified . For example , we found ourself much more attracted to the bridal finery when we learned it had been lent by Miss Amelia R. Foulke , whose grandfather 's eldest daughter wore it when she was married in that same Gracie mansion a century ago . We also plunged headlong into fanciful imaginings when we learned that a lovely gown of flowered silk brocade , lent by Mrs. George Thompson , was worn by her aunt to the great hall for the Prince of Wales ( Edward VII ) in 1860 , and again by her daughter at a lesser ball for the present Prince on his last visit to America The Theatre Room , whose curator is Miss May Davenport Seymour , daughter of IVill iam Seymour , the actor , is too small a stage to permit the personification of all its actors . There are , however , lifelike figures of Ethel Barrymore in the gown she wore as Madame Trentoni in " Captain finks , " James K. Hackett as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charlotte Cushman . Here and there are such scattered items as Edwin Booth 's gauntlets , Lillian Russell 's tinselled crown , Adelina Pat-ti 's slipper , Mrs. Siddons ' hair ornaments , Lawrence Barrett 's Richelieu robe , Tomasso Salvini 's handkerchief , Edwin Forrest 's jewelled dagger and mementos of Modjeska , Bernhardt , Melba , Mrs. Gilbert . Caruso and that " splendid gypsy , " the late John Drew .
