At the University of Pennsylvania three out of five students have ringworm . Half the adult population of the U. S. , and practically everybody in the South , has suffered from the disease at some time or another . So annoying is this situation that Surgeon General Hugh S. Gumming of the U. S. Health Service last week sent a special bulletin to the health officer of every community in the U. S. <P> The mildest form of the disease is a little cracking or scaling between the toes . A vegetable parasite , related to the mould that grows upon stale bread , gets deeply into the skin . Soft corns are frequently due to ringworm infection . Sometimes the mould causes blisters , scaly eruptions , wartlike growths . Blisters may break and cause a wet , oozing surface that becomes covered with scabs . <P> Ringworm is caught at swimming pools , golf clubs , athletic clubs-wherever people use common dressing rooms . Wearing can vas slippers at such places will help prevent infection , as will the strict use of personal soaps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general tendency of the American public to spend a certain amount of time in hotels is largely responsible for the increase of this disease . There is no good proof that water in swimming pools is in any way responsible . " <P> Soaking in salt solution at least once a day helps cure . Keeping the " feet off hot floors and radiators is good . Ultraviolet light seems to be beneficial . <P> Infected persons should boil their towels , socks , gloves and linens for 15 minutes to kill the ringworm organisms . They must avoid infecting others ; they should sleep with no one , at least while the disease is active .
