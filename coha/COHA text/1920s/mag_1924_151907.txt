" It has been said by some people that I will be dominated and controlled by my husband , that he will be Governor and I a dummy . Others have said I will be boss and will administer the affairs of office according to my own ideas and will not accept any counsel or advice from my husband . <P> " I think it proper to make a frank statement of my position . Some of my friends have advised me to announce that I will not listen to Mr. Ferguson 's advice or permit him to influence me in any of my official acts . I can not make a statement of that nature , for it would not be true . There has always existed that degree of confidence and understanding between Governor Ferguson and me which should exist between every husband and wife . I have always been loyal to my husband and family , and if I thought for a minute that my election would mean that our home would be broken up by destruction of the mutual confidence and respect we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . " <P> The ex-Governor put in : <P> " She will be the Governor , and if I can help her , of course , like any other citizen who is interested in her welfare and wishes her success , I will do it . But Miriam will be the Governor . Fortunately for Texas , my wife measures up to the job entrusted to her by the Democrats of the State . " <P> The state of Texas had held its second primary . The contestants were Judge Felix D. Robertson ( with Klan support ) and Miriam A. Ferguson , wife of a Governor who was impeached and removed from office in 1918 . She and her husband , who is a hot campaigner , made the Klan the issue-and " Ma " Ferguson won by a margin of about 90,000 votes in a total of almost 800,000 . In Texas , a Democratic nominee is considered as good as elected and " Ma " Ferguson is now the Democratic nominee . <P> After her victory was assured , Mrs. Ferguson summed up her opinions : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death knell of the Klan in Texas , and , furthermore , I think it a blow that is going to be felt by the Klan in every other State in which it has gained a foothold . And I will also say that I am firmly convinced that the splendid victory of the anti-Klan ticket is going to prove a godsend to our National ticket . To my way of thinking , it will be impossible from now on for the Republicans to use the Klan issue against our party . The Democrats have purged their party of this menace , but the same can not be said of the Republicans with their Klan candidates in Indiana , Maine and elsewhere . <P> " As to my course , I do n't mind saying that when I become Governor no Kluxers need apply . I will appoint no masked officeholders while I am in the Governor 's chair . The reign of the Ku Klux will end when I go in. "                  @ @ @
