txt " We are building solidly for the future , " said Pres ' . dent A. It . Erskine of Studebaker Corp . to a representativ- , of Dow , Jones S Co. , " both in the quality we are maintaining for our product and the strength of the company behind that product . ? our cash holdings have been increased this year and now stand at upward of *17,000,000 after deducting about $2,000,000 in dividends paid September 1 . Viewed from any angle , the corporation is in the strongest financial position in its history . " The automobile business continues at a surprising rate and I look for a big third quarter . Our sales in July and August amounted to 25,000 cars and September 's business will probably bring the total to more than 33,000 for the third quarter . We have been operating close to capacity since March 1 , and there arc at present no signs of any severe let-up . About 55 ' ; ' , . of our production is now in closed models . " We are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to August 1 exceeded the total for the entire 1024 year . Therefore the exports of the current five months will represent a clear gain over last year . " Mr. Erskine declined to discuss earnings , but intimated that the forecast which he has already made of the third quarter 's net could be accepted notwithstanding price reductions recently made . He stated at the time that the outlook for the third quarter indicated earnings and sales double those of the corresponding period in 1024 .

Added to the first six months ' showing of $5.24 , this would bring the earnings of the first nine months to around $14.000.000. or between $7 and $7.50 a share . On the prospect for an increase in the dividend payments this year , or an extra dividend in addition to the present $4 annual rate on the common , Mr. Erskine likewise refused to comment , stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their meeting at the end of October . Studebaker 's sales of 35.000 cars in the third quarter , would compare with 42.034 cars in the second quarter this year aria 29.937 in the first three months . It would represent the second largest third quarter in the histor-. of the corporation and compare with the previous recor total etabilslicsi in the third quarter of 1023 at 40.503 cars . It would be almost double the 18.921 cars sold it . the corresponding quarter of last year . The degree to which Studebaker has strengthened it , cash holdings is indicated by comparison with its stand , mg in this respect at the beginning of the year when the , corporation bad around $5,000.000 in cash and 534100,00a in bank loans ' the bank loans have been entirely liquidated.
