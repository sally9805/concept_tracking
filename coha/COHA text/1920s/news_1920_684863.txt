But For $250,000 the contracting firm will push the steel installations Immediately and buy lumber enough to put up all the forms at once , so that the I concrete work can all be done at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . The link builder asks that taxpayers write him postal cards approving or disapproving of his scheme .
