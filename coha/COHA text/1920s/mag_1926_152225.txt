The Importance of Being Earnest . Oscar Wilde is probably the least played of all the important dramatists* of the ' 90s . It is believed by shrewd financiers of the theatre that epigrams will not keep . These men are right , as usual , from a financial viewpoint . It is doubtful whether the engaging and lancelike humors of this piece will interest a great many people for a protracted period . On the other hand , the production seems one of the very few this season that the true lover of the theatre can not afford to miss . <P> Wilde is a playwright exceedingly sensitive to production . The Actors ' Theatre has done amazingly well by him this time and the results are most diverting . Lucille Watson , Patricia Collinge , Reginald Owen , Vernon Steele and Dudley Digges were shrewd selections for the various delicately incisive roles . Strangely enough even the epigrams seem to have survived sturdily- " The truth is rarely pure and never simple " - " Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the weather I always feel quite certain they mean something else . " - " Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit ; touch it and the bloom is gone " - " I never travel without my diary . One should always have something sensational to read in the train . " <P> The play , as every one knows , is one of the most conversationally glittering that Wilde wrote . The genre is well described in a book just published which purports to contain spirit messages direct from the author : " My plays were scarcely drama . They were more the weaving of character into a pattern ; and this , with the use of language which I chose in each instance , to illustrate the surface of the human being . I did not propose to go deeply into the heart , as it is called-that organ , which is so frequently maligned , did not interest me . " In this book Author Wilde also describes his entrance to London , " this huge heap of Philistinism , " as a young man : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devouring too much bread . ... It seemed a foolish thing to go on living in such a world . . . " <P> <P> Kitty 's Kisses is an unimportant musical comedy with a shattering succession of excellent dance numbers . It has been made over from an old farce which once amused for an inconsiderable period as Little Miss Brown . About half of the original was eliminated to make room for song and dance about a girl who strayed into the wrong hotel bedroom . The music and the foolishness are mostly routine . Dorothy Dilley and a vaudeville team called Wayne and Warren are the most capable performers . <P> <P> The Sport of Kings . Ian Hay ( Beith ) is not now so well known as he was during the War . His battle writings roused interest in his novels ; his lectures spread the advertisement . Of late he has withdrawn somewhat from the general consciousness . He returns with a chaotic farce about betting on horse races . It is not likely to add to his repute .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
