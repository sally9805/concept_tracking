Not only is the industry operating at something like 60% capacity , compared to 15% last July and about 33% at close of year , but the tone of the market is decidedly healthy . There are some trade pessimists still , but the men who foresaw the depression nearly two years ago are the ones who express greatest confidence today . Price advances instituted within the past ten days by a number of independents are considered likely to hold . The Steel Corporation has taken no ? official action . yet , but as it has been for months following the policy of meeting competition it may he regarded as certain that it is actually quoting the independent levels already . CUST0 ) 1ERS GET PRICE ADVANTAGE There is reason to believe that - manufacturers who have advanced quotations are giving customers the opportunity to get tonnage on books at recent levels . One satisfactory feature of the price situation is that first advance was announced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time has been a sore spot in trade . Jones &; Laughlin apparently decided to " find the bottom of the market " and slashed prices'ruthlessly to this end . Now it seems to be satisfied it has sounded absolute rock bottom . has booked up backlog and is in position to demand better selling level . New prices for heavy products . $1.50 a hundred pounds , are $4 a ton above lowest quotations reached on downward move . ? In fact , Jones S.

All signs also point to activity in building materiel by early summer .

Interest here at present is largely centered in coal labor situation : Feeling is practically unanimous that strike would be best thing that could occur , as operators are confident a showdown will greatly weaken the power of the unions . It is pointed out that , compromise would be in vain , as operators ' offer is around level paid in nonunion mines and union mines , unless the scale offered goes into effect , would remain closed down . Lower coal wages would be of benefit to all manufacturing industries and would probably have influence towards readjusting wage scales in other trades which are still out of line .
