txt The Alien Land bill which the Mexican Congress has passed , but which has not yet been signed by President CALLES , is viewed with distrust by Americans . It provides that " no. " alien shall acquire direct ownership " in lands and waters in a strip of 100 " kilometers along frontiers or of 50 " kilometers on the coasts . " Nor can an alien be a shareholder in Mexican companies owning lands so situated . Apparently this legislation looks to the future . In principle it is , say the Mexicans , as old as the Spanish occupation . The purpose of it was defensive . In 1S12 the Spanish law was re-enacted , and again in 1824 and 1854 . Foreigners , it is declared , chiefly Americans , have acquired lands on the Mexican side of the United States border , also coast property in. various parts of Mexico . It is the policy of the Mexican Government to prevent the passing of titles to aliens ityfuture . So long as such legislation is not construed to be retroactive ' there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , in a provision of the hand bill which requires that an alien shareholder in a Mexican company owning land , or concessions , for the exploitation - of " mines , waters or combustible minerals , " shall agree not to invoke the protection of his Government " in case " of failing in tote agreement or losing " for the benefit of the nation " the property in question . The meaning seems clear enough : the alien must not ask his Government to intervene , but must have recourse to the local courts if the Mexican Government takes over the land by what we call the right of eminent domain , or otherwise winds up the business of the coinPany . But it might happen that the action of the Mexican Government was high-handed and arbitrary . To attempt to bind an alien to deny himself an appeal to his own Government would appear to be unreasonable . The proposed law Would keep in the hands of the Mexicans control of companies ( Mexican companies it calls them ) owning rural property for agricultural purposes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into effect of " this law " have had title to a 50 Per /cent. or a majority interest they may " retain it until their death in " the case of physical persons , or for " ten years in the case of moral pe , - " sons ( corporations ) . " Here the alien corporation win have cause for protest , fearing that confiscation . How can the Mexicans explain away the retroactive nature of it ? In another paragraph inheritance of the individual 's interest is dealt with ; he is bidden to go to the courts for his rights and there obtain a " permit " . for adjudication . The bill will be productive *of misunderstandings because the meaning of provisions is not always clear to the alien mind , and because it suspects the Mexican Government of hostility @ to alien proprietors . Discussion may remove ambiguities , especially when the Mexican view is understood . The ' Mexicans , for instance , point to the waiver written into share certificates of Mexican oil companies of the right to appeal to alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute . But this is a question for the State Department and the lawyers . - 4t may be supposed that President CALLES will allow time for negotiation before acting upon the Land bill . The Mexican Constitution , by the way , contains this declaration : " To no law shall there be given re " troactive effect to the prejudice or " any person . "
