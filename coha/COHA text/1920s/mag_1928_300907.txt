<P> Four months from the day Alfred Emanuel Smith is inaugurated President , if he is inaugurated , practically every industry in the U. S. will close its doors and absolutely cease functioning . Of the truth of this sweeping prediction , often made by Republicans , there can not be the slightest doubt . <P> The same prediction is made sometimes by Democrats-that in the event Herbert Clark Hoover is inaugurated on March 4. the " vast , " the " stupendous , " the " intricate , " " delicate , " " finely adjusted " mechanism of U. S. business to which Nominee Hoover so often and so seriously alludes , will arrive at an almost total standstill four months later . <P> Of the truth of this Democratic prediction there is equally little doubt-in fact , no doubt whatever . <P> Because , as currently pointed out by a growing body of predicters , four months from March 4 is July 4 , famed national holiday .                  @ @ @
