The King-Emperor moved three chessmen upon the board of State , and in a flash one was taken by an unseen player , Death . The coincidence , startling , roused keen interest in the three august chessmen : <P> Lord Cave . Lying invalid in his Somersetshire home of Burnham-on-Sea , George Viscount Cave , 72 , felt his strength definitely impaired , last week , and executed in good time his resignation as Lord High Chancellor . The incumbent of this office is the highest civil subject in the land outside the royal family . He keeps the King 's conscience , sits on the Woolsack as Speaker of the House of Lords , surmounts the pyramid of English judges , partakes of membership in the Cabinet , and performs such chores as standing guardian of all infants and lunatics . <P> The King-Emperor , upon receiving the resignation of Viscount Cave , and being , doubtless aware of his critical condition , promptly elevated him to the rank of Earl . His charm , straightforwardness , and singularly active common sense were recalled as men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has held : Attorney General to Edward of Wales ( 1914-15 ) , Solicitor General ( 1915-16 ) , Home Secretary ( 1916-19 ) and , since 1924 , Lord High Chancellor . <P> Most lamentably the effects of an abdominal operation brought Death to Earl Cave last week after he had enjoyed his new title for less than a day . Of him the London Times , said with a justice finer than eulogy , " Although he can not be reckoned among the greatest in the long , brilliant roll of Lord High Chancellors of England , he must rank as a sound lawyer . . . . None excelled him in ... sanity of judgment . " <P> Sir Douglas Hogg . Someone must always be Lord High Chancellor , but to have chosen a new one fit to rank " among the greatest , " last week , would probably have meant returning to the Woolsack the brilliant Earl of Birkenhead , who sat thereon during 1919-22 , but is now Secretary of State for India . Patently Lord Birkenhead does not want to impair his chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot arena of politics to the lofty precincts of the Lord High Chancellor . Therefore , last week , His Majesty was " advised " by the Baldwin Cabinet to call to the Lord High Chancellorship another " sound lawyer , " Attorney General Sir Douglas McGarel Hogg . But Sir Douglas is much more than a sound lawyer with a greater legal earning power than any Britisher except Sir John Simon . <P> He is a powerful parliamentary debater . He has earned his reward , especially of late , by tirelessly conducting the defense of the Cabinet before the House of Commons on a multiplicity of bills and issues which must have kept him slaving over the preparation of his speeches through many a night . Withal , rubicund Sir Douglas Hogg , who greatly resembles Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill , has kept his cheeks pink , his temper cool , his jokes fresh , his judgment sound . <P> His Majesty , before graciously appointing Sir Douglas as Lord High Chancellor last week , thoughtfully created him a baronet . Thus his title of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights though below barons .
