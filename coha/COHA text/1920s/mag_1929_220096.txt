FARTHING HALL-Hugh Walpole and J. B. Priestley-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> Mark French , youthful painter , Robert Newlands , less youthful Oxford Don , were both conducting parlous affairs of the heart ; and had it not been for their eighteenth century habit of writing each to the other as confidant , neither affair would have turned out so satisfactorily . Into the Lake Country Mark pursued his love-at-first-sight , a charming bit of femininity out of Jane Austen , or-remembering her ferocious father and mysterious exile at Farthing Hall-Jane Eyre . Mark had no sooner wrung from her a timid confession of love than she dismissed him , insisting that her duty lay with the ferocious parent . <P> Distrait , Mark appealed to his friend , but Robert 's letters brought no solace-only the melancholy news that his own wife had left him , because forsooth he had been rude to an old hag of a spiritualist . <P> A small coincidence , deftly nurtured , came to the lovers ' aid . The hag fell in love with the ferocious parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the timid heroine melted into the arms of her rescuer , and they all lived happily ever afterward . <P> W'hether the romantic youth 's letters are written by Mr. Walpole , and those of the gently cynical forty-year-old by Mr. Priestley , is not vouchsafed ; but the guess is no great hazard . The combination is pleasant narrative , happy and inconsequential .
