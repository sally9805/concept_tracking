Walter Hampden , only prominent actor-manager in the U. S. theatre , * was last week elected president of The Players . He succeeds the late John Drew and , according to the tradition of the club , will hold the post until death . Other presidents have been Edwin Booth , the founder ; Joseph Jefferson . <P> Since the death of John Drew ( TIME , July 18 ) there have been rumblings of controversy . The other leading candidates for president were Francis Wilson , the only charter member eligible ( the president must be a prominent actor ) , and Otis Skinner . Mr. Skinner was a leader of the Actors ' Fidelity League which opposed the now sovereign Actors ' Equity at the time of the actors ' strike in 1919 . The hard feeling between these organizations , which is only now fading , was rumored to have raised factions in The Players . Mr. Wilson has always been a most ardent Equity protagonist . Any suggestion of schism was dispelled when Mr. Hampden was unanimously elected . <P> Walter Hampden is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famed Polytechnic Preparatory School ; then Harvard University ; then studied abroad . He first appeared on the stage as " a walking gentleman " in Sir Frank R. Benson 's company in 1901 at Brighton , England . In recent years he has been chiefly associated with classic roles ; presenting one of the most widely known Hamlets in the U. S. , and the most popular present-day revival of Cyrano de Bergerac , generally considered his best role . He has his own Manhattan theatre in which he presents revivals and occasional new plays in a gradually widening repertory . Last year his play was Caponsacchi , based on Browning 's The Ring and the Book . This season he plays Ibsen 's An Enemy of the People . His real name is Walter Hampden Dougherty . <P> On New Year 's Eve , 1887 , a group of friends gathered at Edwin Booth 's home ( remodeled by Stanford White ) in Gramercy Park , Manhattan . Shortly before midnight he disclosed to them a plan dear to his heart . He would found an actor 's club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , and in which the best of the writing , painting and music world might come to learn that the actor , too , is a gentleman . Mr. Booth was distressed at the slight repute in which his profession was held before the world . He would give his home to this club ; his treasures of the theatre . The Players stands today in the same little house as a memorial to this great actor 's dream . <P> Every year at 11:30 on New Year 's Eve , the members gather . A representative actor reads Booth 's dedication speech , which ends close to the stroke of midnight . At that stroke Walter Oettel , Booth 's dresser in the theatre , now the superintendent of the club , passes a cup in which the members drink the health of this hale old tradition .
