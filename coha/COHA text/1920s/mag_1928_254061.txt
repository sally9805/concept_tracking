Bloodthirst hankered for three weeks in Vernon and Rapides Parishes , La. , after the killing of Deputy Sheriff J. Frank Phillips by William Blackman , black man . Police slew Blackman in turn , promptly .

Three deputies fetched them in a car , one day last week . <P> The customary thing took place . A score of armed men stepped out of ambush . The deputies were ordered to move on , which they did .
