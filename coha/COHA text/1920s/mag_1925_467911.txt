HERE are three characteristic traits of American politics at the present moment , all of which can be related to one central fact at Washington : bolting the party in the West ; damning the government in the East ; forgetting about States ' Rights in the South . You can not open your evening newspaper , see a news reel at the movies , or tune in on a radio station without finding something which bears upon these tendencies . A Congressman from North Dakota demands that his party " do something " for the farmer , and his party retaliates by taking away his badge and not asking him to its next convention . An after-dinner speaker arises in the East ( as Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler recently arose ) and asserts that American democracy is fast becoming American despotism because we have too much government at Washington . A Senator ( Mr. Smith ) from the state of South Carolina , which first adopted an ordinance of secession from the Union , now appears in Congress and submits a bill which authorizes the federal authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of state affairs , and spend thirty million dollars doing it . Incidents like these suggest three tendencies : In the West we have an agrarian radicalism which demands that Washington bestir itself and take a greater interest in the troubles of the farmer ; assume more power to deal with railways , trusts , and middlemen ; lend millions on farm mortgages ; become increasingly a great central agency of control and regulation . In some such faith as this lies the chief strength of the La Follette movement . In the East , meantime , this program meets with signs of rapidly increasing irritation . Give Washington more power ? Not much . Washington is drunk with power now . We hear most , to be sure , Tram those who are best able to express themselves ; and this ordinarily means tnembers of a well-to-do section of society who have access to the news columns of the press through one public forum or another . But these people ? possessors of more than average influence ? are emphatic in their views . They do not want more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want less government in business . They want less taxes . They emphatically do not want more taxes , wherewith to set the government up in banking ventures or insurance schemes , or to buy the excess wheat of Western farmers . They like the Mellon plan . They like economy at Washington , and economy which includes lopping off whole government activities as well as saving on the blotters and ink-wells . They like federal retrenchment . They like being left alone . A popular address for any bankers ' , merchants ' , or manufacturers ' convention east of Chicago could be written around the two phrases " do n't meddle with business " and " government is best when it governs least . " Then , in the South , where loyalty to States ' Rights is traditional and , theoretically , the doctrine still survives that it is dangerous to pile too many burdens on the shoulders of one government in Washington , we find Congressmen headed for the Capitol , forgetful of States ' Rights and bent upon putting Washington up to all manner of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas appears in Congress and proposes that the federal government invade the States with federal schools . Senator Harris of Georgia turns to the railways , and wishes the federal government to be in so many places at one time that anywhere and everywhere it can forbid the use of wooden cars . Representative Upshaw of Georgia asks the federal government to come into every local theater and , with one commission centralized at Washington , censor the morals of the movies . From the South , all traditions of States ' Rights notwithstanding , comes a great deal of that leadership which brushes States ' Rights aside and centralizes in Washington more authority than Washington has ever had before . This change in point of view is recent ; but it is unmistakable . For it is Southern leadership , plus Western leadership , which has taken away from the States ? for one thing ? power to decide whether or not they will have Prohibition , and has conferred that power on the nation . It is Southern leadership , plus Western leadership , which has sent the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars on farm mortgages . It is Southern and Western leadership which has set the federal governrnent building roads and teaching schools , taking over responsibilities which the States once carried for themselves , acquiring each year authority which previously belonged to States , to cities , or remained undelegated . In the shift of the South toward federalism , in the demand of the West for farm aid , in the reluctance with which the East views each new dollar spent in Washington and each new onward thrust of federal power , we have three real factors in the political scene of 1925 . The fact at Washington which relates these factors is the federal subsidy . For many years this country had no federal subsidies . The States managed their own affairs and paid their own expenses as they went along . The federal government was content to stay in Washington . Even down to 1914 , federal subsidies to the States were only a small item in the national budget , amounting in that year to six and a half million dollars , and voted to the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard . Six and a half million was less than one per cent of the government 's expenses in 1914 . In 1914 , however , came the Smith-Lever Act and the outlay for subsidies took a new turn upward . The Smith-Lever Act had to do with agricultural extension work ; it voted direct subsidies to the States for demonstrations in farm methods and home economics . Originally Congress appropriated $1,080,000 for this purpose . But what Congress originally appropriates is very likely to be doubled or redoubled later , and the Smith-Lever Aut has grown each year . Last year the appropriation was $5,880,000 . Meantime , with the Smith-Lever Act as a precedent , Congress began enacting other laws conferring other subsidies upon the States for other local purposes . In 1916 came the Federal Aid for Roads Act . Beginning modestly , this act has grown each year until for 19e4 the Budget Bureau has it down for $63 ; 000,000 . Other subsidy laws have followed . And with the direct subsidies have come increased appropriations for such purposes as rivers and harbors , reclamation work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strictly be classed as a subsidy , since the federal government retains title to the property which its appropriation improves . Nevertheless $100,000 voted to dredge the Hudson is actually as much a matter of state aid as $100,000 voted under the Act of 1916 to help New York build a new state road . And so , if we wish to measure the full scope of federal contributions to the States , we shall count subsidies both direct and indirect ; and for the year 1924 those subsidies were as follows : This figure of $187,507,340 is instructive . It represents the entirely novel degree to which the federal government now stakes the States to projects which were once thought to be the States ' own business . We have come so far with subsidies that one dollar in every seven which Congress appropriates ( aside from more or less routine sums to pay interest on the national debt and provide for the national defense ) is appropriated nowadays for State assistance . It is the last ten years that have worked this change . We have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to come when they need funds , They need funds constantly . And in the difference between what one State pays the treasury in taxes , and another State takes away from the treasury in subsidies , lies one explanation of those three current tendencies in West , East , and South described above . For there is nothing mathematical about subsidies . They do not work themselves out in such a way that the State which pays most receives most in return , or the most populous State is granted appropriations in proportion to its numbers . What determines the size of subsidies is a variety of local conditions plus the effectiveness of bloc organization in Washington . Consider , for example , the cases of Nevada and New York . New York , with its concentration of capital and its banking interests , is the greatest tax-paying State in the union . Last year it paid $474,000,000 in taxes on personal and corporation income . It received in return $4,020,445 under the six subsidy laws ( Smith-Lever Act , Federal Aid for Roads Act , etc. ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than one per cent on its tax payment . Nevada , meantime , paid into the federal treasury last year the sum of $408 , - 793 , but took out of the federal treasury ( under these same six subsidy measures ) the sum of $885,759 ? a return of over 216 per cent on its investment . Being a member of the Union , in the case of Nevada , is a very profitable venture . Now the difference between returns in these two cases the quite amazing difference between 0.84 per cent and 216.67 per cent ? is an exceptional instance in the working out of subsidies , and no other two States show such a striking variation . Nevertheless , these figures are indicative of a certain general tendency . And if the test of tax-payment and subsidy-return is applied to the whole country it will be seen , I think , that if New York and Nevada are two extreme cases they are none the less cases which represent a very genuine difference between the East and West . . It is a comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , which affords the best test . In the figures which follow I have used the conventional groupings : " New England " . comprises the six States from Connecticut to Maine . " Middle Atlantic " comprises New York , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey . " Middle West " comprises Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Wisconsin , Michigan . " South " includes all States below the Mason and Dixon line , and as far west as Texas . " West " includes all States from the Mississippi to the Coast States , the South excluded . " Pacific " comprises Washington , Oregon , and California . This table shows , first , what each section paid in federal taxes on personal and corporation income in 1924 ; second , what each section received in the form of federal subsidies in 1924 ; and third , what percentage this receipt bears to the sum paid in taxes : Two figures stand out here ? the figures for the South and West . While the factory States of New England , the great tax-paying States of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tier of industrial and farming States of the Middle West show returns at such low figures as 2 .. 61 per cent , 2.04 per cent , and 4.89 per cent , the South comes back from Washington with 22.65 per cent of what it pays in taxes , and the West with 28.99 per cent . The Pacific Coast fares better than the East . But it is a poor third . Between the South and West on one side , and the rest of the country on the other , there is a wide gulf here in a very fundamental matter of taxation and division of receipts . It is surely a factor of some political importance that the West profits from subsidies no less than fourteen times as substantially as do the chief tax-paying States of the Atlantic seaboard . Now , it does not necessarily follow that because the South and West fare so well in subsidies they are taking an unfair advantage of their neighbors . If States like Nevada and Arkansas are now enriching themselves at the expense of States like New York and Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . For one thing it is obvious that the great Eastern States , as investment markets and as gateways to foreign trade , derive an incidental profit from any subsidy which raises property values in the South and West . New York City , far example , is a port and a market which owes much of its prosperity to the prosperity of its hinterland . Nevada benefits most from a subsidy spent in Nevada ; but New York is not entirely a loser . In the second place it is , of course , true that direct title to some of the property which is improved through subsidies in the Western and Southern States is held in the financial East . And in the third place , it would be folly to forget the tariff . For years , admittedly , the industrial States of the East have enjoyed protection for their industries in a competitive world market . They have had the taxing power of the government applied for their own benefit , in another form of " subsidy " ? some men think rightly , others wrongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if the South and West now manipulate federal financial policy to some special sectional advantage it is not without a precedent . Such points as these are relevant to the argument about subsidies : the argument as to whether sectional advantages for the South and West are now warranted or are not warranted . But that argument I do not attempt to touch . The purpose of this paper is neither to defend subsidies nor attack them . It is rather to discuss what happens and note briefly its results . And certainly in these variations of sectional advantage and disadvantage we have a factor which belongs in any consideration of the political line-up that exists to-day : Here is the East , receiving in subsidies a pittance in return for what it pays in taxes . Subsidies increase , and yet the East does worse and worse for itself in Washington . For the East can never profit heavily from subsidies . It can never profit heavily because subsidies are , and will be , voted chiefly for such projects as forestation , new roads , and reclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . Besides , the East pays such enormous taxes that federal bequests of modest size affect its standing but slightly . And the result is what might be expected . If the East sees a State like Nevada profiting from subsidies at better than the rate of two hundred per cent on its tax payment , while the best a State like New York can do is a return of less than one per cent , then the East is likely to conclude that the whole subsidy process is all abomination . We have here not the whole explanation why the East is anti-subsidy , anti-centralization , antigovernment in business ? why it likes the Mellon plan and wishes Washington would crawl back modestly into a smaller shell ? but we have one cogent factor . Meantime , and with the logic of the same equation , we have a new discovery in the South . The discovery is that Washington is a good place to come for State assistance . The East may find subsidies unprofitable ; the South does better . Each of these subsidy measures is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should finance their own affairs ; each , because it is paid solely upon condition that the States surrender a little more authority to Washington , is a direct invasion of States ' Rights . But these considerations do not check the enthusiasm of Southern Congressmen . The Treasury is the Treasury , rich in its promise of State aid ; and there is not a single State-invading subsidy of the last ten years which Southern leadership and Southern votes have failed to help through Congress . The authors of three of the first four subsidies were Southern men . Finally , there is the West , with that agrarian radicalism which demands farm loans , farm boards , farm blocs , and a general extension of the authority of the federal government to deal with local problems of the wheat belt . It is surely no accident that the La Follette movement is strong where subsidies are strong , and weak where subsidies are weak . Mr. La Follette 's best territory in the last election was in the West and on the Pacific Coast ; those two sections are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be ignored in this reckoning because at present it is immovably Democratic ) on the list of sections showing profitable returns from subsidies . Mr. La Follette 's next best section was the Middle West ; that is , the next best section on the list of subsidies . Mr. La Follette 's worst showing was in New England and the East ; that is where subsidies are regarded with small favor . By themselves , of course , subsidies arc no more the whole explanation of the La Follette movement in the West than they are the whole explanation of the Mellon movement in the East or the movement toward federalism in the South . But they arc an integral part of all three movements , and the first point of attack . There is a factor here which is developing a new set of alternatives within the two-party system of American politics , and a factor of more substance with each year that passes . For we are not in the last lap of subsidies . We are in the first lap of subsi- And we are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit most from the business of subsidies have just begun to realize the opportunities inherent in bloc action . Within recent months Congress has enacted still another subsidy measure in addition to those listed here ? the Clarke-McNary Act , appropriating 8 ' 2,800,000 annually to subsidize state forestation work . Another subsidy measure was debated in committee -- the Sterling Bill , appropriating $100,000,000 with which to subsidize state education . A score of other subsidy bills were submitted to Congress in its last session . And it is a reasonably safe guess that there will be more of them at the next session . The subsidy issue will be argued with more and more insistence by its friends among the blocs . And as it is argued it will raise , more or less inevitably , new questions of tax- ' . -9 and division of receipts , new ques-f federal authority , of centrali-a method versus decentraliza- as a safe way out . Obviously those - questions are the sort which touch the first-hand interests of the voter ? how is he to vote ? Our parties , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the same Republican party which contains the farm bloc of Senator Capper ? a bloc ardently in favor of more subsidies ? contains also the business bloc of Mr. Mellon and Senator Butler , as ardently against them . The same Democratic party which con-tains a pro-subsidy contingent from the agricultural South contains an anti-sub-sidy contingent from the industrial East . And the La Follette movement , which Vot , . CLI. ? No. 9n1. -6 has managed to consolidate a good deal of subsidy enthusiasm in the West , does not penetrate the South at all ? and will not , in the present order of affairs . Whether the result will be to bring about a new party realignment in this country , with parties which do not try so endlessly to face both ways at once , is a point which lends itself to speculation ; but such speculation should not obscure the fact that , in a very real sense of the word and upon a very wide range of questions , that realignment is already here . What else does it mean when West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East ? What else does it mean when members of Congress so easily ignore their party tags , so readily cross the party aisle in both directions , so willingly forget their Republicanism or their Democracy , to vote as big-tax men or little-tax men , big-subsidy men or little-subsidy men , big city men or little city men , friends or foes of State aid in schools and roads and reclamation ? In the West we have agrarian radicalism , demanding that Washington assume new responsibilities and new powers . In the East we have rebellion against taxes , coupled with insistence that the government retrench . In the South we have States ' Rights left ? a mere shadow of the States ' Rights of fifty years ago ? with a hundred busy legislators writing bills which strip the States of power . One factor which threads these tendencies and helps explain their motive is the subsidy . There is a new issue taking on importance in our politics , and on both sides it calls for volunteers .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
