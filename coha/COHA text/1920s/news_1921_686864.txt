txt 1 am able to outline the peaceful method which may be suggested to satisfy the Irish principle of independence and which good Judges of both Irish and English opinion think may succeed . It is based on the fact that England already has recognized Informally , but no less effectively , the existence of the Irish republic . All correspondence with Prime Minister Lloyd George has been conducted by Mr. de Valera as president of the Irish republic on letterheads of the " Free State of Ireland . " Mr. Lloyd George by receiving and answering these letters is considered to have accepted this fact . Dail Meeting ' Openly . The republican parliament is meeting openly In Dublin , guarded by the republican polic6 and the British police as well . Republican officials communicate daily with Dublin Castle , seat of the British government for Ireland , and republican liaison officers daily meet officers of equal rank in the British army . On this basis England already has recognized Ireland 's freedOm . Mr. de Valera has said If Ireland Is set free it is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all military and naval privileges it thinks necessary for its safety , and it would be possible for the Dall , stead of accepting the British proposals , to offer the same terms to Great Britain by a treaty , coming freely into the British commonwealth of nations and binding Itself by a solemn treaty to remain as an equal partner In the empire . One other qualification may be necessary . Mr. Lloyd George has adopted Gen. Smuts ' suggestion for a guarantee of Ireland 's status by the domonions . Many Irish would prefer a foreign guarantee , preferably American . That England so far has rejected , but it is thought might be persuaded to agree for the sake of peace and friendship .
