txt Henry Ford , who urged the railroads of the country to " get rid of the unproductive stockholders , " has been blocked by the Interstate Commerce Commission in an alleged attempt to " get rid of " the minority stockholders in the Detroit , Toledo &; Ironton Railroad CorApany , Mr. Ford 's interesting railroad adventure . Notice of the decision against Henry Ford was received yesterday in a registered letter from the Interstate Com merce Commission at Washington by ' Alexander L. Strouse , of Frank , Weil &; Strouse , 181 Madison Avenue , counsel for some of the smalltockholders . Leon Tanenbaum and Benjamin M. Strauss of this city and several others , who charged that Mr. Ford was trying to " freeze them out , " remain as active associates , though ou a smail scale , in the automobile manufacturer 's railroad enterprise . These men have refused offers of several times the market value of the stock and have represented themselves as determined to remain business colleagues of Mr. Ford , in spite of the latter 's well-known aversion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign against Jews . The holdings of the minority stockholders are less than 2 per cent . of the total . Stockholders ' contention . The minority stockholders in tneirproceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission alleged that Ford had tried to destroy their rights in the D. , T. &; I. by leasing the property to.a company owned exclusively by the Ford family . They opposed the lease as , being against public interest and being purely a device to deprive the small stockholders of any influence or share of profit in the enterprise . The decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission upholding the Minority stockholders against Ford and denying permission to make the lease was rendered on Tuesday of last week . The proceedings had created widespread interest , especially among small holders of stock in different railroads , because of Ford 's denunciation of what he called " Unproductive stockholders . " He had asserted in interviews that the future of the railroads was imperilled by the necessity of paying large dividends to them . Dividends , according to the automobile man , should go only to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employes of the road , persons active in the management and others who continued to contribute actively to its success . The lease transferring everything of value from the old company to the new would have left the minority stockholders , according to ? their contention , holding a 2 per cent . interest in the hollow shell of the old company and no interest at - all in , the new . They alleged that they were victims of an attempt by Ford to translate his railroad theories into practice . Mr. Ford 's Statements . During the course of the litigation , interviews and statements by Ford , telling what he would do if the Pennsylvania or New York Central were turned over to him , were held to have an interesting bearing on the legal merits of the case , as showing what was going on in Mr. Ford 's mind at the time he sought to engineer the alleged " freezeout " lease . Mr. Strouse made application for permission to cross-examine Ford . One of the statements of Mr. Ford , ridiculing arguments as to the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock from railroad manipulation , was printed by the United States Chamber of Commerce as an authorized interview . In it Mr. Ford urged the policy of " getting rid of the unproductive stockholder , " end continued : " Of course , if such a course were attempted , we would expect a great outcry for the protection of invested capital . It would . be said that people had bought these stocks for the financial protection of their families , their children . Protection from what ? From the necessity of : arning their living . Their children would be better off if they had to finance themselves . " Proper financing would , of course.1 be easier on new roads . On the old ones , however , it should be possible to retire the parasite , nob-contributing stockholder ' and get the ownership into proper hands . " When an attempt was made after the issuance of this statement to question Mr. Ford about the object and purposes ' of the lease In - his own railroad enterprise , he made no further efforts to push the lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W111 Not Part With Stock . Leon Tanenbaum , the largest of the small stockholders , who is a well-known real estate man of this city , said last night at his residence , 315 Central Park West , that he had no intention to part with his stock. , I thInk  --  Ford is a very clever fellow , " he said . " I think he is a wonderful business man and that Is why I want to hang on . " I would not give him credit for performing any miracles in the management of the Detroit , Toledo &; Ironton as yet , but I hope he will perform some . Last year the ad-paid interest on its bonds and earned 4 per cent . on its preferred stock and 2 per cent . on its/common , much better than - it had done for years . " I have always had faith in the road . I have hung on to the stock through assessments and troubles of every kind for twenty-five years and I have no desire to:let out just when its future is becoming hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the railroads. as costs are receding . I do n't wish to antagonize Mr. Ford in tiny way . I have great admiration for him and want to stick to him . " Mr. Tanenbaum , who has a suit in the New York courts to restrain action by the officers of the company on the alleged " freeze-out " lease , admitted in that suit that Ford had dealt generously with the holders of 98 per cent . of the stock . paying them much more than the market price and offering the same to him . The road , as described in the papers in ' the suit , was a valuable property , hut in a hopeless condition for lack of funds for development at the time Ford took it over . Ford had originally been approached with a request for a loan . He and other Detroit men had been asked to tape an interest in the road as patriotic Detroiters , because of the importance of the line to that city . Ford , in his reply , said that he realized it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thou= sand or a few millions into a property that needed complete rehabilitation , so he decided to but the whole thing or have nothing to do with it . Ford 's Price Accepted . Most of the stockholders were in New York . They were quickly induced to accept the price of $5 a share for the preferred stock and $1 a share for the common , several times the market price at the time . Henry Ford 's total outlay for the road , however , was placed at $5,000,000 and the intrinsic value of the property was estimated by witnesses for Tanenbaum at $20,000,000 . Ford was not known to be the purchaser at the time . In making the purchase , a stipulation was made that the stockholder should , with his stock , turn over his proxy in favor of the lease . which would have put th4 property in the hands of the Ford ' family company , which was to be organized and known as the Detroit &; Ironton Railroad Company . The officers of the company arranged the lease on these terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City to enjoin this action by the- officers , who include Otto T. Bonnard , William Church Osborn , Herbert M. Morse , Sydney . C. Berg , Frederick H. Ecker , Frederick Osborn and Boyd C. Curts . The purpose of this suit , however , is accomplished by the action this week of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the New York State action will'not be - pressed until the automobile manufacturer seeks in some new manner to eliminate his small-scale colleagues . In his brief to the Supreme Court in this State , Mr. SI , rouse offered the following analysis of die motives of the automobile Maker : There is but one explanation of the insistence of a man of Mr. Ford 's undoubted genius in wishing to carry out this scheme . Past unpleasant experiences with business associates evidently implanted in the.mind of a man of fixed ideas a detemination that he would not be hampered by a quasi-partnership relation in his new undertaking . The proposed lease accomplishes that object and nothing- else justifier ! , or explains it . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
