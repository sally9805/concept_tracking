The Bolsheviki continue to export grain . Four million bushels await shipment on the Black Sea ; another 1,200,000 bushels at Petrograd . Tho struggle between the peasants and the government has brought about the lamentable policy of exporting wheat while the people starve . <P> The peasants , having known years in which they did not have enough grain to sow their fields in the spring , want to hoard whatever grain they can . The Bolsheviki , having failed to get this grain by persuasion , are reported to be trying to starve the people out . The Reds argue that the country is in need of credits , and that if the peasants yielded their grain the same amounts as at present could be shipped with less disastrous results to the country . This is a typical Soviet attitude . Meanwhile , the world waits to learn how the Russian government will spend what credits it is now obtaining at the price of starvation .
