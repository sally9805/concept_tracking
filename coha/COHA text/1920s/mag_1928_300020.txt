If a public servant , for a bribe or whatever , permits the violation of a law , he is Corrupt . <P> Is a private citizen Corrupt who , by bribery or otherwise , tries to make or save money by breaking or evading the law ? <P> The U , S. customs and Prohibition laws are probably the ones most commonly broken by the general run of U. S. citizens . Two incidents last week , though involving no evidence of attempted bribery , set citizens wondering about Corruption among private citizens . <P> Ziegfeld 's Folly . Across the U. S. boundary line at Rouse 's Point , N. Y. , came a train of which one unit was the " Roamer , " private car of Jacob Leonard Replogle , New York Steelman . Mr. and Mrs. Replogle were aboard and so were Dr. Jerome Wagner of Manhattan , a brother of U S. Senator Robert Wagner of New York , and Florenz Ziegfeld , famed girl-glorifier , producer of the perennial Follies . They had been visiting at the Wagner camp near Quebec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ziegfeld and Wagner had not arisen for the day . Neither had the Replogles . When the Customs inspector came through , Mr. Ziegfeld said yes , he had no alcoholics . The Replogles said no , they had none either . Dr. Wagner , however , spoke up and admitted he had some whiskey left in a bottle . The " Roamer 's " porter confessed he had a bottle of beer . <P> The inspector frowned , apologized , searched , discovered : <P> Whiskey ... 50 bottles <P> Brandy ... 54 bottles <P> Ale ... 44 bottles <P> Mr. and Mrs. Replogle denied all knowledge of where it came from . But the " Roamer " was uncoupled and detained at Rouse 's Point until Dr. Wagner and Producer Ziegfeld had been fined $614 . <P> Lawyer Steuer. * In Manhattan , it leaked out that Max D. Steuer had been obliged to pay $5,251.30 in duties and fines for an improper customs declaration which his wife had made out for them jointly . Inspectors had discovered $2,625.65 ( U. S. value ) worth of dresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mrs. Steuer had neglected to mention . <P> It was embarrassing for Mr. Steuer because he already enjoys a fame bordering on notoriety . He is a lawyer . Not brilliant mentally , he excels at courtroom melodramatics of a type which many a jury has found seductive . " The Belasco of the Bar , " he has been called , by persons not trying to compliment Producer David Belasco . <P> Lawyer Steuer hastened to explain that the undeclared goods had all belonged to his wife , not to himself . Then " merely ... to demonstrate that there was no possibility for the Government to be wronged of a cent or that she or I should profit a cent , " Lawyer Steuer made this astonishing statement : <P> " I would like to call attention to the fact that whatever is paid by way of customs duties is deductible from income tax . My income tax for the year 1928 will be ( as it has for many years been and would be if I had no income for the balance of the year ) very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's income tax , separately payable by her upon her income , amounts to many times $900 and a number of times $5,251.
