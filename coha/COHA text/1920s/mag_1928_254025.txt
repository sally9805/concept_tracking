Roy J. Wensley , Westinghouse electric engineer , had an invitation to entertain the National Masonic League Level Club in Manhattan last week with his televox system , wherein tones of certain pitch affect electrified diaphragms , which cause electromagnets to go this way &; that , which make machinery go &; stop . <P> He rigged up a blocky mannikin with swiveled arms and wired innards . Then he , others also , at the Level Club blew whistles of those assorted tones to which the dunderhead had been attuned . It pulled a rope that raised a flag that covered the painted face of George Washington ; it raised a telephone receiver ; it set a vacuum cleaner and electric fan going and the Masonic audience applauding . <P> Electrician Wensley was prompted to forecast : " I can envision the day when possibly a race of 500,000 of these men will be at the beck &; call of humanity . . . . We have already got an order from a gentleman who has a country estate . He wants a robot . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
