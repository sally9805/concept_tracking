THE NEW Ante Lucem THAT our boys and girls are better informed at ten or twelve than our grand-parents were at twenty is proven beyond argument by school taxes and bills . Books , books , books . Dozens of them to each child ! Great-grandfather probably had not more than two or three . Indeed , if his earliest years were passed upon British soil , as was the case with many of our ancestors , it is quite likely he had but one , and a copy of that one lies before me . It came out of a rusty-hinged box containing also a curl of flaxen and one of dark-brown hair laid between folds of yellowed paper , a " sampler , " the rusty needle darned across the letter " q , " the little fingers that left it there having neatly finished the faded capitals above , and a doll with red-cheekecl china head sewed to sawdust-oozing body . Under these things lay the book upon the fly-leaf of which is written the names of Great-grandfather and Great-grandaunt , the latter of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they obtained the education that shrivels to such trifling proportions in the glare of learning flooding the brains of their young descendants of today . The book has 167 pages , the first showing a gentleman with large head and hands , seated in a great chair and lifting a warning finger at a little boy in frilled trousers who stands before him . Beside the gentleman is a desk with feathered pen sticking up in an inkwell , and a huge open book . Behind the little boy other scholars sit , studying deeply . Beneath the picture : Delightful task ! To rear the tender Thought , To teach the young Idea how to shoot , To pour the fresh instruction o'er the Mind , To breathe the enlivening Spirit , and to fix The generous Purpose in the glowing Breast . The gentleman engaged in this delightful task appears to be enjoying himself more than does the little boy whose breast is , or should be , glowing .

Then the Preface : The parts of this Spelling-book of peculiar importance which should be committed to memory before the Child December 22 , 1920 THE NEW Great-grandfather and Great-grandaunt , not being accustomed to the strain of twentieth century , Studies , may have felt a little tired after their daily ' set-to with even a part of these eight pages , and perhaps were glad to spend an hour upon the Definitions of the Arts and Sciences peculiarly important for them to know before they were ten years ' old . When Great-grandfather was asked : " What is Geometry ? " he answered : This sublime science teaches the relations of magnitude , and the properties of surfaces . In an extended sense it is the science of demonstration . It includes the greater part of mathematics , and is generally preferred to logic in teaching the art of reasoning . When Great-grandaunt was asked : " What is Biography ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may be called the science of life and manners . It teaches front experience and is therefore most useful to youth . See THE BRITISH NEPOS and Abridged Plutarch . Then , if it should be inquired of Great-grandfather : " What is Criticism ? " he would say : Criticism is an Art which teaches us to write with Propriety and taste , but greatly abused by writers of anonymous reviews , who make a trade of it and sell their opinion . Suspicion whispers that some anonymous critic ' 11,2y have said unkind things about The British Nepos , or possibly about Dr. Mayor 's verse . He evidently knows all about that , because a question Great-grandaunt had to manage , if it came in her turn , was : " What is Poetry ? " the answer to that old riddle being : Poetry is a speaking picture , representing real or fictitious events by a succession- of mental imagery , generally delivered in measured numbers . It at once refines the heart and elevates the soul . 13r . Mayor , of course , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had defined ' Cosmography , Anatomy , Ethics , Logic , o LPtics , Religion , Law , and other little things like , , " 4at , they spent some time upon Countries and their ' aPitals , the Multiplication Table , the Parts of Speech Short Rules for Speaking and Writing Grammatically , the Stops and Marks , and some f v ? reign words and phrases enabling them to con-:4e with greater elegance than if confined to the English language alone . It must have sounded batter for Great-grandfather to say to Greatgrand-alInt : " I admire your sang froid , " rather than " I e Your nerve ! " And if Great-grandaunt said to ' ' teat-grandfather : " Your behavior is somewhat he must have been less put out than had she exclaimed : " You clumsy thing ! " The next mental exercise of Great-grandfather and Great-grandaunt was the Church Catechism , the two Short Catechisms ( one having twenty-six and the other thirty-seven questions ) of Dr. Watts , and the Social Catechism of Mr. Barrow : This gentleman had written many books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only his Social Catechism was of such peculiar importance that it must be learned before the Young Christian was ten years old . Among thirty questions here are a few : Q. What is the King ? ( Kings of 1920 please note the answer ) . A. The supreme power entrusted with the execution of the laws , the fountain of honor and mercy , the head of the church , and the director of the naval and military forces of the empire . Q. What are the chief objects of the laws ? A. The prevention of crimes by punishment for the example of others , such as death , transportation , imprisonment , whipping and pillory . Q. What are the means of avoiding offences ? A. Constantly to avoid temptation ; to shun bad or loose company ; never to spend more than your income ; never to do what your conscience tells you is wrong ; always to remember that you are in the presence of God who will punish you hereafter if you escape the punishment of the laws of this world . Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The experience of all wicked men that a life of crime is a life of trouble , torment and misery ; their frequent declarations that they would give the world itself to be restored to innocency and virtue ; also the known fact that content , health , cheerfulness and happiness attend a good conscience and an honest and virtuous life . If Great-grandfather and Great-grandaunt followed Mr. Barrow 's advice they were assuredly pretty safe , but to clinch the matter they had to memorize before they were ten years old five pages of such " Moral Observations " as these : ? Complaisance renders a superior amiable , an equal agreeable , and an inferior acceptable . A wise man will desire no more than he may get justly , use soberly , distribute cheerfully and live contentedly . Some men miss the prize of prosperity by procrastination ; others by impatience and precipitancy . Anger may glance into the breast of a wise man , but it rests only in the bosom of fools . This last- suggests a warning to the Young Christian against harboring any bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for business life he had to assimilate before his tenth year the advice of Benjamin Franklin to " young persons intended for trade . " For example : Beware of thinking all your own that you possess and 104 of living accordingly . Keep an exact account of your expenses and your income . If you take the pains to enumerate particulars you will discover how wonderfully small expenses mount up to large sums , and will discern what might have been saved without occasioning any great inconvenience . The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market . Waste neither time nor money , but make the best use of both . Even to the hard-pressed school-boys and girls of today a Survey of the Universe might seem a rather large order to " intermix with other studies , " but Dr. Mayor required it of his pupils , and Great-grandfather and Great-grandaunt learned that : Everything in the Universe is systematical ; all is combination , affinity and connexion . Also they had to know a good deal about the System in which the Earth moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and importance . How , December 22 , 1920 ever , they were allowed to take a certain amount for granted , for Dr. Mayor says : From what we know of our own system it may be reasonably concluded that all the rest are with equal wisdom contrived , situated , and provided with accommu ' dations for rational inhabitants . Let us , therefore , take a survey of the System to which we belong , the only one accessible to us , and thence we shall be the better enabled to judge of the nature of the other systems of ; - the universe . It is perhaps fortunate that other solar systems were not accessible to Dr. Mayor , and that Great . grandfather and Great-grandaunt were not asked to make a survey extending farther than our own before they were ten years old , because , not being used to protracted mental effort as are our chili dren , they might have become tired and discOur ? aged while still quite young and never have reached           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
