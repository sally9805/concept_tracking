A Book of New Aspects <P> Some Adventures in Nudity The Story . John Webster , small-town manufacturer of second-rate washing-machines , falls in love with his stenographer and runs away with her . He leaves behind him a bovine , 17-year-old daughter and a stodgy wife , who immediately poisons herself . He has an unaccountable tendency to take off his clothes , with or without provocation . He introduces the subject of his prospective elopement by parading up and down his room , characteristically naked , before a picture of the Virgin , until his wife and daughter come in , find him , and think him crazy . He is inclined to agree with them . So is the reader . <P> The Significance . With this aggressively commonplace plot and in a style painstakingly simple , Mr. Anderson attempts the well-nigh impossible . His object is to show , through John Webster 's experience , the mystery and miracle of the commonplace seen with the vision of inspiration . John Webster 's love gives the world new aspects . The fronts of houses seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of the people in them . Every episode , every object , takes on for him a fresh beauty . He tries to give some of this sudden light to his wife and daughter . To the former he tries to <P> recall the one moment of perfect beauty between them , when he met <P> ( both of them , of course , naked ) for the first time . But they had both ruined that moment by hypocrisy and shame , and the life in her soul had been killed . With the daughter he is slightly more successful . She begins to see the vision , with him , of a world transformed by love , divested of sham , in which everyone sees behind the cloak of the actual to the reality of the spirit , and in which minds commerce freely with each other . That is what he meant by love-a marriage of the spirit , in which one individual for a long or short period , saw deeply into the inner life of the other . <P> The appeal of the book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be about equally dull , confusing , ridiculous , and shocking . It is a book compounded in equal parts of the most painfully literal and the most elusively symbolic . The combination is a shade trying . And there is an irritating lack of humor . It is hard to sympathize with anyone who takes himself as seriously as do both Mr. Anderson and his hero . It is altogether too easy to allow one 's sense of the ab- surdity of a good many of its episodes to cloud one 's perception of the beauty underlying them . It is hard to read it through with a straight face . The Critics . Many Marriages appeared first in The Dial It was hailed by the extremely advanced as another of the yearly crop of " great American novels . " Since its publication in book form its reception has been uneven . It is an easy book to rave over and an even easier one at which to laugh . A few of the unintelligently prurient have been shocked by its plain speaking . F. P. A. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So were Burton Rascoe , of The New York Tribune , and Edmund Wilson , Jr. , of The Dial . Dr. Henry Seidel Canby , of The Literary Review , regards it as " a new Pilgrim 's Progress . " His praise is not quite unqualified , but he says of Mr. Anderson : " If we are to have an American Hardy , he is the man . "
