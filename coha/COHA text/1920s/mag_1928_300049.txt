As the days and nights grow cooler in September , the gridiron absorbs the warmth of the waning sun . Rumors begin to sizzle , fat to drip off portly full-backs capering with pigskins . <P> The last teams to begin practice are those representing Yale , Harvard and Princeton . Even these had begun to grunt and exercise last week . While speculation as to which would be most imposing later in the season is properly confined to barrooms in college clubs and the writings of Grantland Rice , alert prognosticators fixed their attention upon the coaches . Of these , the most interesting is Marvin Allen ( " Mai " ) Stevens who has replaced famed " Tad " Jones of Yale . Brown , lithe and shy . " Mai " Stevens played for Yale in 1923 on famed " Memphis Bill " Mallory 's undefeated team ; before that he had played for Washburn college , in Kansas . In his senior year at Yale he was ineligible ; later , he was wont to divide his time between medical school and backfield coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year he is the youngest of the important coaches and , since in football the cart goes before the horse , not the least likely to draw his team to November triumphs . <P> As usual , there is a pother about the new-rules and an argument as to how they shall be interpreted . <P> These are , in the last analysis , of small consequences and too intricate to explain without generally unintelligible technicalities . A far more important consideration is the continued and preposterous refusal of Athletic Associations at Yale , Harvard , Princeton and certain other colleges to provide proper facilities for unfortunate newspaper reporters who are compelled to sit on top of the windy stadiums , fumbling telegraph instruments with frozen thumbs .
