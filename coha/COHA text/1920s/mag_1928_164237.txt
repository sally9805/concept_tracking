The Geisha girls of Japan , skilful with the lute and larynx , forming the apex of Japan 's musical culture , were infuriated two weeks ago ( TIME , July 16 ) when they were compared by a committee of 14 moralists to the rude night-club entertainers of Manhattan . Japanese Geisha girls count U. S. music a noisy nonsense and even the finest of U. S. singers their inferiors by far . What last week was their horror to learn that one of the night-club entertainers who had been compared to them was not only their artistic inferior but a member of the lowest class of civilized creatures , a common bargee , the U. S. counterpart of those yellow specimens who live on rafts and junks in the rivers of inferior China . Their annoyance was not unnatural ; yet , had they known the true facts concerning the bargee- " Geisha-girl " their annoyance would have vanished and , since Geisha girls are intelligent , they would have been full of sympathy . <P> The bargee in question was one Isobel Stone , 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister , Margaret Stone ( Mrs. Richard O'Neill ) , living rent free upon a wretched scow near the slums of Manhattan . She was not a bargee by birth ; her father indeed was the late William A. Stone , onetime ( 1899-1903 ) Governor of Pennsylvania , defender of famed Harry K. Thaw . A millionaire and a man of fashion , called " Pennsylvania 's greatest Governor , " he had died in 1920 , his large fortune dissipated in unfortunate speculations . Isobel Stone with her sister Margaret was compelled to earn a living . This she did , being of artistic inclination and equipped with some vocal talent , by singing . After making her debut with Aphrodite in Manhattan , she joined the San Carlo Opera Company , with which she sang Siebel in Faust . Later she became the understudy for more noteworthy performers ; of late , a chorus girl , a hanger on at rehearsal halls and an ofttime entertainer or hostess at night clubs , Isobel Stone was compelled to relinquish the idea of a rent-paying existence . Luckily one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she was discovered last week in a state of great and irritable depression which she expressed in this fashion : <P> " Our relatives sometimes ask us to lunch at the Ritz when they come to New York , but that 's really little help when you 're starving and ca n't pay your rent . <P> " It 's not pleasant , especially when you come home late at night in high-heeled shoes and an evening gown , and it 's raining , and you have to row yourself to your house in a dinghy that is half full of water . <P> " We have many rich relatives , but they have no money for their poor relatives . <P> " Of late I have been reduced to singing at some of the night clubs which I detest . <P> " Few people realize how difficult it is for a young woman to win her way , her living , on Broadway , even when she is gifted artistically . Broadway , whether in opera or musical comedy , and I have sung in both , is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . . . . "
