St. George was the Patron Saint of England , St. Andrew of Scotland and everyone knows about St. Patrick . When a flag for the United Kingdom was desired the three crosses peculiar to the three saints were ingeniously superimposed , forming the famed British " Union Jack . " Last week this same tried and tested formula of superimposition was carried to its ultimate conclusion with the unfurling of a new flag for that British Dominion called the Union of South Africa . <P> At Johannesburg and Cape Town , riots by native blacks accompanied the unfurling of the new flag . Misguided agents of the extreme pro-British faction , who wish to continue under the " Union Jack , " had still further misguided the Afric blacks into believing the absurd bit of blather that the new flag would mean their enslavement . Fired by this preposterous notion , the natives massed and howled protests against what they called the " coffin flag . " Shouting " Away with Slavery ! " they tore down the new banner in numerous instances . Meanwhile 100% British Islanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack and shouting : " We were born under this flag and we want no other ! " <P> Amid so much furor , few South Africans had time to dissect and rationalize their new flag . Basically it is a horizontal tricolor , reading from top to bottom orange , white and blue . In the centre of the white stripe is superimposed the old Orange Free State flag , hanging vertically . Adjoining , on the white , is the Union Jack , spread toward the flagstaff . Lastly the old Transvaal vierkleur is superimposed upon the white , spreading away from the staff . Thus the new flag , which might be called the " Union Union Jack " is one big tricolor with three little flags stitched in a row on the centre of its centre stripe.
