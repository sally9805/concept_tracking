Vanderbilt donations to public institutions have been frequent , moderate , unostentatious through the generations , in regard to some organizations practically a tradition . Thus in 1884 William Henry , second in line , gave $500,000 to found the school of medicine in connection with the College of Physicians and Surgeons ( now part of Columbia University ) . Two years later ( he died in 1885 ) his four boys , Cornelius II , William Kissam , Frederick William and George W. , learned that that medical school needed a clinic and supplied money for the Vanderbilt Clinic . Now , after 40 years of training medical students and treating millions of patients , the clinic 's facilities have become somewhat obsolete , inconveniently located . So Frederick William ( William Henry 's only living son ) and his nephew , Harold Stirling ( son of William Kissam ) , together gave $500,000 for a new Vanderbilt Clinic for Columbia 's developing medical centre .
