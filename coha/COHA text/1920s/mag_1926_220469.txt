Finance Minister Caillaux returned to Paris , from London last week a fiscal conqueror . The Franco - British debt settlement ( TIME , July 19 ) , which he had negotiated with Chancellor Churchill was supplemented by attached correspondence providing that should France ever fail* to receive less than 50% of the contemplated German reparations payments , Britain will consent to a renegotiation of the entire Franco-British debt . <P> Simultaneously M. Caillaux received from Washington assurances that the U. S. will not , in the event of ratification of the Franco-U . S. debt accord , throw any bonds received in payment on the security markets of the world , a possibility under Article VII of the agreement . French fear that Germans might eventually acquire these bonds , thus putting France under a sort of fiscal vassalage to her worst enemies , was thereby allayed . Since this particular " emotional factor " had loomed like a boojum , and threatened to rouse Frenchmen unalterably against ratification , to eliminate it was of paramount import . <P> Premier Briand and his Finance Minister were emboldened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation by the unabated fall of the franc . <P> The moment seemed ripe for attempting to jam through the Chamber M. Caillaux 's program ( TIME , July 19 ) , whereby the Chamber should confer dictatorial power upon the Cabinet for four months to save the franc . M. Caillaux announced that the Cabinet intended to employ this power to make binding once and for all the Franco-U . S. and Franco-British debt agreements , " as is , " and without further dickering . <P> The stroke was bold and probably judicious . For months the rival factions in the Chamber have played party politics while the franc fell-have displayed the acumen of drunkards gambling in a burning saloon . Not to stake all upon forcing some definite program to an issue , was to court more months of mad trifling while the franc collapsed . Moreover a precedent had been established for **28;6775;TOOLONG only a few days before , when the Belgian Parliament buried its party differences , and all but unanimously conferred dictatorial power upon King Albert ( See BELGIUM ) . <P> The temperature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier Herriot , president of the Chamber , leader of the Coalition of Left Parties , a man of such lofty principles that his last Ministry was overthrown ( TIME , April 20 , 1925 ) , when it was discovered that he had countenanced tampering with the books of the Bank of France , arose , not to urge any program of his own to save the franc , but solely to upset his rival , M. Briand , and enemy , M. Caillaux , whose notorious reputation has made him suspect of many Frenchmen ( TIME , July 5 ) . <P> Finally Premier Briand called a spade a shovel : " M. Herriot , listen to me . I do not know what will be the outcome of this duel between us . ... " <P> M. Herriot : " It is not a duel ! I will shake your hand ! " <P> M. Briand : " ' We must have the courage to call things by their names . There is a duel between the president of the Chamber and the president of the Council ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment is tragic beyond words . ... "
