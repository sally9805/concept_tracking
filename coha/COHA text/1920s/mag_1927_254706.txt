After months of raging , there was satisfaction last week at Oberammergau , home of the famed Passion Players . Anton Lang , able Christus , had written a letter denouncing his nephew Otto Lang for apostasy from Catholicism to Methodism . America , U. S. Catholic weekly , printed the letter : " . . . Never before was it known that any child of Oberammergau did such a thing in America as to leave the Catholic Church . For his passing over into the Methodist Church neither his relatives nor Oberammergau can be held responsible . Acting as a good Catholic , my son Anton , who at present is studying at Holy Cross College , in Worcester , Massachusetts see p. 18 , has already in various papers taken a stand against this Propaganda - Methodism . In fact Otto Lang has complained to me about it Anton II 's cousinly denunciation . "
