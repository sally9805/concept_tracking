In most states the adjournment of the legislature is an incident of interest only to the politically-minded . In Arkansas a fortnight ago it was a capital event , at least to the Haley Potato Chip Co. , whose manager placed in the Little Rock Arkansas Gazette this advertisement : <P> WHOOPEE ! HURRAH ! The legislature has adjourned ! Let 's all close up and celebrate ! At one o'clock this afternoon I shall close my potato chip establishment . I shall hang out my American flags and as they kiss again the air of freedom unpolluted by the foul breath of the legislative bribe takers , the boodlers , the demagogues and the little dictators so drunk with power that they even dare to shout infamously , " To hell with the constitution , " I shall retire to the solitude of my home and I shall kneel before the pictures of George Washington , the founder of our Republic , Abraham Lincoln , the saviour of our Country , and Woodrow Wilson , who died a martyr to the ideal of making the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank the " author of liberty " that the Arkansas legislative monstrosity has at last expired . I shall pray devoutly that a blessing may come from the travesty of justice . That the eyes of the people may be opened and that so help us God we will exercise more wisely the God-given right of the ballot . The cessation of unprincipled work of the legislature marks the greatest day for Arkansas since the Armistice.
