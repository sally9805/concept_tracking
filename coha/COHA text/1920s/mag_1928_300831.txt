To Albany , in the last week before Notification , went the Democracy 's champion Drys-Glass from Virginia , Daniels from North Carolina , George from Georgia , Walsh from Montana . Would they , could they , induce the Nominee not to insist again , in his acceptance speech , upon modification of Prohibition ? <P> When Nominee Smith released his speech , it was to the Prohibition section that citizens paid prime attention . This was it : <P> Prohibition : " The President of the United States has two constitutional duties with respect to prohibition . The first is embodied in his oath of office . If , with one hand on the Bible and the other hand reaching up to Heaven , I promise the people of this country that ' I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and to the best of my ability preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States , you may be sure that I shall live up to that oath to the last degree . . . . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best to execute them whether he likes them or not . The corruption in enforcement activities which caused a former Republican Prohibition Administrator to state that three-fourths of the dry agents were political ward heelers named by politicians without regard to Civil Service laws and that prohibition is the ' new political pork barrel , ' I will ruthlessly stamp out . Such conditions can not and will not exist under any administration presided over by me . <P> " The second constitutional duty imposed upon the President is ' to recommend to the Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . ' Opinion upon prohibition cuts squarely across the two great political parties . There are thousands of so-called ' wets and drys ' in each . The platform of my party is silent upon any question of change in the law . I personally believe that there should be change and I shall advise the Congress in accordance with my constitutional duty of whatever changes I deem ' necessary or expedient . ' It will then be for the people and the representatives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made . <P> " I believe in temperance . . . . The mothers and fathers of young men and women throughout this land know the anxiety and worry which has been brought to them by their children 's use of liquor in a way which was unknown before prohibition . I believe in reverence for law . Today disregard of the prohibition laws is insidiously sapping respect for all law . I raise , therefore , what I profoundly believe to be a great moral issue involving the righteousness of our national conduct and the protection of our children 's morals . <P> " Some immediate relief would come from an amendment to the Volstead Law giving a scientific definition of the alcoholic content of an intoxicating beverage . . . . Each State would then be allowed to fix its own standard of alcoholic content , subject always to the proviso that that standard could not exceed the maximum fixed by the Congress .
