For once in the campaign the opposing Nominees were in the same state at the same moment . The day after Nominee Smith reached Albany he turned his back on politics and went out for a restful game of golf . That same evening , amid the booming of flashlights and headlines , Nominee Hoover arrived in Manhattan . In the Hoover pocket was a speech , probably the most earnestly composed document of his campaign . <P> Before Nominee Hoover , read his speech , into the klieglight stepped a thinnish , baldish , nasal gentleman in a big collar , whose reticence and invisibility had been notable if not conspicuous up to that point in the campaign . Ever since the nominations at Kansas City , Vice President Charles Gates Dawes had been a neutral factor in the election which he had once hoped would be won by his friend , Frank Orren Lowden , and in which he would gladly have played a principal part himself . The plan to introduce him as preliminary speaker in Nominee Hoover 's big drive for the Brown Derby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Vice President Dawes , ever brisk , had written a smart speech . He had written briefly what he had to say , written briefly what the Hooverizers had been trying to say for four months . Something happened to his delivery , however , and the huge audience missed his sharpness as he said : " The real and overshadowing issue . . . is the maintenance of prosperity . <P> " . . . The maintenance of prosperity depends on maintenance of general confidence . . . . <P> " A change in Administration means confusion and change . . . , the passing of confidence . " <P> He called the Prohibition issue " a sentimental referendum . " He said Democratic tariff proposals could only result in " some oblique movement . . . and destroy prosperity . " He was talking to and about " the average vote . ' ' " The average voter senses this . . . and it will be the average voter who determines the result of the election . " <P> Following this prelude , Nominee Hoover stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm . The Nominee was unable to do anything about it . He flapped his fingers a few times , and tried to smile . <P> After 20 minutes , Demos sat down . It was then that Nominee Hoover made his first , direct reference to Nominee Smith . Said he : " no man could fail to be moved by the reception I have received in the home town of my distinguished opponent . " Nominee Hoover announced that he would ignore " the multitude of issues which have already been well canvassed " and discuss home " fundamental principles and ideals . " He plunged into a series of generalities such as " the march of progress , " " great constructive measures , " and " an economic and social system , vastly more intricate and delicately adjusted than ever before " ( one of his most frequent phrases ) . He spoke also of attempts " to inject the Government into business in competition with its citizens . " And he spoke of " the American system . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
