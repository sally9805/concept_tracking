Some one-some wit-better endowed with sharpness than with taste , composed a little rhyme : <P> Who , who , who remembers ? <P> Harding 's Cabinet had ten members : <P> Poor old Denby had to resign , <P> Then there were nine ; <P> Such was Harry Daugherty 's fate , <P> Then there were eight ; <P> H. C. Wallace went to Heaven , <P> Then there were seven ; <P> Hughes was next to quit the mix , <P> Now there are six ; <P> All the rest are going strong- <P> How long ? <P> The history of the rhyme is accurate enough . Weeks , Mellon , New , Work , Hoover , Davis remain . Wilbur , whom President Coolidge added to the group as Secretary of the Navy , likewise is at hand . Last week , the President announced that " except for unforeseen emergencies " in the Cabinet , no further changes would be made . The announcement came after the previous two weeks had wrought major changes that mean a new Cabinet in several respects after Mar. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by portfolios , with the prospects that each has roused : <P> State . Secretary Hughes ' resignation , and the announcement of Ambassador Kellogg 's appointment ( TIME , Jan. 19 ) remained the object of much comment . Here is a collection of reasons assigned for Mr. Hughes ' resignation : <P> 1 ) That he desires to retire from public life after 20 years of service , with the implied corollary that he will build up his personal fortune , too long neglected , by returning to his lucrative law practice . ( The official reason . ) <P> 2 ) That the presence of Senator Borah , with whom Mr. Hughes differs on policies , at the head of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate meant lack of team work and Mr. Hughes preferred to resign . ( Probably a contributory reason . ) <P> 3 ) That Mr. Hughes desired to undertake a policy of more active participation in international affairs , which policy the President opposed . ( Secret explanation of the " real reason . " ) <P> 4 ) That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , which policy Mr. Hughes opposed . ( Another secret explanation of the " real reason . " ) <P> 5 ) That Mr. Hughes wishes to be a candidate for President in 1928 and looks forward to strengthening his position by leaving the Cabinet . ( Still another secret explanation of the " real reason . " ) <P> It is impossible to say how , if in any way , Mr. Kellogg 's foreign policy will differ from Mr. Hughes . ' The President announced that there was no prospect of a change in policy . It was suggested that Mr. Kellogg 's appointment is but temporary . This suggestion was made largely because of a general impression that Mr. Kellogg is not very able , that he is an indecisive , worrying , nervous little man , a capable lawyer but without much driving force . Mark Sullivan , one of the aldest of political observers , was inclined to discount this impression of the Secretary of State-to-be , declaring that the impression of timidity comes mainly from physical fidgetiness , that no one , saving only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and gave battle so boldly to Senator LaFollette as little " Nervous Nellie " Kellogg . <P> But if Mr. Kellogg is to be Secretary of State temporarily , who will come after ? <P> War . No rumors were abroad concerning Secretary Weeks .
