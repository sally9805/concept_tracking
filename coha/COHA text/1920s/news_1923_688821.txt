txt Palestine has 765,000 population now under English mandate as compared with Syria 's 3,000,000 under French mandate . There arc fewer than 100,000 people in Jerusalem . Ten years ago there were 70,000 . But when General Allenby entered the town in 1317 there were only 50,000 . But the refugees have all returned and more . A large majority now , as 10 years ago , are Jews anti Jerusalem likewise holds a majority of the Jews in Palestine . Were it not for the Jewish Throbrem , the English with their base in Egypt , railway system in Palestine and French barrier between them and the Turk on the north would have an easy problem . SHALL THE SEWS NATIONALIZE PALESTINE ! But the whole world has been stirred up over'the proposal " for the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people .

" The Crane Commission has recently reported against it . Samuel Untcrmyer , head of the Palestine movement in America , has denounced the Crane report and declared that the proposal is orgy for the establishment of a home for the Jewish-people in Palestine , thus refuting President H ardi ng 's declaration . The Moslem world has been stirred by the proposal , and Turk and Arab are raising questions and rifles over the issue . It would be difficult to explain , when the Jews have now a home in every nation of the world , including Russia , how they are to have a real home and a real Jewish na , tionality in Palestine without a Jewish flag flying over Jerusalem .

The facts of population and possession seem to be the bar to " a real Jewish nationality . " WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THE JEWS ? The Moslem has had task enough to keep the .

The followers of Islam get along very well with the English when there is no interference from the outside . But will the Moslem world accept a Jewish mandate in place of an English mandate over their corefigionists in Palestine ? The Turk is a fighter , and the Jew is not . Is the socalled Christian world ready to fight Islam to restore Jewish nationality in Palestine ? THE PALESTINE JEWS Many thousands of Jews have been settled in agricultural colonies in Palestine . These colonies were planted some years back by the beneficence of Montefiore and the Rothschllds . Where'located they have made tho hillsides and the valleys to blossom with their orchards and vineyards . Their clustered buildings give an appearance of prosperity and their almond trees and orange groves indicate thrift . The Australian blue gum tree , known in the United States as the eucalyptus , has been planted through Palestine in lowlands to dry up the soil and on farmlands to yield timber .

The Turks say , " Let them conic in and cultivate and make the fields and ' gardens and then we will take them . " ? The Jews over the world have poured millions of dollars into Jerusalem , yet some people here declare that the city has no economic basis for existence . It is a desert north and west and east to the Jordan and the Dead Sea . To the south toward Bethlehem there are terraces , almond trees anti artificial . fertility . Bethlehem is comparatively prosperous as the center for agriculture and trading with the Bedouins . Jerusalem has so many new houses , hospitals and schools and so many , new red roofs outside the walls of the city and on the hillsides as to give the appearance of a comparatively new and growing town .

The shell holes still exist in the desert whore the bombs were thrown from the sea to explode the Turk 's scattered dumps of ammunit ion . THE ' MILKS The gameness of the Turk as he fought superior numbers and weapons on the desert is admired by the English . Indeed the fighting qualities of the Turk arc nowhere more respected than in English military circles . The Turks never poisoned a well and in retreat would label the water holes that were infected as unfit for use . They were as humanitarian in the Palestine war as they were at Gallipoli , where when retreating they . left buckets of water for the enemy labeled " for your wounded .

The English armored lorries still go thundering over it as they move men and supplies from Haifa by Nazareth and Tiberias . The eastern side of Tiberias , or the beautiful Sea of Galilee ns students know it , is still the bad land of the bad Bedouin . PALESTINE FINANCE When the English entered Palestine , strange to relate , they found ? 060,000 in bank for the account of the national treasury . There are some things that seem rather square about what Gladstone denounced as the unspeakable Turk . It is said in both Palestine and Syria that there were points of excellence about the rule and administration of the Turk , although countries under him never seemed to thrive or develop .

The Mohammedan tariff of 11% has just been advanced in many lines . Whiskey has been put up to 15% and ordinary wines to 20% and the tax on imported sweets has also been increased to 20% , perhaps in recognition of the fact that alcohol and sugar are twin brothers in the economy of the human system .
