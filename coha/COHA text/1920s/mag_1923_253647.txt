There were no divots or sliced tee shots when England and America found themselves bunkered on the first hole of a long struggle at Boston in 1775 . The British approach fell short , if memory serves ; General Gage picked up and returned to Boston . That was nearly 150 years ago . One hundred and thirty-one years later the British again suffered a defeat , this time at the hands of Walter J. Travis , when , at Sandwich , he sailed away with the British Amateur Golf Cup . From that day to this British Golf has rolled America in the dust of British bunkers . <P> On May 7 , eleven American golfers will start shooting for the greens at Deal in the British Amateur championship . Their names : Jesse Sweetser , Francis Ouimet , Bob Gardner " , Dave Herron , Max Marston , Fred J. Wright , Harrison Johnson , Jack Neville , Dr. O. F. Willing , George Rotan and Guy M. Sandifer . On the list are four American Amateur champions . With the exceptions of " Chick " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American amateur golf is bound for Deal . Later in May the group will pick eight men to play a British eight at St. Andrews for the Walker Cup . <P> As good , or better , teams than this have sailed away in quest of the British cup since Travis won it in 1904 . Closest to success came Bob Gardner in his 37 hole battle with Cyril Tolley in the finals at Muirfield in 1920 . Tolley won .
