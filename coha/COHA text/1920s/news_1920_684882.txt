txt In 1910 , the firm of A &; B became insolvent , with liabilities $4,000,000 , and a receiver was appointed who conducted the business until 1912 , when it was taken over by the creditors . Two new corporations were formed , an operating company , the A company , with capital stock of $4,000,000 , which was all held by the B company , a holding company , which in turn issued its bonds to the extent of $2,000,000 , and stock to the extent $2,000,000 to the creditors , each creditor of A &; B receiving half bonds and half stock for his claim .. The reason for this double organization was the desire to issue to the creditors some form of interest bearing obligation , without , however , hampering the operation of the business through restriction of its bank credit . which would have resulted had interest bearing securitisc been issued , the holders of which would have taken prior claim on the assets over other creditors . The B company now has an opportunity to sell its holdings of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the original creditors out without loss . The question arises , however , whether the B company would bn taxable on the difference in value of its holdings of the stock of A company on March 1 , 1913 , and the date of the sale. ? L. M. G. Answer  --  Co . B as a legal entity is liable for tax on profit realized by sale of the A Co. stock at a higher price than it could have obtained on March 1 , 1912 . The fact that it was organized to salvage a bankrupt firm does not . in our opinion differentiate it from any other corporation organized for profit . The creditors accepted its stock and bonds in settlement of their claims . Anything they get row over and above what they could have cashed in for on March 1 . 1913 , is income . If a creditor held $10.000 bonds and $10,000 stock of the B Co. on March 1 . 1313 , and had sold his $10.000 of stock for 55.000 and his bonds for $8,000 , his claims es a creditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new bondholder and the new stockholder , if they now sell their holdings for par . have made a profit . The old creditor , if he did not sell . stands in exactly the same relation . The B Co. is his asset . If it sells its A Cc. stock for more than the fair value as of March 1 . 1912 , it must par a tax before it can liquidate . On liquidation , the stock and bondholders pay a tax on the excess of cash received over the value of their holdings in B Co. on March 1 . 1912 . They have made recovery on a had debt which they had written down to a figure equal to the worth of the securities they held on March 1 , 1913.
