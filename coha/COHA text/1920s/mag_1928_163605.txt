Edwin L. James is a more than potent correspondent . From his sunny , second floor office on the Rue de la Paix he directs the Paris bureau of the New York Times . He is pungent , direct , slangy-and yet he loves nice things . For example he has a penchant for sheer shirts of purest silk embroidered : " E. L. J. " Recently stocky dynamic Correspondent James threw his shirts together in Paris and set out for Rome . <P> Even a great Correspondent must begin by taking his bearings . Therefore the first column and a half cabled by Mr. James was a bright , bedtimish story about Italia Bella , no longer famed lioness with which Il Duce was once wont to pose and gambol publicly ( TIME , Dec. 27 , 1926 ) . Moral of the tale : Signer Mussolini is now so unshakably in power that he no longer needs to bolster up the legend of his invincibility by posing in a lion 's cage . <P> With his bearings firmly taken , Correspondent James proceeded to shed light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XI and Il Duce , as to whether the Church or State shall predominate in educating Italian Youth . Mr. James significantly revealed that in the course of smoothing down this quarrel , Signor Mussolini has agreed that the Fascist Youth organizations shall hereafter receive spiritual training under the auspices of the Church , while all other instruction shall continue lay and Fascist . <P> Naturally the climax of Correspondent James ' dash to Rome came when he was ushered into the enormous , high ceilinged office of Signor Mussolini in the Palazzo Chigi . Soon Il Duce consented to discuss a subject at which most men shy , the prospect of his own death . Said he : " I am here today and gone tomorrow ; but let no one think Fascism goes with me . . . . I do not know how long Mussolini will last , but Fascism shall last longer . ... I will leave to Italy the institution of Fascism established on solid grounds-an historic institution . . . . The youth of Italy shall be trained so that in this country there shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in that place . Let no one waste his time speculating on what will become of Fascism when Mussolini is gone . "
