His voice strained raw , his fists milling , a Negro evangelist towered above his wailing audience in the little Mount Olive ( African Methodist Episcopal ) Zion Church at Waterbury , Conn. , last week . He rose to his toes and menaced the moaning Negroes with all the horrors of hell . Hysterical cries burst from the listeners : " That 's right , preacher ! Go on and preach , man ! Amen , amen ! " <P> In front of the platform was a casket piled with flowers . <P> According to previous newspaper announcements , this was to be the funeral of a certain neighbor . The evangelist chanted no eulogy over the coffin . The dead man had committed every sin , he screamed . He was wicked , he had not been ready when the trump of Gabriel called him to judgment , and therefore he would go to eternal torment . <P> At last , eager to see what this horrible sinner could look like , staggering , moaning , the congregation filed forward . Each man and woman peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom reflected the face of the person who stared . <P> Evangelist W. F. Fisher , who staged the mock funeral , has made a specialty of this sort of thing . Once he saved 50 in one night . At Waterbury only six were saved .
