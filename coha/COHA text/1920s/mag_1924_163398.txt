A sermon was delivered last week which cut across the entire religious geography of the U. S. It pricked consciences , awoke indignation , inspired enthusiasm , and was-fortunately or unfortunately-disturbing . <P> The Pulpit was the plain rostrum of the Smithfield Street M. E. Church of Pittsburgh , where the M. E. Council of Cities was in session . <P> The Preacher was Warren S. Stone , a layman of the Congregational Church , famed President of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. + <P> The Sermon had for its text the fact that Jesus of Nazareth was a poor man , a carpenter , who wore plain clothes , had poor friends , low social rating , belonged to no exclusive clubs . The argument was that the Protestant Churches , whether ritualistic or evangelical , had , to all appearances , forgotten , overlooked , or discarded this fact . Extracts : <P> " You want to know what Labor thinks of the Church ? I tell you very frankly that Labor does not think much of the Church , because the Church does not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Capital and Labor , the influence of the Church has largely been on the side of Capital . This is easily explained when you realize that the Church depends upon Capital for its support and not upon contributions from the workers . Some churches , it is true , carry on a superficial welfare work , but they do almost nothing to interest themselves vitally in wages , working conditions and occupational problems that mean bread and butter and life and death to the worker and his family . <P> " The average worker is convinced that the Church exists largely for the white-collared people . They regard it somewhat as a comfortable social club for merchants and bankers , Rotarians and members of the Chamber of Commerce ... I have a recollection that somewhere in the New Testament it says that when the Carpenter of Nazareth spoke , the common people heard him gladly , while the religious and business classes persecuted and crucified him ... It might be well for you to take a census of your own churches and especially to count the number of men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat of their brows . <P> " The workingman is no longer welcome in many of our Protestant Churches , and the workingman clothed in rags has no place where he is welcome in any of the Protestant Churches . The reverse is true of the Catholic Church . No matter how lowly his position in the social scale , no matter how ragged he may be , the doors of this Church always stand open to him . <P> " The first thing , it seems to me for the Church to do is to live up to its professions . If the ministers were preaching the same sort of gospel and living the same kind of ife today that the great founder of the Christian Church did 2,000 years ago , there would n't be standing room left in any of your churches . " <P> Following President Stone , William E. Sweet , Governor of Colorado said the Church bowed to business and wealth . He renewed the attack on the U. S. Steel Corporation , saying :           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
