Few people are so pathetically ignorant as your well-informed man . The radio has bred this form of mental contagion to an alarming extent in the rural districts . Tom , Tom , the farmer 's son , instead , of leading books on fertilizers , on grafting , on pheasant raising , as more sensible fellows may be doing , spends his evenings listening to talk about the condition of the soap and toothpaste industry , about stocks and bonds , about Florentine painting , about Peter Rabbit . To combat this absurdity the universities of Iowa , of Pittsburgh , and the Kansas State Agricultural College have seen fit to sow the wind with orderly knowledge , sending lectures through the air , giving college credits to those who can pass examinations on what they have heard . Last week these seats of airy learning announced their fall curricula . <P> In Iowa Professors broadcast from WSUI . An enrollment fee of $2 is charged , $4 thereafter per semester hour of final credit granted . Thus a radio student can take , for $60 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $200 to $600 . Last spring one Clifford Liddeen , in absentia in Texas , received his degree . This fall the University offers courses in : Early Iowa History , American Literature , Iowa Flora , English , and Elementary Psychology . <P> In Pittsburgh Chancellor John G. Bowman led off last week with a talk on Spare Moments . Dr. A. G. Worthing explained the Nature of Electricity , or as much of it as he could . Lectures in the offing deal with Radium , X-rays , Structure of the Atom , Relativity-topics which will doubtless supply timely and needed information to the farmers . <P> In Kansas a rural school 's program , though less recondite , is perhaps not less valuable than the programs of Iowa , of Pittsburgh . It begins at nine o'clock in the morning with wake-up exercises , and follows them with a music lesson , nature study , travel , lives of great men , books to read , current events . Five minutes are allotted to an agricultural primer of poultry , crops , dairying , horticulture , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
