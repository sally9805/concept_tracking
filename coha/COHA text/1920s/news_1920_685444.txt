txt At no time since signing of the armistice has the cotton textile trade of Great Britain presented a more interesting study than at malsent , according to U. S. Trade Commissioner Gary in London . While there is a lull in the buying of both yarns and cloth , there is no appreciable fall in prices . Under ordinary conditions absenc'e , of buyers for a few weeks would have meant a slump in prices . The position is one where sellers are not anxious to sell and buyers not over keen to buy . The seller is booked ahead for many months and feels there is no necessity for him to lower his prices . The buyer on the other hand feels that , as he can not obtain delivery of goods within the near future , he should not jeopardize himself by buying for delivery many months in . advance and be caught with high-priced goods on his hands if a slump should - come .

The best informed authorities are of the opinion that this prosperity will last two or three years . A few months back many of the spinners were much perturbed by reports that there would he a shortage of both American and Egyptian cotton . This rumor was confounded with the report that there was a scarcity of better-grade cotton textiles . The opinion is expressed that in view of the iv:4 , reduction in working hours stocks of spinners are satisfactory . Unusually large profits have been - reported by all spinning companies , and amalgamations of such companies continued active until the first of the year . There have been some consolidations reported since that time , but the feverish activity which marked 1919 has subsided . There has been a falling off in exports of yarns to the Continent . This has mainly been due to lack of transport ' and difficulties of exchange .

India has given orders for bundle yarns for long delivery , and China has also booked ' heavily for yarns of this - description . This business has been fairly steady . Spinners have reported an exceptional demand from the United States , especially for the finer counts . Many spinners have sold their production to the end of the year and sonic to the early part of 1921 .

Particular- notice:dile , however , has been the large increase of cloth tshipments to the United States , rising from 11,92 ( 1,100 yards in the first three months of 1913 to 134,520,990 yards for . the corresponding period of 1920 . These shipments have been confined almost entirely to the finer weaves , and the inerea ; - ing sales have been made possible through the low rate of exchange . From the first of this year there has been a fairly good demand for prints and fancies for South America .

Neither does Great Britain see cause for alarm in the report of activity in spinning and weaving companies on the Continent , for the reason that it will take some time for these mills to reach the point where they can produce , and in the meantime they are handicapped by exchange and transportation difficulties in obtaining raw supplies ' . The British industry , however , is concerned about American , and , to a lesser extent , Japanese competition .
