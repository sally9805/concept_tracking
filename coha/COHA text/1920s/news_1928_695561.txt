txt This year will go down not alone as one in which the Texas Corp . enjoyed great improvement in earning power but also as a period in which It projected the largest and most energetic program of expansion since the company 's inception in 1901 . Approximately $70,000,000 is represented in the various steps of expanding the size and scope of the company 's operations , aside from the normal annual reinvestment in various departments . To raise this money Texas Corp . is going to stockholders with an offer of one additional share at $40 for each six held . The 1,408,288 shares so to be issued will bring in $56,331.520 . The sale earlier in the year of 200. - 000 treasury shares at $55.50 a share to the Fisher interests brought in 811.100.000 . Thus , the Texas Corp . is financing its major items of expansion all of which will begin to operate and earn money by next spring . entirely thrc-igh the issuance of common stock . By the two measures outlined , it gets into the treasury 867,431.520 which about balances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion was carried out early in 1928 by acquisition of California Petroleum through exchange of stock . This exchange , two shares of California for one Texas , has resulted in virtually 100,7 : - of California Petroleum being turned in . At the price of Texas Corp . when the exchange was made . this acquisition represented about 860,000.000 for the 1.030,458 Texas Corp . shares needed to make a complete exchange . Last Previous Financing In 1921 While the issue of shares at $40 is to pay for this 192S expansion program , Texas Corp . has a record of reinvesting surplus earnings and reserves over the years to an extent that it could have capitalized this new investment almost at any time . The last financing was through an issue of stock in 1921 raising $21.450,000 . In the six years . 1922 to 1927. inclusive , more than $190. - 000.000 was reinvested 111 properties without raising new money . This was an average of more than 830,000.000 a year , all of which came out of surplus profits and reserves . Contrasted with this six-year average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives an indication of the marked degree in which Texas Corp . management is enlarging the property . On top of that must be added the acquisition of California Petroleum . The whole program is designed to strengthen Texas Corp 's position geographically as well as ' in various oil activities . The result should be an oil unit as fully round- cc3 out as any in the entire industry . All the steps in expansion are of the type and character which supplement or enlarge previous operations The California purchase put Texas Corp . solidly in the Pacific Coast area and made It the only company marketing oil products in every state It beirught various facilities . from production to selling . for aomestic operations and made for a shorter haul of products to Far East markets . Producing operations have been expanded by purchase of the Landreth properties in w est Texas with their production and storage . They are being linked with major refinery at Port Arthur by a 811.000.000 pipe line . Small refineries are being built at three points in Texas and one in Wyoming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically . Production in midcontinent area has been increased and a trunk pipe line will connect Oklahoma properties with the Lockport , Ill , plant and that refinery doubled to 15,000 barrels daily . This will permit the serving of the big Chicago-Great Lakes area with refined oils at a considerable saving in pipe line tariffs . New producing properties in Texas Panhandle are to be served with a trunk line of more than 290 miles which will connect with the old system runnin'r to the Port Arthur works The last important step was the acquisition of certain Galena Signal Oil assets . V. 1th this trade . involving $T. - 500,000 , came considerable inventories , a position in several European and South American markets and a valuable refinery site on the Houston Ship Channel . The latter may be of high value in handling the new crude from west Texas when the pipe line is finished in the next few months . With the Landreth and Galena purchases , Texas Corp obtained steel storage for approximately 8.800,000 barrels located at points where they are of strategic value To dovetail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced campaign of expanding marketing facilities both in this country and abroad . Thus this year may be regarded as one of thoroughly integrating Texas Corp ' s position as well as rounding It Out by expansion to the Pacific Coast and abroad . In time this outlay of more than 8130,000,000. including California Petroleum properties , should have an important bearing on the earning power of this big independent oil unit .
