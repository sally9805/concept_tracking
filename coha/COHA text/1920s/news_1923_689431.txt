txt Movement of railroad stocks in the last few days has been sufficient to justify a reference to the present as a " rail market , " and the most striking difference between this and the rail market in the fall of 1920 is seen in the character of the buying in the two periods . While the former was primarily an industrial market , rails followed with Q considerable degree of activity , imparted in large measure by termination of the guaranty period and resumption of operations for company account . Buying of rails this summer and up to the present has been marked by intelligence . In the fall of 1920 , all intelligence rested with the sellers , and buying was based on the most preposterous stories and reports . Vhoever has been buying the rails lately ha.e studied traffic conditions , financial structure and earning power , but three years ago buyers acted as though all they knew of traffic had been learned from the nearest traffic " cop " . In short , the rail market of 1920 appears to have been created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even three years ago it was known that Atchison possessed a marvelous financial structure and it had demonstrated a sustained earning power far above its dividend rate , which remains the same . But the best Price'Atchison made that year was 90% , compared with Wednesday 's close of 98% . On the other hand , Atlanta , Birvineham &; Atlantic was pushed up to 12% on the story that the scrapping of the property would realize 28 for the stockholders . This stock last sold at 1% , but it will probably long enjoy the distinction of being the only railroad issue'to soar on its scrap value . Atlantic Coast Line , a high-grade investment issue , never got above 104% in 1920 , against 112% , its present price , but Chicago Great Western common reached 14% and the preferred 88% . The common is selling at 4% , and the preferred , with additional accumulations , is selling at 10 . Delaware &; Hudson is 100 years old and it may be assuniedtherefore that the pealtien- , of the company was pretty well defined three years ago at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highthat year of 108 compared with the present price of 107% . Contrast this with Denver &; Rio Grande , whOse common sold in October , 1920 , at 9 and its preferred at 16% . A month later both issues were selling at % . The Denver stocks were assisted in their movement by stories of the wealth of oil shale along the road . There were two flaws in the argument . In this country there is no immediate wealth in oil shale , and , in 1920 , at now , the stocks , which had been displaced by a judgment , bore no relationship to the property . The position of these stocks is no worse than it was three years ago , but they have since been transferred to the Curb Where they sell occasionally in the fractions . This financial sport was poi : ? ularly described in 1920 as " greasing the rails . " MANORS CENTRAL ERIE Illinois Central made an excellent showing during Federal control and immediately thereafter . In fact , its improvement in the past three years has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of 1920 was 9714 , compared with a present price of 105 . Erie , on the other hand , looked nearly hopeless toward the end of 1920 , but the common reached 21% that year . Nov , with the road doing much better than then , the common sells at 14% . Lehigh Valley , a recognized investment issue , did not come through federal control well , but , as the result of strikes , neither did it do very well in 1922 , nor the early months of this year . The high price of the stock in 1920 was 56% , compared with a present price of 61 . To be sure . Mirrieatailis &; St. Louis has recently gone into the hands of a receiver , but its troubles might easily have been forecast three years ago , when the stock made a high of 21 , or about the present price of the 4,7 " . bonds . Baltimore &; Ohio is not a good example of the better rails , because its position has improved in three years in a degree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common made in 1920 was 49% , compared with a present price of 59% . Meantime , St. Paul has greatly improved its outlook , which appeared almost hopeless in 1920 and now seems more reassuring , but St. Paul common sold at 44% three years ago , as against 16 now , and the preferred at 65 as against 27% . The low price of St. ' Paul common in 1920 was 21 and of the preferred 86% . NEW YORK CENTRAL AND OTHERS Non " could have said in 1920 that New York Central would increase its dividend rate from ** to 7 ' . , but even three years ago it was known that this ' was the country 's premier railroad system . that it traversed the richest part of the country , that it made an excellent showing during government operation , that it had an exceptionolly'Ala4 management , that it had an unbroken dividend record from 1870 . In the same year , it was known that Texas Pacific had been in existence for 45 years , that it had never paid a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was then in the hands of , a receiver facing a third reorganization . But Texas &; Pacific moved a derrick on its right of way and drilled a hole that turned out to he a " duster . " The high price of New York Central in 1920 was 8414 , and the present price is 101% . The " greasing " process to which Texas &; Pacific was subjected three years shot the price to 47 , after having sold at 70% under the ' same influence in 1919 , all compared with the present price of 21 . It is not recorded that Missouri Pacific , the parent company , discovered any oil in 1920 , but its common sold that year at 31% , compared with the last price of 10% . The preferred sold at 55% and now , with another $15 a share in accumulated dividends , sells at 28% . Union Pacific , long regarded as one of the best investment issues , failed to get above 129% in 1920 and 43 now selling at 130 , although the Company came through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wabash , which has greatly improved its position , is selk , ing at 9% , compared with a high of 13 in 1920 . Western Maryland , another small rail that has Shown marked gains in earning power , sells at 9% , compared with a high , of 15% in 1920 . From the foregoing comparisons , it is manifest that persons who are buying rails today are not the persons who bought them in the fall of 1920 , and the buying is , based on very different considerations .
