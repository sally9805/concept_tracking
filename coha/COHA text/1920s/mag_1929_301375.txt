The most popular play that ever ran in Manhattan was Abie 's Irish Rose , which closed with its 2,400th performance on the night of Oct. 22 , 1927 . No one ever learned what glib compelling secret Anne Nichols had put into her play to make so many people want to see it . She herself has not been able to repeat its success ; imitators have been unable , in story , play or cinema to duplicate its homely attractions . <P> One cinema , The Cohens and Kellys , which dealt with the same situation ( Irish-Hebrew romance ) , achieved some box-office attention . Accordingly , last week , Anne Nichols , asking $3,000,000 , was in court to sue Universal Pictures Corp . for plagiarism . The trial proceeded in the higgly-piggly fashion of plagiarism suits , with interminable memorabilia , mentions of long-forgotten vaudeville skits and old plays from which The Cohens and Kellys might possibly have been derived . Some Universal adman had written an advertisement in which The Cohens and Kellys had been called " another Abie 's Irish Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The trial grew to resemble a literary symposium . The names of Shakespeare , George Jean Nathan , Aristotle , Gorky , Ibsen , Bernard Shaw and many another were spoken . Author Nichols ' " dramaturgical expert , " Moses L. Malevinsky of O'Brien , Malevinsky , &; Driscoll , proceeded to a comparison of every entrance and exit in Abie 's Irish Rose with every entrance and exit in the cinema . <P> From the witness stand , Anne Nichols said : <P> " I do n't have time to go to plays . They do n't amuse me . . . . " <P> " I do n't remember my play . I have n't read it for a long time . . . . " <P> " An author 's work is an inspiration . He writes from the heart . You get a situation and dq.the best of your ability to get it down on paper and send ' it to Washington to be copyrighted. . . . "                @ @ @ @ @
