BY concealing her marriage to the Prince until she arrived , the Princess Misknikoff , formerly Mrs. Aimee Gouraud , got her name on the front page of the newspapers . Doubtless this was not her purpose . From her point of view , it may have been an unfortunate accident . But it is an accident that happens here whenever people who get married to Princes , etc. , conceal the fact until their arrival . If publicity is disagreeable to the Princess , she has our sympathy . IS New York a Menace ? The West Wants to Know . " This is the title of a Methodist pamphlet .

His shiny new dimes have had their fame as tips broadcast through the land . Confirmation of his practical economies are never lacking ; and the latest of these is at this time amusing certain members of the Sleepy Hollow Country Club . There is , as a major figure in this incident , Mr. Pat Lagin , who has been a collector of laundry throughout Westchester County for , lo , these many years . Many of his customers , even those most prominent in Brad-street 's , knew him personally . Latterly , Pat changed employers and , so , lost the patronage of Mr. John D. Rockefeller . The present work is satisfactory , so why change ? Such was the reasoning of the Laird of Pocantico Hills . Presently , it occurred to Pat to submit compared price lists .

" A Painter GEORGE BELLOW S , whose Memorial Exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum opens next week , was the only American artist 060 , 4 " who could get space on the front pages of the daily press by virtue of the controversial quality of his work . He commanded the interest , albeit only occasionally , of the common run of his countrymen . I recall , as an example , the wide consideration accorded his " Crucifixion , " which aroused transient interest in art even among such hide-bound conservatives , in this matter , as yellow journals and the religious press . It is not quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American artist , although it has done so before , and perhaps would do it more often if such distinction were earned . Winslow , Whistler , Aiken , Chase , and Fuller have been thus honored , and Sargent is to be early next year , but several of these were American only by birth . Their art , training , and their outlook became European by the time they reached technical maturity . In this respect , again , Bellows was unique . He was a lanky Middle Westerner when he came to town twenty-odd years ago , and he remained so  --  curiously blunt , sometimes even gauche  --  until his death . His knowledge of the masters was limited to what he saw in American galleries , for he never visited Europe . The rest were familiar to him only through black-and-white reproductions . If it is important to have American art , Bellows is the most significant figure our painting has produced . If the importance is to have art , without nationality , he ranks with half a dozen others of the first flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Americanism , which is of the soil , and of the roaring industrial plant , of the streets and of the fields of professional sport . BELLOWS had a wit that savored of the smart ruralist ; of the village general store sage It was after the Armistice that a gentleman suspected of pro-German leanings arose at a banquet to berate one of Bellows 's canvases , which bad for its subject the Germans ' repatriation of Frenchmen too old for labor , and for its title , " Return of the Useless . " " Mr. Bellows 's painting is all the more remarkable , since it was done without his ever visiting Europe , " the speaker commented , acidly . Bellows rose placidly , at the rear of the banquet hall , to defend himself . " Say ! Do you think that Leonardo da Vinci ever had a ticket of admission to the Last Supper ? " he inquired . CERTAINLY , those works of Bellows which are best known among the populace are his prize fight episodes , of which subjects he did six paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented in the Metropolitan 's Memorial Exhibition , the decision being that the works shown should he typical of everything to which he put either pen , pencil , or brush . Perhaps the best realization of the completeness of the collection may be gained through the appended table , which was furnished me by one of the committee in charge of the exhibition . The first column represents the total known works of the artist in each division of his labors , and the second the number of these to be hung in the Metropolitan . Paintings t3o Lithographs 17o Drawings , Sketches , etc. 15o Unquestionably , it will be an interesting show and one may look forward particularly to seeing again " Sacred and Profane Love , " that gorgeous bit of humor with which Bellows tantalized the art critics .

Cycle THEY say , with a sigh of deep regret for the passage of a landmark , that " Abie 's Irish Rose " is on the verge of closing . A verge , however , as applied to this hoary veteran of the Republic Theatre , must be understood to be very wide , indeed . It is not at all unlikely that a full score of plays will be born and will perish before the final curtain rings down on it . Sometime about the first of the year is the date most frequently suggested for the completion of the cycle . And how strange the town will seem if the electric sign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along Forty-second street . For the play has become a large part of our times . It has had great effect on our lives . Wits have become famous , or more famous , by their comments upon it . People date their memories by the time  --  long , long ago  --  when they first saw " Abie 's Irish Rose . " Thus , one gentleman happening to mention the play at a dinner party , was informed by his wife that she had seen it before they were married. , before they were engaged , in fact . And since then the couple has become veterans of the life marital , with all the responsibilities of parenthood now more than a year old . A landmark passes , surely enough . AND what of that wide commun- ity which has lived its separate lives within the confines of the play itself  --  the company which , day in and day out , has performed the comedy for all these bearded years ? Only three members of the original cast remain . In two of the major roles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whalen and the Soloman of the piece . A demure young maiden , Miss Dorothy Grau , also has clung through the ages . When first she appeared she was a mere child , one of the flower girls at the wedding ceremony . But time and circumstance have promoted her . Now she is one of the bridesmaids . Actors and actresses have come and gone at the Republic , while " Abie 's Irish Rose " blossomed perennially . One knight of the buskin married and has become a father since the play began . Another fine old soul passed from the Republic to the larger stage beyond . Three original players have fallen in with the ways of the times sufficiently to have won divorces from sympathetic courts . It has been a separate community within the town 's life , the " Abie 's Irish Rose " company , but soon  --  soon , that is , for this most long-lived play  --  it , too , will disintegrate .

Aesthetics IT is unfair , indubitably , to insist I-that one maintain one 's aesthetic conceptions against the hubbub of everyday life ; and yet , knowing it un " Elegant cah , lady ? " 4 THE NEW YORKER reasonable , I could not but be amused by a late tale of an incident of Macdougal Alley . Mme. Julia Hoyt had found time from her many duties as actress , designer , author , and belle dame , to grant an interview to a representative of one of the many newspaper syndicates whose purpose in life is to keep the provinces posted as to New York 's ways . The gorgeous Mrs. Hoyt was speaking . " I simply adore the aesthetic taste of the Italians , the chivalry and courtliness which is inculcated in them from infancy . They 3.1 At this moment a large indoor baseball bounced through the front window of the Hoyt home , demolished a nice bit of Bohemian glass , and then flopped , most discourteously- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wops , " exclaimed the hostess , jumping up . " I 've told them time and time again to keep out of the Alley . Pardon me while I telephone the police . Beastly little Wops ! " And presently , her mission accomplished , the fair lady resumed , " Let me see  --  oh , yes , I was saying , the true Italian culture and chivalry is found even in the very young ? . " Indubitably , one 's aesthetic conceptions can not always be maintained in everyday affairs , but the contrasts these afford sometimes are amusing . Banks THE Fifth Avenue Bank is to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary , on October 13 . I am not familiar with the degree of exuberance which banks lavish upon occasions of this sort , but the Fifth Avenue Bank seems justified in some form of jubilation , some unbending of its soot-stained red-brick dignity , if only as a polite snicker at the gentlemen , long-passed , who thought its founding a mad dream . Once a hazardous experiment , laughed at by distant Wall Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks which have come , with the northward growth , to the new financial center . It was Wall Street which had to move , via branch banking , to Fifth Avenue territory . With the rush uptown after the population , the banking industry has left behind its icy inquisitions of pros pective accounts , its cold domineering . It has become almost human , perhaps sometimes a little too human . Where once the icy-hearted banker treasured as an asset a life career , from office boy to mahogany desk , now he is inclined to count , as of greater worth , memberships in clubs , ( real or prospective ) ability to play golf and bridge , to turn a pretty compliment . Not that the change is too fundamental , for both the old and the new orders were bent on capitalizing their personal suggestive value . But the modern midtown banker relies for good impression on a carnation in his buttonhole and the latest shirting instead of resorting to a sturdy set of whiskers as of old . Very , very old timers will recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception lay in the notion that the handling of women 's accounts might be profitable . To-day , most of the uptown banks have gone in wholeheartedly for the feminine trade and , with a touch of gallantry , have invited the ladies to their counting houses . And with them have come amusing difficulties . The more acidly economical of the directors , for instance , have come to urge that ash trays , pen holders and such appurtenances be chained to the desks . Long sacred on the tables of the main halls , they now disappear in a most depressing volume from new Ladies ' Departments . Any day you may observe the dear depositors handing stacks of personal correspondence , written on the bank 's expensive stationery , to the bank 's attendant , with the simple directions , " Please post these .

NEW YORK is poorly equipped with concert halls . We have little of such facilities for listening as Queen 's , and Albert , and the half score of lesser halls of London . The Mecca with its lessons of acoustic mistakes well learned from our older auditoriums , the more convenient arrangement of seats we noted ( along with its Moorish decorative scheme ) when we dropped in at a rehearsal , should be an improvement .

ANDSMEN , by the way , are the inveterate gamblers in the musical world .
