Chanler , Albert Sterner , Gari Melchers , A. Sterling Calder . <P> George Bellows never studied in Europe . He was born in Ohio , studied art in Manhattan under Robert Henri . That artist once said of him : " I ca n't teach this boy anything ; he knows by instinct all that it has taken me years to learn . " <P> Mr. Bellows was blithe . He smacked his lips over life . In Art , he belonged to the school of gusto . Wharf-rats , city parks , snowy clustered roofs , great clumping dray horses , seamy faces of dock laborers , pale ladies , prizefighters , gentle landscapes-he painted all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realist . To form he gave a significance from which modernists shrink because it is obvious , conservatives because it is daring and which many art-lovers admire because it is both . <P> Most prized of the pictures by the artist is his Eleanor , Jean and Anna- a study of his young daughter posed between his mother and his aunt . This won the Gold Medal at the Pennsylvania Academy ( Philadelphia ) in 1921 , the first prize at the Carnegie Institute 's International Exhibition in Pittsburgh in 1922 . In the latter year , his picture Nude Girl with a Shawl , provoked a long and animated controversy between artists and moralists when it was exhibited at the National Arts Club .
