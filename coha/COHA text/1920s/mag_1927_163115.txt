Amherst College , couched in classical traditions , announced last week its tenth president-Dr . Arthur Stanley Pease , for three years its professor of Latin . President Pease is not an Amherst man . He received his bachelor 's , master 's and doctor 's degrees at Harvard . He taught at Harvard , Radcliffe and the University of Illinois before coming to Amherst . He is less of a liberal than Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn , Amherst 's eighth president ; he is less of an administrator than Dr. George D. Olds , Amherst 's ninth president . But , as a distinguished scholar , he fulfills the presidential needs of a small New England college . <P> Oberlin College , a Congregational co-educational institution in Oberlin , Ohio , last week invited a stranger to come within its gates . Incognito , he inspected the campus with Mrs. Katherine Wright Haskell , * one of Oberlin 's trustees . Next day , having returned to Chicago and consulted his wife , he telegraphed his acceptance of the presidency of Oberlin . He is the first non-theologian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Ernest Hatch Wilkins , 46 , professor of romance languages at the University of Chicago since 1916 , War-time teacher of French to doughboys , author of Army French as well as Dante-Poet and Apostle , graduate of Amherst College . Some say President-elect Wilkins looks and thinks like the late Woodrow Wilson . <P> At Oberlin he succeeds able Henry Churchhill King , president since 1902 . <P> *Sister of the Wright brothers-Orville and the late Wilbur , famed aeronauts.
