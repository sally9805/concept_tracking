LA FAYETTE-Henry Dwight Sedgwick - Bobbs- Merrill ( $5.00 ) . <P> LAFAYETTE-Joseph Delteil-translated by Jacques Le Clercq-Minton , Batch ( $3.50 ) . <P> " Lafayette , we are here ! " ( 1917 ) attributed something of immortality to that life-loving Frenchman . The tribute is now substantiated by two contrasting biographies which have nothing in common but their enthusiasm for the subject , and their readability . <P> Mr. Sedgwick 's is a serious study ( 418 pages plus impressive bibliography ) , enlivened not so much by any notable literary deftness as by the essential virility of the events he narrates . In satisfactory array he sets the three episodes of Lafayette 's life . First , the familiar youthful adventures in the American Revolution which he undertook in search of gloire . The second episode , less familiar to U. S. readers , is Lafayette 's part in the French Revolution , when for a time many thought him " master of the fate of France . " Undoubtedly his enthusiasm for liberty had much to do with getting the revolution under way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led him to sympathize with abused royalty . But royalty would have none of his sympathy-he a republican constitutionalist . And republican constitutionalists , who had unanimously elected him commandant of the National Guard , grew suspicious of royalist sympathies , which he tried to reconcile with high-flown eulogies on American republican liberties . Thus his command was quickly turned into long years of exile and imprisonment . Retired thereafter to his country estate , he rebuffed Napoleon 's repeated overtures , and did not enter upon his third episode until the revolution of 1830 , when again he tried to establish liberty for the people . <P> Belittling the value of so much fact and circumstance , Delteil devotes impassioned flights of lyrical prose to " inventing " the soul of the man . The French biographer alleges that Lafayette 's passion for liberty , conceived in the free country life of his childhood , took the place of that hairy-chested sensuality which marks the true male . His rightful masculine virility sought expression in idealism rather than the self-assertiveness which would have kept him from repeated failure . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Delteil claims , what has endeared Lafayette to France . " I admire Napoleon ; I like Lafayette . " <P> The great-hearted enthusiasms of Lafayette are no doubt clues to his career , but the silly diagnosis of lack of sexuality is no answer to the nice historical enigma of Lafayette 's essential failure in spite of the eminent positions he attained . Biographer Sedgwick , sober , logical , undertakes to explain that failure by the fact that Lafayette kept a middle course which proved unpopular with both conservatives and radicals . His characteristic indecisiveness proved fatal in a day when Mirabeau , Danton , Robespierre forged ruthlessly ahead .
