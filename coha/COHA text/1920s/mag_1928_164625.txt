The independent State of Liechtenstein , once a fief of the Holy Roman Empire , is now the smallest Principality in Europe ( 65 sq . mi. ) , lies between Switzerland and Austria , produces corn , wine , marble . <P> Last week the Sovereign of Liechtenstein , Johann Marie Franois Placide , Prince de Liechtenstein , Duc de Trappau et de Jgerndorf , lord of vast estates in Austria and Czechoslovakia , and owner of the famed Art Gallery in Vienna which bears his name , decided that it was time for him to take a shrewd step in respect to the inheritance taxes of Austria and Czechoslovakia , for the Prince is now aged four score and eight . <P> The heir apparent was , last week , the Sovereign 's cousin Alfred Aloyse , but he too will soon be dead and his estate the prey of tax gatherers . Therefore the succession to the Throne of Liechtenstein was allotted , last week , to fall upon Prince Alfred Aloyse 's 18-year-old grandson , Prince Franz Joseph Marie Aloyse Alfred Charles Jean Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one , not two sets of inheritance taxes , will have to be paid before young Prince Franz ascends his minute Throne .
