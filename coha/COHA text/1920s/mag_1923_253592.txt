The next President of the United States will be Dr. John Grier Hibben , President of Princeton University-because he sat at the right of Professor William Lyon Phelps at the annual Phi Beta Kappa dinner in New Haven . As toastmaster of the gathering , Professor Phelps pointed out : <P> " In 1907 , when I was toastmaster at the Phi Beta Kappa banquet , William Howard Taft , then Secretary of War , sat at my right . When Tracy Peck made the speech in Latin , he predicted Taft would be the next President . From that moment Taft 's chances became good . <P> " In 1908 I was again toastmaster , and Woodrow Wilson sat at my right . He became President . Dr. Hibben is at my right tonight . There is but one conclusion ! "
