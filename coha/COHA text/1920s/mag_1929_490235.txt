FEAR , running through the jungle like flame , strong as ever . Doom still makes a crackling sound , like summer thunder . Thiliisands of minor clerks and small tradespeople , hearing faint noises of railroads they had never seen , mines they had never worked , steel they had never tempered , fled before the terror of dark . Then came the voices . Two hundred and five for twenty-five thousand steel , said a Morgan , gritting his teeth .

Uninformed dreamers , running a fever . Then came the debacle . They still talked , in husky voices ; but we at least had the satisfaction of knowing that it was costing them anywhere from a hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars a word every time they openedtheir mouths . Many of them have gone quietly back to work . They may not be the most useful citizens in the world , but from now on when they talk they 'll talk about their business or their love affairs and know a little something of what they 're talking about . WHAT finally stemmed the tide V and averted an actual panic in Wall Street was not the intervention of the bankers but the arrival in town of the Rodeo .

ALL this pother about hissing , with Jane Cowl making faces at Christopher Morley and Stoknwski shaking a finger presthsinw at his audience , may lead to some good after all . Hissing is on the up . In most cases , we dislike any noise whatsoever in theatre or concert hall ; but we disagree with Miss Cowl about the sanctity of art . Art deserves an even break and that 's all . We do n't think it ought to he babied too much  --  the wistful intellectuals would get too strong a grip on it . The proper place for hissing , however , is in everyday life . It should be used against the man whotalks shop , and the subway guard who attempts to slice passengers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many bridge players , most policemen , and all cab-drivers . Politically the hiss is an important weapon , and we favor organized claques , with weekly parades and a sort of eisteddfod around election time . THE sudden recognition of John Dewey 's talent , after seventy years , made interesting Americana . He had a birthday and , in a burst of pioneering , the eulogists uncovered him for the country as America 's greatest philosopher . A million people who had n't known of him Friday had heard all about him Monday  --  and accepted him . Of course , one of the things that distinguishes John Dewey for us is the fact that he looks just like Groucho Marx  --  this , over and above the quality of his mind , which is good . It 's a funny thing , but probably only a first-rate philosopher could go seventy years undiscovered by the American press . Even as things were , he might not have been discovered if he had n't looked like Groucho Marx . Phiral QEEKING work , a slightly deaf old gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He conducts his business in one room , the walls of which are lined with shelves on which gaudy certificates are piled . He does all the clerical work himself . He was a member of the Stock Exchange once but sold his seat years ago because the speeding up of modern trading annoyed him . As to the telephone : he was one of the earliest subscribers but he found its jangling irritating and about forty-five years ago had it taken out . A year or so ago , however , he petitioned the company to have his name listed in the directory . He argued that businessmen use the book for reference and that , if he was willing to pay for a telephone subscription , the company ought to be willingto list his name with the notation " no telephone " instead of a number .

A - eight o'clock of a recent morning a truck in the employ of the makers of Eskimo Pic was seen descending Fifth Avenue . At every crossing where a policeman was on duty the truck slowed down , the driver leaned Out , and handed the officer a pie , which in each case was accepted , shucked of its THE NEW YORKER tin-foil wrapper , and devoured . Whet has Mr. La Guardia to say to this ! ' More Progress nURING our visit to the Business Show in the Grand Central Palace last week , a most unfortunate , but interesting , moment occurred when they had to call in a mechanic to fix a biz delay-saving machine which suddenly began to act up and delay things . It was too late to get people away quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the machine to watch it work and we stubbornly stood there while the mechanic got out his tools ( thirty-four tools ) and fixed the thing . The machine adds , subtracts , numbers vouchers , audits , and extends requisitions , if we remember rightly , all at once . Most days it thinks nothing of it . This occasion was just one of those damned unhappy things that happen . The device is one of hundreds of the same general nature , many of them invented within the past year or so , and all of them so bewildering that you just stand and stare . This standing and staring is what encouraged the sales agent to fix his eye on us and lead us to the big machine in the first place . If the contraption had n't broken down we 'd probably have signed up fur a couple , for our sales resistance would be nothing against these Business Show people . They assume at the start that you are president of your company and flatter you with the easy use of large terms , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either got to sign up or break down and confess that all you do per diem is seventy-five thousand . Nobody wants to be humbled like that . When the machine we mentioned did work , it was a treat to watch the young lady who sat in a chair before it and made it go . She hit certain bars and keys , simply and directly , as on a typewriter , but she also pulled things out and shoved things in , spread her fingers like a pianist taking an octave , and used the palm of her hand . The office of the future is apparently coming to a few machines to take the place of auditors and bookkeepers . Such an office will be depressing because of the soporific effect of the regularly repeated clickings and clackings . The Business Show met this situation by selecting only the very prettiest girls to operate the contrivances . One of them sat behind a gold velvet curtain through which only her hand , slim , bejeweled , lovely , was thrust to play upon the keys of an **30;445;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inhuman precision of machinery can be successfully modified by combining it with sex allure , on account of the known high degree of fallibility of the latter . Obviously the businessmen are n't quite sure about this themselves , for we saw many of them frowning iind pursing their lips . The most interesting scenic display was of a telephone-typewriter . You sit at a typewriter and write something and the words are reproduced immediately on other typewriters electrically connected with it . The other typewriters are usually in other cities . You save money by using it instead of actually talking over the phone . The display showed a factory in Albany and a sales office in New York , each with a typewriter , and in between an elaborate stage set depicting the Hudson River , with a little toy train running between the two towns . The train got out of order while we watched . Cry in the Night DEGGING your pardon , we will 1 -- P return to Groucho . He played in Newark last week , and one night attempted to return to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastnesses of Nether New Jersey . He could n't even find Hoboken . After several twists and turns through strange dark and unlikely streets , Grouch() leaned out of the car and shouted to a man : " Can you direct us to the Seacoast of Bohemia " Galante ; NE delicacy few uptowners ever VV sample is dried octopus . Its sale and its consumption are confined almost exclusively to that busy **29;477;TOOLONG q on rte r just north of the Battery , and one small grocery store in Washington Street , that is owned by Mr. Homatas , supplies most of the trade . Mr. Hamatas imports his octopuses from the Mediterranean or our own southern waters , dries and salts them , and stores them in the hack room of his shop . The place is full of octopuses , each with its tentacles neatly twined around a small wooden frame upon which it is delivered to customers . He prepares them far in advance of orders .

A la Russe JUST back from Russia , a big machinery man we know talks for hours about that land , but tells only three interesting things . First , he saw a Russian filming of O'Neill 's " Desire Under the Elms . " The director had got confused on his America and the New England farmers all appeared 0 in western dress , with chaps , revolvers , and lariats  --  dour cowboys frustrated by the land and the weather . Second , he saw another movie in which Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were " starred . " When those two visited Moscow , it seems , brief shots of them were taken so adroitly as to he made to fit into a six-reel feature picture . It is a big success . Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czar 's summer palace in the Crimea he saw , hanging on the wall , a print of " September Morn . " General Depression THE Great Flurry downtown did reach deep all right . Someone was about to call the operator from a drugstore phone booth in upper Broadway when the bell rang . A clerk came from behind a counter and answered it . " I 'll see if 1 can get him , " he said and he went out on the sidewalk and gesticulated . The traffic cop out in the street nodded and came to the phone . " Down to nine , eh ? " said the cop . " What would ya advise me to do ? . Huh ? . . . Put in an order to sell at market ? ... Okay , go ahead and get me out . " He hung up and went back to his intersection . THERE were also several minor flurries uptown that we heard about . The electric-light industry had a had moment , and right after the Edison jubilee , too . A part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ninety-fifth , went out , leaving under the legend " World 's Best Entertainment , " the glaring word " phony . " About the same time Paul Whiteman and his hand were broadcasting , and at the proper moment Mr. Whiteman announced : " This is Paul ' Whiteman and his orchestra broadcasting the Old Goldhrrmph , hrrmph ? Hour . " This added to the general depression , and finally we discovered that Rogers Peet &; Company had reached a low in their theatre-program advertising . You will recall how they work in the name of every play as it comes along . Well , their ad for " Strictly Dishonorable " is headed , simply , " Performance . " Singing Cop FEwof the people who see " StrictlyDishonorable " know that in the real life of Edward McNamara , who plays the part of the police officer in that popular show , lies a romantic story . McNamara actually used to he a policeman in Paterson , New Jersey , his birthplace . He was also an Elk . As both he was popular , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all the benefits and smokers in Paterson . One spring , the committee in charge of a music festival engaged Schumann-Heink as a guest artist and found her fee so high that nothing was left to hire other artists . McNamara was called in , and sang with unexpected results . At the end of the concert Mme. Schumann-Heink announced that he had the best voice of any American she had ever heard and offered to take him with her on a tour of the country . He turned in his badge , bought a dress suit , and was off . He was gone a year or two . At the end of that time he returned to Paterson and took up the lazy comfortable life of unofficial entertainer at the Elks ' Club . He was sitting in an easy chair there one afternoon when Senator William Hughes ( Wilson 's backer , and a friend of Mac ) burst into the place and bundled him into a taxicab . It developed Hughes hod been in New York talking to Regan , of the old Knickerbocker Hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenor in the country . Regan had laughed at this , saying that he had the best tenor in the country staying right in his hotel . Hughes yelled , insisted upon a competition between the two , and dashed off to New Jersey in the cab to get his man . Returning with his contender in three or four hours he was met by Regan , bland , smiling , confident , who led them into the elevator , and up to the room of his tenor , who turned out to he Enrico Caruso . Everybody got a good laugh out of the joke . Hughes insisted that his man he allowed to sing , however , and be was . McNamara sang " Dio Possente " from " Faust . " Caruso made him repeat it three times and then announced that he had just listened to the best voice he had heard in America . The master and McNamara hail a long talk . The latter , it developed , bad never had a teacher . This pleased Caruso , who had never forgotten that the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up bricklaying . In the end Caruso decided that he himself would take the new tenor in hand , and for seven happy months the former policeman was his pupil . Then Caruso went home ; the war began . A LONG interlude followed , which terminated when Otto Kahn heard McNamara sing at a banquet and offered to sponsor him . He studied for several months and then was granted an audition at the Metropolitan . No good came of it . GattiCasazza waved him aside . He remained aside until the eccentric producer , Mr. Davis , produced " The Ladder . " McNamara was engaged to sing a song . A year later , following one of the rewritings of this show , he was given a part of some importance in it and distinguished himself as an actor . Nobody much saw him , however , except Brock Pemberton , who remembered his work well enough to give him the present part in " Strictly Dishonorable . " Et had trouble right up to the opening night , though . The author wanted to drop him because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good lines in the show as finally presented are ones he put in out of his recollections of a cop 's life . At present McNamara 's comparative affluence enables him to assist Paterson policemen who need uniforms and so on , and to take lessons from Amato , who , in his retirement , coaches a few pupils . In the old days in Paterson , on dull nights , the officers in the reserve room used to get out the station victrola , put on one of Amato 's records , and Mac would sing along with it , while the desk sergeant nodded in time . Station Scene ON Wednesday afternoon a gentleman who had been sleeping in the waiting-room of the Great Neck railway station awakened suddenly and stared about . " Got to get the 4:07 ? the 4:07 , " he muttered . This was ap parently addressed to a mild man sitting next to him who , thinking he detected belligerence in the tone , retreated deep into his newspaper . The other 's gaze finally settled on the clock on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hm ... the 4:07 's late . " He settled down and went back to sleep . Greyhounds A gain OO UR mention a few weeks ago of Richard , the too-affectionate greyhound , has brought a letter from one of the judges of the International Greyhound Racing Association , telling us more about these animals . Richard was the ring who , when he heard his master cheering him on , stopped racing entirely and ran over , wagging his tail , to he petted . It seems that both Richard and his master must have been beginners at the game . Must owners guard against such incidents by giving each dog two names : thus , Memphis Minstrel answers only to the name of Mike ; Damon Runyon and Dashing Chorus are , respectively , Jock and Blondie to their friends ; Cashoo , the record-breaker , is Felix around the kennels . The dogs are never addressed by their program names . This keeps them from getting confused . Lately , the International Association has been working hard to remove all taint of skullduggery from the sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered under assumed names  --  to get long odds on a sure thing , but all that has been done away with now . Every dog entered on the International Circuit must be examined , and its characteristics ( color , sex , weight , age , length of tail , color of toenails , scars , markings , etc. ) checked on its " Bertillon card , " which in turn is registered with the Association . One peculiarity greyhounds have : their eyes , normally , are brown , but during the heat and excitement of the race they turn green as any cat 's . Counter-Blast AGENTLEMAN was attracted the other afternoon into the Dodge showroom in Broadway , where they are exhibiting one of the latest knicknacks of automotive engineering  --  a radio set installed in every car , with the dials on the instrument board .
