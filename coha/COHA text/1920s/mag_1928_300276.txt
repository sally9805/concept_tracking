PENELOPE 'S MAN : The Homing Instinct <P> - John Erskine-Bobbs-Merrill ( $2.50 ) . <P> Odysseus was ten years getting home from Troy . Therefore , Homer proves him a hero of the sort that is resourceful when shipwrecked , patient when detained . But Erskine proves him a liar of the sort that is shrewd enough in pursuit of romantic adventures , and shrewder yet in making them appear less romantic than brave . Not shrewd enough however to deceive Penelope with his tale of trying for ten years to get home . " Trying , my dear man ! Who kept you back ? " - " Fate . " - " What was her other name ? " <P> It seems there were a variety of names-Daphne , Circe , Calypso , Nausicaa-but all had the one purpose of beloving Odysseus bearing his children , and getting rid of him when he grew boring . Daphne , lotus-eater , was perhaps the most charming-that is , until she referred casually to the custom of her country that would require Odysseus ' death as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , however , his mission as chosen father , he escaped to the next island and succumbed to the charms of Circe ( he later described her to Penelope as " a witch , rather distressing to look at " ) . Calypso , " a large female , beautifully proportioned . " endured him longest-seven years-and not until their several children all showed a lurking lack of virility did she decide that it was time their lazy father should return to his long neglected wife . <P> Not that Penelope cared . In fact she was enjoying her house-party of suitors , and had just chosen one of when her grizzly spouse turned up with his detained-at-the-office fairytale . <P> Erskine 's version , mildly amusing , suffers in that it can not share the novelty of his Helen of Troy . Homer 's , if less convincing , is nevertheless rather more entertaining .
