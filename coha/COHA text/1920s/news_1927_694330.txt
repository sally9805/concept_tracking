" " Yes , you do , " persisted the Court . " Well , " Berlin went on , " Taylor was a man who never bothered anybody . I wanted to be in with the others . It was in March , five or six years ago . Morris Smith and I went to the Health Department together . Smith had the money , and we told Taylor about wanting to make him a present . Taylor would n't talk to me , so Smith remained and I went outside his office . " " Smith was the one who had the money , " interjected the Court . " That is what talks . ' Berlin said that when Smith joined , him outside he said he had put the money in Taylor 's pocket . ? . It is expected that Smith will be called later .

William Teitler of 314 Avenue F , Brooklyn , formerly an ice cream manufacturer at 8 Cannon Street , told of giving Taylor $100 twice in 1921 . " I did n't give it into his hands ; I was afraid he would n't ' accept it , " Teitler said . " I used to manufacture ice cream in a stable where there were horses and I decided to remodel it . I showed the plans to Taylor and he suggested changes . I appreciated what he had done and decided to give him a present . I placed the money in an envelope and put it in his outside pocket . " " Did n't he say to you , in substance , that if he liked you everything would be all right ? Did n't you tell Judge Kelby something like that ? " asked Mr. Pecora . " He likes me all right ; he thinks I 'm a gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor was about to go on a vacation , Teltler said he gave him another present of $100 . The witness told of paying Inspector Morrison $10 a month for four or five months at the suggestion of another dealer . While the payments were made no complaints were entered against him , Teitler said . He told of Morrison 's transfer and the appearance of Inspector Goldman , who. he declared , said he was " not as cheap as.the other inspector . " According to the witness , Goldman at first demanded $25 a month , but finally agreed to accept $15 . These payments continued for four or five months , Teitler said , and continued in 1926 after Commissioner Harris had assumed office . Says Walsh Asked $1,000 .

Sahn said Walsh asked him how many members the association had and when told there were twenty answered , " Well , $1,000 will be all right . " Irving B.

Neuschtat , known in the Health Department as the " millionaire kid . " He said Neuschtat agreed to let him churn butter in return for the money and that he had at first demanded $50 a week . Justice Tompkins characterized the case as one of extortion and oppression . " Neuschtat said he would take care of the ' big man , right in the office , ' out of what I paid him , " Shapiro testified . Federal Inspector Mentioned .

" Kaufman wanted $750 to close the Lapof establishment , Wolfe said .

Lapof said Clougher telephoned to the Health Department and the policeman ? was ordered out at 11 o'clock Wednesday night and he did business uninterruptedly the following day . ' After his ? place had been closed , Schonzeit said he appealed to Inspector Walsh at the Health Department , but Walsh told him he could do nothing . " I belonged to the association and part of the money they gave Kaufman to close me up was actually paid them by me as ' dues , " Schonzeit protested .

Samuel Cohen , formerly with the Suffern Dairy Company , 425 Cherry Street , told the court that former Inspector Charles P.

Frankel , editor of a baking trade paper , said he could name 300 bakers who had to pay graft to continue in business . He could give no names . Justice Tompkins told him to bring in as large a list as he could at 10:30 o'clock next Thursday to which time the hearing was adjourned . SAYS CITY GETS BAD BUTTER . Harris Acts to Bar Sales of lin= pasteurized Product . New regulations by the Health Department requiring that all butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream were indicated by Health Commissioner Harris . Dr. Harris said that at a conference at the Department of Health with Charles F. Droste , President of the New York Mercantile Exchange , and Frank G. Henry , its business manager , he had asked them to meet him again to discuss the exclusion from New York of all unpasteurized butter , which he said was a source of danger because of harmful bacilli . " I was assured of their cooperation , and I now see my way clear to getting a wholly pasteurized butter supply for New York City without increasing the cost to the consumer . " Dr. Harris said . " Some years ago we depended largely on foreign markets because the sources of supply here were scant and we could not demand pasteurized butter . The high tariff now excludes most foreign butter , except for occasional shipments from New Zealand and Denmark . Our supply in New York comes from a limited number of dealers , chiefly in the West , which makes the problem much more simple . " Dr. Harris placed evidence collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials of the Exchange . He said they assured him that a meeting of the Exchange would be called to adopt a method . of chemical analysis of butter by wholesale dealers which would prevent excessive moisture in the butter they handled . Dr. Harris said the Exchange officails pointed out that they had no control over retailers who may add water to butter to soften it . Some retailers , the Commissioner declared , actually add water to their butter , pounding it in with a mallet , to make the butter weigh more . An additional 8 and 10 cents a pound is charged for this type of butter , he said .
