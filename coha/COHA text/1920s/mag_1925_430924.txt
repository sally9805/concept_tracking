I HAD seen Houdini on the stage ? many times . I saw him first 20 years or more ago , when he was known as the " Handcuff King , " and was exhibiting his astonishing ability to escape from shackles , ropes , chains , straitjackets , locked trunks , and a variety of other bonds and entanglements . I had seen him in more recent years cause a five-ton elephant to disappear from the stage . I had seen him shackled and thrust head first into a metal cylinder filled with water , over which a tightfitting cover was padlocked . There seemed no possible escape for him from this dreadful contrivance ; yet , only a second , it seemed , after the big can was screened by a curtain , he emerged , dripping and breathless , the shackles in his hand and a smile on his face . I had seen him perform his famous needle trick in which he swallows four or five packages of needles and many yards of thread , and then has a member of the audience pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had seen his amusing but highly instructive and useful exposure of the tricks of fraudulent spiritualistic mediums . But my greatest surprise from this master conjurer was reserved for a few weeks ago when I visited Houdini at his home in New York City . I found Houdini the man a more extraordinary personage even than Houdini the magician ! Houdini the magician ? the man known to the public ? is a professional trickster , an expert showman ; spectacular , theatrical , practised in every artifice and device of the public entertainer . Houdini the man , though , is a student and scientist , who prefers his library , stocked with a quarter of a million dollars ' worth of books , on every conceivable subject , to any other place on earth . He is master of six languages , and is versed in the literature produced by the greatest thinkers in all six tongues . He has profound knowledge , both practical and theoretical , of the natural sciences . He handles mechanics ' tools and the delicate apparatus of the physical and chemical laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , a psychologist , an anatomist , an inventor , a brilliant talker , a world traveler . He has known the greatest men of his time and in these contacts has contributed quite as much as he has taken away . He is an athlete , who by training and selfdenial has kept to middle life the lithe , powerful body necessary to the performance of his amazing feats . He is a business man , whose shrewd investments have made him one of the wealthiest men of the theatrical world . AND it is Houdini the man who dominates Houdini the magician . As Houdini himself expresses it , " I could make a fortune every year on the stage ? if I wished to . " Houdini the man , however , will not permit this . For five months each year Houdini the magician appears before the public ; the other seven months belong to Houdini the man . Then it is that Houdini immures himself in his library to read , study , write , and to invent . It may seem surprising that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of body should possess so remarkable a passion for pursuits of the mind . Actually , though , there is nothing surprising about it ; for Houdini was a scholar and a teacher long before he became a magician . The son of a clergyman and educator , he was reared in a scholastic atmosphere , and almost before he was out of knee pants , he taught modern and ancient languages in the school his father conducted in Wisconsin . " Books were my hobby , even as ) a child , " he told me . " I read almost every book in the Milwaukee Public Library before I was 15 . My reading was not systematic . It made no difference to me whether they were fairy tales , textbooks , philosophic essays , poetry , or romantic fiction . Some of the books I did n't understand ? but I read them just the same . I believed , you see , that my life work would be teaching , so I wanted to learn everything I could about every possible subject . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-lover should take up such an unusual profession as magic ? " I suggested . " I went into magic more or less suddenly and by accident , " Houdini said . " When I was about 15 I was attending a magician 's performance with some friends . I had n't studied magic particularly at the time ; yet I was n't mystified at all . Each time the magician would complete a trick , I 'd tell my friends , I know how he does that , ' and at last they got tired of hearing me say it . Well , if you 're so darned smart , ' one of them said , ' why do n't  | you go on the stage and do those tricks yourself ? ' All right , ' I said ; I will . ' And I did . " That was more than 35 years ago , " continued Houdini reminiscently , " and I 've been at it ever since . I made up my mind at the beginning , though , that if I was going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . There seemed only one way to make sure of that , and that was by devising my own tricks ? tricks that no one had ever seen before . " My habit of reading stood me in good stead . I bought every book on magic that I could find , taught myself to do every trick that was described ? and then discarded them all and invented original tricks and constructed with my own hands the apparatus necessary to perform them . And I 've been doing that ever since . Every illusion I ever have performed has ben conceived , constructed , and executed by me alone . And not one of them , " he added after a moment , " ever has been correctly explained . I have performed them before millions of people . I have performed them privately before professional magicians ; and they are still secrets ? mysteries ? known to me alone . " One of the greatest thrills I 've ever had came when I was a young performer and it was reported to me that Kellar , dean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled audiences : " Do n't be ashamed if I mystify you . I have seen Houdini 's work , and I have no idea how he produces his effects . ' " " Do you intend ever to explain how you produce your effects ? " I ventured . " Certainly , " Houdini answered . " I 'll explain to you right now . I produce my effects by natural , physical means ; by utilizing wellknown laws of science and mechanics for the purpose of mystifying . I have no occult powers . I can no more tell you what you are thinking about at this moment than I can cause those buildings opposite us to collapse by waving my hand . " I can not transfer my thoughts to another person 's mind except through some recognized form of communication . I can not bring back the spirit of one who has departed . If you were to lock me in this room , I could not escape except by means of a key , violence , or the employment of the purely physical skill I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can make it appear that I am able to read your mind , to transfer my thoughts , to establish communication with the dead and so on . " Houdini excused himself for a moment and returned with a blank slate . We sat at opposite sides of a small table , and he thrust the slate beneath it and requested me to take hold of it . An instant later there came a scratching sound from under the table . When this ceased , Houdini released his hold on the slate and bade me raise it and look at it . The slate contained my name , home address , and home telephone number , written in chalk ! " Mystifying , is n't it ? " inquired Houdini , laughing at my expression of astonishment . " You 'd almost believe me , would n't you , if I told you a spirit wrote that ? Well , I 'm the spirit that did it . " Look here . " he directed , thrusting his hand beneath the table and drawing out a second slate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw me bring into the room . The slate you have in your hands was under that table for several hours ? message and all . I wrote that message when you phoned me that you were coming here . It was an easy matter for me to get your home address and telephone number from the directories when I knew your name and occupation . When I asked you to hold the slate with me under the table , I made a switch , ' handing you the prepared slate , which I released from a clamp that held it against the under side of the table and placing the blank slate in the clamp . The writing sound you heard I made with my finger nail on the surface of the blank slate . " That , of course , is a very simple trick ; yet through it I probably could have convinced you that I was a mind reader , a medium , and what not . Just a moment , and I 'll show you something even more astonishing . Write a message on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The message I wrote was : " Houdini is the most mysterious man in the world . " " Thanks , " smiled Houdini as he read it . " I hope I deserve the compliment . Now turn the slate face down , and do n't let any one see it . " He walked to the door , and called upstairs , requesting Mrs. Houdini to join us . When she came in , her husband presented me to her , the three of us exchanging the polite commonplaces that are customary on such occasions . Not once that I could notice did Houdini make a signal or voice any thing beyond the conventional remarks incidental to introducing a guest in his home to his wife ; yet not more than 20 seconds after she had entered the room , Mrs. Houdini turned to me , smiled , and said : " You wrote on that slate , Houdini is the most mysterious man in the world . ' " " How on earth did you tell her that ? " I demanded of Houdini after his wife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied . " Mrs. Houdini and I used to do a mind-reading act , and have a secret code of communication ? made up entirely of natural gestures , words , and so on ? which permits us to exchange the most complicated messages in the presence of others without detection .  | " And , " continued Houdini , speaking most emphatically , " there is just such a natural and physical explanation for every trick , every illusion , every psychic phenomenon , ' every supernatural manifestation ' I have ever seen . There may be genuine psychics . There may be spiritualistic mediums who actually can establish communication with the dead . There may be those who can transfer their thoughts directly to the minds of others . On these points I have an open mind ; I am willing to be convinced . All I can say is that I have combed the world over in search of those who can perform such wonders without trickery ? and have failed to find them . " " WHY do you devote so much of your stage performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediums ? " I asked . " For several reasons , " Houdini answered . " In the first place because the investigation of psychic phenomena interests me . It 's one of my chief hobbies . I have studied and investigated psychics , mediums , and other supposedly superhuman wonder workers for 35 years in all parts of the world . I have learned their tricks and have found them good theatrical material . " Besides , in the public forum which I conduct at each performance of my stage work , the questions I am asked by the audience indicate that the public is more keenly interested now in spiritualism than in any other phase of occult manifestation . The questions that come to me through the mail likewise show tremendous public interest . " And , although I mention it last of all , my chief reason for exposing the tricks of fraudulent spiritualists is because I believe that by so doing I am performing useful public service . There are throughout the world many mediums and other kinds of self-styled psychics who are using trickery to prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their victims number thousands . Millions of dollars have been taken by them from their dupes . Knowing their tricks from my own personal observation and experience , I consider it my duty to warn the public against them . That is why I have been so active of late years in exposing fraudulent mediums . It has cost me much in money and time , but my crusade has repaid me mightily in the satisfaction of knowing that I have reduced materially the number of these vultures by exposing them and their methods . " " THERE is , of course , a legitimate use trickery . When other magicians and I employ it to entertain and amuse , we are performing a useful service , quite as much as are musicians , dancers , and other stage folk . The skill with which we mystify has been acquired by long , patient , arduous practice . We must practise continuously and forego many of the pleasures of life in order to retain our skill . Thus , I have never smoked nor drank . I  | leas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contortionist said , I must starve myself to do my work , and I 'll starve if I do n't work . ' " " You 're convinced , then , that all psychic phenomena are produced by trickery ? " " All that I have seen , " said Houdini ; " and I 've searched far and wide for genuine manifestations . For years I 've offered as much as $10,000 to any medium , psychic or seer who could produce a physical manifestation of his boasted power that I could not reproduce by natural means . I 've had some challenges  - -  but I still have my $10,000 . I wish , he added with a smile , " that some medium would make me a counter offer on the same terms ? to reproduce by his methods a trick that I would perform by mine . " What do you consider your best trick ? " I asked him . @# @# @# " I SHOULD N'T care to select any single trick as my best one , " he replied thoughtfully . " My four best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture chamber ( this is the trick , described above , in which Houdini is locked in the metal cylinder filled with water ) , the needle trick , and permitting myself to be shackled , nailed into a packing-case weighted with 500 pounds of pig iron , and thrown overboard . " " You say you perform all these feats by trickery , " I said . " Does that mean that when you 're thrown overboard , for example , you 're in no physical danger ? " " I 'll say it does n't ! " responded Houdini fervently . " Of course , I perform no tricks without rehearsing them ; yet there is always the danger of some little thing going amiss and not only spoiling the trick , but spoiling me as well -- permanently . The former has happened several times , and as a result I 've had some very narrow escapes . " I permitted myself to be shackled hand and food and buried alive in California some years ago . I had previously escaped successfully from graves from one to five feet deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I lost my self-possession temporarily . As a result , instead of proceeding calmly and carefully about the work of freeing myself , I began to struggle , frantically and aimlessly , and I attempted to call for help . My efforts sapped my strenght ; my attempts to shout caused me nearly to be suffocated . Luckily I mastered myself in time , and managed to squirm to the surface more dead than alive . And if it rests with me , that is the last time that particular trick ever will be performed . @# ANOTHER time , I nearly brought my career as an entertainer to a sudden end by doing the Chinese torture chamber trick in a cask of ale . The fumes of the ale intoxicated me , and I have no recollection to this day of completing the trick . " In Buffalo , N. Y. , several years ago , a gang of longshoremen from the lake front accepted my challenge to any one to tie me so that I could not escape . They came  | ( Continued on page 156 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other apparatus they used in loading cargo on steamers . I thought I had seen about everything in the line of bonds and shackles , but those fellows produced a brand new assortment ! I managed to free myself eventually , but I have never forgotten the experience , for a heavy chain that they tightened about my waist with levers crushed one of my kidneys , necessitating my sleeping with a pillow under my back ever since . " IN BERLIN , Germany ; once , a man walked to the stage , and produced from his pocket a small , glittering object . I shuddered when I saw it , for I recognized it as what is called a thumbcuff . ' This is a particularly devilish sort of handcuff , consisting of a small plate about three inches long by an inch wide , with two circular holes , each just large enough to admit one of the thumbs . This is slipped over the thumbs to the second flange . Then a nut at the side is turned , and circles of small steel pins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any movement of the hands causes these needle points to tear the flesh . Obviously if one attempts to pull his thumbs free , the flesh about the joint and the thicker upper flange will be lacerated cruelly . " Well , having challenged the City of Berlin to produce anything it could in the way of handcuffs , I had to let the man put the thumbcuff on me . Also , I had to escape if I could . " It was one of the most painful experiences of my career . The spikes penetrated to the bone , and the bleeding flesh hung in strips from my thumbs when at last I dropped the thumbcuff to the stage . Never has one of my tricks been greeted by more tumultuous applause than came to me for this demonstration , which actually was not a trick at all . And when I left the theater , I found myself surrounded by a cheering crowd that raised me to its shoulders , and then unhitched the horses from my cab to draw me in triumph through the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , I permitted myself to be shackled hand and foot and dropped through a hole cut in the ice into the Allegheny River , near Pittsburgh , Pa . In prospect there was nothing terrifying about this feat . I have always been a strong swimmer , accustomed to taking my dip winter and summer . I had made hundreds of water handcuff and rope escapes ; so when they dropped me into the hole I was quite as calm as though merely going through my stage routine . " HOWEVER , I had failed to take into consideration one tremendously important item ? the swift current of the dyer . As a result , I was carried downstream , and when my body rose I was under the ice , which was several inches thick . I had no idea where the hole in the ice was located , I could not , of course , cut another hole through the ice ; nor was there any way in which I could signal my plight to those who were waiting for me to emerge .  | My only hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been dropped . I do n't believe I ever did so much fast and serious thinking before or since . As swiftly as I could ; I released one of my hands . Then I began moving arouns in circles , dragging my body along by digging the handcuff on the other wrist into the ice above my head . Gradually I made my circles larger , and at last reaching upward , my hand touched the edge of the hole . Seizing this with the other hand , I anchored myself ; then went about my work of releasing myself from the remaining bonds : A few seconds later I climbed out of the water to face a white-faced , frightened group of persons who , because of the length of time I had spent in the river , were ready to give me up for lost . And to this day they have never known how nearly right they were !  |
