Practically every Tammany district leader has been taken care of by the Mayor . The last one to receive an office was James J. Hagan , who was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Public Works in the Manhattan Borough President 's office . The Mayor 's inauguration ceremony was one of the shortest on record . It was all over soon after noon , and for the rest of the day the corridors of City Hall were deserted . While the ceremony of inaugurating the Mayor was going on , Murray Hulbert , who succeeds Major F. H. LaGuara dia as President of the Board of Aldermen , was holding a reception of his own in the Aldermanic Chamber . The room was crowded , many Aldermen of former years being present . In the throng was Charles Fornes , former President of the board . He served during the administration of Robert A. Van Wyck . The roll was called by City Clerk Michael J. Cruise , and Reading Clerk Frank J. Martin read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city officials elected at the last Municipal election . William T. Collins wise unanimously ejected Vice Chairman . Jacob W. Friedman. leader of the Republican minority , declared that the Republican members had known him so long that they refused to nominate one of their nurnbe ? against him . Alderman Frank A. Cunningham of Brooklyn was unanimously re-elected Chairman of the Committee on Finance . Although Michael J. Cruise was elected City Clerk last May to succeed the late P. J. Scully , there was some question whether he was elected for a six-year term or only to fill , the unexpired term of Scully , and to settle all doubts he was ' re=elected by the board . The Republicans paid him the compliment of giving him their vote . Martin J. was re-elected Sergeant-at-Arms at a salary of$2,088 and eight ? assistants were elected at salaries of $1,823 . Joseph C. Lawler was re-elected Secretary to the Chairman of the Finance Committee and Mrs. Anna C. Donnor was re-elected stenographer to the Committee on General Welfare . These positions pay $2,160 a year each . Hulbert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hulbert said he hoped the board would be a working and not a talking one . " The Board of Aldermen is a lawmaking body , " he said . " It legislates , to a limited extent , for nearly 6,000 , - 000 people . The revision of our antiquated City Charter is nolv under consideration and the powers and duties of the Aldermen will undoubtedly , be very greatly extended . Let us do discharge our duties ? as , to merit the confidence of the people that their interests can be best cared ' for and protected , in the extension of the principle of home rule by giving you , their chosen representatives , the fullest measure of authority . " Solon , who set the State of Athens in order and relieved the poor and humbly born from oppression , declared , ' A people always minds its rulers best when it is neither humored nor oppressed , ' and our immortal Jefferson asserted , . ' They are best governed , who are least governed . ' I trust you will deliberate thoughtfully upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , but better law ; more wisdom or common sense would insure gteater benefits and happiness to the people whose servants we are . May this be the shortest record in acts enacted but the greatest in results achieved . " Alderman Collins assured the President that the Democrats in the board would try to carry out his suggestions , - and he assured the Republican minority members that they would be treated fairly . " we believe , " he continued , " that we have the confidence of the people of this city and we hope so to act in the next two years that no citizen can point the finger of ' scorn at us . " Alderman Friedman assured the Democratic members that the Republican minority would co-operate with the majority . Aldermen and Keller were then appointed a committee to notify the Mayor that the board had organizea and was ready for business . The Mayor , when he had . finished with his own affair , visited the board and made a short speech in. which he advised the Republican and Democratic members to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another Salary Increase . " When any one comes into my office and offers a suggestion , " said the Mayor , " I always ask him if it is in the ' interest of . the people . If he tells me it is , I listen and always try to carry out the suggestion . " The Mayor strongly intimated that he would approve an increase in salary for the Aldermen . Two ' days ago the salaries of all members of the board were increased by the Board of Estimate from $2,000 to $3,000 a year , but he told them this was not enough. ? " The Alderman should receive the best possible salaries , " said the Mayor , while the memberacheered . " Iam not inviting you to askfor an increase , " the Mayor continued , " but if you had asked for $500 more when you got th ? f additional thousand , you would have come " prettynear getting it . " Controller Charles L. Craig , who drifted in during the ceremonies , having just returned from a ten days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a promise of more money . He said it was his intention , to have the Charter Commission , of which he is a member , provide for $5,000 salaries for the Aldermen . He said he had brought back from Canada a new charter . " The fundamental principle of the document , " he said , " is that legislation for the City of New York is to be enacted in New York by the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen , a New York legislative body , instead of by our friends up-State in the Senate and Assembly . " I think that the members of the Board of Aldermen are fully entitled to have that increased salary if it is to have full legislative powers . There is no reason why it should not become a training school for the statesmen of New York City . I ' think the members of the Charter Commission , will have some contest if they try to whittle down that 55.000. " - The . Controller said he thought there was a provision in the present charter that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that he had been unable to find ' it . " Nevertheless , " he ' said . " I ' have bought a camp stool and I am going to bring it over when you vote on special revenue bonds , " Speaking of ' the charter he had prepared , the Controller said : " I wrote it on birch bark and caribou hide with the juice - of hemlock mixed with spruce gum , with a porcupine quill for a pen . in a temperature of thirtyfive degrees below zero . That ink combination is the only fluid that wo n't freeze in that temperature . " - Former Governor Alfred E. Smith , who was inaugurated President of the Aldermanic Board lour years ago , entered the chamber and was cheered as " our next Governor . ' ! He was invited to the speakers ' stand and warned the Administration that the people at the last election had placed great responsibility " squarely on the shoulders of the Democrats to make good .
