txt Challenging the accuracy of statements made by Senator Harding dealing with the railroad issues dealt with in the EschCummins act , Glenn E. Plumb , father of the so-called " Plumb Plan " for nationallzatiob of American railroads , authorized a statement tonight in which he seeks to show that Senator Harding 's construction of the bill is directly at variance with that of Senator Cummins-and Representative Esch , the joint authors of the law . The statement issued by Mr. Plumb quotes the Marion Star of Sept. 14 , in which was printed the full text of Senator Harding 's speech , delivered on Sept. 13 . " This address , " Mr. Plumb asserts , " coming from a member of the United States Senate who voted for the Cummins-Eseh law and upon whom has been conferred by his fellow members in the Senate the honor of representing the Republican Party before the American people as its candidate for President , is so full of direct perversions of the truth that I can not permit it to pass unchallenged . " Senator Harding 's statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for the permanent guarantee of dividends on railway capital . " is replied to by Mr. Plumb with quotations from speeches of Each and Cummins , and he adds : " Senator Harding 's construction of the bill is directly at variance with the admissions of the two men who are charged with the responsibility of its authorship . " Treating now his statement that it ( the Cummins-Esch law ) places a limit on these dividends , " the Plumb statement said , " one would infer , and he evidently intended to have it inferred , that the bill limited the amount of dividends u ? be received , so that they should not exceed the limit fixed . On the contrary , there is no upward limit to the dividends that might be received , but a downward limit below which receipts might not fail . * " The only limitalion upon earnings of dividends which the bill imposes is the limitation that net earnings shall be not less than 6 per cent . yearly. - " Senator Harding 's next statement Is : ' It ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a period of six months which would guarantee a sufficient railway earning to make possible the financing of necessary railway improvements under the control of their owners . ' " Tills statement is pure fiction . The Government guarantees to pay out of the Treasury of the United States to each carrier whatever dividends it failed to earn under existing rates during the six months ' period so that its net income for that six months would be equal to the compen:attion allowed it by the Government for the same period under Government control . This was not a fixing of rates which would guarantee these earnings , but was a guaranty of income to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States to make good the amount which the rates would not earn . " Senator Harding 's next statement 13 : But this guaranty of 411 , per cent . not earning was limited to the period of transition of six months . ' " The bill says : ' Provided , that during the two years beginning Alarch 1920 , the commission . shall take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such aggregate value . ' But may add one-half of 1 per centum thereto in its discretion . " Senator Harding voted for this bill . I can not conceive that he did not study the bill and did not know the truth as to its provisions . Yet if he thought the bill was subject to the construction he placed upon it he can not have read the bill . He says in his speech , ' No law of like importance ever was so speedily enacted . ' It must have been enacted with such : Teed that he did not know its provisions , and now justifies his action by repre:zenting the bill to be that which he thought he voted for . Such ignorance of its trueprovisions conclusively reveals his incompetence as a legislator . On the other hand , if he knew the provisions of the bill and now misrepresents its provisions to the trusting American People he has proved himself unworthy of that confidence which the citizens of a great republic should he warranted in reposing in a candidate for the high office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
