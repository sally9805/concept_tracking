Up to the mossy , domed Cathedral at Esztergom-on-Danube wound a solemn , resplendent procession of robed prelates and civil functionaries heavy with chains of office . <P> A thick snow , softly falling , added serenity to the high occasion , which was no less than the installation of Justinian Cardinal Szeredy ( TIME , Jan. 2 ) as Primate of Hungary , an office which carries with it the rank of Duke . <P> Last week Hungarians honored their new Duke Primate as perhaps subordinate in rank only to Regent Nicholas Horthy of the kingless kingdom of Hungary . The newly exalted Primate is humble of origin , has two brothers who are still village potters , as was his father .
