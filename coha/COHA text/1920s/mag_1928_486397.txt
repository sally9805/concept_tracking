THE third and fourth volumes of the " Intimate Papers of Colonel House , " * edited by Professor Charles Seymour , constitute a notable historical document , a contribution to the story of the American waging of the war and the American participation in the making of the Treaty of Versailles which no future historian can overlook . These volumes , moreover , put Colonel House personally in a better light than did the first two . With the United States in the war , he was able to play a better and a more honorable role . The die was cast . There was no need of his being for American participation in the war one day and against it the next ; no need for the trickery , the insincerity , the double-dealing , and the hypocrisy which made the earlier volumes so sad and so shocking a revelation of the true Colonel House . Moreover , in these volumes the Colonel is no longer merely an unofficial , backstairs personality who relieved the President of endless interviews and made himself the medium of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here he appears chiefly as the officially designated spokesman in Europe of the President , and the leading peace commissioner next to Woodrow Wilson himself . Not that Colonel House could divest himself altogether of the habit of fooling some of those who came into contact with him . Of this let one striking example suffice : his offering to Clemenceau the proposed perpetual Anglo-American guaranty of French territory , a proposal properly ignored by Congress . We now learn that the suggestion of this guaranty came from Lloyd George . House eagerly " proceeded to define it , and on March 20 took it to the French Premier " ? plainly with his tongue in his cheek . Clemenceau , he reports , fell for it " with keen delight . " But the wily House added in his diary on that same day : " I have my doubts as to the Senate accepting such a treaty , but that is to be seen . " One week later his tell-tale diary records this : " I thought I ought to call the President 's attention to the perils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be looked upon as a direct blow to the League of Nations " ! In other words , in a time of great stress and much muddying of the waters , when the whole Peace Conference was nearing the rocks , the Statesman-Colonel drafted for Lloyd George and Clemenceau a proposal whose acceptance he greatly doubted , only to become frightened at his own handiwork , and to warn the President against it . Yet it was accepted by Woodrow Wilson and with his consent was made into a treaty and given to the two Allies . How disgusted with himself the Colonel must feel today that his interference , plus that righteous refusal of the Senate , which he anticipated , to consider the treaty has laid the United States open to endless Gallic charges of perfidy , of obtaining certain concessions in the treaty by this false promise of a permanent guaranty . The whole country still stands accused of chicanery and bad faith because of this supernatural , not to say diabolical , cleverness of the Texas colonel . Allowing , however , for the obvious faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was called upon ? Houghton Main Company $10to play , one can not withhold from Colonel House one 's admiration for his extraordinary industry and devotion , and the dexterity , versatility , and skill with which he played the game . He subordinated everything to his job , and spared himself not at all . As to his all-embracing activities and the remarkable power he exercised , his editor inserts repeated proof . When war came everybody  --  literally thousands upon thousands with an ax to grind  --  wrote to him asking for jobs or seeking , legitimately , to obtain action from the over-burdened departments of the government . As Professor Seymour puts it : Those planning the mobilization of scientific and industrial effort sent him their memoranda for criticism ; industrialists wrote him on the proper method to settle the coal or the railroad problem ; financiers wrote regarding the tax plan of the Secretary of the Treasury ; naval experts on the policy of Secretary Daniels ; journalists on the unsatisfactory relations between the Administration and the press " which have become intolerably tangled . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet ; abroad he was greatly liked . His quiet , ingratiating manners , his unselfishness , his readiness to fall in with every suggestion he could meet , and his eagerness to compromise made him a very welcome plenipotentiary of Woodrow Wilson . Thus A. J. Balfour  --  whom Colonel House believed to be the most liberal member of the British Government ! ? considered his help " inestimable . " Northcliffe wrote that through House " I have been able to effect much more good than I have achieved at Washington " ; this great newspaper magnate rejoiced that Wilson and House were " both pro-English . " Sir William Wiseman declared that it is " difficult for the chronicler to define and the reader to appreciate the position and influence of Colonel House during the World War . " The British and French leaders sought his aid at all times and by it cut through red tape and got things accomplished . Before he held office the British Government actually negotiated directly with him , a private citizen , appealing to him at one time as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England learned early that Colonel House was the State Department ; there is nothing more striking in these volumes than the almost total absence of references to the Department which was supposed to be in charge of our foreign affairs . As for the power the Colonel exercised , he even dared to alter , without asking anybody 's consent , an official dispatch received by him in London from Woodrow Wilson before giving it to Lloyd George and the press ? " reparaphrasing it " is Professor Seymour 's euphemism . For this the Colonel was momentarily disavowed in Washington , but only momentarily . This long record teems with praises of him ; David Hunter Miller glows over the " extraordinary influence " of the Colonel in all the negotiations leading to the writing of the Covenant , and Sir William Wiseman , who was the liaison officer between Colonel House and the British Government , repeatedly pays tribute to Colonel House 's ability , sagacity , and remarkable accomplishments . Much of his popularity was due to the fact that the Colonel loved everybody  --  at least when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearest friend . Balfour , Orlando , Clemenceau , whose grateful kisses are constantly recorded ; Reading , Northcliffe , Tardieu , Lloyd George , Wiseman , Joffre ( about whom the Colonel 's judgment was particularly at fault ) , Foch  --  one gets nauseated finally by the lack of discrimination until one begins to wonder whether there is not much truth in Ray Stannard Baker 's sharp assertion that " There was nothing hard , clear , sure , definite , in his Colonel House 's intellectual processes . " One even for a moment wonders whether Karl Friedrich Nowak , one of the historians of the Treaty of Versailles , has not some right on his side when he speaks of the Colonel as a delightful person who " entirely failed to comprehend what was being discussed with him " ; who " amid the stern realities of the conference table . .. never grasped what was going on between those present . " Yet it is indisputable that the Colonel did play an immensely valuable part in organizing for the Peace Conference both here and abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in snatching other people 's ideas and putting them to work , besides originating a number himself , and doing everything in his power to forward business and hasten the coming of some kind of peace . " My province , " he wrote , " is to keep things running smoothly . . . to find in advance where trouble lies , and to smooth it out before it goes too far . " In other words , he was a service station which was never without its supply of gas . Side by side with all this were the often execrable blunders of judgment which both the Colonel and his editor are frank to record . It is not easy to assay exactly the value of one who by choice tried to play simultaneously the role of errand boy , glorified private secretary , privy chamberlain , and a fairly liberal Talleyrand . Some of his weaknesses are very plain . As I have said , he was an eternal compromiser . The fact that his nature prevented his ever bursting out with passionate emotion against any injustice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from ever taking a strong and unyielding position , made him fall back upon wheedling , upon suggesting other ways of beating the devil around the stump , made him be forever finding alternatives , sometimes furtively , and forever compromising . Never could he put his back to the wall and take a stand , or seek by the power of righteous indignation to overcome the " vanities and ambitions " of the various statesmen , to which Wickham Steed attributes the worst evils of the treaty-making . He deplored privately the policy of the Allies and the United States in starving to death hundreds of thousands of citizens in Central Europe , chiefly women and children , the aged , and the feeble , but as for making an effective outcry against it , no , indeed . If it had depended upon the Colonel to rescue them they would be dying yet . Amusingly enough , the Colonel looked down upon his Chief because Woodrow Wilson was a compromiser ! " The President , " he wrote in his diary , " often tells me that under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours later , he consents . . . . " Plainly this was a grievous fault in anybody else . The difference between them was that Colonel House never recorded himself as refusing to recede , and therefore always left open the line of retreat . He never made a frontal public attack , but was silent at all the meetings , for instance , of the commission that drafted the League of Nations , always seeking to deal with individuals and to mold them behind closed doors ; behind those doors he receded and compromised . Compromise was his and Wilson 's joint undoing . As Leonard Woolf has recently said of Wilson and House at Paris in the London Nation : " Once they began to compromise they were lost , the Allied statesmen saw they had America on the run , and they kept her running until she reached Versailles . " Those skilful men soon had Wilson and House sized up , and knew just how far they could go with them . Every time Clemenceau kissed Colonel House he celebrated another victory , and Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed now that Woodrow Wilson 's gesture of summoning the George Washington to France was a mere accidental one , and that it did not , as is popularly believed , result in the Allies yielding to him . On the contrary , both House and Wilson compromised more than ever after that . As for the record for compromise of the Colonel who himself records the melancholy compromising of Woodrow Wilson , here are a few facts brought out by Professor Seymour : He out-compromised the President by agreeing to a buffer Rhine state which Wilson , to his eternal credit , declined to accept ; he again out-compromised his Chief on the Sarre question : " I advise yielding a little in order to secure harmony so that the accusation would not be made that we were unreasonable . He promised to do this thing . " " This thing " was the present outrageous arrangement , in violation of Wilson 's principles , under which the French have for the last ten years been administering the Sarre Basin . Like Wilson in Paris , the Colonel often overrode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue ; he accepted the wrongdoing without a protest . Together they yielded to Japan on Shantung , thereby so outraging their three fellow-commissioners that one wished to resign to keep his self-respect , and several of the experts did . They themselves were responsible for the denial to the Japanese of their just demands for the incorporation in the Covenant of a statement of the national and racial equality of all member nations of the League , and of their citizens . Swearing they would ne'er consent , Wilson and House consented to French troops camping years upon German soil ; to the failure to specify the exact amount of reparations which Germany was to pay . For the crime of yielding the Tyrol to Italy  --  to which both Lloyd George and Clemenceau were , it now appears , opposed ? Woodrow Wilson , however , alone deserves the reprobation of the 300,000 Germans who are daily violated and outraged in all their feelings by the Italy of Mussolini* . His is also the sole shame for the inclusion of pensions among the legitimate war reparations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic advisers . It was Wilson who , after demanding open covenants of peace openly arrived at , opposed the publication of the peace treaty long after it had been agreed to , and it was not given to the world until copies from Berlin came filtering through to Paris . It was he who was against an international court , and then came round in favor of it . It was he who finally made a stand for Fiume , at last carrying out his public threat to go over the heads of the peace-makers to their people , and then went wrong in the eyes of many American experts . Together these two men bargained away everything for the League of Nations , and then , with rare poetic justice , they failed to carry their nation into it . House was sure that they would win over the Senate if they only compromised enough , so he labored hard and ? On May 26 , 1917 , this same Woodrow Wilson had written to the Russian Government : " No people must bib forced under sovereignty under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wring changes in the Covenant from the Allies to meet Senatorial protests . Again his judgment utterly failed him . Always he was certain that he knew just what public opinion was at home  --  it always coincided with what he wanted or feared . There never was a moment when he hesitated to speak out in the name of the American people as if he were chosen by them to be their mouthpiece . For example , he did not hesitate to tell the Prime Ministers of his belief that the United States would accept mandatories over Armenia and Constantinople , as a result of which the United States has also been accused of breach of faith . " America will not and ought not to fight for the maintenance of the old , narrow , and selfish order of things , " he once wrote to Woodrow Wilson . Yet , as a result of their joint handling of the fate of America , that is exactly what it did . Colonel House now admits that the treaty was bad , that it worked great injustice . Wilson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am opposed to is not the feeling of the pacifists , but their stupidity . My heart is with them , but my mind has a contempt for them . I want peace , but I know how to get it and they do not . " Then he went to Paris and scored , with Colonel House , the most terrible failure to get a just peace and to advance civilization the world has ever seen . Colonel House now confesses it , but the admission was not necessary . It is proved on every page of his book . He and Wilson were both temperamentally unfit to carry through their cause to success . This question will , I suppose , be debated as long as the Peace Conference is discussed at all . Ray Stannard Baker has tried to place the blame for the failure at Paris upon Colonel House as well as the foreign Premiers . His argument is demolished by these " Intimate Papers " at several points ; Colonel House has a complete alibi to the charge that he betrayed his Chief . Professor Seymour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame upon the time and the conditions . By March 1 , 1919 , it had become clear , he says , that " an unbending insistence by President Wilson on his program would precipitate an open quarrel with the European Prime Ministers . They protested that if they yielded it would mean the overthrow of their governments . All were caught in a net of circumstances which made free and reasonable decisions impossible . Tales of confusion in Central Europe , Russia , the Far East , the Near East complicated the problems at Paris . " Now , this was perhaps true at the time . The crucial point of the whole battle was at the very beginning of the negotiations . Then it was that House and Wilson should have pointed out that they would make terms on the Fourteen Points and nothing else ; that they would not yield an inch , as America had pledged its national honor , as the other statesmen had pledged the honor of their countries by promising the Germans in the armistice a peace on the Fourteen Points . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a separate peace , to take the strongest army out of Europe together with the representatives of the only Treasury that had unlimited sums of money in it . Later on they were enchained by their own compromising . Of course , if Wilson and House had obtained an ideal League of Nations and had had it accepted by the United States ; if by this time war had been outlawed , and the promised disarmament of the Allies realized , there might be a defense for their compromising . As it is it would have been far better if , either at the beginning of theconference or about the first of March , the Americans had marched away from Paris without a treaty but with their flags flying . In that case , we should not , as a nation , have a lot of things on our conscience of which we ought to be thoroughly ashamed . Our honor would be unsullied . The beaten Central Powers would not be able rightly to charge us with breaking our word , our national faith . Instead we have Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had we blazed a new and better trail ! However , it is to be doubted whether this could have been done even if those in authority had so decreed , for the peoples back of them had to be reckoned with . " This from the man who in Paris on November 11 , 1918 , sent the following triumphant and adoring telegram to Woodrow Wilson : Autocracy is dead ; long live democracy and its immortal leader . In this great hour my heart goes out to you is pride , admiration , and love . EDWARD HOUSE This same Edward House now writes in the work before us that if he and the immortal leader of democracy had won at Paris he is not sure that their peace would not have been followed by as much bitterness as has resulted from the betrayal at Versailles . The peoples had to be reckoned with ? It was Wilson himself who declared at the first plenary session in Paris that the delegates were all there merely to obey the voices of the plain people who had made the sacrifices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President told the assembled American experts that " the men whom we are about to deal with did not represent their own people . . . " and that " this was the first conference in which decisions depended upon the opinion of ' mankind , not upon the previous determination and diplomatic schemes of the assembled representatives . " Which is right , Wilson or House ? They can not both be . Unfortunately for Professor Seymour , there is proof in his own volumes that if House and Wilson had made a stand they could have achieved much . For instance , when Colonel House got mad at the attacks upon America and its emissaries in Paris he went to Clemenceau and demanded that they cease . They did the next day . Again , Colonel House had an inspiration in the night of October 29 , 1918 , which led to his telling the Prime Ministers , who were then haggling over granting the armistice on the basis of the Fourteen Points , that if they did not yield the President would go before Congress and discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel House on another occasion showed spunk in demanding financial aid for Belgium . On page 351 of volume IV will be found clear evidence of the gravity of the French financial situation which was alleviated only when Colonel House interceded for the French with Lloyd George . The financial straits of the Allies alone gave the Americans the whip-hand . These instances show that when House and Wilson wanted to bring influence to bear they could . Indeed , the two men had every card in the pack with which to play the game , as everyone who was at Paris at that time knows . They were simply execrable poker players , and they lost the greatest stakes for which two men have ever gambled . Colonel House 's volumes prove this . As for the relations of the two men , Colonel House frankly admits that he still loves and admires Woodrow Wilson . He is surely sincere in that , though to admit anything else would inevitably damage his own prestige , since , as he shows , so many of Woodrow Wilson 's acts were due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , memoranda , and programs . On June 10 , 1919 , he confided to his diary : " He Wilson is one of the most difficult and complex characters I have ever known . He is so contradictory that it is hard to pass judgment upon him . . . . When one gets access to him , there is no more charming man in all the world than Woodrow Wilson . . .. He could use this charm to enormous personal and public advantage if he would . . . . " He has no explanation for the break between them and declares that it is a mystery which will never be solved because the explanation is buried with Woodrow Wilson . We are not quite so sure of this as he ; there are three persons who may yet throw considerable light upon it . But it is true that he never received an unkind word in writing from his friend . While he says that he often disagreed with Mr. Wilson , he also flattered him eternally and never ceased to feed his enormous vanity and egotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No man has ever had deeper or graver responsibilities , and no one has met them with more patience , courage , and wisdom . " He assured Wilson that his name " should be linked during the ages " with the League . A little later he found that the growing desire for the League " has crystallized around your name . . . . Now if war can be made impossible what a glorious culmination of your other accomplishments . " Wilson 's speeches always seemed to Colonel House the greatest ever made . " Your speech was as great as the occasion . " On another day : " I believe that what you said today will hearten the world as nothing you have said before . " If it was a melancholy ending which came to their friendship Colonel House may solace himself with the thought that he is but one of a long list . Sooner or later in the nature of things a break had to come . Finally , I would emphasize again the value of the historical revelations which Colonel House gives us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking because of Professor Seymour 's skilful editing . He gives us for the first time the true story of Wilson 's part in the Siberian adventure of the Allies and ourselves ? Wilson 's yielding and agreeing to an unconstitutional act clearly forecast his similar surrenders at Paris . House , too , at first opposed and then accepted , and it appears that the Allies really believed that they had no chance of final victory in France unless they intervened in Siberia ! Here , too , are extraordinarily interesting accounts of the negotiations to obtain an early German surrender by strengthening the German pacifists by American propaganda  --  apparently the President had no contempt for their desire to obtain peace . The whole story of the conception of the League is given in detail , together with a remarkable picture of how the Covenant was finally licked into shape by the League Commission at Paris . Excellently told is also the narrative of the way the armistice terms were worked out by Colonel House and Mr. Wilson ; it is probably the last word on this subject from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portrayal of the admirable work done by General Tasker H. Bliss and Colonel House on the Supreme War Council during the spring and summer of 1918 . The plain effort to be frank and straightforward and the self-revelation of this autobiographical work stamp it as one of the really great personal contributions to American history .
