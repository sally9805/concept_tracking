New Rgime <P> Germany has leapt from frying-pan to fire . <P> The military dictatorship came to an end and General von Seeckt , Commander-in-Chief of the Reichswehr , was deprived of the supreme power he has so effectually wielded since last September . <P> Hopes of a return to normal conditions were , however , quickly shattered . The Government announced the establishment of a state of civil martial law , under which supreme power is transferred to Dr. Jarres , Minister of the Interior . <P> The new rgime was said to be a " somewhat watered " issue of the old . The main difference is that the ban on the activities of the extreme right and left parties is removed . Otherwise , like General von Seeckt , Dr. Jarres may maintain internal peace by using the Army in any way he sees fit . <P> A decree issued by the Bavarian Government , abolishing republican rights , which had been previously denounced by the Federal Government in Berlin , is allowed by the Federal Government to remain in force . Saxony and Thuringia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , been given relief from the military overlordship to which they have for some time been subjected . Possibly this is because the dangers of Bolshevism were considered to have " blown over . " <P> At all events the new measure was widely heralded in Germany as a victory for the Royalists and has excited much bitter comment on that account from the Socialists and Liberals .
