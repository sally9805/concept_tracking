While whistles , bells and yells made farewell din in the narrow harbor of Dunedin , New Zealand , last week , Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd 's South Pole Expedition started from that port for a year and a half in Antarctica . He , his scientists and able seamen were aboard the bark City of New York . There was no breeze flirting down Dunedin 's forested mountains to tap-tap her sails ; so her mateship the steamer Eleanor Boiling hauled her down the narrow Otago Inlet like a puffing rustic leading his wench through a lane . <P> Behind her at Dunedin she left another Byrd ship , the Eleanor Boiling . She is to follow the City of New York about Christmas time , when the Antarctic ice is mushy from its summer 's heat . <P> The City of New York is carrying airplanes , two portable houses , scientific baggage , and a season 's supply of provender . Commander Byrd will set up his base on the Bay of Wales , across the Antarctic Continent from Deception Island ( among the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortnight ago , made tests for his South Polar flight ( TIME , Dec. 3 ) . The Wilkins Expedition is rather a tour de force , another example of intrepidity . Of necessity a swift affair , its scientific observations can be only bird's-eye . <P> The Byrd Expedition during its 18 months on the continent will make thorough explorations within the range of its two planes and of its several dog teams . <P> Reaching the two-mile high elevation of the South Pole is only an incidental goal . Amundsen was there in December 1911 ; Scott in January 1912 . Shackleton almost got there in January 1909 . All three , like Commander Byrd , approached through the Ross Sea , the deep bite into the Asiatic side of Antarctica . Explorer Wilkins is trying from the American side . His distance , from Deception Island , to the Pole is approximately 1,900 miles ( air way ) . That is about the same as the distance ships must go between Galveston and Manhattan , Baltimore and the Barbados . <P> Explorer Byrd , at Dunedin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pole . That does not seem far . Yet Portland , Ore. , and Millinocket , Me. , are 3,000 miles from the North Pole ; so too Lyons , France , and Venice , Italy . <P> Three thousand miles is the ship or train distance between San Diego , Calif. , and Guayaquil , Ecuador ( where President-Elect Hoover was last week , see p. 10 ) , between Manhattan and Queenstown , Ireland , between Washington and San Francisco . Trains or ships join those traveled places in a few days . Getting to the trackless Poles takes months .
