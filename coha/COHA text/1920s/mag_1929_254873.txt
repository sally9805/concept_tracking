Into the Senate chamber shortly before noon one day last week limped William Scott Vare , Senator-suspect from Pennsylvania . His left side paralyzed , he leaned on a cane and the arm of his Philadelphia physician . <P> Into a much-disputed Senate seat-front row on the aisle-he gingerly lowered himself . On his florid face was a grim grin . He was sitting , if not " seated . ' ' in the Senate . <P> Fifteen minutes later , still grinning grimly , he arose and went limping out of the chamber , a Senator-reject from Pennsylvania . In the interval the Senate had refused ( 58 to 22 ) to accept him as a member because he and his friends had spent $785,000 to win the Republican nomination in the May 1926 primary. * To some Mr. Vare had been lynched , the Constitution shaken . To others the Senate had righteously purged itself of an evil influence . <P> Two days prior Mr. Vare had hobbled into the Senate chamber to make his first and last defense . Excerpts : <P> " The charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled upon the very edge of eternity. + . . . I never stole an election . . . . How unfair and unjust my accusers have been in attempting to twist mere clerical irregularities and technicalities into acts of political fraud and conspiracy ! . . . <P> Hushed and solemn was the Senate chamber when the final Vare vote came . In the gallery sat William Bauchop Wilson , onetime ( 1913-21 ) Secretary of Labor Democratic contestant for the Vare seat . . . . . Before the roll call was finished , Vare was hobbling out of the room . Blind Senator Schall of Minnesota groped his way to him , embraced him consolingly . In his ears rang bells for a roll call that would dismiss ( 66 to 15 ) the Wilson contest . <P> About the Senate flew reports that Governor John S. Fisher of Pennsylvania would appoint arch-lobbyist Joseph R. Grundy to the empty seat . Warned Senator Nye of North Dakota : " I give notice here and now that the appointee of Governor Fisher will need be one far removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seated . We can not damn one ill-smelling Pennsylvania machine without damning the other . " <P> At Harrisburg Governor Fisher retorted : ' ' I was shown a statement by a certain Senator better known for his voice than for his statesmanship . Well , all I say to that Senator who intends to oppose anything the Governor of Pennsylvania does is that he reminds me of an antimire* talking to a lot of jumbo elephants . . . . Somebody harbors a fear of a man named Grundy . Some of the criticisms have sounded like the malicious gossip of women . . . . So long as I am governor I intend to uphold our state and I would fail in my duty if I let the threat of any Senator dictate the selection . " <P> *In the same primary onetime Senator George Wharton Pepper spent $1,804,979 , onetime Governor Gifford Pinchot , $187,029 , vainly seeking the senatorial nomination . The Senate set a moral limit for campaign expenditures in 1922 when it seated Truman Hanly Newberry of Michigan , condemned his political use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apoplexy in August 1928 . <P> *Obsolete diminutive of ant , current only among elder Pennsylvania Dutch .
