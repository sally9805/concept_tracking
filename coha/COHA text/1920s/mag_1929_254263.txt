Great was the commotion in San Francisco harbor last week as the Dollar liner President Pierce glided in through the Golden Gate from the Orient . Whistles screamed . Bands blared . Flags flew . Warped into Pier 44 , she was quickly boarded by octogenarian Shipowner Robert Dollar who hurried about looking for an erect , spare , tropic-tanned man . He found him on deck , carrying a tightly rolled silk umbrella , and gave him a tremendous handshake which carried with it the welcome of the whole U.S. The browned voyager was none other than Henry Lewis Stimson , returning from the post of Governor-General of the Philippines to become number one man in President Hoover 's Cabinet . <P> With him was Mrs. Stimson , quiet , self-effacing , always loyal to her husband 's ascending career . As Mabel Wellington White of New Haven , Conn. , the new second lady of the land married Statesman Stimson in 1893 when he was just entering Elihu Root 's law firm and long before he became a statesman . In Manila last year she appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being second lady holds no social terrors for her . She was well-schooled in official society as the wife of President Taft 's Secretary of War . <P> About Statesman Stimson pressed newsgatherers . Said he with startling informal ity : " I absolutely refuse to shoot off my mouth about my new job until I see my new chief . " But he was by no means silent , for he had plenty to say about the Philippines . The proposition to impose duties upon sugar and other products from the Islands to the U. S. vexed him greatly . <P> He declaimed : " To place a tariff on such products would be following the steps of George III whose stamp tax on tea resulted in the American revolution ! " <P> He had escaped dengue fever , he said , and superstitiously rapped the wooden handle of his umbrella . Yes , his rheumatism was better , thanks to the tropic heat and tennis . Did he have apprehensions or misgivings about his high post ? Statesman Stimson drew in his chin and replied : <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall put on my rubber boots and wade through as well as I can . " <P> Toward dusk , the Stimsons boarded a Pullman to cross the continent . ... At Chicago they paused to breakfast at the Blackstone Hotel with Silas Strawn . <P> Statesman Stimson gave a second talk on the peace and contentment of the Philip pines . Some rude soul asked him about their independence . Ever diplomatic , Statesman Stimson replied : " Mr. Hoover 's election was received with great enthusiasm . " <P> In Manhattan , he paused briefly at his house and private office to arrange personal affairs and discuss the Philippine situation for a third time before pushing on to Washington where President Hoover waited to welcome him as a White Houseguest . The State Department was on its toes to greet its new Secretary . Nobody was more excited than " Eddie " Savoy , 74 , the messenger who has sat outside the door of more Secretaries of State than he cares to remember . He was appointed to his post in 1873 by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
