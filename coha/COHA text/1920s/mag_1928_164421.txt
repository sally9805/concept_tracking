A political thunderbolt , craftily prepared , was hurled by Prime Minister Baron Giichi Tanaka , last week , in an effort to weaken the Opposition parties by discrediting their extreme left wing , the Ronoto or Farmer-Laborites . The vital import of the Ronoto is that its two Deputies give the Opposition a theoretical plurality of two over the Government parties , in the newly elected Diet ( TIME , March 5 ) which will shortly assemble . Numbers : Opposition , including Ronoto , 228 ; Government , 226 ; and Independents , 11 . <P> First thunders against the Ronoto came , last week , in an announcement from the Ministry of Justice . This states that the Imperial Police had arrested in a secret raid 1,013 Opposition sympathizers of whom 26 were being held as Communists , on charges of attempting to subvert the state and throne . Followed at once , from the Ministry of Home Affairs , an order for the dissolution of the Ronoto , on the ground that it had become a Communist organization . In Japan , as everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal since 1923 . Suppressed along with the Ronoto , last week , were two sympathetic organizations : the League of Proletarian Youth and the Japanese Labor Council . <P> To substantiate the thunderbolt thus hurled by Prime Minister Tanaka , the Ministry of Justice next blazoned a propaganda leaflet allegedly seized during one of the police raids . Text : <P> " Parliament is nothing more than an organ to cheat the people . We must therefore form our own Parliament of laborers , farmers and the poorer classes . <P> " We must expose the crimes of capitalists and land owners . <P> " Our demands are : Wholesale revision of the election laws , abolition of laws aimed at the oppression of proletarians , opposition to war of imperialism , abolition of the monarchy . " <P> Further , the police claimed to have found proof that $30,000 was paid to Ronoto during the recent electoral campaign by the Third International , famed Soviet propaganda bureau . The " master mind " who from Moscow directed the alleged subversion was declared to be Sen Katayama , the expatriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale University . <P> Throughout Japan the Prime Minister 's thunderbolt took such potent effect that in several instances angry crowds mobbed Ronoto speakers . None the less impartial observers lent a sympathetic ear to stalwart , forthright Ikuo Oyama , Leader of the Ronoto . He swore that its members are not Communists but the unfortunate victims of a Government scheme to intimidate the Opposition .
