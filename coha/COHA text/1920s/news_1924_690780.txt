txt Farm financing has the same fundamental faults that apply to railroad financing , under the regime that lies made it almost Impossible to sell railroad stocks and brought forth a mortgage with every ' improvement . Expansion of farming operations in boom times is always accomplished through a heavy Increase of mortgages and fixed charges , One reason why deflation was so acute was that no liquid surplus had been accumulated by any considerable number of farmers. , Of course , this was the case with countless Industrial corporations the majority of which lost money In 1021 , and the total losses were greater than the grkIns of those that escaped . But a considerable ' number of the big corporations had a surplus to fall back on and many had been reducing their debt. - I3enjamln M. Anderson Jr. , economist of the Chase National bank , has made a most interesting study of farm financing from ft banker 's standpoint and has compared it to corporate operations . His study ought to be of great value to President Coolidge 's agricultural commission . It appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer is employing primitive methods not in keeping with the organized business of today .. As Mr. Anderson says : " Industry and commerce have learned a very much better financial technique than American agrieultve knows . By and large agriculture has really greater need for a financial policy which will enable it to meet emergencies , than industry has . Agriculture is at the mercy not merely of the markets , but also of the weather and the seasons . Steel will prosper regardless of the weather if only the markets . are right , Agriculture must face both contingencies . The life of the American farmer , even under good market conditions , is . notoriously an alternation of good times and bad , of good harvests or Lad , of times when money . Is relatively abundant and times when money is desperately scarce . ? Under ordinary conditions It is highly important-that the farmer should lay by liquid reserves in good years to enable him to be comfortable in bad years . In emergency times and times of general distress the possession of such liquid reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is otherwise inevitable . "
