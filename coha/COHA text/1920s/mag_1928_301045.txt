There is a statue of the late Carrie Nation in Wichita , Kan . There is a Mrs. Maude Wilson living in Kansas City , Mo. , 228 miles away . Mrs. Maude Wilson has an 18-year-old daughter who drank , last week , some gin in a speakeasy . When Mrs. Maude Wilson heard about this , she behaved not unlike the late Carrie Nation . Seizing a hatchet , she rushed to the speakeasy , swung high , swung low , shattered a mirror , windows , gin glasses . Barflies cheered her ; bartenders ran out into the alley . Police came , but they did not arrest her . Cried she : " I warned them bartenders not to sell liquor to my daughter . " <P> Two days later , at the hour of 4 a. m. , somebody threw half a brick and a salt shaker through the window of Mrs. Maude Wilson 's coffee shop . <P> In between the hatcheteering and the bricking , W. Harold Lane , chief of Federal Prohibition agents in Kansas City , let it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than there were legitimate bars before Prohibition . Federal and State officials put heads together for an enforcement drive .
