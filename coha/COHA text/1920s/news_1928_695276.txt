txt The credit problem raised by the rapidly mounting total of loans made by corporations on stock and bond . collateral was attacked from two angles at a special meeting of the New York Clearing House Association yesterday . The association received from its Clearing House Committee , headed by Seward Prosser , chairman of the board of the Bank , ers Trust Company , a set of proposals that would increase the banks ' charge for placing corporations ' funds in the loan market and also place a minimum of $100,000 on the size of such loans to be handled . These proposals will be passed on by the association at another special meeting today . At . the same time , the Clearing 1 House Committee , which has power to change interest rates on deposits without official ratification by the association as a whole , announced that , effective on next Monday , a general increase will take place in interest rates to be paid depositors . by Clearing House member banks . Under the Clearing House Committee 's plan to be acted on today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 per cent . for hadling street loans for the account of others than banks or bankers . This wolud take the place of the present charge of 5 per cent , of the mount earned in interest on the loans . It is proposed that the new charge go into effect on Sept. 1 . It is regarded as assured that the proposals will be adopted . Under the Clearing House rules , such a plan must be submitted at one meeting and acted upon at another . The Clearing House Committee , however , has the power to act on its own initiative on deposit rate changes . New Rates on Deposits . The announcement concerning interest rates , signed by Mr. Prosser and by Clarence E. Bacon , manager of the Clearing House , fixed the new rates on certificates of deposit payable within thirty days from date of issue , on certificates of deposit payable within thirty days from demand , on credit balances payable on demand and on credit balances payable within thirty days from demand , at 2 per cent . to banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2l per cent . to mutual savings banks and 21%s per cent . to others . On certificates of deposit payable on or after thirty days from the date of issue or demand , a rate of 31 , per cent . will be paid . This schedule represents an advance of IA of 1 per cent . in the interest to be paid to out-of-town banks on deposits here ; an advance of 3 of 1 per cent . on commercial accounts and an advance of 1 per cent . on deposits for thirty days or longer . There was a division of opinion in banking circles yesterday over the effectiveness of the plans to reduce the loans made by corporations . The fact that Sept. 1 was chosen as the effective date of the new charge for placing loans indicated to many that the intervening period of virtually a month would see the situation adjust itself . Executives of several of the large Wall Street banks said that a reduction of % of 1 per cent . in the yield obtained by corporations probably would not influence them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their funds seem advisable to them . The increased charge , together with the higher interest rates to be paid by the banks , however , will lessen the differential between the earnings available on deposits and those obtainable in the Street loan market and is expected to have some effect on the situation . The increase in interest rates was considered a natural step in the movement to induce the corporations to withdraw as lenders . It was argued that it was not exactly fair to expect the corporations to withdraw without offering them something in return . Also . the rate on deposits has been lagging behind the general trend in money rates for most of this year . Bankers Doubtful of Results . Although officials of the Clearing House had no comment to make , other bankers discussing the situation after the new measures had been announced said they could see no specific way in which the credit trends presented by the corporate loan ace ) unt could be corrected and that it would work itself out of its own accord . Discussing the larger . question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of more than $500,000,000 of gold by this country this year was making logically for higher money rates and that the country must get used to a different credit outlook from the one that had prevailed for the last few years . Under heavy inflow of gold from abroad in 1922. 1923 and 1924 , money rates had sank to low levels and a so-called " borrowers ' market " had developed . This now has been changed . Attention was further centred on the brokers " uan situation by a visit to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York yesterday made by Roy A. Young . Governor of the Federal Re . serve Board . Mr. Young attended the meeting of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank and is understood to have met other bankers here . ft was said at the bank , however , that Mr. Young merely had dropped in here for an inspection on his way to Washington from a yr .1 1r/ ip .

In the same period the brokers ' loans made . b31 the New York City ; banks for their own account have decreased from $1,109,556,000 to $928,466,000 . The main concern in banking cir-cles over the growth in loans made by corporations has been that they have been outside of control or regulation by the banks and are subject to withdrawals which cause flurries in money rates . The advent of the Autumnal demands for funds for commercial purposes , with firm rates indicated , made it advisable , it was believed , to avoid delay in seeking a solution .
