txt Plan of leading producers to reduce Califorma crude oil yield , effective April 1 . to at least the average yield in 1928. is one of the most important steps yet taken in the general program to reduce the country 's crude oil production California operations have substituted direct action  --  their plan is to shut in production ? for their previous efforts to cut production by restricting the flow of natural gas . The whole plan of the industry is to reduce domestic yield in the United States to the average of last year , on April 1 , 1928 , which would require shutting in for the United States of 178 000 barrels a day . Without California taking definite steps to reduce her yield , the whole plan would be impotent . This is because C.lifornia 's excess over 1928 average production amounts to 157,000 barrels daily . It represents some 80 , - ; - of the total " excess " of the country over the April 1 . 1928. figure . Oklahoma Procedure Followed California operators are now attacking the overproduction problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its yield . This is through the appointment of an umpire to make the plan effective and arbitrate all differences , and a committee to work in conjunction with the umpire in formulating the method by which the reduction is to be brought about . The definite plan was pieced together by the Pacific Coast Regional Committee on Conservation , named by the American Petroleum Institute . This committee is headed by Kenneth R. Kingsbury , president of the Standard Oil of California , the largest producer in the state , and has members from the other leading producers . This regional body went a long way toward formulating the plan by deciding upon reductions . ranging from 8 , i , to in daily yields of all flush producing districts of the state . Older areas , likewise , are to have their yields reduced . The task of carrying out the work was passed on to the sub-committee , headed by Lionel Barneson. president of the General Petroleum Co. , which will coopers with the nmpire . California Key State in Plan if California is able to carry through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutting In as directed . It will be the biggest step forward in the nadustry 's effort to extract itself from the mire of overproduction . California is the vital point in the whole program . for its production had shown the greatest increase . With Oklahoma already having reduced its production by some 60.000 barrels a day and now below the 1928 average , it remains for Texas to bring clown its yield . It Is estimated that the Lone Star state is producing about 82,000 barrels a day more than the average last Car Program endorsed by the California operators follows the recent meeting of regional committees at Houston . Texas . called to bring about lower crude yield . The step taken by California probably will be followed by Texas operators who ha ? e a much smaller amount of crude to shut in .

Several meetings have been held in Los Angeles during the past two weeks between California operators and committees of the A. P. I. , looking to stabilization of production In various producing states .
