txt Governor-elect Nathan L. Miller , in his first public utterance since his election , outlined last night at the 152d annual dinner of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York at the Waldorf some of the general policies which , he said , would govern some of the aspects of his administration . The Governor-elect appealed for the aid of business men In his administration , saying he wished something more than advice from them and that he intended to call upon some of the men present last night for " patriotic , unselfish service . " lie bespoke the assistance of the new State Administration in the solving of the city 's local problems , and declared that , while he believed in a large measure of home rule , the public interest must be served , even if the State were obliged to take action . He asserted his belief in the idea that public officials should try to give their attention to the business of government rather than to the governing of private business . " I think the rapid transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governorelect said . " Another grave problem of New York City 1$ the port problem . " I may say that I believe in the maximum exercise . of the power of home rule , but to justify that maximum , the powers delegated by the State to the munleipality must be ext  --  ised in the ruhlic interest . We need to have these problems studied , precisely as I take it tile port problem has been studied . We need to find out what action needs to be taken and then we need to see that that action is taken . I want to say that . I am In favor of securing action , and if it can not be secured in one way , then I am in favor of Leelting ether ways to secure it . " " I favor securing action . I believe that the State must do everything possible to co  --  operate with the local government , but that the public interest must be served . If action can not be secured in one way , then I am in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that any preconceived notion on the Part of any one should stand in the way of that aelutIon . " Some of the 411uner guests took the Governor-elect 's allusions to attempts of Public officials to govern private business , coupled with the references to the transit situation and the " preconceived notions " of public officials as a direct reference to the Hylan administration , and Mr. Miller 's further declaration that the State , ? tinder his administration , would see that the public interest should be servel " as a possible warning to the Mayor that as Governor , Mr. Miner would use any power delegated to hint to secure that end , whatever clash it involved with the City Government . Comes to Appeal for Help . The Governor-elect declared at the outset of his speech that , mindful . as he was of tile responsibilities and difficulties that were soon to confront him , he had come to appeal to the members of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York for help . " We are in the habit , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election as a victory of a party . Times are too serious , the problems are too compisx and too difficult , and , indeed , party lines are too much broken to refer to the result as a party victory . Instead of winning a victory , the Republican Party has assumed a great responsibility . " The ' seriousness of the times emphasizes the truth that party govern- ment must be a government solely in the public- interest . For a number of years prior to the war the business men of the country have been withdrawing more and more from public activities . Men of talent were seeking business rather than public activities . The war taught us a lesson of service . " We are entering upon a new era . It ' rests ' with the present generation to decide which it shall be -- -c- , 00d or ill . Moral forces are going to make for the betterment of the world and the progress of humanity , and , notwithstanding the present uncertainty of international , relations , I believe that the Government will try principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who expect to enjoy the blessings of an ordered government must he willing to serve their Government and to render unselfish public service . I want to say that as Governor of this State I propose to appeal to that spirit for assistance . 1 propose to appeal to men like those whom 1 am now addressing to seek those who can render public service , rather than those who are anxious to do so . 1 intend to give some of you the opportunity of rendering public service . " Something has been said about propaganda . I think we have too many civic organizations engaged in propaganda , most of which leads to harmful results . The times require something more than advice . We want men.who are willing to render service . " I think that some of the causes of discontent and unrest would he remov  --  d by the closer attention of public officials to the business of government , rather than to attempt to govern private business . " The speakers . besides Governor-elect Miller , were Sir Auckland Geddes , the British Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin P. Kingsley , President of the Chamber , /was toastmaster . Two PaCts Before Nation . " There are only two possible paths before each nation at a time of world change like this , " the Ambassador said . " It can co-operate with its fellows and , maintaining peace and fellowship between itself and them , devote its energies to the solution of its internal problems . Alternatively , it can ' follow the path that Germany followed in the years before 1914 , throw the blame for its internal difficulties upon the other nations of the world and drift toward war which some day will look and will be-assumed to be inevitable . I know of no third road which any State can tread . " Asserting that invention was continually reducing the time-size of the world . Sir Auckland asserted that " every day that passes makes the insulation of national thought and the isolation of national activity more truly impossible . " " The world waits for an answer to the question ' Are the I3ritIsh-American contacts to be fair , and friendly , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to la. marked by suspicion , political jealousy and schemings to establish exclusive eronomie spheres : ' " the Ambassador sail . " If it is to be the first . then the future is bright . There is no problem which in friendly cooperation we can not solve . If it were to he the second , sadness would possess tue . The choice is yours . The British Empire offers America friendship . "
