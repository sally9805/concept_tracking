When a play has been publicly suppressed by Great Britain 's Lord Chamberlain , it can still be privately performed before a " subscription audience . " Last week such an audience of smart Londoners assembled unblushingly , rustling with anticipation , to see sardonic Alfred Savoir 's suppressed drama The Lion Tamer or How the Englishman Was Eaten . <P> Two hours later the " subscription audience " went home nauseated , well punished for their peeping-tommery . The piece had been all about an Englishman who morbidly followed a French circus for years , hoping to see the lion eat the trainer . By way of grisly climax the French trainer , vexed , flung the Englishman into the lion 's cage , whereupon the stage was darkened and awful groans , snarls and tearing sounds betokened that the Englishman was being eaten . <P> Strongest stomached English sophisticates opined that for once the Lord Chamberlain had suppressed wisely and aright .
