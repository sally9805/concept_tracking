The Tariff Commission has six members . Six is a good number for a poker game , but for a deliberative body it has its disadvantages . Ever and anon , the Board divides against itself-three and three . A short time ago , it so divided against itself on the question of whether a Commissioner might sit in the consideration of a case involving a commodity in which he himself had business interests . The quarrel dragged on . <P> Congress came to the . Commission 's aid , passed a law against a Commissioner participating in a case in which he or his immediate relatives had a direct pecuniary interest . <P> Apparently the matter was settled . Not so . The Commission undertook the investigation of the tariff on butter . Immediately three disgusted members announced that they could not take part in the proceedings because they owned farms on which cows were kept . The other three members grew very angry . <P> Together all six took their quarrel to the President . He referred them all to Comptroller General McCarl . Mr. McCarl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that the relatives in the forbidden group were " father , mother , children , brothers and sisters of husband or wife . " He held that " direct pecuniary interest " meant " an interest upon which action in the tariff-matter under consideration would be immediately , rather than remotely , reflected . " <P> It is not unlikely that the six Commissioners will divide-three against three-on the question of how Mr. McCarl should be interpreted .
