Citizens of the U. S. who were induced to buy $6,000,000 worth of " Irish Liberty Loan Bonds , " eight years ago , by famed " President " Eamon de Valera of " The Irish Republic , " can get back a portion of their money . <P> <P> They may get it at No. 117 Liberty Street ; Manhattan , by order of New York State Supreme Court Justice Curtis A. Peters . Last week Justice Peters said that $2,600,000 of the original $6,000,000 remains unclaimed in the hands of U. S. receivers of the defunct " Irish Republic . " But so many Irish patriots have displayed a reluctance to claim their share , that those who do file claims before the closing date for such applications ( Dec. 31 , 1928 ) may find themselves reimbursed almost in full .
