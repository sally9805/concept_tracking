The Rubber Exchange in Manhattan ( Francis R. Henderson , President ) , is a quiet-looking place . The architecture is sort of Dutch , about as Dutch as the Stock Exchange is Greek : a burgomaster 's mansion , not the temple of a relentless cult . The quiet winding stretches of South William Street have just enough of Amsterdam 's canals to make the visiting Dutch rubber trader homesick . The dark-red bricks are so well woven together , the boxes of flowers on the window ledges are so neatly kept , the whole place is so clean-it is a bit of Holland low-country snuggling at the base of Manhattan peaks . <P> Last week rubber bounded-down , down . At the Rubber Exchange there was pandemonium in miniature likeness of the Stock Exchange . Rubber dropped to new low records for the history of the two-year-old exchange . Trading was in tremendous volume , pace of execution was terrific , collars wilted and voices hoarsened for the first time in the life of the New York rubber broker . Brokers sold 20,277 long tons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange seat was sold for a new high record : $6,600 . A cablegram from London was responsible for the crash .

S. correspondents and their papers were able to scoop London by almost 24 hours . This caused a loss to British rubber men which London Rubber Magnate Arthur Anthony Baumann estimated at 7,000,000 . He added caustically , " 10 Downing Street the Prime Minister 's residence is really unfit to govern the Empire . " <P> *The unit of trading on the Rubber Exchange .
