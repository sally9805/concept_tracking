txt Whether the Interborough Rapid Transit Company will be able to begin collecting a 7-cent fare on its subway and elevated lines in the near future , possibly within the next week or ten days , now rests with the Federal statutory court , consisting of Circuit Judge Martin T. Manton and District Judges William Bondy and John C. Knox . These Judges heard the closing arguments yesterday afternoon for and against the company 's application for a temporary injunction preventing the city and the Transit Commission from interfering with the collection of a higher fare . Decision was reserved after Samuel Untermyer , special counsel for the Transit Commission , and Charles L. Craig , special counsel for the city , had attacked the application , mainly on the ground that the 5-cent fare was protected by an inviolable contract . William L. Ransom , special counsel for the Interborough , made a reply argument . The ' Court allowed the company until Wednesday to reply to allegatlerisin Mr. Craig 's answer , a bulky volume of 390 pages , incorporating the counterclaim authorized last Thursday 0.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breaking its contract with the city and asks that the contract be annulled and the city allowed . to repossess its property . In Mr. Craig 's answer and an accompanying brief the charge is made that the Interborough " filched " millions from the city by illegally withholding earnings which should have been applied to the city 's account , and swelled initial construction costs by about $30,000,000 through willful delay in starting work under the dual contracts . Combats City 's Power . The legal battle yesterday centred about the question of whether or not the Legislature through various enactments since 1907 , when the Public Service Commission was estab= lished , had delegated irrevocably to the city the rate making power which both Mr. Untermyer and Mr. Craig insisted had been exercised in the March 19 , 1913 , contract fixing the fare at 5 cents . For the company Mr. Ransom declared that the Legislature had merely given to the city the right to fix a fare by contract , subject to State regulation through the Transit Commission . Furthermore , he contended , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could not do so legally under the decisions in this State . The opposite view was stressed by Mr. Untermyer and Mr. Craig , both of whom insisted that the contract was invincible and made under delegation of legislative power by special statute  --  namely , the Rapid Transit act of 1921 . This being so , they contended , no confiscation was possible and no rate case existed for the statutory court to consider . All three Judges interrupted Mr. Untermyer and Mr. Craig frequently and indicated by their questions that they considered this point a vital one . At the conclusion of arguments no indication was given by the court as to when its decision would be made , but the score or so , of lawyers representing the litigants agreed that in view of the voluminous pleadings and the many authorities to be checked , it was unlikely that a decision would be handed down in less than a week or ten days . Call Complaint Dishonest . The Interborough 's original complaint was assailed by the city and the Transit Commission as " dis- honest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accused of suppressing material facts which would have caused the refusal of the United States Courts to take original jurisdiction . " If we had had an honest complaint here , " Mr. Untermyer declared , " we could have settled this question once and for all on a motion to dismiss . " " If this complaint had been an honest one , had included the entire contract with the city and the lease from the Manhattan Elevated to the Interborough , " Mr. Craig asserted , " the company would have been out of court the minute it walked in . " It is Mr. Craig 's contention that inasmuch as the Interborough is in the Federal courts , although on a false complaint , the city is now in a position to have its counterclaim considered there as a separate action , following a dismissal of the Interborough suit , even though a suit based upon the counterclaim could not have been brought by the city in that tribunal independently . Mr. Craig expects , at some date in the the proceedings , to seek a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board . A point which cropped up yesterday afternoon in the questions asked by members of the court concerned the status of the Transit Commission as a rate regulating body . Mr. Untermyer contended in his argument that it had no jurisdiction to regulate rates under the Rapid Transit act and insisted that its orders for platform extensions and other - improvements by the Interborough were promulgated as the city 's protector under Contract 3 . In his reply argument , Mr. Ransom pointed out that for years the Transit Commission and its predecessor in authority , the Public Service Cornmission. , had issued such orders avowedly ? under provisions of the Public Service Law . Judge Knox , who yesterday , for the first time since the case came before the statutory court , took a part in the questioning of counsel , inquired into this phase of the . Transit Commission 's activities . Mr. Untermyer contended that the Transit Commission was the champion of the city alone and could not gave relief to the Interborough even if asked to do so . Judge Manton then asked whether it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulating and quasi-judicial body was similar to that of Federal commissions , such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission . " In any event , " Mr. Untermyer declared , " failure by the Transit Commission to act upon the company 's ' etition is not confiscation . " Judge Bondy. who took an active part in colloquies with counsel , declared several times in the argument that the law of the case appeared clear and that the sole question appeared to be one of its application to facts . In this connection , he indicated , the vital factor appeared to be whether or not the Legislature had irrevocably delegated to the city the power of making rates by contract with the company . The city 's answer , filed by Mr. Craig , included a complete and detailed history of the dealings between the city and the Interborough , dating back to 1894 and incorporating Contract 3 . Under the contract , Mr. Craig maintained , the Interborough received assurance of an annual income of $6,335.000 for forty-nine years , as well as other considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for initial equipment and operating cost and other items . The company , he contended , was in no different position than that of a tired operator working for a fixed fee . " As a matter of fact , " Judge Manton queried , " was n't this a joint venture between the city and the com-pany ? " The presiding Judge had already raised the same point during Mr. Untermyer 's argument and at that time it was said that the Court of Appeals had decided that the relation was one of landlord and tenant . He assured counsel that the opinion of the State tribunal was " respected " by the Federal courts but intimated that the question was still open . Mr. Craig 's reply to the query was to point out that the city had nothing to gain from the contract and the Interborough 's intention in entering into it was to receive an ironclad guarantee of a fixed yearly income from earnings before the city got a cent . " But the contract provides for a 50-50 division of profits over and above all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract shows a desire by the city to share in the profits . " " A hope , rather , " Mr. Craig said . " At any rate it 's in the contract , " was Judge Manton 's reply . Mr. Craig then traced the long history of legislation affecting the city 's transit situation and contended that all control of rate making had been allotted to the city free from interference by either the Legislature or the Transit Commission . The question , he insisted , was already res judicata in this State because of the suit of the Admiral Realty Corporation testing the validity of the contract . Tins action , he charged , was instigated by the company shortly after Contract 3 was signed . " The bill introduced by Senator Wagner in 1912 , amending the act of 1909 , " Mr. Craig continued , " shows that the Legislature intended to relinquish all control of fares to the city . " " That 's the question . " Judge Bondy interjected . " It 's the crux of this case . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case to decide , " Mr. Craig replied . " The intention seems more than clear . " Judges Manton and Knox interrupted Mr. Craig again when he asserted that the only real investment in the subways was that of city funds and that there could be no confiscation of public property . He was reminded from the bench that the Federal statute covering rate cases applied to a fair return on " all property used in the service " without mention of whether it was public or private . Mr. Craig declared that there was no decision . in the ' case books covering a situation in which the investment ? was one of public funds . Here Judge Manton again directed counsel 's attention to the fact that the contract between the city and the Interborough mentioned a division of profits over and above prior charges . " You have no power to compel the city to charge a self-sustaining rate , " Mr. Craig retorted . " The city may pay all ? charges out of taxes if it so desires . " Ransom 's Reply Argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crux of this situation is whether or not the Legislature has delegated its rate-making power to the city , " Mr. Ransom declared , summing up his reply argument " But we go further and say tha under the decisions it has no power to take such a step . ? It can not delegate its police powers . Its regulatory powers enter and become a part of every contract for fare regulation which the city of New York may make under existing laws . " The city 's answer alleges that the Interborough deliberately failed to provide plans for track alignments and connections and so delayed the operation of the lease under contract 3 as to cause the city the loss of millions of dollars . It charges also that at least $5,000,000 was improperly and illegally withheld from the city 's share Of revenue under the contract . " Thus the Interborough , " the city 's brief adds , " not only filched from the city the earnings to which it was entitled from and after Jan. 1 , 1917 , but it inflated the costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars , the aggregate of which can not now be stated with precision , but must be at least $30,000,000 . The precise facts will be the subjects of proof upon the trial of the counter-claim of this defendant . " A decision upholding the contract on the ground of irrevocable delegation of legislative power to fix fares will leave the company either an appeal directly to the United States Supreme Court or recourse to State tribunals.
