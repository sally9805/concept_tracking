The final finger at the end of the Law 's long arm in Massachusetts , New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania is a tall gaunt man named Robert G. Elliott , official executioner for those four States . After society had finally decided it must take the lives of Communists Sacco &; Vanzetti last summer , it was Executioner Elliott who threw the electric switch . He also killed Ruth Snyder , Judd Gray , and over 100 less famed criminals . When he took up his profession in 1926 he tried to keep it secret . But his name leaked out after a year . He has been uneasy ever since . <P> Mr. Elliott 's house is in a place called Dunton , a drab quarter of the Borough of Queens , N. Y. One night last week , an hour past midnight , a bulky object lying on the porch of the Elliott house detonated with a roar of which the magnitude befitted the object of its protest . This object was not Robert G. Elliott or his wife and two children , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood was shaken awake , showered and riddled with flying ragged slugs and chunks of metal . The front of the Elliott house yawned wretchedly in the night . People stumbled down the street to see . The police riot squad swept up . All yammered and exclaimed over the explosion , little realizing the full justice of its result . Robert G. Elliott , Mrs. Elliott and their children all came out of their house unhurt . <P> Police tried to trace a Red motor car .
