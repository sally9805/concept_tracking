txt Miss Cordie Harvey . a guest of the Hotel Martinique , was chloroformed and robbed late Saturday night of $1,600 of jewelry and cash and escaped death from the anesthetic because she was choked by one of the two men who robbed her . In a sleepless day and night search for three successive days she helped bring about the arrest of the two men early yesterday morning . They confessed , the police said . Miss Harvey , who is 25 years old , slight and pretty , lives at Rhodell , Raleigh County , W. Va . ? She , was said to be the daughter of a coal mine operator . She slept yesterday for the first time since Saturday morning while the two robbers confessed and were held for arraignment today iu the Jefferson Market court . They . said they were Edward Kelly . 22 years old , and Paul Jefferies , 23 , both waiters , and gave their addresses as 136 Henry Street . Miss Harvey had been a guest at the Martinique , an annex of the Hotel MeAlpin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early Sunday morning employes of the hotel heard groans behind the door of a room on an upper floor . They opened it and found Miss Harvey lying on the bed , partly conscious . The room was not her own , and when she was revived by the hotel physician she said she had been persuaded to go there ? to meet a " Mr. and Mrs. Bentley " and while there had been drugged , choked and robbed by two men . She ' said they had taken a platinum ring set with eighteen small diamonds and four sapphires worth $1,125 ; a gold and platinum ring worth $250 ; a white gold ring set with chip diamonds worth $100 , a white gold wrist watch worth $50 , a string of pearl beads worth $75 and $20 in cash . Persuaded to Visit Room . Miss Harvey said she had been persuaded to go to the room by a man who had befriended her on the day of her arrival when she had asked him for directions to the City Hall Postoffice . She had met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times had " run across him " there and in restaurants on Broadway . He had attempted to be ? friendly , but she did not encourage him until last Saturday night . when she was seated ' in the hotel and he approached , saying he had two friends , " Mr. and Mrs. Bentley of New Orleans , " who wanted to make a party of four to go out . He ventured the suggestion , with a show of . diffidence ; that if she , a stranger like himself , was lonely as he was it would be a pleasant way to spend the remainder ' of the evening in good company . Miss . Harvey . said she was hesitant , but eventually agreed to join the party . The man went , she said , to telephone his friends and returned , saying M.S. ' Behtley was dressing and wanted her to come upstairs . They arrived in the room . " Mrs. Bentley " was not hi sight , but there ' were women 's garments on the bed and a man there who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilette in the bathroom and would be out immediately . But there was something in the two men 's behaivor which made Miss Harvey suspicious . Also . she heard no sound from the bathroom . And while she waited , with the men making conversation about a " killing " at the races , she observed them carefully . Presently one of the men remarked that it was close in the room . He got up as if to open the window and suddenly Miss Harvey felt herself caught in the other man 's grasp and was made ill by the fumes of chloroform pressed to her +nose with a cloth . ' Seized and Robbed of Gems . She had no time to scfearn. ? The second man took her by the throat 1 and the two of them threw her on ) the bed , where , while one clutched at her throat , the other started pulling off her rings and wrist watch . In the excitement the robbers apparently overlooked the necklace , but the man clutching at her throat pulled at it just as Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried the second man , " you do n't have to choke her to get that necklace . " These , Miss Harvey said , were the last words she heard until the hotel employes came into the room several hours later . A. G. Dennison , chief or the and Martinique detectives , was called from his home to take charge of the case . He reported it directly to Inspector Coughlin and asked Miss Harvey , who was still weak from the effects of the chloroform and the excitement , if she could describe the men . He said yesterday that the hotel physician bad said that she would have probably have died from the effects of the chloroform had not the robbers choked her and prevented her from breathing , but , weak as she was , " gamely promised to see the thing through to the concert . " " She is a remarkable young wo ? man , " said Dennison . " I asked Inspector Coughlin for Detective George to help me. and we could n't have done anything without Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , not only as to their general appearance , but also as to their clothing , even to the stripes on their socks , and , with one of the men  --  Kelly  --  to a defect in his teeth . " The room had been taken in the name of Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Bentley of New Orleans , but none of the employes of the hotel saw a woman with the , inan who signed the register  --  Kelly . " We found in the room a blue slip of paper , a pass to ' B. F. Moss 's Broadway Theatre , made out in blank . We thought this was a clue , - and we talked to more than twenty men to whom such passes had been issued , . but when Miss Harvey saw them none was either of the men we were looking for . " But first we took her down to Police Headquarters and examined thousands of photographs of criminals . None was the picture of either man . Miss Harvey had described both so well that we had pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she said she would . stay with us while we started a search of the city . Since she recalled ' that they had spoken of the races , ' we thought they might be track followers . We disguised her as best we could and on Monday we stationed ourselves at the track train gate in the Pennsylvania Station , hoping we might patch a glimpse of the men ' going to the races . This developed nothing ; " On Monday night Miss Harvey recalled that the . man who had persuaded her to . go . upstairs had been seated near her in a Broadway restaurant and had been spoken to by a waiter who apparently knew him . We persuaded her to go alone to this waiter , pretend she was the man 's sweetheart and try to learn where he lived . She did , and we got the address of . a Tenderloin speakeasy which is the hangout of waiters . Both the prisoners , we learned , were waiters . " But we did n't find our man there . We hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until late Tuesday night . Then , while walking through West Fortyfifth Street , with Miss Harvey between and myself , I saw a man who fitted perfectly the description she had given us of Bentley . I nudged her and nodded at the man . She gasped and nodded , and and I grabbed him . " He had the wrist watch on him . He tried to chuck it in the waste basket of the hotel room where we questioned him , but I saw him . We found two pawn tickets on him for two other pieces of jewelry . He confessed , gave us an address and with Miss Harvey 's help we found the other man  --  Jeffries ? on Eighth Avenue between Forty-eighth and Fortyninth Street . She picked him in a crowd . " Jefferies confessed to Inspector Coughlin and said he had sold two rings to " a man at Broadway and Forty-second Street " for $107 . Kelly said he bought the chloroform in Liggett 's drug store at Eighth Avenue and Thirty-fourth Street a half hour before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale , it was said , identified him . Neither Jefferies nor Kelly had a police record , and each insisted that this was the first time he was arrested . Nevertheless they were questioned about the robbery of women in apartments here during the past five years . They were questioned parIticularly about their movements on March 15 , 1923 , when Dorothy King was suffocated with chloroform in her apartment at 144 West Fifty-seventh Street and robbed of $15,000 in jewelry and a fur coat . Later Deputy Inspector Arthur A. Carey said they satisfied him they were not implicated in this crime .
