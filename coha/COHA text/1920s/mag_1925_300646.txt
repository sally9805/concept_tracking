There was not a whisper in the gallery . They had it all to themselves . Outside , the grey skies of Northamptonshire cast a twilight about the old house , blurring the trees that lined the avenue up which no one came . Everyone else , indeed , had gone long ago , but still they stayed-beauties , wits , gallants , a decent sheet pulled over the face of each in the silence and shadow of the voiceless gallery . <P> It is not probable that they knew that their owner , Earl Spencer , had died ; but even if they did , they could not have understood . Death , for those who derive their being from the paint of Master Artists , is a phenomenon hardly less comprehensible than change . Yet there was the fact , the Earl was dead and change was upon them . All this in 1922 . <P> Last week , came the announcement that Duveen Bros. , famed London dealers , had bought six of them-three Reynoldses , a Gainsborough , a Van Dyke , a Frans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be shipped to the U.

She stands against a marble balustrade , a flight of steps at her feet leading to a formal park . Her dress is cream colored , her coif , built up like a Chestertonian paragraph , is starred with pearls , garnished with plumes of red and grey ; from her right arm depends a gauzy scarf . Walpole wrote of her : " She effaces all without being a beauty , but her youthful figure , lively modesty and modest familiarity make her a prodigy . " The portrait was painted at the time of her wedding . Seven years later , she sat to Gainsborough , and his portrait of her shows a woman whose face had taken on a pensive cast and her body a buxom rotundity-not quite so buxom , on the tactful canvas , as her contemporaries are known to have found her. + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portrait of a Man-a Cavalier in a rakish hat , white ruff , glancing over his shoulder . Hals reproduced this gentleman 's debonair carriage , reproduced also , in delicate red , the warts that marred his countenance . <P> Van Dyke 's Daedalus and Icarus betrays the influence of Rubens . The choice of subject , the richness of hues , the transparency of the shadows , all are in the Rubens tradition . Reynolds has two other canvases in this collection-one of Lady Spencer and her son Viscount Althorp , playing with a black and white cocker-spaniel ; one of the Marchioness Camden , seated with a naively histrionic air , upon the ground . <P> * This price was later spoken of as " grossly exaggerated .
