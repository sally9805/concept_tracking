There is a peculiar expression which is seen on the faces of people pitching horseshoes . It is an expression dreamy yet intense , a good deal like that worn by anyone who is composing poetry or worrying about his digestion . This was the expression which through a warm afternoon last week in St. Petersburg , Fla. , appeared on the face of Charles C. Davis of Columbus , Ohio , and was not noticed because it also appeared on the face of his opponent , a young man named Bert Duryee of Wichita , Kan . Without taking off his cracked and faded straw hat Davis tossed horseshoes at an iron stake driven into the ground 40 feet from where he stood . Duryee was not quite so calm ; the crowd seemed to bother him and before he got going Davis had a lead of nearly 20 points which he held to the end of the game , beating Duryee 50 to 30 , and so winning a diamond studded medal , $300 , and , for the third time in succession , the horseshoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitching developed in imitation of the more courtly game of quoits . Perhaps , so far as it concerns the codification of horseshoe pitching as a formal sport , this is true , but it is certain that in the beginning quoits developed out of horseshoe pitching . Followers of both games argue the question at great length . Horseshoe pitchers point out that , next to ringing church bells , throwing horseshoes was the sin which most tempted the tinker , John Bunyon , before God was made manifest to him . Now there are pitching courts in the public parks of most big cities . Quiet , sunburned old men throw horseshoes in the yards of Florida hotels . They are the ones who like the game best , but the young men are the champions . The headquarters of the National Horseshoe Pitchers Association is in Akron , Ohio . A horseshoe pitcher uses two horseshoes , each weighing 2 Ibs . He tosses them at an iron stake 40 ft. away , protruding 8 in. above a bed of potters clay . Then his opponent does likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ; a ringer 3 points ; a double ringer 6 points . The first player to score 50 points wins the game . In championship matches , calipers and a straight edge are used to determine accurately which horseshoe is nearest the stake . But in casual bouts a player often shouts : " My horseshoe is two fingers nearer than yours . "
