Smart Parisian children are accustomed to behold at the Chatelet Theatre entrancing " fairy spectacles " called feriques . Last week , however , this famed theatre-for-tiny-tots was taken over by Actor-Manager Sacha Guitry , who is usually to be found co-starring with his wife , Mile . Yvonne Printemps , in Paris ' latest and most urbanely naughty hit . To the Chatelet tripped and strode , last week , Tout Paris to applaud what one critic called " the boyish dignity and so entrancing innocence de notre cher Lindbergh ! " <P> Generously the great Actor-Manager Sacha Guitry provided for his choosey feminine patrons two Lindberghs-Voila ! Also he entitled his piece Charles Lindbergh-A Heroic Melodrama . Finally , with the cunning of a master dramatist , he supplied love interest-without offending that large section of French womanhood to whom Le Colonel is attractive chiefly as a symbol of masculine chastity . <P> Act One reveals Colonel Lindbergh hearkening sympathetically to a beauteous young U. S. girl who passionately loves-a Frenchman . Unfortunately her U. S. father thinks that all Frenchmen are " lousy , dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyish dignity and innocence Le Colonel decides to span the Atlantic , uniting citizens of France and the U. S. by a common bond of heroism , and thus powerfully inducing the U. S. father to let his daughter marry the Frenchman . <P> Two highly melodramatic scenes show the take-off of Lindbergh from Roosevelt Field and his landing at Le Bourget . In both the technical staff of the Chatelet Theatre , famed specialists in scenic effects , nobly acquit themselves . <P> Thus far the audience sees only Lindbergh Number One , played by M. Armand Chatraine , a youth who was thought by all his friends to resemble the Colonel at the time of Lindbergh 's actual landing in France ( TIME , May 30 , 1927 ) . <P> The smash-finish of the play brings on Lindbergh Number Two , played by M. Pierre Tristan , who never realized that he resembled the Colonel until a Paris mob recently descended upon him ( TIME , Oct. 1 ) and bore him shoulder high , under the impression that the real Lindbergh had slipped back to Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was shrewdly introduced by Playwright Guitry as his final , terrific curtain scene . <P> The other Parisian theatrical event of the week was the appearance of M. Nikita Balieff 's famed Russian Bat Theatre , the Chauve-Souris in French for the first time . Heretofore , the troupe has played exclusively in Russian , with M. Balieff introducing each act in excruciating pidgin-English , French , German , or Italian .
