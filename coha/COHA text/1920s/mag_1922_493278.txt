Lloyd George Mr. Lloyd George , by E. T. Raymond . New York : The George H. Doran Company . $3.00 . IT is still too early for anyone to be able than a fraction of the truth about Lloyd great deal of excavation remains to be done , ters , stories , diaries of the people closest to him must come to light before we can have a full-length portrait of him , a Portrait sure to be one of the most curious in history . Ilat in the meantime Mr. Raymond can afford to be proud af the thorough and revealing job he has done with the Material now at hand . It is a solid , capable piece of work , illuminated by a sober irony , unpretentious yet in many 1 ) taces really brilliant , restrained but not too cautious , Iriendly but not blind , or rather animated not so much aY friendliness or unfriendliness as by a desire to understand . Lloyd George is not easy to understand . If Mr. Ray/tIond does not fully undertand him , he admits it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final analysis . When we think of Lloyd George we think of fireworks , - 9f chameleons , of will o ' the wisps , of all the world 's worst Or best demagogues , of the six senses of a cat , of a mere-141411y quick response to political temperatures rather than facts , of a wind machine whistling behind a darkened stage . Lloyd George is shrewd but not sagacious , morel- le but soft ; he can usually land on all fours when thrown Out of the window , his one head contains the mind of a whole ' mob : this is about our usual superficial estimate of ' lin . But he ' is vastly more complicated than this , and ' t ) E brief summary will characterize him . For he is many People all at once , and has seemed a different person at tnanY times of his career . If we are to understand him we must examine that career in some detail . This is what Mr , Raymond does , with a keen eye for its essential points . Mr. Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , nnings were poor , but not humble . His family -- -though their chief luxury was " half an egg on Sundays " ? ettioyed a sort of primacy in the Welsh mountain village there his father , William George , a schoolmaster , finally - settled after " an odyssey of disdainful impracticability . " The Georges counted themselves among the poor when titeY thought of the game-keepers and the oppressive squire4rellY around them , but they had " some notion of the 1 , asPect of society from above . " Lloyd George and his rother were the only boys at the village school to wear ' Itlickerbockers . Their uncle , David Lloyd , though a sli ? eroaker , was looked up to as , a local Nonconformist treThet , a figure of some dignity , even saintliness , a " stal7 , - tt and stately soul , " ' stern , bitter , melancholy ; whose ' 110P was the trysting place of all that withstood what Were to him the twin , powers of evil , the Established ' hutch and the Tory Party .

Here per-1 111Pa was the chief source of his early radicalism , but it 1 . as a lively , active radicalism , with no sombre strain in it . linedeleted pro-linedeleted country lad in England to the stage made a country lad is Wales pulpit-struck ' , " for preaching in Wales offered Satisfaction to an " imperious Cymric sense of drama . " butLloyd George , more or less by a chance , sought that atisfaetion in the law instead . Here he " rather special- // But only outwardly . In spite of his nominal subordination as Chancellor of the Exchequer to Asquith 's " genius for abating fervour , " Lloyd George was internally boiling with grandiose schemes . There is not much interest for Americans in the long story of the " People 's Budget " and the veto by the Lords , and we need only stop to remark his peculiar enthusiasm for this measure , now taking the form of Jacobin denunciation of the nobility , now of wildly lyrical visions of the future ; his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on logical to one on emotional grounds . " His one great enemy , " says Mr. Raymond , " was a cool and ' practical examination of his proposals , " which were " not the work of a financier , great or ; small , " but " the product of a considerable poet , working in the expensive medium of politics . " The war caught Lloyd George , as it did so many others , mentally unprepared . The man who had gained a reputation as a pacifist in the Boer War , and who was later in the world war one of those most responsible for pushing it through to victory , was at first on the side of delay , even neutrality . But he " has that type of character which , for good or ill , catches enthusiasm as men catch fevers , " and it was not long before he began to speak of it as an " opportunity " for sacrifice , and to rejoice in " the glow and thrill of a great movement for liberty . " Those words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to a flighty but sound-hearted woman the Great War was to Mr. Lloyd George . It gave him something concrete and despotic to absorb an energy which so far had exceeded both his vision and his judgment . " His instinct was sound : this was his real chance . The war made him great --  " because it gave him much scope for action , and very little occasion for thought . " ? It gave release to the endless supply of faith in himself . And at this time the fact of that faith " was a political factor of the highest importance . " Lloyd George honestly believed that he , and he alone , could save the country . His first steps toward the salvation were as Minister of Munitions . Here his defects were virtues : courage and energy mattered , the cost of their exercise unrestrained by thought did not matter . " What I admire here " ( Mr. Raymond is quoting Dr. Johnson ) " is the total defiance of expense . " But eventually this job settled into a routine which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself with an unemployed surplus of energy . He became restless and unhappy . The War Office seemed for a while a door to something greater . Even in his . pacifist Boer-War days military strategy fascinated him . It fascinated him far more now . He believed the war could be won by operations in the East . But military authorities whom he thought should have obeyed him did not agree . Sir William Robertson baulked him , was preventing him from winning the war . But the premier supported Robertson . Therefore Asquith was the final obstacle . He must go . The story of how he went is one of ugly intrigue that , to speak mildly , does little credit to Lloyd George . He was at last where he wanted to be . It was the power rather than the title that be craved . How wisely he used that power , whether the war was won by his leadership or in spite of it ? Mr. Raymond is sure the former is true ? is still a matter of controversy , though one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a brass band on tired troops . " For this more recent and familiar history we must refer the reader to Mr. Raymond 's clear and full account , stopping only to note how Lloyd George , who began as an " Easterner " and much later talked about the " futility " of " hammering " on the Western front , was in between times an ardent admirer of Nivelle , whose disastrous plans he supported Perhaps because Nivelle seemed to him " that most welcome of all miracles , a scientific soldier without misgivings . " The interesting and complicated story of Lloyd George 's part in the Versailles Treaty is overshadowed by enormous and hideous mistake ? the election of 1918 , which more than any other one fact helped to make the peace s ? bad that the world has since been kept busy devising re , : treats from it . The election cries of " Hang the Kaiser and " Make Germany pay , " while Lloyd George was not directly responsible for them , had his approval at the time . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who would much rather not , " and on this occasion , since what lie really wanted was " a House of Commods reflecting the country 's views on one subject only ? him- self , " he did not trust the people , but loaded in his favor all the dice he could get his hands on . Lloyd George um doubtedly has courage of a kind , but this election seems to have been one of those moments ? they were frequent --  when " he was sufficiently afraid of the people to humor it to its own ultimate disadvantage . " In that disadvantage he has lately acquired a personal share . It is characteristic of him that the peace , which fell cow siderably short of those election promises , he could call " a great Peace , " " a righteous Peace , " and " a Peace chargea with hope , " and that soon after he should be employing all his'ingenuity in deflating it , and in trying to unload from it many of those things other than hope with which it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes and weaknesses , ' Mr. Rar , mond claims for Lloyd George a considerable degree or greatness . That is an arguable question , and it will long continue to be argued . His energy , his zest , his abilitY to throw all of himself into what he was doing , his suprerne - gift for improvisation , his " almost morbid fertility id expedient " helped to win a war which other men of more judgment but less gusto might have lost . These last years show him at his best , even if they were spent repairing his own mistakes . The talents he possesses for repair seem to desert him at the time of creation . Creation requires some foundation of general principle , and a long view of the future . Lloyd George , though one of the best guessers in history , is a short-term guesser . Like an Indian , he can unerringly pick his way mile by mile according to the moss on the trees through political country for which the average English statesman requires a map . Mr. NeYnes , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not granted to other people . But it is hardly a sense of general direc ? tion . And he forgets what ground he has just covered . If " he seldom takes long views of the future , he is ever less incommoded by memories of his past . " No political figure , perhaps , has ever been more light-heartedly inconsistent . He has been both right and wrong on He same subject oftener than almost anyone in history . rie combines a " disarming way of confessing minor litnita ; tions " with the unenviable record of never having au ' mitted himself to be genuinely mistaken . Yet at bottoro , he is " stubbornly consistent . " " He has changed sides and opinions , but he has never changed himself . " We own ? charge him with insincerity : the word or its opposite d ? not apply to him . He believes in himself , he is true to himself , but what he a complicated , divided , iridescent self . " He possesses strangest capacity for dividing his life , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N E W very soul into water-tight compartments . " His mind is a houseful of opposites , a " strange mingling of high impulse with small calculation , " in which are found side by side the faith in money , the disregard for money , the abiding Perception of human reality , the cynical understanding of human weakness ; the sure sense of how to touch the hero in the commonest man , the not less certain divination of the right word to address on occasion to the greatest common meanness of humanity ; the pity for the poor , the distrust of the poor . With all Lloyd George 's sensitiveness to his surrounditts has gone a ruthless independence which has been his chief strength . He is not an Englishman . He has never been enmeshed in that web woven of the past , of friendships , memories , scruples , which binds Englishmen as well , as animates them . His progress , unfettered by any dear background loyalties and allegiances , could be ruthless .

The illus-ttl l'atinns are dim and mediocre ; the explanatory comment wliorse than useless .

Never a great artist , he was , at least , a sin- here and gifted one , and he will be remembered for his enthusiastic fight for realism .

Deficient REPUBLIC IQ I in imagination , he has never achieved a true realism ? the extension of form recessively into three dimensions by means of superimposed planes ? and recognizing his limitations , he has concentrated his efforts on isolated appearances . He is enamored of types ; he has wandered in many lands in search of striking models ; he is absorbed in costumes , smiles and exotic gestures .

As a typical specimen of the routine , perfected method which led to the anarchy of the truly modern artists , we have Childe Hassam , the best-seller of American Impressionism . Conscious that the values Of natural light , when literally reproduced , lose their original life and brilliancy in an envelope of murky pigment , he set out , in the first place , to enliven his canvases by introducing large amounts of complementary tints into the shadows of the colored objects . This was followed by the more advanced step of indicating , not only the shadows , but also the local colors , by facets of pure pigment varying in tint and hue , which , when blended by the eye at a short distance , gave the idea of the vibrant animation of nature itself . Hassam learned the method in France ; it became popular and profitable ; and he has gone on repeating it with amazing productivity ever since .

Impressionism has but little value in black-and-white reproduction ; it is a brilliant colored mask pulled over nature to hide bad drawing , the most ingenious ever invented .

New York : Pitman and Sons . P.M T HIS volume continues the infuriating tradition of English books on economic subjects , being on the whole better written , better informed , more tolerant , more balanced , than American books . Neither the cheerio soap selling economics , nor the Civic Federation hymns of hate ? both of which devastate our presses= -- seem to come out of the tight little island at all . Or if they come , they are not exported . Mr. Bowie is lecturer in economics in the College of Technology , Manchester . He surveys the field of profit-sharing in Great Britain with thoroughness and acumen . When you lay the book down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have learned something . You take a 3x5 card and note thereon , " Profit-sharing , see Bowie*** " ? the three stars meaning that the reference is the best that you have found to date . Profits as the tenderest spot in the current economic struggle are first discussed . Labor 's view of profits is represented by a smashing quotation from the Labour Herald ; the employer 's view by a very fair statement of our old
