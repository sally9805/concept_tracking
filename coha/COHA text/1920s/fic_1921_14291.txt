TIME : The most flourishing period of Solomon 's rule : about 1000 B. C. SCENEThe Throne-Room of Solomon 's royal palace , built in that quarter of Ancient Jerusalem called Millo . The Throne-Room is a vast affair . The walls , from the floor to the ceiling , are covered with cedar wood and adorned with gold fretwork . In the center stands Solomon 's world-celebrated throne , of massive ivory , overlaid with gold . It is elevated on a platform , and a bronze lion stands on each side of it . An ascent of six steps leads up to it , and on each side of each step stands a bronze lion . They face toward the front , twelve in all , symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel over which Solomon holds sway . In the back , at the center , is an open balcony , giving on a garden of trees beneath . The tops of the trees come up to the edge of the balcony . Enter Abishag . She is a young and slender , brown-bodied girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a skirt to the knees . Her legs and arms are bare . She has an agile girlish beauty that belongs to open fields and free hilltops . Stepping slowly and carefully about , she follows the contour of the room , with outspread palms against the walls , like one seeking escape . Her anklets and armlets make a tinkling sound . Coming on the balcony , in the back , she looks out , as if about to leap into the near tops of the trees . But , in all her movements , she has been stealthily followed , by the Chief Eunuch , Shamgazar , who now , coming close to her , clutches her by the right arm and slowly swings her back to the center of the room . Abishag is brought to a kneeling position : she pulls away from Shamgazar . SHAMGAZAR Amend thy folly , girl ! There is no maidenFrom the Euphrates to the river NileBut sorrows for the lack of what is thine , Yearns all her girlhood for the thing thou hast  --  The love of Solomon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sought it not ! Let him have many maidens , yea , as manyAs almond blossoms putting forth in Spring , So that he come not nigh me with his arms , Nor touch me with the lips of his desire ! SHAMGAZAR ( impressively ) Abishag , he is ruler of the world ! ABISHAG Good  --  so he be not ruler of my heart ! ( She turns and looks out into garden . ) SHAMGAZAR Ten thousand bearded men guard Solomon ; About his palace wait ten thousand menWith shield and sword . Then , who can bring thee help ? Be wise ; accept the great king 's love . ( Dropping down disconsolately , Abishag seats herself on the first step of the throne . A pause . Then , the words inaudible , a song is heard without . ) ABISHAG I amAbiathar 's , and his alone , Shamgazar ! ( Softer . ) That song  --  how could I hear it and say else ? SHAMGAZAR ' T is Solomon 's song of one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sang among the hills , Tending our sheep . SHAMGAZAR The world is singing itFrom Tyre to Elath . ABISHAG &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' T was our one hearts ' songAt even , when the sheep were folded safe . SHAMGAZAR Put by all dreams of shepherds and green hills . A thousand towns and cities walled with stoneHave sent the whitest of their maidens hither , And from the flower of these hast thou been chosen , The one bud to break into bloom for him . But wherefore trouble I my heart with thee ? Thou art a maiden , and thou dost but fearWhat thou hast never known . ( Clapping his hands . ) Come hither , Milcah ! ( Enter Milcah , who is to be handmaid to Abishag . Milcah is tall . She is paler than Abishag , with the pallor that comes from living an indoor life , in the palace . She is dressed elaborately after the Egyptian fashion , the style having been set by the Egyptian Princess , daughter of King Psusennes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great house , for her own private use , after her marriage to him. ) p. 5 SHAMGAZAR ( to Milcah ) Attend the Queen ! ( Shamgazar goes out . ) MILCAH ( rushing up to Abishag and embracing her ) Abishag ! Thou ! ABISHAG ( returning the embrace ) As my soul liveth , Milcah of the Plains ! What dost thou here ? MILCAH I am handmaid to the King. ( Lower . ) And hast thou thanked Jehovah yet ? ABISHAG I pray , With every thought , for my deliverance . MILCAH ( astonished ) For the deliverance ! Art thou not glad ? ABISHAG ( dumfounded ) Glad , Milcah ? MILCAH ( reprovingly ) Yea , that thou art chosen queenTo sit by Solomon on a throne of gold ! Why , I , who was his but a day , rejoice ! ABISHAG ( smiling confidently ) Didst know Abiathar ? MILCAH ( surprised ) That tall , ill-favored shepherd lad ? p. 6 ABISHAG ( severely ) The same  --  but comely as the tents of Kedar MILCAH Thou lovedst him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have none other . MILCAH ( looking about her , with a frightened air ) If thou wouldst liveThen hold thy peace , lest thou be overheard . ABISHAG Nay , I 'll speak out , ev'n if my words bring death . MILCAH Doubt not but thou shalt die , thwarting the King.But be to him the thing that he desiresAnd he will make thy pathways delicateAnd all thy goings-out and comings-inAs soft as wool. Music will wait upon theeOf divers instruments , and all the worldWill bow before thee Tyre will bring thee purple ; All Egypt will be raiment unto thee ; Ivory and apes and gold will come by ships , Crowding the sea with white like cloud on cloud , While peacocks draw their fans down jacinth courtsAnd make a sound like wind among blown leaves . ABISHAG ( vehemently angry ) Milcah , thou speakest with an harlot 's tongue.Go from me ; I command thee , being Queen . ( Milcah goes out . Solomon 's Song again comes from the garden under the balcony . But now a man 's voice sings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; I bent in worship to its light  --  Then star on star , and star on star &nbsp; &nbsp; Drew here and there my sight ; The moon rose  --  to the moon I bowed ; &nbsp; &nbsp; In its great light the stars were gone  --  The moon , that , graying to a ghost , &nbsp; &nbsp; Went out before the sun . Women are many , thou , but one  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; The lights of heaven are but three , The stars , the moon , and then  --  the sun ! &nbsp; &nbsp; O Love , make day for me ! ( The singing ceases. ) p. 7 ABISHAG ( recognizing Abiathar 's voice , and leaning over ) Abiathar ! ABIATHAR ( faintly , from below ) Abishag ! ( Abiathar is seen climbing in the very top of a tree near the edge of the veranda . Abishag reaches out her hand and helps him in . Abiathar holds her at arm 's length , fondly gazing at her . Then they embrace . ) ABISHAG &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How camest thouThrough all those eyes and spears that hedge with deathThe gates and gardens of King Solomon ? ABIATHAR ( laughing boldly ) Simple the deed was as the words that tell:When the bright moon swam forth , I hid , and whenIt hid , I ran , and slid from tree to tree , From shade to shadow , climbing guarded walls , Unseen , until , by chance , I heard your voice  --  And then I sang ! ABISHAG &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' T is strange that thou aloneCouldst do so great a deed. And didst thou fear not , Singing ? p. 8 ABIATHAR ( quickly ) There is no hope for us but death ! ABISHAG The prophets say that God is merciful . ABIATHAR The king , I think , is not . ABISHAG He has concubines , And seven hundred wives . ABIATHAR &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most  --  till others come . ( ' Trumpets without ; cries of " The King , " " King Solomon . " ) ABIATHAR ( showing dagger ) Now death must takeAnother , beside us ! ABISHAG Thou slay the King ! ABIATHAR Aye , even Solomon , that mighty king . And wherefore not ? What pity hath he for thee , Or me , thy lover ? HERALD ( approaching from without ) Make way for Solomon ! ABISHAG ( hurriedly ) Convey thee hence behind yon throne and hide thee ; Then , after I have sought the uttermost  --  p. 9 ABIATHAR ( embracing her )  --  The dagger ! ( Going . ) I will slay him with one thrust ! HERALD ( entering , crosses stage in stately and pompous fashion , as he chants : ) Make way for Solomon , that mighty king ! Wiser than Ethan , the famed Ezrahite , Than Heman , Chalcol , and the sons of Mahol , Is Solomon , the Chosen of the Lord . Hath he not made of songs a thousand and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Abishag seats herself on lower step to throne and waits . Herald chants as he disappears : ) Make way for Solomon ! Make way for Solomon ! ( Trumpets are heard again . A momentary silence . Solomon appears . He is a tall , rather stout man . He wears a turban , starry with jewels . It is green . He has flashing black eyes and a black beard . When he smiles his teeth flash white . He walks as if with a sense of his own greatness and magnificence , with his arms folded . Yet his smile shows that , in spite of his unlimited power , he is , when he wills , whimsically human . ) SOLOMON ( standing over Abishag , and looking down at her ) Abishag , lovest thou me ? p. 10 ABISHAG ( looking up ) I love thee not , nor will I bide thy wish . SOLOMON Others have vowed the same , nor kept that vow . ABISHAG ( with slow determination ) I have not vowed . I have no need of vowsTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascends throne and sits down on it , resting his chin on his hand . From this position he studies Abishag , who remains seated on the lower step of the ascent . ) SOLOMON Thou hastAnother lover ? ABISHAG Nay , I know but one . SOLOMON ( leaning down , seriously ) One more , Abishag , than I 've ever known ! ABISHAG ( looking up into his face with sudden vivacity . She is curious and would hear further ) Nay , but the great King points a jest at me ? SOLOMON Would it were so . Yet could I somewhere findThat love 's perfection I have ever sought , And never won , my seven hundred wives Would I return to their far tribes again , On seven hundred camels , royally . ( Softly . ) Abishag , hast thou ever heard my song , " O Love , Make Day For Me ? " p. 11 ABISHAG All but the deaf have heard it , mighty king ' SOLOMON ( sadly dreaming ) Yea , lovers sing it underneath the moon , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening air all hushed and still ; It is the world 's one word of happy love , The love which , hapless , I have never known . ( Sighing . ) A dream I shaped from a far dream 's desire ! ABISHAG ( searching his thought ) But thou hast gold from Ophir , and the wealthOf twenty kingdoms ready at thy wish ! SOLOMON But who has bought love since the world began ? ABISHAG Yet , after God , thou hast the highest place . SOLOMON So ' t is the power I wear , not I , is loved . ABISHAG God gave thee wisdom passing all the world . SOLOMON Women love neither Wisdom nor the Wise . ABISHAG ( with wonder and incredulity ) Thou never hast been loved ? SOLOMON By those I loved not , The which is worse than hate . p. 12 ABISHAG ( with swift firmness ) Thou hast said my thought . SOLOMON ( rising and coming down to her ) Handmaid , I will not reason with thee longer . ( She rises , facing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift , And as a gift I 'll use thee . If thou yield notThou shalt be made a handmaid to my handmaids.Yielding , thou shalt possess an equal throne . And I have gold from Ophir and the wealth  --  ABISHAG ( laughing ) Nay , who hath bought love since the world began ? SOLOMON Yet , after God , mine is the highest place . ABISHAG Then would I love thy power and place , not thee . SOLOMON God gave me wisdom passing all mankind . ABISHAG Women love neither Wisdom nor the Wise . SOLOMON Thou mockest me ? ABISHAG Thy wisdom I repeat ! SOLOMON ( entranced and flattered ) Brown-bodied little woman from the hills , Is there no way by which to win thy love ? p. 13 ABISHAG None but to be indeed the man I love . SOLOMON What man is he ? ABISHAG A shepherd of my tribe . I 'll tell of him no further lest thou sendThose who will come with swords and seek him out . SOLOMON ( scornfully ) And make a slave my rival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou art wise , great king , in all but love . SOLOMON What man knew woman since recorded time ? ABISHAG But thou , the wisest  --  SOLOMON &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay , I know them lessThan my least slave , for , seven hundred times , I have shown lack of wisdom , marrying . ABISHAG And still thou seekest love in me , great king ? SOLOMON ( earnestly ) For thou ' rt the only woman I have loved . ABISHAG A lie repeated seven hundred times . p. 14 SOLOMON Nay , for nowIt springs , a living glory , born of truth:Not words lip-said , but brought deep from the heartAs divers fetch up pearls from dangered seas . ( A pause . ) Yea , and if thou wilt not come unto meThen I shall find ways out to bend thy will . Even now , even now thou livest at my word . Put by all thoughts of shepherds and green hills . A thousand towns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hither , And from the flower of these hast thou been chosen , The one bud to break into bloom for me . ABISHAG I am Abiathar 's , and his alone I will speak out , ev'n if my words bring death . SOLOMON ( angrily ) Doubt not but thou shalt die , denying me : ( Persuasively . ) But be to me the thing that I desire , And I will make thy pathways delicate , And all thy goings-out and comings-inAs soft as wool. Music shall wait on theeOf divers instruments , and all the worldWill bow before thee Tyre will bring thee purple ; All Egypt will be raiment unto thee ; Ivory and apes and gold will come by shipsCrowding the sea with white like cloud on cloud . ( Abiathar now suddenly and silently steps from behind throne . Thrice he lifts dagger to stab the King , and each time lowers it . As he is lowering it the third time , Solomon turns , with slow imperial dignity , and laughs in his face. ) p. 15 SOLOMON Abiathar , thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is a toy Too perilous for youth to play with so . Here ! Give it me ! ( He reaches for it . Abiathar draws back . ) What , child , thou thinkest to slay Solomon ? ABIATHAR Aye , to slay Solomon , who steals my love . SOLOMON Thy love  --  ? And darest thou rival Israel 's king ? ABIATHAR We have gone hand in hand since childhood , sire . SOLOMON ( admiringly ) Thou art a bold youth . ABIATHAR Love hath made me so . SOLOMON So thou wouldst slay me ? But what held thy hand ? Thrice thou assayedst . ABIATHAR Thou art God 's Anointed. ( Kneeling . ) So to the merciful be merciful . If not  --  even yet  --  SOLOMON And thinkest thou , bold young man , That I was not aware ? Rash boy , I knewThe moment that thou wentest from thy tent , Thy solitary tent among the hills , Where thou didst guard thy flocks nigh Daberath , On Tabor 's morning heights how thou didst trackThe caravan which brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My secret watchers held thee in their eyeAt Bethel , Beroth , and Gibeon . And when thou didst assay the guarded walls'Twas at my laughing wish the Watch withdrew Yea , in the light of intermittent moons , And from the sinking of the day till dawn , And through each golden passage of the sun , Eyes watched thy goings-out and comings-in  --  And , but I had reserved thee for my sport , Thou hadst gone down to the forgotten DarkTen dawns ago . p. 16 ABIATHAR ( firmly ) Do with me as thou wilt . ( Kneeling , he offers up his dagger to King . ) ABISHAG ( also kneeling ) And do with me as thou wilt do with him . SOLOMON ( triumphantly ) Behold the wisdom of the King 's device ! ( He waves his hand . The wall to the right slowly opens , and five bearded and armed men are seen . Another wave of the hand , and the wall closes again . ) Thou art taken fast like any silly birdThat drops upon a twig and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneel , unspeaking . ) Lovest thou not life , that thou dost rush on death ? Bethink thee , thou art young , Abiathar ! ABIATHAR Without love life is naught. It was thy song  --  ( Choking . ) ( Solomon 's face grows alit with sudden interest . He leans forward . ) Thy song  --  that taught me so ! SOLOMON ( pleased ) How , boy ? My song ? ABIATHAR Thy song that oft I sang on silver evesAnd in the soft , rose-dappled dawns . p. 17 ABISHAG ( taking up ) Thy songThat thou didst make , of One and Perfect Love ( In a soft , sweet voice . ) How oft we sang that song among the hillsTending our sheep . ( Solomon 's face is bright with childlike pleasure . ) It was our hearts ' one songAt even , when the sheep were folded safeAnd the long shadows marched down from the hills . SOLOMON ( smiling imperially ) And so he won thee with ( fondly ) those words of mine ? ABISHAG ( joyfully ) ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , so is itWith all of Israel ! SOLOMON ( learning forward eagerly ) " With all of Israel ! " What meanest thou ? ABIATHAR ( confidently answering for Abishag ) Under the spell and music of thy song , The world has turned to walking two by twoIn perfect love , in simple happiness . SOLOMON ( half musing ) That happiness which never will be mine , That love , which , hapless , I shall never know  --  Ah , Dream I shaped from a far dream 's desire ! p. 18 ABISHAG ( with a woman 's quickness , pressing the perceived advantage ) Thou hast taught all the world this strange , new thing  --  That faithful love holds only room for two , That every man , each woman , must create , Anew , the garden of God 's paradiseBy walking hand in hand , like Adam and Eve , Before mankind became a multitude . SOLOMON ( full of ecstasy at his fame ) Abishag and Abiathar , arise ! ( They stand before him . ) There 's something makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but ye may goBack to your hills ! ( They fall at his feet . ) Aye , ye may go  --  ( Sadly ; half to self . ) ' T is I that am the one caught in a net . Nay , what am I , before this youth and love ? My only empire is an empty heart , My lifted sceptre , but a gilded boast ; The glory that I have possesses me ; I am weighed down with splendor to my death , Am sickened by the wasting of desire For what my wisdom , seeking , can not find  --  And all is vanity of vanities ! ( A pause then , with a proud , ringing voice. )
