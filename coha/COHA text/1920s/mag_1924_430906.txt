THERE is a favorite story about the young Alexander Graham Bell . Just 50 years ago , Bell 's first crude baby telephone had been placed on exhibition in an out-of-the-way corner of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia , while its struggling young creator remained in Boston , " broke . " Every penny had gone into his invention , and he felt he could not afford to make the trip to the exposition . But Bell had fallen deeply in love with a little deaf girl , Mabel Hubbard . She w a s making the trip to the exposition and the young inventor went to the railway station in Boston to say good-bye to her . There she learned for the first time that he was not to go ; was not to see the product of his labor gain a place in the halls of fame . She coaxed him to go . He remained firm . She pleaded , to no avail . At last , just as the train was pulling from the station , Bell saw the girl in tears ! Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do . He dashed madly after the train , and leaped aboard ? without baggage or ticket . And so he went to the Centennial , and there , by the merest thread of a chance , he got his opportunity to give to the world what is perhaps the most tremendously useful of all today 's marvelous agencies of civilization . One reason why this little story is repeated here is this : The other day I mentioned it to an old employee of Doctor Bell . And he told me the story could n't be true , could n't have happened . For my part , I 'm just as well satisfied , and the story of the impetuous lover is just as real as it ever was . For all the rest of the wonderful things this inventor ( lid could n't have been true , either . The most learned scientists and experimenters of the day said so . THE telephone , they asserted never could happen . Make wire talk ? Absurd ! A hole through the center of the wire , perhaps . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? we have the telephone today . Even now , as you put a funny looking black thing to your ear and hear the voice of a friend from hundreds or thousands of miles away , it seems scarcely possible that it can be true . And yet it is . Or , as majestic organ notes come floating out into your room from the radio loudspeaker ? music brought across a continent through 3000 miles of inarticulate nothingness ? you feel that it really ca n't happen . And yet , marvelously , as we all know , it does ! That these things are so ? that we can talk by wire and talk by wireless , and can be heard as clearly as if we were talking to some one in the . same room ? is due solely to the fact that a tall , pale-faced professor in his twenties , whose profession was to teach deaf mutes how to speak , did n't know it was impossible to transmit to a distance the sound of human voices by electricity and refused to believe it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him a dreamer , he went to work all the harder , in blissful disregard of their reasons why " it could n't be done . " " If I can make a deaf mute talk , I can make iron talk , " he once said to his patron , Gardiner G. Hubbard . Hubbard laughed at him . " You 're talking nonsense , " he said . But Bell stuck to his vision . And with the fine courage and tremendous enthusiasm of youth , he made his dream , and more , come true . Fate , too , which somehow appears ever to watch over the discou. - aging struggles of young inventors , took a hand . Thus , ' if Bell had not been a voice teacher , and if he had not met and fallen in love with a deaf girl , the secret of the telephone might yet remain to be discovered . For , as you will see presently , it was only through his thorough knowledge of the mechanics of sound and the mysteries of speech and hearing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " talking telegraph " when it came to him in a revealing flash . Again , if a young mechanic who was aiding him in his experiments had not turned down a certain screw too tightly , that first voice never could have been heard . And , finally , if Bell had n't caught that train for Philadelphia , and if a certain Emperor of Brazil , Dom Pedro byname , had not happened along at the Centennial Exposition at the most opportune moment , the embryo telephone might today be resting in some museum as a useless and curious scientific toy . Such a fate is not at all hard to imagine . THE Sesqui-Centennial Exposition that is scheduled to open in Philadelphia in June , commemorating the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the American republic , will commemorate also the dramatic scene that took place in that other exposition 50 years ago , when Bell 's  | telephone was brought to the attention of the scientific world as something workable . It was a hot Sunday in June . For six weeks the models of Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a little table shoved in a corner between a wall and a stairway . But on this day the exposition judgeshad promised to spend a few moments , during their tour of inspection , examining the odd creations . THE young professor stood by his little table waiting , nervous and a little discouraged , perhaps , as hour after hour of the hot afternoon went by without a sign of the judges . When a came , the day was spent . They and hungry and uninterested . judges picked up the teleph ceiver , glanced at it , and placed again on the table . Another derisive remark , and the rest 1 Bell 's heart sank . But just then there happened an amazing thing . Into the room walked Dom Pedro , the Emperor , followed by his retinue . With arms outstretched he strode straight to the young inventor . " Professor Bell , " he exclaimed , " I am delighted to see you ! " If the judges were surprised , Bell was dumbfounded . He had forgotten that Don Pedro ante had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emperor had been interested in establishing a similar school in Brazil . Of a sudden the judges became all attention as Dom Pedro placed the receiver to his ear . Bell , who had strung a wire across the room for demonstration purposes , stepped to the far end and spoke into the transmitter . As he did so , Dom Pedro jerked his head away from the receiver , threw up his hands in utter amazement , and cried : " My God , it talks ! " IT CERTAINLY did . Every one of the judges wanted to try it . What a moment before had been ridiculed as a " plaything " instantly became " the most marvelous discovery in electrical science . " That dramatic moment marked the beginning of the telephone 's growth , a growth so tremendous that today , half a century later , more than 16,000,000 telephones are serving the people of the United States alone , and telephone service has become one of the most commonplace necessities of our every-day business and social life . Luck , you may say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the kind of luck that , by some strange quirk of creation , comes unexpectedly to reward the man of vision who clings desperately to an elusive idea and spends days and nights of heartbreaking labor overcoming failures and carrying his idea to fulfillment . Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Bell 's invention was the fact that he was not an electrician . His knowledge of electricity was exceedingly limited . On the other hand , he was a specialist in vocal physiology , as his father and grandfather had been before him ; a student of voice , of tone , pitch , and modulation . To him the sound box of the voice and vibrating diaphragm of the ear suggested untold possibilities for creating a mechanical sound box and a mechanical diaphragm that might transmit the vibrations of sound , with all its intricate variations , through the medium of electricity . " If I could make a current of electricity vary in intensity precisely as the air varies in density during the production of a sound , " he confided to Thomas A. Watson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his historic preliminary experiments , " I should be able to transmit speech telegraphically . " And so he sought to apply his knowledge of sound to the mysteries of electricity through tireless plodding experiment . In this , strange to say , his first important asset was his very ignorance of electrical science . " HAD I known more about electricity and less about sound , " he once said , " 1 never should have invented the telephone . " The explanation was this : Electrical experts of the day , to whom the telegraph and the Atlantic cable were the crowning achievements , already were bound by rules and formulas . They had set certain limitations on electricity and what it could do . They knew , or thought they knew , for example , that transmis sion was impossible except by intermittent current ; that is , by making , and breaking an electrical circuit as in the telegraph . But to young Bell , in his ignorance and enthusiasm , nothing was impossible . If his imagination- told him it would be a wonderful thing if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ance with variations of sound , why then it might be done regardless of any rules ; and it was worth trying . A second asset was Bell 's inherited passion for invention . As a boy he had built an artificial skull of rubber which , when filled with air from a hand bellows , would produce a sound startlingly similar to the human voice . He also had devised a toy dog that would bark . When at the age of 24 he was called to Boston to teach a school of deaf mutes , and later when he became a professor of elocution in Boston ' University , his en thusiasm for inyention persisted . THE cellar in the home of one of his deaf pupils became his laboratory and workshop , and there in a litter of wires , tuning forks , and magnets he spent every spare hour . One of the first products of his experiments was a machine for making visible records of sound vibrations , with which he hoped to aid the deaf to speak . Once , when he mentioned his experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Bell , why do n't you use a real human ear ? " The surgeon supplied the ear , and Bell proceeded to rig up a contrivance by which , when he spoke or sang into the ear , a straw attached to the eardrum would make a visible record of the vibrations on a moving piece of smoked glass . In his study of the ear , Bell was amazed at the efficiency ) ; N Ali which the delicate eardrum could transmit vibrations through heavy bones . " If this thin little disk can set up vibrations in bones , " he asked himself , " why ca n't a metal disk set up vibrations in a metal wire ? " Out of this query grew the conception of telephone diaphragms connected by an electric wire . Another product of Bell 's cellar laboratory was an instrument that he called  | a " harmonic telegraph " and with which , by making use of sympathetic vibration , he hoped to achieve multiple telegraphy ; that is , to send half a dozen or so Morse messages over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for this that he enlisted the aid of Watson , the young mechanic , and moved his workshop to a garret above an electrical supply shop where Watson worked . FOR months that extended into years the two young men struggled with the harmonic telegraph , but never were they quite able to make it behave . Yet it was through their dogged persistence in the face of repeated failure that the whole secret of the telephone suddenly came out of hiding and revealed itself to Bell in one dramatic instant . Briefly , the transmitter and receiver of the harmonic telegraph each consisted of a flat piece of steel clock spring attached to an electromagnet in such a way that when the current was on , it would vibrate with a sort of whine at a certain pitch . In addition , make-and-break points were provided to break up the whine into the dots and dashes of Morse messages . The idea was to use several pairs of these instruments on a single line , each pair tuned to vibrate sympathetically without interfering with any of the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to send any number of messages simultaneously . The only trouble was that the messages persisted in getting mixed up because of inaccuracies in tuning . In the experiments Watson would handle the transmitting end , while Bell , in another room , would do the tuning . One sweltering afternoon in June , 1875 , the two were hard at work in the hot garret , busy at the endless job of testing . Everything seemed to be discouragingly out of harmony . Watson was making the transmitters whine while Bell was retuning the receiver springs one by one . All at once one of the transmitters stopped vibrating . Watson plucked it with his finger to start it again . It would n't start , he kept on plucking . SUDDENLY there came a shout from Bell and he rushed in excitedly from the next room . " What did you do then ? " he cried . " Do n't change anything ! Let me see ! " Together they examined the instrument . They found that the adjusting screw had been set so tightly that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so , when Watson had plucked the spring , the circuit remained unbroken . At the same time the vibration of the magnetized strip of steel over the pole of its magnet had brought to fulfillment the great dream of Bell . It had generated " a current of electricity varying in intensity precisely as the air varies in density during the production of a sound . " That current had passed through the wire to the next room , and there the receiver had caught and transformed it back into a  | faint echo of the sound of the vibrating spring . Bell 's marvelously trained ear had caught that echo and had recognized its significance . That was the birth of the telephone . It was the kind of revelation that would have passed by any other man than Bell unnoticed . But he , trained and schooled in the intricacies of sound , recognized instantly that if the complex vibrations of one sound could be transmitted , speech could be transmitted likewise . THAT night the first model of a speaking telephone was built by Watson at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day , though it made strange noises , it would n't speak a word ! There followed more days and nights of experiments , and it was not until nine months later ? on March 10 , 1876 ? that the telephone spoke its first complete sentence . What it said was this : " Mr. Watson , please come here , I want you . " And Watson , down in the basement , ran up three flights of stairs three steps at a time to get there . " I can hear you ! " he yelled . " I can hear the words ! "  |
