ONE morning some twenty years ago a crowd was gathered around a shoe-store window on Summer Street , Boston , watching a man at work . Other pedestrians , seeing the group , stopped and edged their way toward the window until they , too , could see the man behind the plate glass . Inside the window was a buzz saw driven by an electric motor , and with this buzz saw the man was sawing up shoes . Z-i-n-g ! would go the saw , and then the man would hold up for the crowd 's inspection the two halves of a brand-new shoe of the make sold in the store . Z-i-n-g ! And the crowd would be shown the two halves of some other maker 's shoe , so that it could see the difference of the material which went into the soles and heels of the two shoes . Hour after hour the man sawed shoes ? new shoes , half-worn shoes , dilapidated old shoes . The window was heaped with shoes , sawed and unsawed . People stopped to look and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripping their own shoes to pieces and showing them in comparison with shoes of competitors . " This company 's shoes must be made of good materials or they would n't dare do that , " was the first thought . " They are ? I can see that they are , " was the second . And this was followed in so many cases by a third , " I must buy a pair , " that inside of a few months men were sawing up shoes in the windows of this company 's stores all over the country . For weeks these window demonstrations continued . So great were the crowds they attracted that in some cities the police had to request the man in the window to stop sawing at intervals in order to relieve the sidewalk congestion . The man who developed that simple idea of sawing up shoes to show people how well they were made exercised shrewd imagination about people and their buying processes . He knew that in selling shoes he faced the same fundamental selling resistance which confronts a hunter , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the eye may be sold by the outward appearance , but the intellect demands to know what is underneath or inside . The huxter tips the basket of strawberries into his hand to show the buyer the berries on the bottom of the basket , or he plugs the watermelon to show that it is sound and ripe inside ; the shoe man sawed his shoes apart from toe to heel for the same purpose . The demonstration sold shoes so successfully that it is credited with being one of the largest single factors in winning a national reputation for this make of shoe . Probably no subject in the world has more fascination for the keen-minded business man than the study of how people are influenced to exchange their money for the commodities of life ? why they will spend willingly for one class of commodities and grudgingly for another ; why they will buy this and will not buy that ; how they may be led into new buying channels ; and what methods are most effective in stimulating the buying impulse . Buying is a mental function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of imagination applied or supplied from without ? applied to the buyer 's mind in such a way as to take advantage of his mental ductility , or to the product in such a way as to cause it to react favorably on his mind ; or supplied to his mind so that he sees the product in a new light and as something he desires . The man who first conceived the idea of putting trays of penny candies , wrapped individually in waxed paper , right above or beside the piles of newspapers on the Subway and Elevated news stands was applying his imagination to people . Ile believed that by tempting people by one-cent units he could induce them to spend the change they had left after buying their newspapers . To find how right he was in his imagination about people one has but to stand for half an hour beside one of these news stands and count the number of persons who lay down a nickel and pick up a newspaper and two or three of the penny candies . The unit of sale is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; the sale is coupled with the almost automatic purchasing of the evening newspaper ; the result is the development in time of what amounts almost to subconscious buying . The sale falls within that class of transactions which are made frequently without the aid of conscious decision , such as the buying of the newspaper itself , the paying of one 's ear fare , the signing of a club luncheon slip . Fortunate indeed is the man who can enlist the subconscious minds of his customers in his sales transactions with them ! The two North Dakota men who took the " middlings , " " shorts , " and " bran " of wheat , mixed them , bleached them white , and put up the resulting cereal in packages as a breakfast food , applied imagination to a product . These grades of wheat have always presented a difficult selling problem to millers ; they have generally been sold in bulk at a low price for stock feed . But put up in a form that pleases the eye , and marketed under a name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despised , though none the less delectable and nutritious , grades of wheat has been sold at a good price and profit for consumption at American breakfast tables . The seedsman who devotes a page in his catalogue to collections of seed packets suitable for various complete gardens ? a city garden , a country garden , a suburban garden , an old-fashioned flower garden ? is supplying imagination to people who need to know what , they shall plant in their gardens . Undoubtedly he sells several more packets of seeds to most of the customers ordering these garden collections than he would do if these customers made up their own combinations . The principle involved is the same as that behind the marketing of such units as sets of books , chests of silver , and week-end candy packages . Its success is based on the proneness of people 's minds to accept suggested assortment units of merchandise rather than to use their own imaginative function . These are homely examples , but they serve to illustrate the difference between imagination applied to a product , and imagination supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse behind the scenes of the human mind when going through the process of buying . It is when we enter the field of imagination applied to people that we find some of the most interesting stories of marketing successes . Several years ago a man by the name of Tilyou came into sudden fame by applying his imagination to the problem of marketing amusement . It had always been assumed that when people paid money for amusement they expected to be amused , and amusement enterprises of the Coney Island type , with their merry-go-rounds and roller coasters and shoot-the-chutes , were operated chiefly upon that principle . Then came Tilyou with imagination about people , and he built an amusement enterprise based on the idea that people would just as gladly pay their money to be permitted to amuse themselves . When he opened Steeplechase Park at Coney Island people swarmed there to slide down polished inclines and roll around on revolving tables and walk across agitated floors , shrieking with laughter as they worked at amusing themselves . To-day nearly every large amusement park of the Coney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the greatest hilarity is usually found in them , for they foster that absolute abandon which is the real essence of amusement . Amusement is such an elemental problem that it is a great wonder so many years passed by before a man appeared with the imagination which carried him back to the elemental period ? childhood ? for the secret of play , and then was able to apply that secret to the amusement of grown-ups . We all know that the average child can derive more real pleasure from a sloping cellar door or a broken egg-beater or a stick and a string and a puddle of water ? things he or she can play on , with , or in ? than from the most elaborate form of planned juvenile entertainment , though it involve the costliest paraphernalia . Yet the world waited long for the discovery that under our adult crust of convention we are all children and that we will play hilariously as such if we can but be induced to laugh ourselves out of our self-consciousness ? a process which is now one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of the use of imagination in connection with marketing amusement is the midnight show . A certain New York theatrical producer bethought himself that there were many persons who , having started out to " make an evening of it , " were not ready to go to their homes or hotels at 11.30 P.M. They were still in the market for amusement . For years he had marketed music and dancing and costumes ( or the lack of them ) at 8.15 ' P.M. Now his imagination about people suggested that he market the same commodities , but at a new hour ? midnight . This he did quite successfully until prohibition , putting too much of a strain on the sober imaginations of his patrons , made the entertainment unprofitable . Venturing into the field of national psychology , we find that it was an Englishman 's imagination about the English people that saved a certain American food-product manufacturer from possible failure in the English market . The American manufacturer 's selling campaign in the British Isles was falling far short of the success he had anticipated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light of his phenomenal success in America . He was baffled . At a banquet in London he happened to be seated next to a young Englishman who had imagination about the English people . During the course of the dinner the two men fell to discussing the selling campaign for this food product . The American confided his fear that his product was not going to be accepted by the English public as he had hoped it would be , and he admitted that he was at a loss to understand the reason . The young Englishman explained to him that he believed the problem to be a very simple one ? one of psychology rather than product . " You are trying to market your product as a health food , " he said . " If there is one thing more than another to which an Englishman objects , it is to be thought in poor health . He may have one foot in the grave , but he wants people to think of him as ' topping . ' Then , smiling , he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product to the English people as something good to eat ? " The result of that conversation was that the American food-product manufacturer engaged his young table companion as the English sales and advertising manager , to win the English market for his product . In a short time the trick was turned . The product which had not interested the English people as a health food they took to quickly as " something good to eat " ; and a large business was developed in the English market as the result of this young man 's imagination about his fellow Englishmen . This experience in racial psychology illustrates convincingly the importance of accurate imagination concerning the people of any new country in which a product is to be introduced . The selling of bread is probably one of the oldest marketing problems in the world , which makes it seem all the more remarkable that extended chains of a new type of bakery store are just now rapidly spreading over America . For many , many years the working part of a bakery was regarded as a " No admittance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floury precinct where no one could possibly see the bakers at work . Then came a man with imagination about people and turned the bakery inside out . He thought people would like to see their bread baked and to know that it was fresh and clean , and so he put the ovens and the bakers in the front window ! Then he went farther ; and I am told that it was not until he took this last step that he was completely successful ? he cut holes in the fronts of his open-face bakeries and set in blowers to blow the smell of the fresh-baked bread out to the sidewalk to lure people in to buy . This man merely applied to bread the same selling psychology that has been the success of the delicatessen , the cafeteria , the glass-walled pop-corn machine , the " hot-dog " man , and the modern bakery-restaurant with its windows full of high-art pastry . He recognized the important fact that food is sold to the masses through their eyes and their noses ; and with keen marketing imagination he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staple of life . In the year 1910 a bank accountant in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , applied his imagination about people to the problem of marketing the services of savings banks . He conceived the idea of inducing school children to save a cent a week on the cumulative plan and , at the end of a certain period , he returned their ? savings to them in the form of a cheek . A fellow accountant , perceiving that the plan seemed to appeal to young people , in turn applied his imagination to adapting it to adults . It is a fact generally recognized in savings-bank circles that it is difficult to get people to save money unless they are supplied with a definite incentive for saving and a definite time is set when their saving stint shall be completed . This the second accountant did by applying the weekly saving plan to the universal need of money for buying Christmas gifts . Christmas presented a definite time , and a Christmas fund pre- , sented a definite incentive for saving . The plan he finally developed was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each week during the year until two weeks before Christmas , when a check for the entire amount with interest would be returned to each depositor . He called this new saving system the Christmas Club . Within ten years three thousand banks in the United States were conducting these Christmas Clubs , with a total membership of more than three million depositors , and the enormous sum of one hundred and ten million dollars on deposit . The success of this plan represents more than the success of an ingenious scheme . It is true that the mechanics of the plan do appeal to American people ; their minds seem to like to play up and down the scale of increasing Weekly payments , just as children like to climb up and down ladders . But the roots of the plan 's success undoubtedly go deeper into human nature ; they feed on pride , the motive that drives people into " keeping up " with their neighbors and friends in their Christmas expenditures . Furthermore , the incorporation of the word " club " lit the name undoubtedly i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A willingness to follow a crowd in almost any direction is one of the character 's ' ties of human nature . To have called the scheme the Christmas saving " plan " would have made it an individual affair lacking in popular appeal : but by using the term " club , " the founder made use of that impression of crowd motion without which no scheme of this kind could hope to enjoy the fullest success . Thus imagination , applied with a proper appreciation of the psychology of saving , developed millions of dollars of new business for the savings banks of America . Another instance of imagination applied to the Christmas-giving problem is the merchandise certificate now used by so many men 's furnishing stores . Probably the man whose imagination first told him that a gift certificate would appeal to people on account of their lack of imagination regarding what to give or Christmas and their laziness about Mopping , had no idea it would develop /s it has done . Even to-day few persons realize to what an extent these certifi-.ates - in - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over a lousand dollars to a single customer are lot uncommon in some of the larger city stores , and they sometimes run up into 3ve figures . Probably the record sale rhich can be definitely traced to this 3aper-slip idea is one made by a large 2hicago store . One morning shortly be-'ore Christmas the head of a large cor ) oration walked into this store with a ist of every customer with whom his iprporation did business , and a long list if personal friends , and explained that le wanted to send them all gifts of hailer-lash ery , but he did not want the bother " of making selections . In a ; port time he walked out again , leaving check for thirty thousand dollars ! The average small haberdashery store does lot sell thirty thousand dollars ' worth ) f stock in an entire year . Yet this store ! ompleted the sale in a few minutes with . ome little paper slips that represented lot merely merchandise , but some one 's magination about people and their attiude toward shopping . Mail-order houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of VOL . CXLIV. ? No. 860. - 32 certain types of articles by supplying their customers with imagination . The experience of a well-known mail-order jewelry house in connection with a little glass candle lamp forms a good illustration . The first season this candle lamp was described in the catalogue as a candle lamp , and priced at $1.50 . The next season an experiment was tried ? the price was quoted as , " pair , $3.00 ; singly , $1.50 . " There were almost as many orders for pairs that season as there had been for single candle lamps the season before . To carry the experiment still farther , attention was called in the catalogue the following season to the fact that four of these candle lamps made a most attractive table decoration , and the price was quoted thus : " set of 4 , $6.00 ; pair , $3,00 ; singly , $1.50 . " Observe that no reduction was made in the price ; yet that season there were many orders for sets of four , whereas before there had been practically no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as heavily as the single candle lamps had sold the first season . Of itself this experiment is of little importance , but as illustrating a fundamental principle of marketing it is of very great importance because it clearly shows the possibilities of raising the unit of sale in many lines of merchandise by the simple expedient of supplying the customer with imagination . Had a pair of the candle lamps been illustrated in the catalogue originally , instead of a single one , it is probable that a majority of the orders from the first would have been for pairs , for most people 's minds readily accept the pictures presented to them , since they lack the imagination to recreate or rearrange them for themselves . When it comes to the uses to which a product may be put , we find another great field for the application of imagination in marketing . It is not uncommon for manufacturers to advertise contests offering substantial cash prizes for suggestions for new or unusual uses of their products . Generally there is a double purpose behind these contests . One purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus supply them with more comprehensive imagination ; the other is to discover the.two or three ? or perhaps six or eight ? persons in the United States who have given the most thought to that particular product . It may be a woman in Nashville , Tennessee , who has done more kinds of cooking in a particular make of fireless cooker , or a man in Boston who has developed more unusual uses for a leather preservative than has anyone else , or a stock-room clerk in a Detroit automobile factory who has discovered that glass fruit jars of a certain type make the most satisfactory containers for the thousand or more small parts that must be carried in stock on his shelves . Whoever and wherever these persons are , they are worth finding , for frequently their imaginations have gone farther than the manufacturer 's own . Some of the uses developed by these prize contests are most interesting . A varnish company , for instance , found that on the alkaline plains of a certain Western state its varnish was used . extensively for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alkali , while in another section of the country it was used to coat watermelons to preserve them for winter consumption ! A company making a syrup for use on pancakes discovered that women were using this syrup instead of sugar for sweetening drinks and desserts . Since the war that practice has become quite common , but at the time it came as a great surprise to the syrup manufacturer . Another company which makes a preparation used for painting over cuts and breaks in the skin to protect them while they heal , learned that women were using a touch of its product on each shoulder to seal the shoulder straps of their evening gowns , and thus prevent them from slipping . An amusing case of imagination applied to a product by outsiders was the puzzling experience of a large company making , among other things , bright-colored celluloid penholders . Quite suddenly there was a noticeable increase in the orders for these penholders which the sales department was at a loss to explain . As the days passed the orders grew steadily larger , until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But still no explanation was forthcoming . Finally the company sent out sales scouts to find out where those penholders were going . Then it all came out ; millinery fashions called for feathers that season , feathers with colored quill points sticking boldly out of the hat crowns . Quill points in the brilliant colors of the feathers were not to be had , but some milliner 's imagination had suggested that colored celluloid penholders would do very well if the cork part intended to be gripped by the fingers when writing were removed . And so manufacturing milliners were soon buying these penholders by the thousands , stripping them out of their cork finger grips , and using them to trim hats . IL was fortunate for the company in question that it investigated carefully enough to discover this before ordering new machines , for the millinery fashion changed presently and the demand ended as suddenly as it had started . There is , of course , always a danger of applying faulty imagination to the merchandise one has to market . A case in point was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of money developing an automobile refinishing outfit to be marketed to the owners of motor cars , so that they could refinish their own cars and thus be independent of the paint shop and the professional finisher . This outfit contained paint for the body and hood , auto-top dressing , brase polish , brushes , sandpaper , etc . It wai a fine outfit ; the only trouble was that people would not buy it . The merchandise was good , but it had been put together with faulty imagination . After
