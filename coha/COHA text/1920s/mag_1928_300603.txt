On Dec. 1 , 1928 , John Smith , U. S. citizen , decides that he may as well collect some of the easy profits available on Wall St. 's bull market . From the bank he draws his life savings of $15,000 . A study of margins shows him that with this $15,000 and a friendly broker he can purchase $150,000 worth of stocks . From a study of market news he picks any five stocks which seem to be favorites of the bull operators . For example : Curtiss Aero , International Harvester , Montgomery Ward , Radio , Victor . So Speculator Smith speculates in 100 shares of each of these stocks . <P> Speculator Smith calculates that if , in the next week , these stocks each rise even only 20 points ( and all have been known to rise 20 points in a few hours ) he will have a profit of $10,000 . He feels akin to Arthur Cutten and the Fishers . <P> Unfortunately , the stocks do not rise . <P> The Market opens the week wavering , progresses into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the week Speculator Smith 's investments have shown the following results : <P> <P> Dec. 1 Dec. 8 Decline Stock closing closing Curtiss Aero 148 129 19 International Harvester 372 307 65 Montgomery Ward 420 340 80 Radio 376 296 80 Victor 138 114 24 1455 1186 269 <P> The market value of Speculator Smith 's stocks has dropped $26,900 . <P> Speculator Smith had committed the imprudence of buying at the top of a tremendous bull market which last week came to an end . In the last three days of trading the market value of listed securities fell off $6,000,000,000 . The average of 100 representative stocks ( compiled by the New York Times ) , fell off 15.61 points . In the last 10 minutes of the week 's trading , Radio broke 20 points , in the last three days market valuation of radio stock went from $485,268,000 to $341,998,400 . <P> What caused the collapse ? The immediate inciting force appears to have been " tight " money . Loans to brokers had advanced to $5,394,590,000 . Call money had climbed higher and higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the market , so long inflated , suddenly realized its unsound condition . Once the decline had begun , there was nothing to stop it . Indeed , as it continued , forced selling by many small operators with dwindling margins accelerated its fall . <P> The week closed with no signs of a rally . There were stories of a bankers ' conference in the offices of J. P. Morgan-stories that the bankers might support the market to prevent a stock panic . It was thought that " bargain hunters " ( shrewd traders who pick up stocks at low prices after a deflation ) would start a buying movement that would rally the market . On the whole , the bear market was considered a local hurricane , not at all reflecting the condition of the nation 's soundly prosperous industrial life .
