Many people are parents . Many parents are stupid . They do not know their children any better than they know the milkman . They are responsible for children being called such insulting names as kiddies , brats , little lambs , little nuisances . They either display their children to visitors like new phonograph records or put them in corners like broken bridge tables . The old practice of cuffing children has given way to almost complete indifference . Parents who can afford a nursemaid seldom see their small children more than once or twice a day . Then , when a child gets older he is sent away to school . He returns and finds his parents vaguely familiar , like the clock on the mantelpiece , and about as interesting as the 1913 volumes of the Atlantic Monthly on the bottom shelf of the bookcase . <P> There are also a few homes where children are reared so officiously that they never quite get rid of that run-to-mother look . Their parents are constantly trying out " systems " on them , nagging them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys and corrective devices ( such as aluminum rings to prevent sucking of thumbs ) . <P> Thus , parenthood- " the greatest profession on earth " - as sharp critics see it . If these critics had visited the Parents ' Exposition at the Grand Central Palace in Manhattan last week , they would have found little to contradict their previous observations . Exhibitions of groceries , toys , corrective literature , propaganda were there aplenty . Parents said : " Do n't touch that ; " and children clamored for ice cream . Then there arose a tiff between eminent parents ; the officials of the Parents ' Exposition , at the suggestion of New York Superintendent of Schools William J. O'Shea , refused to allow the American Birth Control League to exhibit its wares at . the Grand Central Palace . So the A.B.C.L. set up its headquarters across the street in a dirty little vacant restaurant , displaying the following placard : <P> FORCED OUT OF <P> The Parents ' Exposition , <P> The American Birth Control Exhibit <P> Is Now Here <P> COME IN <P> Mrs. Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her organization to Roman Catholic " bigotry and usurpation of power . " She said that Governor Alfred Emanuel Smith was at the bottom of it all , flayed him roundly in a public statement . <P> What the Parents ' Exposition lacked was an adequate demonstration of methods actually practiced by conscientious modern mothers . The nearest approach to this was a Co-operative Consultation booth , where parents were urged by a sign to " Come in and talk it over . " Individual problems were discussed and sound advice given . But , for conciseness , nothing at the exposition equalled the remark which one charming modern mother made as she was leaving the Grand Central Palace : " What do I do with my little boy ? Practically nothing . I read to him and he reads to me . I play games with him . When he acts up , I say to him : ' Hey , do you think that 's nice ? ' "                    @
