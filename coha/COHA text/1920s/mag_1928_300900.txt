The stack of straw votes accumulated at a cost of perhaps $1,000,000 by the Literary Digest ( weekly opinion collector ) is pointed to as one of the most momentous signs of the campaign . Last week , in its fifth installment , it showed Hoover ahead in 44 of the 48 states . The totals were : Hoover , 1,593,436 ; Smith 910,234 . The electoral votes thus far forecast were : Hoover , 488 , Smith , 43 . <P> A reason that the Literary Digest poll has received serious attention is that in 1924 it forecast the electoral votes received by President Coolidge with 99.44% accuracy . <P> Penetrating behind the electoral votes predicted in 1924 to the ratios of popular votes then predicted by the Literary Digest , Democrats last week pointed to wider margins of error . Dr Fabian Franklin , Manhattan economist-publicist , in a debate by letter with Editor William Seaver Woods of the Literary Digest , compared the predicted ratios of Davis and Coolidge votes in 1924 with actual ratios . In 22 states , the Literary Digest 's figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , put the Davis vote from 10% to 48% too low . Had the 1924 election not been a Coolidge landslide , contended Critic Franklin , these gross errors in popular vote would have been reflected in the electoral result . <P> Seizing upon last week 's Literary Digest figures and correcting them by factors of error in the 1924 straw vote , Chairman Raskob soon snowed his candidate easily carrying , for example , New York , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Illinois .
