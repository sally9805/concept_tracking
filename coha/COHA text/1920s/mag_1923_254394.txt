Mass meetings everywhere have raised once more the issue of universal manhood suffrage . It is a question of age and income . <P> Suffrage now is limited to male taxpayers of not less than 25 years of age . The press almost without exception supports the people in their demand that younger and poorer men be allowed to vote . The Kato government has opposed the demand , but has yielded to the extent of appointing a commission . <P> Meanwhile Tokyo is aroused by loud clashes between the Ken-Sie-Kai party ( pro manhood suffrage ) and the Taisho Red Heart League ( anti ) . And the people are at odds with the police .
