At Langbanshyttan , outside Filipstad , Vermland , Sweden , in the latter part of the seventeenth century a poor cripple living on the Jugstrom 's estate , while on his deathbed said that he had been visited by a wood-gnome who told him that for the kindness which had been shown to him all his life by the Jugstrom family there would be born to the family two boys whose names would be known the world over . Sofia Jugstrom , some time later , married Olof Ericsson and had three children : Karolina born 1800 , Nils born 1802 and John born 1803 . Nils , later made a baron , became a noted civil engineer who built canals , railroads and public works in Sweden . John always learned faster than his tutors could teach him . He possessed the impulse of genius and once his mind was set in any direction nothing could divert him from it . Before he was fourteen years old he was foreman on a section of the Gota Kanal with six hundred army engineers under him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool to raise him to the eye-piece of his theodolite ! In spite of the remonstrances of his friends , especially his mentor baron Baltzar Bogislaus von Platen , the builder of the Gota Kanal , who finally told him to " Go to the Devil , " and although Ericsson enjoyed the perfect confidence of his superiors and could look forward to a brilliant career as a canal constructor , he resigned his position and entered as ensign in the Jemtla.nd Rifles Regiment . At that time an officer was not occupied by his duties more than a comparatively short time of the year . Consequently Ericsson found ample time for further studies . During this period of his life Ericsson began his real career as an inventor . Ile began to consider the question whether steam coupd not be replaced by some other and cheaper motive power , a problem which thereafter occupied his mind during his whole life . As a result of his first attempts to solve the problem he invented his so-called Flame-Engine , which created great interest among the leading minds of the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England in 1826.  | There he met the Honorable Francis B. Ogden , United States Consul , who became a great admirer of his , and when Ericsson some years later showed him his design of a propeller and a working model in a tank of water and further trials on a larger scale , Mr. Ogden raised funds , to which he personally contributed , to construct a tugboat on the Thames River , forty-five feet long , eight feet beam and three feet draft with two propellers , for demonstration purposes . In 1837 Robert F. Stockton , U. S. N. retired , a resident of Princeton , N. J. , visited England to raise money for the Delaware and Raritan . Canal in New Jersey , in which his own and his family 's fortunes were invested . He called on Consul Ogden , who was also from New Jersey , and Ogden introduced him to Ericsson as a man who might be of value to him in designing machinery and vessels , not only for his canal but for the United States Navy . Ericsson invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francis B. Ogden , " and disclosed to him his ideas as to a new type of battleship to be built of iron instead of wood , to be driven by steam instead of the wind , and he then pointed out to him also the value of having a screw propeller instead of paddle wheels , thus enabling the engines and all the machinery to be below the water line safe from cannon shot . Stockton at once appreciated the merits of Ericsson 's ideas and accepted the invitation , and became so impressed with what he saw that he gave Ericsson an order for a tug-boat  | of iron , seventy feet long , ten feet beam , three feet draft and a fifty horse power engine with propeller direct connected . This was the first vessel so designed . On March third , 1839 , Congress passed a bill authorizing the building of three ships of war . There were no steam vessels in the navy then , and the naval officers opposed them , claiming that vessels could not be maneuvered in battle by steam power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for one of them , and that he would have Ericsson design it according to the plans they had discussed . On the strength of this assurance Ericsson built a working model of the engine and propeller , also a twelve inch gun of wrought iron with bands shrunk on , and resigning his position with the firm , he sailed for New York on board the " Great Western . " Arriving November twenty third , 1839 , he settled at the Astor House . The middle thirties of the last century saw Martin Van Buren President of this great nation , William L. Marcy , Governor of the State of New York , and Aaron Clark , Mayor of New York City . At the time , New York was sparsely settled above Canal street , and the section called Greenwich Village was only a thriving suburb . Stages plied between it and the Battery , carrying those who lived in the former down to business and back again every day . At this time there lived at three hundred and eighty seven Washington Street , one James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker whose daughter later married D. O. Mills of San Francisco . Cunningham established with Adam Hall the Phoenix Foundry on West Street . Associated with them were William DeLamater , confidential adviser , and Cornelius DeLamater . After Ericsson had located himself in New York , Mr. Samuel Risley , one of the Greenwich Village mechanics who had been recommended to him locally , became his draughtsman and proposed that he give his work to the Phoenix Foundry . In 1842 Stockton secured the order for the iron frigate which he named the " Princeton , " after his birthplace , and he commissioned Ericsson to do the engineering work of designing the engines and hull . The Princeton , so far as every detail of construction by Ericsson was concerned , was an absolute success . One of the saddest occurrences , however , in the history of the United States Navy happened on one of her trial trips , February twenty-eighth , 1844 . Ericsson had constructed in England , and brought with him to this country , a twelve inch wrought iron gun of his own design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunk on . It had been subjected to the severest tests . Stockton , however , wanted something of his own on the vessel and conceived the idea : of having a wrought iron gun of one piece from the largest forging that could be made at the Hammersley forge near Washington . Ericsson protested that the design was faulty , but Stockton insisted , and it was made and placed on the forward deck . Ericsson called his gun the " Oregon " after the state whose northern boundary at the time was under dispute with England . Stockton called his the " Peacemaker. "  | As the work proceeded , Stockton posed more and more as the man responsible for the design of the vessel , and Ericsson was relegated out of sight . In January , 1844 , Stockton brought the Princeton from Philadelphia to New York to receive the machinery which was made by Ericsson , and then prepared to sail for Washington , where he proposed to exhibit her to the government authorities as the most modern type of war vessel . Stockton took very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Ericsson the Princeton would stop for him at the Battery on her way to Washington . Ericsson was on hand at the place but the Princeton , with Stockton on board , forgot ( ? ) to stop and take Ericsson , the real creator of this modern war vessel , aboard ! The Princeton reached Washington safely , and Stockton invited President Tyler , his Cabinet , and the various departments of the government to visit him , and finally 127 gave a grand reception to all the authorities , including both Ilouses of Congress with their families . Over four hundred guests were on board , including the President , and several members of the Cabinet , the Congress , and many distinguished citizens . The vessel was gay with bunting , the weather was fine , and the occasion was made a gala day . She sailed down the Potomac to Mount Vernon . The guns were repeatedly fired . On the return , when about two miles from Washington , all hands were invited below for refreshments . Everybody was in high feather over the successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The three big guns of the Navy ? The Oregon , the Peacemaker , and Captain Stockton ? the greatest of which is the Captain . " At this , someone proposed that Captain Stockton fire his gun once more , but he refused , saying the demonstration was over . The Secretary of the Navy , Mr. Gilmer , was appealed to , and his acquiescence being deemed an order , instructions were issued accordingly . While arrangements were being made , several left the tables to witness the preparations . The entertainment proceeded , however , more toasts were drunk , one to the President ? and finally Mrs. Wickliffe , wife of the Postmaster General , proposed " The American Flag , the only thing American that will bear stripes " ? and then the firing of the gun was heard . After a silence there followed cries and groans . The gun had exploded with the most disastrous results . The Secretary of the Navy , Thomas W. Gilmer , the Secretary of State , Abel P. Upshur , Commodore Kennon , Chief of Construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Belgium , and Colonel David Gardner were killed instantly . Senator Benton of Missouri and fourteen sailors were more or less seriously injured . Captain Stockton himself , who stood on the breach of the gun , had his hair burned off and was thrown from his place and momentarily stunned . Meanwhile word was conveyed below of the extent of the terrible disaster and consternation fell upon the party , many of whom were suddenly bereft of their relatives ; It seemed that the President had been deterred from going on deck only by the offering of the toast in his honor , and his wife and son were attracted by a song which someone started , and stayed below . The Secretary of War , Mr. Wilkins , was on deck , but just before the gun was fired , remarked that he did not trust it and went to the stern of the vessel and so escaped injury .  | Ericsson was greatly affected by the news , which he received in New York ? first , of the complete assumption of credit for the design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself in that connection , and second , of the tragic result of Stockton 's insistence on making the contribution of his gun to the equipment of the vessel . But what was Ericsson 's dismay and indignation to learn later that Stockton had placed the blame for the disaster on him ! Ericsson 's friends were not slow in bringing to the attention of the authorities the evidence of his protests against the acceptance of the Stockton gun , but so strong was Captain Stockton 's influence in the Navy Department , that he prevented Ericsson from receiving any payment for his services or for the two years ' time spent in developing what was probably the greatest development in naval construction ever made at one time . So strong was the prejudice established by Stockton against Ericsson that the latter received no further orders from the government for nearly twenty years , and was almost prevented from saving the country at a most critical time . Ericsson had been put to the expense of travel and hotel accommodation in Philadelphia , the making of drawings and experimental machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have devoted to other work which would have remunerated him . To such extreme financial stress was he subjected that he gave up his quarters at the Astor House and rented a small house at ninetyfive Franklin street , where he moved with his wife and where , after deliberating over the situation , the latter de- idcd to return to her native land , England , till her husband could regain his financial footing . Unfortunately they never met again . Relieved of immediate distress by the generosity of Cornelius DeLamater , Ericsson set about redeeming his impaired reputation and finances . By this time the relationship between Mr. DeLamater and Captain Ericsson had become very close . Although Ericsson never held any financial interest in the works , Mr. DeLamater depended entirely upon Ericsson 's opinion in all engineering matters , and the latter looked to Mr. DeLamater to pass upon all questions of business entering into his various engineering ventures , and neither charged the other for the benefit of his advice . The works were open to Captain Ericsson to carry out his experiments without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawings or for services rendered to meet the demands of the works . The two men were like brothers throughout their lives , one depending upon the other 's strength to supplement his own weakness . In 1848 Ericsson , feeling himself a fixture in this country , became a naturalized citizen . He was five feet , eight inches tall , broad shouldered , and long bodied from his waist up , so that when sitting he gave the impression of being tall . He weighed one hundred and seventy-eight pounds and was extraordinarily strong . In 1858 , Mr. DeLamater changed the name of the works to The DeLamater Iron Works . In the spring of 1861 when the Civil War began to threaten , DeLamater was forty years old and Ericsson fiftyeight , and both were in prime vigor . They discussed the situation and set out to devote their potential means to serving their country . In 1854 , during the Crimean War , Ericsson had sent to Napoleon III a model and plans of a turreted armored war vessel . Napoleon did nothing with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ericsson a letter of acknowledgment and a large gold medal . Mr. DeLamater , knowing of this , went to Washington and conferred with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles regarding the building of armored vessels for the Navy .  | Meanwhile , Stephen R. Mallory , then Secretary of the Navy of the Confederacy , who had been a champion of Ericsson while chairman of the Naval Committee in Congress , proposed the building of iron clad vessels for the Confederate Navy . The old United States Frigate Merrimac , three thousand five hundred tons and with forty guns , had been abandoned and sunk at the Norfolk Navy Yard in April , 1861 , when Norfolk was captured . The Confederate Navy floated her , and had her covered with wrought iron . Word was spread that this armored vessel would capture every northern port , destroy the commerce and compel the surrender of Washington . Driven to action , Congress passed an act approving the building of several armored vessels and calling for designs and bids . Mr. DeLamater tried to persuade Ericsson to submit a design for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for Napoleon , but Ericsson realized the prejudice still existing against him in the Navy since the Stockton episode . He knew that the naval authorities were fully aware of his capabilities , and although they had invited all sorts of people who were politically in the limelight to assist them , they had totally ignored him , and he did not want to subject himself to the possibility of a rebuff . Mr. DeLamater argued that a letter addressed direct to the President would insure him a fair hearing , and accordingly a letter was written and dispatched to President Lincoln . This letter offered simply the services of Ericsson to his country in its time of peril , stressed the importance of steel-clad vessels to protect the northern ports , and the writer 's ability to cope with all naval engineering problems . In it Ericsson stated he sought no remuneration , and begged of the President :  | Please look carefully at the enclosed plans . You will find that the means I propose to employ are very simple ? so simple , indeed , that within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ready to take up a position under the rebel guns at Norfolk , and so efficient , too , I trust , that within a few hours the stolen ships would be sunk and the harbor purged of traitors . One of the first sets of plans recommended for adoption by the Board was presented by C. S. Bushnell , and he was awarded a contract to build the vessel known as the " Galena . " He consulted DeLamater , many of the naval men having doubted her ability to carry the stipulated amount of iron protective plate . Mr. DeLamater advised him to confer with Ericsson , whose opinion he was satisfied would settle the matter definitely and correctly . He called on Ericsson , laid the matter before him , and was requested to return the next day for his verdict . It was entirely favorable . Captain Ericsson then produced his duplicates of the model and plans of the iron clad steamer he had sent to Napoleon . He found a most willing champion in Bushnell , and gave him both plans and model to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy Welles was at Hartford , proceeded there by first train . The Secretary urged all possible dispatch to have the plans submitted before the Board , and the next day Bushnell was in Washington . He was joined by John A. Griswold and John F. Winslow , both of Troy , and friends of Secretary Seward . The latter gave them a strong letter to President Lincoln , who went with them to the Navy Department the next morning . Confronted with the novelty of the proposal , some advised trying it , while others ridiculed it , calling the model a " Cheese box on a raft . " It was at this conference that President Lincoln remarked : " All I have to say is what the girl said when she stuck her foot in the stocking : I t strikes me there 's something in it . ' " The next day , however , the Board condemned the plan . Bushnell labored with them , and won over Admirals Smith and Paulding , who promised to renort favorably if Captain Davis would join them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little thing home and worship it , as it would not be idolatry , because it was in the image of nothing in the heaven above , or on the earth beneath , or in the waters under the earth . "  | Bushnell felt the only way to succeed was to have Captain Ericsson present in Washington . He came to New York , saw Mr. DeLamater , and together they went to Ericsson 's home to interview him . The exact facts were not given to Ericsson , but he was told that some explanations were needed that he alone could make . He went to Washington that night . As soon as he appeared before the Board , he was told that his plans had been rejected . His indignation impelled him to withdraw at once , but he stopped long enough to ask why they had come to that conclusion . He was told that the vessel lacked stability . His technical skill being impugned , he explained with elaborate demonstration and so convincingly that Admiral Paulding said frankly and generously : " Sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you have said than I ever knew before . " Ericsson was told the next day by Secretary Welles that a contract would be awarded , and was asked to proceed at once with the work . Captain Ericsson worked day and night on the plans . The contract was signed October twenty-fifth , 1861 , the keel was laid by Thomas F. Rowland at the Continental Iron Works , Greenpoint , Long Island , on the same day . Steam was applied to the engines at the DeLamater Iron Works , December thirtieth . Captain Ericsson 's work during those three months was herculean . Not only the necessary labors , but the worries from continued doubts from Washington , required almost superhuman power . The " Monitor " left New York harbor March sixth , 1862 , commanded by Lieutenant Commander John L. Worden , arriving at Hampton Roads on the morning of the ninth , and before the sun set that day the world famous battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac was fought .  | The success of the Monitor naturally focused the attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and within a week they received a proposition to build six vessels of the same design but of various sizes , some of them much larger than the Monitor . The works became not only nationally but internationally known , and were a Mecca for inventors and promoters and anyone who had an idea to be developed . Many an impecunious inventor was welcomed there , encouraged , the difficulties under which he was laboring removed , and success brought to his efforts . Captain Ericsson died on March eighth , 1889 , nearly eighty-six years old . It was not until August twenty-third , 1890 , that arrangements were completed between the Swedish and United States governments for the removal of Captain Ericsson 's remains to his native land . New York City made the day notable . The New York Times of the following day devoted nearly a full page to its accounts of the occasion . Excerpts from its columns read : When the remains with the accompanying party came on board the cruiser Baltimore , Mr. George H. Robinson , speaking for the United States government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Schley , in the nation 's tribute to our illustrious dead , the simple duty falls to us to yield to the claims of his mother country , that she may again receive her son . We send him back crowned with honor , proud of the life of fifty years he devoted to this nation , and with gratitude for the gifts he gave us . " Was he a dreamer ? Yes . He dreamed of the practical application of screw propulsion , and the commerce of the world was revolutionized . He dreamed of making naval warfare more terrible and the Monitor was built . Again he dreamed , and the Destroyer with its submarine gun was born . He dreamed of the possibilities of obtaining power from air at high temperature , and behold ten thousand caloric engines . He dreamed of the sun 's rays in sandy deserts where water was hard to get , and the solar engine came ; and so he dreamed and worked for seventy years . "  |             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
