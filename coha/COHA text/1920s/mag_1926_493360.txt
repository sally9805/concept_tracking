Shepherding Who is more tender than a shepherd is , The intimacy of weathers in his face ? A fold , a serviceable staff is his : Out in the park or some like country place , Have I not seen one , in a golden air , On golden road , driving his flock before , A figure tall , hereditary , spare , And longed to follow to that kindly door ? It must be that some rich , forgotten thing Chokes at the heart at sight of these who pass ; Lost dreams gather about us in the grass ; And when this happens , for a moment we fling Our gold down , as it were but hoarded glass , And run back to our ancient shepherding .
