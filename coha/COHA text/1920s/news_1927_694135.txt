txt PARIS , Aug. ** who believe in isolation and non-interference in European affairs would be surprised if they could visit Paris at this time . They would find that America was as much isolated as a queen bee in full swarm with every worker and drone humming around her . Diplomatically , America is now far more the subject of French conversation than Germany , Russia , England or Italy . Philosophically and sociologically , every one in Europe , especially France , is worrying about America . No business discussion takes place without America getting a big share . France dances to American jazz . Paris urchins whistle Irving Berlin 's latest tunes . The French peasant plows , sows and reaps with American machinery . The French business man uses the American bank more and more freely . In this August holiday time the only news has been American news , and no Frenchman or woman has been able to get through the past week without discussing American affairs , such as President Coolidge 's announcement concerning his renomination , the American attitude at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noteworthy Ambassadors . This holiday month is one which contributes to good relations between France and America . Paris is full of tourists , but it is also full of buyers , come over especially to see the openings of the Fall fashion shows and pick the cream of the latest creations for the American market . These people for whom no official receptions are given , such as are reserved for airmen , editors and goodwill delegations , are noteworthy ambassadors . One good buyer is worth ten editors or twenty peace delegates in the eyes of any Parisian dressmaker and his hundreds of little assistants whose Winter 's work depends on the number of orders received . Some houses report the heaviest buying they have known for years . Others complain that business is not as brisk as in bright days of last year when France seemed so plentiful to those with dollars . No one , however , is complaining very bitterly , which is a good sign , both for the Paris sewing girls and that American womanhood will go this Winter clad in the latest Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter , maybe longer , and women will rediscover a waist line nearly corresponding to its anatomical location . Numerically , we are told , there are only half as many American tourists in France this year as last , when each dollar was worth twice as many francs as now , and those who went seeing Paris by night in autocars got for nothing the extra excitement of slight risk , being jeered and having pebbles thrown in their direction . There is talk of a big campaign to bring next year 's number back to last year 's record without giving more francs for the dollar . Now the interest in American afairs seems rather to be in an inVerse ratio to the number of American visitors . The day has passed wherein France 's interest in the transatlantic continent was only in tourists . In these last months a curious and subtle change has come over the whole relations between two continents . America Fills Front Page . Lindbergh , Byrd and Chamberlin had a hand in it .

For the second time In ten years America had come to France . And as was the case ten years ago , the first reaction of the French has been a quick , keen inquiry into the character , nature and intentions of this ally who has become so close a neighbor . The limelight has been turned on everything American . On Friday five columns out of seven on the front page of the biggest Paris morning paper were devoted to American affairs , one to the failure of the Geneva conference and America 's part therein , two to Governor Fuller 's decision approving the death sentence of Sacco and Vanzetti , and two to Drouhin and Levine and prospects of another transatlantic flight , this time from east to west .

In their absence the full blast of publicity has fallen on the heads of Governor Fuller , Mr. Levine and , fru an even more astonishing manner , . of Minister Gibson and his colleagues at Geneva . sst Riddles to the French . In trying to understand America and , be it added , in the full flush of her enthusiasm about Lindbergh and Byrd , France finds three riddles . Of these the first is " Why does America need as big a fleet as England ? " The second is " What kind of a man is the Governor of Massachusetts ? " and the third " What sort of business man or airman is Charles Levine ? " Now to those who know the answers , these riddles may present no appearance of difficulty . They have got every Frenchman guessing and guessing wildly .

In the days when the war debt discussion waxed hot , we used to hear all the time about " dollar domination . " For a century past English rule of the seven seas has been accepted by France , accepted as one accepts the mountain range or the wide river . France felt no rivalry and ultimately found security in her neighbor 's power . The French , therefore , liking established order when it has done them good and no harm , have felt in the Geneva discussions 1 that both peoples were playing with firearms of a particularly dangerous sort and the weight of French criticism has fallen on the proposer of the conference .

Lastly , there comes Levine . In the trio of riddles the French are trying to solve , this provides something of comedy . French weaknesses have come into play . Drouhin 's pride has been injured at the breath of a suggestion that he may not be ultimately taken as the pilot of the Columbia , and with his pride , of course , the whole national pride of France has risen . On the other side is the spectacle of a wealthy man trying to get his own way and both feeling and knowing himself a little out of his depth among foreigners he does not understand . To a business man , even in the air business , being something of an international figure has thus a disadvantage .
