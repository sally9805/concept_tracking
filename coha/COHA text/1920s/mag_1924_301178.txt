Vaporings . Since January last , when the experts designated by the Reparations Commission began their secret deliberations , mankind has been pestered with mad , wild guesses on the part of neurotic journalists who have professed to have unimpeachable information regarding the unvoiced thoughts of each individual expert . Alas , this harmless mental vaporing is now dmod ! Last week the experts presented their reports to the Reparations Commission which published them . <P> First Situation . The complex reparations tangle has been bound up closely with U. S. foreign policy . In December , 1922 , U. S. Secretary of State Charles E. Hughes made a speech- which was soon forgotten . Last October U. S. Ambassador-to-Britain George Harvey made his valedictory address to the Pilgrims ' Society in London and reminded Dame Europa that Mr. Hughes had made a speech and had offered to help her in that speech . The then British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon woke up and cabled to Mr. Hughes to ask if he really had made a speech offering to help Europe . His motive was to bring pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmative , but made four conditions to a prospective Economic Conference : <P> 1 ) That Germany must not be relieved of her responsibility for the War or her just obligations . <P> 2 ) That the findings of the Conference should be advisory and not binding on the interested Governments . <P> 3 ) That the question of the Allied debts to the U.

" <P> After a fortnight of bickering France poleaxed the conference idea by restricting its scope , or , in the words of Mr. Hughes , by making it " wholly futile and useless . " <P> Second Situation . It appeared that the prospect for an international conference was as dead as mutton when , a few minutes before its demise , Premier Poincar of France suggested ( through the Reparations Commission ) the formation of two committees of experts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. All international obstacles having been removed and at least temporary unanimity having been established between the Allies , Louis Barthou , Chairman of the Reparations Commission , invited the various financial and economic experts from the interested European countries and the U. S. to become members of the two committees . <P> The Report . In January the two committees began work . Now they have presented their reports . <P> No. 1 Committee ( Chairman Charles G. Dawes of Chicago ) , whose task was to stabilize German currency and balance the German budget , " recommended :
