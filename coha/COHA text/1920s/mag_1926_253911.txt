The Seventh Assembly of the League of Nations convened at Geneva last week and voted Germany within the League , but not until the minor nations concerned had protested the steam roller tactics of the great powers . The delegates continued amicably-minded while they elected Foreign Minister Nintchitch of Jugoslavia President of the Assembly but contention ensued thereafter . When Vice President Motta of Switzerland arose and moved the program , adopted by the League Council ( TIME , Sept. 13 ) , for the admission of Germany to the League , the resentment of the minor nations became sharply crystallized . <P> Protests . Dr. Fridtjof Nansen , famed Norwegian explorer , virile and impressive Viking , leaped to his feet and declared that he could not even hear the words of President Nintchitch from where the Norwegian delegation was seated near the back of the hall : " I demand a written statement of the proposals which are being moved and debated . ... It is proposed that the Council be enlarged by three semipermanent seats at the same time that Germany is admitted to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats for the aggrandizement of the larger powers over the smaller nations . . . . This is a great price to pay for a compromise among the powers on the admission of Germany . " <P> After similar speeches of restrained but vigorous protest by Dr. Unden of Sweden , Jonkheer J. Loudon of the Netherlands and others , an oral vote was called . <P> " Aye ! yes ! oui ! " One of the first to respond as the alphabetical roll was called was the Australian delegate who shouted a cheery " Aye ! " It was explained to the French tellers who understood only English English that " aye " meant " yes . " Forthwith the voting proceeded with naught heard but " yes " or " oui " At the 48th affirmative President Nintchitch announced that Germany had been unanimously elected to membership in the League of Nations and to a permanent seat on the League Council . <P> Before Secretary General Sir Eric Drummond of the League could telegraph the news to Berlin , thousands of German radio fans had already heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forthwith the German delegation headed by Foreign Minister Stresemann and Count von Bernstorff left Berlin for Geneva in three special cars attached to three separate trains . Thus the extravagance of a special train and engine was prudently avoided . <P> Sensible words . As Herr Stresemann strode into the Assembly at the head of the German delegation a cheer went up from Mrs. Woodrow Wilson , Ignace Jan Paderewski , Senator Claude Swanson , and many another who sweltered in the gallery . Replying to the formal greeting of President Nintchitch , Herr Stresemann mounted the Tribune , mopped his pinkly bald head , planted his legs firmly , joined his hands somewhat nervously behind his back , launched into a sound and sensible discourse in German : <P> " Today Germany enters the circle of States to some of which she has been attached by untroubled ties of friendship whereas others were allied against her during the Great War . It surely is an event of historical importance that Germany and these latter States are now brought together within the League of Nations for permanent and pacific cooperation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
