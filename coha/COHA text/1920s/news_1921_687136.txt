txt While the Lannards were struggling with the arrangements preliminary to the Marriage of Muriel ' Lannert to Count Boris Koinokoff , Harry Bacon had put many leagues between himseltand that family . - Before leaving he gave the manager of his estate a private telegraphic code , as well as certain explicit directions . " I 'll probably communicate with you before long , " he added , " but do not worry if you do n't hear . Meanwhile , try to pick upeas much Lannard Steel as you can . " A few hours later he was- driving la second hand Ford along the Jersey roads . His attire was that of a workman , and included a cap and an army shirt . In his coat lapel was a service button . He carried a sum of money in a wallet , which he kept in the inside pocket of his coat . Beneath his vest was another and much larger sum . It was his first move in the plan of action which for some time had been revolving in his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , and if the slightest ache of disappointed love lurked in his heart there was ne sign of it in his face . The rhythmic throb of the motor conduced to reflectiveness . " Here I am , " he thought , " suddenly deluged by a huge fortune . Most men unused to money are ruined by sudden riches . I wonder if I will be an exception ? If I lose my head I am gone . " Many young men in my position would start in and get as much action on the money as possible  --  a yacht , a town and country house , de luxe automobiles , a racing stable , two or three scandals , a few breach of promise suits , and wind up with a staggering bill for alimony : , There would be a thousand greedy vultures on my trail . I could never tell who were my real friends . I could n't marry a girl without fearing it was not me , but my money she wanted . " One- thing sure , I 'm going to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , my agent would like to see me settle down and double the estate . Not ' for me . Why get caught on the treadmill of money making ? That disease is worse than not having anything . " Ahead of him , walking wearily along the road , was a man . Bacon slowed down. , " Want a ride ? " he called . " Sure , " answered the man , climbingin . , " I 've hiked about a thousand kilometers since noon and my ' dogs ' are beginning to fret . " ? He was somewhat over 30 , shabbily dressed , and with trembling hands . " Now , if I had a cigaret I 'd be happy . " Bacon produced one , and asked : " How far you going ? " " No particular objective . A man named Greeley advised me to go west , and beyond that I have n't plotted out my itinerary . " Bacon glanced at him . " Are you a college professor ? " The man laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a wayfarer who has lost his way . " Before Harry could reply the stranger seized the initiative . " Where are you bound for ? " ho asked . " 0 , I 'm out on the trail of a job . " " Do you always go job huriting in your car ? " inquired the stranger with exaggerated politeness . Bacon laughed . " You 're a , queer bird , " he said . " Are you broke ? " " One hundred per cent . If rubles were down to dollar a million , I could n't scare up a ' copeck . " They , rode on in silence for a time . At length  --  Bacon said : " I think I can help you if you stick along with me . " ' ' Thank you , brother . I 'm the Le Page brothers . I 'll stick . " DarknesS overtook them as they drove into a little town . Running the car . into the yard of a small , ill favored hotel , the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up suspiciously . " , Our terms are 42 ? in advance , " he announced , unpleasantly . Bacon drew out his wallet and extracted two $1 bills from an impressive roll . The attitude of the hotelkeeper became instantly obsequious . As for the stranger , his eyes bulged out as he noted the size and color of the roll , After a miserable meal the two men were shown to a double room , where the stranger soon was in bed . Bacon silent a few moments writing on a slip of paper , which he thrust into his wallet . He then flung his coat on a chair and was presently fast asleep . The stranger lay awake , staring up into the darkness .
