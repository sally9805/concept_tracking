Excitement is risky for octogenarians , and so last week in Geneva , Switzerland , august elder U.S. Statesman Elihu Root , 84 , was kept in bed for two whole days by his vigilant and cheery nurse , Miss Emily Stewart . As the personal representative of President Herbert Hoover , Elder Statesman Root had just scored an exciting triumph . After wrestling with the League of Nations committee on the World Court Protocol for 14 days-with a two-hour nap at his hotel every afternoon-he has achieved acceptance of a formula under which the U.S. Senate is expected at last to ratify the protocol for U.S. adherence to the Court . <P> The Root Formula ( TIME , March 18 ) is a polite rephrasing of the U.S. Senate 's notorious " Reservation V , " drafted to provide for U.S. adherence only on condition the Court would not , without U.S. consent , render " an advisory opinion touching any dispute or question in which the United States has or claims an interest . " As finally approved by the League Committee , last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " With a view to insuring that the court shall not , without the consent of the United States , entertain any request for an advisory opinion touching any dispute or question in which the United States has or claims an interest , the Secretary General of the League of Nations shall , through any channel designated for the purpose by the United States , inform the United States of any proposal before the Council or Assembly of the League for obtaining an advisory opinion from the World Court and thereupon , if desired , an exchange of views as to whether an interest of the United States is affected shall proceed with all convenient speed between the Council or Assembly and the United States . . . . <P> " If after the exchange of views it shall appear that no agreement can be reached and the United States is not prepared to forego its objection , the exercise of its powers of withdrawal from the World Court will follow without the imputation of unfriendliness or unwillingness to cooperate generally for peace and good will . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. entirely free to divorce the World Court instantly at any time after the diplomatic marriage takes place . A novelty is the provision for direct , official communication between the U.S. State Department and the Secretariat of the League-an avenue of communication which does not exist at present . The form of protocol approved last week will now be submitted to the Council of the League , to the 52 states adherent to the World Court , and to the U.S. Senate-assuming , of course , that no previous hitch occurs . Last week in Washington such irreconcilable Anti-Courters as Senator William Edgar Borah re-trumpeted their opposition , but President Hoover was expected to favor and secure ratification .
