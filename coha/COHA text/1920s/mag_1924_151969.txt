Curious heads along the curious streets of Jeddah , port of Mecca , craned to see Husein , abdicating King of Hejaz* and Calif of Islam ( TIME , Oct. 13 ) . It was announced that Husein would sail away-none knew whither . <P> In Mecca , AH , the son of Husein , strove to keep the crown in the Hasbinite family by stout resistance to the raids of the Wahabi tribesmen .

He has delightful manners , great personal charm , and is an accomplished diplomat . He is deeply religious , the essence of generosity , and a martinet on all questions of morality . Like the other members of his family , he has far-reaching views and aspirations for his country . But he has no personal aspirations beyond the Emirate of Mecca , to which he will in all probability , fall heir to the death of his father . " <P> He has not had to await the death of his father for the Emirate of Mecca . As King of Hejaz , he is automatically Emir of Medina , the place to which the profet of Mohammed fled from Mecca to escape his enemies , where he died and where he is buried . <P> * Hejaz or Hijaz is classical Arab for barrier : hence in its geographical significance it denotes Judiasm and Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
