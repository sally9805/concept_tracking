At Sea Bright , N. J. , one evening last week , a village policeman spied seven nude girls bathing in the Atlantic Ocean . He cried out at them . One of them retorted : " Go look at the law , will ya ? " He did . The law specifically prohibited nude bathing from 6 a. m. to 9 p. m . It was after 9 p. m . <P> Sea Bright 's councilmen soon summoned , amended the law .
