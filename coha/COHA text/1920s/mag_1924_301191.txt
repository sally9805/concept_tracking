Sitting Pretty . A musical comedy by Guy Bolton , P. G. Wodehouse , Jerome Kern . Its chief concern is to rouse interest in a millionaire who has unwittingly adopted a young crook and who wants to marry him off to a hand-picked mate . The lyrics , smooth , adroit , prettily rhymed and easily audible , are its only saving grace . Queenie Smith , with her 48 inches of saucy gaminerie , is the biggest asset . She dances like a sunbeam , stopping the show , whenever she gets in motion . Her acute low comedy sense almost twists most of her lines into a laugh . Frank Mclntyre , aside from one genuinely funny song about Sing Sing , manages to carry a comedy role by sheer weight . The rest of the company are adequate . The settings and costumes are smart . <P> Two Strangers from Nowhere . They might as well return from the place whence they came . The author , Myron C. Fagan , seems to have turned Devil 's advocate , for no reason at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sending an erring wife back to her struggling husband , and of reproving characters whenever they speak unkindly of their Maker . At times the play sounds like Faust being run backwards . It is simply propaganda for the author 's private views on practically everything . Fritz Lieber in the leading role is enamored of his interminable speeches . It is a case of the drooling passion . <P> Helena 's Boys . Mrs. Fiske , eternally and fragrantly youthful in her own spirit , has gone to the side of those playwrights who devote three acts to putting the younger generation over their knee . One of the widow Helena 's sons is a young shrub who is in danger of being plucked from preparatory school for loudly summarizing a patriotic address as " Bunk ! " The other writes for a magazine ai which free love is the burning creed . The widow 's prescription for curing them of the New Freedom is as follows : <P> Take a large drink of cider , brazenly paraded as whiskey , and mix with the constitution of a hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very theories her children have been declaring . <P> When very drunk , let her calmly suggest living in illicit arrangement with a prosaic manufacturer who has been courting her with bovine persistence . <P> After swallowing this , the two sons are nauseated with their own medicine and quickly reform . <P> The audience gets sickish , too . While there is much genteel jocularity in Ida Lublenski Ehrlich 's play , its point can be seen several blocks away . When attained , it hardly seems worth panting after . Mrs. Fiske is her usual sparkling , irridescent self . <P> Provincetown Theatre . Messrs . Eugene O'Neill ( dramatist ) , Robert Edmond Jones ( artist ) and Kenneth Macgowan ( author ) have rounded out their best experimental bill to date and have established the place of their little theatre-doing things well that would not be done at all-anywhere else .
