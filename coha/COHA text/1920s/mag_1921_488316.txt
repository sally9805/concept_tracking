R. HOOVER let his darling child , the handpicked Unemployment Conference , march right up to hang its clothes on the hickory limb , but never did he let it go near the water wherein no man knows how many jobless Americans are likely to perish before the winter is over . Which is to say that the Unemployed Conference was debarred at the very beginning from considering unemployment insurance or any scheme of government doles , to say nothing of more radical measures . Its zeal for minimizing the extent of unemployment makes one suspect the accuracy of its figures which purport to show that it is necessary to provide emergency help of some sort for " only one fifth " of the unemployed , that is , not more than 1,000,000 men . The conference from which all radicals were carefully excluded , achieved a formal unity by the simple device of not passing as a whole on committee reports when there was a difference of opinion between Mr. Gompers and the employers . Nevertheless it doubtless did something to increase the amount of money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it left behind a kind of clearing house under the direction of that able executive Colonel Arthur Woods . On the whole , the Conference gave the employers one more chance to make good their boast that they can manage all the problems of our modern industrial order if only they are let alone . T is not only the railroads which have adopted the plan which the New York World rightly calls " putting the whole burden on labor . " Consider the Standard Oil Company and the Steel Corporation . Both have won some praise by announcing substantial additions to their plants to be constructed so far as possible by their own men who would otherwise be unemployed . But the Standard gets the $2,000,000 it is to spend at Bayonne by dropping the bonus paid until recently to its workers . And the Steel Trust gets its $10,000,000 by a 30 per cent wage cut recently put into effect . According to figures presented to the Unemployment Conference the wages of the steel laborers have risen fifty points since 1913 , while the cost of living has risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills for the companies ' efforts to relieve unemployment . Yet not they but the companies will own the new factories that are to be built . T WO recent events in the labor world are of more than usual significance . The first is the announcement of the successful federation of various independent unions among the textile workers . The industrial revolution began in the manufacture of textiles and from that day to this the condition of textile workers and their scale of wages have left a great deal to be desired . In America the field has been largely unorganized . The orthodox A. F. of L. body , the United Textile Workers , has seemed to the mass of the workers neither aggressive nor resolute in. pushing their interests . The I. W. W. has staged some dramatic strikes but has failed to organize effectively . Hence the multitude of independent unions of which the Amalgamated was the strongest . This new federation , which it is hoped the United Textile Workers will join , ought to prepare the way for effective organization even in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is less encouraging . President Lewis of the United Mine Workers has deposed Alexander Howat , president of the Kansas miners . The reason he alleges is Howat 's support of a strike said to violate an agreement with the employers . We are sympathetic with every effort to maintain good faith in labor organizations , but it is to be feared that Mr. Lewis is less inspired by morals than by jealousy of a rival who has proved more courageous in standing for the workers ' rights . Whatever his faults , Mr. Howat has had a sure instinct for real justice in fighting the Kansas industrial court as an unfair and impossible device for ending the industrial conflict . The very strike which at present prevails is not directed against the operators but against the court itself . This open war among the mine workers , whoever may be to blame , is one more evidence of a disquieting disintegration in labor ranks at a time when the anti-union campaign is at its height .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
