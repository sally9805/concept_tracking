The heavy Gothic doors of the cloister trembled , slowly closed , were locked . Inside remained 15 quiet women dressed in white robes , wearing black hoods and capes , carrying rosaries , like strings of beads , with a pendant crucifix . They were nuns of the Dominican Sisterhood , located at Corpus Christi Monastery in Menlo Park , California . They had pledged themselves to the perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament , to obedience , poverty and chastity . Never may they leave the cloister ( except because of fire , leprosy , contagious maladies , or analogous circumstances ) . <P> " Bernard loved the valleys , Benedict the mountains , Francis the towns , Dominic the populous cities " - but the sisterhood established in St. Dominic 's name , lead solitary , meditative lives , hearing not even overtones of the thronging metropolis . Last week , at Menlo Park , this renunciation of the world began with the dedication of the chapel by San Francisco 's famed Archbishop Hanna . With special mass and a Feast of the Dedication the nuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mellow chiming of bells echoed from the vaults . The ceremonies over , the portals of the cloister were sealed . Henceforth the nuns ' only communication with friends or relatives is by mail or through the solidly grated windows of the cloister parlor . <P> Superstition has it that nuns who break their vows are subjected to ghastly Gothic penalties , such as burial alive in the walls of a monastery . Superstition errs ; the apostate nun undergoes no stipulated censure . If she suffers at all it is from the barb of conscience or the irrelevant condemnation of busybodies . Having obtained a dispensation from Rome she may even re-enter the cloister , no matter what prompted her to abscond . Penitent , she is easily forgiven . <P> Florence Hayes , 20-year-old niece of Cardinal Hayes , took vows and became a member of the Sisters of St. Francis , situated at Mount St. Clare , New Hamburg , N. Y. Hereafter she will be known as Sister Michella Marie . The Cardinal assisted .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
