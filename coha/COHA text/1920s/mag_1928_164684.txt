Many a dubious Democrat has mumbled gravely , " I am a Democrat , " when asked if he would bolt Nominee Smith . Robert Latham Owen , oldtime Democrat , visited Hoover headquarters in Manhattan last week and announced distinctly : " I am in favor of Herbert Hoover . " Then he read a long , prepared laudation of the Hoover career and character . He was asked if he felt , as a Democrat , that he could not stand for Nominee Smith . " I wo n't stand for him ! That 's worse ! " cried Bolter Owen . " I am an American citizen and not a coward . I 'll be damned if I 'll stand for the Tammanyizing of the Government of the United States ! " Nominee Smith took the news calmly . Bolter Owen used to have , and might again have , a large following . " Naturally , I am sorry , " said Nominee Smith . ... " ... My greatest regret comes from one of the reasons advanced , because it compels me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen called to see me at the Manhattan Club and asked me to use my influence to secure for him the support of the Tammany delegation and stated that , with that support , he felt he could get considerable delegates from other States for himself as a candidate for the nomination for President . . . . " This reply did not dim the joy of Senator George Moses , the Hooverizer beside whose desk Mr. Owen was standing when he performed his " bolt . " Senator Moses presented Mr. Owen to newsgatherers thus : " Gentlemen , behold the representative of the aroused Democratic sentiment in the border states . " And Mr. Owen answered Nominee Smith by saying : " I was never a serious candidate for President and there never was any likelihood that Tammany would support me . " The chief significance of " bolts " lies in the volume of votes which they may involve . The volume they represent is a less ponderable matter , especially when the bolter is out of office . Mr. Owen , part Cherokee Indian , is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to Oklahoma , with which State his name has long been connected , when he was still young and the region was a Territory . He grew potent , first as an Indian agent , then as one of Oklahoma 's first U. S. Senators ( 1907-25 ) . As a member of the Senate Finance Committee he helped frame the Federal Reserve and Farm Loan Acts . His horizon was widened by his experience on the Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee . He became an intimate of President Wilson . After the War , his interests definitely transcended Oklahoma affairs . He had an organized boom to inherit the Wilson mantle at the National Democratic Convention of 1920 . He all but joined the La Follette movement four years later , after his " not serious " desire for the Democratic nomination had been balked a second time . " I am and always have been an Insurgent , " he once said . In 1925 , Mr. Owen left politics and entered the employ of Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair . He went abroad and after inspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all War blame . When he came home he settled down in Washington . His Oklahoma days were over and he now looks back on them much as returned and retired Englishmen revive their careers in the British provinces and colonies . From the point of view of actual votes , the Owen " bolt " seemed far less important , last week , than another departure from the
