BEGOTTEN in the splendor and flame of the summer sky , born with shuddering in the gloom of the hive , bees and men come much alike by life , the bee no less magnificently out of the dust , no more abjectly from the spheres . Lower in scale of being , possibly . than human life , bee life , nevertheless , has developed not only a perfect political organization , but founded it upon an equally perfect society ? division of labor , divorceless marriage , obedient children , and a method of birth control that would absolutely insure the war-resorting hu ? man race against its certain suicide . Either we must find some purpose for human life in Nature 's plan not con ? templated for the bees , or else conceive of man as a cruel mistake , an ironical unfinished experiment , abandoned by Nature while working out the perfect life of the bee . And nowhere is this dif ? ference between men and bees so great as in their begetting and birth ? as in the marvelous body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat here at my desk all day with two queen bees in my bosom . I heard the buzz of their wings , I felt the warmth of their breath , but I felt even more the miracle of their beings . They were lovely young creatures , golden Italian stock , which I had imported from a famous bee ranch in a neighboring state ; but as you looked at them they seemed hardly larger than workers . They were whole , however , and had come to me after their wedding flight in the sky . They came by post ; each accom ? panied by half a dozen workers ; each with her retinue in a small wooden-and ? wire house which was fully two inches square and half an inch high , and well stocked with " queen-candy . " The weather was so cold yesterday that I did not dare open the hives to introduce the newcomers , so I kept them warm in my pocket , and have just now slipped their tiny traveling houses into the queenless cities , very much as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come quietly among the children . Prisoners they are too , and must be for a while , else the excited and angry throngs will kill them . They can neither escape from their cages nor can any bee of the colony get into them until I am ready . I had previously taken the reigning queens away from these two hives , because one of the queens was failing , and one was cross cross-bred , with a waspish temper which was being inherited by her waspish offspring , sour-grape children with teeth ? on edge . Queenless now for two days , a day more may alarm them into accepting the new mothers ; and by that time , not out of fear , some think , but because of the emanating fragrance of her perfect body , the healing , unifying incense of life , like a spell upon their multitude , they will forget that she was ever strange . But to-day they were only sore , and pounced upon the cages , trying to tear the wire walls down and rend the foreigners . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire . In one end of each tiny blockhouse is bored a hole for an entrance , which is stuffed with candy and covered outside at the vestibule with a strip of cardboard , for a storm door . Immediately the cage was introduced the mob began gnawing away this door . They will gnaw all day and all night , and biting the cardboard off , will come to the long passage plugged with stiff candy . Only one bee can gnaw in here at a time , and it will take , altogether , two days to get through to the queen , by which time the frightened stranger will have become calm , and in some mysterious manner will have calmed the people ; and the anger of the mob subsiding , common sense will pre ? vail , the crowd will disperse , and up and down the streets , till it echo from every peopled wall , will be heard the cry , " The Queen is dead ! Long live the Queen ! " ? the first worker to penetrate the cage coming with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kiss upon her lips . To-morrow I shall remove the crude containers of this magic freight , close up the separated brood-frames , and . put the roof back on the quiet city . In a few weeks I shall see two mingling streams of bees issue from each single flowing fountain : a wide black stream , and a yellow thread of a stream winding through it , as when some brook darts laughing into the dark side of a river moving slowly toward the sea . This is early September . What time the golden ? rod and boneset are done blooming , the diminishing black stream will shrivel in the thirsty autumn sun , while the yel ? low current , swelling daily and pouring ever purer , will flow down to the astered leas of October in a golden flood out of the golden fount ? the single queen-mother in the hive . But a slight blunder at this moment ? bungling hands are mine to handle the affairs of these winged fairy folk ! ? and things may end fatally for the new queen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper of a queenless city is highly excitable ; the population , restless and over-wrought at their unhappy situation , are so expec ? tant of danger that at the least alarm they rush into violence , as liable to fallupon and do to death their new mother as they are likely to accept her . One who has never seen a queen die , a young beautiful queen , has yet to see one of the most terrible manifestations of mob rage , under control of custom , that can be found in nature , whether wild or human . For even in their blind fury the bee-people can not escape the discipline and the decrees of the hive . It is the law of the nation that the queen die by edict of the state , after a fashion reserved for her alone , with pomp and fearful circumstance . In the defense of the hive , when at ? tacked from without , the ordinary and most effective weapon used by the bees is the sting , each defender in the emer ? gency acting alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . Nature has armed the sting with short recurving barbs , like fish-hooks , which enter easily , but which can not be torn loose , so that the thrust of the fatal lance is doubly fatal : the sting remain ? ing in the enemy 's body , and tearing away the end of the defender 's body after the deadly stroke . For this reason the sting is never used inside the hive as an instrument of discipline , not even for the massacre of the drones , nor in the state execution of the queen . When the drone 's hour strikes ( and it is certain to strike ) one of his savage sis ? ters darts upon him , seizes him by the base of the wing , and dragging the poor bellowing booby toward the door of the hive , manhandles him horribly . Pulling , hauling , shoving him , she all the while chops furiously at the slender wing stem in her cutting jaws , and thrusts him wail ? ing into outer darkness , one wing gone , perchance , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bee garden to ? day . The goldenrod flow was at flood . Every cell was brimmed . Opulence and confidence prevailed over the lean anxie ? ties of the summer . Drones were a drug on the market , useless furniture ? and the pogrom was announced . The slaugh ? ter was sweeping ? fright alone , I think , killing hundreds of them as they were bundled , quite unmaimed , out of the hives . It is different with the queen , though not less terrible . Let her grow old , or for any reason falter when she should be strong , and steps are immediately taken to supersede her . Queen cells are started , and as soon as the virgin mon ? archs begin to emerge word for the exe ? cution is given . Who gives it , what aides carry it , what tone or color it wears , we know not . But we know who attends to its execution . Those who have fed her , groomed her , caressed her , urged her tenderly from cradle to cradle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather deep round her , throng her , embrace her , cover her , hold her closer and closer in a smother of lov ? ing arms , till , gasping for breath , she faints , and with folded wings and limbs composed , falls from their embrace like a withering flower from its stem . The queen is not common clay . She is set apart from her birth , dedicated from the third day of her existence to love and life by special dispensation ? from the first day , indeed , if the egg en ? folding her is placed , immediately when laid , within the queen cell . The bees have- discovered an elixir which they feed to the queen , extending her life im ? measurably past their own , up to and beyond the fifteenth generation , a span in human terms mounting toward a thousand years . Nature also has a hand in this prolonged existence , engrafting in her body , at the time of her union with the drone , a vital organ from his body containing millions of sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some part in her more than mortal power . She may live six years , mothering three genera ? tions a year , each generation like the needles of the pine tree for multitude . Out of her body , egg by egg , one at a time , she may beget a million . Queen and mother and more : she is the incar ? nate principle of life , potent beyond measure , immaculate in her mating , and except for the thin shell of body , life 's essence sublime and pure . I take her in my hand and hold her like a pulsing particle of radium , a frag ? ment of the universal heart whence flow the streams of being : breath , and mind , and love , and motion . She is radiant of life , ambient , encompassing , complete . In her I hold a first cause , a bit of primal power , and might almost behold it move within the void and hollow of my hand . And I have seen it move . I have seen the queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of Life within her , making out of inanimate royal jelly myriads of animate eggs . But I did not see Life animate them , nor understand why it could Only endow them first with drone life . I saw it choose one , a drone egg , and put it into a drone cradle ; then choose another , the next one on its passage to the comb , and dart into its end a flashing , blinding javelin , a single sperm cell loaded with different life ( bee life , but less or more I saw not ) , and out of the drone egg produce a worker bee , out of the male a female , out of the ribs and clay of Adam make again the woman Eve . At the very inception of the queen we are faced with so deliberate a purpose and such incredible power over Nature , as almost to shake our faith in the im ? mutability of life 's fundamental laws . If we knew what the bees know of the chemistry of foods and the virtues of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dwarfs , wizards , geniuses , and men like gods . When the bees need a. queen they make her . They start a cell twice the size of a worker cell , cutting away the brood comb to make room for it and into it , glued to the inverted bottom , is put a " fertile , " which means a worker , egg . This is an ordinary egg taken from a worker cell , where , had it not been re ? moved , it would have hatched out an or ? dinary worker bee . For three days ( until it hatches ) this egg in no wise differs from its original shape , nor does it acquire any extraordinary virtues . It is in all respects what it was when it was laid in the worker cell . Then it hatches into a minute grub , and immediately the miracle of making over nature , of en ? dowing her with gifts and graces , of com ? pelling her to rise to a higher power , begins . It is well , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowledge like theirs dare not be in ? trusted to human hands . What hap ? pens now is a thing to fear . The moment she hatches , the young grub is attended by nurse bees who feed her for the first three days on the milky royal jelly , precisely as they feed the worker grubs ; but at the end of the third day this special food is denied the worker grub , whereas for two days more the royal grub has it poured upon her until she literally floats in it , her body so stimulated by this fifth day of her grub-life ( eight days from the laying of the egg ) she begins to spin a silken mantle , a placental shroud , to wrap about her for a mystical , seven-day sleep , the profound gestating slumber from which she will awake , twice-horn , this time a winged creature , and a bride and queen . The bees safeguard and seal the royal chamber with many wafers spun of silk and wax . They weave the cell of the same fabric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive can freely blow upon it and pour sweet and fresh through the porous walls to the deep-breathing sleeper with ? in . This freer breath , this ampler room , this richer , more abundant food on the fourth and fifth day of the larval life ? this , so far as we know , is the difference , the sole difference , between the making of a worker and a queen . On the fourth and fifth day of the worker 's larval life the royal jelly is cut of and little but honey , and but little of that , is fed her . She falls upon her sleep on the same day as the queen , but sleeps on until the twenty-first day from the laying of the egg ; whereas , on the fifteenth day the queen is awake in her cell and demand ? ing to be free . She is imperative , some ? times calling , " quawk ! quawk ! " which can be plainly heard as you work amongthe combs . If the moment is propitious ( the colony determines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seals of her door , the impatient prisoner cutting from the inside at the fastenings , and as the circular portal swings back on its silken hinge , behold the queen-mother ? and the miracle ! For that which issues never entered that queen cell , not if what comes out of the worker cell is what went in for these two embryos were identical , both worker eggs , destined to have hatched out worker bees , had one not been trans ? ferred to the cradle of a queen . Now we have a queen from one ; from the other a worker ; different creatures in size , shape , function , desire and destiny ; and also in anatomy ; each having parts not possessed by the other , the original iden ? tical patterns in the eggs changed in the short process of development , details added to the first design , others scanted and discarded , the whole plan in the one case or the other , redrawn ; but whether queen or worker , who can tell ? Which was the archetype stamped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the film when the shadow of the drone dissolved ? Was it worker ? Was it queen ? Plastic stuff , this protoplasm of bees , and men , and amoebas . Wet clay ! And the Potter at the wheel , how pa ? tiently he has shaped and reshaped the lump . But how inevitably he has touched every piece with beauty , and breathed upon it all the immortal breath of life ! The virgin queen comes Corti ' from the cell with a firm free step , fully clothed and capable ; not like the worker , drag ? ging herself out with the help of nurses , a pallid , trembling ghost as from a tomb . Longer , brighter in color , more mature in appearance than the worker ( though rising from her sleep six days earlier ) , the new-hatched queen has parts and powers so different from the worker 's as might seem to place her in a different insect order . A greater gulf is fixed between these two females than that which sep ? arates male and female of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ductive organs ( little more than ves ? tiges in the worker ) , has a special organ , the spermatheca , wherein she carries the spermatozoa of the male , no rudiment or sign of which is found in the worker . On the other hand , she has no wax disks between the plates of her body , no hol ? low thigh for a bread-basket , no corolla-probing tongue , no straight deadly lance ( hers being curved and quite useless ) . Her eyes have thousands fewer facets than the worker 's ; and in her abdomen are only four nerve ganglia to the work ? er 's five . Wings she has , but only for her wedding flight and when the colony swarms ; for though a honey bee , she will never sway from a head of mint , nor scale the sunshine down the scented fields , nor share an hour of the worker 's daily round . Hers is the dusk of the hive , the cradled combs , the loom of birth , weaving , weaving , back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life . Yet this is only half the truth , if in ? deed it is so much as that My hives are full of partial truths ? like my friends , like the books on my shelves , the experiences of my life , and the words of my pen . One grub steps forth a queen , and one is dragged out a slave , branded in her narrow cell with the hot iron of toil . But these words lie , try as they will to be honest . If Satan be the father of lies , then language is their mother . I have never found a word that could tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth . Where is the seat of authority in the hive ? Who rules ? Not the slow , stupid drone ; not the worker , drudging day and night ; nor , if you watch , can you see that it is the queen , her position and all tradition to the contrary . Royal she is and royally attended , feted and flat ? tered , counseled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal favor . She is the weakest , slowest-witted , least assertive member of them all . She is life , not the will to live , deriving that power from the colony . She is only a well of water for a thirsty people , an oasis in a barren desert . She does not give ; they take . She is neither largess nor reward nor punishment . The keys are not in her hand . She is obedience , and never authority ? the central object of command , the one on whom the vested power of the government is most bent ; passive mother , slave of all , incapable of giving command and / utterly incapable except when com ? manded . Queen ? I have never seen a bee ? keeper who did not instinctively render her the homage due a queen . For regal is her person , singular her position , her significance to the colony supreme . She is the veriest symbol , however , instru ? ment rather than person , a weaver 's shuttle whose being seems but a turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing if unmated . Until she meets the drone she is unattended and ignored , without place or destiny , a menace and a wanderer in the hive . Yet is she everything but crowned , having already stung to death her aspiring sis ? ters . For while the colony needs but one queen fearful of the fates that only more than enough will satisfy ? the bees provide several candidates , heirs ap ? parent to the throne . These the victor has destroyed . The virgin queen first to emerge from her cell instantly hastens to claim her birthright , though by a primogeniture , it may be , of only a few seconds . Led by the conniving people ( she may be held back if there is reason ) , lashed by in ? stinctive fear and fury , she makes for the chambers of her royal sisters , rips open their walls and falls with cruel savagery upon the coming contenders . Some ? times the hapless sister is still asleep , a pallid sheeted thing with nerveless limbs and straightened wings , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; more often she is awake , and free , or all but free , and hears within her walls the tumult and the shouting of the streets , and shouts defiance back , a shrill wild piping , as her assassin sister closes with her for the throne . The fight is short : a single thrust of the scimitar sting ; a curling , quivering body snatched by the crowd and hus ? tled out of the way ; and a rush of the victor for the next virgin who has designs upon the marriage flight , the great fate , the throne ! As the thrust of her sting must be mortal , and because the recurv ? ing barbs might be fatal to conqueror and conquered alike , the hand of Nature , not unerring , though in the end unfail ? ing , guides the dagger with terrible cun ? ning into one of the spiracles , the breath ? ing holes , on the sides of the rival 's body , from which vital spot it can be instantly and safely withdrawn . Soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been borne outside the city gates to the potter 's field ( there are no tombs within this city ) ; the last queen cell has been rifled of its shrouded sleeper ; the colony is busy and contented ; and the young princess , left quite to her ? self , has now a week of preparation for the supreme passage of her life . To one end was she created . Into one unparalleled moment will life 's great ad ? venture be crowded ; her fate and that of her race be sealed . Through this im ? pending flight will the way and the truth of all flesh be revealed . its virginal beauty , the dreadful cost of its concep ? tion and birth . The bride-elect is under no compulsion for these days to the laws of the hive . She is obeying an inner urge , a law older than any statute of tribe or state . A chosen vessel , set apart , exempted , dedicated , she wan ? ders quietly about the combs , every bee aware of her movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nay . For she is none of theirs , not yet , but only hope of theirs , their exceeding great and pre ? cious promise . She belongs to her lover , Life . And round about her gathers an invisible eompany . Unborn multitudes panoply and possess her . Destiny , like a presence , attends her . She is Life . After Life is Law . I have sometimes had the royal virgin VOL CXLIX. ? No. 800 . ? ISarise from her couch and rest upon my hand . Once she took her wedding flight from of my finger , as if I had given the bride away ! And those sweet days be ? tween her waking and her wedding I have often watched her as I have a maid betrothed , and seen her stray about the waxen rooms , unwitting of their shape , nor seeing they were childless , nor hear ? ing in her quiet mind , unless it were as far-off singing , the wailing over all the empty , cradled combs . Like a girl be ? side her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mate , the lover cruising for her high in the azure lift ? but of her fate , that she is the chosen , the elect , the bride of Life ! The hive is full of drones , but they pass her by . This is not the appointed time and place . She knows not when nor where ; but could a bride fail ? She knows that in her book of days the name of her mate is written , that the altar is appointed among the clouds , and that even the wedding march the winds shall blow has been selected ? when they , the elect , shall meet . The vast dome of the sky shall be their bridal chamber . They two shall meet ; but only one of them shall return ? only the bride ? wife , widow , and immaculate mother , as ever immaculate the bride of Life must be . An oak tree laden with acorns , a queen heavy with eggs , a mother carry ? ing child are all immaculate , their names written in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? if places be appointed for the planets and the stars . The wings of the wind , or the wings of the bee , or the wings of love ? it is all one , the single way of Life , the same mysterious , the same immaculate , the same mortal and immortal thing ! All flesh is grass . The grass withereth , the flower fadeth whether the wrath of God or the love of God blow upon it . But under the mortal breath of love the withering stem and fading flower die into seed ? thirty , sixty and an hundred ? fold . It is God that giveth the increase . In the queen bee it is ten thousand times ten thousandfold ! Within a few weeks after her mating every living member of the commonwealth shall have been born of her who is now fulfilling the short days of her maidenhood . For she is to be parthenogenic . The seed in her virgin body is male seed which , if left unfertilized , will spring into drone life ? and only drone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her re ? maining virginal , the other part made maternal , fertile , producing worker eggs . In truth she is not fertilized in the ordi ? nary sense at all , but receives into the spermatheca in her body the vital ele ? ment from the drone and there preserves it . There are from two to twenty mil ? lion of these sperm cells , each sperm the sufficient power to transform a neutral drone egg into a fertile worker egg , changing it in sex and shape and function . But who or what determines whether worker or drone egg shall be laid ? Every egg in the body of the queen , detached from the ovarian cluster , starts doxyn the oviduct unfertilized , and if the queen is laying it in a roomy drone cell we say it passes on by the spermatheca without contact with sperm and remains a drone to the end . If the queen 's abdomen is inserted deep into a narrow worker cell , however , the egg iii passing the sperma ? theca causes a slight pressure , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an arrow to its mark , penetrates an orifice at the big end of the egg ? and that egg is changed . Did the queen will it so ? Or did she deposit the egg where her attendants di ? rected ? Did the workers will it directly or indirectly when they drew out the comb , building this cell worker and the next cell drone ? Or was it contrived for them , willed by the accumulated , col ? lective wisdom of the race , handed down to them in the marvelous mechanics of the comb ? It seems automatic with the queen and quite beyond her will . Yet the queen bee of the race Apis dorsua , the big jungle bee of India , lays both drone and worker eggs in the same cell , as if she had absolute control . So my own queens , when drones are needed anddrone cells are lacking , will lay the in ? fertile eggs in worker cells : which would seem to give to her , not to the mechanics of the cell , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tion to conceive of such physical control do we balk at allowing this power and purpose to the queen . She is laying up ? ward of a thousand eggs a day , and can she possibly determine that this one shall he fertile and the next one drone ? Within the plated walls of her body to exact such obedience of duct and muscle , within the tiny brain to will thus unfal ? teringly , unfailingly , with the faithful swing of a pendulum , is beyond our little minds to grasp . Yet some measure of a. power like this she surely has ; and full measure , it may be , though acting , for the most part , automatically , so regu ? larly repeated is the operation , especially over the worker-comb . We are all too wise to understand these things . We thrust the problem of Life into the profound depths of some cell , round or six-sided , and lo ; the cell is sealed ! And while we watch the cap is broken , the stone is rolled away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp and ghostly pale , from far beyond the grave comes forth a worker or a drone ? the old recurring miracle and mystery , not the answer we had craved . But we would not believe what we crave , we of little faith . All flesh is grass . Yet at . moments how much more is it motion and music and color and joy ! High in the blue of the summer sky the drone and the virgin meet , two darting bodies , like two elec ? trons colliding , for a single whirling in ? stant of being ; when with a javelin , as from some jealous hand , the pair are smitten , severed , the drone a dying em ? ber pitching earthward like some falling star , his vital parts torn from him , and trailing like a frayed banner from the body of the queen , who , treading with heavy wing her widowed way , descends into the shadowed chambers of the hive , her narrow place and part for ? ever . Nor is she queen ! Nor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mind and will surrendered as , gently pushed from cradle to cradle over the endless comb , she is led by force , fed by force , and forced within the cycle of a single day to lay her weight in eggs twice over , dividing her body daily into myriad embryon selves . Such is her portion . Authority is not with her . Clay in the Potter 's hands ? marvelous clay ! ? she is forever broken at the wheel , forever whole , one and the multitude , never to leave the gloom of the brood chamber except when the colony swarms . She is not monarch but mother , not person but principle , the procreative principle , fecundity social ? ized and functioning in a political sys ? tem of such exclusive specialization and such absolute solidarity as to seem more like a factory than a social organism . For this end is the virgin born , and here in the hive for her allotted days she dreams ? no rival left , no hazard more except the far , fierce wedding flight be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of drones . Dangers throng the open sky . But the groom is waiting there in the arching blue . She must spread her bridal wings , she must fly ? up to the gate of heaven and meet her lover , Life . But while she lingers , and all Nature waits upon the issue , she brings into the loveless gloom and overspeeded industry of the hive a hit of lovely leisure , a touch of gentleness and quiet winsome grace . Not innocent of her destiny , yet know ? ing not her hour nor all her dedication means , she goes idly about the crowded combs , sipping with sweet abandon the new nectar in the vats , finding a path ? way cleared for her as she moves and , quite alone , comes out into the sunshine on the portico before the city 's busy gates . Young , slender , serene she trips into the glowing light . " Maids are May while they are maids , " must have been said originally of the young queen . After that the sky changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates , all excitement at the soft air , the radiant light , the reach and the range of thehigh-piled clouds and the blue beyond , yet all restraint . She spreads her wings , dances this way and that , fills her body with the buoyant air , her heart so light that she has no need of wingsTrip no further , pretty sweeting , Journeys end in lovers ' meeting . But what are lovers for ? and wings ? She hardly knows . Such wondrous wings ! She spreads them wide ? wide ? wide till a little breeze catches the slant ? ing sails , heels her , luffs her , lifts her , and tries to carry her off . Frightful ! She darts for safety inside the sheltered hive , then quickly reappears , for the wind is in her wings , and wings are in her very soul . Such wondrous silken wings ! She shakes them , spreads them , runs fear ? fully into the tiny gale , rises , floats , hangs for a moment like a jeweled ship upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark her moorings , she swings out upon the argent sea and , swifter than Argo for the Golden Fleece , darts into the blue ? for Life . But this is only a trial trip . She is back at once . Not yet is she off ; for she must mark well the harbor , and learn well the course of the voyage . She shall come heavily laden back to port . The drones boom heedlessly in and out while she , with many hovering flights , graves on her memory the map about the hive ; notes street and gate , the bunch of milfoil , the garden 's slope , the wall of woods beyond : charting the very skies that site may safe return . For she comes freighted with the fate of the world . Part of this responsibility the drone also shares , but is utterly unburdened with the weight of it . Created to secure the fulfillment of the queen 's life , the drone and all his abundant kind have no other thing to do . Only one drone may do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useless as the dead , play on until , the swifter , happier fate of their brother denied them , their little day is done . It is the worker who knows and seems to bear the burden of the hive . Like drone and queen , she too is single , separate , a factor , not a person , She is even de ? formed for duty , her instincts and pas ? sions perverted to industry , gone into hoarding brain and carrying thigh . She works . The drone idles , a gourmand and a cumberer of the combs ; or takes his station in the upper air at noon on amour bent ? big , burly , powerful in flight , his only quest the virgin queen . The queen brings forth ? lays , lays , all the sub ? stance of mind and body fed to abdo ? men and ovaries , tier very will , it may be , hut the reflex of the pains of travail . Like drone and worker , the queen is par ? tial , a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive . But to-day she is yet a virgin and free ! Oh , fondest dream ! Was ever virgin free , or worker , or idle drone ? The face of the fields is fair this Sep ? tember noon . The honey flow is at or nearing flood , pouring into the bee-garden on a rising tide of song . The lips of Life are sweet with love . But Death 's red lips are sweeter . And every drone has soared aloft to taste their mortal kiss . And while they scour the skyey coasts , the virgin queen with many bridesmaids appears again before the gates . See her , slender , shapely , far beyond her neuter sisters . Her wedding garments wrought of cloth of gold ; her sandals winged with iridescent light ; her bridal veil spun of a film of floating azure de ? scending upon her from the dome of blue and gold . Is it the singing of the spheres we hear ? Or only flower bells , wedding bells , along the hillsides , on the meadows , and faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it the sound of many wings , eager wings of bridesmaids , which they would lend the bride , wings that would fly in her stead knew they the fields where love is found . They know where nectar , pollen and propolis are found . They know only to store and seal the combs , not how to fly to love . They are forever chained to toil . The queen 's wings are Love 's wings . And yet they flutter feebly on the por ? tico . The Chosen One delays as if afraid . Feeble wings and heavy heart ill fit a bride ! She fears to go . And well she may ? or any bride ! If she remem ? bers all the wisdom of her mothers , to do in turn like them ; may she not also re ? member what they remember and trem ? ble , much afraid ? She has not willed these tragic nuptials in the sky . She has not fixed the day , nor named her mate . She is the bride and needs must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor escape the net of Love ? and would not if she could , though she may tremble at both Love and Life , and at that swift , for-shortened span when , bride and wife and widow for a radiant moment high in heaven , she drops on weighted wings down to perpetual gloom , perpetual pain , perpetual birth within the hive . What drives her on ? Who wills her to life , the worker to passionless ster ? ility and toil , and the riotous drone to idle high-noon revelry and death at dusk ? Here is a power , neither queen , nor worker , nor drone ? nor all of them , nor bee ; a power purposeful , logical , cal ? culating , the inventor and perfector of this social insect scheme . Is it more than power ? a presence ? Is he intelli ? gent ? Does he love Life ?
