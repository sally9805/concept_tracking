txt The Lash for Criminals . It is Interesting and illuminating to read the many suggestions in the daily papers in reference to the steadily Increasing crimes . mostly Violent , often carried so far as to cause the death as well as robbery of the victim . These suggestions so far run chiefly to creation of new laws or speeding up present statutes , neither of which makes the punishment Tit the crime . When this is done these crimes will cease ; it has been done before , was successful , and is as true and sure as ever It was . The only remedy for violent crimes is violent and speedy punishment . Give Magistrates the power to dispense summary punishment by means of the cat o ' nine tails ; the more wanton and ferocious the crime , the more lashes for the criminal ; this also must apply to all caught " toting a gat , " " billy " or like murderous weapons , and any one caught with a " kit of tools " should be alike rewarded . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , let them . They wo n't stop violent crime or help the victim . There is no doubt in my mind that even If a hint that such punishment would be advocated through the press , or by any body of citizens , such crimes would materially lessen . The only remedy is the cat ; the sooner you get its tail wagging the better . PERCY B. FIRTH . New York , Aug. 30. 1925 ,
