It is the duty of Ulysses Simpson Grant III ( grandson ) to walk observantly through the greenery of forest and pasture out of which the great parks of Washington , D. C. , are carved . Last week he , director of public parks , started a vigorous campaign against " spooning , necking and petting , noticeably prevalent in darkened automobiles at night in the parks . " He planned to have park-users sign a pledge , reading : " I will refrain from any action , posture or public display of amorousness that might be offensive to others or could set a bad example to children . " <P> Also the pledge includes precautions against fires , grass-littering , flower-picking.
