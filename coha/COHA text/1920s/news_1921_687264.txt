After binding their victims and : , hutting them in a closet , the robbers put their pistols into their pockets and escaped from the building by a fire escape . They emerged in Fifty-first Street and disappeared westward in a black taxicab that apparently had been waiting for them . The several thousand persons watching the show had no idea that something was going on directly over theid heads which was inti:211 more exciting and real than the dramatic scenes they saw flickering before them on the screen . After the show , the spectators filed out on Broadway without having heard the noise of the robbery and escape , or without having been disturbed by the investigation of the police or the general commotion among the theatre attaches .

Although the theatre management believes that none of the bandits was an employe or a former employe , it was conceded that somebody who had an intimate knowledge of the theatre and the routine of its employes must have played a guiding if invisible part in the transaction . The bandits went into the theatre building apparently with exact inormation as to the time and place a large amount of money would be there  - -  on the only night in the week when the day 's receipts are kept overnight in the building instead of being deposited in the bank . The employes of the theatre who were present in the auditor 's office when the bandits entered were J. L. Falconer , the auditor ; John Matthews , house manager ; Miss Pearl Courtrlght , cashier , and Thomas Maher , watchman and guard .

When he entered the room on the second trip , Falconer opened the safe door and was about to transfer the money from a small hag , in which he had brought it from the box office , to a tin tray , which was to have been put in the safe . The two other men and Miss Courtright were chatting and occupying themselves in various ways preparatory to going home at the end of the last show . None of the four in the room heard the door open . Before they were aware of the entry three men were standing in a HUI. ? areaway just inside the outer door , and one of them , resting his hand on the ledge of a little window above an information desk behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing a pistol at falconer . The two others pushea into the room , each with a pistol in his right hand . " Stick your hands , up and be quick : " the leader ordered . The three intruders had the drop on the men in the room , only one of whom , the watchman , carried a weapon . " Hurry up and back up against the Wall , " the bandit chief went on . " We 'll shoot if there is any noise . " Bands Bound With Wire . The robbers lined up the three men and the woman near a window overlooking the roof over the grand lobby of the theatre . Forcing them to turn their faces to the wail , the robbers made the three men put their hands behind their backs . Then they bound the hands of each of the men with wire which they had carried with them .

It was then an easy matter for the robbers to pick up the money , which was partly in the collection bag and partly in the tin tray . They stuffed it all into the bag  --  ** took the bag with them . But-in their hurry to get away they neglected to look around the room carefully .

Usher Sees Robbers Escaping . They did all this and succeeded in escaping without detection . Only one slight incident threatened to lead to their capture . After they had shut their victim in the closet and had taker the money , but before they had left the room , rank Limo , a youthful usher , came up from the theatre and entered the auditor 's room . eal.ing for " Mr. Matthews . " There was no answer from Mr. Matthews . Instead , what met the I terrified eyes of the youth was the sight of three rough-looking men , stuffing pistols in their pockets anti trying to beat each other climbing out of the window . The robbers paid no attention to the boy . He turned back through the door and ran to the street , yelling at the top of his voice .

Several persons said they saw the black taxicab speed westward on Fifty-first Street toward Eighth Avenue . As far ' ita could be learned . no one supplied the police with the license- number of the automobile . Gloves Prevent Fingerprints . The police of the West Forty-seventh Street Station were notified , and Detectives Ferguson and Garrity were assigned to the investigation . According to the pollee , the robbery bore the earmarks of highly skilled professional robbers , with the assistance of an informer , who told them the arrangement of the office , the means of escape and the time when such It large sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the auditor 's office were found two gloves ; both cheap and worn , but of different sizes and makes .

The robbers were said to be all young men of the American type , rather cheaply dressed . One was about 5 feet 10 Inches tall ; another 5 Lint II.aryl thn ? hird font Mr. Falconer told the police and reporters that Sunday night was the only night in the week when a large sum of money was kept in the building .

Edward Bowes , managing director of the Capitol Theatre , told reporters he left the theatre about 10:13 o'clock , only about five minutes before the robbery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr , Bowe , " and did not know anything about the robbery until it was all over . I wish I had been there . I carry a loaded automatic pistol in my pocket and I would not have been afraid to have used it . " Mr. Bowes said the watchman usually stood on guard In the corridor in front of the auditor 's office while the money was being counted . Last night he had waited in the office to guard the money already there until the others arrived with the last collection and was about to take his customary post when the robbers entered . According to Mr : ? Bowes , the robbers could have reached the Auditor 's ? Illy ? ey two ways . One was to go in the Broadway entrance of the building just south of the entrance to the theatre and take the elevator or walk up ' to the third floor . Another way was to have entered the theatre itself , gone to the balcony floor and walked through a small door to a long corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was situated . An usher is posted at the balcony door between the theatre and the office building , and a teleWlone operator is in the first corridor . . Loth the usher and telephone operator said they had seen no one use this private entrance just before the robbery . The elevator . operator said also ithat no one had gone up the elevator from the Broadway entrance . The Theory of the Pollee . The best theory as to how the robbers gained entrance , according to the police , is that they went in the Broadway door to the theatre building one by one , while the elevator was upstairs . They climbed up the stairway back of the elevator , reached the third floor corridor , and hid themselves there until the auditor and the money arrived .
