Last week , 25 U. S. missionaries wrote a letter to the U. S. Legation at Peking , in which they declared that they were in China only as " messengers of the Gospel of Brotherhood and Peace " and went on to express the desire that " no form of military pressure , especially no military force , " should be used to protect them or their property . " We take this stand , " the missionaries continued , " believing that the way to establish righteousness and peace is through bringing the spirit of personal good-will to bear on all persons under all circumstances , even though suffering wrong without retaliation . " <P> The U. S. Legation at Peking dissented from the view of the missionaries . The opinion was expressed that U. S. interest and the safety of U. S. citizens would be permanently jeopardized if the U. S. were to entertain the absurd notion that there was no necessity to protect citizens in China .                  @ @ @
