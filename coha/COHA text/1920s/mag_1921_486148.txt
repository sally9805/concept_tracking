T was with pride and complete satisfaction that Secre-1 tary Hughes announced to the waiting and eager Washington correspondents the compromise on his restriction program which the Japanese have so skilfully and determinedly forced . There was no doubt that to him and his associates it appears the greatest step since the armistice and one of the greatest ever taken toward peace and goodwill among the nations . Yet among the waiting press-writers it created no such enthusiasm . The English correspondents notably were aghast that their country was to be compelled to expend about $125,000,000 to build two new ships solely in order that Japan 's pride in her Mutzu might be gratified , and they could not help recalling that spokesmen for the Americans had repeatedly assured them since this Conference began that the way to stop building is to stop and the way to end a race fairly is to halt in your tracks . But whether it is because of Shantung , or Manchuria , or the Four-Power Treaty , or merely because of the superior skill and determination of the Japanese delegates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our delegates who were at first determined that there should be no yielding of an inch , much less of a battleship . We were not going to fall into bargaining after the manner of Versailles ! But now Japan has obtained her battleship , so that she has two " post-Jutland " dreadnoughts to match our three while for the moment England has none . Next Japan has won her fight for the ending of the dangerous rivalry in Pacific fortifications and we are to be spared the folly and the cost of further fortifying the Philippines and of making a great naval base at Guam . If Admiral Kato- is not thrice decorated for this , then the Regent does not know how to appreciate service to one 's country . But far more than that is the discovery that the loosely drawn Four-Power Treaty may easily be interpreted to include the main Japanese islands . True , this is vehemently denied by spokesmen for our Government . It is not , they say , their understanding of the meaning of the words of the treaty . Alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of statesmen to interpret them as they wish to and not necessarily as anyone may think the framers intended the documents to read . As for the press observers here , they are openly saying that the guaranty of aid which we refuse to give to France as protection against Germany only we are now giving to Japan as against all the world . They are not affected by the official declaration that the proposed treaty with France binds us Four-Power to use force to pro- tect her against Germany while the our-Power Treaty is not specific as to what methods the four Powers shall use when they get together to decide what to do in the event of an attack , or the threat of an attack , by another Power . Even granting the position of our Government that this comparison is " beside the mark , " there can be no question that , until the Four-Power Treaty is amended so as specifically not to bind the United States to the necessity of hostile measures , ' Japan is guaranteed American aid by the Four-Power Treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstructed and armed China . Japan retains at worst most of the advantages of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance plus the support of France and the United States . Perhaps another-reason why there was no enthusiasm for the compromise in favor of Japan was the announcement that even this naval ratio agreement depends upon fixing a proper proportion for the naval strength of France and Italy . The press speedily found out and printed the amazing fact that France is actually asking for a battleship strength of 350,000 tons which would give her a " post-Jutland " super-dreadnought fleet of no less than ten modern ships to England 's two . The English in Washington regard it as a direct slap at their country , a grave challenge and a most serious menace to their peace . It is bad enough , they say , that France should insist on her huge standing army ; it is much worse that she should ask for a super-battleship squadron five times the size of Great Britain 's . The fact that the demand is probably merely a basis for bargaining leaves it no less another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not offset the additional heat it brings to the already existing antagoniSm between the two great allies  --  proof of whiCh is the fact that-the official spokesman for England has let it be known that the English will walk out of the Conference rather than submit , and the news which leaked out that at the first session of the committee to discuss the French ratio Mr. Balfour made use of language so forceful and vigorous as to amaze . Mr. Balfour has been very long on compliments and flattery for the French orators ever since he got to Washington . It is plain now that a new style of speech has arrived . As for the United States , if Mr. Hughes and his colleagues consent to any such plan they will have to admit that it whittles down their great saving in battleship tonnage by at least 175,000 tons . If they permit any such proposal to go through in addition to the large submarine tonnage asked by the French , they will thoroughly misrepresent the wishes and desires of the American people . The citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her debts or the interest thereon if she is going to waste $600,000,000 on new capital ships  --  each new super-dreadnought costs in England today $56,000,000 . With what face can France accept from England all the money that is so generously being poured into the " adopted " towns and cities in the devastated districts for reconstruction purposes if she can afford such funds for naval construction ? She does not need to beg or to receive alms if she has such stupendous sums to waste on ships that will certainly be obsolete within a few years if the bombing plane and the submarine are developed any further . Adoption of the French naval program , so far from making for the peace of the world , would insure the same kind of naval hostilities between France and England that existed before the war between Germany and England . One has only to recall how , not long before the war , Lord Fisher , then First Lord of the Admiralty , asked the British Government 's permission to sink the German fleet at anchor in Kiel harbor without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would be the attitude of British navalists toward any attempt to build up a great French fleet . It is no wonder that the cable reports that the news of the French demands for the best fleet in the world by 1935 " seemed so sensational that it was not credited when it first arrived in London . " Certainly the British would have reason to consider that the new French fleet was aimed at them alone . For whom else could it be intended ? The Italians , too , were outraged by the proposal . Her delegates are willing to go far toward real disarmament . What , they ask , does this French move mean ? The making of a - French lake out of the Mediterranean ? That the French demand will enormously increase the hostility to the Four-Power Treaty in Congress goes with- out saying , and so will Admiral Kato 's diplomatic successes . That honest men can so differ as to what the " clear and plain language " of the covenant means shows the absolute necessity of subjecting it to microscopic examination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington much longer the American people will turn away from the whole business with the same sickening disappointment with which they read of the final disaster at Paris . They will be more than ever " fed up " with foreign diplomats and their ways and will be more than ever likely to insist upon our letting Europe go hang while we go our own sweet way , which is wise enough so far as political entanglements are concerned , but may have disastrous results when the time comes for the UniteciStates to cooperate economically abroad  --  as some day soon she must if Europe is to be saved from complete economic collapse . Already Senators like Mr. Reed and Mr. Borah and Mr. La Follette who have come out against the treaty are feeling the turn of public opinion toward them . The Conference faces the acid test . It is bad enough that its general atmosphere has become more and more like Versailles in the prevalence of fear , suspicion , jealousy , and bargaining . What is worse is that the public is beginning to question whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose and with a real desire genuinely to decrease armaments . If the Conference breaks up , or if the French succeed in getting even five of the ten ships they ask , the disillusionment the world over will be of serious import , for it will make men in multitudes realize that there is no hope for the world as long as its present rulers continue to dominate and to misrepresent the desires of their people . Mr. Henry W. Nevinson is right in saying that even the Japanese compromise , quite aside from the French demands , " proves that the delegates , especially the Japanese , do not really contemplate peace , but work for reduced and more highly efficient instruments of war . " Meanwhile anxiety increases as to what this compromising Conference will do , or permit to be done , to China . Fortunately , at this writing the negotiations between China and Japan are progressing better than seemed possible two weeks ago . At least it now appears as if the Chinese might get the whole of Shantung back upon satisfactory terms . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things so often makes against their interest . The opportunity which they lost at the beginning to achieve a moral leadership of the Conference second only to that of the Americans has already been pointed out in these columns . If they came with their - minds made up to yield on Shantung it is a great pity from their own point of view that they did not announce it with a splendid gesture and the appearance of free and generous renunciation , and thus win the thorough good-will of everybody in Washington , especially the Chinese . It is obvious that Mr. K. K. Kawakami is correct when he says " Japan has lost a golden opportunity to assume leadership in the adjustment of Far Eastern affairs . However sympathetic to her we may be , we can not but feel that Japanese statesmanship is sadly deficient in vision and foresightedness . " It is his belief that Japan should have stated her program in unequivocal terms at the outset of the Conference . Instead , we have even seen the Japanese delegates asking for time to study the twenty-one Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were something new about which they had to be informed ! As it is , the fate of the Pacific Joint Conference hangs in a peculiar degree upon the outcome of the struggle between the Japanese and the Chinese ; Manchuria may be the deciding point . A recognition of this fact is keeping many of the Senators from reaching a final decision as to their attitude toward the Four-Power Treaty . They want to know how the Conference is going to treat China because they believe that the Pacific islands treaty must be read in the light of what the Powers decide shall be done for the Chinese Republic . If that decision is imperialistic , if the agreement to be arrived at legalizes and sanctifies the Japanese position in China and notably in Manchuria , the belief will be that the spirit behind the Four-Power Treaty is much more imperialistic than now appears . At any rate , each day 's delay in ratifying the treaty will make clearer than ever that the United States does not wish to guarantee Japan in any situation in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Richmond News Leader concludes an editorial on the Conference by the frank question : " Are we fooling ourselves about a limitation of armaments ? Are the diplomats merely laying aside outworn weapons for new ones ? Is the whole Conference a ghastly joke ? God forbid ! " The Conference can not be merely a ghastly joke because of the enormous educational value it has had , because of the revelation of themselves and their methods which the diplomats have given before the onlooking world . But one of the saddest and most discouraging things about it all remains that with the English rightly demanding the total abolition of the submarine our American delegates are not only not helping but are throwing their influence against the proposal . It is easy to sneer and to say that England has everything to gain and nothing to lose by the outlawing of the submarine . That may be true if the world will persist in the madness of war , but the whole of a rational world has nothing to lose and everything to gain , not only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poisonous gases which menace our whole civilization . American public opinion is overwhelmingly behind the proposal to do away with these foul instruments of warfare . The self-satisfied and happy Mr. Hughes can not seem to find a moment to listen to the rising tide of public demand that the United States shall lead in abolishing them . It looks as if the Conference would be nothing more than the merest beginning of disarmament . Again the question arises : Is revolution the only hope ? Washington , Dec. 17 OSWALD GARRISON VILLARD Since this article was written has come the welcome news that Premier Briand has assured Ambassador Harvey in London that France will accept Mr. Hughes 's suggested ratio of 1.70 , as against 5 for the United States and Great Britain , 3 for Japan and 1.68 for Italy . But the dispatches are quite - clear that this amiable retraction of the French demand is not born of love of peace . France apparently expects something from England  --  some advantage in negotiations on German reparations , or more probably consent to her demand for more submarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTON SINCLAIR could make his " Jungle " so vivid a picture of the stockyards as to move the American public to protect itself , but all the agitation which resulted in a pure-food law did little enough for stockyard workers . For them the civilizer was the labor union . With the organization of the men things began to change for the better . From December 24 , 1917 , until September 15 , 1921 , all controversies in the packing industry were settled under an arbitration agreement which the " Big Five " packers and the union made with the United States Government , Judge Samuel Alschuler being the impartial arbitrator . Under this arrangement , stockyard employees gained something like a living wage and new self-respect  --  and all this without strikes or violence of any kind . Then the packers , as part of an open-shop campaign , denounced the arbitration agreement and established employees ' representation on the basis of company rather than national unions . A letter from Swift and Company to The Nation declares : We also believe that we can do our employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with a group of labor officials who are only too prone to stir up dissatisfaction and ill-feeling and who do not give fair expression to our workers . The new system was heralded as idyllic ; hard-working press agents for the packers announced that the workers ' representatives actually agreed to a wage cut which the companies demanded ! Then came the crash . The labor union called a strike . Ninety per cent of the stockyard workers in America walked out and they walked out in so angry a mood that in Chicago , at least , the strike has been attended by serious riots . " What has become of the company union as a panacea ? The question gains force when one considers another strike  --  that of the employees of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company . Here also existed a scheme of employee representation inaugurated by John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Here also the employees were supposed to have accepted a wage cut , yet when that wage cut was put into effect the national labor union called a strike which was promptly effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , partly , perhaps , because the company has nothing to gain in these hard times by undertaking the expense of importing strike-breakers and making a vigorous fight against the union . But the strike though peaceful is none the less proof of the breakdown of the Rockefeller plan at a decisive point . We do not record these dramatic evidences of the failure of company unions to preserve industrial peace because we are opposed to " employee representation . " When honestly carried out any small beginning at self-government in industry is to be applauded , but in great industries , such as coal mines or meat packing , it is absurd to think that employee representation which ignores organized national labor unions can be satisfactory to the workers . The familiar argument of employers that they want to deal only with their own men is not at all convincing . It could be paralleled if the men should retort : " We want , then , to deal only with our own employers without the intervention of hired lawyers , bankers , and ' business associates . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is even more preposterous to argue that the employees who hold their jobs at the mercy of the bosses can argueeffectively with those bosses without any outside aid from the ranks of their fellow-workers . In England and Germany plans for industrial democracy presuppose the existence both of employees ' associations and of national unions . There is nothing in the air of America to make any other plan successful here . No scheme of employee representation , whether honestly intended or designed merely to frustrate labor unions , can be put on a sure basis which does not frankly take into account the rightful existence and power of national unions . Company unions which ignore national organizations invite trouble . Nor are company unions the only device of the employing class whose futility has been emphasized by recent strikes . There is the Kansas Industrial Court . Only the other day the newspapers reported Governor Allen as telling a Brooklyn audience that his pet court had served the public interest by preventing picketing in the strike in Kansas stockyards . At the time he spoke the Wolfe Packing Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in favor of the workers while in Kansas City and Wichita thousands of workers not only were out on strike but were peacefully picketing the yards . More dramatic evidence of the failure of his plan was to follow when dispatches told of armies of women , leaderless but determined , who waged war with pepper and jam to prevent coal miners from returning to work . The Governor ended his missionary journey by calling out troops to manage women ! This is a continuance of the trouble which has followed the conviction of Alexander Howat for defying the industrial court . The strike he called and for which he was convicted involved 200 men . After he was sentenced 12,000 men walked out . Some of the men returned not on the court 's order , but by direction of John L. Lewis , international president of the United Mine Workers . Since then a kind of civil war has smoldered . A Kansas correspondent , Mr. W. G. Clugston , to whom we are indebted for much information on this subject , writes us that before the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and one miner shot . And still the court did nothing . Its failure became notorious throughout the State . Even the little cases of a sort it once dealt with were no longer referred to it . To recover popularity , at least with the employers , the court , without a request from any one , revoked its previous order requiring flour mills to submit to it for approval plans for shutting down or laying off men . This added to the bitterness of labor feeling but won little respect from the employers or public . No wonder President Harding took pains to allay the fears of labor leaders that his own recommendation for industrial tribunals meant a Federal equivalent of the Kansas Court . Governor Allen 's plan originally made a specious appeal to many thoughtful citizens . But the proof of the pudding is in the eating . As a practical proposition the scheme-is simply unworkable , and the very existence of a court nominally empowered to determine the conditions under which wage workers must invest their lives acts as an irritant to those who long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face reality ; the workers can not be treated as chattels . - Neither can they long be fooled by panaceas which give them a mere illusion of freedom and justice . The basis for industrial peace is an honest recognition of the right of organized workers to an increasing measure of control over industry . HE Very Young Critic was vexed . " With all possible I. respect , " he said , " I do n't see that all your talk about Plato and the consensus of mankind and the great moral tradition gets you anywhere . You would n't be reading Plato himself if he had n't been such a charming writer . And in his most charming thing ' The Banquet ' there are both incidents and doctrines that , well  --  they do n't exactly fit into your scheme . " The Graybeard smiled . " I was aware that you had probably read nothing of Plato except ' The Banquet ' and that probably again in the version and interpretation of Shelley . The fact remains that man is distinguished from the brutes by having built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within this sensible world . That is the City of God in which Sophocles and Plato , Dante and Shakespeare are the rulers . There is beauty enough in that city . But that beauty is the expression of the highest aspirations of the race . To be disloyal to those aspirations is to tear down the walls of the city which noble spirits in many centuries have built against the winds of paganism and license and degradation and despair . " The Very Young Critic who limped a little when he walked had a rather flippant expression . " I notice that your walls did n't keep out the war . That was some example of degradation and despair ! " " To those who did n't grasp its purpose and meaning ! " The Graybeard grew a little red in the face . " Of course , if I 'm talking to a pacifist or a pro-German . . . " " Not at all , " said the Very Young Critic , " though I confess your City seemed a little queer with Goethe out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences . The whole thing seems pretty rotten . And one ca n't help noticing that the moral old gentlemen got us into the great mess and ca n't get us out . That 's one big reason why I repudiate , so far as art goes , the expression of moral values . Such expression is futile . Beauty is the absolute good , a beauty that is , so far as possible , remote from the muddle of practical things . It 's their concern with that muddle which ruined Shaw and Wells . An exquisite , abstract pattern is the same yesterday , today , and forever . " The Graybeard could contain himself no longer . " Young man , " he said , " that 's twaddle . We heard that twaddle in the nineties . Where are those twaddlers now ? How did Oscar Wilde end ? " The Critic of Forty had been listening patiently . " I do n't like to see you two quarreling , " he said at last , " because there 's no fundamental difference between you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very Young Critic chirped . The Graybeard smiled his disdain . " Why , no , " said the Critic of Forty . " You 're like two people in a ship . The ship is on the rocks ; her bottom 's fouled ; her sails are rags and her masts in splinters . Most of the passengers are dead , the rest and the crew are rotten with scurvy . You two happened to be in the first cabin and happened to have private supplies . So you talk . One of you , " he turned to the Graybeard , " says : ' This is the noble ship on which my fathers sailed . Their charts are as near an approach to absolute truth as man can reach . Let no one rock the boat . So long as we stick to this ship and these charts we are , at least , upholding the dignity that befits man , the traditions of our race and nation , and defeatingthe savagery of human nature . ' And you , " he grinned in the direction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things look bad but no doubt you 're right . Let 's fiddle a tune ! ' " The Graybeard looked severe . " Parables and analogies are notoriously misleading . A skipper 's charts may not be absolutely accurate . He 'll do no better by throwing them overboard . " " It 's not a question , " the Critic of Forty said , " of tolerably inaccurate charts , but of such as are necessarily and demonstrably misleading . But I shall drop my analogy . To talk about a beautiful abstract pattern except in the arts of decoration is meaningless . Literature , at all events , since it deals with the actions and passions of men , must express both the values which men hold and live by and the author 's attitude to those values which is , in turn , the necessary expression of his own . Hence literature can no more avoid moral and philosophical and even political and economic issues than a man can jump out of his skin . " The Graybeard looked benign . " Precisely , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you 're forgetting how I started . I agree with you that literature is practical and moral and I do not agree with our young friend , who does n't really agree with himself , that it can be abstracted from morals and practice . But you mean one set of morals and one kind of practice . You are thinking of a set of morals long formulated and a kind of practice long agreed upon . And you want literature to illustrate these . You want , if you 'll forgive my returning to my feeble illustration , to keep on poring over the old charts while the ship goes utterly to pieces and the rest of the passengers and the crew die in agony . That 's not what I want . I want literature within its own field to cooperate with both the critical and creative movement by which the human intelligence must reconstruct the moral and practical basis of life , if life is to persist at all . We have followed the old charts . We have built up institutions and enacted codes and compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind is sick in body . All of mankind is sick in soul . And one of you says : ' Let us go on precisely as before . At least we shall be moral and dignified . ' And the other says : Let us have an agreeable time . ' As though that were to be had for the wanting . Literature must go upon a voyage of discovery . It must immerse itself in a study of human nature as human nature really is ; it must be uninhibited by such catch-words as license , " savagery , " dignity ' ; it must cooperate with the reason in discovering what is fit and beautiful for such a being as man in such a world as the present . That effort , unhampered by myth and superstition and the cold touch of the dead who knew less than we , has never been attempted . It is being made today . It is being made everywhere . But the new fiction in England and , especially in America , is our best example . These writers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose . " With immorality , sir ! You talk like a Bolshevik !
