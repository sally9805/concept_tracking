SCENE : The dining-room of a small rented , jerry-built house . The walls are papered with a bright rosy pattern . The woodwork is of a cold , shabby white . Cheap engravings and sentimental colored lithographs hang upon the walls , relics of the eighties and nineties . The furniture consists of a " set " of light oak ; there is also a sewing-machine in a corner by a window , and a canary-bird in a cage . To the right are two windows , curtained in light , washable material . On the opposite side of the room is a meretricious fireplace , above it an entrance to a kitchen . At centre is an entrance to the hall , a curtained archway . The rising curtain presents the room in the growing dusk of an October afternoon . By the window at the right sits SARAH LANE in an old-fashioned wooden rocking-chair , making the most of the light for her darning . She is a dark , spare , dry , country-bred woman of some sixty years of age , with thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely , critical of but intensely loyal to her own . Her dress is of black and white print and she wears an apron . By the dining-table , the cloth of which has been replaced by a shabby cover of green , coloring some soldiers which he has drawn on bits of paper , is LITTLE ANDY , an attractive , intelligent lad of six or seven , rather delicate in looks . He is happy and absorbed , chanting softly an impromptu sing-song of " See the brown soldier ! See the blue soldier ! See the red soldier ! " over and over . SARAH irritably.For mercy 's sake , Andy ! You make me as nervous as a cat with that rigamarole of yours . p. 3 ANDY What 's nerves-as-a-cat , granny ? SARAH darning.When you get 's old as I am you 'll know what nervous is all right I guess . I did n't hardly sleep a wink all last night with the teethache , an ' I could n't find nothing to put on it . It 's my belief that that Marthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice . SARAH Oh ! She is  --  is she ? ANDY Uh huh ! SARAH Nicer'n your gran'ma , I s'pose you mean . That 's a pretty way to talk . When I was a little girl I was taught to love my own folks best . She resumes her darning and begins to sing a hymn in a cracked old voice . " There is a fountain filled with blood " ANDY sings also an improvised tune to the words of " Nerves-as-a-cat nerves as-a-cat " SARAH singing . " Drawn from Emmanuel 's veins And sinners plunged " ANDY interrupting.Granny ! SARAH still singing . " Beneath that flood " p. 4 ANDY louder , more insistent.Granny ! SARAH What ? ANDY rising in his chair and kneeling on the big book on which he is sitting , he talks over the back of the chair.Miss Fenton in my kindergarten says you ought to love everybody , ' cause we 're all God 's li'l ' fr'en 's . SARAH severely . " God 's little friends ! " Andy Lane , do n't you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Blessed Redeemer ! Enter MARTHE ROCHE through the kitchen door . She is a young , dark , pretty Belgian girl , plainly but neatly dressed . MARTHE as she is passing from the kitchen to the hall.I go up-stairs to my room , little man , if you want me  --   --  As MARTHE comes into the room ANDY greets her with a " Hello , Marty ! " ANDY Marthe I 'm paintin ' soldiers ! MARTHE glances at the soldiers and smiles approvingly.Nice ! Chic  --  mon petit ! She goes out through the door . ANDY scrambling down from his chair and crossing to SARAH with one of his soldiers.Lookit , granny ! Holds the soldier out to her . Soldier ! p. 5 SARAH taking the picture mechanically.Soldier ! Yer uncle Oswald 's a soldier too ! Suddenly overcome by an emotion that bewilders the child . Oh , Ossie ! Why do n't ye come home ! Why do n't ye come home ! She sobs dryly , crumpling the paper soldier unconsciously in her hand . ANDY in distress , rescuing his soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , an ' you 're cryin ' ! SARAH recovering sharply and pushing the lad away from her , she goes up to the sideboard to take a dose of patent medicine from a large bottle there ; she talks as she goes.Where 'd Marthy say she was goin ' ? ANDY returning to his painting.Up-stairs . SARAH with bottle and spoon in hand.She 's always a-settin ' in her room , that girl . Ai n't worth her keep . ANDY What 's a keep , granny ? SARAH None o ' yer business . Puts bottle and spoon back on the sideboard . Yer ma 'll be gettin ' home pretty soon , and Marthy ought to be settin ' the table fer supper . ANDY singing his improvised tune to the words , " What 's a keep none o ' yer business , " repeating it over and over through SARAH 's speech. p. 6 SARAH You better put yer things away , Andy . ANDY Wo n't Uncle Oswald ever come home , granny ? SARAH challengingly , as she comes down to her chair.Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She sits . I guess he 'll come home to see his mother ! Andy Lane  --  do n't you never believe nothin ' anybody ever tells you about your uncle Oswald  --  never ! ANDY When Uncle Oswal ' comes home , granny  --  do you think he could teach me how to build a camp-fire ? SARAH absently darning again.Camp-fire ? ANDY Yes . SARAH Good land ! Where 'd you ever hear o ' that ? ANDY To the kindergarten . Could he ? SARAH Could he ? I guess so . Absently . Camp-fire ? Land , yes . ANDY Where 's Uncle Oswal ' live ? SARAH I du n no ! Retrospectively , regretfully . I du n no ! Nobody knows . I ai n't seen him for more'n twelve years . He was to the war in France  --  last we heard . He 's ben a hero ! Enter MARTHE from the hall . She goes straight to the table and looks at the soldiers that ANDY is painting. p. 7 MARTHE approvingly , to ANDY.Ah ! SARAH startled.Mercy ! MARTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how you scared me ! I wisht you would n't act like a ghost ' round the home . MARTHE quietly.The world is full of ghosts since the war . Sits at the table and begins to study ; for when she came in from the hall she brought with her a text-book on shorthand , a stenographer 's note-book , and a pencil . SARAH You talk like them spiritualists . Gives me the creeps . ANDY speaking in a combination of French and English . He has picked up the French from MARTHE . Showing her a soldier.Marthe see Gets out of chair and comes to MARTHE . Ray-gard-ay ! Mes soldats . Ray-gard-ay ! MARTHE her arms about him.Mon petit ! They are beautiful ! Tu es artiste toi ! SARAH Marthe , I do n't want you should teach that child anything in that language that ai n't fit for his gran'ma to hear ! p. 8 ANDY singing . " Au clair de la lune &nbsp; Mon ami , Pierrot , Prtes-moi ta plume &nbsp; Pour ecrire un mot " SARAH rubbing her ear.We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My left ear has itched me all day  --  an ' I never knew it to fail . Looks over at MARTHE , who is studying . Marthy ! MARTHE , absorbed , does not hear her . Marthy ! MARTHE Yes , madame ? SARAH You better begin to clear up and get ready for supper . MARTHE rises and goes to ANDY , behind the table.Come , then , my little cabbage , pack up the paint-box . ANDY I do n't want to MARTHE reprovingly.The soldiers must obey orders ! SARAH I do ' know what 's keeping Andy 's mother . She was a-goin ' to get me a little mite of assafetty to the drug-store  --  an ' Andrew ought to be gettin ' home soon , too . To ANDY . Come , now clear up your things and get ready for supper . The outer door is heard to shut off left , in the hall . Enter HESTER in street dress . She carries a hand-bag , two library books , and a periodical , the " Christian Advocate . " p. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's mummy ! What 'd you bring me , mummy ? What 'd you bring me ? Pulls her down stage to left of table . HESTER is a young woman about twenty-six . Neither pretty nor beautiful , she has yet attributes of both states . She has freshness , frankness , and a good deal of charm . Her expression seems to indicate some inner dissatisfaction . Her garments , quite in keeping with her modest circumstances , show good taste in their becoming lines , and she wears them with a certain distinction . HESTER Yes , dear  --  mummy 's home . Why  --  you 're all half in the dark ! She lights the electric drop-light , a hideous thing of varicolored glass over the dining-table . There ! She pushes a button at the left of the door at centre , and illuminates the room . You 'll ruin your eyes , mother sewing like that . ANDY insistently.What 'd you bring me , mummy ? HESTER I 've brought two new books from the library  --  and your Christian Advocate , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some " Life-Savers " in my bag for a little boy named ANDY seizes her hand-bag and opens it . Dearie ! Do n't grab ! And do n't spill everything out ! As he takes the candies out of the bag . You may have just two . She crosses back of the table. p. 10 SARAH rising , going to the window and pulling down the shades.Lucky somebody saves ' lectricity in this family  --  er that there 's any to save . MARTHE is carrying ANDY 's playthings , that litter the floor , over to the serving-table , and placing them on the bottom shelf . You 're allus complainin ' these days , Hester , for somethin ' you have n't got . What 's got into you ? ' S a bad sign . ANDY running to SARAH with the candies.Granny you can have two  --  too . SARAH Do ' want ' em  --  spoil my supper ! To HESTER . Did you get me that assafetty ? HESTER Oh , mother  --  I  --   --  SARAH in lofty resignation.Forgot it ! I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can pass another sleepless night . HESTER I Just let me get my things off and I 'll MARTHE takes her hat and coat as she removes them . Oh , thank you , Martha . Did you get some studying done ? MARTHE It is very hard . I try my most best  --  but I get discouraged often . She goes out into the hall with HESTER 's wraps. p. 11 HESTER I do n't wonder . Everything seems all wrong nowadays . But do n't worry . It 'll come all right , I guess . Turns to ANDY . Darling  --  have you been a good body ? ANDY showing his painted soldiers.I been paintin ' . See my soldiers , mummy ? I love soldiers . SARAH He 's set there the hull livelong afternoon , Hester . They ai n't a thing the matter with him . I can tell you my boys was n't coddled like that . HESTER looking at the soldiers.Yes , dear , they 're beautiful . As she sees SARAH looking at her reprovingly . I know , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that absorbs her . Martha ! MARTHE appearing in the hall.Yes , Mrs. Lane . Comes in at centre . HESTER I wish you 'd run down to Simpson 's drug-store and get a little assaftida for MARTHE puzzled over the word.Fettit ? ANDY , sitting on the arm of an old leather chair by the fireplace , is so amused at this that he falls over back-ward into the chair , mimicking MARTHE 's attempt at pronouncing the word. p. 12 HESTER Here ! I 'll write the name on this piece of paper . For mother , it is . ANDY Take me ? HESTER Yes , you can take Andy . ANDY clapping his hands.Oh , goody , goody ! HESTER Only wrap his throat well Giving MARTHE the piece of paper with the word written on it . Twenty-five cents ' worth . Gets a coin out of her hand-bag . Here it is . Gives coin to ANDY . And do n't lose it . Run along now . She follows them to the hall as ANDY and MARTHE exit . SARAH in the rocking-chair.An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . Guess a dose of Rochelle salts 'd be better . I et somethin ' that kinda laid on my stomick . Suddenly becomes aware that HESTER is looking at her with a curious expression . What ? HESTER coming down toward SARAH , her eyes shining with excitement.Mother ! I 've got something to tell you . While I was out I met Hilda Pierce at the library . She 's just back from France . You remember her . She went with the Red Cross . Oh , she had such a wonderful experience ! p. 13 SARAH Women better stay to home where they belong . If the men want to fight , let ' em . HESTER Hilda was in a sort of group  --  I do n't know  --  that visited hospitals and things  --  wrote letters for the men  --  and talked to them . SARAH I guess she talked to ' em , all right . HESTER Mother  --  she saw  --  Oswald ! SARAH rises and comes to her in agitation.Oswal ' ! Tell it  --  ca n't you ? Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead is he ? HESTER patting her hand soothingly.No he is n't dead . Or , at least , I do n't think so . It was in a hospital  --  I ca n't remember the place  --  and this man was wounded  --  it was toward the end of the war it happened . Hilda got acquainted with this man . His name was Lane , he said . Then  --  one day it all came out that he was Andrew 's brother . SARAH with almost a sob.Oh , my Lord ! Was he real sick , did she say ? HESTER His leg was bad , but the doctors said he 'd get well . He did n't know anything about Andrew being married to me , or you being with us , or anything . Hilda was going to write a letter to you for him , but before she got to it they moved him off to another hospital  --  somewhere  --  and she never saw him again . p. 14 SARAH anxiously.And she do ' know where he is now ? HESTER No . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with ours . In a thing they call the " Foreign Legion . " And he was all decorated . He 'd been perfectly splendid , she said . Just a regular hero . Oh , mother , I think it 's just fine  --  after everything that that SARAH abruptly and suspiciously.Everything ? What 'd Andrew ever tell you about Oswal ' , I 'd like to know ? HESTER getting her work-basket from the machine.Why  --  nothing so very much , except that he was  --  well , pretty wild when he was a boy , and ran away and all that . Why ? SARAH only half assured that HESTER is speaking the truth.Nothin ' ! That 's why . An ' if you ever hear anything real bad about my Oswal , ' t'ai n't true ! An ' do n't you believe it is . He wa' n't such a good son as Andrews , but he wa' n't bad . He wa' n't bad , I tell you ! HESTER sitting at the table and mending one of her gloves.Andrew never said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilda said he was handsome . Handsome , in spite of being sick . Oh , I 'd have given  --  I do n't know what , for her experience . p. 15 SARAH I guess Oswald 's ' bout as good-lookin ' as the Lord intended men-folks should be , though that ai n't nothin ' for a man to boast of . She said he wa' n't wounded bad ? HESTER No . His foot or his leg , I think . SARAH meditatively.Oh , dear  --  if I could only see ' im ! Hester , you ai n't suffered . You ai n't suffered . I tell you women has to suffer . Then they know . HESTER not bitterly , but regretfully.Oh , it 's hard enough this is , when you 're never sure from one week 's end to another where the money 's coming from to pay the bills . It seems to me that lately , everywhere I go , everything I do , I just find pretty things thrown in my face Only , I ca n't have them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do like what 's nice , but interesting things . Things that give women a chance to look outside their own little dooryards  --  I do n't know  --  to be something . Something that counts more in the world  --  I ca n't express it and I do n't suppose you 'd understand . But it 's always been like that  --  just scraping along , mamma and I , in that boarding-house in Brooklyn . SARAH who has listened to these words with sniffs of disdain.Well , Hester Lane ! Of all the speeches I ever heard ! Pretty things ! Interestin ' things ! I never ! I du n no what women 's comin ' to nowadays ! Votin ' ! I s'pose you 'll want to be votin ' too  --  an ' dancin ' ! Women 's old 's I be hoppin ' ' round like monkeys on a hot stove-lid ; and a smokin ' of them nasty cigarettes ! Their legs a-showin ' at one end , and their backs and bosoms at ' tother ! You , a married woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a girl should want . Talkin ' like that ! I 'm ashamed of you ! Hester ! A chance ! Chance , fiddlesticks ! p. 16 HESTER out of patience.You do n't understand ! I ca n't tell you ! I ca n't ever tell you . You always scold me like this . SARAH with sarcasm.Next thing you 'll want to get a divorce , I s'pose  --  like all the rest of ' em . HESTER amused.Divorce ? You do n't think I 'm going to run away , do you ? SARAH horrifiedly.Hester  --  for the Lord 's sake ! You ai n't thinkin ' of runnin ' away ? HESTER clearing the toys from table and getting ready for the evening meal . The toys she puts on the bottom shelf of the serving-table.I 've never thought of such a thing . Run ! Run where ? What for ? With a husband and baby who need me ? More softly as she goes to the right of the rocking-chair . Mother  --  did n't you feel  --  sometimes , on that awful farm  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't you ? SARAH in an embarrassed voice and with a note of confession.They was allus a dress I wanted . I see it once in the city when I was a young gal . White muslin with flounces and lace and a green ribbon edge to ' em . Dryly , coming out of her mood . But I never got it . p. 17 HESTER Poor mother ! The two women busy themselves in getting the room ready for supper , clearing the things from the dining-table , changing the table-cloth , and setting out dishes . The following conversation takes place while they are thus occupied . SARAH Hester , I do ' want you should get no foolish notions in your head about bein ' too good for your home . Andrew 's a good man , Hester , a good man . HESTER mechanically , busy with her own thoughts.Oh , yes , Andrew 's a good man . SARAH eying her keenly.He 's better'n you think . HESTER Than I think ? SARAH Maybe you 'll have to git your nose right down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as you think you do now . HESTER I 've suffered enough . There are different ways of suffering . SARAH taking the white table-cloth from the drawer in the sideboard and dropping it on the table before HESTER.Pooh ! You ! You 're like all the women nowadays  --  wantin ' somethin ' you have n't got an ' callin ' that sufferin ' . She goes out to the kitchen . The front door-bell rings . HESTER answers it . A man 's voice  --  OSWALD 's  --  is heard in the hall. p. 18 OSWALD off stage.Does Andrew Lane live here ? HESTER Yes . But he is n't home yet . Did you wish to see him about something ? OSWALD Well , I kinda wanted to HESTER Wo n't you step in ? HESTER appears at the doorway with OSWALD . He is a young man about twenty-eight , of more than ordinary good looks , somewhat marred by dissipation , rough living , and vagabond wanderings . Despite his battered past , he has kept a certain appealing young charm , a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moral weakness . The sort of man likely to be rashly loved and rashly forgiven by most women , many men , children , and dogs . He is dressed very shabbily in cheap garments of various colors and qualities . In his buttonhole are tiny ribbons indicative of military decorations . He is slightly lame and carries a stick . On a lead he has a wretched little yellow dog . My husband ought to be here very soon . Glancing at the clock on the mantel . He 's generally on the 5.45 . If you care to wait  --   --  OSWALD gazing about the room with interest.Why  --  no  --  I guess I 'll maybe I 'll go back toward the station , I might run across him . p. 19 HESTER eying him curiously.Yes , you might . Who shall I tell him called  --  if you should n't happen to ? OSWALD Why I used to know ' im  --  a good while ago . I was from the same hick town as he was , and I happened to hear he lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? HESTER Yes , I am . Smiling . Andrew would be so pleased , I 'm sure , to see anybody who  --  His mother , Mrs. Lane , is living with us . You very likely remember her . If you 'd care to see her , she OSWALD turns away embarrassed.Do n't trouble now no I How is the old lady ? HESTER Oh Mother Lane 's pretty well , thank you . She OSWALD grins as he sees a patent-medicine bottle on side-board.Still taking patent medicine , is she ? HESTER with an amused little laugh.Oh ! You do know her , do n't you ? OSWALD dryly.Used to . Awkwardly . Well guess I 'll be pushin ' along . Pleased to have met you , Mrs. Lane . Sees a match-safe on the mantel . Say could I have one of those matches ? He has an unlighted cigarette in his fingers . I 'm all out . p. 20 HESTER amused and amazed.Oh , yes . OSWALD goes to the mantel to get a match . He catches sight of a photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse me but that 's a fine little kid there . Geez  --  he 's a peach ! HESTER flattered.Well  --  we think so . That 's our little boy . Little Andrew . OSWALD You do n't say so ? Guess Andrew 's pretty well fixed , ai n't he ? Looks pretty nice here . You and the kid  --  and all . Smiles impudently and charmingly . HESTER flushing.Well  --  we  --  of course  --  it 's our home  --  and we OSWALD Some fellows are lucky . Now look at me ! You would n't think I owned part of the Waldorf-Astoria and two cars , and had champagne for breakfast , would you ? HESTER catching the spirit of his jesting.Well  --  of course She smiles . OSWALD grins with her boyishly . OSWALD Well  --  I 'll prob'ly see Andrew at the station . Glad to have met you .  --  Good night to you , Mrs. Lane . p. 21 HESTER What name shall I say if OSWALD Little Willie  --  little Willie Smart ! G'night ! He goes out into the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up to the door . She glances into the hall in amusement and astonishment at the odd visitor . SARAH entering from the kitchen , a shawl over her shoulders and a cup in her hand . I run over to them Conleys to borrow a little mite o ' m'lasses for my gingerbread . Who was that you was talkin ' to just now ? HESTER crosses to the sideboard , takes an apron from the upper drawer , and puts it on.Why  --  he was the funniest man ! You could n't help but like him . He was just as fresh as he could be . Came to see Andrew . Said he knew him as a boy . And he knows you , too , mother . SARAH Land sakes ! Who was he ? HESTER setting the table.He said his name was Willie Smart . SARAH Smart ? Smart ? Wa' n't no Smarts in Fisherville that I ever heard of . What 'd he look like ? HESTER Poor and sickly , but sort of nice  --  sort of  --  I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lame . p. 22 SARAH There wa' n't no Smarts there , never ! Hester , you mark my words , he 's a burglar , sure as you live and breathe . HESTER Nonsense , mother . I 'd have trusted him . SARAH You 're a fool . You 're too tender-hearted . HESTER Suppose somebody turned your son Oswald out  --  if he was poor and sick . I guess you 'd resent that . SARAH I tell you there wa' n't no Smarts there . You get that Pierce girl here to-morrow . I want to talk to her ' bout Oswal ' . HESTER stops setting the table  --  abruptly.What made Oswald run  --  really ? What made him run away ? SARAH letting the more human side of her nature show for a moment.Hester  --  they 's things between a woman and her husband , an ' between a woman and her son  --  no matter what deviltry he gets into  --  that no man can make head nor tail of . But a woman knows . Recovering her usual manner and starting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm goin ' to make my gingerbread . The telephone-bell rings . Ai n't that that old telephone ringin ' ? HESTER It 's the coal man , I guess . He said he 'd telephone to-day the best he could do about our bill . She goes out into the hall to answer the telephone , talking as she goes . I do n't know how we 're going to get along . It 's all so high . p. 23 SARAH My mouth tastes like a copper kittle . Bile , I guess . She goes into the kitchen . HESTER out in the hall , at the telephone.Yes  --  yes  --  More excited . No !  --  Now  --  Oh ! Runs excitedly into the room and to the swing door of the kitchen . Mother  --  Mother Lane ! SARAH as she enters.What ? What is it ? HESTER He  --  he 's here ! SARAH Who ? HESTER Your Oswald ! SARAH Oswal ' ! I do n't believe it ! HESTER Andrew ! He 's telephoned ! To prepare us ! From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He and Oswald . Now ! In a minute ! SARAH Oh , my good Lord ! The two women stare at each other , bewildered . HESTER with a sudden thought.I wonder if if it could be ? Why yes ! Willie Smart ! SARAH She sinks into a chair by the table . My boy  --  Oswal ' !  --  Comin ' home !  --  Are you sure ?  --  They ai n't no mistake ? Twelve years !  --  My boy ! HESTER soothes her with exclamations of sympathy . Oh , my Lord ! He 's comin ' home ! Bustling about . Well  --  he 'll want his supper ! We better git the table set right off ! As she stands by the table she takes a fork in her hand and holds it out . What 'd I tell you this mornin '  --  when I dropped that fork and it stuck right up in the floor ? Visitor comin ' ! Is they any sour milk in the house ? If there is I 'll mix up a pancake-batter fer supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand there 's if you was moonstruck ! Do somethin ' ! My land ! My land ! SARAH rushes off into the kitchen . HESTER has paused in the act of setting the table , a dish in her hand , as one gazing on some inner vision. p. 24 HESTER back of the table , half to herself.It 's so  --  so strange  --  coming  --  like this  --  just after Hilda 's telling us . It makes me feel SARAH rushes in from the kitchen . SARAH Where 's he goin ' to sleep , I 'd like to know ? HESTER Oh , dear ! Well  --  he 'll have to have Martha 's bed  --  that 's all . He 's been a soldier and deserves the best we can do . And Martha will have to sleep on that cot in the attic . SARAH And plenty good enough for her , I say . I ai n't a-goin ' to have her tryin ' none of her monkey-shines on my Oswal ' ! She hurries back into the kitchen . HESTER She crosses left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody  --  somebody who 'd understand what I She is at the centre of the stage when the door is heard to slam . There is the sound of feet and voices . ANDREW calling from the hall.Ma ! Hester ! Hey there ! We got ' im ! By gosh ! We caught a hero ! ANDREW and OSWALD enter at the arch . OSWALD still has the dog on the lead and is carrying a battered old suitcase . ANDREW LANE is a man about forty , growing fattish and bald . He is dressed in worn but very neat clothes . His face shows unmistakably his simplicity of nature , his indefatigable good humor , his affectionate heart , his lack of mental capacity to carry him further than he is to-day  --  a faithful and honest insurance clerk  --  and his reliability as a husband , a son , and a citizen . His fixed belief that everything is going to turn out right helps him cheerfully to face the financial worries from which he has never in his life had a respite . He has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is particularly distasteful to HESTER . He carries in his hands two packages from the grocer's. p. 25 HESTER running to the door.Mother come ! Catches sight of OSWALD . Willie Smart is Oswald ! SARAH rushes in from the kitchen and into OSWALD 's arms , who is in the centre of the stage , where ANDREW has shoved him , good-naturedly . ANDREW is laughing in boisterous good humor . OSWALD while ANDREW and HESTER look on delightedly.Ma ! SARAH sobs the inarticulate motherings of a woman to whom the prodigal son is still a boy of sixteen , the age at which she last saw him . Why , ma ! Do n't take on so . Ma ! Smile for the gentleman ! Holds her off at arms ' length . Ai n't a day older , is she , Andy ? ANDREW Should say not ! Regular chicken ! SARAH who , unused to displaying emotion , has recovered her poise.Well  --  so you 've got here at last . Took you long enough . You got here for your birthday . Lemme look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of what the cat dragged in ? Kisses HESTER , who is in front of the table . Hey there , old son  --  this is your sister , Hester  --  guess she 'll give you a kiss , too . Go to it , Bo ! p. 26 OSWALD I never had a sister ANDREW laughing.He 's bashful ! OSWALD with his most disarming smile , looks straight into HESTER 's eyes , then goes to her and kisses her on the lips.Gee  --  I 'm glad it 's you ! HESTER rather confused.And I never had a brother  --  Oh why did n't you tell me it was you just now ? I almost gussed it I OSWALD Well  --  what do you know about that ? Say , sister , we 've got to make up for lost time . ANDREW laughing.No time like the present ! OSWALD I wanted to see Andy first . I did n't know whether he 'd want a poor nut like me to come in here and muss up his front parlor . ANDREW Aw , shut up ! Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got out of the train , he did . Seeing OSWALD with his hat in his hand , he crosses up to him and takes the hat . Here  --  gim me that ! Just landed this morning , he did ! And he says " Hello , And ' ! " natural 's if he 'd been walking in for the last ten years . I darn near thought I 'd gone nuts when he says " Hello , And ' ! " Just like He goes out to the hall with OSWALD 's hat , chattering on to himself. p. 27 SARAH seeing the dog.My Lord o ' love ! For mercy 's sake , where 'd you get that dog ? OSWALD She 's a war dog . Ai n't you , Cafard ? Cafard 's her name . French . Means " the blues . " I collected her in Belgium , or she collected me .

He 's sharper'n a tack . OSWALD looking admiringly at HESTER.Looks to me as if you 'd got pretty near everything a fellow needs , Andy , to keep comfortable . ANDREW arms about HESTER.Oh  --  we kinda manage to trail ' long by the band-wagon , do n't we , Hester ? HESTER nods a tolerant smile  --  ANDREW looks at the dog again . Say speaking of dogs , I heard a good one to-day ! p. 28 HESTER Now , Andrew ANDREW Honest I did , Hess . " If I cut that dog open what would I find ? " Thinks for a second . No that ai n't it . Here it is  --  " If I cut that dog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grins happily as he answers the riddle . Why  --  the seat of his pants ! HESTER Oh , Andrew ! You ought to be ashamed . OSWALD Gosh ! And ' ! He is now sitting in the rocking-chair , and SARAH is hovering around him . Are you still at them old gags ? First time I heard that I kicked the slats out of my cradle , did n't I , ma ? You ought to muzzle him , Hester . HESTER laughingly.I will . ANDREW still laughing.Well  --  we ca n't all be born with a funny-bone . HESTER starts for the kitchen . ANDREW picks up the two packages which he laid on the table at the beginning of the scene . Here 's your coffee , Hess Following her toward the kitchen . And your prunes . Cost just double now . HESTER at the door up left.And the  --   --  ? p. 29 ANDREW snapping his fingers.Gosh ! I forgot the soap ! HESTER goes into the kitchen , followed by ANDREW . They are heard off stage talking about OSWALD 's unexpected return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't you well ? Does your foot hurt you ? You ai n't had nothin ' to eat , I bet , since you joined that ol ' war  --  The idee ! Comin ' and pretendin ' to be Willie Smart ! If I 'd a-seen you I 'd a Willie Smarted you ! OSWALD Sure ! I 'm well , ma . HESTER and ANDREW enter again from the kitchen . Do n't you fret ! We et the Germans ! ANDREW Sausages ! There is a general laugh . OSWALD I was afraid you 'd spank me , like you used to ! ANDREW And she did , too ! SARAH Guess you want a good tonic . That 's what ! OSWALD Guess I want some of ma 's cooking  --  to take the taste o ' Huns out o ' my mouth . General laughter . SARAH My soul and body ! Guess folks better eat first and visit afterwards . And that Marthy gone out  --  Crosses over to the kitchen . Come , Hester  --  Exits into kitchen. p. 30 OSWALD rising.Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  quit yer kiddin ' ! HESTER I do n't know whether you 'll understand about Martha  --  you see  --   --  HESTER and ANDREW come close to OSWALD to tell him about MARTHE . ANDREW Martha 's a girl Hess took  --  I call her Mattie for short  --  makes her feel more at home . HESTER Yes ANDREW Oh  --  Hess got all het up about the war . You see , Mattie 's a Belgian . Some folks brought her over here in 1915  --   --  HESTER The second year of the war  --   --  ANDREW She 's an orphan . Folks killed in the war  --  right in front of her . She kinda helps Hester . She 'll go ' way pretty soon , I guess . Studyin ' to be a stenographer HESTER Of course , being a foreigner it 's hard for her and ANDREW We give her what we can  --  and  --  it 's an expense housing her . But the missis was all for it . I du n no as He walks out to the hall , talking to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house-coat  --  an antiquated jacket . The gist of his mutterings is as follows : Mattie 's all right , I s'pose  --  ' Course she ca n't help what happened in the war  --  etc. p. 31 HESTER I wanted to do something . Andrew thought we could n't . We  --  oh  --  it seemed so dreadful not to help poor little Belgium ! It was n't much  --  but it was our little bit . I  --  I wanted to do such a lot  --  you understand ? Like you . I  --  I wanted to  --  Oh , we 've heard  --  we 've heard just to-day about you ! ANDREW has now changed into his house-coat , and comes out of the hall with a pair of gaily embroidered slippers in his hand . He goes down by the big chair.She ai n't a bad little girl  --  Mattie ai n't . OSWALD to HESTER , flattered.Me ? Aw  --  who 's been handin ' you the bunk about me ? Do n't you HESTER You were splendid ! We know  --  and you were wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking-chair soldier ? HESTER her eyes shining with excitement . Turns to ANDREW.Andrew  --  he was just wonderful ! Why , Hilda Pierce is back from France , and she says  --  Looking at OSWALD , who is facing them . And just look at the ribbons in his buttonhole ! ANDREW laughing boisterously.Thought they was somethin ' some girl give him . SARAH LANE enters from the kitchen and starts for the sideboard , just in time to hear the last of this remark. p. 32 SARAH Mercy , Oswal ' ! You ai n't married , are you ? OSWALD front of rocking-chair , grinning.Sure , ma ! Two twins right outside in the limousine . I call ' em Clemenceau an ' Lloyd George for short . Want to see ' em ? General laughter , during which SARAH goes to the sideboard and gets a dish . SARAH as she goes to the kitchen door.Smarty ! At the door up left . Well  --  you need n't bring none of them foreign hussies home to me ! As she leaves by the kitchen door the outer door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we hear  --   --  . HESTER running up to door.There they are now ! ANDREW crossing and taking the dog from OSWALD.It 's " Little Andy . " HESTER Andy , hurry  --   --  LITTLE ANDY and MARTHE appear in the arch . During the excitement MARTHE disappears . ANDREW See who 's here ! HESTER to LITTLE ANDY , who stands gazing in wonder at the stranger.Look , darling ! There 's Uncle Oswald ! The lad runs straight down the stage and into OSWALD 's arms. p. 33 OSWALD sweeping the boy from his feet and holding him high in his arms.Hello there , General Pershing ! Where 'd you leave your staff ? ANDREW is taking the scene in from the centre of the stage , looking on with paternal pride . HESTER taking off the boy 's hat and coat as she speaks.It 's Uncle Oswald , darling ! He 's come home from France , where he was  --  oh , just the most wonderful soldier  --   --  ANDY fascinated by his new uncle , and quite at his ease.Granny says you 're a hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit your kiddin ' , general  --   --  OSWALD is quite as pleased with LITTLE ANDY as ANDY is with him . ANDY as he sees the dog , held by ANDREW on the leash.Lemme down ! I want to pat ' im . He gets down from OSWALD 's arms and runs to the dog , going down on his knees to caress the animal . Look , daddy ! ANDREW looking critically at the dog.What kind is he , Os ? OSWALD He 's a she ! General laughter. p. 34 ANDY Uncle Os granny says you 're a hero ! OSWALD on his knees by the dog.Ssh ! Do n't you tell Cafard I 'm a hero . She might bite me . ANDY What is a hero , Uncle Os ? OSWALD Oh  --  Grins . A hero is a guy that does somethin ' he would n't a-done , if he 'd stopped to think . General laughter . ANDY Show me how to build a camp-fire , Uncle Oswald ? OSWALD Sure , I 'll teach you how to build a camp-fire ! ANDY clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls.Martha ! I guess she 's gone up-stairs . I 'll run and tell her to fix the bed for Oswald . Then you can bring him up , Andy , so he can wash for supper if he wants to . To LITTLE ANDY . Andy  --  you take doggy To OSWALD shyly . What 's his name , Oswald ? OSWALD Her name is Cafard . HESTER Take Cafard  --  out to granny in the kitchen , and see if she ca n't find him a nice little dinner . Goes out into the hall. p. 35 ANDREW takes LITTLE ANDY to kitchen with the dog.There you go , Hagenbeck ! ANDY takes the dog out . ANDREW and OSWALD are left alone . There is a pause . Each is looking at the other , old memories in their minds . OSWALD is rather self-conscious . Well , Os ? OSWALD Well , Andy ? ANDREW nodding toward the arch.Pretty nice little girl , huh ? OSWALD Ay  --  ugh ! ANDREW Le 's sit down . That bum foot of yours  --  OSWALD sits in the rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  we got our little home . ' Tai n't the Waldorf , but I guess we 're pretty lucky , all right . Kinda hard to keep things going these days what with old high-cost-of-living and all . But " Do n't worry 's " my motto  --   --  OSWALD Mine , too . ANDREW When pa died  --  you knew about his dyin ' , did n't you , Os ? OSWALD Um-hum . ANDREW Ma come here to live with us . Pa did n't leave a red cent . When everything was settled , and the debts paid , there was n't a darn thing but just a little furniture ma hung onto . p. 36 OSWALD with a little embarrassment.I was a good deal of a darn fool in those days , Andy  --  I du n no why I ever got into that mix-up . ANDREW awakwardly.I s'pose most every fellow wonders that  --  when it 's over  --  I do n't know  --  I 'm no better than anybody else  --  do n't pretend to be . Only I never had the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now  --  with Hess and the kid  --  I  --   --  OSWALD sincerely.Well , you can mark it right down in your diary that little old Os is going to play straight from now on . Honest , I am , And ' . ANDREW I 'm glad to hear it , Os OSWALD has a cigarette in his mouth and is searching his pockets for a match . ANDREW takes a match from his own pocket , crosses to OSWALD , and strikes the match . We 're right with you . Lights OSWALD 's cigarette . OSWALD Say  --  was pa ?  --  When he found out  --   --  ? ANDREW frankly  --  but kindly.It pretty near killed him . I guess it did , anyway . You see  --  well  --  the money part of it was awful tough  --  but when it came out about Millie  --  he  --  well , I guess you know how he 'd feel . Os  --  she 's on the streets now in Rochester , they say . p. 37 OSWALD comes toward ANDREW.Damn it ! I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever treated me like  --  Oh well  --  what 's the use  --   --  ANDREW Boy  --  I do n't want you should ever say anything  --  too  --  hard against the old man . He come right acrost when it was up to him . And so did ma . And nobody ever knew the worst of it but old Peters in the bank and us . Folks did n't even know about Millie . OSWALD Say , Andy  --  Nods toward the arch , HESTER in his mind , embarrassed . Does  --  she know ? ANDREW Hess ? OSWALD Um-hum . ANDREW No . I never told Hester a word  --  beyond  --  well , that you was a pretty frisky young fellow , and run away from home . Pa and I  --  you know that part . He worked and paid back the money on that check you  --  and the bank let it drop . It came hard for us , Os , but if you 've learned your lesson  --  why  --   --  OSWALD dropping uneasily back into the rocker.Much obliged  --  Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And , Os , I appreciate your wantin ' to see me first before you told Hess who you were . Putting his hand on OSWALD 's shoulder affectionately . I do n't want to pick open any old sores , boy , specially to-night , when you 've just come home to us . And I just want to tell you that what 's done 's done . Nothin 's gained by harping on old mistakes . You 're back , and I guess you 've about wiped out all that tomfoolishness  --  or worse  --  by what you 've done over there  --  in the war . I guess they did n't give you those ribbons in your buttonhole for lookin ' at the view . But now the old war 's over and everybody 's glad of it . Boy , I want you should make my home your home till you get a start , till you get a job , gol darn it , till you get a little home and a cutie of your own . See ? He sings in comic fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as happy as can be  --  For there 's no place like Home , Sweet Home ! " p. 38 OSWALD rises and goes to ANDREW.You 're damn kind , Andy . I  --  I  --  appreciate how you all have treated me . Far 's the war 's concerned , as the Irishman says , " ' T was a hell of a war , but ' t was the only war we had ! " ANDREW Gee ! That 's a good one ! Have to remember that . OSWALD I 'm goin ' to pull up , Andy , and  --  well , I got one or two little things in my head . I 'm going to pay you back every cent . We 'll be rich yet , and then , by God , we 'll SARAH appears at the kitchen door . SARAH Just wanted to see if you was really there , sonny ! ANDREW jovially.No , ma  --  he 's gone to take his music-lesson ! SARAH Your ma 's making pancakes ! OSWALD Hurray for ma ! Bocou pancakes ! SARAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OSWALD Look ! You got ma pullin ' them nifties ! Gee , And ' ! It 's bon to be back just lemme get started again and ANDREW consulting the book.Say  --  d'j ever hear this one , Os ? " If a man ate his mother-in-law , what 'd he be ? " p. 39 OSWALD No , and I do n't want to . All the eats I 'm interested in now is ma 's pancakes . Say , you ought to have that Joe Miller nerve killed , And ' ! ANDREW No honest this is a good one . HESTER appears in the arch . HESTER Now you boys have got to stop talking and get right out of the dining-room . We 'll never get supper ready . Comes down to the table . OSWALD Gee ! Listen to General Joffer ! Where 's the nearest dugout , And ' ? ANDREW in great good humor.Did I ever tell you this one , Hess ? OSWALD whispers laughingly to HESTER . Just telling Os " If a man ate his mother-in-law , what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shout before ANDREW has a chance to speak.For Heaven 's sake , stop ! You give us an awful pain ! ANDREW not at all discomfited , determined to get out the joke.You think you 're funny , do n't you ? Glad-i-a-tor ! HESTER Help ! OSWALD Ow ! p. 40 HESTER Now , Andy , you go up in the attic and open that trunk and get out another blanket for Oswald 's bed , while Martha sets the table . Now march ! ANDREW goes to the fireplace and begins to take off his shoes . He sits in the big leather chair.All right . OSWALD I guess I 'll have a look at ma and little old Cafard . As he leaves . And the kid Say  --  he 's a bird , Hester . HESTER smiles . HESTER busy at the table.Run along , Andrew . We 've lots to do . Sees what ANDREW is doing . Oh , must you take your shoes off , Andrew ? ANDREW Aw  --  Hess , my feet get so darned tired , tramping around all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? What do you think of him ? HESTER diffidently.He does n't look very well , does he ? I suppose he 's suffered dreadfully , over there , in the war . I wonder how he 'll like it here ? How he 'll like us ? ANDREW How ? Gosh , he thinks you 're a great little girl . Said so . And , by golly , you are too . Snaps his fingers. p. 41 HESTER reprovingly but not angrily . She has been saying this for years.Stop snapping your fingers . She smiles as she thinks of OSWALD . Does he ? Really ? ANDREW seriously.Say , Hess , now Os has come back , do n't you think we kinda ought to hint to Mattie that she 'd better begin to look for a job some place ? I guess she 's about good enough now to go into somebody 's office , somewhere , as a stenographer , ai n't she ? HESTER Oh , Andrew ! She stops working and looks at him wearily . Why do you begin that again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers . Do n't snap  --  a thousand times . I tell you she 's not ready . I feel a duty to her . We 're all she 's got since the war . Why do you say this ? ANDREW in embarrassment , OSWALD 's past in his mind.Well  --  hang it all  --  Os being back  --  and the expense  --  and  --  well , you see , Os HESTER cutting him short.I just wo n't have it , Andrew , and that 's all . When she 's ready to go , she 'll go . Now please run up and find the blanket . ANDREW rises and starts for the arch . He shakes his head dubiously . HESTER sees this ; it irritates her . And do n't shake your head like that . p. 42 ANDREW At this , ANDREW shakes his head affirmatively ; at centre he meets MARTHE , who enters . Hello , Mattie . MARTHE Good evening , sir . She comes down the stage as ANDREW leaves the room . HESTER Well , Martha , if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get supper ready . She looks at the table , trying to think of some way to make it more than ordinarily attractive . I 'm going up-stairs and get those pretty doilies that you embroidered for me for my birthday . We 've never used them . I wish we had some flowers for the table , too  --  but we have n't . When I 'm rich , I 'll always have flowers on the table . MARTHE My mother loved also flowers . Always the little bunch of them in a glass . She looks over toward the serving-table and sees a potted plant there . Smiles . What if I put the pot of red ger-an-i-mums there in the middle ? HESTER Oh , do ! How nice ! MARTHE fetching the flowers from the serving-table and placing them in the centre of the dining-room table , which is now all set . Wistfully.You are all so happy to-night . Your soldier has come back . p. 43 HESTER patting her affectionately.Martha  --  do n't be sad . You 're one of us . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She leaves through the arch . MARTHE goes over to the sideboard , opens a drawer there and takes out some napkins . As she is arranging them OSWALD enters . OSWALD seeing MARTHE.Hello ! MARTHE coming to the table for something.Good evening , sir . OSWALD coming nearer the table . Looking at her appraisingly.I guess you 're Martha . MARTHE Yes . OSWALD I 'm Oswald  --  the prodigal son  --  the champion veal-eater . MARTHE puzzled at the words . " Veal-eater  --   --  ? " Between them is the table . Mischievously . I thought you were a hero  --  M'sieu . OSWALD God !  --  have you got that , too ? MARTHE busies herself at the table without replying . Familiarly . You 're a Belgian . p. 44 MARTHE Oui . OSWALD I bin up in your country  --  visitin ' King Albert  --  and Mrs. King . MARTHE , unable to resist his contagious good humor , smiles too . Oh  --  you can smile , can you ? Getting more familiar . Martha  --  I 'm going to call you Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into horrible French . Martha  --  vouset tray jollee ! MARTHE with apparent coolness . M'sieu est flatteur . Goes up to the napkins . Then he tiptoes up behind her and attempts to kiss her . Ah  --  no ! With his arm about her , the two struggle and come down stage , OSWALD laughing and still attempting to kiss her . She strikes at him , and tries to get away . OSWALD holding her laughingly , despite her struggles.Aw  --  say , Martha ! Hit a poor soldier ? Why , say , I bin fightin ' for your country  --  Got wounded up there  --  see that lane foot ? Releases the girl . Vous et naughty girl ! MARTHE in a tone of reverence.Fighting  --  for my country ! OSWALD , taking advantage of her mood , tries again to kiss her . She holds him off . Ah , no ! Please ! She looks him piteously in the face , overcome by a sudden emotion . In a low tone , as it were almost sacramental . It is I who kiss you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and then , embarrassed at her act , she quickly crosses and goes out to the kitchen. p. 45 OSWALD gazing after her.You 're a funny kid ! Left alone , he takes from his pocket a soiled letter which he glances at with a grunt of satisfaction and pleasure . He puts the letter away . Enter HESTER with the doilies in her hand . HESTER coming down to the table . Oh ! There you are ! Oh  --  you 've made Andrew and your mother so happy , coming home like this . Why , only this afternoon , before Andy telephoned  --  we 'd heard about Hilda 's seeing you and all . And your mother just cried  --  and cried . Oh ! It 's just wonderful ! And how you fooled me  --  at first ! Once or twice it crossed my mind , when you looked at the baby 's picture  --  oh  --  how could you ? OSWALD I do n't suppose it makes much difference to you , my coming back , does it ? HESTER Do you want me to say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingratiatingly.You 're awful good to  --  to your little brother . HESTER You 're the first hero we 've ever had . OSWALD Aw  --  cut that hero stuff out  --  Hester . HESTER I can hardly wait for you to tell me all about your experiences in the war . They 've laughed at me so here  --  because I cared about the war so  --  oh , I did care ! Awfully ! Like you ! p. 46 OSWALD amused.Like me ? HESTER But you must have . If you went there . OSWALD Oh ! With an amused little whistle on two notes . HESTER And now you 're coming back  --  one of us  --  from the war ! It makes it more  --  ours . Do n't you see ? Gives us a share in it . OSWALD admiringly.Say , you 're a regular little patriot , eh ? Hip hip stuff ! Maliciously . Brother Andy did n't go to war  --  did he ? HESTER behind table , flushing.No . He could n't  --  he  --  you see , with us women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? HESTER evadingly.How could he ? Defiantly . If it had n't been for baby , I 'd have gone . I 'd have loved going ! And doing anything . Washing dishes , scrubbing floors ! Washing the boys ' clothes . Anybody who 's been there is just wonderful to me ! OSWALD with satisfaction.Oh ! I guess I 'm in the right pew here , all right , all right . p. 47 HESTER I suppose you think I 'm  --  laughing in embarrassmentawfully foolish  --  like everybody else does . OSWALD Who does ? HESTER Oh  --  I do n't know . Do you ? OSWALD leaning over the table.You want to know what I think ? Well , I think you 're just about the sweetest little bit of ANDREW up-stairs.Hess ! Hess ! Where is that darned trunk ? HESTER blushing in embarrassment and pleasure , drops her eyes and smiles.I think you 're just the  --  biggest little jollier that  --  ANDREW calls again . I 'll come up , Andy , I 'll come up ! Willie Smart ! Oswald gives an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the arch , and drops with the air of a conqueror into a chair by the table. @x SCENE : The curtain rises on the sitting-room of the Lanes , lighted at the moment only by the scanty illumination from the electric light in the hallway . On the left the room opens into the dining-room ; on the right are a window curtained in cheap cretonne and a fireplace ; at the back , on the left , another archway opens into the little entrance-hall , whose stairway and hat-rack are plainly visible beyond the " chenille " hangings of the archway . The woodwork is spurious light oak , the wallpaper a faded semblance of dull-green burlap . There is a central electric chandelier , with pink porcelain candles , and there are also two side-brackets . The furniture and ornaments of the place are a mixture of pieces from old MRS . LANE 'S " front parlor , " transported thither from western New York after her husband 's death  --  black-walnut atrocities ; and some , of the 1890 variety , from HESTER 'S girlhood home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace ( a gas-log ) , and behind it is a large table , with a shaded lamp and books . An " ottoman " stands in front of the couch . At one side , to the right of the entrance to the dining-room , stands an old " secretary , " a combination of desk and bookcase . The well-worn furnishings , from the kindly action of time , a not untasteful arrangement , and an unpretentious attempt at mitigation of their crudities , somehow render the room neither unfriendly nor uncomfortable.It is about half past nine of a December evening , three months after Act I. The door-bell is heard violently ringing . MARTHE presently is seen running down the stairway , visible through the undrawn curtains of the archway . A VOICE is heard  --  that of a messenger delivering a telegram . VOICE Oswald Lane Cablegram ! p. 49 MARTHE For Mr. Oswald Lane ? VOICE Yes 'm cablegram . Sign here . There is a short pause , the outer door is heard to close , and presently MARTHE enters from the hall . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of the clock on the mantel , and then illuminates the room fully by lighting the chandelier and side-brackets . She stands there with the cablegram in her hand , looking at it reflectively . A pipe of OSWALD 'S at the table attracts her attention . She goes to it , picks it up , and presses it to her lips . She puts the pipe down and slips the cablegram into her pocket . She is evidently a prey to very disquieting thoughts . Suddenly she runs into the dining-room , calling to the dog , which she hears whining . MARTHE Cafard ! Cafard ! She returns with the dog in her arms . She dumps the dog onto the big footstool in front of the rocking-chair , and , slipping to the floor , buries her head in the dog 's coat , grateful for the animal 's passive sympathy . Oh ! Ma pauvre Cafard ! Ma pauvre Cafard ! Tu ne peux pas comprendre  --  que je suis malheureuse . The outer door slams . Quick steps are heard in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door with the dog , and thrusts her into the other room . OSWALD enters at the arch . MARTHE throws her arms about his neck , with endearing little French phrases. p. 50 MARTHE Ah ! Mon amour ! Mon p'tit chou ! OSWALD affecting good humor.Break away , Carpentier , break away ! Glances apprehensively toward the window . Look out , kid ! That shade 's not down , is it ? A little irritably . No . Say ! I might want to use my neck again some time  --  if they should ever want to hang me . Disengages himself , and gets out of his overcoat  --  the old horizon-blue of the French Army . Gives his kepi and coat to MARTHE to hang up for him in the hall . Gee-z  --  it 's a cold night , I 'll tell the world . Lights a cigarette . Despite his rather elaborate air of disinterestedness , his eye is sharply on MARTHE . Well , I been to the church and told ' em how I won the war  --  I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . MARTHE pulls him down into the centre of the stage , her face glowing with admiration . OSWALD is dressed in his poilu uniform  --  worn , ill fitting , blue . He wears it jauntily and has put on his medals  --  the French Croix-de-Guerre with palms , the Mdaille Militaire . On his left shoulder is the red cord  --  the fouragre  --  granted to Lgionnaires . There are four service stripes and two wounded stripes on his sleeves. p. 51 MARTHE Let me look at you ! Oh , you are so beautiful in your uniform ! My soldier ! OSWALD flattered and more expansive.Feels kinda good to get into the old duds again , Martie . You know , kid , I get kinda fed up sometimes with  --  with things here . All these damn rich  --  a fellow like me  --  what show 's he got ? They want to make him work for ' em  --  for the damn capitalists , that 's what . ' Tai n't fair ! I got 's good a right to be rich  --  better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of it ! Good 's those greasy hogs ! He crosses to the left . Divide up property , Martha , share and share alike , I say ! MARTHE follows him , takes his hand and clings to it passionately.Oswald  --  let us go away ! Take me away from here . I  --  I  --  hate it ! Take me to  --  I do n't care where . I 'll work for you  --  I 'll  --   --  OSWALD on his guard.Sure , kitten , sure ! Gim me time  --  gim me time ! MARTHE Your brother does not want me to stay here any longer . OSWALD suspiciously.Why do n't he ? How do you know ? MARTHE Your mother , too . She hates me ! She is afraid that I should make you with love for me ! I know ! I see ! p. 52 OSWALD Ma ! Oh , do n't let ma get your goat , Martie ! If ma ever felt real good about anything in the world , she 'd think she was sick and take something . Turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MARTHE mutely tries to understand him . I mean  --  what 'd you mean about him ? Wantin ' you to go ? Has  --  has he got on to anything , do you think ? MARTHE Oh , Oswald  --  can not we tell them now ? I do not like this always hiding and concealing . Let us tell them . Then we go and OSWALD impatiently interrupting.What about Andy ? Get down to brass tacks . Has he said ? MARTHE No . But I know . I feel . I see him look look  --  if we speak or sit together . Why does he do this ? OSWALD somewhat relived.You keep your shirt on , Marty . Old And ' has n't got anything on you  --  nor on me . He could n't see the hole in a doughnut  --  not if you took it out and gave it to him . But ' f you feel like this about it  --  why do n't you beat it ? MARTHE You mean go away ?

HESTER Andrew I wish you 'd never tell another one of those horried things as long as you live . OSWALD Every blamed one of ' em 's a dud ! SARAH re-enters and sits on the chair to the right of the arch . ANDREW very pleased with himself.You folks are jealous , that 's all  --  I was going to say , if Mattie was up , a cup of hot coffee would n't a-gone so bad , after winnin ' the war .

For four years I been bringin ' home the collection Sunday nights  --  pants ' buttons , dried wasps , brass pennies , and all  --  and nobody 's ever murdered me yet . Off stage and up the stairs are heard the voice of LITTLE ANDY and MARTHE . MARTHE is trying to catch the child as he runs down the stairs . ANDY is heard off the stage.Lemme go  --  I wan na see my uncle Oswald ! MARTHE Mauvais garon ! Come back ! SARAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHE . Look there ! LITTLE ANDY is in his night-clothes .

HESTER Darling ! You 'll catch cold . ANDREW grinning . ' Nother soldier in the family . OSWALD with the boy in his arms.Martie , get my overcoat ! These speeches all come together , but OSWALD 'S last remark dominates the others . MARTHE goes to the hall and fetches the military overcoat . SARAH disapprovingly.Why  --  Andy Lane ! OSWALD takes the overcoat from MARTHE and wraps the boy up in it.Looks just like Joffer ! Eh , marshal ? Say , son , you 've got your signals mixed . The attack was set for zero hour in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him up . ANDREW No . I will . ANDY No ! Uncle Oswal ' . You ! An ' I want my " Froggie " what Uncle Oswal ' gave me .

" Marchons Marchon-ons " OSWALD joins him , and they sing together . They march off centre and up the stairs . HESTER 'S satisfaction is very apparent. p. 67 ANDREW stands at centre and waves up the stairs.Bon sour ! Coming back . By golly , he 'll have me speakin ' French next ! HESTER How he loves Oswald ! ANDREW Eh-yah . To MARTHE , who is sitting at the right of the arch . Martha  --  what about a cup o ' hot coffee before everybody goes to bed ? MARTHE I go to make it , Mr. Lane . In five minutes it is ready . She crosses to the dining-room . ANDREW comes down and sits in the rocking-chair.Mattie do n't look very well , Hess  --  seems to me . HESTER Oh , I do n't know ! SARAH Now that MARTHE has vacated her favorite chair , she goes toward it . Sets in her room too much . Needs a good dose o ' Epsom salts , I guess . HESTER annoyed.Oh  --  mother ! SARAH She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Testily . Mercy on us ! Ca n't a body say anything ? I 'm going ' to bed . I do n't feel none too good myself , though I do n't suppose that matters none to anybody in this house . ' F that Marty 'd enjoyed the poor health I 've allus had , I guess she 'd look a good deal more pindlin ' than she does now . Resignedly . I hope none o ' you ever knows what it is to suffer with a floatin ' kidney ! She is about to go out through the arch. p. 68 ANDREW who has been rocking and whistling softly.Ma ! SARAH turning . What ? ANDREW Os made a hit with the boss to-night . He wants to give ' im a job , sellin ' insurance . HESTER sitting on the sofa.Oh ! How splendid ! SARAH coming down into the room.I ai n't s'prised . What 's he pay ? ANDREW rocking.Well  --  it 's a good chance , and prob'ly good pay to begin with . Hesitatingly . You know , Os @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HESTER But we 've been so glad to have him here . ANDREW Sure . That is n't the point , though . Os HESTER petulantly.But why do you talk as though we wanted to get rid of him ? You know the whole house has been a good deal brighter since he 's been here . SARAH With his jokes and all . HESTER And I do n't know what baby would do if he went away . And , anyhow , even if we did n't want him  --  which is n't true  --  it would be our duty to  --  to our country to see that a soldier that fought for us so splendidly was helped in every way . p. 69 ANDREW softly.Now , dearie  --  ai n't that just what we are doing , helping him ? HESTER hotly.Grudging ! ANDREW It ai n't gruding . Hess  --  you know  --  ma knows  --  that I do n't grudge him anything . But it 's awful hard sleddin ' to get along . I do n't know how we 're goin ' to come out clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two women are silent for a moment . ANDREW rocks and whistles softly to the tune of " There is a happy land  --   --  " I got the coal bill yesterday . Thoughtfully . Two or three things have come up that Os might have had , but he did n't seem to want ' em . He  --   --  SARAH sitting in her chair.He ai n't rill well . On the defense . Hester 's right in what she says . ANDREW And I do n't know as he 's actually tried very hard to get anything else . I guess he is kinda tired out , too . But we 're poor folks with a laugh as he tries to make a joke  --  and poor folks ai n't rich folks  --  you know . Again he whistles his tune . HESTER in a weary voice.Oh , I 'm so tired of being poor . p. 70 SARAH always ready to come to the defense of her own.They 's worse things . ANDREW cheerfully.Sure bein ' in a hospital . SARAH If it 's a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why that Marthy 's got to be kept here any longer ? ANDREW turns helplessly to HESTER . HESTER rising.She is going . ANDREW in astonishment.She is ? SARAH When ? HESTER Soon . She spoke to me yesterday about it . She wants to go . If she 's ready for it , then of course it 's the best thing . ANDREW Sure ! SARAH rising.If you ask me  --  that young lady 's mad ' cause Oswald 's come back oh , well  --  let ' er go . Good riddance to bad rubbish . Plaintively . Oswal ' ai n't going to be beholden to anybody , as I have to be . ANDREW soothingly.Well  --  ma  --  we wo n't worry . SARAH Land ! I like to forgot my tonic ! She leaves by the door at the right. p. 71 HESTER coming behind the table on the left.Oswald 's trying . I know he 's trying to get something to do . ANDREW Sure . I do n't say he is n't  --  but  --  darn it all , if I was a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and ready . Whistles a bar or two . I bought him a new suit yesterday . HESTER You did ? ANDREW You know , Hess  --  we 've got little Andy to think of . That money we 're puttin ' by for his college education do n't grow very fast . HESTER again going to the chair and sitting . Discouraged.Oh , dear ! Nothing seems right in this world . ANDREW turning in his chair so that he can look out to the hall and see if anybody is listening.What I was going to say was  --  Hess  --  that if you could sort of  --  you know  --  to Os . He likes you , and if you could maybe suggest that  --  ? This is a good offer of the boss 's  --   --  HESTER confidently.I know Oswald will take it . ANDREW Yes . I guess he will . Hess  --  Looking carefully out of the hall door . About Mattie 's going  --  Confidentially . There ai n't any  --  special reason for it  --  is there ? p. 72 HESTER looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakly.Oh  --  I do n't know  --  but  --   --  HESTER But what ? ANDREW worriedly.Well  --  Os  --  you know he 's always  --  sort of  --  joshin '  --  everybody  --  and  --  well , I did n't know but maybe he 'd been gettin ' fresh with Mattie  --  maybe HESTER on her feet , horrified.Why , Andrew Lane ! ANDREW I do n't suppose HESTER walking to and fro.I do n't know how you can even think such a thing ! ANDREW trying to get out thoughts that are difficult of expression.Well  --  when two young people get together  --  you see  --   --  HESTER I do n't believe a word of it ! Her jealousy is evident . ANDREW Well  --  Os is a likable fellow  --  and  --   --  HESTER Why  --  if anything , Martha actually rather dislikes him , I sometimes imagine . As she crosses the stage . Oh , no ! p. 73 ANDREW rises in relief , and crosses toward the fireplace.Well  --  that 's all right . I 'm glad to hear you think so . Whistles his hymn-tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , too . Would n't wonder if got his eye on Hilda Pierce , eh ? HESTER I do n't know . In a to know that Hilda is engaged to a ANDREW whistles . HE looks toward the stairs . Guess I 'll run up and have a look at baby . She starts for the stairs and meets OSWALD , who is coming down . She smiles brightly at him . Coming right back ! Exit up the stairs through the arch . OSWALD goes down to the couch , where he sits . ANDREW whistling.Guess I 'll go and see if Mattie needs any help . As he goes out the door he almost bumps into SARAH , who is entering with her medicine bottle in hand . Guess I 'll go and see if Mattie needs any help . SARAH first putting her bottle and spoon on the table.Oswal ' , I wisht you 'd sleep down here to-night . OSWALD Why ? p. 74 SARAH I 'd feel safer ' bout that money . Them burglars can git anywheres  --  church money , and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma . SARAH Oswal '  --  that Mr. Thornton has told Andrew he 'd give you a good job  --  sellin ' insurance . I want you should go right down to the city to-morrow and see ' im . OSWALD Me ? Sell insurance ? Nix ! SARAH You ca n't go on livin ' on Andrew 's shoulders . Andrew says he thinks you ai n't tried as hard as you might to git somethin ' to do . He says  --   --  OSWALD Oh ! He throws that up at me , does he ? ' Course I can go an ' fight so 's he can live at home on Easy Street ! Damn slacker ! That 's what they call " Keep the world safe for democracy ! " Well , you can tell him from me I ai n't going to trouble him much longer . SARAH What you goin ' to do ? Anxiously . You ai n't goin ' off again , traipsin ' around the world , be you ? OSWALD sulkily.I got plans . SARAH Oswal '  --  you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheedlingly . I want you should git to earnin ' . I guess I ai n't any too welcome in this house . Ossie  --  you take it , and we 'll git a little place to ourselves . Me and you . And I guess , if you wanted to , you could git that Pierce gal  --  from the flirty way she acted to-night , carryin ' on so about you  --  Ravellin ' on your sleeve . Sign o ' money ! She picks it off. p. 75 OSWALD to appease her.Money ?  --  Oh , well  --  I 'll see  --  do n't you fret , ma  --   --  SARAH piteously.Do n't seem 's if I could bear to have you run off again . I ai n't one to tell my feelin 's , but this bein ' away of yours has jest about killed me  --  ' F you should start off now  --  A sudden thought and she looks at him anxiously .

Crosses the stage angrily.Oh , between you  --  you and Andy  --  you 'd drive a fellow right into Sing Sing . Harp ! Harp ! Harp ! Every chance you get . Over a mistake I made once . Ca n't let it drop . Ca n't lemme forget . Oh  --  I 'm sick to death of the whole show . I wish I 'd never come home ! Sits in the rocking-chair . SARAH crosses to OSWALD . ' F you had any respect for my feelin 's , you would n't talk like that . Pretty way for a boy to talk , after all your pa and I and Andy have done for you . OSWALD Go on ! Rub it in ! Rub salt on the sores ! You 're having fun , ai n't you ? SARAH tearfully.I 'd cut my hand off for you , Ossie , and well you know it , ' f I thought it 'd do you any good . p. 76 OSWALD relenting . A little more kindly.Oh , well  --  I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night . I 'm worried  --  ' bout things . We 'll talk it over to-morrow . It 'll be all right . SARAH reassured.That 's a good boy . To ANDREW , as he enters with a tray from the dining-room . I told him . I guess he will , all right . ANDREW places the tray with cups and saucers on table.Good for you , Os ! SARAH I 'm goin ' to bed . I 'm about beat out . She picks up the last of her belongings . ANDREW crosses from the table to the secretary . Well , I hope we 'll all be alive in the mornin ' . OSWALD in the rocking-chair.You do n't ever worry or anything , do you , ma ? SARAH Land  --  what a day we 've had of it ! And me gittin ' up an ' goin ' to old Mrs. Trumble 's funeral tomorrow mornin ' . I like to forgot it . Andy ?

' Night , ma  --   --  OSWALD crossing , truculently.So  --  you do n't want me in your house any longer ? ANDREW Now , Os  --  I  --   --  OSWALD I s'pose you think because you put me under obligations to you once  --  you think you 've bought me  --  but  --   --  ANDREW coming toward him pacifically.Os  --  do n't talk that way . OSWALD By God  --  it makes me sick ! I ANDREW You know how we 're fixed here , Os . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do to OSWALD Well  --  lemme tell you one thing .

I dunno 's it makes much difference to me , ' s long as you freeze onto some job that 'll keep you busy and earn your living . ' Member that story ' bout the Irishman who  --   --  OSWALD interrupting angrily.Aw  --  you 'd drive a fellow nuts , you would . Why do n't you come right out and say what you mean  --  that you do n't want me here ? You 're like all the rest of ' em  --  fight for ' em , get wounded for ' em , croak for ' em , by God ! Save their old country for ' em , by God ! and then have ' em tell you to go to hell . No , sir ! Not any in mine ! p. 78 ANDREW becoming impatient.Say  --  what 's the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You talk like one of these here Bolsheviks . For the Lord 's sake , Os , keep off that stuff ! ' Two n't do you , or anybody else , any good . OSWALD It would make a man a Bolshevik just to listen to those rotten riddles of yours ! I do n't see how Hester stands it . ANDREW by the door , with an eye on it to see that HESTER is not about.You need n't worry about Hess . OSWALD with an open sneer.No  --  nor you . ANDREW regaining his good nature with an effort.Well  --  do n't let 's get to arguing , Os . Sunday night and all . I should n't wonder if what you 've done over there has kinda tired you out and put you on the blink physically . And you 've kinda lost your pep . That 's what the doctors say about a lot of the boys  --  All I wanted to say was that we all love havin ' you here with us , but seein ' as how Morgan forgot to  --  with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week  --   --  OSWALD ironically.Ha  --  ha ! p. 79 ANDREW Well  --  you know  --  Gets control of himself again and turns to OSWALD . Of course  --  now that Mattie 's going away  --   --  OSWALD off his guard.Who said she was going ? ANDREW quickly.Why ? OSWALD Nothing . Driving her out , too ? ANDREW Say  --  cut that out , will you ? She 's going because she wants to . Told Hess so to-day . OSWALD grunting.Oh ! ANDREW Say , Os  --  He comes down to the right of OSWALD anxiously . There ai n't anything  --  funny  --  between you and Mattie  --  is there ? OSWALD furiously.No , there ai n't ! ANDREW I would n't for ten thousand dollars have  --   --  OSWALD rises and crosses to the right.Is there any other damn thing you can throw up at me ? You 've done pretty well so far . Piker !

He goes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes anxiously down to OSWALD , who has reseated himself in the rocking-chair.What 's the matter ? ANDREW Oh  --  nothing . OSWALD Just jawing . Enter MARTHE from the dining-room . She has a large white-enamelled , steaming coffee-pot in her hand . She crosses to the table and places it there . ANDREW goes to the table . HESTER There 's the coffee . She goes to the table and pours the coffee , ANDREW helping her with sugar and cream . With a cup in her hand she starts to the right . Here , Oswald . MARTHE steps down a pace or two , and as though she were trying to help , takes the cup from her and hands it to OSWALD . HESTER looks at her curiously for a second , then goes to the table and hands a cup to ANDREW . Andrew , here is yours  --  do n't you want some , Martha , too ? MARTHE No , thank you . HESTER You look tired . You go to bed . I 'll clear up . MARTHE slowly and wearily.I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good night . p. 81 ANDREW sitting at the table.Good night . " Sleep tight . " MARTHE goes up the stairs . HESTER with her cup of coffee , going down to the couch.She is tired . ANDREW drinking his coffee.Hess  --  you do n't seem so very perky . I 've noticed it for about a month . OSWALD is drinking his coffee . HESTER I 'm all right , Andrew . Please do n't fuss . Drinking her coffee . ANDREW affectionately.Ca n't have my little honey-bird getting sick on me . HESTER impatiently.Do n't be silly . There is a long , awkward pause . OSWALD insolently.Say , And ' ! What 's the difference between a jackass and a lemon ? ANDREW thinking hard.A jackass and  --   --  OSWALD with a broad wink to HESTER . A lemon . ANDREW Why , I do n't know . p. 82 OSWALD I 'd hate to send you for lemons . ANDREW , as he realizes the insult , smiles a little hurt smile . There is an uncomfortable silence . ANDREW with an effort.That 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He chokes up and is unable to go on . Rises . Well  --  if your uncle Dudley is going to set sail for New Brunswick on that ten-thirty , it 's time to shove off . Ca n't afford to be the late Mr. Lane just yet . Goes up to the hall and gets into his things , talking to HESTER as he does so  --  coat , hat , rubbers , and umbrella . Hess , if I do n't get back the first thing in the morning , I want you to take that collection ' round to the bank and deposit it for me . See  --  dearie ? It 's quite a lot to have ' round loose . See ? HESTER busy with her own thoughts , indifferently.Yes  --  I see , I will . ANDREW Good . Well  --  I 'll be toddlin ' ' long , I guess . Kisses HESTER . ' Night , dear . ' Night , Ossie  --  think over that job , wo n't you ? OSWALD does not answer , but stares straight out in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be mad , Os  --  As he gets no response he stands there awkwardly for a moment , lonely , unwanted in his own home . ' Night . He goes out and the outside door closes . There is a pause . HESTER sets her coffee-cup on the table behind her. p. 83 OSWALD You better go to bed . I 'm going to sleep down here . HESTER What for ? OSWALD Ma . Got to watch-dog the damn money . He nods toward the secretary . HESTER On the couch ? OSWALD nods affirmatively . HESTER rises and comes toward OSWALD . Diffidently . What was it ? OSWALD What was what ? HESTER Between you and Andrew . Just now ? When I came in ? OSWALD Oh  --  nothing . HESTER I wish you 'd feel that you  --  could  --  tell me things  --  She takes his cup . Like you would a sister ? Why do n't you ? OSWALD does not reply , nor does he look toward her . She sighs , and goes over to the table , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sleep down here ? Really ? OSWALD Uh-hum . HESTER You 'll be cold . I 'll bring you some blankets and a pillow . OSWALD laconically.Do n't want ' em . HESTER You 'll be cold . p. 84 OSWALD There 's a cover there . I 'll put my overcoat over me . HESTER by the arch.Sha n't I turn out these lights ? Without waiting for a reply she presses the button at the left of the arch and puts out the brackets and the chandelier . The only light left burning now is the lamp on the table . OSWALD Do n't fuss . HESTER near him , after a painful silence.Oswald ! OSWALD Huh ? HESTER You  --  you are n't offended with me ? About anything  --  are you ? OSWALD Me ? Nope ! HESTER You 'll be cold without a blanket . Crosses . OSWALD I been colder . HESTER sitting on the couch.Oh ! Suddenly bursts into tears . OSWALD You 're tired out . You better go to bed . HESTER hysterically.Go to bed ! Get up ! Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I 'm sick of it ! Sick of it ! OSWALD goes behind the table and puts the cups on the tray . HESTER makes an attempt to pull herself together ; rises . Do n't do that . I 'll do it ! I  --  I  --  do n't know what 's the matter with me to-night . OSWALD crosses to the fireplace . I wish you 'd let me get you a blanket . p. 85 OSWALD not unkindly . Pushing her down on the couch.You sit down there . HESTER whimpering.I 'm cold . OSWALD by the window.You better go to bed . HESTER on the couch.Light the grate , will you , Oswald ? I do n't care if we ca n't afford it . OSWALD All right . OSWALD gets a match , strikes it , then sitting down on the low bench before the fireplace , he lights the gas-log . His back is to HESTER . HESTER looking toward him.It 's made  --  all the difference having you here with us . OSWALD abruptly.I 'm going away . HESTER Go going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . HESTER I suppose  --  you are sick of us . OSWALD You did n't expect to keep me here always under a glass case  --  stuffed ? Or anything like that , did you ? p. 86 HESTER But you 've only just come . OSWALD And ' do n't seem to feel like that . HESTER fiercely.What has Andrew been saying to you ? OSWALD What difference does that make ? HESTER Oh he has he has ! I 'll never forgive him . Oh  --  he had no right to ! His own brother  --  a soldier  --  what was it he said ? OSWALD does n't answer . Tell me ! You must ! OSWALD crosses to the back and then to centre of the stage.Oh ,  --  I do n't know . Handed me a little bokay or two  --  about being a yellow dog , and a cheap-skate , and a chippy-chaser  --  and one thing and another . HESTER horrified.Oswald ! Oh ! Tries to control herself , but the tears will come . You  --  you must be mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could n't have . Why  --  it is n't like him  --  why  --   --  OSWALD See here , sis . What 's the good of all this ? You do n't want to get hot under the collar against And ' . I know you take this war-stuff pretty seriously and all that . I wish to God there was more women like you . I know how you feel . But you just better forget all about it . I 'm going away . You 'll settle down to your home life with And ' . You 'll forget me ! You 'll see . p. 87 HESTER her face hard and set.I 'll never forgive him . Never ! Never ! OSWALD with a laugh.Never 's some time . HESTER after a long pause.Are you going to take that place Mr. Thornton ? OSWALD I 'll tell the world I 'm not . HESTER But , Oswald  --  do n't you think  --   --  ? OSWALD mimicking.But , Oswald  --   --  HESTER swallows a sob . OSWALD comes over to her . Poor old sis ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact , she pushes him away hysterically.Do n't ! OSWALD strolling down , carelessly humming.All right , excuse me . HESTER rising and following him. I do n't know what 's the the matter with me to-night . OSWALD turns to her and smiles , over his shoulder . I I They are both in the centre of the stage. p. 88 OSWALD facing her.Well anyhow , we 're buddies , eh ? HESTER taking his hand in hers . She lays her cheek against it. Oh ! poor hand all scarred fighting  --  for us . OSWALD , with a half-pitying smile , disengages himself . OSWALD to create a diversion.Gosh ! Rip in my coatsleeve ! Looking at the left sleeve of his coat . HESTER I 'll mend it . I I 'd love to ! In a proprietary manner . Oswald  --  take your coat right off now  --  mind ! OSWALD submits to her ; she helps him take off the coat.You 're a good little sis . HESTER , now that she has a definite service to perform , smiles happily . She fetches her work-basket from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HESTER I love to do things for you  --  do n't you like me to ? OSWALD seated on the couch.I 'll say so . HESTER now sitting facing OSWALD with her back to the audience sewing on the sleeve of the coat . The red glow from the fireplace takes in the two of them . Sentimentally.Just think of the stories this old coat could tell , if it could talk . p. 89 OSWALD grinning.I 'm thinking . HESTER probing for information.Did n't anybody do anything nice for you  --  over there ? OSWALD Sure . I asked a Y. M. C. A. guy for a shot of hootch once and he gim me a Bible . He was a kind guy . HESTER You 're always joking me . I mean  --  women  --  were n't there any especially nice to you ?  --  After you got out of the hospital ? OSWALD seems lost in memories at this question . HESTER is insistent . Were n't there ? OSWALD Eh ? Oh Women ! Oh , they 's women enough everywhere . Too many of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't it nice  --  being here so warm and comfy ? Do you know it is the first time we have been really alone ?  --  Tell me more about the war . I love to hear about it , and you boys that have really done things wo n't ever talk OSWALD stretching himself out at ease on the couch , after a silence.So warm and comfy . Sometimes , over there , when I 'd maybe be sittin ' up to my waist in ice-water and just cussin ' out the whole damn show  --  I 'd think of places , warm and comfy . I never had ' em  --  but I 've seen ' em  --  and heard about ' em  --  like this . HESTER , in sympathy , reaches out her hand to touch his . Carelessly , and as though by accident , he moves his hand in time to avoid her outreaching one . I 'm a poor lot , Hester , I guess . I 've hoboed it , and dead-beat it all over the darned place . Ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of everything  --  women and men  --  and God 's made some birds , I 'll say . I 've gone down the line with ' em . Greasers in Mexico , chinks in Shanghai , wops in Naples , niggers in Port Said  --  Oh , God , I do know . Everything . Every damn thing  --  If they 'd been a kid like you waitin ' for me  --  maybe Then comes the war . I goes in along with a guy named Bill , that I picked up over in Chili  --  a Swede . We gets in the Foreign Legion . God , what a swell bunch !  --  Gee ! Old Bill was a card . He got his , all right . Falls down in the attack , right by me ! " Come on , Bill ! " I says , " to hell with ' em ! "  --  " I got mine ! " he says , and he had . I could n't stop to do anything . I never saw Bill again . He sits up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medals on his coat. p. 90 HESTER reverently.War cross and two palms ! OSWALD For what I done that day . HESTER Taking that dreadful machine-gun ! OSWALD And bringing six Fritzies back by the tails. And the next day I gets mine . Resentfully . Only I do n't die. Bum foot . He raises his foot in the built-up shoe and lets it down with a thud . After a short pause he rises ; HESTER rises , too , and helps him on with his coat . She slips down to the couch , and as she sits there she lays her cheek against his left arm . OSWALD regards her , half in pity and half in amusement . He seems to be working out some plan in his mind . He frowns , his eyes wander to the secretary , speculatively . HESTER All you 've seen and done . And all I have n't . It does n't seem fair , somehow . OSWALD at the head of the couch.You mean you 're fed up , sis ? HESTER I ca n't explain you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life is wrong , I guess . Bitterly . Oh , what does it all matter ? OSWALD sitting beside her . Trying her out.Suppose just for instance  --  suppose I told you that I was fed up  --  you understand what I mean  --  and wanted some place , warm and comfy , as you say , and somebody who 'd help make it so . Somebody who 'd want me there . Some one who 'd understand me , and stick to me  --  through hell . My kind o ' girl . Every fellow 's got his kind , you know . Suppose I said I 'd been homesick for her , just plain nutty  --  till I got right where I 'd got to have her by me  --  for keeps . Had to ! Dotty about her .  --  Suppose I said all that , Hester ? What would you say , sis ? So great is HESTER 'S emotion that she can not reply . OSWALD eyes her with a certain amusement , a certain contempt . He rises and crosses to the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . p. 91 HESTER Oswald ! Piteously , after a pause . Do n't go  --   --  OSWALD after a pause , in a cold , matter-of-fact voice.No . I ai n't your kind , sis  --  do you get me ? Looks at the clock on the mantel and then crosses to it . Gee ! It 's ' most eleven o'clock . What do you know about that ? At the fireplace . You 're all tired out . All in . You 'll feel better in the morning . He watches HESTER cynically for a moment as she sits huddled up on the couch , trying to comprehend where she is being swept . At last he comes behind her and speaks . Hess  --  lemme give you a tip . You stick to your kid  --  he 's hero enough for you . HESTER , utterly at sea , hesitates miserably , seeing her poor little dream shattered to bits . At last she rises and without a backward glance drags herself hopelessly out of the room and up-stairs . OSWALD coolly watches her go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she disappears he laughs shortly . He fetches his overcoat from the hall and standing there with it in his hand he thinks for a moment . Then he drops the overcoat on the chair , goes down to the couch and pulls the afghan up so that it covers the couch . He looks at the couch in resentment . He picks up the overcoat and brings it down and lays it over the foot of the couch . Now , standing in front of the couch , he takes the cablegram from his pocket , and by the light on the table behind him he reads the cablegram over with satisfaction . As he finishes he mutters : " You betcha I will ! " He crosses to the secretary and puts on the little desk-light . He sits at the secretary . Pulling a sheet of paper toward him , he begins to write  --  apparently in answer to the cablegram . He pauses and falls into thought . His pen taps the desk mechanically as he debates the question within himself as to whether or not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His eyes fix the drawer , and furtively his hand reaches out toward the drawer and tries it . It is locked . He looks at the other drawer where he knows the key is placed . Suddenly he conquers the temptation . He crosses decisively to the couch ; lifts his coat as though to lay it down under it . Again temptation assails him . He hesitates , thinks , then yields . With a quick step he is at the hallway . He looks out to see if the coast is clear . It is . He goes quickly down and extinguishes the lamp at the table . With an unfaltering step he goes to the secretary , takes the key from the upper drawer and opens the lower one . He takes out the bag of money and crowds it into his left coat-pocket . HESTER , in her night-dress and wrapper , with a blanket over her arm and a candle lighted in her left hand , enters at the arch from the stairs in time to see him steal the money . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her causes OSWALD to turn . The two stare at one another for a moment of silence . MARTHE runs down the stairs and into the room . Her eyes are on HESTER with furious accusation . Her gaze travels to OSWALD for explanation . With a mutter of rage OSWALD rises and , pushing between the two women , goes up-stairs to his room . MARTHE regards HESTER with loathing and anger for a moment and then with a little cry of " OSWALD ! " she follows him up the stairs . HESTER stands petrified with horror and anguish . The blanket falls from her nerveless arm as she looks straight in front of her and@@ SCENE : Same as Act II.The following morning.HESTER is still in her night-dress and wrapper , though she has placed over her shoulders the afghan which was on the couch . Cold with shame and fear , she is discovered at the bottom of the stairway watching . She has been up all night , waiting for OSWALD to appear . She comes into the room . As she does so the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and lifts the shade . The morning sun streams in.Hearing a step , on the stair , she nervously turns toward it . It is MARTHE , who enters . Her disordered hair , red eyes , and distraught countenance betray only too well the fact that she too has spent a sleepless night in tears and anguish . She gives HESTER a look of fierce contempt , and without speaking goes toward the dining-room . HESTER Have you seen him ? There is no answer . Have you spoken to him ? MARTHE sullenly nods a negative . He 's still in his room , is n't he ? He must n't leave this house . He must n't . She crosses to the left . MARTHE Half way to the dining-room door , she turns with an hysterical outburst of passion . Why you come here last night ? Why you stay here so ? You are ashamed to tell me. p. 94 HESTER What is it to you , anyway  --  what I do  --  or what he does ? What 's he to you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love him ! You hear ? And he loves me . Me !  --  not you ! HESTER Has he told you that ? MARTHE triumphantly.Yes , madame ! HESTER crossing.So  --  you are the one ? " His kind of girl . " Laughs a dry , crackling laugh . You do n't see anything funny about that  --  do you ? It 's funny . Almost as funny as one of Andrew 's riddles . Turns to the girl . So you are his  --  sweetheart ? MARTHE still triumphant , but bewildered.Yes , madame ! HESTER He 's your  --  your  --  ? Oh , you need n't keep anything back . ' Tis n't worth while  --  Is he ? MARTHE defiantly but a little frightened.Oui ! But he will marry me . He will take me away . HESTER Oh , so that 's it , is it ? Well  --  it does n't matter  --  now  --  When did you talk to him last ? MARTHE sullenly.Last night , before you came back . p. 95 HESTER And  --  he said then he 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't he marry you here ? MARTHE does not answer . What for ? Goes to her and turns the girl so that she has to look into HESTER 's eyes . In utter disgust . Oh ! it 's that is it ? You fool ! MARTHE recklessly.I am proud proud proud of it . HESTER with an eye on the arch.Do n't scream so ! MARTHE You hate me because I am happy ! HESTER You  --  happy ? Oh , Martha ! MARTHE Yes yes yes ! HESTER This is a happy house . MARTHE sobs hysterically . Stop crying ! HESTER shakes MARTHE by the shoulders . Stop ! HESTER 's force dominates the girl and makes her stop crying . HESTER speaks in a cold , precise voice . I do n't care what he does  --  or what you do . He can take you wherever he pleases  --  the sooner the better . After I 've seen him . Do you understand ? Listen to me . Are you listening ? I want you to tell me everything you know about last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talk . And talk ! Down-stairs . I wait for you to come up You take off your dress  --  you go down  --  to him  --  Losing control of herself . Oh ! Madame ! You shall not take him from me ! HESTER Oh  --  stop that ridiculous stuff . There 's no good going on like that . I want to know what you two intend doing with that money . MARTHE all at sea.Money ? HESTER Who planned it ? You or he ? He did , I suppose  --  Did n't it mean anything to you that you 'd had a home here ? Kindness ? Friendship ? Care ? You could calmly plot together , right under this roof ? Knowing what it would mean to us ? After having sunk as low as you could with him  --  you could plan that ! MARTHE Mon Dieu ! Plan what ? HESTER That ! Pointing toward the secretary . You know what he was going to do . That 's why you came down . Less convincingly . You have said very wicked things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to do so . You ran away from me last night . You would n't let me explain . I came down here last night to see if he had enough covers on his couch  --  it was cold  --  he was going to sleep here on account of the money  --  it 's true ! As MARTHE sneers . When I got to that door  --  he was  --  I saw him  --  stealing that church money from the drawer ! p. 97 MARTHE dismayed.No ! No ! To herself . Oh ! Mon amour ! Tu as fait a pour moi ! HESTER Stop talking French !  --  You wicked girl . I want you to understand one thing clearly ! Neither you nor he is going to leave this house till every cent of this money is  --  MARTHE on her knees before HESTER.Madame ! Clutching the little cross that she wears about her neck . I swear to you  --  as God is my witness , I did not know anything of this  --  believe me  --  not anything . It is for me that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not bad . No ! No ! You shall not hurt him . You shall not . SARAH from up-stairs , calling.Hester ! HESTER puzzled.You did n't know  --  you ? MARTHE Non ! Non ! Non ! SARAH from up-stairs.Hester ! Hester ! You there  --  Hester ? HESTER sharply.Ssh ! She 's coming . I must get my clothes on . Whatever the truth of this thing is , he must n't leave this house with that money . He sha n't ! It would be awful for us . For everybody . Ca n't you see ? The war  --  and Little Andy  --  and everything ? You must n't let him go till I get back ! She grips MARTHE by the arm . You promise ? p. 98 MARTHE Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! They separate as SARAH enters from the stairs and hall . She is dressed in a black-and-white cotton skirt and wears a gray flannel bed-jacket . She is carrying her best skirt and waist , her hat and her coat and her " false front . " She crosses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage . SARAH turns and sees her . SARAH My Lord above , Hester ! What in the name o ' mercy you doin ' down here in your night-dress ? HESTER trying to control herself.I just ran down to look for something that I left here . I SARAH severely.You 'll catch your death o ' cold . Get right up-stairs and put on your dress . You look like death and destruction . Sees MARTHE , who is leaning against the arch looking toward the stairs . Both of ye ! What 's the matter ? HESTER It 's dreadfully cold. Martha 's got a headache . SARAH Huh ! If she 'd a had my newralagy ! I never slep ' a wink till five o'clock this mornin ' ! That 's why I overslept . HESTER at the arch.We all did . As SARAH 's back is turned she gives MARTHE a warning look and then goes up the stairs . SARAH arranges the garments she has brought down , puts the afghan back in place and smooths it down. p. 99 SARAH working as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch at the arch.Yes . SARAH Hum ! You got the fire started ? MARTHE Not yet . SARAH carrying OSWALD 's overcoat , which was on the couch , to the chair.Well , I never ! What you standin ' there for , like a graven image ? Ai n't you never heard that folks eat breakfast ? Git a move on ye , Marthy ! MARTHE her eyes on the stairs.My head hurts me . SARAH Huh ! Yer head ! Looking at the couch , her mind on something else . Did n't Oswal ' sleep down here last night ? MARTHE I do n't know . SARAH exasperated.I du n no what 's come over everybody this mornin ' . You all act ' bout 's lively 's a cigarstore Indian . Yer " I 'd know this " and " I 'd know that " ! I s'pose you expect me to git the breakfast . ' Course it 's nothin ' to nobody that I 'm going to ol ' Mrs. Trumble 's funeral this mornin ' . She is straightening out the pillows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intendin ' to git there early so 's I could see what they laid her out in . I heard ' t was a white satin shroud . The undertaker told me yesterday at meetin ' that she 'd begun to mortify and that was why they was a-hurryin ' to bury her . She wa' n't much to look at when she was livin ' an ' , now if she 's a mortifyin ' ! Mercy ! Them Trumbles is tighter'n bark to a birch-tree . I bet you the coffin-handles is nickelplated . She goes to the table and gets the coffee-tray , left there from last night . Come right along now , Marty , and help git the coffee . Somethin ' hot 'll do ye good . Come on now . Starts for the dining-room . I would n't a  --  overslep ' to-day for nothin ' . She goes into the dining-room . MARTHE hesitates , but seeing HESTER coming down the stairs she follows SARAH into the kitchen. p. 100 HESTER enters from the arch . She has made the hastiest toilet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room to rights . From time to time she supplicates aloud . Oh , God ! Please help me !  --  Oh , God ! Please please help me ! ANDY calling down the stairs.Mummy ! Mummy ! I 'm up ! HESTER Yes , dear . Martha 'll come and help you get dressed . ANDY from up-stairs.Uncle Oswal 's up too ! He sings as he comes down the stairs , the little French song that MARTHE has taught him : " Au clair de la lune , " etc . Jumps down the stairs two at a time to the bottom and enters . HESTER in terror , as she thinks of OSWALD.Oh ! ANDY runs to the secretary , where he leaves his " Froggie " that he has brought with him.Uncle Oswal ' buttoned me. Now you be a good froggie  --  you 'll get your breakfast pretty soon . Crosses . Calls . Uncle Oswal ' ! Uncle Oswal ' ! Come on down , I 'm down-stairs . OSWALD from up-stairs.All right , general . p. 101 HESTER on couch as ANDY runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She clasps him tightly in her arms . ANDY disengaging himself. Oh , mummy ! You tickle ! Ca n't I have breakfast ? I 'll be late for school . HESTER In a minute , dear . ANDY as OSWALD enters calmly from the stairs , neatly dressed in a new brown suit . ' Tai n't ready yet . OSWALD nonchalantly seats himself in the rocking-chair . OSWALD Ai n't it ? Well , you and me we 'll have to play we 're in the trenches , waiting for the gazabo that brings the juice in the coffee-pail , eh ? ANDY What 's juice ? OSWALD French for coffee . ANDY climbing on OSWALD 's lap.It is awfully nice havin ' you here with us , Uncle Oswal ' . OSWALD Is it ? ANDY Awful . You wo n't never go away  --  will you ? OSWALD Not if you say so . ANDY We do n't want him to go ever , do we , mummy ? Louder as HESTER does not answer . Mummy ? Do we ? p. 102 HESTER Perhaps he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd stay  --  did n't you , uncle ? OSWALD Um-hum . HESTER stares at him dumfounded . SARAH entering from the dining-room.It 's ' bout ready . Come , Andy an ' eat yer orange  --  it 's gettin ' late . To OSWALD . Hungry 's a bear , ai n't ye , Oswal ' ? As she starts for the dining-room the telephone rings . Telephone 's ringin ' . Again she starts for the dining-room . Telephone rings again . She turns and sees that neither of them has moved to answer the bell . Ai n't you goin ' to  --  ? Another ring . She goes to the hall as she speaks . Land ! Have I got to answer that awful thing ? At the telephone in the hall . Oh Andy , is that you ?  --  You are ?  --  At the station ? Before long ? All right . Coming back into the room . Andrew 's back . He 'll be here pretty soon , I guess . He says if the boss calls him up to say he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining-room . Little Andy can walk along to the school with me , Hester , as long as I 'm goin ' by there on my way to the funeral . p. 103 HESTER dully.All right , mother , if you wish  --   --  ANDY from the dining-room.Mummy ! Come here a minute ! I want you ! HESTER Yes , dear , I 'm coming . She looks at OSWALD for a second , and then goes quickly into the dining-room . SARAH I had a cup of coffee in the kitchen . She crosses to the mantel and begins to get ready for the funeral . She is thus occupied during the following scene . Slipping off her wrapper , she dresses rapidly , pins on her " false front , " and adjusts her hat . Them stairs ' bout kill me , what with my roomatism and all , so I brought my dress right down here. Mattie 's got your breakfast ' bout ready . She ai n't no worker , that girl . I pity the man who gits her. You goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe . SARAH looking in the mirror on the mantel as she adjusts her garments.Well  --  you better .

Andy ! Come right along ! Git yer things on !

What do you care about it ? HESTER What do I care ? Why  --  it 's terrible ! It 's awful ! It 's criminal ! We 'll be ruined . The disgrace of it to the family ! Give it back . Now . This instant .

OSWALD insolently.Go to it , Phbe Snow . You 're doing fine . You 're all right ! You 're pure ! God but you 're pure ! But it 's going to cost you money to pay your laundry bill , my little snowflake . But lemme tell you one thing your dope on Martie is all wrong .

You think I do n't know ? You have n't got anything on me , young lady . HESTER Oh  --  you coward ! You coward ! OSWALD Oh , can that stuff ! ' Tis n't going to help you any . Listen to me . HESTER distractedly.Have n't you any pity ? OSWALD Listen here . You tried to find out last night if there was any other woman . You know why you wanted to know . And then I handed you that " supposing " stuff . Supposing you were the goat ? And you were , all right . God , you were easy ! When I first came here I thought you were  --  well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a good girl  --  married , with one of the finest kids a woman ever had .

HESTER on her feet.I do n't care what happens ! What you do ! I wo n't let you take that money . OSWALD What 'll you do ? Call the police ? And disgrace the family ? What about your nice , pious friends when they hear the police have arrested the church treasurer 's brother ? HESTER , realizing the force of his argument , sinks back again . Why , you have n't got the nerve to do it ! And you know it ! That money 's going to take me back to France . HESTER Oh ! Oh ! And Martha ! Martha  --  what about her ? What are you going to do about her ? As she is ? OSWALD casually.Martha ? Oh  --  nothing . Leave her , for you and Andy . HESTER again starting to her feet . In horror.Do you mean to say you 're going to leave her  --  like that ? Leave her like that ? OSWALD regretfully.I 've got to . Poor kiddie ! I 've got to . You can help her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God ! Oh , my God ! OSWALD Well  --  I 've told you . You asked for it and you 've got it . I 'm going .

For your mother 's sake  --  for Little Andy  --  for Martha ! OSWALD You were n't thinking of them last night  --  Cut that sob-stuff out . I 've got to go . You understand ? Got to ! Goes out into the hallway and gets the suitcase which he brought down with him earlier . Appears in the doorway with hat and coat . Think over what I 've said , sis . You 're up against it . You ca n't do one damn thing but take your medicine . HESTER beaten and hopeless.You coward ! Sinks down on the couch , back to audience , facing the arch where he is standing . You coward ! OSWALD Say  --  give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The outer door slams . MARTHE entering at the dining-room door . Agitatedly.What is it ? I hear you talk  --  talk  --  talk ! What have you said to him ? Calls as she goes through the arch , runs up the stairway and back . Oswald !  --  Where is he ? p. 111 HESTER in a dead voice.He 's  --  gone . MARTHE anxiously.Gone where ? HESTER He 's got the money . He 's gone ! MARTHE Oh ! Oh ! Madame ! Earnestly , pathetically honest . He must not do this . I shall not let him do this . He does not know what he does . He is foolish  --  frightened  --  because I am  --  do n't you see ?  --  as I am . When I have seen him , I shall make him understand . Have no fear of that . She smiles confidently , patronizingly . HESTER realizing the terrible blow she must deal to MARTHE.You  --  you poor girl ! MARTHE I must go to him . Tell me where he is ? HESTER Martha , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as brave as you can . He  --  he 's  --  it 's not what you think . He  --  Martha  --  he 's not coming back any more . He  --  he MARTHE Where is he ? HESTER as gently as she can.He took the money because  --  he took it to run away with  --  away from you , all of us . He has left you . p. 112 MARTHE That is not true ! HESTER If it only were n't ! MARTHE It is not true ! HESTER It 's true enough , Martha . He 's going to  --  another woman  --  a girl  --  in France . That 's why he stole it . To get him there . He said so. Not you  --  nor me . Her ! He 's left you to me ! MARTHE You ! He threw you away ! That is why you tell me this . You lie ! In the distance a heavy deep-toned fire-bell begins to toll with a suggestion of desolation and menace . HESTER realizing the hopelessness of attempting to convince her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Then you 'll know ! She cries and goes up to the window . MARTHE If he goes  --  I go ! Good or bad I go with him  --  out of your horrible house  --  forever ! ANDREW who has just opened the street door as MARTHA collides with him in the hall.Where you goin ' ? What is it ? Mattie The hall door slams . She darn near knocked me down ! At the arch , calling up the stairs . Hello , everybody ! Hoo , hoo !  --  I 'm home . Comes into the room , sees HESTER , still by the window . Hello , Hess ! Where the dickens is Mattie goin ' on the hundred-yard dash ? p. 113 HESTER Oh  --  I do n't know . She saw somebody . ANDREW taking off his coat.Saw somebody ! Gosh ! She made me see stars , all right . Must-a seen her best beau go by. Gee ! It 's a cold mornin ' . I nearly froze at the station . The house is cold , too . The bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard the engines as I come along . Big smoke , too . Takes the coat to the hall , taking out of the pocket a parcel . Here 's ma 's tonic . Places the package on the table . Stopped into Simpson 's drug-store for it as I came along on my way up from the station . Saw Os running by . I hollered at him , but he did n't pay any attention . Wonder if he 's still mad at me ! Breakfast ready ? I 's hungry as a dog . Say , Hess , a feller on the train told me a daisy conundrum  --  about " Why do n't the devil skate  --   --  " HESTER her nerves racked to the breaking point.Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Or I 'll scream the house down . Stop ! She crosses down to the couch . ANDREW mildly disturbed.What 's the matter , dear ? HESTER I  --  I do n't know  --  I do n't feel well , I  --   --  p. 114 ANDREW You do look about all in . Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know how this house 'd get along without you . Whistles for a second  --  " There is a happy land . " The answer to that one is  --  Oh ! Oh ! I forgot . Did n't want to hear that one , did you ? He goes to the secretary and puts some papers in it . HESTER all the while is watching him in deadly fear that he is going to open the drawer and discover the loss of the money . Funny thing . Os got the notion in his head last night that I thought he was spongin ' on us . Ruminatively . Funny kid , Os  --  gettin ' into scrapes since the day he was born , and getting out of ' em by the skin of his teeth . But he ai n't bad , Hess  --  he 's head-strong  --  gets an idea into his nut and  --  Shakes his head dubiously . You know I would n't have him think we did n't want him here , not for a thousand dollars . HESTER resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes toward her. What , dear ? HESTER unable to go on.Nothing . ANDREW looking at her closely.Say ! You look awful , Hess ! Maybe it 's the flu . Want a doctor ? p. 115 HESTER No . ANDREW You 're all tired out . You 're tied down here too close . Wish I could take you on a little vacation . Niagara Falls or somewhere . But we 're so darn poor and all  --  He has started toward the secretary . Suddenly he turns . Did you see him ? HESTER started.Who ? ANDREW Os . This mornin ' ? She nods . What 'd he say ? She does not answer . How was he ? Did you talk to him ? What 'd he say ? HESTER unable to hold out any longer.He he ANDREW Huh ? HESTER He  --  he  --  Oh ! I guess I 'll go up and lie down . She is near collapse . ANDREW coming toward her , solicitously.I guess you better had . HESTER weakly.Andrew  --  oh , Andrew ! Be good to me . ANDREW Why  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll carry you up-stairs. p. 116 HESTER as he attempts to take her in his arms.No . Please ! ANDREW I want to . HESTER holds him at arm 's length . Well  --  I  --  all right . A fire-engine is heard in the street close by . Where 's ma ? Another engine-bell clangs . HESTER The funeral . ANDREW as the engines pass the house.Hello ! Goes to the window and looks out . HESTER crosses and sits by the secretary . Look at the folks runnin ' by ! Mattie 'll get her death of cold without anything on her . Guess I 'll go to that fire when I take that money over to the bank . He crosses back to the secretary . HESTER is now in the chair before the drawer in which the money was left . ANDREW takes the key out of the upper drawer and starts to unlock the lower drawer . HESTER in horror as she realizes that this is the end , that discovery must come.Andrew ! I I She tries to arrest his hand . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man 's voice is heard calling. p. 117 VOICE Lane ! Lane ! ANDREW turning.What ? VOICE off stage.For God 's sake , quick ! You 're wanted ! Quick ! ANDREW startled.Why  --  what 's the matter ? I  --  He runs out of the room toward the outer door . The door opens and one hears a murmur of excited voices . The words predominating in the conversation are " Your brother ! " " Do n't get excited , Lane ! " " Fire ! " HESTER , unhearing , relieved at anything that could stop the immediate discovery of the theft , lets her head drop helplessly on the desk . Suddenly there is a cry from ANDREW in the hall and the sound of a door slamming . Presently MARTHE enters at the hall door from the left . Her face is ghastly and gray with horror . She comes in , as though in a trance . She covers her face with her hands as though to shut out some dreadful sight . MARTHE Oh ! HESTER hearing MARTHE . Presently she rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHE staring straight out in front of her.He he is dead ! p. 118 HESTER Dead ? Who ? MARTHE her tearless grief choking her words.He he  --   --  HESTER He ?  --  Who ?  --  Not ? MARTHA nods . Oh what what ? MARTHE The fire  --   --  HESTER Fire ? MARTHE The  --  the kindergarten  --  the  --   --  HESTER dazed for a moment.Fire ! Kindergarten ! Screams . Baby ! She staggers out of the room and the outer door slams . MARTHE like a frightened little child.I 'm afraid ! I want my mother ! I want  --  my mother . Voices are heard in the hall . A door is heard to open and close . MARTHE , unable to endure what she supposes to be the sight of OSWALD 'S dead body , exits moaning , " OSWALD ! " ANDREW in the hall.He ai n't hurt , Hess , he ai n't hurt ! HESTER in the hall.Oh , baby , baby ! ANDREW and HESTER enter , the former carrying LITTLE ANDY wrapped in OSWALD 'S coat , which shows great holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HESTER sits on the couch and ANDREW puts the child in her arms. p. 119 ANDY I ai n't hurted , mummy  --  not a bit . Uncle Oswal ' come and got me . He found me . The fire got ev'rywhere , and Uncle Oswal ' come . Where 's Uncle Oswal ' ? HESTER turns her eyes to her husband questioningly . He breaks into a sob.Tell me . ANDREW He 's gone . HESTER Tell me . ANDREW I do ' know . The kindergarten . Andy lit a camp-fire , he says , and it was all afire in no time , they say . Andy was missing and Oswald run in and got him . And then Oswald run back again , after another little boy , that 's what they say  --  and the roof fell in on ' em . Oh , God  --  it 's awful ! Burned to death ! That 's his overcoat there on baby . And he 's gone . And I was here a-talking and making jokes . It 's awful . HESTER a look of awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank God ! ANDY getting out from the coat and down from his mother 's lap . Why do n't Uncle Oswal ' come home ? Goes to his father and pulls at his hand . What you cryin ' for , daddy ? Where 's Uncle Oswal ' ? ANDREW to spare the boy the scene.Listen , Andy . There 's that little dog whining for you in the kitchen . p. 120 ANDY pulling away from his father.Lemme go . Cafard ! Cafard ! He runs to the dining-room door , where one hears him singing " Au clair de la lune , " his troubles soon forgotten . ANDREW looking after the boy.The little fellow do n't sense what he 's done . He sits beside HESTER . Oh  --  I ca n't bear it , Hess . If Os had only parted friends with me. Why , I would n't a-hurt him any mor'n I 'd hurt Little Andy . He was just a kid to me  --  Os was . I could n't help but forgive him for the things he 'd do . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I HESTER mechanically.Do n't . You must n't , Andrew . You must n't feel that way . ANDREW Everybody loved Os . Andy , you , Martha , everybody . But he  --  he thought I was hard on him  --  he died  --  thinking  --   --  HESTER gently , out of her own deep pain.Andrew  --  listen , dear . Do n't abuse yourself like that  --  you were good to him . Wonderful  --  I  --  I  --  Oh , Andrew  --  Andrew , if I 'd only been  --  as good as you . ANDREW Did n't he say anything  --  this morning  --  when he went  --  about me ? p. 121 HESTER determining to lie bravely to him to ease his pain.He said : " Tell Andy  --  I 'm sorry  --  about last night . He 's  --  a good old scout . " ANDREW smiling through his tears.He said  --  that ? Why  --  that means everything . You do n't know what that means to me , Hess . Sobs again , but softly now . " Good old scout ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I knew he was all right . Bless him for that . HESTER Andrew  --  poor Andrew ! Pause . Andrew , God 'll forgive our mistakes , wo n't he ? ANDREW puts his arm about her and holds her to him . Andrew  --  there is something else  --  something  --  She draws away from him . ANDREW vaguely . " Good old scout , " he said. Turning to her . What is it you say , dearie ? HESTER making a great decision . With faltering voice.Andrew , that money  --  the collection  --  the money you  --   --  ANDREW as she hesitates.Yes ? HESTER I gave it  --  to Oswald  --  to put it in the bank . p. 122 ANDREW vaguely.Now ? This morning ? HESTER Just now . ANDREW slowly , scarcely comprehending.Then it 's gone . It 's burned . With him . HESTER He took it  --  to put it in the bank . ANDREW sighs heavily , then squares himself to meet the blow . ANDREW Then we 'll have to make it up . That 's all . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll have to pay it . Oh , Andy , if you knew ANDREW ' Tai n't your fault , Hester . Do n't you worry . Natural enough for you to give it to him to put in the bank for you . Do n't fret , honey , ' bout that . HESTER in a sudden break.Oh , Andy  --  Andy ! Why did n't I understand ? ANDREW Sh !  --  It 's all right . He sighs heavily , wearily . Seems sometimes as though everything hits you all in a heap. We 'll get out of it somehow. I 'm so darn sorry for you , Hess . I know how you miss all the nice things that other girls have  --   --  HESTER Andrew ! Do n't ! p. 123 ANDREW Well , it 's true  --  an ' I do n't blame you . He sits thinking for a moment . Maybe I can borrow a little money somewhere . And there 's that money we been savin ' for Little Andy 's education . HESTER sighs bitterly . Yes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HESTER I do n't mind , Andrew . I 'll help you . Oh , Andy  --  I 'm so  --  so sorry . ANDREW drawing her closer and patting her hand.Why , of course . There does n't anything matter much , dear , so long as I got you and the boy . Thank God for that !  --  Now I must go an ' find ma . Poor ma ! And then  --  go back there to  --  him  --   --  HESTER looking into his eyes with a new love born of her suffering and shame.You are a good man , Andrew ! Now I know ! A good , good man . ANDREW humbly and simply taking her into his arms .
