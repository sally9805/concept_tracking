Henry H. Timken , president of Timken Roller Bearing Co. , Canton , Ohio , began to spend virtually a million dollars last week so that Dr. Orval James Cunningham of Kansas City , Mo. , might study and test his treatment of certain cases of diabetes , pernicious anemia and cancer by putting the patients in tanks filled with air under pressure . Mr. Timken has spent $165,000 for a ten-acre plot of land on the Lake Erie shore at Cleveland 's eastern limits and , last week , had agents apply for a building permit to construct the first steel tank , to be 64 feet in diameter and the equivalent of five stories high . Inside will be airtight chambers to contain compressed air , like the treatment tank that Dr. Cunningham has had operating in Kansas City for eight years . <P> Dr. Cunningham , aged 47 , is a graduate ( 1904 ) of Rush Medical College , Chicago ; a Kansas City specialist in internal medicine ; a member of the Associated Anesthetists of the U. S. and Canada ; a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Association . <P> His theory is that certain forms of diabetes , pernicious anemia and cancer are caused by germs that can grow only in the " absence of free oxygen . The corollary of this theory is that if the body tissues are made to absorb and carry enough air , the oxygen will prevent such germs developing . So Dr. Cunningham puts his patients into shut rooms where air pressure of 10 to 50 pounds a square inch more than ordinary is maintained and keeps them there for from a few hours to a month . Some patients merely spend their nights in the tank treatment rooms ; others live and sleep in them . The rooms resemble , except for their fine appointments , the air locks used in excavating tunnels . <P> Of Dr. Cunningham 's theories , the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association ( directed by Dr. Arthur J. Cramp ) has stated : " There is not the slightest scientific evidence to support the thesis on which the Cunningham treatment rests . As independent investigators have never checked up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous expense of the apparatus ) there is nothing to support Dr. Cunningham 's statements or theories except his own unsupported word ... It is our personal belief that Dr. Cunningham , at any rate at the outset , was perfectly sincere and honest in his belief that he had stumbled on something . As is always the case , however , when some new method of treating human beings is carried out without any independent check or balances , there seems little doubt that Dr. Cunningham has allowed his subject to run away with him . " <P> None the less , Manufacturer Henry H. Timken has been willing to spend a million dollars to give a full test to the doctor 's theories . This is no whim of Mr. Timken who is well known in Canton for his secret philanthropies , especially for supplying medical aid to indigents.
