A Lost Lady . When the heavens fall and the eruption of eternity smothers the world , this department will probably be still protesting peevishly that straight character study can not be reflected in the camera lens . For it is the words that come out of a man 's mouth that define him , more exactly than all his grimaces and gestures . Willa Cather 's A Lost Lady was a character study if ever one was written . The book had no further plot nor purpose . It told of a lovely , intense young woman who married an old and impoverished aristocrat of a small Middle West town . It showed how utterly impossible became her life ; it told what she did about it . All this the picture does , and only half the heroine comes to life . Despite an exceptionally adroit performance by Irene Rich , the film is feeble . <P> Broken Laws .

The producer helped himself to Eugene O'Brien , Ben Alexander , Mae Busch and several other expensive luxuries in casting this picture . The investment seems to have been sound . Without their able acting , the old Western story would have wabbled . It tells of an open-spaces girl married to a creaky drunkard from the East , how he gambled away his character and her fortune and how the burly , silent hero suddenly stepped in from the side lines . The genuine and inventive talents of Miss Busch , in particular , were highly helpful . <P> The Redeeming Sin . The cutting edge of Nazimova 's personality is far too sharp for such crumbly material as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good heart after all ( cf. Kiki ) . Lou Tellegen , as the Apache , and a lot of fairly well faked Paris scenery are also thrown away .
