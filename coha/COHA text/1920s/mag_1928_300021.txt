More and more turbulent grew Philadelphia 's liquor ring investigation ( TIME , Sept. 17 ) . The city 's bootleggers , finding the local distilling plants padlocked were not downhearted . They ordered shipments of alcohol from Porto Rico via New York . These goods were seized , however . <P> Mayor Mackey of Philadelphia clutched the rostrum of the Arch Street Methodist Episcopal Church and begged Evangelist " Billy " Sunday to conduct " a great campaign in this city as an antidote to the bootlegger , hijacker and gunman . " Mr. Sunday , responding , said the proposition was attractive . <P> Federal Agents . To the railroad station went newsmen , photographers , city officials . They met an incoming train . On board was George E. ( " Hardboiled " ) Golding , " ace " of the Federal Prohibition Bureau , and eight assistants . Big , bespectacled Mr. Golding and his staff had recently combatted Chicago beer-runners with their own methods of shooting and blackjacking . This bravura policy is said to have caused Mr. Golding 's removal . Previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he secured 112 indictments . The Golding fame rests largely on the Golding flair for secrecy . But never did soft shoe men indulge in such a brouhaha of publicity as did Mr. Golding in Philadelphia . He issued detailed announcements . He had his sleuths grouped and photographed at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel . It was obvious that Mr. Golding wanted to give Philadelphia 's ' leggers an even break . People said it was because Philadelphia is Republican and too many discoveries there might be embarrassing to Mr. Golding 's superior , Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , Assistant Attorney General . As everyone knows , Mrs. Willebrandt is a Hooverizer of almost reckless intensity . <P> Bigwigs . Before their own Grand Jury the Federals began by reviewing the case of one Joel D. Kerper , " society bootlegger , " whose headquarters were raided on July 20 . The examination of ' Legger Kerper 's records disclosed the names of many famed Philadelphians , presumably bigwigs who had dickered with him . Among these were : D. B. Cummins Catherwood , banker ; Gardner Cassat , banker &; broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxwell R. Marston , onetime ( 1923 ) national amateur golf champion ; Major Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle , author , lecturer , explorer , founder of the " Athletic Christianity " movement . Subpoenas were scattered far and wide . <P> Alfred E. Norris , Manhattan stockbroker , was indicted on a charge of conspiracy with ' Legger Kerper , who was alleged to have sent some 15 shipments of liquor to the broker 's apartment . Special Assistant Attorney General Davis hoped to set a precedent for prosecuting buyers as well as vendors . He did not , however , neglect ' Legger Kerper , who was indicted on 33 counts .
