Petrushka , a ballet about a silly , tragic rag doll with a soul , by Igor Stravinsky , was revived last week , at the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan . There was only one Russian in the cast . He , Adolph Bolm , took the part of the sawdust Caliban , capered foolishly , pathetically , to his special tune- a fanfare for two trumpets a minor second apart . Rosina Galli was the limber ballerina . At the end of the performance , Mr. Stravinsky was discovered to be present , hailed before the curtain , presented with an overstuffed floral wreath , according to Metropolitan tradition .
