The wise do not know everything . Samuel Johnson , able lexicographer , once ejaculated : " Sir , a woman 's preaching is like a dog 's walking on his hind legs . It is not done well ; but you are surprised to find it done at all ! " Yet Mrs. Mary Harris Jones- " Mother " Jones-attended the Farmer-Labor Convention in Chicago ( see page 5 ) and made a speech that , if surprising in a woman of her age , could hardly be described as poorly done . <P> What made the speech " surprising ' was that such coherence , such sense and such spirit should come from the lips of a woman of 93- for Mary Harris was born in Ireland in 1830 . She was taken to Canada at the age of seven , was educated there , and later went to the South and worked in the cotton mills . There she fought child labor . There she married and had four children . There husband and children were swept away by yellow fever . <P> Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Labor , yet claimed by the Socialists , full of sweetness in times of labor peace , a very Amazon in action , she has had a part in nearly every important strike in the last ten years . <P> Hear the clear words she spoke in Chicago : " You must organize and use your heads . You have been letting bosses override you too long . You must clear out the crooked labor leaders among yourselves . <P> " All you need to do is to unite politically and you can have a thorough cleanup . You will be able to clean out the gunmen in the coal fields , particularly in West Virginia . It is time to get back to the spirit of the Revolutionary fathers ! "
