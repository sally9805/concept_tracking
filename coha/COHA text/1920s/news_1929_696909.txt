txt More than one hundred men and women who reported " on the set " at the Paths Manhattan . Film Studio , Park Avenue and 134th Street , yesterday morning to take . part in the recording of a gay song and dance revue , found themselves cast instead in a tragedy in Which , ten of their number were killed and . : eighteen were injured . They were victims of a fii  --  c which swept the interioi ; b4rrilike old structure with.death-dealing rapidity , cutting or. * " a14arief .. frdlit. all but one exit and ' *tiatlisforinOlik ' the bantering , laughing company in grease paint and work clothes into a fighting , stampeding horde who by their own actions doomed themselves . None of the three official agencies investigating the fire  --  the District Attorney 's office , the police and the Fire Marshal 's office  --  was able to fix the cause definitely . Some witnesses said a glowing carbon which fell from an arc light near the ceiling ignited a velvet drop . Others thought a carelessly tossed match or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still others  --  although electricians denied it was possible  --  believed a short circuit was Zo blame . Believes Some Deaths Needless . Whatever its cause , according to Fire Chief John Kenlon , the fire results might not have been so disastrous had an order for the installation of a sprinkler system , issued by the Fire Department last May , been obeyed .. The sprinklers would have held the flames back long enough to cover the escape of many of those who died , Chief Kenlon believed . Chief Peter C. Spence of the Fire Prevention Bureau said later , however , that the installation was not obligatory unless more than five reels of film were kept in the studio . Once the fire ; started everything seemed to go wrong . Instead of stepping outside to a fire alarm box at the door , Bernard Mahony , an assistant director , told the men in the studio to try to put out the flames with fire extinguishers while he ran upstairs to warn the chorus girls in their dressing rooms . " Get out , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls , accustomed to a director 's joking , thought it was just a ruse to get them to hurry , for it was almost time to " go on " : e set . " They took their time about getting out and in the few precious minutes some of them lost their only chance . Meanwhile , the men who had been left to fight the flames licking up the huge black velvet curtain had pulled it down , and when that was done the fire , which had been feeding on the painted scenery it shielded , burst forth and spread throughout the studio , hung with drapes to deaden sound . Girls Stampede on Stairway . It was just at the moment when the dawdling girls , some in gauzy ballet dresses , some in scantier costume , stepped from their dressing rooms on the balcony overlooking the main studio from the 134th Street side . They stampeded for the main stairway , tumbling one over another and bowling over would-be rescuers coming up the stairs . Deputy Fire Chief Thomas Dougherty , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score of men and women at the bottom of those stairs , some squirming and fighting among themselves , some of them quite still and all of them in the centre of the blaze . " Get some water on . them , " he yelled , and firemen , - dashing in at the peril of their lives , began to bring out the dead and injured . Among the dead there were several with broken wrists , ankles and fingers . Few of the  --  victims were badly burned and Dr. Harry Archer , Fire Department surgeon , said most of them died from inhaling smoke and flame in their mad scramble to escape . The blaze had gained such headway by the time the first , fire appargtumarrived th t Captain John M. Rahilly. of Engine 17 , the tint to reach the scene , at once sounded ' a second , third and fourth alarm , bringing nearly all the engines from the Bronx and many of those from Upper Manhattan . Two fireboats responded to the call , but could not reach the fire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals of the New York Central tracks across an open plaza 200 feet wide so that engineers had to creep past the spot . Although the building seemingly was provided with ample facilities for escape a freak of the fire rendered all but the main stairway useless . The blazing scene box at the rear of the studio shooting flames across the balconies made escape impossible by either of the two steel stairways leading to a courtyard from the rear of the building . Two other stairways on the south side of the building could not be reached by the girls in the dressing rooms on the north balcony and one man who tried to scramble down them found it was safer to jump than to risk running through the flames which were shooting from windows across the stairway . Those who escaped formed a bizarre group shivering in stage make-up and scanty costumes on the wind-swept street . Some of the girls fell to their knees to pray for the safety of friends inside . Across the front of the building a huge sign proclaimed ironically in letters two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laugh . " Eddie Elkins , leader of the twentypiece orchestra , which was tuning up when the fire started , strode about in tattered dinner clothes clutching his violin under his arm and bemoaning the loss of his bow . Three comedians , Harry , Cy Wills and Bob Carney , sat lugubriously on the curbstone costumed , respectively , as Paul Revere , Jesse James and a Roman Senator . Finally the whole motley troupe found shelter in the office of the Crane Company , manufacturers of plumbing fixtures , across the street . For a long time the bodies lay under a tarpaulin on the sidewalk , half a block away from the fire . All were taken to the morgue at Bellevue Hospital to await identification , which was made doubly difficult by the fact that what clothing the victims wore had been burned off . William Ward , mortuary superintendent at Bellevue Hospital , said he had not seen such scenes of tragic desolation since the Times Square subway wreck a year ago last Summer as he witnessed when friends and relatives hastened there yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank . The story of the disaster is not entirely one of panic and stampede . There were instances of self-sacrifice and heroism as well . Some survivors told breath-taking stories of escape . Lieutenant Daniel Shea and Fireman Charles Roche of Engine Company 36 saw a girl lying halfway up the stairway . From the doorway through the smoke and fire they could see that she was alive though obviously unable to help herself . Dousing themselves with water they fought their way to her side and bore her to the street . The girl was Edna Burford , who died late in the afternoon in Harlem Hospital . One needless effort at rescue cost the life of Joseph Bishoff , a makeup man , who , not knowing that his friend , Mrs. Anna Blier , a wardrobe mistress , had escaped by jumping through a window on the first floor , ran in to get her out , only to be trapped himself . John C. Flinn , vice president of the Pattie Film Company , which leases the studio from its owners for the production of short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office on the southeast corner of the mezzanine . With him were his secretary , Margaret Walsh , and Norman Bauer , controller of the company . Bauer stuffed the money he was counting into a safe and then fought his way out in some manner that even he does not remember . Flinn climbed out on a narrow ledge around his office window and then lifted Miss Walsh through the window after him . There they clung , with flames licking about their heels , for fifteen minutes until firemen saw the woman 's blue smock through the smoke and ran a ladder up to them . Wills , the comedian , who has been a suitor of Jola Sparks . 16-year-old dancing girl , who was killed , tried to fight his way up the stairway to her dressing room , but was borne down by the crushing mob and forced to crawl out of the building without her . Ruth Goodwin , a niece of the late Nat Goodwin , was playing one of the feminine leads in the cabaret comedy . She had arrived on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire started . She reached the street without difficulty . Crawls Through Coal Chute . Fritz Dose , 63-year-old janitor of the building , who is slightly lame , heard a commotion on the floor above and poked his head out of the cellar just in time to see the velvet curtain come down and release the flames behind it . Quickly he slammed the door and retreated to his cellar , where he thought he would be safe . Soon the water began to rise , and , though safe from the flames , Dose was in danger of drowning . He got out by crawling through a coal chute . Firemen were looking for his body in the cellar when he appeared and identified himself , though still in a daze from his experience . He lives at 227 East 124th Street . Carl Edouarde , former musical director of the Strand Theatre orchestra , who now writes musical scores for the talkies , saved his life by an acrobatic stunt but broke his leg in a six foot drop to a pile of lumber . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balcony across the studio from the dressing rooms watching a picture which two operators were running off for him . He stepped out into a mass of flame , learning for the first time that the building was ablaze . How the two operators got out , he does not know . Somehow he made his way to a fire escape . Flames shooting from windows prevented descent of the stairs . Nearly six feet ahead of him and at a slightly lower , level than his feet , he noticed a brace running from the building to a big signboard . Standing on the railing of the fire escape balcony . he I jumped . His hands grasped the bar and he hung on somehow , although he weighs 210 pounds . He had sprained his shoulder in the jump and he had to let go a moment later . He dropped into a pile of lumber . His I left leg was broken but he crawled to the street and safety . Inflammable Material on Stage . The studio where the fire occurred is an old brick building with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet on 134th Street . It is two stories high . Along both sides are balconies , leaving the centre clear to the roof . At the back of this open space , known technically as the stage , was the " scene box , " shielded from view by the velvet drop , a curtain 25 feet by 20 . In it are stored the settings not in use , highly inflammable papier-mache , smeared with even more inflammable paint . It was there that the fire started . It was 9:30 A. M. Eddie Elkins 's band was tuning up . Half a dozen show girls in costume were on the floor limbering up their legs and stifling yawns . From the dressing rooms came laughter , shrill voices and the noise of high-heeled slippers dropping to the floor . Carl A. Kramer and Charles Koerble , electricians , whose bodies later were taken from the ruins , moved lights to and fro . Robert . Nussman , another who lost his life , ran hither and yon at the call of " props . " Supervising it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast of dancers , singers and jokesters from such Broadway successes as " The Little Show " and " Sons o ' Guns . " The four chorus girls who were killed . Catherine Porter , Norine Byrne , Miss Burford and Miss Sparks , were among the most versatile before the footlights , it was said . The comedy for which they had been gathered was " The Black and White Revue. " a singing and dancing ' fantasy of life in a night club in Harlem . For two weeks the piece had been in rehearsal . The cameras had " shot " some of the sets . Yesterday it was hoped to finish it and the cast had been told they might have to stay quite late . Delmar looked at his watch . Five minutes to go . He was about to send word to the girls to hurry , Richard Stradling , head electrician , 472 Hawthorne Street , Yonkers , was standing on the balcony focusing a spotlight on the raised platform in the centre of the stage where the action of the comedy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several angles at once . Only one of the giant sungiow arc lights was on . It sputtered . Stradling looked up , and as he did so he noticed one of the carbons hurtling downward . Still hot and glowing it struck the floor near a corner of the velvet curtain , he said last night at Harlem Hospital , where he lay , his head and body swathed in bandages . " Get that , " he shouted . Helped Some Girls to Escape . But before anything could be done a rose glow showed on the ceiling above the scene box , and Stradling said he knew it was too late to stop the fire 's spread . He jumped from his platform to the balcony and helped some or the girls to the top of the stairs . After that he did not know what happened , he said . This version of the start of the fire was corroborated partly by Stanley Vinal of 249 West Forty-ninth Street , another electrician who is in Harlem Hospital with severe burns about the head and body . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , he saw a little spot of flame near the bottom of the great black curtain . Lyal Bowen , a saxophone player , coming downstairs " on call , " said he first noticed the fire at the bottom of the velvet drop . Ernest Flisser and Charles Corbel , camera man , seized hose lines at the first cry of fire , but before Flisser could turn the valve , Corbell , at the nozzle , was knocked down by the stampeding throng on the stairs . Flisser scrambled after his friend . He found him unconscious at the bottom of the stairs , his body almost on top of Stradling 's , who also had been knocked out . Flisser struggled out of the building dragging both men . C. J. Scollard , treasurer of Pathe Sound Studios , Inc. , said at the offices of the company in West Ferrtyfifth Street that thr company 's investigation had failed to disclose the cause of the disaster . " We regret very much its occurrence , " he said , " and our chief concern is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The loss of the films and other properties will not be considered until we have first ascertained the extent of human losses . " Mr. Flinn , the vice president , who was rescued by firemen , said he was anxious to correct an impression which many persons seemed to have that film had exploded and set the building afire . Only a small quantity of film sufficient for the needs of the picture in the making is kept in the studio at any time , he said , and that is stored in a fireproof vault in the rear of the building . A thorough inspection was made two weeks ago by fire underwriters who reported that all regulations and requirements had been complied with , he asserted .
