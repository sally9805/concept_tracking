COMMONWEALTH <P> ( British Commonwealth of Nations ) <P> Nothing could have been more simple , more dignified and more sane than certain speeches that Mrs. Philip Snowden , wife of the onetime Chancellor of the Exchequer , made a fortnight ago in Montreal . She told crowded houses all about the Labor movement in Britain . She explained the uphill fight of the pre-Labor Government period , the inner frictions of the Labor Cabinet and what is now being done . <P> She made two unusually interesting statements . <P> The first was a pleasing reference to the British Royal Family which , in Canada , and Montreal not least of all , is reviewed with more general and genuine affection than it is in Britain . Mrs. Snowden declared that the sympathetic attitude of British Royalty to the Labor Ministers and officials had established forever the " English Throne in the hearts of the English people . " <P> The second statement was a criticism of ex-Premier Ramsay MacDonald 's leadership . Mrs. Snowden inferred that it had been bad ; she actually said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . Unfortunately , coming from the wife of the ex-Chancellor who was notoriously out of sorts with his Chief , such a statement provoked much criticism . <P> From London , The Morning Post , relentless enemy of ex-Premier MacDonald , immediately put the capital created by Mrs. Snowden at interest by writing an editorial : <P> " The incorruptible member of the Labor Party ( Philip Snowden ) , to do him justice , always played the game with his chief . Even when Mr. MacDonald was prepared to raid the treasury for the most unmitigated scoundrels who ever disgraced civilization , Mr. Snowden bowed his head , and if he cursed at all , he cursed under his breath . <P> " Mr. Snowden may have been foolish , but he was silent . Mrs. Snowden certainly is not foolish , and she is far from silent . <P> " Is Mr. Snowden going to round up the lady who , besides being his own wife , stands deservedly high in the counsels of Labor , or is he going to throw over Mr. MacDonald as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Post hoped that Mr. Snowden would stand by his wife , " particularly as he knows she is speaking the truth . " <P> From another part of London , politically opposite to the great Strand newspaper , came a girlish outburst of indignation from Labor 's only woman M. P. , Ellen Wilkinson . She said that the women of the Labor Party " felt pretty sick when they read nonsense like that talked by Ethel Snowden in America and added that she would like to apply to Mrs. Snowden the epithet " The woman who wants slapping . " <P> Angry at the attack on Mr. MacDonald , she became metaphorically livid over the tribute her elder sister , Mrs. Snowden , paid to the House of Windsor . Fumed she : <P> " If Mrs. Snowden has lost her head because the King happened to have said ' How do you do ? ' to her , there is still a mass of devoted women in this country determined that the Labor Party shall stand for the ending of all that show and theatrical glitter and tinsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
