On March 4 President Harding completed the first two years of his Administration , which was the signal for many dignified and somewhat rhetorical eulogies from his friends and a few bitter denunciations from his political enemies . <P> In arguing the case for and against Harding , both sides had recourse to the record of his achievements and failures instead of to the personality of the man and the theoretical conception of the Chief Executive . Here Harding 's enemies were bound to have the best of it in point of fact and prediction , for it is always easier to fix the responsibility for failure upon a President than to prove him to be the author and main spring of great works and noble aspirations . <P> When Mr. Simeon Fess , ex-Chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee , attempts to portray the President as a lawgiver and executive of the blood and stature of Lincoln , public opinion is at once skeptical and on the defense . When , on the other hand , The New York World , or Mr. Joseph T. Robinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase like " the creature of a Senatorial oligarchy , " or call him the " synthetic automaton of a few reactionary political doctors who met secretly in a room in the Blackstone Hotel in 1920 , " public prejudice and the mob 's love of sensational and derogatory slander is kindled into a livid and cynical flame . <P> But Harding should not be pleaded for nor abused on the precarious ground of his achievements . He is not a superman like Roosevelt or Wilson ; he never pretended to be , and he should not be judged according to such lofty standards . He is important and successful as the embodiment of the American idea of humility exalted by homely virtues into the highest eminence . He is the actuality of the schoolboy notion that anybody has a chance to be President . <P> Mr. Harding has no personal enemies . Almost everybody in Washington likes him and admits he is a " good fellow . " And to be a " good fellow , " handshaker and amiable " regular guy " and still occupy the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest American idealism . No one realizes this more completely and shrewdly than Harding . Let the " best minds " advise him ; let the Marionettes be treated as real neighbors when they come to Washington ; let the regimentation of American opinion on sound economics , good citizenship and patriotism receive his full approval in the most hearty and homely fashion-it all redounds to the vitality of the legend he is busily fashioning , that of a man who will not let high office and vast honors go to his head .
