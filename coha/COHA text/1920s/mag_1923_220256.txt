The legislative council of the National Education Association in conference at Cleveland was addressed by United States Commissioner of Education Tigert in favor of the creation of a " Department of Education and Welfare " in the National Government , rather than a " Department of Education " only-as provided in the Towner-Sterling Bill . Commissioner Tigert stated that he appeared with " the consent and approval " of the President . He reminded the council that President Harding 's father " is still practicing medicine , " that " his only brother is a leading physician , " that his sister " was a missionary with medical leanings . " Nevertheless , the council voted to stand solidly behind the Towner-Sterling Bill . <P> This decision has met with popular approval . Although the " Department of Education " of the Towner-Sterling Bill is subject to unlimited attack from the point of view of constitutional law , constitutional policy , administrative efficiency , and the national debt ; everything that can be said against that project can be said against the joint department . The public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities of the National Government , homes , hospitals , and social service institutions now scattered under several different authorities , all would be combined . <P> The 10,000 teachers assembled at Cleveland were emphatic in their demand for an exclusive Department of Education . They intend to launch a nation-wide campaign to arouse public sentiment , and it is asserted that the Department will eventually come into being . <P> The general argument for a Department of Education at Washington is that the National Government should not neglect a business of such vital importance to the nation . Such a Department , it is said , will not interfere with local institutions except to advise and give useful information . At the same time it can be of immense service in fighting national illiteracy and helping the immigrant . <P> But opposition to any such department is bitter . The gist of the attack runs : " The whole plan for national control of education in any degree whatever , to the exclusion of local control , is vicious . It means another department , another set of insulating bureaucrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ' unAmerican ' has still a certain meaning , in spite of Mr. Babbitt and his journalistic friends . It describes a point of view out of all harmony with the basic principles of the National Government . And in that sense of the word this entire attempt to place in the Administration at Washington control over the immediate concerns of the several states is ' un-American . ' " <P> Says Dr. Samuel P. Capen , chancellor of the University of Buffalo : " The strength of American education lies chiefly in its diversity , its flexibility , and its freedom . The schools of Nevada , for example , have never been and should never be like the schools of Massachusetts . "
