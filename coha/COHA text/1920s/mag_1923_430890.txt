Fine fur is commercially in the same class as fine jewels . From time beyond memory , furs have ranked with jewels as the badge of royalty . The ermines of coronation robes in Europe have their counterpart in the Turkish red kolinskies of the sultans , or the sables and martens of Chinese mandarins . Do you know why fine fur fascinates us so ? Because there is a fur for every face . Be the face old or young , fair or dark , gold hair or black as ebony , there is a fur to frame that face and bring out its lines of beauty and hide its defects and soften its harshness ; and the search for that fur , which stands both for use and beauty , is the oldest vocation of mankind dating back to cave life . It represents the first manufacture by man . It was the lure of fur that drew wandering tribes in far migrations , and later tempted discoverers across unknown seas to find unknown worlds . It is true that practically every section of North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or political liberty . But it is also true that , with no trade , no cleared land to raise food and clothing , those seekers after freedom could not have existed a year , much less have discovered , explored , and secured a continent , without coin to pay their way . And the coin that paid the way was neither wampum nor metal .  | It was the pelt of the little brown beaeer . The pelt of the little beaver was the lure that led voyagers up the Ottawa to the Great Lakes in the search for the Western Sea ; and from the Great Lakes overland by canoe and portage to the Sea of the North ; and from the Great Lakes again across by canoe and portage to the Mississippi and down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico ; and up the Saskatchewan ; and up the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains ; and down the Mackenzie to the Arctic ; and down the Columbia to the Pacific ; and across the height of land between the Columbia and the Colorado over all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states of the Union . No matter how loyal Champlain and Marquette and Joliet and La Salle were to the glory of creating a New France in a New World ; no matter how zealous were Radisson and Groseilliers , the two free-lance explorers , to the high empire of finding new nations between the Great Lakes and the Missouri , and the Great Lakes and the Hudson Bay ; no matter how ambitious to write their names on the scrolls of fame were La Verandrye and Mackenzie and Fraser and Thompson ? without the little beaver to pay for the follow-up of exploration that preceded settlement their high aims would have collapsed for lack of support from the impoverished exchequers of European monarchs . It was the little beaver that paid the way and lured them to the pot of gold at the rainbow end ; and of all the fur companies to exploit the wealth of the wilderness ? " Company of the North , " " Company of the Indies , " " NorWest Company , " " Pacific Company , " " Astorians , " Missouri merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a bigger business in furs than in the heyday of its glory , when its traders ruled as lords of the north , emperors of a wilderness , from the Atlantic to the Pacific , from the Sacramento to the Arctic ; and that is the " Gentleman Adventurers of the Ancient and Honorable Hudson 's Bay Company , " chartered by the grace of God and royal favor of Charles II , in the year of our Lord 1670 . It hardly needs telling that the Hudson 's Bay Company* no longer wields a monopoly that excludes rival traders . Nor does its dominion extend to California , as it did from 1821 to 1836 . Colonization has shorn it of half its old hunting ground ; but its hunting ground is still three thousand miles from east to west and fifteen hundred miles from north to south ; and that is larger  | than all the central nations of Europe with part of Russia thrown in ; and though furs have been hunted in this territory since 1668 , the business is bigger to-day than ever . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of society wear furs to-day , whereas , a hundred years ago , furs , like pearls , were the badge of nobility or wealth . In the second place , while fur values have fluctuated violently for four years , furs still bring higher prices by a thousandfold in some cases than they did twenty years ago , or a hundred years ago . Take mink , for instance ! I have seen the finest mink sell at eighty cents a skin . I have seen mink of not so good quality in modern days sell at seventy dollars for the same sized skin . Or take muskrat , black-brown , prime , and in season . It used to go begging at fifteen cents a skin . The same skin would to-day command from five to seven dollars . In the old days , rabbits were considered worthless except for the food of the dog trains ; but there came new processes of treating rabbit , and in one year , in a single sale , as many as twelve million rabbit skins have been sold . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trader relentless to rivals and a close buyer in barter from the Indian hunters , it has always done two things : ( 1 ) it has aimed to preserve animal life ; ( 2 ) it has always in bad seasons carried its Indian hunters over on credit with ammunition and provisions . How could it be a preserver of animal life and yet a trader in furs ? The answer is simple : Fashion shifts . The vogue is fox one year , beaver the next , and otter the next ; or else the craze runs to little furs ? ermines , martens , minks . As the vogue shifted , the company put prices low for the furs out of fashion and discouraged the Indians going after those furs , so those animals could multiply . It also taught the Indians not to kill fur-bearing animals in summer , when the fur sheds ; not to kill the mother and the young , and not to cause bush-fires , which destroy more animal life than trap or gun . And with its fur trading the company has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of diplomacy , of finesse , and of the gentleman 's standard . In the days  | when I was a child in Winnipeg , and Fort Garry still stood behind the old gate , which is all that remains to-day of the ancient fur fort , you could , of a winter afternoon , see the dog trains coming in up the ice of Red River from Lake Winnipeg and Norway House , or across country from Fort Pitt and Fort Carlton and the Saskatchewan ? huskies hitched tandem to toboggans on which were lashed the bales of furs , the driver running abreast on snowshoes with a long whip , yelling " flush ! mush ! " if he were an American , " Marche donc ! marche ! marche ! " if he were French-Canadian . Bells on the leader set the frosty air trembling . Bright tassels gave color to the racers , of which the dogs were proud as a horse ; and on occasions the chief trader , or chief factor , ? a name that fell out of use after 1869 ? would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told of Lord Strathcona , who was then Donald Smith , having traveled in midwinter from Edmonton to Montreal , where some of the Hudson 's Bay directors were to meet him , by dog train , with fresh dogs and fresh drivers at each relay , in three weeks , and of having gone in to meet his directors with not an hour of rest , when his drivers ? one of whom was the late Senator Hardisty ? threw themselves down and , paralyzed with fatigue , slept for forty-eight hours. * The company had its birth in romance and adventure , and it has lived both , and lived them hard , since its birth . The story is part of the discovery of America . Two penniless French-Canadian adventurers , Radisson and Groseilliers , from Three Rivers had pushed up the Ottawa  | across the hinterland to James Bay from 1661 to 1664 ; whence they returned to Quebec with such cargo of beaver as set the teeth of the rapacious French governor on edge with envy . The discoverers , instead of being rewarded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were fined for having gone north without a license and stripped of all their profits in beaver pelts . The adventurers drifted down to Port Royal and conducted an expedition by sea in two small boats to Hudson Bay . Those were stirring days in Port Royal and Boston and New York . But as the French adventurers could get no justice in their own land , and were involved in a lawsuit in Boston over the expedition , they were picked up by Sir George Carteret , Charles II 's Royal Commissioner of New Jersey , and sent home with a letter of commendation to Prince Rupert of London . Prince Rupert became their patron . They were outfitted with ships for Hudson Bay and reached the far northern sea only to find French and Boston interlopers poaching on their find . The Hudson 's Bay Company was granted a royal charter the next year , with Prince Rupert the first governor , and there began the long struggle against poachers and interlopers down to the cancellation of its monopoly in 1869 . These governors included such celebrities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rail builder . Raid and counter-raid by the French followed down to the fall of the French regime at Quebec in 1759 ; and then began the bitterest fight of the company for its life . With England in control at Quebec , it might be thought the old company was secure of its tenure ; but quite the opposite materialized . Scotch merchants had poured into Montreal and Quebec . These now began to organize the dispersed French-Canadian voyageurs and couriers into expeditions to the Pays d'en Haut* by canoe . The new concern became known as the " Nor-Westers ; " and  | when the Nor-Westers began invading the Hudson 's Bay domain it was Scotchmen versus Englishmen , a blood feud of brothers , with half-breeds and Indians and ammunition and liquor as tools . This is one of the darkest and saddest pages of the adventurers ' history . The guerilla fight waged from Athabasca to the Ottawa and lasted from 1789 to 1820 , when the ruinous struggle forced the two companies to amalgamate into one ? the " Hudson 's Bay . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson 's Bay began the expansion of its transmontane empire under McLoughlin of Oregon . Up to Alaska the company 's little ships yearly went to exchange beef and wheat and mutton with the Russians for sea otter . If Sir George Simpson 's advice had been followed , the company would have bought Alaska from the Russians . Down to the Spanish presidio of San Francisco , McLoughlin 's son-in-law , Glen Rae , went to buy beef and hides and wheat ; and if Glen Rae 's plans had not miscarried in a love affair with a Spanish belle the company would have made a bid for California . When the Oregon settlers began to pour overland , starving , naked , and roofless , McLoughlin befriended them , and by so doing lost his position with the company ; but not before his pack trains under Ross and Ogden and Tom McKay had traversed every mountain pass down to modern Utah and north as far as the Athabasca . McLoughlin will probably always stand as the most worthy type of governor the company ever had . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the medical college in Quebec City ? tradition says in a hurry to escape reprimand for having knocked a British officer off the pavement . He had married the widow of  | Tom McKay who perished on Astor 's ship a splendid woman of native blood . He had climbed steadily up from clerk to chief trader and then to governor of Oregon . He stood over six feet tall , and was lithe as an Indian and straight as an arrow . In his youth he was very swarthy , but the cares of his empire whitened his long hair like fleece . He was careful of his person and his dress , usually carrying a gold-headed cane and wearing a high white choker , and a silk-lined cape over his black suit . The officers of the company earned what would be $7,000 a year of modern money . The apprenticeship began at $100 a year ; and there was no royal road to climb . Only doughty daring , brawn , and brain brought a man to the top . There was a formal distance maintained between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of a czar ; and on the whole that law was just ; for only justice enforced by fearlessness kept the Indian tribes friendly with the white men , who were as one to ten thousand . The rule was that of a beneficent despotism . That type of rule is , of course , past . Where stood the Hudson 's Bay forts , to-day tower the company 's departmental stores , and where wandered its fur brigades are to-day cities and farm empires ; but north of the wheat line Lords of the North still hold sway . I recall when reading the minutes of the company from 1668 , a year before it was chartered , in Hudson 's Bay House , Lime Street , London ? dim old records written with a goose quill in fading ink , and the reports of their sea captains and land couriers written often on beaver parchment from day to day as these old adventurers threaded the ice packs of Hudson Straits , or paddled in the canoe brigades up the Saskatchewan ? that I said to myself : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of whites , seldom more than two thousand up to 1821 , literally conquering a continent , and  | conquering it not for the sake of dominion , but for the lure of the beaver 's pelt . " There were the fights with France up on Hudson Bay , behind eighteenfoot walls of solid stone , from 1671 down to the fall of Quebec in 1759 . Then followed more sanguinary struggles : guerilla warfare , trader against trader , sometimes rum the weapon , sometimes poison , always bayonet and old flintlock in continuous use ? against the American fur trader , who came up from St. Louis to the mountains ; or the Astor men , who came around the Horn and overland up the Missouri to dominate the Pacific ; of the Scotch fur traders of Montreal , who penetrated the fur company of the Pays d'en Haut from 1759 to 1821 ; and always the old company ? bent but not broken , battered but not disabled , defeated but never licked ? came up and back , scarred but resourceful , to dominate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they amalgamated . When they foresaw , as in California and Oregon , that the British Government would not sustain their claim to dominion , they cleaned out the fur before the coming of gold stampede , overland settlers , and new estates . When the monopoly of the charter was annulled and the domain began to be carved up into provinces and states from 1871 down to the present era , the glory of the Lords of the North seemed to have passed forever . Its days of fighting rivals were over . Except in the remote northern fringe of the Arctic Zone , its fur days were over ; and even here it was threatened by free traders descending like locusts , with poison bait for traps , and longrange silent guns . It looked as if , soon , there would be no great fur domain at all . But the fur domain did not pass . Nature has pro- vided a perpetual fur domain , an area roughly the size of the northern half of Europe and Arctic Russia ; and into this area the irresponsible free-lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself than to the extermination of fur-bearing life , only a huge company with vast and varied resources could survive and vast and varied indeed are the resources of the Lords of the North . And , now , what are the conditions of fur to-day ? Styles in furs are as quick-changing and unexplainable as styles in hats and boots and hair cuts . Like the wind , they come when they list and they go when they list , and no power can say them nay . To-day , white fox like an aureole round a young girl 's face is the vogue . To-morrow , silver fox , the badge of wealth , soft as the sheen of black silk , glittering as hairs of pure silver , peculiarly beautiful on middle-aged folks , softening any line of the face , becomes the rage . Or the motor craze gets us in its grip , and anyone with a thousand dollars to burn in gasoline wants a coon coat , or a bear rug , or a wolf wrap , or an otter coat , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather and rough usage . Then there are the seasons when hats and evening dresses and evening slippers are trimmed with mink and marten and ermine . Few of these crazes , except the utility craze for motor coats , outlast six months . We had a perfect epidemic of summer fox furs in 1919 and 1920 in our hot , summer climate , because millions returning from the war had seen furs worn in Europe in the summer , where sea breezes and cool nights created the necessity . Now follow the migra- tions of a Hudson 's Bay cargo of furs . The fox and the beaver and mink and marten are taken in the north in midwinter , when the fur is at its best from excessive snow , which crisps and curls and gives life to the hair . It is August of the next summer before those furs reach even western rail points from canoe and dog brigades of the north . It is December before the furs first out reach London and are sorted ready for sale . It is March of the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and usually the best quality , reach London and are sorted ready for sale . When the fox passes through New York for London , fox is at the zenith of its craze ? $40 to $140 for white and cross fox , and as high as $1,200 for silver . The furs go into London for March sale . Meanwhile , the summer fur craze has subsided in America ; and the next winter craze is Persian lamb , or leopard , or coon . Fox falls in March with a fearful slump from $140 to $20 and $30 , and silver fox to $200 . The company in London must take the loss , or buy in its own furs , or take them off the market and store for five or six years till the craze comes round again . I could tell case after case where such delay in sales caused losses to London companies of from $200,000 to $500,000 on a single lot of beaver , or fox , or muskrat ? which has a great vogue to-day as Hudson seal . So it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the day would come when America would be the biggest buyer of furs , when sales , dyeing , and manufacturing would be transferred to American points . Sales , dye processes , and manufacturing are in America to stay ; the gentleman adventurers are still doing business at the old stand ; in 1922 the fur catch was the most plentiful and of the highest quality known for a quarter of a century ; and prices are back to the normal , with good profits for all trappers . High prices are a curse to the trade . They stop the public buying and deplete the best furs . Low prices  | are equally a curse to the trade . They cripple the best dyeing and manufacturing processes , which are necessarily high , offer no incentive to the hunter , who can live on his own kill and in his own clothes , and let the predatory animals multiply to a point that destroys the finer furs . In 1921-22 , wolves and bears were so plentiful in the north they were a menace to other game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful that they were flooding farm lands in the north . Muskrat , like rabbit , when too prolific in their burrows , become so infected with intestinal parasites and mange that they die in millions and migrate so far afield that animals dependent on them for food ? such as the wolverine , the timber wolf , the lynx ? become so poor in fur they are not worth taking and become a menace to themselves and all creatures which are their prey , like the baby caribou and baby deer . In fact , the scarcity of baby caribou in 1922 is directly traceable to the overrun of wolves . Personally , if I were a baby caribou or a fawn , I 'd prefer the quick shot of a long-range repeater to being eaten alive by wolves . In 1920 I could buy baby caribou for blankets . In 1922 I could not buy one , so terrific had been the slaughter of caribou life by the hungry wolves of the north . The whole subject of fur life is so intricate it is its own balance wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits will bring the cycle of mange , when the wolves will die off from starvation , or eat their  | young ; and then the little fellows ? otter , muskrat , mink , marten , fisher , or pekan , the most beautiful of fur ? will come back in plenty at lower prices . It does not need telling here that the old company discourages the use of poison bait , for poison spoils the fur ; discourages the use of traps in which the animal is not killed within a short time , for the trapped fur is fevered and sheds ; discourages the taking of furs in any weather but midwinter , for fur so taken is always inferior and does not pay the cost ; and discourages the killing of females with young for anything but Indian food , for that means the lessening of the next year 's supply . Nor does it need telling that the rare furs will all soon be " farmed " like the silver fox ; for the careful feeding , the protection from injury , and the painless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to animals I have ever known are the true old-time traders and trappers ; and I have known not a few who almost paid with their lives for pet wolves and bears brought up on the bottle . A bear or a wolf is a playful comrade till he comes to the mating age . Then the least said about his morals , or his manners , or his code of honor , the better for our opinion of him . He is a beast of prey , who will rip his mate open and eat her unborn young if crossed in his curious moods . It is one of the sphinx tragedies of the thing called " life " that can not be explained to-day . I have known of old ganders who mothered their orphan flock and , as Jack Miner relates , defended the common hen that brought the orphan brood up ; and I have known of bears and wolves that loved their dog chums in puppy and cubby days until adolescence , when there was another story ; and it is n't a story for copybook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sudden treachery . I have also known of ladies who pointed in reproach at my collection of  | furs , which I prefer to jewels , who had never heard of what seals do to their mates and young ; and who , themselves , wore silk , every thread of which represented a dormant life boiled to death . Man 's death to the fur bearer is ? death . No denying that ; but it is a merciful death compared to the animal 's death from its own kind . Fur farming will change the cruel features , and is applying euthanasia ? or easy death ? to that end every day ; and it may be a kink in my nature , but I can always wear a fur without a qualm , when I can not bear even to look on the feathers of a songbird in hair or hat . One is a necessity . The other is a cruel luxury . Formerly , the Hudson 's Bay Company gathered its furs to its warerooms in London and , twice a year , sold these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raw furs in the world . Until the 1800 's , the auctions were held by " light of candle . " That is , the sorted lots of each graded fur were put up . Then a candle was lighted , needles stuck in its stem , and the bids received till the candle guttered out . The last highest bidder got the furs . Of late years , the sales have been held in great exchanges and the bids received by the rap of the auctioneer 's gavel.  |
