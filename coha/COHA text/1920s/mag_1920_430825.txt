THE revolution was not unmixed felicity . " These words , uttered by Gustav Noske , Germany 's minister of defense , when I paid him a visit shortly before leaving Berlin for America , succinctly sum up the feeling in Germany today , after a year 's disappointing experience of republican government under Socialist domination . Also , they explain the torrent of reaction that has been sweeping everything before it in Germany during the last few weeks , and which is now battering down the last pillar of the republican structure ? the confidence of the working masses in their leaders ? to make way for a new monarchy before the calendar reaches the second anniversary of the revolution . The next general elections , which probably will be held in January or February , 1920 , are expected to register the country 's disapproval of the Socialist regime by returning an overwhelming anti-Socialist majority in the Reichstag , and that will be the prelude to the restoration of the monarchy . Reduced to a minority the Socialists will not be able to resist the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either active monarchists or passively approve of their designs . It is significant that Herr Noske should make the admission that the revolution was not " unmixed felicity . " Herr Noske ? himself a revolutionary leader , a life-long Socialist , a former laboring man who for many years earned his bread and butter in the humble capacity of woodworker , and , what is more , the very mainstay of the republican government because he controls the army that has kept the government where it is ? might be expected to endorse the  | new order of things . That he acts contrary to expectation is only additional proof of his stand politically . Herr Noske is no longer a Socialist . He has turned monarchist . GERMANY VEERING TOWARDS MONARCHISM IT IS human to be ambitious , and even vain . For a year generals and colonels have been doing the bidding of Noske . Incidentally , they also have been whispering a few things into his ear . For months Noske has realized which way the wind was blowing . For months he has known that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the humble woodworker who had risen to power and glory , then to sacrifice all he had achieved ? It was a bitter thought . And the monarchist leaders read his thoughts , through the penetrating insight of the high officers serving as " advisors " on his staff . The monarchists made a proposal to Noske . " Hand your army over to us when we give you the signal , and we will retain you as minister of war in the new imperial government , " they said . And Herr Noske accepted . If this is untrue , then the very monarchist leaders who claim to have effected the bargain with Noske have lied to me . But observing Noske 's general conduct and his own statement to me there is every reason to believe that they told the truth . Observe , also , the army commissions distributed over Noske 's signature to former princes of royal blood . Among royal persons given officers ' commissions by Noske and now in active service are Adolf Friedrich , former reigning duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin ; Prince Eugene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wilhelm Albert of Urach . " Princes and dukes are the protectors of our young republic , " recently lamented the Berlin Freiheit , official organ of the Independent Socialist party . The monarchists are not fearing any reluctance on the part of the army in responding to Noske 's call to sweep the Socialists out of power . A little chat with any German soldier will satisfy any inquirer. that such fear would be entirely unwarranted . The German army will set the limit  | only at William II . and the former Crown Prince . For to the German soldier the ex-Kaiser and his son are contemptible cowards who are not worthy of the imperial purple , and this opinion is pretty generally shared by the entire monarchist element . Their candidacy is hopeless . When the German monarchy is restored , Prince Wilhelm Friedrich , oldest son of the former Crown Prince , will be the incumbent of the imperial throne . This is a point on which general agreement has been reached by those who are engineering the preparations for the coup d'etat . But Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install his mother , the Crown Princess Cecilie , as regent until he becomes of age . Both are now living in Potsdam . HINDENBURG THE GERMAN WARWICK RINCE Wilhelm Friedrich probably will receive the If ) reins of government from the hands of Field Marshal General von Hindenburg who is slated by the combined reactionary parties to run for president in the next general elections . He is not likely to decline the candidacy , knowing beforehand the mission that is being cut out for him . Shortly after his retirement to civilian life , Hindenburg officially joined the Nationalist party . This incident is extremely significant . It virtually confirms his acceptance of the candidacy . And his election is as sure as the defeat of the Socialists . Hindenburg today occupies the position in Germany that the late Theodore Roosevelt did in America after the Cuban campaign ? the nation 's idol . The Socialists will enter the elections without a platform . At least , it is hard to see what sort of a platform they could offer . They have failed miserably in accomplishing any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . They have not even a record to stand on . " The Socialists promised Germany a Garden of Eden ' but gave us a Paradise Lost , ' " was the apt comment of Dr. Karl Helfferich , former imperial vice-chancellor under von Bethrn:ann-Hollweg , when I asked him to make a forecast of the next election returns . " They stand utterly discredited . They have not succeeded in embedding one  | of their cardinal tenets in the new constitution . Public ownership of industrial enterprise , the separation of religion from public schools , the abolition of capital punishment , the abolition of titles of nobility and many more of their proposals were voted down in the National Assembly by the very parties that are associated with them in the coalition government . " A perusal of Germany 's new constitution , in fact , gives the impression that it was made to serve the purposes of a constitutional monarchy . Substitute " emperor by the grace of God " for " president elected by popular vote , " and Germany 's fundamental law is sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the National Assembly , a year ago , Germany registered 30,000,000 votes . Of these the two Socialist parties polled 14,000,000 , leaving a balance of 16,000,000 for all other parties , including the Democrats and Centrists , who are represented in the coalition cabinet . At that election the women of Germany voted for the first time , and the Socialists took good care that all women members of their families went to the polls . But it is a peculiar fact that few women of the bourgeois took advantage of their franchise privilege . The reason is to be found partly in apathy , but more particularly in the old-fashioned German idea that " woman 's place is in the house . " But German husbands , fathers , brothers and sweethearts of monarchist convictions will take pains to correct this mistake the next time . Their votes should thus be doubled , and to these will be added the ballots of thousands of dissatisfied Socialists who have joined other political parties since the revolution . Also those of a million returned prisoners of war who have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes will be cast in the next German elections . The Socialists will be lucky if they receive 12,000,000 . That would leave them outnumbered almost two to one . They will be strong enough to command representation in the next cabinet , no doubt ; but they will be too weak to dominate it . That role will go to the Democrats or Centrists . It makes little difference which  | one of the two gains the ascendancy , for both are strongly monarchistic , so the end will not be altered . And the reactionaries can no longer be kept out . A COUP D'ETAT WILL BE EASY DESPAIR will lead to monarchism , " the late Dr. Friedrich Naumann , then leader of the German Democrats , confided to me some time before his death . And if there ever was a man in Germany who knew what he was talking about , it was Friedrich Naumann . It is interesting to observe that the leading men in the Democratic party include Count von Bernstorff , Count von Brockdorff ? - Rantzau , Baron Hartmann von Richthofen and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the biggest man in the Centrist party is Matthias Erzberger , whose endorsement of the pan-Germans ' annexationist designs during the first half of the war is universally known . Throw these men into a new coalition cabinet together with a few pronounced reactionaries like Dr. Helfferich and Dr. Gustav Stresemann , and watch the result , especially with Iindenburg as president . The coup d'etat will be ridiculously easy and no blood should flow in the operation . There may be some opposition by the radicals , even armed opposition , but it will not be strong enough to seriously interfere with the monarchists . The German Spartacides and Communists have lost their grip on the country . Their cause went down to defeat with the failures of Munich and Budapest . Observe that there has not been a political strike in Germany in months . They may possess limited stores of arms and ammunition . But they should not forget that Noske will be on hand to deal with them as he did last March and at every subsequent radical eruption . Noske has spilled enough radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire a complete reversion to the old form of government . Their leaders realize that the German people are in no mood to surrender the political liberties ( such as universal suffrage ) gained by the revolution . The new kaiserdom will be a replica of the British constitutional monarchy . This is the aim of leaders like  | Dr. Stresemann and Count Arthur Posadowsky-Wehner , according to their own statements to me . Their main domestic policy will be the admission of German Austria into the restored empire . Their foreign policy will be initiated with strong representations to the Entente to restore Germany 's colonies and her pre-war boundary lines . These policies at least will give them . popularity at home . It is fortunate for the monarchists that the republican administration has not held a general house cleaning in the various government departments . The old machinery has been-left practically intact . If one made a round of the offices of Wilhelmstrasse in search of Socialist officials and employees the investigation would be barren of results . I have had dealings with every ministry in Berlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or employee who was not a confessed monarchist , left over from the old regime . The Socialist cabinet ministers themselves are , of course , exceptions . And during the Scheidemann regime it was commonly said in Germany that Herr Scheidemann 's greatest regret was that the Kaiser had abdicated , otherwise he ( Scheidemann ) would have been entitled to be addressed " your excellency . " The fact is that Herr Scheidemann very frequently was addressed as " excellency " ( for instance by foreign newspaper correspondents , including myself ) , and I have never heard him object to the title . GERMANY FACING ECONOMIC PARALYSIS THE restored monarchy ? provided of course , that the coup d'etat succeeds ? will have some complicated and difficult internal problems to solve , and it is a question if the royalists can do better than the Socialists in re-establishing sound economic working conditions . They think they can , basing their arguments on the fact that they have the majority , and on the promise to restore a firm government in which the world will have confidence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Industrially and commercially , Germany , handicapped by lack of raw materials and by a coal famine , is approaching stagnation . Unless relief is rendered soon from outside  | she will be paralyzed economically and become a serious liability on the world 's balance sheet . It would be a simple matter if we could merely wipe the liability off our books and be done with the problem . But we ca n't . There is too much merchandise we need from Germany and too big a market for foreign goods ' in Germany to enable us to dispense with her so summarily . So we must help her , not for her own sake but for ours . She will have to pull through the coal crisis the best she knows how . We are in no position to aid her , with our own house afire . France could help by lending her back some of the rolling stock turned over under the Armistice agreement . For , unlike America , Germany is not suffering from coal shortage for lack of present production . Her coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-hour day several months ago and compromised on seven , have gone back to work and are producing enough to fill all requirements . But Germany needs railroad cars to haul the coal . The coal shortage is manifesting its presence by unheated flats , gas for cooking only three hours a day ( divided into three periods of one hour each ) , railroad service cut to one-third and hot water in apartments limited to twice a month . These are the lighter manifestations of Germany 's coal crisis , if one may be justified in using that phrase . The more seribus phase of the situation is curtailed industry . At least one-half of Germany 's factories are idle , and the rest are working half-time or less . Many factories are running only 5 to 10 per cent of normal capacity . This at a time when the demand for German goods is nothing less than phenomenal , owing largely to the depreciation of the German mark which enables foreign buyers to purchase at extremely low prices . Merchants in Holland , Switzerland , Denmark , Norway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on German merchandise , thanks to the demoralized state of the exchange . British and French merchants , not so scrupulous as Americans in observing the dictates of patriotism when there is an opportunity to do legitimate business with the late enemy , are doing fully as  | well as their neutral competitors in the German trade . Long before the peace treaty was signed Germany was honeycombed by British and French merchants who sold raw materials and bought all the manufactured goods they could get . It is reported from many sources , in and out of Germany , that the British sold huge quantities of raw materials of American origin , purchasing them in the United States on long-term credits and selling them to the Germans on a similar basis ; in other words , doing a rushing business on American capital and clearing a middleman 's profit to which they were fully entitled but which might have been earned by Americans . NEED OF RAW MATERIALS AND FOOD " GIVE us enough raw materials and food , and we will have normal industrial conditions in Germany within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Max Haller , director of the Siemens-Schuckert electric works at Spandau . Herr Haller should know a little about his subject , for he is the directing genius of one of the biggest plants in Germany , employing 50,000 laborers . Germany is now working with the scant stocks of raw materials left over from the war , and whatever she purchased from England and neutral neighbors before the mark took its spectacular downward tumble . She can not now buy raw materials . The mark at present fluctuates between 2 and 2% cents American money . To purchase $20,000 worth of American raw materials , Germany must pay nearly one million marks . No German could afford to buy goods made from raw materials obtained at such excessive cost . What is the solution ? We can buy the goods . Let Germany work for us ! We could sell Germany as much raw stock as we could spare and let her pay in part with the goods manufactured from these raw stocks , that is in labor . We should still have the goods cheaper than we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the American scale . A German laborer is well paid at 30 marks a day . Few receive  | 50 marks . And even 50 marks today is little more than $1 American money . And the transaction need not interfere with American wage-earners in the least . We could pick the lines of goods we are accustomed to import . Fair-sized loans to Germany , granted on the stipulations suggested above , should help stabilize exchange . It is a certainty that unless the mark is brought back to somewhere near its pre-war value , Germany will never be able to pay a war indemnity . If Germany were taxed $25,000 , - 000,000 ( the amount actually offered by former Minister of Finance Dernburg ) , she would , if we figure the exchange at 2.50 , have to pay something like 1,000,000,000,000 marks ! It would take a creditor of more than ordinary imagination to discover a way of collecting that amount from an unproductive debtor . Yet it was stated last summer that $25,000,000,000 would not cover Germany 's debt to the Entente . Even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of a paltry 23,000,000,000 marks ? Germany is now experiencing extreme difficulty . This amount is equal to the total annual income of all Prussians in excess of 3,000 marks . CAPITAL FLEEING THE COUNTRY HERR ERZBERGER is the author of the law appropriating big fortunes , starting with 10 per cent of fortunes aggregating 50,000 marks , and advancing to 63.9 per cent on fortunes of 100,000,000 marks and more . This measure has brought the curses of German business men and manufacturers on Erzberger . The following statement made to me by Dr. Helfferich expresses the sentiment : " It was about the worst thing that could be done at this moment when every penny of capital is so essential for industrial enterprise . ' The time set for the application of the pruning knife is January , 1920 . Herr Erzberger , however , is likely to be the most disappointed , in addition to being the most hated man in Germany , when he counts the result . Herr Erzberger had hardly introduced his unpopular bill in the National Assembly when a new word suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kapitalflucht , " meaning the flight of capital . And it did fly , by the million , over the German border to neutral safety . It went ? and is still going ? by aeroplane , by boat and in the baggage of professional smugglers posing as traveling business men . And while the government is howling and the newspapers writing columns about it , the practise goes on without hindrance . The customs officials at the border stations think vastly more of a hundred-mark bill than they do of the government or ten pages of newspaper comment . It is typical of the extent of the " Kapitalflucht " that an agent approached me when I was leaving for America and suggested that I , for a consideration of 2,000 marks , smuggle 2,000,000 marks to Holland in my baggage . When I declined he offered me 300 marks for my passport , observing that I , as a newspaper correspondent who knew all government officials , " certainly could get out of Germany without a passport . " Before the word " Kapitalflucht " made its advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gained popular recognition . It is difficult to define a " Schieber . " The word is derived from the German verb " schieben " ? to shove . The man who suggested that I take the 2,000,000 marks to Holland would properly be classified as a " Schieber . " Bribe-taking customs officials are petty " Schiebers . " A profiteer , a grafter and a gambler come under the same classification . Any person whose dealings are open to criticism is a " Schieber . " And that means that almost every living German is a " Schieber " of some sort or other . The dearth of food and clothes has made it extremely difficult for the average German to exist . The small group of profiteers who flourish on their fellow men 's misfortunes have no difficulty , for they can pay the exorbitant prices charged by vendors of food and clothes who procure their stocks in the extensive sneak trade which is made possible by graft and collusion with officials charged with the equitable distribution of commodities . Some restaurants offer palatable dinners at 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German , with an income of 250 marks a week , paying 100 marks for a dinner ! Under such conditions it is not to be wondered at that the average German turns his hand to anything that will yield him a living . German scientists estimate that starvation is claiming 25,000 lives a month in Germany . Hospitals and sanitariums are crowded with consumptives who contracted the malady from malnutrition . And bearing in mind that Germany has none of the nourishing foods required to counteract the great white plague , consumption in Germany is tantamount to death . IMMORALITY AND CRIME INCREASING STARVATION has engendered immorality and crime . Murders and " hold-ups " are common . Burglary and theft have become second nature to a large element of Germans who five years ago could boast spotless reputations . The authorities are powerless . The best policemen and detectives were killed in the war . Those that are left are bribed into collusion with the criminals . Policemen , too , have families to support , and the salary does n't reach half way . The sapping of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakening mentality manifests itself in an appetite for immoral books and plays ; and authors , playwrights and producers are catering generously to the new demand . While it is true that the majority of German theatres attempt to stem the tide of demoralization and produce only healthy plays , it also is true that a growing number of German playhouses are specializing in dramas so filthy and obscene that they can not even be discussed . This is what German " Kultur " is coming to . In children the effect of starvation on the mind is lack of energy to play and inability to follow their studies at school . The next generation of Germans is done for , even if complete relief were offered immediately . It is too late to rescue Germany 's youth from its doom . That should give France a feeling of security for the future . Herr Haenisch , Socialist and Prussian Minister of  | Education , expounded to me a beautiful educational program for Prussia 's public schools . He said : " The idea of hatred and revenge will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught that the redemption of the fatherland is to be achieved through useful work , not through another bloody war . Our text-books will be revised to conform to this plan of education , and the writings of the German League of Nations Society are to be introduced in our public schools in the form of lectures . " All this sounds beautiful and idealistic . But how can an underfed brain grasp such ideals ? As a contrast the Pan-German League proposes to establish special schools , " accessible to all , " where the " future rebuilders of the fatherland " are to be " filled with love for their people and contempt for those that have harmed and would harm Germany . " But the undernourished brain of German children is in no condition to register either love or contempt . At best it may be capable of intelligent apathy . AMERICANS POPULAR IN GERMANY IT IS typical of the German mental state that they for some unaccountable reason have come to regard Americans as their bosom friends . And it never occurs to them that Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was to " safeguard our financial interests in England " and to " frighten Japan by a display of power " that we went to war , according to ninety-nine out of every hundred Germans . If you mention the unrestricted submarine warfare , it is at once defended as a " legitimate weapon against the blockade imposed by England . " The sinking of the Lusitania is justified on the ground that " the ammunition she carried would have killed thousands of Germans . " It is hopeless to argue with them . And it is impossible to get on bad terms with them . Next to Hindenburg there is nobody in Germany as popular as an American citizen . We hold the purse strings , the food and the raw materials , and they know it . Without us Germany would be ruined forever .  | The English are treated courteously but distantly . They are recognized as a sportsmanlike race that would not trample on a prostrate adversary . Yet every German harbors a certain amount of distrust for Englishmen that is entirely absent in his dealings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair trick by entering into the war . For the French , they have nothing but outspoken contempt and burning hatred . The French are blamed for the severity of the peace treaty , and they alone are singled out for revenge . Very frequently a German will speak of the " next war . " If you ask , " Against whom ? " the answer invariably is , " France , of course . " But this loudly-heralded war of revenge is a remote possibility . True , there are enough men of military age in Germany today to raise a formidable army . But the present generation has had enough of war to satisfy it for some time to come , and the next generation of Germans will lack the energy to indulge in martial practises . Germany 's immediate outlook is black hopelessness . She stands on the brink of economic ruin . And the Socialist government , having failed in everything it undertook , has not the power to inspire courage . Right riow interest is centered on the next general elections which are expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the next six months we shall probably see the monarchy once more firmly ensconced in Germany , and before another new year dawns we should know how wisely or how foolishly the Germans calculated .  |
