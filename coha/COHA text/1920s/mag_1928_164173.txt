She was nice to look at-a lean little body and all dressed up in rakish clothes that nobody had ever seen before . Men said she was fast ; but she was no girl for rough weather . They sent her out to sea as a noble experiment . A week passed and they did n't hear from her whose name was Rofa , 50-foot schooner , smallest of four small schooners racing from Sandy Hook to Santander , Spain . Her rigging was peculiar-designed by Herreshoff , who learned about sails in Scandinavian fjords . On the morning of the seventh day out , she had covered 800 miles and was making splendid headway , with her mainsail , foresail , forestay sail and jib set and full . Suddenly , a squall hit little Rofa . <P> Capt . William Roos , of Pelham Manor , N. Y. , owner of Rofa , lived to tell what happened : " The squall caught us with terrific force before we could shorten sail . The mainsail was first to go . It broke off with a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of mast tumbled into the sea , carrying the heavy gear with it . <P> " Six minutes later , the foremast was split to the deck and carried the foresail and headsail down with it . The boom fell athwart the cabin , crushing it in and while we had a narrow escape , nobody was injured . . . . The snapped masts floating in the water threatened to crash into our side as they were pounded along by the waves . <P> " Everybody worked like beavers chopping away the gear and freeing the floating masts . Then we set up a low-rigged square sail which steadied the Rofa . The squall lasted 20 minutes and the weather was calmer for the rest of the day . As darkness began falling , we were aware that we had to get some assistance and we discharged six Very rockets . . . . " <P> An oil tanker , Tuscarora , saw the rockets , rescued the crew of the Rofa - five men , one woman . The Rofa was towed for half the night ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> U. S. newspapers made much of the luck of the crew of the Rofa . They said that it was a miracle for another ship to run across her in the middle of the ocean , and that miracles only happen when a woman is skipper . Meanwhile , Mrs. William Roos , 36 , experienced and muscular skipper , was telling her rescuers : " I do n't want this thing to be made sensational . " <P> <P> The other small schooners in the race - Mohawk , Nina , Pinta - were nearing the coast of Spain , if the ocean was kind to them . Only Nina had been sighted , early in her voyage , by the Cunarder Aquitania ( TIME , July 16 ) . Elihu Root Jr. , and Paul Hammond are in command of Nina . Their crew consists of eight young college graduates and undergraduates and a Norwegian cook . Said Mr. Root : " We rather expect to get wet . If the Nina runs into a storm , her crew will have salt water in their clothes , their food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it had not been for the Rofa incident , the public would scarcely have known that the sporting little schooners were racing . Even the five big schooners - Atlantic , Azara , Elena , Guinevere , Zodiac - racing for the King Alfonso Cup , were nearly wiped off U. S. sport pages by Tunney-Heeney , baseball , Olympics .
