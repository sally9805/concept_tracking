To New Orleans last week returned Dr. Franz Blom from seven months in Central America and Mexican jungles . His party had been hunting Mayan vestiges . Their best find was cloth 1,500 years old . Interesting was evidence of a game quite like squash played by the aborigines . <P> Disgusting , however , was the food they were obliged to eat when their civilized provender gave out . Edible berries abounded , but often resembled poisonous kinds . They gingerly tried armadillo meat , scooping the flesh from the bowl-like shells . It had a faint herby taste . In extremity they killed small monkeys , skinned them , put the little , human-like heads out of nauseating sight , gutted and boiled the creatures . Monkey meat they found pallid , tasteless . Spices thrown into the soup pots made the meat palatable . <P> Testimony indicates that unorthodox foods can be made appetizing . Snake and chicken are much alike. * Like white meat of chicken too are frog legs . Horse meat is sweet , dog steaks flat . Rat and cat are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter have a quaint taste , are tough to chew . Human flesh is sweet . Toasted grasshoppers have a nutty flavor . Earthworms , washed clean and gently stewed , have a tangy tartness . <P> <P> * Each summer freshmen at the Pennsylvania State College summer forestry camp are made to eat a dish of rattlesnake . African Negroes relish boa-constrictors.
