Chief Usher said he had learned that Mary had left home " just for fun , " and that she had had " about enough fun . ' ? Hotel Clerk Tells Story . Edward Towers , clerk of the Hotel Carleton at Hudson Falls , established the identity of the girl . He told his story ever the telephone to Ttta TIMES last night as follows : " This girl came up to the desk late Wednesday afternoon . I have her signature bete before me ? , Mrs. Charlotte Blake . She seemed quite young , 17 or 18. but may have been still younger . She war , dressed entirely in black , a small tight black hat , black coat and black fur , black stockings , and , if I re ' member right , her shoes were of brown suede . She came in a taxi from the station . " Sloe was at her ease . She said she wanted a room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She went into the , dining room ? and ordered a fairly heavy meal . It was before regular dinner time and there was some delay . Just then two girls came into the room , and he got up and greeted them . They seemed to be friends . She called the Waiter and told him to cancel her order , that she was going out to dinner . " Sloe left with the girls , who are 18 or 19 years old .. One of them is Leola Vaughn . She does n't work . Her father 's name is Wilfred Vaughn , in the trwelting business . He lives here in Hudson Falls1 at 5 Center Street . The name of the other girl is Miss Breen , She 's a stenographer but I do n't know where she lives . Gave Him $10 Bill . " This Mrs. Blake went out with them the next morning . As she was leaving I ' stepped up to her and told her that it was a rule a guest must pay in advance unless there was baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $10 bill . I asked her how . long she was going to stay . Then she wanted to know how much it cost a day . " When I told her that the rate was $2.50 a day she said : ' Take enough out for today and tomorrow . ' " Then she went out with the two girls again and was gone all day and through the evening . The next morn ' ing she came up to the desk anti asked me If 1 knew how much a ticket to Los Angeles cost . I replied I did n't know , but that 1 . would find out . " So she waited while I called the railroad station at Fort Edward , on the main line . Then I told her the ticket would be about 5125 plus $25 for meals and a lower berth . She made a wry face . She went out for a while , then . Miss ? . Vaughn and Miss Breen called for her . She said she would check Out . ? ? " She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw her on the street next day with Miss Vaughn and I heard she and Miss Vaughn left fdr New York that afternoon . " I did n't suspect anything until Sunday . when I saw some Albany papers with something about a ? missing girl . I read the description -- young , tali , slim , dressed in black , from New York . Then I notified our Chief of Police . " Residente'Had Seen Her . ' After taking mental note of all of , Towers 's observations , Chief , Usher said he inquired around the village and learned that residents had observed the slim , sombre young stranger not only on Saturday , but on the following day . After that , however , she dise.p- peared . Considering her announced intention of going to New York , the Chief went to Fort Edward , on the main line of the Delaware &; Hudson Railroad . " I went to the ticket agent and asked him if a tall , slender young lady in black had bought a ticket to New York . He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some place out West ? ' and he replied that he had sold no ticket to any-girl of the description . " That was a little discouraging , but , on the other hand , it indicated she was still around these parts , so today I took a chance and wandered over to Glens Falls . I asked the ticket agent there . He said nothing doing . So then I went over to the end of the trolley line and asked every conductor that came in ' How about a tall , slim girl in black ? You seen anything of her ? ' " I was about ready to give up , but finally I struck the right one . He told me she had gone to Lake George with another girl . I got in my machine and headed for Lake George . I got out and walked around a little . " I asked people if they had seen the girl . Finally a girl told me to go up to the ice cream store . There was this Cabe11 girl sitting there sipping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along with me . They saw I was an officer and they came . " On the way back in the car I told her I knew she was Mary G. Cabell. and she did n't say anything . I asked . ' How about it ? You might as well tell me all about it . ' " She admitted who she was , but she would n't say another world . I had a hard time even getting her to talk with her folks . So I called Mrs. and she took her up to a room in the hotel to wait for her father . " Parents Are Reticent . The Cabelis were disinclined last night to admit that she had had been found . " We have no official information , " said Mrs. S. B. Self , half-sister of Mary , who has acted as spokesman , " only rumors . " But a few minutes after midnight Mr. Cabell , who has been too distraught to see reporters since the disappearance of his daughter , walked jauntily out of the apartment building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would only say , " Well , Mary 's a lot nearer New York than Dallas , Texas . " The final discovery of Mary at a MARY CABELL , Fifteen-Year-Old Spence School Girl . Found Yesterday . late hour last night was discredited at first because of the fog of rumors that poured in throughout the day from points between Dallas , Texas , and Greenwich Village . Some of the rumors were credited by the police as authentic and one of them , picturing the young school miss as an applicant for a motion picture job on the day she left home , were still given same credence last night . Michael Connolly , casting director for Fox Film Studios , Fifty-fifth Street and Tenth Avenue , who interviewed 400 would-be screen stars last Wednesday and Thursday , was certain that he had received a visit from the girl , who , he said , he had turned down because she was not the type he sought .
