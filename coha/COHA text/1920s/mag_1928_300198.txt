For many a week , reports had sifted through that 1929 would see the lifting of Cuban restrictions on production of sugar cane . Producers had made calculations , had figured that Cuba 's sugar crop , now over 4,000,000 tons , without restriction would reach 4,500,000 , perhaps 5,000,000 . Yet U. S. sugar men frowned , last week , when the conservative Journal of Commerce ( N. Y. ) reported the word " determined " as issuing from the Presidential mouth of Cuba 's Gen. Gerardo Machado y Morales . Still frowning , sugarmen considered an appeal to Congress to boost tariff rates , another appeal to Cuban producers to conclude a " Gentleman 's Agreement . " <P> It would have been permissible for sugarmen to frown , last week , at nearly every piece of news which concerned their industry . Profound is the depression in the sugar business . Raw sugar has fallen from 5.09 a pound in Jan. , 1927 , to 1.91 last fortnight , the lowest price on record . Over the same period , refined sugar has slipped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It was natural , therefore , that sugarmen should look forward to 1929 with misgivings . Facing the certainty of huge Javanese production , the probability of an unlimited Cuban supply , sugarmen saw little reason to hope for high price levels . They could cling to no solid , saving spar . But they could clutch , if they liked , at either of two straws : <P> First Straw . As everyone knows , cane sugar producers in Louisiana must fight diseases , blights . Untiringly , U. S. government experts have sought hardier , sturdier varieties of cane . And last week the Department of Agriculture announced results of an 11,100-mile tour of exploration through Papua and New Guinea , by air plane , canoe , foot . Explorer E. W. Brandes had discovered 167 varieties of sugar cane . <P> Last Straw . There are two ways of relating supply to demand . One is to cut down the supply . The other is to increase the demand . At the paternal Sugar Institute , last week , plans were on foot to assemble an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a fact and a question . The fact : Sugar , a hydro carbon ( C12H22O11 ) is the only organic chemical which is manufactured chemically pure on a tonnage basis . Hydrocarbons are easily broken down . Atoms of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , may be taken from them , forming new and different hydrocarbons . Possible uses of sugar are in the manufacture of shoe polish , soap , explosives , fuel , essential oils . Conceivably a vast industrial opportunity lies behind the purity of sugar . The question : Why does n't industrial chemistry find for sugar other factories than the stomach ? <P> Appropriately the official attention-caller was revealed as Rudolph Spreckels . As all Californians know , the fame of the sugar family Spreckels rests on sugar pioneering . And the bright , particular fame of Rudolph Spreckels emerged from the succor he gave an ailing sugar business exactly 30 years ago . <P> <P> Spreckels . All Californians know the history of the Sugar Family Spreckels . Father Claus , immigrant grocery boy , had left Germany in 1848 to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German bride and settled in San Francisco . From this time on , he lived in a state of perpetual warfare .
