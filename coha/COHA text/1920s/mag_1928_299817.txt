Britons ever have been slaves ! <P> - Communist Jibe . <P> What disgruntled Red agitators call " the slave mentality of British workingmen " was exhibited at Swansea , Wales , last week , when the 75th ( " Diamond Jubilee " ) British Trade Union Congress ( representing all the major unions ) , was called to order by a onetime weaver , Ben Turner , a snowy bearded patriarch of 65 , always " Ben , " never " Bennie . " <P> Ben opened with a homily upon the enslavement of the British workingman to Drink and Gambling . Not that Ben advocated prohibition or anything that would throw brewers or distillers out of work , " but , " said he sagely , " over 600,000,000 $3,000,000,000 are spent annually in Great Britain on these two social customs , principally on the workingman 's beer and his bets on horses and dog racing . " <P> " All this , " cried Patriarch Ben , " is a waste of our manhood ! " <P> Next Ben touched upon Peace and Disarmament , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers in munitions factories : " The Kellogg Treaty adds a bit , " he said , " yes it adds a bit , but only a bit to that peace mentality that needs creating . . . . Disarmament touches the interests of the working class , but it might be cheaper to pension all those engaged in naval or military work than to let them continue unholy preparations for war . " <P> Gradually , as President Ben opened and showed his mind , observers understood why the British Unions were whipped in the General Strike ( TIME , May 10 to Nov. 29 , 1926 ) , why they have just accepted a 2% cut in railway wages ( TIME , Aug. 6 ) , and why Great Britain is so safe for Constitutional Monarchy and employer Peers . <P> The Trade Union Congress , settling to business , refused to admit delegates from the Seamen 's Union ( suspected of being red ) ; refused to receive a delegation of unemployed coal miners who had walked many a mile from their mine to appeal for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famed as " Jumping Jack Jones , " when he rose to protest that the seamen and miners ought to be granted at least a hearing . <P> In pre-General Strike times " Jumping Jack " was one of the most popular Laborites in England and the enfant terrible of the House of Commons . Nowadays , with jobs scarce and employers holding the whip hand , Mr. Jones no longer jumps . His howlers down cried , " Keep out the Reds , but let all the rest in ! " <P> Even potent James Henry Thomas , famed " Balance Wheel of British Labor , " was without his usual dynamic optimism as he informed the Congress that the Railway Men 's Unions , of which he is General Secretary , are now slightly dwindling in membership . " People , " said Mr. Thomas indignantly , " tell the workers not to believe what their leaders say , and say that the leaders have sold them . " It is Mr. Thomas who has risen from a grimy engineer 's cab to a snug little mansion with flagstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to enjoying an occasional audience with His Majesty , who is reported to consider Laborite Thomas ' ideas extremely sound . <P> The Congress , after barkening to a few more leaders , plunged into consideration of Labor 's issue-of-the-hour : MONDISM.
