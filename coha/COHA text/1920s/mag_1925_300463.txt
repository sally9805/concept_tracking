Foolish the farmer who , having dug into his pocket to buy a horse , leaves the beast munching in his stable and trudges to town afoot . <P> Some such homily was intended by the Department of the Interior , whose Bureau of Education last week announced a waste of 250 millions in country schools of the U. S. The attendance of 72,120 children in 70 counties of 10 states was examined . 141.7 days in the 365 was the average total attendance . Half the children had attended school less than seven and a half months , a fourth less than five months , over an eighth less than three months . In schools having nine-month terms , the average attendance was 70% , compared with 60% in seven-month terms . Pupils who had less than 130 days of schooling fell a year and a half behind grade in reading and spelling ability . <P> What excuses for thus leaving the educational horse to eat his head off , and the upkeep of the school-barn to run along without return ? The Bureau of Education found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it less serious for the younger than for the older children to miss school . . . . Trivial excuses such as ' went to town , ' ' ran an errand , ' ' got up late , ' ' had shoes repaired . ' " <P> Having made its discovery , the Bureau lapsed into silence again , with perfunctory repetition of the classic hortative : " Closer co-operation between the teacher and parent . . . . "
