MR . BUCKNER is rampaging again with the padlock , armed further with the ability to take himself seriously . It may not be widely known that the Bar Association recently came close to not taking in one of the young lawyers who procured evidence for Buckner in the early days . The agitation centered about whether it was unprofessional for a lawyer to procure evidence . It is certainly not widely known what quieted the agitation . It was humor . A letter was read at the meeting from a prominent judge , pointing out that Buckner had practically made New York dry , which struck the revered lawyers as priceless . They became weak with laughter and gave in . But Mr. Buckner is without humor  --  luckily for his career .

THE annual controversy over the inadequate opera situation continues . We are not in sympathy with those who want two Grand Operas . There never has been , and , we think , there never will be two Grand Operas in one community ; one would be Grand and the other Nearly Grand . True Grand Opera has a social complexion . What we want , in addition to the Metropolitan , is a small opera house in which the human voice is not asked to carry a quarter of a mile over the din of two score fiddlers , and in which we can buy a seat for much less than $8.25 .

UNTIL one tires of repetition of grotesque incidents , there is an amusing time in store whenever an intelligent person returns from Hollywood and observation of the out-ofstudio performances of our moving picture plutocracy . The latest tale from darkest Haysiland concerns a director of comedies who is , among other things , an egoist of the first regard . He had been invited as one of a party to dine in the home of one of Pasadena 's cultured hostesses and  --  rightly or wrongly  --  he regarded himself as the lion of the occasion . He knew , of course , how lions disported themselves on the screen . Accordingly he arrived for the dinner an hour late  --  and found the other guests well along in the courses . " So sorry ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We waited half an hour for you . I hope you do n't mind our sitting down without you ? " " Not at all , " conceded the director of comedies , rising to the occasion in the guise of one of Nature 's gentlemen . " I 've had my dinner . " " So sorry , " murmured his hostess , again . " But do sit down , anyway . " " No , thanks . I 'll just stand around , " muttered the suave director , smoothing thus an awkward situation . And , leaning his elbow against the mantel-piece , he toppled over a vase , which shattered on the hearthstone . Carillon THE Thursday and Sunday eve- ning carillon concerts played from the belfry of the Baptist Church at Sixty-fourth Street and Park Avenue  --  the former at eight o'clock and the latter at seven  --  have already become part of the life of the town . There is talk even now of asking the municipal authorities to divert traffic from the vicinity of the church during the recitals , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is to be hoped that this notion will be forwarded and that there is sufficient appreciation within City Hall to permit granting of the request when it is made formally . It may seem a bit surprising that THE NEW YORKER such a novelty as the carillon  --  which was given to the church by Mr. John D. Rockefeller , Jr. ? should have become popular so rapidly . Yet , this is readily understandable when it is known that the Park Avenue carillon is the finest in the world , consisting as it does of fifty-three bells , and that the carilloneur , M. Anton Brees , is regarded as one of the great masters of this medium in music . He is a native of Antwerp , where his father , M. Gustaaf Brees , is both organist and carilloneur for the Cathedral of Notre Dame . The art of carillon playing has , in the past , been restricted almost entirely to Belgium , where it originated and was given its early development , and t.3 Holland and England . There are other chimes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these does one hear the complicated systems of bells which constitute the carillons of Antwerp , Bruges and other Belgian cities . Carillon playing , then , is indigenous to Flanders , and , as seems natural , its greatest exponents are Flemish . It is an art handed on from father to son . In some Flemish churches the carilloneurs for many generations have been of the same family , IN arranging his programs , M. Brees I considers the ordinary taste in music , as well as the developed one . He begins his concerts with arrangements of the simpler folk songs  --  Irish , Scotch , Flemish , and other old melodies  --  and includes always something of Chopin , Mendelssohn , Brahms , or some similar master . This is in keeping with the European tradition , which has it , that the carillon is the music of the multitude . The Park Avenue carillon represents an advance over previous chimes of approximately similar size , for a special attachment on the clapper of each bell makes it possible for the carilloneur to modulate tone volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however often struck , always had the same value , and went on welling into the melody until its last vibrations died off in the dim distance . Error IT would be gross discourtesy to A allow Mayor Hylan to depart from office without passing along the last  --  one hopes  --  tale of his impressiveness as our civic host . The British delegation to the Interparliamentary Union was being received on the steps of the City Hall . In attendance upon Mayor Hylan were several members of his cabinet , including , at his side , Police Commissioner Enright , who wore formal morning garb for the occasion , an attire which sits right well upon him indeed . The Mayor droned on through the passages of his welcoming address . As he concluded , one of the British party leaned towards an auditor , and , indicating by a nod the superb Police Commissioner , whispered : " Very well done , indeed ; but , tell me , does your Mayor always have his dark read his speeches ? " Late News IT is interesting , that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fey Club and Mrs. Richard T. Wilson 's Lido-Venice bicker with Mr. Emory Buckner over such matters as padlocks , we note , on all sides , the optimistic smiles of " big money " returning into the night life of Manhattan . New York , the capitalists of Broadway side-streets say , has gone dead on night club life ; padlocks , the meretricious cheapness made necessary by the impermanence of vogue , and a lack of imagination in planning late evening amusement , have all contributed to the great after-theatre ennui of Gotham . And something must be done about it . PLEASANTEST of the plans we have heard , is that Mr. E. Ray Goetz is to do more for New York than present Senorita Raquel Meller in special matinees ; he is to give us the privilege of seeing her as the petite flower girl of her own night club , a noteworthy arrangement , for hers is the charm of intimacy . The old Club Royale in the East Fifties is already in the hands of decorators preparing for her advent , which may be soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that La Senorita is to receive $1,500 for a single stage performance , one may shudder at the thought of the cover charge . At the same time , Mr. Goetz is looking in upon the improvements he is ordering in Gilds Gray 's old Rendezvous , which is to be the background for none other than Mlle. Irene Bordoni . Gone to another extreme is Mr. Vincent Lopez who has only just taken over Mr. Phil Baker 's Rue de la Paix , which he hopes to make profitable by more popular , rather than even higher cover charges . His rival for supreme jazz honors , Mr. Paul Whiteman , by the way , has definitely come out with the opinion that night clubs are not for the super-jazz orchestra , not his at least . Any good band , says he , is good enough for dancing . In the meantime , a rejuvenated Club Ciro has opened with as pretentious a show as midnight New York has seen so far this year ; and Florence Mills is already rehearsing a show of proportions , in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bringing it down from the Harlem to rest at the Plantation . There are indeed , big things planned in the night club world . Profit 1 ? ? HERE is an immutable justice , A as follows One of the Messire McGraw 's younger baseball pitchers , en tour with the Giants , dallied out beyond the hour at which all good baseball players were expected to be in slumber deep . Rather than run the risk of discovery by walking through the hotel lobby , he struggled manfully up the fire escape to his room . He stumbled , while climbing into his room , and sprained his ankle slightly . An explanation was demanded next morning by the Messire McGraw . " I slipped on the bath mat , " said the young pitcher . " Two hundred dollars fine for being so careless , " pronounced the Messire McGraw , who has never slipped on a bath mat . The account of this incident was printed in the sporting columns of the press . Accordingly , on his return to New York , the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm manufacturing non-slippable bath mats . ' Would the young pitcher , it inquired , be willing to endorse the nun-slippable product . The company was even anxious to pay five hundred dollars for this testimonial . There is , indeed , an immutable justice . Compositions AIR . DEEMS TAYLOR , one learns , has finished his jazz symphony , " Circus Days , " for Paul Whiteman ; and it is now being orchestrated and cut into parts , an operation that will require several more weeks . The first public performance of the Taylor opus will take place Tuesday night , December 29th in the Metropolitan Opera House , that being one of the off nights of Mr. Casazza 's troupe . The piece , as now scored , runs about forty minutes , and there will be interest in musical circles as to whether an audience will sit through that much uninterrupted jazz . The composition will not be cut for its premiere anyway ; and if it has to be shortened only the road will suffer . Mr. Taylor , by the way , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Music in Philadelphia , which is now in its first season as an exponent of modern ideas in music . It was founded by Mrs. Edward W. Bolt , who as all readers of the " Americanization " know , is the daughter of Cyrus H. K. Curtis , the publisher . The backers of the school have long been after Mr. Taylor , but he was occupied with criticism and building a farm house in Connecticut . Both of these pursuits he has abandoned , however , at least for the present . His friends say that he left the farm with reluctance , but felt the Philadelphia job would allow him more time to compose the American opera which he has undertaken to ? finish for the Metropolitan by next year . He has already finished the symphonic poem based on " Jurgen " for the New York Symphony orchestra and which we look forward to hearing in Carnegie Hall this November . Standard IT appears that conductors of orchestras are not the only ones who are received with quaint honors in the pro vinces . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit , at the conclusion of which a lady  --  filled with local pride ? asked for an opinion on the works of the one and only Mr. Eddie Guest . " He writes nice verse , " said Mr. Robinson , politely and evasively . " Nice verse , " echoed the lady scornfully . " Nice verse . " Then she bethought herself of a new line of attack . " What kind of car do you driv ? " she demanded . Mr. Robinson confessed manfully that he did not drive any . " Eddie Guest drives a Cadillac , " said the lady , triumphantly , and strode out of the group of admirers . John , Tiller ONLY a few , perhaps , realize that  --  ? the death of John Tiller , which provided a brief paragraph in last week 's journals , marks the passing of an important figure in our theatrical world . The swift precision of a thousand arms and legs , the grace and balance of the Tiller Girls , these everyone knows . But the kindly , untheatrical old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an anachronism in the profession , an avoider of personal publicity . It was forty years ago that Mr. Tiller , a young gentleman doing well in the import and export line , turned to the stage . He was driven by the subtle influence of amateur theatricals . He had been the organizer of a minstrel troupe in Manchester , a thing of ballads , songs , and occasional dances relished by the Britisher . Afterward , he set out to train his own professional troupes , and since then 25,00o-odd Tiller girls have footed it with more than military precision through numberless revues . Before his day , dancing in musical shows had been done by young ladies who wore short pink skirts and did traditional ballet steps , while the chorus was the chorus of a second rate grand opera  --  it merely stood around and sang . One of Mr. Tiller 's contributions to progress was the invention of the pony ballet . Hundreds have copied it , but it was Mr. Tiller 's Our last glimpse of Mr. Tiller was in the wings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whose premiere he had come to stay in Manhattan . He was a white and silken haired old gentleman who might have been mistaken for a benign , elderly manufacturer , or Dr. Frank Crane . Behind him was Mrs. Tiller , always at her husband 's side since Manchester and the days of their school for ballet which she helped to run there , so far as one can gather , along the lines of a model young ladies ' seminary . Each of the graduated troupes , as it went forth into the larger world , was chaperoned diligently , and the baccalaureate sermon was composed chiefly of warnings against the wicked ways of men . The Tiller Girls have been no mere dancing organization . They have been respectability rampant in the theatre . Origin MR . WALTER KINGSLEY , leading authority on Broadway 's chapters in the American language , has continued his research into the origin of the phrase , " Butter-andEgg-Man , " since he advised Mr. Franklin P. Adams that Miss Texas Guinan was responsible for its addition to the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way had been prepared for Broadway 's acceptance of the phrase by a certain Mr. Samuel Balcom , who supplies most of the larger restaurants and supper clubs with whatever dairy produce they require , and who , moreover , has been accustomed to entertaining . The scenes of these entertainments , naturally , were in the places which constituted Mr. Balcom 's clientele . And , also naturally , the-se many festive gatherings in public could not pass without inquiry as to the donor of the events . " Oh ; that 's our butter-and-egg man , " became the stock explanation of supper club proprietors and head waiters . And so , when Miss Guinan applied the expression generally to generous souls , the town was ready to accept it . Dogs ALONG with the contented smiles ALON possession of blue ribbons ) brought hack from the annual dog show at Germantown recently there was a sprinkling of bitter frowns , through which was discerned the anger of disillusionment . And those frowns were worn by ladies and gentlemen who , only ten days ago , were boasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wirehaired pinscher . They had brought back their beasts from Paris , where all the talk of the fancy concerns the wire hair . Learning that these animals cost from $300 to $4,000 each , the Americans naturally thought them desirable ; made purchases accordingly . But their consternation may be imagined when , after arriving at Germantown , they discovered that the wire-haired pinschers benched by the professional breeders bore not the slightest resemblance to the supposed wire hairs picked up abroad . Too late they had discovered that the Parisians , loathe to disappoint , had sold some sort of dog to every American asking for a pinscher . There are , the fanciers say , only a few more than a hundred real wirehaired pinschers in this country , of which perhaps two dozen are good enough to be benched . They further offer the news that the wire-haired specimen bears no honest relation to the larger doberman pinscher , and is a French dog only by a hasty naturalization. in a square at Stuttgart is a statute of der TY achtmarin , unveiled in if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast known nowadays as the wire-haired pinscher , though in those ancient times he was called a schnauzer . The German fancy waa preparing to develop the breed for export in 1914 , when the Imperial Staff disclosed other plans for the year . If you really want a wire-haired pinscher , to establish your corner in the mode , look for an animal that bears close resemblance to the wirehaired fox terrier , but somewhat larger . Before you purchase him , ask every dogman you know whether he is the genuine article .
