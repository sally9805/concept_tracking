A commission was formed to come to an agreement on the debts which France said Russia owed her and the reparations which Russia said France owed her . <P> Report from Paris had it that the commission recommended : 1 ) that Russia be asked to recognize 10,000,000,000 gold rubles ( $5,000,000,000 ) or about two-thirds of her debt to the <P> French ; -2 ) that a moratorium of ten years be granted in respect of principal and interest , provided that the back interest , amounting to 4,000,000,000 gold francs ( $800,000,000 ) be immediately paid . But , as France would accept paper instead of gold francs , the amount is cut by three-quarters . <P> There seemed small hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian bonds are held by a large number of French citizens and it is particularly difficult for any French Government , no matter how willing , to accept any arrangement with . Russia that does not eventually aim at repayment of these debts .
