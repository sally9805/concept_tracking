As a Canadian Sees Us ABOUT two years ago , when a brave aviator lay dying of pneumonia at a Quebec hospital , another aviator , Charles A. Lind ? bergh , made a last attempt to save his life by flying from New York with some special serum . This gallant effort proved unavailing : Floyd Bennett , who had flown down the St. Lawrence to suddenly-famous Greenley Island to succor the " Bremen 's " crew , died . The next evening , the Hon. L. A. Taschereau , Premier of the province of Quebec , speaking at a banquet in Montreal , made incidental reference to this episode . " What do they think we are , in the province of Quebec ? " he said , in effect . " A bar ? barous country ? Anti-pneumonia serum could easily have been procured at any of the world-renowned hospitals of Montreal . It could have been procured , even , at the very hospital in Quebec where Bennett was . The whole thing was a vulgar publicity stunt . " I happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wires , which was also the day that Floyd Bennett 's body was brought back . To say that the press of New York was astonished is to understate . Here , indeed , was the snake biting the man who had resuscitated it I Here was the good Samaritan receiving a hearty thwack over the crown from the poor wounded traveler he had en ? 4eavored to help ! Lindbergh 's sertun-flight wasnot vulgar , it was not publicity for any known per ? son , he took a special serum that only the New - York hospitals , of all this continent , possessed . And much more . Hurt ? They were stupefied . Yet , admitting the tartness of Mr. Taschereau 's comments , admitting that possibly the hospitals of Eastern Canada lacked that serum , the fact was obvious that most Canadians echoed ? in fact , rather rejoiced at ? the words of the Premier . They felt that what he said was in very bad taste , but that someone needed to say it . They resented the whole incident . Therein is demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States ; and also , unfortunately , therein lies the typical Canadian attitude toward the United States . If any other country had sent its own par ? ticular Lindbergh , you would have heard nothing but thunders of applause . The typical American , Heaven knows , is a com ? plex enough creature . His mental processes are amongst the most complicated on earth . He is , for instance , an exceedingly odd combination of indi ? vidualist and universalist . His surging ego , his tremendous ambition , have created the rich and wonderful United States that we know : yet ? sup ? posing , for example , that you advertise something for him to buy ? you find him the soonest persuaded , the easiest mass market , of any nationality . He is , December 4 , 1929 THE NEW in fact , a remarkable combination of sheep and eagle . But the typical Canadian is still more com ? plex . He , too , has this enormous ambition , with vast and undeveloped resources to color his brag ? gadocio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it he unites , at once , a simplicity reminiscent of the wide open spaces of the west and a sophistication tinged by deeper Old World sym ? pathies . Lust for power ? perplexity ? caution : there you have the Canadian . That is why he envies the pros ? perity of the United States , and yet damns that country up and down . In this , of course , lie ap ? proximates the European , who yells " Uncle Shy-lock " ( or " Bloody colonial I " if the object of deri ? sion happens to be a visiting Canadian ) but scram ? bles for the overseas dollar . But the Canadian par ? takes also of the enormous heritage of the Amer ? ican . His country has much the same physical char ? acteristics ; his people have much the same mental characteristics . In temperament , outlook , speech , he is much nearer the American than the European . Yet he dislikes the American . When I say " dislikes , " I do not , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , a certain percentage of Canadians who actually accumulate venom to ? ward the American , and who lose no opportunity of venting it . But that percentage is numerically in ? finitesimal , and can be matched by a corresponding " anti " or " phobe " element toward some specified nationality in any country you can name , as , for instance , Senator Borah hates the French nation . The average Canadian attitude is " dislike " in the sense of there being a complete absence of liking . I have no illusions about my countrymen . They are often wild and woolly . They comprise many small-town minds , and a great many political tousle-heads . But in their attitude towards the United States there is an extraordinary unanimity . " Amer ? ican " means something to be on one 's guard against . If it came to a showdown between the United States and another nation ? another American nation , at any rate ? they would probably wish that other na ? tion to win ; just as , in a two-club baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sooner root for an outside club to come in and clean up their hated rivals than they would root for the latter . Now , if there is one thing which gives the aver ? age Canadian more delight than anything else , it is to lecture the American . Perhaps he is too prone to do this ; but he feels especially qualified . His geographical and temperamental proximity give him , he thinks , unusual opportunities for knowing the United States . He may not understand the United States , but it is not the mental cloud-burst to him that it is to the visiting lecturer or impressionist from the other side of the Atlantic . He is neither ' dazzled nor frightened by the vastness of " the States , " and he needs no interpreter to grasp the language or aspirations of the common people UN1VE.RSITY OF k , Ft:LAP. , blab &; CsWECIAIA therein . And , if you add to this , that the typical Canadian feels that the United States is an oppres ? sive factor in his life , that every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving tit for tat ? " getting his own back " ? you will realize why pot ? shotting the United States is the Canadian 's favor ? ite sport . Perhaps the pot-shots are only playful ones ; but often they arise from exasperation . The abysmal carelessness of the average American in petty inter ? national relationships causes some of this irritation ? such trifling things as enclosing a stamped ad ? dressed envelope in a letter to a Canadian , bearing United States stamps , which happens hundreds of times per week . I was once secretary of a club affiliated with a large American association ; fre ? quently I would receive letters urging me to write to my congressman about something , or to help the United States ' export trade . The Canadian is n't so poor , of course , that he can not provide his own stamps , and he is sensible enough to make allow ? ances for the careless supervision of a mailing list ; but he himself seldom commits such a minor blunder when he communicates with an American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into whom ? possibly because export trade is taught practically in the cradle ? there is early drilled a better knowledge of how to handle foreign mail . Anti-American feeling based on any count weight ? ier than these trifles has , I think , two main conten ? tions : the United States is Americanizing Canada ; and the United States is squeezing Canada . Either of these , you may say , is ridiculous ; but read any Canadian newspaper , even the most con ? servative , for any short period , and you will find one or the other openly or subtly expressed . Travel in Canada , and you will be received with the utmost cordiality and hospitality , and not always because of your tourist 's dollars , which to Canada nowa ? days are a highly important economic asset ; but all the time you will receive the impression that the people are glad to see you so that they can make you understand and sympathize with their case . And to the credit of our American visitors , it should be added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our problems . You can say , of course , that we are hyper-sensi ? tive . Almost every small nation is that ? we being a small nation because of sparse population , al though huge in territory ? especially when it is dominated by an aggressive next-door neighbor . It sees affronts in every innocent move and fears it is going to be gobbled up . Our people have been through an attack of the inferiority complex . Per ? haps , if we had been as successful as we had hoped a few years ago , there would not have been so much of this inferiority complex . About two decades ago Sir Wilfrid Laurier , then Prime Minister of Ca ? nada , made the confident prediction that " the nine ? teenth century belongs to the United States , but the twentieth century belongs to Canada . " But having passed the first quarter of " our " century , we find his anticipations far from realized ; and that , on the contrary , this second quarter belongs , as its open ? ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada was experiencing the flood tide of an enormous immigration ? not only from Europe , but from the United States as well . Railroads were being built at a rapid rate , town-sites by the hundreds were being launched every ' ear , a huge industrial development seemed obvious . Optimism and boosterism filled the air . But war brought a swift reversal . We fought for four years , sent 8 percent of our total population overseas , and loaded ourselves up with war - debts on a scale un ? equalled in the United States . You had no really serious aftermath of war ; we did . Our develop ? ment , which " flopped " in 1914 , did not recover in the industrial revival and surge of mass production as yours did . As you entered this unparalleled wave of prosperity , we just about kept our heads above water . Immigrants stopped coining ; or , if they did , they used our country merely as a boarding house en route to the United States . Our own people , attracted by your extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers themselves . The net increase in our population , from the census year 1911 to the census year 1921 , which period covered , as well as the War , the amazingly large immigration of 1911-14 , was 1,581,841 , or 22 percent . But after the War , from the census year 1921 to the 1927 government estimate , the net increase was only 600,817 ? less than 7 percent . During this period 811,340 immigrants entered Canada , so that somewhere the country actually lost some 210,523 people . Do you wonder , therefore , that when we look across the border we feel covet ? ous ? I admit , of course , that the pendulum shows indications , if not actually of swinging the other way , at least of wavering . Emigration from Ca ? nada to the United States is a little more hesitant ; but we can not jubilate if it is because industry in the United States is hesitant too . Our sad experi ? ence has ever been that a boom in the United States takes several months to benefit Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bogey of Americanization has its roots in envy . We envy your prosperity , and most of all when you scratch around for export markets for your overproduction , and unload your surplus on us . Our own manufacturers very often find it tough sledding to produce for and distribute to our own much smaller market ; but when they are faced by the competition of your mass production , and are not at all helped by a tariff which , like your own , is a political football , you ca n't blame them for yell ? ing " Americanization I " We like your goods , and buy them on merit ; but our own do not get a fair chance . Yours are so much better because you manufacture on so vast a scale . The most powerful selling force you have in Canada for American-made goods , if you only knew it , is the triumphant American magazine , which is so good and so cheapthat no Canadian periodical , produced for a nine . million country instead of a 115-million country , can ever hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the chief thing that put your goods over to our customers . Commercial penetration is inevitably followed by cultural penetration . It probably always was . It may be a misnomer to call the popular American magazine and the American film " culture " ; but these two things , in particular , exercise a powerful influence in shaping thought , especially of the younger generation . The more rabid anti-Amer ? icans do not cease from agitating for an embargo . or a prohibitive tariff . Were Canada bigger , could it produce its own magazines or films on a twenty ? five-million or fifty-million basis , were its film ex ? changes and its newsstands not in the grip of com ? bines dictated by American capital , the situation would not be so acute ; but at the present , however desirous it is of putting up a stiff competitive fight , it can not . And inasmuch as the American magazine or the American movie is not characterized by any partic ? ular inferiority complex , and inasmuch as the vast mass of readers or theater-goers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter rapidly absorb na ? tional sentiments which the pro-Canadian thinks are wrong . The blatancy of the American war-film , for example , was ? and is , with its recent revival ? such that the younger Canadian audience , who were in rompers during the war period , are left in con ? siderable doubt whether Canada ever took part in the great conflict . The irony is that the United States is full of Canadian artists , writers and actors of talent , who might have stayed home if they could have made a decent living , but who are forced by our very narrow market and smaller financial returns to seek a wider market . Sometimes their work comes back to us ? as American I What is " Americanization , " anyway ? To me , a Canadian , studying the fulminations of American politicians , it seems largely now a matter of being anti-European . I read a fine saying attributed to Theodore Roosevelt , that " no man is a time Amer ? ican who hates another country more than he loves his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to make political capital out of racial hatred ? and especially to inflame the Irish and the German vote against Great Britain ? is not a very edifying spectacle . I and 89.87 percent of my countrymen , according to the 1921 census , are of British stock , included in which are about 27 per ? cent French-Canadians , who have lived under British rule for 170 years and who admire and prefer British political institutions . Over one-sixth of us ( 11.66 percent of the total population ) were actually born in the British Isles . It does not in ? spire us with any respect for " Americanization " to see that it contains so frank an element of anti-British feeling ; we would all have been ready , if King George V had asked us , to join an expedition against Mayor Thompson of Chicago . Heaven knows that we all , in this country , love to " take a wallop " at Great Britain . " Downing Street " is a real bogey to our nationalistic politicians . Downing Street , probably , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , and ac ? cepting an American Minister at Ottawa , but might have preferred that we should continue diplomatic relations through the old roundabout channel of the British and American ambassadors to Washington and London . It probably did not like our insistence upon being a sovereign treaty-making nation . But it acquiesced . It had to . London is as remote now in our political life as Tokio . But we have not yet reached the point where , to show our Can ? adianism , we find it essential to denounce and vilify Great Britain . And as regards non-British people , numbering some 10 percent-odd of our population , I find them singularly free from any hatred of either Great Britain or of the country which gave them birth . To my mind , this is due primarily to the reason that we have n't succeeded in putting them through any " melting pot " process . We have n't tried to force Canadianism ? whatcver that is ? down their throats . Now we can turn to the fear that the United States is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian viewpoint of Uncle Sam is of a gigantic and powerful personage with imperialistic cravings , who has developed his own natural re ? sources to the point where depletion is in sight and who casts covetous eyes at the rich but unexploited resources of Canada and Mexico . Such resources he intends to possess , by fair means or foul . Typical of this imperialistic attitude are these : i . In selling American goods to Canadian consum ? ers , many American manufacturers refuse to establish Canadian plants or to use Canadian advertising . 2 . Although Canadian money is practically at par in New York ( being on this day that I write at a dis ? count of only one thirty-second of i percent ) , and although American money is accepted unhesitatingly in Canada , American storekeepers and hotels and even American banks discount the Canadian tourist 's money at from 2 to TO percent . 3 . In the matter of the " movies , " American capital has secured control of the cinema business in Canada , and refuses to let British-made or French-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States disregards international treat-ties , as , for example , it disregards the protest made by Canada that the Chicago River water diversion takes almost twice as much water from Lake Michigan as the treaty allows , this " steal " having the effect of seriously lowering the levels of Lakes Eric and On ? tario and the St. Lawrence River . 5 . The United States is holding a big stick over Canada in the matter of the St. Lawrence Waterway . The last instance is worth enlarging upon . The creation of a deep sea waterway from Lake Ontarioto Montreal is a huge project that may or may not be advantageous to commerce . The attitude in Canada toward it was until recently the reflection of where one lived ; east of Toronto everyone was against it , because it seemed to suggest that the ports of Montreal and Quebec would lose business . In Toronto most were for it , partly because it would injure Montreal ; in points west as far as the Rockies , it seemed to imply lower freight rates on export grain . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparently unseemly haste of the United States to commence the project has tended to crystallize unanimous feeling against it . Canada has , after all , the major interest in the St. Lawrence River , but the United States would bene ? fit most . Canada has its own commercial problems to solve ? why , then , should Canada go to enormous expense to benefit the commerce of the United States ? Latterly , indeed , there has arisen in Can ? ada a new form of antagonism , which holds that the St. Lawrence Waterway is only a camouflage for power development , and that the United States in ? tends to grab all the resulting power . Premier Taschereau of Quebec , already quoted in reference to Lindbergh , has been the leading antagonist of the export of power ; although the published corre ? spondence between Secretary of State Kellogg and the Canadian Minister in Washington seemed to have developed much the same attitude in the Hon. Vincent Massey . If you want to get a Canadian really and truly angry , you can adopt no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary as " that invisible line . " One hears that platitude at banquets , and on occasions when Rotarians get together ; and to the Canadian it always preludes another " squeeze . " He retorts that , physically speaking , the line is not invisible either way to the customs and immigration officials , nor to the Hon. Vincent Massey nor the Hon. William Phillips , U. S. Minister at Ottawa . He is as keen for world peace as any man , but he is no sharer in the belief that you will get it by pooh-poohing the national consciousness of other races , or by blah-blahing those races with Grand Rapids or Detroit oratory to the effect that we are all ? cheers and weeping I ? members of one human family trying to get along , in order to sell them more Grand Rapids furniture or more Detroit au ? tomobiles . That is why the Canadian , although his political future is a puzzle , is no adherent of Pan-American-ism . He does not , I think , have much conception of what Pan-Americanism is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States to control the trade of the Pacific Ocean ; but the fact that the United States is for it leads Canada , I am afraid , to be almost automatically " agin it . " Canada takes rather a delight in " being agin " anything the United States is for ; and it even sympathizes with those Southern states ? where Canadians , as I know from experience , are very popular ? which still carry the grudge of the ' sixties against the Union . So , having talked to you United States like Roosevelt 's very polite but very insistent Dutch uncle , I can only add that if these views were held by me alone they would be worth just that ; but un ? fortunately there is good reason to believe that they are held by a very large majority of my country ? men who were born here ? who number 78 per per ? cent of our people ? and by practically all our British-born immigrants . WILLIAM YORK .. At the Shrine NO ONE knows just how they started , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown priest in the Holy Cross Cem ? etery at Malden . But , since the first newspaper pub ? licity , there has been an almost continual stream of the faithful along the gravel path that leads to the " shrine , " thousands have thrown themselves pros ? trate upon the grave , rubbed themselves with its cov ? ering loam , anointed themselves with holy water and left behind offerings of silver and gold . Crip ? pled and diseased , old and young , rich and poor , in sun and rain , day and night , tens of thousands of them have come to join the endless file beneath the leafless trees and past the semi-Gothic chapel where the prayers are said . Father Patrick Power has been dead for sixty years . While he lived he was little known ? an ob ? scure priest who never had a parish of his own . Thirty years after his death , so the story goes , the grass on his grave remained green when all around it was yellow and dying . Candles placed upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went out . The grave took on a special significance and once or twice cures were reported to have happened there . But the rank and file of the faithful knew nothing about it , and only those who heard about it in a casual way went there to do homage . Three weeks ago a tabloid newspaper resurrected the story of the grave 's strange , uncanny power ; it told of cures of the af ? flicted reported there ; the story spread to the front pages of the Boston press until such a wave of re ? ligious hysteria as has never been known before in Massachusetts has brought fully eight hundred thousand people in the past three weeks into the cemetery to fall on their knees and kiss the obscure grave of the unknown priest . Twice has Cardinal William O'Connell visited the grave , and the report is current that the ma ? chinery of the Church has been started toward mak ? ing the Malden grave a shrine on a par with St. Anne de Beaupre and with Lourdes . But , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen in this century such an overwhelming outpour ? ing of maimed and crippled , diseased and idiot , seeking to regain their health from the supernatural . Darkness had fallen when I boarded the street car in the dismal elevated terminal at Everett . There was no need to ask the way . One followedthe crowd . Irish , Italians , French Canucks , Ameri ? cans , white , black ? a motley mixture of races with Irish predominating ? were heading towards the shrine . Extra cars were being run out into the out ? skirts of Malden where the graveyard is . On my car an ancient crone , a crippled girl , an idiot boy with his plodding Irish father and care-worn mother , a young couple , well dressed and well fed , stood out from the mediocrity of the others . None of them smiled , and on the faces of all these hopefuls who were going to offer prayers for themselves , and for others , perhaps , who could not go themselves , there was stamped a dumb , appealing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall off their bodies , that withered limbs would strengthen and be straight , that eyes used to darkness would see again. , that minds would assume intelligence and that health would come to them all . Silent as cattle they sat there , and no one minded his neighbor . The car jerked its way along , through the brighter lights of Everett Square , out of the dark thoroughfare . None got off ; it was as if it had been a special car sent only to carry the pilgrims . Finally it stopped , and one knew one was at last at Holy Cross . As far as one could see , on either side of the street , cars were parked . Hundreds of others were looking for a space . Policemen , im ? bued with a suspicious courtesy , guided the faithful across the street . By the iron gate that bars the way of automobiles ? except those which arrive in quick succession bearing the maimed and the para ? lyzed ? police herd the growing crowd into two lines . Two single files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graves , and reach at the end the spot where Father Power lies . Strong men guide ancient women who hobble painfully along . Young toughs mingle with the crowds and try to look less hard than usual . A mother carries a baby , its lifeless legs dangling like a doll 's legs from beneath its little skirts . A toil-bent laborer staggers a bit ; a little girl leads a woman who can not see her way ; two boys push a twisted , tortured paralytic wreck in a wheel chair ; a gibbering idiot is carefully led along by his har ? assed but faithful mother ; one man , his face all sores like the face of Lazarus , slumps down into the collar of his coat . The ground is drying from an afternoon of rain and the wind is chill . A moon sheds light palely on the gravelled walk , shines in
