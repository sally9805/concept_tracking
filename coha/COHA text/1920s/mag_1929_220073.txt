Last week , while George V , dreadfully thin and pale , lay watching white fingers of frost on his window pane at Bognor . Edward of Wales , acting for the King-Emperor , conducted his first state levee . <P> With admirable tact H. R. H. cited a light snowfall as his excuse for not riding ceremoniously from Buckingham Palace to St. James 's Palace in the ornate state coach . The Prince lives in York House , which is really one wing of the intricate collection of buildings that make up St. James 's Palace . He had been expected to motor to Buckingham Palace and ride back in the state coach . Instead , he merely clapped on his head an enormous , extinguisher-like fur busby of the Welsh Guards , and walked round the corner , unescorted , from York House to St. James 's proper . <P> DQueen Mary , accompanied by Princess Mary and the 60-year-old Princess Victoria , the King 's sister , descended at Bognor upon the local Woolworth 's threepenny and sixpenny shop . <P> Feeling perhaps that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all suitable for a very tired invalid , Her Majesty sought the sixpenny book counter , picked out The Hundredth Chance by Ethel M. Dell ; also four of prolific Edgar Wallace 's blood-drenched thrillers : The Flying Fifty-Five , The Missing Million , Room 13 and A King by Night . She bought a thrip'ny rubber sponge and a thripiny packet of nail polish . <P> DSold in Berlin by a heartless auctioneer was a letter written by the Queen-Empress when she was just Princess Mary of Teck . It was written in 1893 , shortly after the death of her first fiance , the Duke of Clarence , and her engagement to his younger brother , the present George V. " The last year has been such a terribly sad one for me , " wrote the 26-year-old princess . " It almost seems strange that any kind of happiness could come into my life again . But Georgie is such a dear . The great sorrow we shared has made our bond a union that nothing can break . " <P> DIn Bognor village a carpenter stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall . Glancing casually down under his arm , he was aghast to see his Queen . Her Majesty had just entered with Princess Mary in search of gifts for a charity bazaar . The carpenter , anxious to show respect , tried to doff his cap , but only succeeded in knocking it off . Grabbing for it , he dropped his hammer . The hammer struck his saw , lying on a board , and all crashed to the floor with a great clatter of ironmongery . In an agony of mortification , the carpenter fell off the counter himself . <P> Springing up , he bowed deeply . The Queen bowed . The shopkeeper rushed forward nervously babbling , " I-I trust- that-that Your Majesty will pardon-all this-all this noise . " <P> Queen Mary made sure that the carpenter was unhurt . <P> " As for the noise he made , " said she right royally , " we liked it . "
