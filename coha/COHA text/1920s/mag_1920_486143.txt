T7ie Ten Books on Architecture . Translated by Morris Micky Morgan . Cambridge : Harvard University Press . $3.50 net . - The name of Vitruvius is familiar to all students of architecture , and to many who have but a superficial knowledge of this subject , but his writings are known to few ; and this new translation of his ten books on Architecture , in attractive form , will be welcomed by many within and without the profession . Although some doubts have been cast upon its authorship and the-date of its production , the book is now generally conceded to have been written by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio during the reign of Augustus Caesar , to whom it is dedicated . That the text has been preserved to us is without doubt due to the fact that it contains in the third , fourth , and fifth of its ten books certain rules for the proportioning of the plans , and de- , tails of design and construction of temples , and other columnar structures , which rules its author professes to have gained bystudy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other seven books contain nothing of value to the architect ; and these three indeed give us no Just picture of the working methods of the real Greek and Roman architects , but rather of those of the mechanical copyist who , failing of inventive ability , seeks to reduce all design to definite formulae . Such men live in all ages ; and that they lived in Greece is evidenced by the sources from which Vitruvius drew his own rules . That they abounded in Rome is clear from the fact that Vitruvius thought it worth while to write the book before us ; but this fact must not be allowed to strengthen the all too common view that no real creative architects lived among the Romans ; the falsity of such a notion being shown in the ruined works they have left to us , which display a remarkable fund of imagination and inventiveness in the development of the forms inherited from Greece That Vitruvius himself was one of these plodding copyists seems probable from his own statements , one of which ( p. 168 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full : For my part , Cmsar , I have never been eager to make money by my art , but have gone on the principle that slender means and a good reputation are preferable to wealth and disrepute For this reason , only a little celebrity has followed ; but still , my hope is that , with the publication of these books , I shall become known even to posterity , And it is not to be wondered at that I am so generally unknown . Other architects go about and ask for opportunities to practice their profession ; but I have been taught by my instructors that it is the proper thing to undertake a charge only after being asked , and not to ask for it ; since a gentleman will blush with shame at petitioning for a thing that arouses suspicion . It is in fact those who can grant favors that are courted , not those who receive them What are we to think must be the suspicions of a man who is asked to allow Ius Private means to be expended in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing is to be done for the profit and advantage of that individual ? Little could Vitruvius in his wildest dreams have imagined that in a continent then undiscovered , and after nineteen centuries , his name would still be known . Little did he appreciate the fact that the evils he deplores in the passage just quoted were grounded in human nature , and that they would persist even to our time . How little human nature has changed durnig this lapse of centuries is shown again in another instructive passage ( p. 231 ) : In the famous and important Greek city of Ephesus there is said to be an ancient ancestral law , the terms of which are severe , but its justice is not inequitable . When an architect accepts the charge of a public work , he has to promise what the cost of it will be . His estimate is handed to the magistrate , and his property is pledged as security until the work is done . . . Would to God that this were also a law of the Roman people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the ignorant would no longer run riot with impunity , but men who are well qualified by an exact scientific training would unquestionably adopt the profession of architecture . Gentlemen would not be misled into limitless and prodigal expenditure , even to eJectments from their estates , and the architects themselves could be forced , by fear of the penalty , to be more careful in calculating and stating the limit of expense , so that gentlemen would procure their buildings for that which they had expected , or by adding only a little more It has been remarked above that all but three of the ten books composing the volume are valueless to the architect ; - but this does not imply that they are without great worth as a human document . It is indeed most fortunate that the practical use of these-three books led to the preservation of the remaining seven ; for these latter give us an intensely interesting picture of Vitruvius himself , and a suggestive indication of the characteristics of the society in which he lived . He was evidently a man of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patronage of Augustus and of his sister , Octavia Minor . His remarks concerning himself show that he had received what at that time was a very liberal education , that he was thoroughly familiar with Greek , and was a great reader . A sidelight is thus thrown upon the nature of the training given to the men of social position in his time . It did not include any compulsory drill in the art of composition ; for , as is noted in the translator 's preface , the author was certainly " not a great literary personage ; ambitious as he was to appear in that character . " His style is turgid and pompous , and " at times his meaning is ambiguous , not because of grammatical faults , . . . but because , when he does attempt a periodic sentence , he becomes involved , and finds it difficult to extricate himself . " This is sufficiently illustrated in the passages quoted above ; for the translator deliberately imitated the author 's Peculiarities and crudities of expression , " beea-Use of his conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book , but should also give as clear a Picture as possible of the original , of its author , and of the working of his mind . " He exhibits himself as a man of inordinate conceit who has gained from his broad reading a smattering of many branches of the learning of his day of which he makes a great display , especially in long introductions which generally deal with matters quite irrelevant to the subjects treated in the books they introduce . Men of his type are , of course , familiar to us in our time , but they are seldom able to leave a record of their conceptions and modes of thought . Here , however , we have such a record , and one that , being published under imperial patronage , may be assumed to have met with no serious disapprobation from those of the author 's social position . And if such . an assumption is warranted , the average " gentleman and scholar " of the Augustan era must have been an astonishingly crude thinker . His professional work naturally led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in this he shows a superficiality that is truly astonishing It is impossible to believe that the Romans could have constructed the vast and noble works built in his day had they been de ? , pendent for direction upon architects of the type of our author . To accomplish what they did must have required great and ac ? curate knowledge ; but this , it would seem , must have been hidden from the architects , as trade secrets of the guilds . But our author deals with many subjects far removed from his constructional inter ests , giving us explanations of the nature of different materials , of natural phenomena , of the activities of the body , and of the diversities of the mental and physical traits of men , all being based upon the most absurd hypotheses which can not possibly have been en ? tertained by the really learned men of his day . The book is beautifully printed and appropriately illustrated . Professor Morgan died before the completion of the translation of the last four chapters of the tenth book , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preface above referred to ; the whole work being prepared under the direction of Prof. H. Langford Warren . " The Inner Life of the Royal Academy , " by G F. Leslie ( Dutton , illustrated ; $3 50 net ) , is a mine of anecdote and reminiscence For forty-six years Mr. Leslie has been sealed of the academic tribe , and for more than twenty years earlier he had the run of the varnishing days as his father 's son It is something to have seen Turner put the final flourishes on Rain , Steam and Speed , and to tell of it well Mr. Leslie pretty well reveals the secrets of the prison house He tells how the schools are managed , they still have the absurdity of a new teacher every month ; how the pictures are judged and hung , about the family sociabilities of varnishing day , and the greater state of Royal views and Academy dinners The conduct of the Chantrey bequest is defended The precious possessions of the Academy are enumerated , but without mention of the lovely cartoon of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an oil painting , a minor affair from the academic point of view . Generally speaking , one has rather the sense of being among jolly people than among great artists as one runs over the pages , and of course such is the case Mr Leslie has a shrewd sense for a good quip or an anecdote , but not much vividness as a characterizer . Yet there is something graphic enough in the hint of Leighton 's olympian if always genial aloofness . It was Leighton , according to Mr. Leslie , who introduced an unhappy Continental strain into the pure British tradition . Thus the old , beloved , free-selling picture with a story was discredited , to the detriment of the British artist and public . One is agreeably surprised to read of G ? rOnae that ( before Whistler had discovered London ) " he astonished us by expressing his admiration for the foggy gloom of the London streets , he wondered Why we did not introduce it into our paintings " Very interesting is the description of Turner 's carrying his canvases to exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly painted and fully dried canvases ready . These had a " delicate effect , almost in monochrome , and very beautiful they looked , often like milky ghosts . " These , once hung , he proceeded to bedevil with the brightest and most treacherous colors in his tubes Such eleventh-hour painting , in Mr. Leslie 's opinion , has spoiled and changed . All the exhibited canvases are wrecks , and might as well be thrown away . The remarkable pictures lately put into the Tate Gallery are of a different sort " The safest and simplest pigments alone were used . If I ani right in my conjecture , we ought to be thankful that they never were exhibited , for , if this had been the case , they would , most likely , have by this time been ruined by the deleterious pigments with which he would have overlaid them on the varnishing days . " Such a view helps to explain the dismay that many a reader of " Modern Painters " has felt on entering the Turner Room in the National Gallery . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which may be enjoyed even by those who do not wholly share his confidence in the best possible Academy in the best possible world . " British Painters , their Story and their Art , " by J Edgcumbe Staley ( Stokes , $1 75 net ) , is an odd combination of a catalogue and a sustained rhapsody . All British artists look alike good to the author Analogies fly to his pen . Hogarth 's Shrimp Girl is the English Mona Lisa This constant unmodulated outpouring of professional enthusiasm grows very tiresome in the end , and it is hardly redeemed by the two dozen color plates of mediocre execution which the text enshrines In " The Study of Modern Painting " ( The Century Co , $2 net , illustrated ) , Margaret Steele Anderson makes a rapid survey of the art in Europe and America , and arrives at the conclusion that a decorative-idyllic tendency is the modern note . The chapters are clearly written and judicious , but the whole thing makes the impression of a result not attained vividly before pictures but excerpted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for the following observations on Brangwyn : " Brangwyn has been likened to Mantegna , but the likeness is only occasional . He is certainly descended from Venice , however , with something of the splendid Turner . He has little of the effect of the pallid Chavannes , though evidently learning from that innovator , " etc . It is fair to add that the book is better than so sapient an extract would indicate , and that it may be helpful to those whose ill-assorted information and admirations , need a very elementary putting in order " An Idler in Spain , the Record of a Goya Pilgrimage " ( McBride , Nast : $2 net ) , by J. E Crawford Flitch , deals as much with Spain as with Goya . Mr. Flitch is a capital traveller of the enthusiastic and impressionable type , and whether he discusses morning coftee at Barcelona , the soul of Goya 's Zaragoza , or particular pictures , is always entertaining . Much good criticism is interwoven , and perhaps rather lost , in the general whimsicality . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more briefly than this : " The violent and the tragic fascinated him necauso in violence and tragedy life is usually raised to a higher power . " In a pretty careful description of the religious wall paintings which , sadly restored , still remain in the Carthusian Aula Dei , near Zaragoza , Mr. Flitch makes a distinct contribution . It is the first consistent account of early works that had become nearly legendary . His defence of the more than secular decorations of San Antonio de la Florida is more specious than convincing . The book is always stimulating , perhaps just a little over-vivacious , as is natural in an avowed devotee of Hilaire Belloc . It will be read with interest by lovers of idiomatic Spain . There are eight illustrations after Goya. - Finance THE PAST FINANCIAL YEAR . In the last two weeks of last January , there occurred on the markets a movement so emphatic in its character , and so worldwide in its scope , as to lead in many quarters to the inference that an unmistakable drift of financial affairs in 1914 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , where the bank rates , long kept at high figures because of uneasiness as to international relations after the Balkan War , were reduced in a way almost sensational . These reductions occurred at London , Berlin , Paris , Brussels , Austria , Sweden , Norway , and Switzerland . Some of the banks made two or three reductions . All of them went to the lowest rates established since the Balkan states , in the autumn of 1912 , invaded Turkey . And along with this worldwide expression of confidence at the banks , the stock markets rose violently . German Government bonds advanced 4 points , British consols 814 , French rentes 2 , Austrian bonds 21/2 . Other stocks at Berlin , Paris , and London moved up even more rapidly . On the New York Stock Exchange , with the largest trading in two years , prices rose 6 to 11 points . Wall Street called it " the first bull market since the panic . " To this day , nobody knows exactly what it was that caused so sudden ( and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first five weeks of 1914 . Neither the " White Paper " nor the " Yellow Paper " nor the " Orange Paper " gives the slightest hint of any sudden turn to diplomatic optimism at that time . Yet , if the storm-clouds of European war had actually blown away , it is not at all improbable that the enthusiastic January rise on the New York Stock Exchange would have been pointed out , at this present time , as the correct harbinger of financial conditions , in the United States at any rate , during the rest of 1914 . When one now takes account of stock as to the year 's actual results in financial America  --  if one can disregard the war and its influences , and measure other achievements as they would have been measured in an ordinary year  --  the story is rather impressive . A wheat crop in the United States larger by 127,600,000 bushels than the previous high-record crop of the year before , and coming when the rest of the world 's production was 361,600,000 bushels less than in 1913 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other grains than wheat 274,000,000 bushels above last year . A new banking system introduced in the United States , which automatically released some $300,000,000 of reserve money . And as a condition precedent to these numerous notable contributions to reviving prosperity , there was the policy , long pursued on the Stock Exchange , in our producing industries , in the providing of stocks of goods on merchants ' shelves , and in the conducting of general business  --  a policy characterized by strict economy , conservative values , close margin of supplies , and total absence of speculation . It would not require a very bold stretch of fancy to imagine  --  if the German Government had chosen to stop Austria from throwing her torch into the powder-barrel  --  an autumn of great American prosperity . After the interval of financial nightmare , since that January demonstration , we are just now beginning to understand what was the meaning of all these underlying conditions of 1914 in the United States itself , even with the world 's financial and commercial relations shattered by the European catastrophe . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of all the world to open for free trading ; with prices , in spite of reaction from their highest level , holding above the closing quotations of July 30 ; with money easy , after all our huge gold shipments to meet Europe 's abnormal requisitions on us , and yet with the foreign exchanges moving emphatically in favor of this country  --  all this , in its way , is quite as strong testimony to the intrinsic strength of the American position as was the demonstration on the stock market last January . If there had been no war , and no perpetual threat of war , it is probable that a review of the governing influences of 1914 in American finance would be made up of the year 's extraordinary agricultural good fortune , of the new demand which had sprung up in every manufacturing industry in the autumn , of the great expansion in our export trade , recovery on the investment markets , and of the general movement of prosperity . As it is , the year 's financial history in this country will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock of the European war was met , the straightforwardness with which we settled the foreign indebtedness that suddenly called for payment , and the immediate discovery of the extent to which Europe had to depend on the United States for its materials and necessaries of life . As to whether , without the outbreak of European war at the opening of August , we should have had an autumn of really great ; financial and industrial revival  --  on that point , opinions will doubtless always differ . The materials were present ; but they were also present in the autumn of 1913 , when every favorable material influence was superseded by the apprehensions of coming war . This leaves the question open , whether the events of August were or were not the inevitable sequel to the events of 1911 and 1913 , and whether the avoiding of war in 1914 would merely have meant postponement , with financial misgiving and agitation continued until the day of reckoning should arrive . Historians will debate that question from now to the end of time ; for , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no conclusive answer will ever be possible .
