Vice-Admiral Sir Reginald Yorke Tyrwhitt had ample excuse to indulge , last week , in an honest , becoming sailor 's blush . He will shortly have assigned to him as his flagship the new British post-Washington Treaty cruiser Suffolk . Strictly speaking the Suffolk , when empty of stores , water , fuel and ammunition , just comes within the Treaty limitation of 10,000 tons . But in the building of the Suffolk thousands of parts have been made of aluminum , where use of a heavier metal would have been standard practice . Judged from the standpoint of fighting strength , the 10,000-ton Suffolk probably outrates an ordinary 13,000 tonner <P> Last week , amid deadly secrecy , the Suffolk was inspected for the first time by civilians , when three Cabinet members and 150 M. P. 's went aboard . The Admiralty , shrewd to the last , decreed that the torpedo rooms , and gun control stations should be locked and all instrument panels covered with concealing canvas .                @ @ @ @ @
