Nominee Hoover took an afternoon off and went to a ball game . It was the New York " Yankees , " American League leaders , visiting the Washington " Senators . " The Nominee sat himself down in Club-President Clark Griffith 's box-the box where Presidents sit at Washington ball games . He was scarcely conscious of an event which feature-writers made into the sensation of the day . <P> Cameramen had obtained the Nominee 's consent to pose with George Herman ( " Babe " ) Ruth , famed rightfielder of the New York team . But when the cameramen went to fetch Fielder Ruth , he declined . " It 's a matter of politics , " he was reported to have said . <P> <P> Club-President Griffith was shocked . <P> " I am at a loss to explain such conduct , " he said . Ruth 's manager , Miller Huggins , tried to explain that the game had begun just as Ruth was sent for . But the feature-writers feature-wrote just the same . <P> It was news almost as ideal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera-shy and posing with other celebrities has been Fielder Ruth 's routine for years . What no writer ventured to mention as a possible explanation , aside from professional jealousy and personal politics , was that the man who , as owner of the Yankees , contracts for Fielder Ruth 's services , is Col. Jacob Ruppert , onetime beer-brewer . " If Babe Ruth ever posed with any Dry , " said a fan , " Jake Ruppert 'd slap a fine on him quicker'n you can say ' three strikes . ' " <P> The episode assumed such proportions that it was thought necessary for Fielder Ruth to issue a statement : <P> " When a photographer asked me to go to Mr. Hoover 's box yesterday , I labored under a misunderstanding and deeply regret that I did not avail myself of the opportunity of meeting him . I hope Mr. Hoover will be gracious enough at some future time to permit me to present myself to him . " <P> Then Nominee Hoover issued a statement saying : " I learned of the incident only from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting to hold up the game for more photographs . <P> " As an earnest baseball devotee I long have admired Babe Ruth 's batting ability and I look forward with pleasure to meeting him . " <P> Nominee Hoover 's next campaign speech was announced for September 14 , in a Newark , N. J. , armory . Subject : Labor .
