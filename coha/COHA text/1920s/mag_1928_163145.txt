Games involving money amuse some people . A new money game current last fortnight was played by many people somewhat as follows : <P> First player- " Name the Treasurer of the United States . " <P> Second player- " Andrew Mellon . " <P> First player ( jubilantly ) - " Wrong . " <P> Second- " Oh , I know . Calvin Coolidge . " <P> First ( chortling ) - " Wrong again . Ho Ho !

" <P> Second- " Well , now let 's see . . . . But Andrew Mellon is too Treasurer . " <P> First- " No , he 's Secretary of the Treasury . Why do n't you look in your pocket ? " <P> Second- " In my pocket ? How do you mean ? " <P> First- " Have n't you got something signed by the Treasurer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Second ( fumbling ) - " My income tax blank you mean ? " <P> First- " No , a certificate for something the Government owes you . Something you can collect on .

White , President Coolidge nominated for promotion Assistant Treasurer H. Theodore Tate , another Tennesseean . Figuratively speaking , Mr. Tate picked up the pen laid down by Col. White and upon a large white sheet of paper executed his own autograph in huge script . The signature was sent to the photo-engraver to be reduced and reproduced upon new Federal currency . Mr. Tate would not let people see how he had signed his name until after his confirmation by the Senate .
