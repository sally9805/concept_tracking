There were about 20,000 people in the quiet stands ; a cold rain dripped from the smutty sky and early autumn mist closed in around Meadow Brook . Airplanes rose suddenly from invisible fields and flew low across the enormous billiard table of turf ; a Scoreboard said " Argentine-6 ; U. S.-6 . " The gong sounded for the eighth chukker and two polo teams cantered in from the northeast corner of the field . <P> They stood motionless for a moment at the toss-in ; then the eight ponies twisted and straightened their necks and the last period started . Two minutes later , number one on the U. S. four , William Averell Harriman , carried the ball up from midfield and scored through a tangle at the goal . Five and a half minutes later the people in the stands stood cheering in the rain because the U. S. , after trailing at 2-5 , had won , by a score of 7-6 , the first game in the series intended to decide the " Championship of the Americas . " <P> Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( unlike Tommy Hitchcock , Winston Guest , Malcolm Stevenson ) William Averill Harriman became the hero of the exciting encounter . He had been placed upon the team late in the season , in the series of revisions which made the Argentines , who reached their peak the week before the matches , the favorites . If the U. S. four had failed to win , their forward would certainly have received the blame ; just as certainly their victory was due to his abruptly brilliant play in the last period . <P> Harriman , 41 , has only recently become a name in polo . The father of William Averell Harriman made millions of dollars in the railroad business and died before his eldest son went to Yale . With the $10,000,000 which he received with his majority , William Averell Harriman proceeded to have a good time in the shipping industry . This , he asserted to be " . . . the most important matter connected with the growth and well-being of the United States . . . . " Besides shipping , his financial attachments include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wright Aeronautical Corporation , the American Russian Chamber of Commerce . All of these he regards seriously though he speaks of them less frequently and less pompously than of his boating . In fact , William Averell Harriman is serious about almost everything he does . He is vigilant over a great boys ' club in Manhattan slums ; his farm in Arden , N. Y. , is run upon an efficient , not a sporting , plan and it produces each year one million quarts of milk . He plays polo gravely and accurately , without undue brilliance . His chief competitor for place on the U. S. four was Stephen ( " Laddie " ) Sanford , 30 , who also inherited a vast fortune ( carpets ) but who has consistently avoided office work . <P> As a polo player Harriman is the complete opposite of Lewis Lacey , the Argentine back , now one of the three active ten goal men in the world and perhaps as great a player as famed , retired Devereaux Milburn.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
