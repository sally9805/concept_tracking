txt // particular functions . The protozoan is likewise a complete organism which has been able to attain various degrees of complexity of organization and specialization of function without resort to the cellular scheme . Protozoa have in many cases great complexity of organization . Organs of all sorts are to be found within the limits of the protozoan body , but they are not composed of tissues or cells in the sense of the Cell Theory . On the other side of this controversy it must be said that a protozoan usually has but one nucleus ; that this nucleus contains chromatin ; that distinct chromosomes may often be distinguished ; that nuclei divide by a process very similar to mitotic cell division ; and that the whole protozoan body is divided much as a single cell is divided . Moreover , whole protozoans are differentiated into gametes , equivalent to egg cells or sperm cells in the Metazoa , and the sperm individuals fuse with the egg individuals in a fashion that is unmistakably equivalent to fertilization . Not only this , but prior to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those exhibited by eggs and sperm cells during maturation . This and much more evidence points strongly to the conclusion that protozoans are cells and that the whole individual protozoan is in a sense equivalent to a germ cell or any other cell of a metazoan organism . Dobell 's radical suggestion that Protozoa be regarded as noncellular organisms is , therefore , not likely to gain general acceptance . Yet he has done good service in pointing out that a too slavish adherence to the implications of the Cell Theory has caused the Protozoa to be wrongly interpreted . With Professor Ritter , we may conclude that in connection with the Protozoa " the concept cell must be held in strict subordination to the concept organism , in this as well as in other portions of the living world . " The protozoan is unquestionably a cell , but it is more than that : it is a complete organism . B. THE FALSE IDEA OF THE SIMPLICITY OF PROTOZOA Because a protozoan is a single cell , an impression has come to prevail that it is on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritter , " could be more misleading than the almost universal practice in elementary teaching of introducing beginners to the protozoa by showing , very superficially , an Amoeba and emphasizing its simplicity , and then keeping it in the foreground // of the learner 's thought as an exemplification of the doctrine that the Protozoa are extremely simple ' animals , that they are undifferentiated into organs and tissues ? that in fact they are hardly true animals at all . ' " No better method of correcting this misapprehension is available than to compare a highly differentiated protozoan with one of the simpler metazoans . For this purpose let us compare Diplodinium ecaudatum ( Fig. 31 ) ? a ciliate protozoan which inhabits the intestine of cattle ? with a fresh-water Hydra ( Fig. 32 ) . Both figures are longitudinal sections showing the amount of differentiation present . Which is the more complex , // and which the simpler organism ? One basis for comparison of the degree of differentiation present is to count the labeled regions in the two . There are 33 labeled structures , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only 16 different labeled structures in the metazoan , Hydra . Objections have been made to this mode of comparison on the ground that , were that if these were all labeled , Hydra would then appeare more complex of the two . In spite of these considera- tions Ritter seems to the writer to be more or less justified in his claim that Diplodinium , a microscopic protozoan organism , is more highly differentiated than the much larger metazoan , Hydra . It has a skeleton , a digestive tract with mouth and anus , locomotor organs , excretory organs , contractile organs performing a muscular function , sensory , and conductile organs . This organism gives one a good idea of what may be attained in complexity of organization without employing the scheme of multicellularity and of cellular specialization . The animal has a definite organization , with organs of higher rates of metabolism situated at the anterior end and those of lower rates of metabolism at the posterior end . We find regions of the cytoplasm clearly differentiated into organs or systems . Even a nervous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with muscular organs . We call these structures ORGANS ( more technically , ORGANELLES ) , and advisedly so , for we can not exclude them from such a title unless we arbitrarily hy ? // define organs so as to include only structures composed of cells . Only the small size of Diplodinium prevents the general recognition that it is a relatively highly differentiated organism . Too readily we assume its lowly status because it is a protozoan . There are simple Protozoa and there are complex Protozoa ? just as there are both simple and complex Metazoa ? and there is about as wide a divergence between simplest and most complex within the bounds of one subkingdom as within those of the other . In neither group are there forms that very closely approach real simplicity of organization approximating a homogeneous or structureless condition . A baseless assumption that some Protozoa are essentially undifferentiated masses of protoplasm has found its way into the more speculative phases of biological literature . A good illustration of the fallacy is found in Haeckel 's The Evolution of Man , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been evolved from the simplest organisms we know , the monera . These are the simplest living things we can conceive . Their whole body is nothing but a particle of plasm , a granule of albuminous matter . " As a matter of fact this monera is a pure fiction . There are no Protozoa that even approximate the condition of an undifferentiated , unorganized particle of plasm . We shall next make a detailed examination of Amoeba proteus as a type of the less complex Protozoa and of Paramecium caudatum as an example of the more complex Protozoa . From these two studies we may gain a general knowledge of the biology of the group . CHAPTER XI AMEBA ( SUBKINGDOM PROTOZOA ) No microscopic organism has come to be an object of so general popular interest as Amceba . Even writers of fiction speak glibly of the course of evolution " from Amoeba to man . " One popular writer refers to Amceba as " the Adam and Eve of animate life . " The impression prevails that Amoeba is the lowest possible expression of life , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Not only is Amoeba supposed to occupy the lowest rung of the phylogenetic ladder , but the assertion is not infrequently made that it is the actual ancestor of higher forms of life . The absurdity of claiming a relationship of ancestry and posterity between two contemporaneous groups need scarcely be pointed out , but this is the same fallacy as that involved in statements that man is the descendant of the present anthropoid apes or monkeys . Amoeba is supposed to be a lowly form of life that has lived and multiplied throughout the millions of years since life began without having very materially advanced . The pedigree of Amoeba is doubtless as long as that of man and involves hundreds of times as many generations , yet Amceba remains in a relatively primitive and uncomplicated state . It may possibly have had a period of greater complexity of organization and then regressed secondarily to a simpler condition . About the real ancestral history of Amoeba we know nothing . A. GENERAL CHARACTERS OF AMEBA PROTEUS There are many kinds ( species ) of Amoeba , some simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species which we are going to study in detail is a sort of representative Amoeba . This little organism , sometimes called the " proteus animalcule , " when in the full-grown state is about .25 mm . ( T , - , of an inch ) in diameter , a relatively large one-celled organism . It lives in fresh-114 // water ponds and in damp places . Leidy , who published a classic study of Amoeba and its relatives , found his best specimens in some abandoned tanning pits . Amoeba proteus was doubtless named after Proteus , a mythological sea god of the ancients , who was constantly changing his shape . Its ever shifting form is a characteristic of Amoeba : its irregular outlines are always changing . It is often described as a shapeless mass of protoplasm , colorless except for the presence of darker food particles inclosed within its substance . Careful examination and study of its behavior indicate , however , that it is a true organism and that it is less simple than some would have us believe . Hyman has shown experimentally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always , in an active individual , one end that keeps ahead in locomotion and an opposite end that drags behind . Lobelike PSEUDOPODIA are thrust out in the direction of locomotion and the latest pseudopod represents for the time being the controlling region , or the apical end , of Amoeba . A newer pseudopod then usurps control and the older ones retire to subordinate rank and withdraw . Amoeba then has an organization , but one that is not fixed for long periods , a shifting organization which is to be contrasted sharply with that of Paramecium . B. GENERAL ANATOMY OF AMoeBA PROTEUS It is customary to distinguish in the body of Amoeba two main structural regions : an outer clear , translucent layer of apparently homogeneous protoplasm , the ECTOPLASM , and an inner , central mass of heterogeneous consistency , the ENDOPLASM ( Fig. 33 , C ) . Somewhere in the endoplasm lies a NUCLEUS , and , moving about more or less , a CONTRACTILE VACUOLE which disappears and reappears at intervals . Numerous vacuoles containing particles of food in various stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these FOOD VACUOLES , containing debris consisting of sand grains or indigestible food materials , approaches the exterior , breaks through the ectoplasm , and discharges its contents ( Fig. 33 , A ) . Each of these regions and organs demands more detailed examination . The ECTOPLASM ( ec ) is not a true cell membrane , but possesses at least the functional equivalent of a membrane on its outer surface ; in fact , a distinct pellicle has been demonstrated by microdissection methods in Amoeba verrucosa . The whole ectoplasm has a semi- // solid or gelatinous consistency and is able to change shape only quite slowly . The ENDOPLASM ( en ) is much more fluid in its consistency . One can readily see vesicles shifting about as though suspended in a fluid medium . The two body regions are not sharply marked off from each other but seem to blend one into the other . The NUCLEUS ( n ) is so nearly colorless and so likely to be surrounded by other , more visible granules and vacuoles that it is difficult to distinguish in living specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen to have the form of a somewhat flattened sphere whose position with reference to the other structures of the body is quite variable . It has a definite nuclear membrane and contains a large number of small deeply staining , spherical particles that have all the properties of CHROMATIN . The nucleus has been shown experimentally to be the metabolic center of the body . If a large Amoeba be cut into two pieces , one with the nucleus and the other without , the nucleated piece lives on normally , grows , and multiplies ; while the enucleated piece ceases to feed or to grow and soon wastes away and dies . The nucleus plays also a very important role in reproduction , as will be brought out in a subsequent paragraph . The CONTRACTILE VACUOLE ( c.v. ) can be seen under the microscope as a clear round space , slightly pinkish in tint and larger than other vesicular bodies in the endoplasm , which arises as a small spot and then grows larger and larger until , like a bubble from a bubble pipe , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optical properties , is a vesicle filled with watery fluid which is collected from the surrounding protoplasm and then discharged through a perforation in the ectoplasm . Careful studies of the phases of growth and discharge of this structure have shown that the vacuole first lies near the nucleus , but as it grows it leaves the latter and moves toward the surface , coming to rest against the ectoplasm near the posterior end of the body . It presses against the ectoplasm , flattening it out until only a thin film separates it from the exterior . This film finally breaks suddenly and the liquid wastes of the vacuole are discharged . The function of the contractile vacuole is not fully determined , but the consensus of opinion is that it serves as a means of regulating the proportion of water in the body of the organism . Feeding processes seem to require the taking in of a good deal more water than can be used , and excess water // must be eliminated . Recent work on Paramecium seems to indicate that the contractile vacuole excretes little , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an open question whether in Amoeba the contractile vacuole plays any other than a water regulating role . C. PHYSIOLOGY OF AMEBA 1 . The Nutritive Processes Amoeba illustrates the processes of feeding , digestion , assimilation , energy production , and excretion , reduced to very simple terms . Thus we may study the whole metabolic cycle carried on within the confines of a small one-celled body . Amoeba , like any other animal , depends for its nutriment upon smaller animals and plants . Though so small and so lowly , it is a miniature pond ogre , going about seeking whom it may devour . Its prey consists chiefly of smaller Protozoa and small aquatic plants , such as desmids and diatoms . Even small Metazoa , such as rotifers , are caught , subdued , and swallowed whole by a large Amoeba . An Ameba has the ability to discriminate between inorganic particles , such as sand , and objects suitable for food , and seems to show a preference for certain large species of diatoms , one of which is quite a meal for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food into the body is called INGESTION and the mouth is the usual organ of ingestion . Amceba , curiously enough , has no mouth . Any point on the sur- // face that comes into contact with food may become , for the time being , a mouth . The method of ingestion is that of engulfing ( Fig. 33 , B and Fig. 34 ) . An Amoeba in its forward progress comes in contact with a food mass . The part immediately in contact with the food stops flowing forward and the parts of the body above , below , and on the sides , flow forward , forming a pocket about the food . The edges of the pocket bend in , meet , and fuse so as completely to surround the ingested object . More or less water is taken in at the same time and thus is formed a FOOD VACUOLE ( Fig. 33 , B and Fig. 34 , 4 ) . One favorite kind of Amoeba food is a filamentous green alga ( Oscillaria ) , a primitive and very abundant water plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 35 ) . Starting in either at one end or the middle , the ingested part is progressively coiled up inside until the protoplasm has flowed around the whole piece . Sometimes the prospective meal of an Amoeba proves somewhat refractory , moving away when the process of engulfment begins , or struggling to release itself ; but the devourer is not easily discouraged , following up and repeating its attempts until ultimately successful , or until the prey moves entirely out of range . Discrimination between inedible and edible substances implies sensibilities of a highly specific sort . Though there are no organs of smell or of taste , the surface protoplasm has the capacity to receive and to react to // chemical and physical stimuli . In order properly to stimulate the engulfing reflex , a substance must have a certain amount of solidity and also certain chemical properties . Neither digestible substances in solution nor nonnutritious solid particles are effective in stimulating the events of ingestion. b . How Amceba Digests Its Food. ? A food vacuole is in reality one of the stomachs of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a stomach ; it is a whole digestive tract in miniature . The surrounding protoplasm secretes digestive juices and pours them into the vacuole . Food is rendered liquid and diffuses out of the vacuole into the surrounding protoplasm and the indigestible debris is carried to the surface and egested or cast out by being simply left behind when the Amoeba moves on ( Fig. 33 , A ) ; at least that is how it appears . A sort of baglike mass of heavy materials seems to gravitate toward the posterior end of a forward moving Amoeba and when it becomes too heavy it seems to be merely dropped out through the ectoplasm , and the lightened organism moves on . The processes of ASSIMILATION and DISSIMILATION are the same in Amoeba as elsewhere : the dissolved food materials , such as sugars and peptones , are built up into living protoplasm and the living protoplasm is constantly breaking down by oxidative processes , releasing heat and energy for locomotion and other physiological activities . There is some evidence that the by-products of dissimilation are the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CO2 . c . How Amoeba Breathes. ? There is no question but that Amoeba respires : it takes oxygen from the surrounding water and combines it with protoplasmic matter . Carbon dioxide and other wastes are given off by the contractile vacuoles . If an Amoeba is placed in water from which oxygen has been removed , its activities gradually cease . No more food is ingested and it goes into a dormant condition from which it may be aroused by adding oxygen to the water . Amoebae live commonly in rather foul water in which the amount of oxygen in solution is relatively low , and where , owing to the prevalence of decaying vegetation , the concentration of CO2 is relatively high . Removal of oxygen from the water is therefore not immediately felt and it may take a number of hours to make an Amoeba show marked signs of asphyxiation . // 2 . The Locomotor Processes Amoeba actually walks on its false feet ( pseudopodia ) , although this fact was not discovered until after years of study by various competent investigators . The discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When these little animals were first discovered , the observers noted , just as you can note when looking at any Amoeba under a microscope , that the ectoplasm bulges out at some point and the endoplasm flows out into the process . Thus the whole organism seems to flow forward in the direction of the advancing pseudopod . Sometimes two pseudopods start out in different directions and the Amceba seems to have a hard time to decide between two directions of advance . There is an apparent contest between the two pseudopods until one gives up and flows back , while the other flows more rapidly forward . It has long been a great problem to explain on mechanical grounds the formation of pseudopodia and the way in which they draw after them the rest of the body . The whole point of this problem lies in the fact that here we have a very simple case of spontaneous movement in protoplasm or of mechanical work done by protoplasm . If we could solve the mechanism of pseudopodial movement , we should have the key to other , more complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular contraction . Three main theories have been advanced to account in physicochemical terms for pseudopodial locomotion . A brief outline of each is presented herewith . a . The Adhesion Theory. ? According to this view , Amoeba moves for the same reason that a drop of water or any other inorganic fluid placed on a piece of glass sometimes spreads irregularly instead of maintaining a circular outline . The explanation given is that the glass has an uneven surface , is not perfectly clean , but is slightly greasy in spots . Where the glass is clean , adhesion takes place more perfectly and the drop spreads out more rapidly , while it adheres less well to grease or other substances . Applying the adhesion theory to Amoeba , it was supposed that the surface on which it moves is irregular as to its adhesive properties and that the pseudopods flow in the paths of greater adhesion . The weakness of this theory is that pseudopods are very frequently thrust out free , not in contact with any surface . Hence contact of any // sort is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Surface Tension Theory. ? Surface tension is a physical property of fluids which involves a tensile pull of the surface film . It is believed to account for the spherical form of such objects as soap bubbles or drops of oil suspended in water ; for the surface of these bodies has contracted to the greatest possible extent , in as much as a sphere has the least surface in proportion to its mass . According to Butschli and Rhumbler , who proposed this theory , Amoeba is a fluid body which would be spherical in a homogeneous medium , but in a heterogeneous medium like pond water it encounters conditions on one side that lessen the surface tension . At this weakened point the surface bulges out into a pseudopod . Constantly changing conditions cause the local weakening of surface tension to shift from one place to another and , consequently , the withdrawal of one pseudopod and the thrusting out of another . Experiments with rancid oil drops in aqueous solutions seemed to substantiate this theory ; for they could be made to change shape and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were applied locally to portions of the surface . It was noted that in a region of lowered surface tension currents were set up which flowed backward along the surface and forward in the center . Dellinger has demonstrated that currents in a pseudopod of Amoeba do not flow in that way but in exactly the opposite directions ; yet this theory held sway for some time in spite of its weaknesses . c . Contraction Theories. ? An early notion obtained that the thrusting out of pseudopods was due to protoplasmic contractility of some sort ; but the ideas of the exact nature and location of the contraction impulse were somewhat naive . Amoeba was looked upon as a fluid-filled , elastic sac which could undergo contraction of parts of the surface , causing the weakest part of the wall to bulge out . According to this view , currents in the protoplasm should be observed first in the region of contraction and subsequently in the out-pushed region . But it was soon seen that currents begin at the point of pseudopod formation and not at the point supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories . Two American investigators have reinstated the contraction theory by putting the matter in an entirely new light . Jennings // had the ingenious notion of marking in some way the surface of an Amoeba in order to watch the fate of any point under observation . This he did by dropping on an Ameeba 's back a particle of lamp black . This adheres firmly and furnishes a fine landmark by means of which the relative rates of flow of ectoplasm and endoplasm can be followed and shifts in position of the ectoplasm may be mapped out . Jennings ' diagram of a progressing Amceba is X FIG. 36 . Diagram of the movements of a particle attached to the outer surface of Amoeba verrucosa , in side view . ( From Jennings. ) shown in Figure 36 . An analysis of the locomotion of an Amceba is thus given by Jennings : " In an advancing Amceba substance flows forward on the upper surface , rolls over at the anterior edge , coming in contact with the substratum , then remains quiet until the body of the Amoeba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posterior end and forward again on the upper surface , continuing in rotation as long as the Amoeba continues to progress . The motion of the upper surface is congruent with that of the endoplasm , the two forming a single stream . The movement can be imitated roughly by making a cylinder of cloth , laying it flat on a plane surface , and pulling forward the anterior edge in a series of waves . The entire cylinder then rolls forward just as Amceba does . " Two points in connection with Jennings ' work should be mentioned : first , that he does not state definitely the location of the contractile substances which pull the Amceba forward ; second , he used a species of Amoeba ( A. verrucosa ) which is almost devoid of pseudopodia and actually does seem to roll along as simply as he describes . The rolling theory , however , does not apply at all well to Amoeba proteus . We owe to Dellinger the best explanation of how Amceba walks . This author had frequently observed that small organisms swam under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This gave him a clue to the real situation . If one were to try to discover the mode of locomotion of a horse by looking down upon it from the top of a skyscraper , he might get an entirely wrong ' 1 2 3 4 5 imhommlem j. // impression : so with Amoeba . We have always looked down upon Amoeba from a great height above . Dellinger conceived the idea of looking at the animal from the side exactly as one would look at a horse from the sidewalk . He made a promenade for the Amoeba in the following way : one edge of a glass slide was ground smooth and flat . Two long cover slips were cemented with edges protruding somewhat beyond the flat edge of the slide , as shown in Figure 37 . The microscope was then bent over into a hori- zontal position , thus bringing the troughlike slot of the slide uppermost and putting the flat surface parallel with the earth 's surface . Amoebae were then placed in the trough along with water , and observations and microphotographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that advancing Amoebae " extend the anterior end free in the water and attach it at or near the tip and then contract . At the same time the posterior end is contracting and the substance thus pushed and pulled forward goes to form the new anterior end . This continues as long as the Amoeba advances ( Fig. 33 , D , E , F ) . Often the anterior end is pushed along the substratum but no attachments form except at definite points . . . . In other cases the anterior end is lifted free and then curves down to the substratum and attaches , forming a long loop . The posterior end is then released , and the substance flows over to the anterior end . At the same time another anterior end is extended . " Dellinger showed that Amoeba can walk on the ceiling as well as the floor . The important point to note is that the animal actually walks , putting one foot out and then another . When a forward step is made , a foot ( pseudopod ) is stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // This is the locomotor act : for contraction involves mechanical work . We do not know for certain exactly what makes a pseudopod extend and then contract , but the prevailing theory is that protoplasm , especially the ectoplasm , is a colloid substance that expands when it takes up water and tends to flow outward . Attachment is believed to stimulate the reverse phase of the protoplasm , causing it to undergo loss of water together with local contraction and shortening . There is a rhythmic alternation of exchanges of water between the ectoplasm and endoplasm , and this give alternate contractions and expansions . If this be the correct explanation of pseudopodial movement , it is not unlikely that all rhythmic protoplasmic movements , such as those in cilia or those in muscle fibers , are due to the same reversible changes in colloids. d . Mast 's Theory. ? The latest interpretation of the mechanics of locomotion in Amoeba has been worked out by S. O. Mast and his pupils . Working with relatively simple Amoebae , they have been able to determine that the forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more viscous ectoplasm , especially in regions back of the pseudopodia . There is a forward current in the more fluid endoplasm which causes an outflow at points where the ectoplasm is thinnest and less solid . As the plasmasol flows out through the aperture it becomes transformed into plasmagel around the base of the pseudopod , building it out " much as a chimney might be extended by carrying bricks and mortar up through it and depositing them on the wall surrounding the opening . " To carry out this figure , it must be supposed that the wall at the bottom of the " chimney " is constantly undergoing disintegration into bricks and mortar , thus providing more material for transportation to the top . Thus plasmasol changes to plasmagel at one end and the reverse change takes place at the other . The flow is initiated by contraction of the ectoplasm and a sort of bursting forth of the endoplasm to form pseudopods . This latest view then appears to be a refinement of the earlier contraction theories . 3 . The Behavior of Amceba All activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are included within the definition of the word " behavior . " Many studies have been made of the ways in which // Amoeba responds to different kinds of external stimuli . Jennings has grouped the reactions of Amoeba into positive responses , negative responses , and food taking responses . We have already dealt with the food taking reaction , and shall omit further consideration of this process . When a stimulus strikes an Amoeba , it behaves either as though it likes it or dislikes it . If it likes it , it moves toward it or at least it goes on undisturbed . If it dislikes it , it moves away . The words " like " and " dislike " are open to objection . Instead , let us say that an Amoeba that reacts favorably toward light , for example , is positively phototactic or exhibits positive phototaxis ; that , if it reacts unfavorably to light , it is negatively phototactic . The movements toward or away from the stimulus are called TROPISMS . Thus we speak of positive and negative phototropism . In Amoeba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light ) , 2 . Thermotropism ( reaction to heat ) , 3 . Thigmotropism ( reaction to contact ) , 4 . Chemotropism ( reaction to chemicals ) , 5 . Galvanotropism ( reaction to the galvanic current ) , 6 . Geotropism ( reaction to gravity ) , 7 . Rheotropism ( reaction to currents ) . Amoeba reacts to all of these stimuli in either a positive or a negative way . Sometimes a positive response will be given to a stimulus of a certain intensity , and a negative response to one of a greater or less intensity . Studies of the behavior of Amoeba under a great variety of stimuli have shown that it behaves in much the same ways as do higher organisms . This has interested the students of psychology . They feel that a complete understanding of Ameeba 's activities might reveal the beginnings of mind , of intelligence . Without going into detail in this place , it may be said that Amceba seems to show evidences of possessing mental faculties which are , in the words of Jennings , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of higher organisms " and , " if Amoeba were a large animal , so as to come within the everyday experience of human beings , its behavior would at once call forth the attribution to it of states of pleasure and pain , of hunger , desire , and the like , on precisely the same basis as we attribute these things to a dog . " It is no more difficult to believe that // Amoeba has a kind of mind than that a germ cell has a mind . Yet , according to Conklin , an egg cell or a spermatozoon has sensitivity and responds to stimuli by appropriate tropisms or reflexes , thus exhibiting the beginnings of mental activity . A germ cell and an Amceba probably possess minds of about the same sort . D. REPRODUCTION IN AMEBA The life cycle of Amoeba proteus is unexpectedly complex for so lowly an organism . According to Calkins who has studied the life cycle in great detail , Amoeba has an infancy , a youth , a period of maturity , and an old age . Starting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one pseudopod , it goes through a period of growth and increasing complexity until it reaches the full grown stage . When it reaches the maximum size , it divides by binary fission ( Fig. 38 ) into two daughter Amoeba . Each of these grows to twice its initial size and binary fission again // occurs . How many times this phase of multiplication may be repeated depends upon the particular strain of Amoeba used and the favorableness of the environmental conditions . During binary fission the nucleus sometimes appears to divide by ami tosis , but more often clear evidences of a sort of simplified mitosis are observed ( Fig . After the period of binary fission comes to an end a period of encystment and sporulation intervenes . This appears to be a very complicated process and the observers of the process fail to agree upon its - details . Obviously , however , the period is divide . Both nu- one of senescence . The final stage is the formation of pseudopodiospores ? essentially mitotic figures . after infant Amoebm . Thus we are back where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for organisms and is dealt with here to emphasize that Amceba in one stage may be fairly simple , but when we come to study all of its varied phases , it loses for us its simplicity and makes an impression of confusing complexity . CHAPTER XII PARAMECIUM ( SUBKINGDOM PROTOZOA ) Paramecium caudatum and P. aurelia are zoological classics . While the first species is somewhat commoner , the latter is more frequently figured in the illustrations . Paramecium is called the " slipper animalcule " because of a fancied resemblance to a crude slipper . In outline one can see that the anterior end is blunt and narrow like the heel and that the posterior end is broader and pointed like the toe . Perhaps the oral groove may be thought of as like the opening to the inside of the slipper . Paramecium is one of the most abundant of Protozoa and is perhaps the most readily obtained for laboratory work . It is therefore a favorite denizen of the zoological laboratories . Quite commonly one finds Amoeba and Paramecium living together in the same environment . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler types of Protozoa , Paramecium may be contrasted with it as one of the more complex members of that group . A. GENERAL MORPHOLOGY 1 . Paramecium and Amoeba Contrasted Amceba was seen to be a shifty individual , never looking the same any two successive minutes , with a changing axis and with a nucleus and contractile vacuoles floating about in the endoplasm . Paramecium ( Fig. 40 ) , on the other hand , has a fixed axis , with permanent anterior and posterior ends and a permanent semispiral groove ? the ORAL GRoovE ? running from the anterior end down to the permanent MOUTH . The mouth opens into a funnellike depression called the CYTOPHARYNX , or GULLET . Instead of temporary locomotor organs like the pseudopodia of Amoeba , Paramecium has the entire surface covered with numerous whiplike motor organs called CILIA . The ectoplasm is not naked as in Amoeba , but is covered with a thin , tough CUTICLE , or 129 // PELLICLE . Under this there is a definitely differentiated layer called the CORTEX , which contains closely packed TRICxoCYSTS that give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The endoplasm is fluid , as in Amceba , but both the MACRONUCLEUS and MICRONUCLEUS , as well as the two CONTRACTILE VACUOLES appear to be anchored definitely at fixed points . There is also a fixed ANUS situated just back of the oral groove . The general impression one gets from a comparison between Amoeba and Paramecium is that the latter has a much more highly specialized organization : its organs are much more definite and // fixed . If one were asked to say which is the higher organism , one would undoubtedly answer that Paramecium is higher . When pinned down as to what is meant by higher or lower , one would have to reply that it is all a matter of degree of specialization . Paramecium is probably no more capable of meeting the world struggle than is Amoeba . Both must be eminently successful and well adapted animals , else they could hardly have survived all these ages of competitive life . One is as fit as the other . Perhaps we are all wrong in ranking one organism as high and another low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best be thinking about as he surveys various animal groups . 2 . Finer Details of Structure The permanency of form of Paramecium is due to the fact that the ectoplasm is a well defined , fairly stiff body wall . The external layer , or PELLICLE , is a separate layer which can be blistered free from the cortex by adding a little weak alcohol to a drop of water containing Paramecia . The pellicle , viewed from the surface , appears to be sculptured into rows of hexagonal areas , each of which has a cilium attached to its center ( Fig. 41 , A ) . Between the hexagonal areas occur little pores that seem to be holes through which TRICHOCYSTS are extruded . Trichocysts are characteristic structures of the cortex ( the layer of ectoplasm beneath the pellicle ) . These bodies are arranged perpendicularly to the surface ( Fig. 41 , B ) . Just what trichocysts are , how they arise , and how they function , are matters incompletely understood . They seem to be semifluid in consistency ; they arise in the endoplasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter ; they migrate to the exterior and locate themselves in a very accurately spaced fashion . When the animal is strongly irritated , the trichocysts are discharged as long sticky threads through pores in the pellicle . The trichocysts serve primarily as organs of defense in that they adhere to and entangle organisms , such as Didinium , that attack Paramecium ( Fig. 41 ) . The ENDOPLASM has a bubbly or alveolar appearance . There are in it many food vacuoles and various large granular bodies which are probably reserve food materials . The whole endoplasm seems to circulate about in one distinct current which carries with it the food vacuoles and all other movable structures . Such a food path may be likened to an alimentary tract. // The two CONTRACTILE VACUOLES can hardly be assigned definitely to either ectoplasm or endoplasm . They seem to be mainly in the latter but are definitely fastened to the former . Their posi- tion is on the ABORAL surface ( that away from the mouth ) . Each vacuole is provided with from six to ten long radiating canals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts of the body . Each canal receives water from the endoplasm that lies in // contact with it . When the canals are all full and distended at their inner ends , they simultaneously discharge their contents into the vacuole , which then contracts and forces the liquid out through a pore in the pellicle . Then the canals fill again . The two contractile vacuoles work alternately , one being in the full condition while the other is empty . The rhythm of dis- ' charge of the vacuoles in a quietly feeding individual is rather exact , for one can note that a definite time interval elapses between discharges . The functions of the contractile described for Amoeba . It has recently been shown by Weatherly that the function of the vacuole ( in Paramecium ) is not the elimination of nitrogenous waste products of metabolism , but is probably the regulation of hydrostatic pressure within the cell . The method of feeding necessitates taking a great deal of excess water , and if this could not be eliminated fast enough the animal would swell up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARAMECIUM 1 . How Paramecium Swims The Equipment of Cilia. ? The swimming unit is the CILIUM ( plural , CILIA ) , a whiplike process projecting from the center of each hexagonal area of the pellicle . The cilia at the posterior end in Paramecium caudatum are longer than elsewhere and this little caudal tuft has given it the specific name , caudatum ( meaning tailed ) . A cilium is believed to be equivalent to a long , permanent pseudopod . The mechanics of ciliary motion is still an unsolved problem , but in the light of what we have discovered about the // basis of pseudopodial movement , it seems highly probable that the movement is due to rhythmic contraction and expansion of colloidal elements in the cilium . Flagella , which are much like cilia in structure and in function , have been shown to have distinct contractile fibrils running throughout their length , and it is probable that cilia are similarly constructed . This theory would imply that , when the animal is moving forward , fibrils on the posterior side of each cilium contract more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal moves backward , however , as it frequently does when avoiding unfavorable regions of the environment , the anterior contractile substances contract more vigorously than the posterior . The cilia of the oral groove and of the mouth are stronger and more vigorous than elsewhere , and serve to cause a vortex of water to be pulled into the mouth . This serves as a feeding mechanism . The cilia of the dorsal part of the oral funnel , or mouth , are fused together side by side into a flat sheet called the UNDULATING MEMBRANE , which serves the function of guiding food particles into the mouth . The Spiral Path of Paramecium. ? When Paramecium swims through the water , it does not follow a straight course but , when unobstructed , describes a distinct spiral , such as one would describe in going up a steep spiral staircase on all fours . The explanation of this spiral course is somewhat complicated . In the first place the beat of the cilia is not straight backward but diagonally over to the left . This would , of itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spinning on its long axis like a shell shot from the rifled bore of a cannon . In the second place , the beat of the cilia in the oral groove is much stronger than elsewhere and is continually pulling a vortex of water toward the oral surface . This has the same effect as pulling the oral groove side of the Paramecium off its course . As the animal is continually revolving , the oral groove is pointed successively to all radii of the axis , and that produces the spiral course . This may need a little figuring out on the part of the student . If a Paramecium could be attached by its tail to a swivel and its ciliary action kept up as in normal locomotion , it would describe a cone . Imagine this cone projected forward and you would have a spiral . The adaptive features of the spiral path , as discussed by Jennings , are that the spiral path , as contrasted with a straight course , affords a much more extensive range for food hunting operations . As Paramecium goes forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side , and now to the other , and always it draws in a cone of water from ahead of it . If the cone of water contains food , the direction is altered so that the animal runs into the food region . If , however , the animal went straight ahead like a bullet , it could not cover anything like so much territory and its chances of finding food would be correspondingly less . It will soon be shown how the spiral path aids in keeping out of danger . 2 . How Paramecium Feeds We have already shown how Paramecium hunts for food . When it enters a region of abundant food , such as a mass of bacteria , it seems to quiet down and come to rest . The stimulus of the food seems to act as a depressant upon the body cilia and they move very slowly ; but the cilia of the oral groove show increased activity . A vortex of food-laden water is swept down the oral groove and is focused by means of the undulatory membrane into the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked protoplasm inside of the mouth that a pocket is made in the endoplasm ( see Fig. 39 ) . The pocket grows larger and larger like a bubble on a bubble pipe , and bacteria continue to collect within it until the bubble breaks off and floats away with its load of food . It is then a FOOD VACUOLE . Vacuole after vacuole is formed in this way , and they move off as though caught in a current and follow one another in a procession . As the food vacuoles drift along a well defined path , which is functionally equivalent to a digestive tract , the process of digestion takes place ; the digested food is passed out into the surrounding protoplasm , assimilated , and used up in energy and growth . It has already been shown how the contractile vacuoles serve to remove the excess water from the food vacuoles . All that now remains is for the indigestible material to be discarded . This takes place when the old food vacuoles drift to the posterior end and give off their debris through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used as experimental material by many investigators interested in the analysis of the behavior of lower organisms . It has been discovered , as was the case for Amoeba , that Paramecium exhibits in more or less definite fashion all of the types of tropism . There is practically no controversy as to the // fact that the animals are guided by stimuli of all sorts so that they collect in regions of favorable stimuli and depart from regions of unfavorable stimuli . The real controversy centers about the exact method by means of which Paramecium directs its course to or from the sources of stimulation . Two contrasting interpretations of the directed behavior of Paramecium , and similarly of many other animals , have been offered : the one implying that the organism is a pure automaton driven helplessly by the external forces , and the other that the organism has a good deal to do with directing its own course and choosing its own location . The former is the Tropism Theory of animal behavior and the second the Trial and Error Theory . Tropism versus Trial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interested in the analysis of the behavior of the lower organisms than they are today . Most of the pioneer work in the field of animal behavior was done by the zoologists ; but now this field has been lifted almost bodily out of the zoological laboratories and transferred to those of comparative psychology . Some zoologists with ecological propensities are still interested in animal behavior as a phase of the response of organism to environment . While interest in animal behavior was still strong and fresh among zoologists , two distinct schools of animal behaviorists developed . One school , strongly inclined to take an extreme mechanistic attitude toward animal responses , looked upon Paramecium , for example , as a helpless , blind automaton driven about by external stimuli after the fashion of John Hayes Hammond 's automatic torpedo . This torpedo is provided with selenium cells on the two sides , which are so sensitive to light that a searchlight thrown on the moving torpedo from straight behind stimulates both sides equally ; but if it turns to one side , the selenium cell of the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will straighten the course . Paramecium is thought to be thus guided by stimuli in such a way that when the directed lines of energy strike it on one side , they will either stimulate or quiet that side , thus rendering the beat of cilia on the two sides unequal in strength . This will cause the animal to turn until the two sides are equally stimulated , when it will swim directly toward or directly away from the stimulus . This is , in outline at least , a statement of the tropism theory of animal behavior as applied to Paramecium by the late Jacques Loeb. // Professor H. S. Jennings was the first to take issue with this theory . In his studies of Paramecium under all sorts of environmental conditions he was never able to see any evidence that Paramecium behaved in this simple , direct fashion . Anyone who observes the animals swimming about gets quite a different impression of their activities . They seem to start , stop , back up , start off in another direction , and never to maintain a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the most favorable part of its environment is quite different from that implied in the Tropism Theory . When a Paramecium is swimming forward in a spiral path , testing the water ahead and to one side of it by means of the test cone of water drawn into the oral groove , it comes to a region where the content of the water is unfavorable . If markedly unfavorable , the animal gives a prompt negative response , the so-called " AVOIDING REACTION " ( Fig. 43 ) . The direction of ciliary beat is suddenly reversed , sending the animal backward for a short distance until it is out of range of the adverse stimulus . Then the forward beat of cilia is resumed . While overcoming the momentum of the backward motion , the body simply whirls on its tail like a top slightly off balance , the anterior end describing a circle . As it spins around , the oral groove samples the water in all directions , and , when the sample is satisfactory , forward progress is resumed along one of the axes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning around and trying a number of directions before selecting a favorable one is called the TRIAL AND ERROR method of orientation . // The avoiding reaction and the trial and error process may be repeated a great many times and doubtless will be kept up as long as there are unfavorable stimuli in the environment . When Paramecium by this more or less experimental method finally gets into the most favorable neighborhood , it either comes to rest for feeding purposes or , if still stimulated , keeps moving about . Whenever it swims toward a less favorable region , the avoiding reaction drives it back , and it is thus practically trapped in the favorable region , unable to get out of it . That is Jennings ' explanation of why we find great aggregations of Paramecia on one side or other of a dish placed in some position where light enters from one direction . By continually avoiding the less favorably lighted regions they finally come to comparative rest at the region of optimum ( most favorable ) light intensity . Thus they are not forced directly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Tropism Theory claims , but reach their destination in a much less direct fashion , by trying and trying , rejecting and rejecting , until finally , more or less by chance , the best region is found . When once the most favorable region is found , the animal will give the avoiding reaction to all regions less favorable . This whole explanation of Professor Jennings seems to imply that Paramecium is not a pure automaton driven by forces outside of itself , but that it is very much in control of its own activities . Some critics have claimed that this view borders on a vitalistic interpretation , but this criticism is quite unjustified . Though small in size , Paramecium is not a very simple organism and it behaves very much like many metazoan organisms . It is only when we ignore the organic complexity of the Protozoa that we make the mistake of oversimplifying their activities . The activities of Paramecium compare very favorably with those of Metazoa as high in the scale as worms and mollusks . Moreover , even human beings learn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing a thing and select the most effective one ; we have our avoiding reactions , our protective reflexes of various sorts ; and many of our mental activities are as automatic as those of Paramecium . C. REPRODUCTION AND THE LIFE CYCLE OF PARAMECIUM The life cycle of Paramecium is a complex one , involving many intricate changes in both nucleus and cytosome . It consists of a // series of divisions of whole individuals by transverse binary fission , interrupted at long intervals by a temporary union or conjugation of two individuals ? the latter a sexual act . There is thus a sort of alternation between asexual and sexual reproduction . Binary Fission. ? When a Paramecium is about to begin fission the micronucleus ? there are two of these in P. aurelia ? the small inconspicuous body that normany lies imbedded in the side of the much larger macronucleus , leaves its position and under-goes a peculiar sort of mitotic division ( Fig. 44 ) . In the ana phases the mitotic figure is long and slender with two knoblike ends where the daughter chromatin lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much likethat seen in typical mitotic division . Subsequently the middle parts of the spindle fade away , leaving the two rounded ends widely separated , one near the anterior and one near the posterior end of the individual . m , ! The macronucleus follows suit , elongates , and becomes dumbbell shaped ; the two halves pull apart and nuclear division is complete . The gullet buds off a small posterior branch which migrates backward to form the gullet of the posterior ( laughter individual . cuole ; undulating membrane remains in the old gullet and a new // one arises in the new gullet . A new contractile vacuole arises in each of the two prospective individuals . While these changes have been in progress a constriction has arisen around the body at about equal distances from the two ends . This cuts deeper and deeper into the body until the last threadlike junction between the two bodies is broken and two completely separate daughter individuals are produced . This all takes place in about two hours , more or less , depending on the temperature and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about once every twenty-four hours , and it may continue without variation for weeks or even months . The daughter Paramecia are not exactly like the parent at first , and they also differ from each other , for they have been derived from two quite different portions of the body . Moreover , each is only half as large as the parent . A period of DEDIFFERENTIATION ensues , during which the inherited structural differences between the two are gradually done away with , and each individual then redifferentiates the structural characteristics of its species and grows up to full size . Heredity. ? It is easy to understand why a daughter Paramecium inherits its characters from its parent . It is merely a continuation of the parent , for the production of offspring eliminates the parent . The PHYSICAL BASIS OF HEREDITY iS well illustrated here . An offspring resembles the parent because it arises through the isolation from the parent body of a representative living part of the latter , a part endowed with a capacity to redevelop the specific differentiations possessed by the parent . Conjugation. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule is that after a certain number of fissions , varying in different strains , conjugation ensues . An experienced investigator , watching his pedigreed cultures from day to day , soon learns to detect the signs of approaching conjugation . The individuals look unhealthy , appear somewhat opaque , and move about as though excited . When two Paramecia are ready to conjugate , they come into contact by their oral surfaces and adhere in this position because of the sticky character of the surface protoplasm . At about the middle of the surface of contact a protoplasmic bridge is formed , uniting the internal protoplasm of the two individuals . This union , together with the ensuing events , is interpreted as a sexual act . // Our attention must now be focused upon the changes in the micronucleus , which up till now has been quiescent , imbedded in the side of the macronucleus . The micronucleus ( two of these in P. aurelia ) frees itself and then undergoes a mitotic division about like that described for binary fission . Almost immediately the two daughter nuclei divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disintegrate , while the fourth divides again // into a smaller and a larger nucleus . In each animal the smaller nucleus migrates across the protoplasmic bridge , enters the other individual , and fuses with the larger nucleus of that individual . Both individuals have thus exchanged nuclear material and now possess a new nucleus composed of chromatin materials from two individuals . This whole series of changes has been compared to the processes of maturation and fertilization of germ cells in the Metazoa , and doubtless there is a deep-seated analogy between the two processes . The two preliminary divisions remind one of the two MATURATION DIVISIONS in Metazoa , which result in the formation of four cells out of one , and especially call to mind the maturation divisions of the egg in which are produced one functional egg and three abortive eggs , or polar bodies . There is no division in Metazoa corresponding to that which gives rise to the stationary and the migrating nucleus ; but the large stationary nucleus is like an egg nucleus , while the small migrating nucleus is like the sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be the equivalent of FERTILIZATION . The story of conjugation in P. aurelia is shown diagrammatically in Figure 45 . Soon after fertilization the CONJUGANTS separate . Even before separation , however , the macronucleus has begun to show clear signs of a break-up . It becomes irregular in shape , constricts , breaks into pieces , and these disintegrate more or less completely , leaving only a few dispersed granules . While the macronucleus has been disintegrating , the fusion nucleus has divided three times , giving rise first to two , then to four , and finally to eight micronuclei , four located near one end and four near the other end . The fate of these eight nuclei has been studied by various authorities and their accounts differ in minor details . One account has it that the four micronuclei near the anterior end enlarge and transform themselves into four macronuclei . Of the posterior group of four micronuclei , three disintegrate and dissolve up into the cytoplasm , the remaining one becoming a new micronucleus . This then divides and the process of fission is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subsequent ones is that the four macronuclei have been preformed and need only be distributed to four prospective individuals . These two distributing divisions occur at short intervals . From then on , the binary fission period is kept up until it is time for another conjugation . // The first few fissions are rapid and have been compared to the period of youth ; the later divisions that go on for some time are comparable to the period of maturity ; and the period just before conjugation corresponds to the period of old age . If a Paramecium can not conjugate , it dies . Conjugation appears to be to some extent a process of reorganization or rejuvenation . The Problem of Age and Natural Death. ? It has been said that , except as the result of accident , Paramecium never dies . The body of one individual goes on living in the daughter individuals derived by fission . The parent ceases to exist but it does not die . After a long series of fissions the individuals grow old and would die , often do die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves a complete reorganization of all parts of the body , a breakdown of old structures and a rebuilding of new . The protoplasm takes a fresh start , becomes , as Calkins so aptly says , " germinal . " Conjugation is believed by him to transform ordinary body cells into germ cells . An individual after conjugation is like a fertilized egg , or an organism in its earliest infancy : vigorous , renewed in its energy . We shall see later on that the physical immortality of Paramecium is no different from the physical immortality of germ cells of the higher organisms . The parent lives on in its offspring although part of it dies , namely , that part which has become specialized for maintaining the life of the individual . Even tissue cells of the higher organisms can go on living indefinitely if placed in proper culture media . Nerve cells , connective tissue cells , muscle cells , have been caused to grow when removed from the body . Natural death then is not due to any necessary playing out of vitality in individual cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interrelations of the many differentiated cells and organs of the body of the Metazoa and a defect which is cumulative until the organisms are unable to carry on the necessary functions , and die . " Is Conjugation Necessary ? ? If conjugation serves as a means of rejuvenating a race of Paramecia that has run down or become senescent , could other agencies accomplish the same end ? Woodruff , working with a race of Paramecia that was conjugating every six months , showed that by making a daily change in the culture medium he was able to prolong the unbroken series of binary fissions for thirty-seven months or even longer . It appears // then that the same rejuvenating effect is attained by a varied food as is normally attained by conjugation . The same author discovered one race of Paramecium aurelia that never conjugates . For seven years this race was watched with care and there were no signs of conjugation nor of lowered vitality . On microscopic examination , however , it was found that at regular intervals the separate individuals went through // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no nuclear material was exchanged between different individuals . This so-called ENDOMIXIS ( Fig. 46 ) is interpreted as the equivalent of PARTHENOGENESIS , a type of germinal reproduction found quite commonly among the Metazoa , in which eggs undergo maturation and develop without fertilization . D. CONCLUSION One of the most important generalizations that one arrives at after the study of a fairly complex protozoan organism such as Paramecium is that there is not any very pronounced difference between such an animal and a metazoan animal . We find that in its behavior , in the performance of its metabolic functions , and in its reproduction , it shows striking parallelism with such animals as Hydra or Planaria . The fact that in Paramecium differentiation of organs takes place within the somewhat narrow confines of a single cell , while the others are much larger in size and have many cells regionally specialized for different functions , constitutes an important distinction ; but this is not so important a consideration as that both are organisms , whole individuals , in which the parts are held together by a centralized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental in understanding the relative status of Protozoa and Metazoa than is the Cell Theory . CHAPTER XIII THE PROTOZOA AND THE METAZOA A. PROTOZOA AND THE CELL THEORY IN terms of the Cell Theory a protozoan organism is merely a single independent cell equivalent to one of the many dependent cells making up the tissues of metazoan organisms . We have already shown the inadequacy of this point of view . A whole protozoan is in a larger sense the equivalent of the whole metazoan . In spite of this , however , there is nothing to be gained by denying that Protozoa are cells . The whole situation is well explained by Ritter , as follows : " I wish to point out that while there can be no doubt about the great importance of the fact that in metazoa and metaphyta ( multicellular plants ) cells are parts of the organism , I am unable to see that the fact necessitates , as held by Huxley and Dobell , the exclusion of the protozoa from the cell-theory . It simply establishes in the most uncompromising way the subordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphyta . If the idea be grasped that cells are among the instrumentalities produced by organisms in the course of their development , individual and racial , with which to carry on their various activities , it will become apparent that there can be no objection to modifying the conception of the cell to make it apply to any structure whether a part of or the whole of an organism , which satisfies certain well established criteria . When , for example , it is recognized that certain species of amoebae resemble so closely the white corpuscles of the blood of many animals as never to fail of recognition by good observers , the established principles of biological definition and classification dictate that the two sorts of bodies be given a common , that is , logically speaking , a generic name . " But it must not be forgotten that Amoeba is more than a cell ; it is a whole organism . A white blood corpuscle is only a dependent element playing one useful function in the blood and lymph of a higher organism . 146 // From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paramecia derived from the repeated binary fissions of one individual is in a sense equivalent to a metazoan organism produced by the repeated process of the mitotic division of a single cell , the egg cell ; but this is not the whole story . Even if we could collect and cement together all the products of fission of a Paramecium so that they formed a coherent harmonious mass , we would not have anything equivalent to a metazoan ; for the mass would lack unity and Codosiga cymosa . ( From Calkins after Kent. ) organization . All the cells would be alike both in form and in function . No part of the mass would be in control so as to confer organization or individuality upon the whole . As a matter of fact , there are Protozoa that hang together after fission so as to form colonies . Such a colony is seen in the protozoan species Codosiga cymosa ( Fig. 47 ) . This collection of Protozoa is , however , a cell aggregate , not an organism . B. GERM CELLS AND BODY CELLS Certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , colonies like Codosiga , adhere closely so as to form spherical // colonies in which all the cells remain embedded in a continuous gelatinous matrix secreted by the cell membranes . Some such colonies as Pro-teros on is for example ( Fig. 48 ) , show a certain small amount of regional differentiation of the constituent cells . Those on the outside are collar-flagellate cells like those in Codosiga , but some bold cell ; b , a cell dividing ; c , cell of these collar cells , when well migrate to the interior of the Cambridge Natural History , the colony , where they lose their collars and flagella and divide to form cells that wander back to the surface and reassume the characteristic collar-flagellate form . Here we have a temporary differentiation into vegetative or body cells and reproductive or germ cells . Permanently v differentiated body cells are found in the spheroidal colonial protozoan , Pleodorina , where four out of the thirtytwo cells forming the colony are purely vegetative and do not reproduce , while the remaining twentyeight may be considered as germ cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ordinary colony divides tion consists of six-teen cells arranged // in a ringlike fashion ( Fig. 49 ) . In the process of reproduction each cell in the colony acts like a germ cell , dividing into two , four , eight , and then sixteen cells , after which the original colony breaks up into sixteen young colonies . The process of division in Gonium is extremely like that of a dividing egg in a metazoan organism even in having the first two cleavage planes vertical and the third horizontal . We see then in the colonial Protozoa that we have multicellular aggregates that are almost equivalent to individuals of a higher order , but not quite so , because they lack centralized control and axiate organization . There is no apical end ; no axial gradient . It is only the introduction of centralized control that makes possible a true organism or individual . C. POSSIBLE CONNECTING LINKS BETWEEN PROTOZOA AND METAZOA Some writers have said that there is no sharp line between the Protozoa and the Metazoa . They point to the series of cell aggregates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by imperceptible steps into the other . In order to make the series more complete they introduce into it a number of simple plants such as Pandorina , Eudorina , and Volvox , in which the differentiation of somatic cells and germ cells is clearer and in which the germ cells differentiate into macrogametes and microgametes , usually spoken of as the equivalent of eggs and sperms in animals . Without entering upon a controversy as to whether these organisms are plants , as the botanists confidently claim , or animals , as some zoologists prefer to think , we doubt the advisability of drawing from such an artificial series any important conclusions as to the relationship existing between the Metazoa and the Protozoa or as to whether the Metazoa may have been derived from the Protozoa through steps similar to those shown in this series . It seems logical to believe that the original ancestral living organisms were unicellular and , if so , it seems a necessary consequence that the multicellular organisms have descended from unicellular organisms . It does not follow , however , that the ancestor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like present-day colonial Protozoa . One therefore has difficulty in accepting the statement that there is no hard and fast line between the Protozoa and the // Metazoa . Protozoa as a group are organized on quite a different principle from Metazoa . They may be very simple or very complex , but their differentiation is attained without making use of the scheme of cell multiplicity . Colonies of Protozoa are not comparable with single metazoan individuals , but with colonies of the latter . There is , for example , a very close similarity between a colony of protozoans such as Zoothamnium ( Fig. 50 ) and a colony of metazoans such as Obelia or Bougainvillea ( Fig. 66 ) . Each is a loosely connected group of organized independent individuals , all derived by the asexual division of one original individual and remaining in contact by their basal ends . In each case zooids become specialized as reproductive individuals that break off and swim away . These free individuals in both cases reproduce sexually , and thus give rise to new colonies . There is also no essential difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Paramecium multiplies itself and the equivalent process by means of which the flatworm Planaria reproduces ( Fig. 72 ) . In both cases an organism divides into two daughter organisms , which at first are incomplete in certain respects but soon reconstitute the lacking parts . Thus it is not correct to compare the products of fission of a Paramecium // to the tissue cells of a metazoan organism : these fission products are whole individuals comparable with whole daughter Planaria , which have been produced in the same way . This process of transverse fission is found in much higher animals , such as the segmented worms , in which whole chains of individuals are produced that hold together for life and constitute a new order of individuality . Even more striking cases of the organization of colonies of zooids into coherent , organized groups , that exhibit greater unity than do those of any of the Protozoa , are seen among some of the colonial Hydrozoa . An excellent example of this kind of thing is furnished by the Sea Pens ( Fig. 51 ) . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and experiments have shown that those situated at one level of the axis have different physiological properties from those at another level . Here we have a case of metazoan individuals forming aggregates that tend to lose their individuality in the process of cooperating in the formation of a corporate individuality of a higher order . // An equally good illustration of a superindividual consisting of an organized group of component individuals is furnished by Physalia , the Portuguese Man-of-War ( see Frontispiece ) . Here the hydranths ( individuals ) , some nutritive , some protective , some locomotor , some reproductive , are so organized that the whole complex resembles a single individual . Some writers go so far as to say that a swarm of bees , or even a community of human beings , is in a sense a unit , an organism . If , then , we bear in mind all of these important considerations , we may well conclude that it is hardly a safe procedure to use colonial types of Protozoa as a phylogenetic bridge connecting the two great . subkingdoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the facts to look upon the two groups of organisms as totally independent , neither one derived from the other , but both derived from a very ancient common ancestor . In one of them differentiation is attained without the use of cellular multiplicity and in the other differentiation is attained chiefly through the instrumentality of cellular multiplicity . If our arguments are valid , there is then a sharp line between the Protozoa and the Metazoa which can not be bridged by means of colonial types of PROTISTA . These colonial types are not leading toward a condition equivalent to a single metazoan individual , but to conditions like colonies of Metazoa . By taking this position we are not discarding the Cell Theory as an important principle , but merely restricting it within reasonable bounds and applying the Organismal Theory in a field where it has been neglected . CHAPTER XIV SPONGES ( PHYLUM PORIFERA ) A. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS EVEN though they fail to meet the popular criteria of what animals ought to be , sponges are truly animals . In the adult state they are sessile organisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wharf piles , and therefore incapable of moving about as one expects animals to do . They do not visibly respond by movements when touched , and they display no other signs of animation under casual observation . Why then do we insist that they are animals ? In the first place , they are made up of living cells , usually many thousands of them , each in itself a characteristic animal cell . Moreover , these cells are arranged in definite layers and differ from one another structurally and functionally in accord with the position they occupy in the individual . A sponge then is a real organism , an individual in the technical sense , but its organization is loose and the interdependence of part upon part is relatively slight . An example of a simple sponge is Leucosolenia ( Fig. 52 ) , a species common along the New England coast . Individuals of this species grow in colonies or clusters , and reach a length of about one inch . Each sponge looks like a little slender urn or flask with the bottom fastened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a real mouth in the sense that it is the portal for the entrance of food , yet it is called the oscuLUM ( meaning little mouth ) . Nothing enters the body through the osculum . On 153 // the contrary , it acts as an exit for water and wastes . The mouths of the sponge are myriad , consisting of countless little INCURRENT PORES ( OSTIA ) that dot the whole external surface . It is the presence of these pores that gives the name " Porifera " to the phylum . An animal with hundreds of mouths can not be thought of as very highly organized , for there is no well defined apical region and no single gradient . That a sponge is in truth shown by the fact that if an individual be torn to fragments and these be strained +through the meshes of closely woven silk fabric , the various kinds of cells will be separated one from another . In spite of this complete breaking down of organization the cells can go on living separately and are able to aggregate into small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These and other hand individual is shown in longitudinal considerations have led to the conclusion that sponges are hardly entitled to full rank as Metazoa , but are only slightly more advanced than some of the more elaborate colonies of Protozoa . They differ from protozoan colonies , however , in the fact that definite tissues are differentiated , including a protective external tissue , an internal nutritive tissue , and an intermediate tissue that contains skeletal cells , reproductive cells , and some cells that assist in nutrition . There are also muscular tissues associated with the openings of pores and passageways , and these serve to regulate the flow of water through the body . Because the Porifera are multicellular organisms , // but lack sufficiently definite organization to be considered true Metazoa , they have been assigned by some biologists to a separate minor subkingdom , PARAZOA . B. THE ANATOMICAL PLAN OF A SPONGE If one cut open a sycon sponge , such as that shown in Figure 53 , and examine it under the low power of the microscope , he will find it a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a large cavity , which is in no sense comparable to a stomach or intestine . Radiating from this cavity and in communication with it are numerous canals ( EXCURRENT CANALS ) that end blindly near the surface ( Fig. 54 ) . Between the excurrent canals are similar canals e ? ( INCURRENT CANALS ) , each opening to the out side by a pore ( incurrent pore , or OSTIUM ) and ending blindly near the central cavity . Numer- canals ; 2 , incurrent canal ; 3 , prosopyles ; ous tiny passages ( PRO-S O P Y L E S ) place the incurrent canals in communication with the excurrent canals , so that it is possible for currents of water to pass from the surface into the central cavity . The incurrent canals are apparently merely water conduits , for they are lined with flat pavement cells without other function than that of furnishing a firm , smooth surface . The cells lining the excurrent canals , however , are very different . Each cell is provided with a funnel , or collar , opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which lashes water and suspended food particles into the cell mouth at the base of the collar ( Fig. 55 ) . These then are the food capturing cells of the sponge . // Small nutritive particles are taken into the cell protoplasm , digested , and part of the nutrition passed on to deeper lying cells . The combined movements of the flagella , or whips , are in such a direction that water currents are created toward the central cavity . This is the whole mechanism of water flow , the only superficial sign of life in the sponge . The central cavity is merely a common conduit for conducting to the outside the water expelled from the excurrent canals.The current may be checked by contracting the muscle cells surrounding the incurrent pores . It is to be noted that all digestion is INTRACELLULAR , that is , within the individual cell bodies . Similarly , respiration and excretion is carried out by each and every cell ; for there are no special tissues for into central cavity . these functions . The external surface of a sponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which occur many nuclei . Such a layer , with no distinct cell boundaries but with numerous nuclei , is known as a SYNCYTIUM . Since the living tissues of the sponge are in themselves quite soft , and since the whole life of the animal depends upon the maintenance of a more or less constant form with open passageways for the water circulation , a supporting framework is highly essential . Throughout the deeper layers of the body there is an intricate trestlework composed of calcareous rods and other , more complex units . These may be composed of rods fused together into symmetrical forms , some being shaped like a T , others not unlike the little iron " jacks " used in the favorite game of schoolgirls . These SPICULES , as they are called , constitute the skeleton of the sponge and serve to keep the water passages from collapsing . // Compound sponges of various grades of complexity are essentially of no higher level of organization than the simpler types just described , for they are merely like an apartment building composed of repeated units , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leucosolenia type of sponge as a single apartment we may properly designate compound sponges apartment buildings of varying degrees of size and complexity . Some of the stages of increasing complexity are shown in Figure 56 . The various subclasses , orders , and families of sponges differ rather sharply from one another in the material used for the skeleton and in the shape of the skeletal units . One class ( CALCAREA ) has calcareous ( limestone ) spicules that are sometimes quite elaborate ; asecand class ( HEXACTI-NELLIDA ) has spicules of glasslike silicon ; a a , . third class ( DEMOSPON1111 , iw 0,11,111/11 , rl1 // CIA ) has either no skeleton at all , or a skeleton composed of SPONGIN fibers , or a combination of spongin and silicious spicules . The sponge of commerce is the cleaned and dried skeleton of certain species of Demospongia , having a pure spongin framework . Spongin is a soft , fibrous material capable in the dry state of absorbing much water . The principal sponge of commerce is Euspongia . A million or more pounds of sponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REPRODUCTION The sponge reproduces both sexually and asexually . Asexual reproduction is accomplished by two methods : ( a ) ordinary budding , involving the branching off of a new individual from the external surface of an old one ; and ( b ) internal budding , or gemmulation , a process involving the aggregation of small bunches of cells of different sorts in the form of spherical GEMMULES , each of which is literally an infant sponge . The sexual method is much like that of the true Metazoa . Eggs and sperms are produced in the MESOGLCEA , or deeper tissue , of a single individual , for Grantia is HERMAPHRODITIC . Sperms come in contact with eggs and the latter are fertilized in typical fashion . Embryonic development takes place within the tissue of the parent and the young are later released by breaking out into the canals and being swept out with the current . D. COMMERCIAL VALUE OF SPONGES So important has the sponge industry grown , especially since the vast development of the automobile industry , that marine sponge farms have been established in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Live sponges of the best types ( seed sponges ) are cut up into very small cubes , each cube being wired to a cement disk , which is sunk to the bottom in those parts of the sea known to be favorable for sponge growth , such as , for example , along the Bahama coasts . In a few years these pieces grow to a size suitable for the market . This is but one instance of sea farming , a relatively undeveloped industry . In the future we shall do much more with the products of the sea than we have even dreamed of doing in the past . // E. PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS OF THE SPONGES There exist today no close relatives of the sponges . The closest affinities noted are with a group of Mastigophora ( a phylum of Protozoa ) , known as Choanoflagellata , or collar-flagellates , and especially with the genus Proterospongia . These Protozoa are remarkably like the cells of sponges that line the excurrent canals . Sometimes the choanoflagellate Protozoa form small , but rather massive colonies with internal collarless cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 and 47 ) . Granted then that the sponges have been derived from a group of Protozoa that became extensively colonial and attained a certain degree of division of labor and organization , what relation might they have to other metazoan phyla ? The belief today is that the sponges went up an evolutionary blind alley and have never given rise to any higher forms . The early adoption of sessile life and the failure to acquire well defined axiate organization may have doomed them to a permanent lowly status . As we have already said , the sponge branch of the phylogenetic tree comes off near the bottom and is distinctly a side branch ending in many minor twigs , all of which are only sponges . CHAPTER XV HYDRA ( PHYLUM C4ELENTERATA ) THE fresh-water polyps , Hydra ( Chlorohydra ) viridissima , the green Hydra , and Hydra ( Pelmatohydra ) oligactis , the stalked Hydra , have long been favorite objects for laboratory study ( Fig. 57 ) . They are easily obtainable and , perhaps more important than anything else , they may be studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment are also readily observed . Hydra represents metazoan organization in almost its simplest terms . Relatives of Hydra ( Protohydra and Microhydra ) are conazoan organization . Hydra lives in fresh water , usually attached by its " foot , " or basal extremity , to aquatic plants . It is not fixed in one position , though one might get this impression after watching it for a short time . It slides slowly about on its PEDAL DISK ( pd ) and in the 160 // course of some time it may travel considerable distances . We may characterize Hydra as a SEDENTARY organism in order to contrast it with SESSILE organisms that are permanently fixed . A. GRoss ANATOMY Plan of Organization : Hydra is a true individual with a definite axiate organization . Roughly speaking , the body is an elongated cylinder . At the free end is the mouth and just back of the mouth a crown of tentacles radiating out from the mouth . The rest of the cylinder shows no differentiated organs except at the base , where there exists a pedal disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line drawn through the Hydra from the mouth and HYPOSTOME ( Fig. 57 , B , hy ) to the pedal disk represents the primary axis of the animal . This is the oralaboral axis and is not equivalent to the anteroposterior axis of higher animals , as will be made plain in a later chapter . The mouth and the ring of tentacles represent the apical or controlling region of the individual and the rest of the body is subordinate . It has been shown by Child and others that the rate of metabolism is greatest at the mouth end and that there.is a gradient of lessening rate of chemical activity as one proceeds down the axis . The tips of the tentacles and the lips of the mouth are the most active regions of all and have the highest rates of metabolism . Most authors lose sight of the primary organization of Hydra in their efforts to emphasize the fact that the repeated parts are radially arranged . In the plan of organization this RADIAL SYMMETRY is secondary to the axis of polarity , which is essentially equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the radial symmetry is in contrast with the bilateral symmetry of these groups . All Metazoa have at least a primary axis . They vary with reference to their secondary plan of organization . Sessile and sedentary organisms are likely to be characterized by radial symmetry ; while free-living organisms usually exhibit bilateral symmetry . The Two-layered Structure of Hydra. ? Another feature of the general plan of organization in Hydra is that it is DIPLOBLASTIC ( Fig. 58 , A ) ? by which is meant that the body consists of but two layers of cells , an ECTODERM ( ec ) layer on the outside and an ENDODERM ( en ) layer on the inside . The ectoderm is a protective , sensory , and contractile layer ; while the endoderm is muscular // and alimentary in character . One might compare the two-layered condition of Hydra to that of a thermos bottle , which consists of an outer and an inner cylinder , with the inner cylinder opening at the mouth . In Hydra there is no open space between the two layers , but only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the GASTROVASCULAR CAVITY ( gc ) . It is the only cavity present in the body , for there is no coelom nor any blood nor lymph spaces . This type of cavity differs from similar cavities of most higher organisms in having but one opening , the mouth , and no posterior opening , or anus . It also subserves two functions , that of digestion and that of circulating the products of digestion about the body . It is therefore both a digestive tract and a vascular system ; hence the name , " gastrovascular. " // B. HISTOLOGY OF HYDRA We have already considered the main features of the general organization of Hydra and shall now turn our attention to the cellular composition of the animal . We have before us a true metazoan organism that makes use of cells to gain specialization of regions of the body . There is a physiological division of labor among the cells , some performing only one function , others performing two or three functions . In so far as more than one function is performed by one kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cellular details of the two layers of Hydra , the ectoderm and the endoderm , affords a good introduction to that important branch of morphology known as Histology . We may conveniently describe first those types of cells that are confined to the ectoderm ; second , those confined to the endoderm ; and third , those present in both ectoderm and endoderm. 1 . Cells Confined to the Ectoderm There may be distinguished three types of cells that are characteristically ectodermal : ( a ) epithelio-muscular cells ; ( b ) nematocysts , or nettle cells ; ( c ) reproductive cells . a . Epithelio-muscular Cells. ? Hydra has no cells that are purely muscular in function , but each of the epithelial cells possesses elongated basal processes which extend up and down the cylinder of the body and contain contractile fibers ( Fig. 59 ) . The contraction of these muscular processes serves to shorten the body or to bend it from side to side . The bodies of the epithelio-muscular cells lie side by side like paving blocks with free ends rounded . They serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // body and , by contraction , shortening the body when it is necessary to withdraw the oral end . In addition to this , ectoderm cells of the basal disk have the power of sending out pseudopodial processes by means of which the Hydra moves slowly from place to place . b . Nettle Cells. ? These cells are peculiar to the phylum Coelenterata to which Hydra belongs . They occur over nearly the entire outer surface , being absent only on the basal disk . They are most abundant on the tentacles and on the HYPOSTOME , the crater-like prominence around the mouth . On the tentacles the stinging cells are usually arranged in batteries composed of one piece of heavy artillery ( a large , specialized nematocyst ) in the center and a ring of smaller fieldpieces about it . These curious cells serve as offensive or defensive weapons and are the only means a Hydra has of defending itself or of capturing prey . A nettle cell , or NEMATOCYST ( Fig. 58 , B , n.l and n.2 ) , as it is called when fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of its body and that may be everted or shot out with great violence so as to penetrate the body of enemy or prey . From the end of the thread , a minute drop of poison exudes , which has a paralyzing effect upon animals struck by it . When many nettle cells strike at once , animals much larger than a Hydra may be paralyzed . Each nettle cell is provided with a sensory hair or CNIDOCIL ( Fig. 58 , C , cn ) , which plays the part of a trigger . When certain stimuli affect the trigger , it reacts in such a way as to bring about the discharge of the stinging thread . A detailed study of the origin and development of nematocysts has shown that they are cytoplasmic derivatives of certain cells of the formative ectoderm . Within such a cell there arises a vesicular body , which in the course of development acquires a tough membrane . This vesicle or cyst increases in size until it crowds the nucleus to one side . While the cyst is growing , one part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coiled tube , the " thread " of the nematocyst ( Fig. 58 , C ) . This shoots out when the cell functions as a stinging cell ( Fig. 58 , D ) . The method of uncoiling is similar to that observed when the inturned finger of a glove is flipped out by blowing into the opening of the glove . The exact mechanism of this discharge is not fully understood , but there is evidence that the force exerted in the discharge is due to an increase in the water content of the cyst . This increased internal pressure becomes focused upon the one part of the cyst that // can yield , namely , the inturned threadlike tube , which everts with such incredible velocity that , even though it is slender and delicate , it is able to penetrate resistant tissues such as the skin of larger animals . In endeavoring to show how this is possible , certain writers call our attention to the alleged penetration of straws into tough wood when driven at high speed in a tornado. c . Reproductive Cells. ? Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECIOUS , Or HERMAPHRODITIC ; that is to say , each individual produces both male and female germ cells ( Fig. 60 ) . The germ cells are aggregated into more or less compact masses , called GONADS . The male gonad is called a TESTIS and the female , an ovARY . In certain regions of the body and under certain environmental conditions , a group of undifferentiated formative // cells begins to grow and to multiply . At first the two types of gonads and their contained primordial germ cells are indistinguishable , but later they become very different indeed . In the ovary there is a cannibalistic warfare among the primordial germ cells , the stronger engulfing and eating up the weaker until only one is left , a huge gorged cell filled with the remains of its sisters . In the testis the chief activity has been of another sort : the cells have gone on multiplying until there are immense numbers of minute very active sperms with swimming tails . In the case of ova , numbers have been sacrificed for the sake of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the sperms , size and food have been sacrificed for great numbers and activity . 2 . Cells Confined to the Endoderm There are three kinds of cells found only in the endoderm : ( a ) nutritive-muscular cells ; ( b ) slime cells ; ( c ) albumen cells . These cells are all concerned with the processes of securing or digesting the food . a . Nutritive-muscular Cells. ? These cells are larger and longer than the corresponding cells of the ectoderm ; their free ends bear flagella ( Fig. 58 , B , en ) and also send out processes resembling pseudopodia . At their basal ends these cells have elongated muscular processes that run around the cylindrical body at right angles to the processes of the endodermal muscular cells . Contraction of these muscles elongates the body , while contraction of the ectodermal muscles shortens it . The two sets of muscles together control all movements except the slow sliding movement of the basal disk . The cytoplasm of the endodermal nutritive-muscular cells is much vacuolated in well fed Hydras and contains considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live SYMBIOTICALLY inside alimentary cells . We see then that these cells are quite versatile , performing a variety of functions , each being almost able to take care of itself . b . Slime Cells. ? These cells are used to lubricate the food in order to facilitate swallowing . They are located between the epithelial cells of the mouth region . c . Albumen Cells. ? These are widely distributed elongated cells with slender bases attached to the basement membrane . Not infrequently the free ends of these cells are provided with one or more flagella. // 3 . Cells Found in Both Ectoderm and Endoderm There are three kinds of cells not confined to either body layer , but distributed more or less at random throughout the body of Hydra : ( a ) nerve cells ; ( b ) sensory cells ; ( c ) formative or reserve cells . a . Nerve Cells. ? Specialized nerve cells in Hydra are few in number and confined to the most active region of the body , namely the hypostome or cone of tissue around the mouth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or central nervous system , the center of its coordinated activities . It is this region that directs and unifies the activities of the whole organism . The nerve cells are not in the form of a compact tissue , or ganglion , but lie in a loose interlocking network , the processes of the various cells being united or at least in contact with one another ( Fig. 61 ) . As has already been said , the regions where nervous tissue predominates may always be considered as the center of organization of an animal , and it is interesting to find that in Hydra the nervous system exists in the form of a band around the mouth , a very primitive situation and one that persists even among many of the higher organisms . This seems to imply that , for Hydra , the mouth is the most important region and that feeding is its dominant activity . The only // difference between the nerve cells of the ectoderm and those of the endoderm is that they are much more numerous in the former than in the latter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found chiefly around the mouth and the basal disk . These are slender cells , lying crowded between the epithelial cells and sending out from their bases branching fibers connecting them with the muscular processes of the contractile cells and with the nerve cells . Sensory cells are much more numerous in the endoderm than in the ectoderm ; in addition , those of the endoderm sometimes bear flagella. c . Formative or Reserve Cells. ? There are always present , in the corners made by the tapering basal ends of the epithelial cells , little groups of roundish cells that are not specialized for any particular function , but are always ready for any one of several various lines of specialization ( Fig. 58 , B , f.c ) . Those in the ectoderm differentiate into epithelio-muscular cells , nettle cells , germ cells , and probably also into nerve and sensory cells . Those in the endoderm seem to specialize into various types of endodermal tissues only when repair work is necessary as the result of injury , or when a bud is being formed . Formative cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endoderm. 4 . The Basement Membrane , or Mesogloea A thin homogeneous layer , secreted mutually by the ectoderm and the endoderm , lies between the two body layers ( Fig. 58 , B , b.m ) . In Hydra and in the other polypoid types of Coelenterata the mesoglcea remains relatively inconspicuous , assuming the form of a thin basement membrane , but in the jellyfish types it becomes voluminous and constitutes the main bulk of the body . C. PHYSIOLOGY OF HYDRA 1 . How Hydra Feeds Hydra is a carnivorous animal , voracious and greedy beyond compare . It feeds upon whatever forms of animals it may be able to reach and to sting with its batteries of nettle cells . Usually it has to be satisfied with the capture of small crustaceans or larvae of aquatic animals . Jennings , however , has described a case that breaks all records for greed . A Hydra was found that had swallowed a caterpillar about fifty times its own size . The Hydra 's // body was stretched like a thin film over the body of its prey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the Hydra was on the outside of the caterpillar . Whether the meal was ever digested is not known , but it seems certain that there must have ensued a severe attack of indigestion . Hydras are rarely so greedy as this , their favorite food consisting of creatures of more convenient size , such as the water flea , Cypris . One of these water fleas in swimming about comes into contact with a stretched out tentacle of Hydra and is at once stung by the poisoned darts of the nettle cells . The poisonous material , HYPNOTOXIN , paralyzes the prey , while the threads hold it firmly . With the aid of other tentacles it is passed to the mouth , which opens in anticipation , indicating a nervous connection between the tentacles and the mouth . The Cypris is then forced into the gastrovascular cavity , where it is digested , just as a piece of meat would be digested in a human digestive tract , by means of a pouring forth into the cavity of digestive ferments . Indigestible parts of the animal are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food particles are engulfed by the pseudopodial action of the endodermal cells and are digested within the bodies of the cells . 2 . The Behavior of Hydra The green fresh-water polyp ( Hydra viridissima ) is a good deal livelier than other species and is therefore a better form for the study of behavior . The more sluggish forms have much the same activities , but in a slowed down form . Hydras are usually found attached to the glass bottoms or sides of aquaria , clinging to water plants or hanging head downward from the surface film of the water . They tend to take up a position perpendicular to the surface of attachment . Movements of Hydra while attached to the substratum are confined to those produced by contraction of the muscular processes of the two kinds of epithelial cells . All they can do is to contract by shortening the muscular processes of the ectodermal cells or to elongate through contraction of endodermal muscular processes . Movements may be stimulated by internal conditions , such as hunger , or by external stimuli . 3 . Hunger Movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It contracts the endodermal cells and in so doing extends the body // as far as possible , spreading out the tentacles to all points of the compass . If no food is encountered , it contracts and then extends in a different direction . If this new direction brings no success , it will suddenly contract again and try still another direction ( Fig. 62 ) . This is the equivalent of the TRIAL AND ERROR MOVEMENTS of Paramecium . If the now very hungry Hydra can find no food after repeated trials , it adopts another type of behavior involving a change of headquarters . At first it will simply slide along on its basal disk until it has gone a short distance ; it then goes through trial and error movements again . If still unsuccessful , it adopts more strenuous measures , bending over sideways toward the plane of attachment , attaching itself by the tentacles , releasing the basal disk , contracting the body , and then taking an upright position in a new place . This may be repeated much after the fashion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If no food be encountered ? and none is likely to be under the conditions of the experiment ? the ravenous Hydra resorts to extreme measures , somersaulting instead of looping . This is its last resort in the attainment of speed . The head is bent over and attached ; then the foot is thrown forward over the head and attached again far in advance ; then the head does as the foot has done . Even this gives // no satisfaction , and the Hydra finally contracts down to a lemonshaped mass and becomes very quiet , as though discouraged . It will live for a long time in the contracted quiescent condition . All of this behavior seems to indicate that Hydra is intelligent ; and doubtless it really is intelligent , if we are somewhat liberal in our definition of the term . If ability to modify behavior according to the changing condi-tions of life is intelligence , Hydra is intelligent . being its most impor tant reactions : reacactions to chemicals , actions to temperature changes . a . Thigmotropism ( reactions to con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fixed at all contact stimuli are of primary significance . The normal position of Hydra with the foot attached , and both looping and somersaulting movements , have definite reference to contacts . Hydras are also very sensitive to mechanical shocks such as jarring of the vessel in which they are contained , or to being touched with a solid object such as a glass rod . If one tentacle be touched , others contract , showing transmission of stimuli to the central nervous region and out to 4 . Reactions to External Stimuli A good many different kinds of stimuli affect the behavior of Hydra , the following reactions to light , re- // other tentacles . If one side of the body be touched , it contracts on that side and bends away at the point of local stimulus . b . Chemotropism. ? Hydra does not discharge its nematocysts when mere mechanical stimulation is applied unless the mechanical shock be severe or oft repeated . To cause the discharge a definite combination of both chemical and mechanical stimuli is necessary . This combination is furnished when solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c . Phototropism. ? One may easily observe that , if the aquarium be placed in such a position that the different sides have different illumination , the Hydras are likely to be found on one or possibly two sides , depending on the intensity of the light . Green Hydras tend to gather on the lighter sides of the aquarium unless there is too much direct sunlight . The method by which they reach the area of optimum light is that of trial and error ; that is , continual avoidance of the less favorable of two alternatives will inevitably result in reaching the most favorable region and in remaining there . d . Thermotropism. ? If Hydras are placed in a long aquarium warmed at one end and chilled at the other , they will find by trial and error the region of optimum temperature , and stay there . If the whole environment be warmed , the Hydras become at first more active ; but no migratory movements take place unless the temperature goes above 31 ? C. If the temperature be lowered , Hydra merely becomes less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is approached . D. REPRODUCTION OF HYDRA Two phases are to be distinguished in the life cycle of Hydra and these are comparable to those described for Paramecium . There is an ASEXUAL method of reproduction , much like binary fission , which is called budding ; and there is a SEXUAL method involving the production of male and female gametes ? eggs and spermatozoa ? and the union of gametes , or fertilization. 1 . Budding Hydras reproducing by budding are not uncommon in aquaria kept in laboratories ( Figs. 57 , A , 58 , A , and 60 ) . The first sign of budding is seen in a slight bump on the side of the body ( Fig. 58 , A , b.l ) , usually midway between the mouth and the basal disk . // This bump grows out at right angles to the parent body as a cylindrical branch ( Fig. 57 , A , b.1 ) , and soon develops a crown of tentacles and a mouth at the free end ( Fig. 57 , A , b.2 ) . While growing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parent ; but , when full grown , the budded individual pinches off and becomes independent . Not infrequently two or more buds may be seen attached to the parent body at the same time , so that there exists , for a while at least , a simple colony of polyps . Budding takes place only in well fed , large Hydras . If a budding individual be starved , the bud ceases to grow and will be resorbed by the starving parent . 2 . Sexual Reproduction In our account of the histology of Hydra we have already shown that both male and female sex cells , or gametes , arise through the differentiation of formative or undifferentiated cells of the ectoderm . While these primordial germ cells are at first alike , the history of differentiation of the male cells is quite different from that of the female . The two histories are now to be described separately . This history of the differentiation and matura tion of spermatozoa is known as SPERMA- of TOGENESIS ; that of ova , or eggs , as oOGENESIS. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conical enlarge- ments , which project from the surface of the body . These enlargements are the 60 ) . The testes are the result of regional rapid mitotic division of a group of formative cells in the ectoderm . These cells come to arrange themselves into a number of vertically placed elongated sacs or cysts ( Fig. 64 ) , each of which is a continuous A // mass of cytoplasm containing many nuclei . After the period of multiplication of nuclei is over each nucleus contains the diploid , or somatic , number of chromosomes and is known as a SPERMATOGONIUM . Soon after this the chromosomes unite in pairs , giving half as many double chromosomes as there had previously been single chromosomes . The cells are now full grown and are known as PRIMARY SPERMATOCYTES . These then divide , one member of each of the double chromosomes going to each daughter cell . This is the first maturation division and is a REDUCTION DIVISION , for the number of chromosomes in each cell has been reduced to one half . These reduced cells are called SECONDARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , into SPERMATIDS , which in turn gradually differentiate into the tailed SPERMATOZOA . Any one cyst may contain all the stages of male germ cells from the spermatogonia up to spermatozoa , the former occupying the inner end and the latter the outer end of the cyst . When a considerable number of ripe spermatozoa is formed , the testis ruptures and releases them into the water where they are able to swim about rapidly , and thus to reach the egg . // b . Oogenesis. ? The female gonads , ovaries ( Fig. 60 ) , arise nearer the basal disk than do the testes . The formative cells destined to become the female germ cells divide less rapidly than do those in the testis , and on that account grow larger in size . They are first to be distinguished from ordinary formative cells by their larger , rounder form and by their larger nuclei . A considerable number of primordial egg cells constitutes the female gonad , or ovary ; yet all but one of these potential egg cells are sacrificed for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other formative cells and uses their substance as a kind of yolk ( Fig. 65 , A ) . Finally , the egg , which during the growing and feeding period has been amceboid in shape , rounds up into a sphere , surrounded by a single somewhat stretched layer of epithelial cells ( Fig. 60 ) . Maturation ensues , consisting , as in spermatogenesis , of two divisions ; but here the divisions are very unequal in so far as the cytoplasm is concerned . Two very tiny cells , the POLAR , BODIES , really abortive eggs , are formed ( Fig. 65 , B ) . During maturation the number of chromosomes , in the same manner as in spermatogenesis , is decreased to half of the original number . After maturation the ectodermal covering of the egg ruptures and the naked egg is exposed except at its base . c . Fertilization. ? The exposed egg seems to attract any spermatozoa that may be in the neighborhood . These swim to the egg in considerable numbers and several attach themselves to its surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the sperm is inside of the egg membrane it rounds up into a nucleus and the egg and sperm nuclei unite to form a fusion nucleus in which the full specific number of chromosomes is reinstated . Unless it be fertilized the egg dies and disintegrates within a period of about twenty-four hours . 3 . Embryology After the egg is fertilized the development of a new individual begins . While still attached to the parent body it undergoes cleavage by mitotic division into cells known as BLASTOMERES . Cleavage continues until a hollow ball of cells , the BLASTULA ( Fig. 60 ) is formed . This consists of a single layer of cells inclosing a SEGMENTATION CAVITY . Cells from the outer layer then begin to migrate into the cavity and ultimately fill it up . The inner cells are destined to form the endoderm , and hence the process of GAS176 OUTLINES OF GENERAL ZOOLOGY TRULATION , though not at all typical , has taken place ; for , irrespective of just how the condition be arrived at , the attainment of the two-layered condition is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been going on , the ectoderm secretes about itself a horny layer , which acts as a protective envelope and effectually slows down and practically stops development for a considerable period . The young embryo drops to the bottom and rests for some time , usually passing the winter months in the dormant state . When environmental conditions again become favorable , the shell about the embryo is ruptured and the embryo is freed . The whole body undergoes expansion ; the endoderm , hitherto solid , opens up so as to form the gastrovascular cavity ; the mouth breaks through ; the tentacles develop ; and a young Hydra with its foot attached to the substratum starts out on its lifelong hunt for food . 4 . Regeneration An artificial method of reproducing Hydras is that of cutting a single individual into two or more parts and letting each part reproduce the whole . Regeneration is the process of reconstituting a whole individual or a whole organ from a part . It is a process characteristic of lowly organisms in which there is not too much regional specialization , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A piece of Hydra as small as one twentyfourth of the whole is capable of regenerating an entire animal . E. THE RELATIVES OF HYDRA The Phylum Coelenterata , to which Hydra belongs , is a very large and highly diversified group of animals , consisting of polyps , jellyfishes , corals , and sea anemones . They all agree in having but two body layers ( diploblastic ) ; in having no coelom , or cavity , between body wall and alimentary tract ; in having a gastrovascular cavity with one opening , the mouth ; and in possessing nematocysts . There are three classes of Ccelenterata : CLASS I. HYDRozoA ? including fresh-water polyps , colonial hydroids , some small jellyfishes , and a few coral-like forms . CLASS II . ScYPHozoA ? including most of the larger jellyfishes . CLASS III . ANTHOzoA ? including the sea anemones and most of the corals . // Hydra is probably a degenerate type of the Class Hydrozoa and is therefore hardly representative of that class . Most of the Hydrozoa are colonial in the polyp phase of their life cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the budding of one young polyp . A good example of the Hydrozoa is Bougainvillea ( Fig. 66 ) , in which each individual polyp is the equivalent of a Hydra bud that has failed to detach itself from the parent body . Certain colonial Hydrozoa ( Siphonophora ) have // some of their polyps specialized for locomotion , others for floats , others for defense ( see Frontispiece ) . In fact , it is rather general for the members of a colony to differ somewhat in function . Bougainvillea shows a differentiation into generalized vegetative polyps ( Fig. 66 ) and reproductive polyps or MEnnSJE , which are characteristically umbrella-shaped and swim about freely in the sea . The medusa is a sexually mature individual that produces either eggs or sperms . The egg becomes fertilized and develops into a polyp , which in turn , by repeated asexual budding , forms a colony . Thus we have an alternation between the asexual and the sexual modes of reproduction quite similar to that seen in Paramecium . This is called METAGENESIS , Or ALTERATION OF GENERATIONS . Hydra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the ovaries and testes may be viewed as reduced medusa buds . There are many intermediate conditions that serve to bridge the gap between species like Bougainvillea and Hydra . In the Scyphozoa the medusa stage is highly developed and the polyp stage greatly reduced or suppressed ; while in the Anthozoa the polyp stage is highly specialized and the medusa stage totally suppressed . CHAPTER XVI PLANARIA ( PHYLUM PLATYHFLMINTHES ) A. HABITS AND HABITAT PLANARIA is a common flatworm belonging to the PHYLUM PLATYHELMINTHES . It occurs only in fresh water , usually crawling on the under sides of stones or other smooth objects . The body is several times as long as it is broad . It always moves about with the blunt anterior end foremost . The head end is rather broad with two lateral earlike processes , the AURICLES , which act as tactile organs . The posterior end tapers off to a sharp point . A well-grown animal may be half an inch long by about an eighth of an inch wide . When viewed from the side , the body is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common name flatworms to the group ( Fig. 67 ) . While a Hydra is in contact with solid objects only at its base , Planaria maintains contact along its entire length , about half of its body surface being kept constantly flat against the substratum . Planaria has a very steady , gliding type of locomotion that seems to have no reference to any muscular movements of the body . Its progression is , in fact , due to cilia , which cover the entire surface but are particularly abundant on the ventral side . The worm lays down a smooth roadbed for itself by secreting mucus at the anterior end and then sliding along on it by backward whipping of the cilia. 179 // As it glides along , the head moves from side to side and the auricles extend outward and forward , now to one side , now to the other , as though the animal were feeling its way . B. GENERAL MORPHOLOGY 1 . Four Advanced Characters of Planaria One can readily note that there are present in Planaria four characters not shown in Coelenterata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) anteroposterior axis , dorsoventral axis , and bilateral symmetry ; ( b ) a distinct third body layer , the mesoderm ; ( c ) an excretory system ; ( d ) a true central nervous system . These require detailed description : a . Anteroposterior Axis , Dorsoventral Axis , and Bilateral Symmetry. ? A modern theory as to the relation between the oralaboral axis and radial symmetry of the coelenterates , on the one hand , and the anteroposterior axis , dorsoventral axis , and bilateral symmetry of the flatworms , on the other , deserves careful consideration . This theory holds that the flatworms have descended from some flat bodied jellyfish-like ancestor . Such a form would have had its mouth at the free end of a long hypostome resembling a handle hanging down from the top of the fiat umbrella-like body . The pharynx of such a form would divide into a number of branching radial subdivisions of the gastrovascular cavity . The central nervous system would consist of radially arranged ganglia , repeated at regular intervals along the margin of the umbrella and connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve ring . If in the course of evolution such a jellyfish were to lose the habit of swimming about freely in the water , as many other types of aquatic organisms seem to have done , and were to settle to the bottom for feeding purposes , it would settle down on the oral surface with the mouth next to the bottom . In feeding upon the rich food supply of the bottom it would tend to slide about on the oral surface by muscular and ciliary action , and it would progress sometimes in the direction of one radial axis , sometimes in others . For some unknown reason one of the several radial axes seems to have gained the ascendancy , becoming the new apical end , or head , and the ganglia of that region became the new brain .
