SEEING the Chanin brothers ' name usually meant getting something in your eye , a piece of sand or ground rock from the construction job beside which the sign was nailed . The same name , with milder associations , confronted you in newspaper items describing real-estate deals . What the name stood for was not clear . Even when the old Manhattan Storage Warehouse was knocked down and the yellow pillar of a new building pushed up in terraces to a flagpole fifty-six stories above Murray Hill a good many people did n't know whether the Chanins were hinders or , since the name was well known on Broadway , theatre-owners who had taken up building as a sideline . Only about a year and a half ago their reputation became familiar to those not immediately concerned with building or real estate . At that time a story was going round about a first mortgage bond issue of six and a half million dollars which a bond house had put out to finance their new building . Because of the size of the sum , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of bonds , preparations were made for a long , elaborate selling campaign ; then the books were opened and forty-eight hours later the whole issue had been subscribed . It was a dramatic indication that the public had heard of the Chanins . The incident is impressive , for one thing , because huilders are so rarely recognized You can think of many architects and decorators who are well known , but the men who conceive the necessity for a building , who later carry out their conception , stay anonymous ; the sign is torn off the employment shanty , and the finished skyscraper , its changing shadow in the air , itself takes on a personality as though it were some product of nature , obliterating those who made it . What is unusual about the Cha'Ili 's story is that their achievements are visible ; a whole city of scattered buildings , a hundred and forty-one of them in New York and Brooklyn , including the Fur Center Building , Thirtieth Street Building , the Hotel Lincoln , the Mansfield , Majestic , Masque , Forty-sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chanin Building at Lexington Avenue and Forty-second Street . Many of these are still owned and managed by the Chanin Construction Company , an organization that includes four Chanin brothers : Ir-win S. ( thirty-six ) , Henry I. ( thirtythree ) , as equal , controlling partners ; Sam ( thirty ) , and Aaron ( twenty-six ) in minor capacities . Henry , a trained accountant , attends to the business organization ; Irwin , the engineer , plans the actual construction . Irwin is the one who makes the plans ; ht started things in the first place , and the story of the Chanins ' rise is really his story . TRYING to find a detail that will tell something about Irwin Chanin , I can only say what has been said of many businessmen : that he has most of the characteristics of a competent artist . That this has been said so often suggests a rule : there is a certain kind of intelligence which , though concerned with making money , is essentially an artist 's intelligence , and the work of industrialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it resembles the work of creating art . But though Irwin Chanin may work and think like an artist , he dues not look like one . He is a small , dark-skinned man whose bald forehead and tight clothes make his face look big in proportion to his body . He wears glasses , the two halves of which are connected by an arching , gold bar ; you notice this because his eyes , prominent and intense , underlined with slight shadows , are the most striking feature of his face . When talking about something that interests him he jumps out of his chair and walks around a room , illustrating his ideas with gestures and pantomime ; and at such times his speech is full of metaphors borrowed from the buildingprofession . He has a small mustache and wears a ring with a big colored stone . Henry is quieter , better-lookinn- , Sam , and Aaron , who was hurt in the Times Square subway accident last summer , are normal , healthy young Jews . Although they are seen together as a rule only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the roof of the Chanin Building the day Irwin drove the ceremonial golden rivet that completed the steel frame . I got an idea then what they must have looked like twenty-two years ago , arriving with their parents in Ellis Island from Poltava , Russia . IT was the second Chanin immigra- tion . The first had taken place some twenty years before that , when Simon Chanin , the father , came to try his luck in Bensonhurst , a suburb of Brooklyn . He had made money as a contractor and after saving ten thousand dollars had gone back to Poltava , a sensible move , since with his capital he could live there like a rich man . Because the kids had been born in America the government school would n't take them ; they went to a private school where Irwin , praised by his teachers , decided he would be an engineer . Simon Chanin favored the idea . He saw that going home had not been so smart after all . Faraway warnings of the revolution , beginning to be felt in Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost most of his ten thousand dollars . So in 1907 the Chanins came hack to 13ensonhurst , where Henry went to a business school and Irwin to Cooper Institute . The war interrupted the jobs they were holding after graduation . In 1919 Henry , who had been wounded directing a machine-gun battery , got a bookkeeping job in Washington ; Irwin , who had been in base camps here , went home . As many other young men were doing then , he lived in his father 's house and tried to figure out some way to make a living . During that winter he took stock of what he could do . He had , he remembered , won three scholarships in Cooper Institute and a special prize for designing a double-track railroad bridge . He had worked for his father on building jobs and later for a subway contractor . More recently , on the government job , he had helped to build a factory for poison-gas near Cleveland , Ohio ; here he had been educated to the importance of speed . The major under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civilian job at a hundred a week . Chanin refused because he thought that somehow he would find a wen to make more money himself . IN spite of the general depression of business at that time , the builders around Bensonhurst were making money buying land and putting up cheap houses on it . The method was to finish the houses outside and let the buyer decide how he wanted the in-side . The houses were almost all alike , thin-walled , with new sidewalks , lawns without grass , imitation hard-wood panelling . Chanin went with the salesmen who were showing the houses and listened to the criticisms of the customers . He thought of im-provements that would make houses of this kind look better and decided that if he could raise the ? ? money he would go into the building business himself . Now came the first step in his rise , a step which at the time it we , carried out seemed , and was , an almost impossible feat . Somehow Chanin raised the money to build two houses at ten thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking a thousand dollars down payment ; he let them go for a hundred . A hundred dollars was all the money Chanin had . He borrowed the life-savings of the girl he was engaged toabmit three hundred dollars . Friends of his father lent him enough to bring his capital up to a thousand . He borrowed the remaining nineteen thousand from local bankers by showing them the major 's telegram and convincing them that if his scheme was a failure he would pay them hack in other ways . He started to build the houses . Most of the carpenters and plasterers working for him had cars ; he had none and so he rode out to the job every day on a bicycle . He was successful . The artistic details of construction which he had planned with such joy had the effect he had estimated ; he sold the houses before they were finished for a six-thousand-dollar profit ; a little later lie wrote to Washington and asked his brother Henry to come home to look after the office work of his expanding projects . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a forty-tenant apartment house that was immediately rented to capacity . Other builders copied their cottages rind went on copying them after the demand had been filled . The Chanins figured these builders would sell out for a loss . A tenant would buy for ten thousand dollars a two-family house that in normal times would cost thirteen or fourteen thousand ; he would rent half of it fur enough to pay all his expenses . He would tell his friends about his good luck until , by degrees , a new market - would be created for the little houses . This was exactly what happened . The Chanins had traded t h e i r apartment house , heavily mortgaged , f o r rows of two-fm-ily houses left unfinished by a discouraged builder . They so l d these houses , built garages , stores , markets to go with them , and then decided there was nothing more for them to do in Bensonhnrst . By this time they had an office in Brooklyn . It was small and dark , the rent was high . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office building . An old friend , one of the title company 's vice-presidents , tried to persuade them to give up their foolhardy scheme . Brooklyn did n't need any more office buildings , and if it did , why should they build them ? Irwin Chanin called the vice-president 's stenographer and dictated a prediction of the profits to be made in office buildings . He said lie would come back in a year and have it read , but even eight months later this became unnecessary . By that time the Chanins had started and already sold two buildings , and were ? beginning to study values in ew York . MHE Fur Center Build -- L ing was their first project on this side of the river . They had found that the wholesale fur trade , concentrated in the West Twenties , needed new quarters . Their building , supplying an old de-mand , madernon-ey , right away , and Irwin Chapin turned his attention to theatres . For the past few years he had been using his imagination principally to detect business opportunities . He saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need for more theatres . This alone would have been enough to make him build theatres of his own , but he had another inducement as well . His interest in plays , as in most forms of artistic expression , had set him thinking about theatres a long time before . As a boy he had sat in the gallery , going in by a side door . He had always disliked that . In his own theatres everyone would go in by the same door . Building them , he revived the talent for unusual detail that had made him successful in the early days in Bensonburst ; he made the orchestra and balcony seats unusually wide , comfortable , saved space in the entrance foyers , improved the acoustics , and gave the actors better dressing-rooms . He got so interested that he hired David Burton as play di rector and began hacking plays himself . Sometimes he pot up alI the money ; sometimes another producer shared the risk . Before he quit , Chanin lost an amount variously estimated at between twenty-five and thir ty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant 1 . success in Europe , was his worst flop as a producer . He made up for it immediately with a new idea bigger than any of his others . Late one night , instead of going home to Brooklyn , the brothers called up six New York hotels to get a room and found they were all full . Here , obviously , was the suggestion for a new investment , and the Chanins put up the thirty-story Hotel Lincoln at Eighth Avenue and Forty-fourth Street . For some time now , S. W. Straus &; Company had been backing almost all the Chanins ' ventures in New York . With money in the bank and new confidence in his own ideas , Irwin gave up all pretense of routine and worked night and day on plans , details . He drew pictures himself of the kind of furniture he wanted in the lobby of the Lincoln , sofas and chairs the curves and angles of which represented the roofs and bridges of the city . He designed one frieze to show the shadow of a Line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is the tire of a Mack truck . He had lamps made to look like safes and a fountain like an office building . He was n't satisfied with making designs ; he sometimes worked even on the material of the decorations , taking the brush out of a painter 's hand to show him what he wanted . Naturally , he is n't precise  --  nn artist-industrialist understands efficiency in its customary sense . Irwin Chanin 's activities confuse his employees ; his secretary , for instance , can not make any guess at the time he will give each appointment . With a list of people waiting to see him he may go out with the first one who comes and work with him till midnight . But his organization , too , is one of the things the details of which absorb him ; once a year he calls in each of his cm-ployees to hear complaints or suggestions . He has made up a set of aphorisms which he frequently quotes . " If you give people the best you can , and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and give you money and everything . " " Money is the easiest thing in the world to get . You just have to have ideas and it will come to you  --  why , it will pour in . ' ' Coming from a man well known for his ability to drive a bargain , these statements are , nevertheless , probably sincere . I do n't believe he dues think first about money , but about ideas for getting ; money , and his enthusiasm is for the success of the idea to which money is a testimonial . people will think high-hat if they mornings , Irwin drives across bridge in his Pierce or his Cadillac or , if he is late , gets into the subway at Atlantic Avenue . He smokes cigarettes , rarely drinks . Married in 1920 to a girl from Bensonhurst , he has three children and a country place in Davenport , Westchester ; he plays golf once in a while but likes fishing and swimming better . Every Saturday and Sunday in the summer he goes fishing in Peconic Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , eighteen hours a day . He and Henry sign cheques on a joint business account . Each is insured for a million dollars for the benefit of the Chanin Construction Company . IHAVE left out a lot of facts about 1 Irwin Chanin that are interesting but that fit too neatly into the success stencil . His career is not important because it is so typical of successful careers , but because it is a good portrait of the type of big-businessman who has the talents and impulses of an artist . A story that illustrates best what I mean is one he tells to illustrate something else : how , when the Chanin Building was almost finished , he took two friends , a painter and sculptor , to the roof . He showed them first all the details he prizes so much : the twenty elevator cabs , all different , all made of imported woods usually used only for jewel boxes and violins ; the theatre for industrial conferences on the fiftieth floor . When at last they climbed an iron ladder onto the topmost terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked at the view . " Why , they looked around  --  you know what you can see ? They looked around , like that  --  they were struck dumb . . . . " Imitating their expressions , he opens his mouth and eyes wide , lifts his hand . But somehow he manages to suggest not his friends ' but rather his own perpetual wonder and excitement at what he has done , the excite-
