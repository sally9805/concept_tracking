txt Europe will never agari9 be as it was . Standards ' of value , units of money , Miriam relations have all changed . The independent woman has come into being in France . She is no longer dependent upon a man . She is free to rise and to fall , conscious of her own independence , her own strength and resources . Women and girls now move about with the freedom that characterizes America . Wives . and daughters will pick up their traveling bags and cross the channel or the Mediterranean without maid or chaperone . If the head of the household protests that his daughter must not travel alone , she replies : " Did I have a maid or a chaperone when I nursed the soldiers of France ? Did I have a companion when I ran the motor car through the war lines ? " And papa realizes that the old ' era has passed and that a new era has arrived not only in the nation , but with the family . THE ART OF FRANCE Art and music are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support them . The Governnient subsidy of a million and a half francs to the opera continues , but it has not been increased . Singers are underpaid in cornparisen with changed cost in living . The opera season is farmed out and the good citizen who undertakes the contract for pfoviding music and singers is helped out quietly by.a syndicate of his good neighbors , especially those-who draw incomes from America and wfio are internationally patriotic . But France still has its civic pride and good taste . If it can not build or maintain monuments oeart , it will preserve what it has . Therefore the chief of police recently notifies bankers and shopmen on the Place Vendome that no large signs are allowed and that such displays must come clown . Locations and.names can be noted only by modest signs on the windows . Government control has been removed from food and regulation of profiteering has begun . But control of money is still with the Government . You are not allowed to leave France with more than 5,000 francs in bills or $350 , nor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain sum without Government permission . If you want to pay money in any form out of France you must show to the Government the legitimate commercial transaction that is behind it . THE GERMAN TERROR France stands in terror of the German mark , German industri , and German organization . Ske does not mean to be surprised by assault , either physical or financial . She will never forget the words of the German statesman : " This war has been only an incident in the struggle of the races . " The French children in their Cradles are to learn the story of the war and beware of the Ilun for more than one generation , as the German'ehild was warned in the nursery to beware of his act or the Russian bear would get him . Only Witte knew , and Dr. Dillon has clearly revealed it , that there was no Russian bear ; only a Russian bearskin with no national strength or vitality in its sinews or veins . The problem of France and her allies is how to Germany , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frightened et the industrial prosperity of Germany and her apparent ability to undersell the world in ships , locomotives , rails , coal , metals and fabrics and do it as an undernourished and underfed race without gold or silver  --  only a papermark . Ilow Germany can maintain her industries with coolduat and lignite , yet send 2,200,000 tens a month of chat in reparations into France , is something beyond ordinary comprehension . Germany voted two years ago at the time of the revolution an eight-houi day , but in the eyes of the French the German is a rascal who works nights to produce for Himself , conceal his wealth and build airplanes and bombs in hidden quarters in preparation for eating up France at a single gulp when the Allies have taken their eyes off him . The Erenchnuin sees the Englishman again immersed in trade , protecting his commerce and his foreign markets . France not only loves the American boy who so gallantly came to her rescue , but she looks with longing eyes at the " fabulous " country across the ocean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American bankers : She does not see that by reason of the war the United States has now a bigger debt on a gold basis than France , that the war cost the people of the United States a little bit more than was its cost to either England or France , because we had to travel so far to get to the field and had wage and consumption per man so much higher . France does not see that when England borrowed $500,000,000 in the Stutee , she got only 10% of It for her own service , while France got 60% of it and Russia got the balance . TILE AMERICAN SZRUGGLE France does not see the struggle in which the United States is engaged to save what remains in the world of present possibilities of capital accumulation for the world 's advancement . She does not see our struggle to save out transportation both for commerce and income  --  transportation ruined by war 's labor inflation . France sees in the readjustment a hundred thousand men idle in France but does not see a million more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the United States unemployment has increased the past year by more than 3,000.000 while we are trying to translate a 35% reduction in wholesale prices into retail prices and reduced cost of living . She knows nothing of $3,000,000,000 worth of goods in the United States in warehouses and railroad terminals and on docks " by cancelations . " Yet it is an old story with us . France knows nothing yet of the United States government survey of Europe that shows 12,000 automobiles in European ports in February against which drafts were unpaid . If the figures were put before her . she would only exclaim : Whnt a " fabulous " country ! What " inexhaustible " bankers ' capital ! FREE AMERICA : And the free air of the American business man confirms her . He leaves his financial . troubles the other side of the ocean and jaunts over Europe with the carefree air of one with an assured income tlfough Europe crumble beneath his feet . I asked it Chicago business man in Paris what He found in Spain . He replied : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Whitt about the 300 business men murdered Barcelona ? " " I did n't hear anything about it when I was there . Why . we have more murders than that in Chicago . " INTERNATIONAL NEWS NOT ** L It is a pity that the international despatches of the world , like the populpr press the world around , deal mostly with crime , accidents . riots , fires . strikes and losses , and have almost nothing concerning the economic , constructive and upbuilding factors of the world . Yet it is news of hell and never news of heaven that interests . Strikes and riots in Italy and Spain make good copy in America , although they unnecessarily interrupt travel and business and give views of the world , quite out of balance . So in London and Paris . one eon get all the scandal . , negro lynchings , railroad accidents and industrial upheaval in the States that he could ever find at home . but he gets little else as American.news in the European press . THE LERAUDY FORTUNE In Paris you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the settlement of the affairs of Jacques Lebaudy who was unknown in the United States when he was murdered at his country- home on Long Island . People wondered that a man of such fortune could live unknown in America . They doubted stories of the Sunday sensational preis concerning this " Emperor of the Sahara . " As the ruler of the desert of Africa , he was , of course , a fiction or a madman , but as an inberitar'of great wealth a note of financial interest may noW be made . A SUCCESSFUL yoursatt Lebaudy 's father was the only man in the world who ever successfully cornered a commodity of worldwide production and consumption and got away with the profit . He cornered the world 's sugar market and took a profit of $25,000,000 . He was a merchant and refiner of sugar and a close student , not only of his own business , but world : wide economics . He studied the figures of the Sues Canal , made , heavy investments therein and sold them for ten times their cost . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a sharp political contest . At the end he left $45,000,000- in equal parts to three children . The $15,000,000 fortune of Jacques was found at his death divided between investments in England . France and the United States . The litigation following resulted in a division of 50-30. one-half to the Lebaudy family in Paris and one-half to the daughter and her mother in America . IAN INTERNATIONAL TAN PROBLEM The $1,000,000 were gotten over from England withThis brought Bunau-Varilla again to his . feet  --  or rather to his foot for he gave one leg to his beloved country in the war  --  and he sent a bombshell into the Colombian legation . He showed that the Republic of Colombia , was formed in December , 1819 ; that Panama rose against the Spaniards two years later and conquered unaided her own independence and then ! ' spontaneously joined the federal Republic of Colombia as an independent and sovereign gate . " Colombia having tried to curtail this sovereignty , the Isthmus seceded in 15-30 in 1831 and in 1841 . When her independence and sovereignty were again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in no case should the Isthmus he incorporated with Colombia " under a central system of government . " LIBERATING PANAMA AND rue : CANAL When the central government was formed , Panama was alone recognized as " a federated independent and sovereign state . all the other parts of the republic being under a central system of government . " Panama seceded a fourth time in 1860.1 on account of violation of her rights , anti agreed to , return to the federation " as an autonomous , independent and sovereign state , provided that the rights of autonomy , independence and sovereignty would not be curtailed or suppressed . " ' Phis sovereignty was gradually suppressed under military pressure and then taken away by force in 1885 . The opportunity to recover what bad been stolen by Colombia occurred in 1908 when the Isthrnians again recovered their own liberty and the liberty of the world " to use the Isthmus as a passageway . " JUSTIFICATION 1,011 UF . LESSON 'S Let us turn now to another chapter of history that has not been published . On Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , were sentenced to five years ' imprisonment in France for an obvious fraud  --  the taking of money for a chimerical scheme , The proof of the fraud was the statement of the de Lesseps that the Canal traffic could be estimated at seven million tons . Nevertheless the champion of the Canal , and of France , Bunau.Varilla , had declared on Sept. 20 , 1892 , that the traffic through the Panama anal would be at least ten million tons after seven years ' commercial operation . The figures of the Panama Canal traffic for 1920 have , just been issued . They show 10,278,265 net ' tons of commercial vessels passing ' through the Canal exactly seven years after its commercial operation . Ferdinand de Ltsseps long since passed to the rewards of another sphere , but his son Charles , at . the age of 80 years , was able to view these figures of justification . AMERICAN HONOR It-will be difficult in the future to have removed the stigma of ! a false accusation against the honor and good name of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these took Panama from Colombia ror restored the sovereignty of the republic of Panama . That credit belongs entirely to the man who started to save - the honor of France by having the Panama Canal built and to this end alone and singlehanded conceived and executed the Panama revolution without an action of any kind on the part of the United States . AMERICAN ' PROGRESS But the destiny of the United States is to go forward . She is admittedly poor in politeness , apologies or explanations . But she delivers the goods and from her English ancestry has inherited a silence about it . The coal squabble between France , Germany and England seems on the other side of the water small potatoes . In 1913 these three great European countries produced 625,000.000 tons of coal and the United States alone produced 517,000,000 tons .
