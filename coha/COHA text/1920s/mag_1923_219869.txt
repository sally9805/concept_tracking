It will be one of the greatest of blessings if the Metropolitan gives Don Giovanni next year . This is a masterpiece that one rarely gets a chance to hear . The basso that can sing and play the role of that prodigious Don Juan Tenorio , who was such a favorite among the virgins of Spain , is seldom to be found . The Metropolitan now , however , has a man with a reputation for singing Don Giovanni . He is Michael Bohnen , who made his American debut in the middle of the season . Bohnen is that exceptional phenomenon among singers , a man of high intelligence and culture . He is distinctly a man of parts . His voice is fine , big , fresh and young . He sings with skill and excellent understanding and is really a masterful actor , and , indeed , has a reputation in Germany as a nonsinging and even nonspeaking actor . He has had much experience and success as a player for the motion pictures . He is , too , an athlete , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany and a boxer who , if he may be a little bit slow and cumbersome for American boxing ideals , is quite a paladin with the fists in Central Europe .
