txt LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE cling to the inch in expressing the dimensions of their objectives and mirrors . It is a regrettable offence against the majesty of the metric system , but it must sometimes be committed if we do not wish to be " out of it . " Nothing resembling canals is seen on observing Mars in the few telescopes of great power which are at the disposal of the observatories of Europe and America . With these the surface of Mars appears powdered with very numerous small patches whose distribution shows no symmetry . As the telescope becomes less ' powerful ( the power of any telescope or at least its resolving power may be diminished by using diaphragms ) , these small patches seem to coalesce with each other , and to form chaplets and even regular lines . These are the " canals " ! Thus , with the supertelescope of 30-in. aperture of the Lick Observatory in California , which is on the top of a mountain in an exceptionally clear atmosphere , the celebrated astronomer Barnard never saw on Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals . " He announces , on the contrary , that the spots on the Martian surface always appeared to him very irregularly distributed , while on observing with less powerful telescopes he acknowledges having seen straight-line appearances which became clearer and more numerous as the telescope became more feeble ! Now the Lick tele- // scope is the instrument with which the same Barnard discovered the fifth satellite of Jupiter , a small star only 30 miles in diameter . This suffices to show the respective values of the observer and his instrument . The most powerful telescope in the world , more powerful even than the Lick , is that of the Yerkes Observatory near Chicago . Its object-glass is 36 in. in diameter . To some person who , in connection with the sensational declarations of Lowell , asked him what this unique instrument showed on Mars , the eminent Director of the Yerkes Observatory , Mr. Frost , replied by the following telegram , which shows a remarkable mixture of Roman brevity and Anglo-Saxon humour : " Yerkes telescope too powerful for canals ' ! " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomers . Clearly no one is a prophet in his own country . If we now pass to the European observatories , and particularly those of France , we arrive at the same conclusions . The most powerful telescope of France is that of the Observatory of Meudon . The astronomers who have examined Mars with this great instrument have seen nothing resembling canals . Among these observations those of M. Antoniadi must be particularly singled out because this astronomer is among those who , having formerly studied Mars with more feeble instruments , had long seen and // indicated in his diagrams a large number of " canals " on the planet . From all this it takes only common sense to conclude a priori that undoubtedly the " canals " of Mars do not exist objectively on the surface of the planet . It is in fact inconceivable and inadmissible that objects revealed by medium telescopes , and seen better as their power diminishes , objects which no longer appear when they are very powerful , should really exist . But a denial is not a sufficient explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted have independently observed with telescopes of low power the appearances which have been called " canals " on Mars . The geometrical arrangements of these " canals " agreed in the different observations . How is this possible ? How is it that with a feeble telescope one sees things which can not be seen with a powerful one ? The explanation is very simple . Various savants have contributed to establish it . Notably the muchregretted Charles Andre , Director of the Lyons Observatory , who was one of our own pioneers of that science of astronomical physics which is now so flourishing in America . This is it . The particular power which telescopes have of distinguishing detail is called the separating // power . This name is derived from the fact that if we observe in the sky those curious systems called double stars , constituted by two neighbouring suns revolving round each other , the two components are not clearly separated except with powerful telescopes . Otherwise the two points seem joined into one . Now we know ? that is to say , we calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater the greater the diameter of the objective . The two components of a double star seen clearly separated with a certain objective , are finally confounded if a sufficiently small diaphragm is interposed . The same phenomenon is seen when two narrow parallel lines are traced on paper . On moving away from them a moment arrives when they appear confused . At a certain distance one does not know how many stripes a colonel or general has on his sleeve , and these stripes seem to form a single golden patch . In the same way , the eye does not distinguish directly the fine pattern of a process photograph which does appear under a magnifying-glass . Similarly , the small distinct and separate spots on Mars seen in the larger instruments , appear in instruments of smaller power conglomerated , anastomosed , and joined together by lines . But why are the apparent lines , which are optical illusions , straight and not curved ? This is a fact not yet sufficiently explained by physiologists , but // the reality of which has been demonstrated by numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote one , due to the celebrated American astronomer , Simon Newcomb . Newcomb had , drawn on a white disc a series of dark patches , placed irregularly and in such a manner as to obtain an appearance roughly analogous to the image of Mars in a very powerful telescope . Numerous famous astronomers , and particularly Barnard , placed at a distance from this model , so that the separating power of the eye was greatly diminished , and invited to copy it , traced designs on which these separate patches were joined by straight lines . The curious thing is that it was just Barnard , who had never seen any " canal " on Mars , who drew of this model a design most closely resembling Lowell 's Martian images . Finally the Italian astronomer Cerulli showed that with a sufficiently feeble telescope , or one sufficiently stopped down , we may see on the moon itself appearances identical to the so-called " canals " of Mars . But the apostles of these " canals " did not consider themselves beaten . They have appealed to small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell , on which are seen straight lines analogous to the " canals . " To this M. Charles Andre has opposed the strong argument that the optical defects due to insufficient separating power are the same in photography as // they are in eye-sight . The sensitive plate is nothing but a sort of registering retina which faithfully records even the faults of the images received . In confirmation of this point of view , we may cite a curious experiment of Messrs . Lumiere , of Lyons , the celebrated makers of photographic plate . If we photograph a certain diatom , Pleurosigma angulatum , with two objectives , the second of which has a small separating power , we find that the separate points which cover this diatom , and which are clearly distinct on the photograph given by the first objective , are joined by straight lines on the photograph given by the second . It happens that Mr. Lowell confesses in his last work that he did not succeed in photographing the " canals " of Mars until he had stopped down his objective considerably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hale , the learned astrophysicist of the Mount Wilson Observatory , photographed Mars with the giant telescope of that observatory , a unique instrument with a wonderful mirror 60 in. in diameter . The photographs thus obtained in a perfect atmosphere , and with an instrument of unrivalled separating power , show on Mars a mass of fine detail hitherto unknown . They do not show the least trace of the so-called rectilinear " canals " of Schiaparelli , Lowell , or their French followers . // All this brilliantly confirms the remark of Newcomb : " The numerous speculations put forward on the habitability of Mars are fancies which are not based on any positive fact of observation . " To put it more precisely , we may , I believe , conclude that the famous " canals " of Mars do not exist , or at least that they do not exist on Mars . They are not purely subjective phenomena . They are instrumental appearances , due to the optical defects of medium telescopes , and particularly to their low power of separation . If Mr. Lowell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of Mars indicates a human labour which can not possibly be doubted " ( he was wrong to say human because not all intelligence is necessarily human ) , it is because this human labour is simply that of Schiaparelli , of Lowell himself , and his imitators . They have seen " canals " in Mars , just as they could have seen stars if they had knocked their eye against the telescope . It is a pity . It would have been very pleasant to believe in the proof of the existence of this cyclopian network of canals of irrigation , the work of a high superterrestrial civilisation . For the present , unfortunately , we must continue to think that no manifestation of intelligent life is known on any other planet but our own . This does not mean that thinking organisms only exist on the earth . I am even // inclined to be convinced of the contrary . It only means that this phenomenon , if it exists , has hitherto escaped us on account of the clumsiness of our means of observation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Imagination is not always error ; it is often truth which can not be proved , or at all events , is not yet proved . So the famous " canals " of Mars are simply optical illusions . What was long considered the evidence of a great civilisation , established on our neighbour in space , does not objectively exist . But what shall we say of those mysterious Hertzian waves which have been captured on earth , and thought to be wireless signals from the Martians ? In the absence of the non-existing " canals , " are they not the long-expected proof that there is somewhere another inhabited planet ? It was a conversation , or interview , with Marconi , reported with scare headlines by the English newspapers , which brought us the startling news that Hertzian signals of extra-terrestrial origin had been registered . The compilation and comparative examination of signals by the various Marconi stations has shown on various occasions Hertzian waves which obviously did not come from known radio-telegraphic stations , and which no doubt were from a source far from the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations separated by thousands of miles . Well , before assuming that these extra-terrestrial waves are intelligent signals , we must ask if they can not have been caused by natural phenomena unconnected with any conscious will . The Hertzian vibrations have indeed been discovered by purely artificial means , but are there not in nature conditions analogous to those complicated ones which , in the laboratory , give rise to waves ? To this question nature replies in the affirmative . The Hertzian waves are of electric origin , and are produced by an oscillating spark . Now there are oscillating sparks which are not produced by our engineers : the electric discharges of storms and lightning . Thundering Jupiter had preceded Hertz by a long time , but we did not know it . Thus science often consists in discovering things which existed from all eternity , I mean before mankind existed , but which our coarse senses did not perceive . It consists , in a word , in prolonging or increasing our sensitiveness , our feeble powers of perception , and so to raise the deceptive veils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists in creating realities which did not exist , but of which only the possibilities or conditions were present . It is then that knowledge becomes power . Thus , a great number of substances created // by organic chemistry have never existed in nature , and mankind has added them to creation . For many years , and since the foundation of radiotelegraphy , certain savants , notably Popoff in Russia , Tommasina in Switzerland , and Fenyi in Hungary , registered Hertzian waves emitted by terrestrial storms by means of wireless telegraph apparatus . The electric discharges of our atmosphere are powerful generators of electro-magnetic oscillations . As these waves can be perceived at a great distance , they allow us to announce the presence of a storm which would otherwise remain unknown . We can even tell whether the storm is approaching or receding , increasing or diminishing . It gives us a real prediction of storms a short time ahead . Warning services have been established on this principle in the United States . These facts , and others which would be too long to enumerate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sciences that the sun must necessarily emit , besides its heat rays and luminous rays , a great abundance of intense Hertzian waves . This results a priori from the very nature of these waves . If the luminous waves act upon our retina and other waves do not , it is only due to a sort of physiological accident , as expressed by Henri Poincare , who also says : " To the physicist the infra-red does not differ more from the red than the red does // from the green , the wave length being greater in each case . That of Hertzian radiations is still greater . It is only a difference of degree . " Other considerations , no longer derived from the experimental or theoretical analogies of physics , but drawn from the facts themselves , those despotic masters of ideas , lead us irresistibly to the conclusion that the sun is a gigantic radiator of electric waves , and that these must be produced there under the same conditions as those of our laboratories and our atmosphere , except that the scale of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrestial crust is strongly electrified and is such that the earth is negatively charged with respect to the air . The electric field of our atmosphere is very powerful . There is a difference of potential exceeding 100 volts per metre of altitude on the average . Very strong electric discharges are produced in the air whenever violent mechanical disturbances , cyclones , certain stormy depressions , or volcanic eruptions , break up the equilibrium of the strata of electrical level . These discharges produce , as we have seen , intense Hertzian waves . We shall see further on , in studying the sun , that its surface is constituted by photospheric clouds , or " rice grains " animated by movements so rapid that the solar images vary from one minute to another , // and that the most formidable cyclone on earth has only an infinitesimal speed in comparison . Similarly , the lower part of the solar atmosphere is subject to perpetual and violent eruptions , as shown by the spectroscope . All these movements must generate electric discharges similar to those of our storms , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . Spectrum analysis leads to the same conclusion . It has shown , notably through the beautiful researches of M. Deslandres , that the eruptive protuberances of the solar atmosphere which decorate the black edge of the moon with red flames during total eclipses , are electrically illuminated , and are produced by discharges corresponding to those of terrestrial storms . Thus we were led to demonstrate that the sun must emit Hertzian waves , and that this emission must be particularly intense in the regions and at times of great perturbation , that is to say , in the region of sun-spots and faculae ? and at the time of maximum of sun-spots . It seems exceedingly probable that the Hertzian waves of cosmic origin registered at the Marconi stations are just these solar electric waves . Before attributing these Hertzian signals , received from celestial space , to an imaginary interplanetary conversation , to some friendly telepathic or telegraphic correspondence of our astral neighbours , it // is obviously simpler to look for the cause among ordinary natural phenomena . It is true that the taste for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those marvels which cradle the eternal infancy of humanity , and which have given us such delicious trifles as The Arabian Nights . To the philosopher only that is marvellous which is also true . The story of the Sleeping Beauty is wonderful . But I find it much more agreeable than surprising . If Louis XIV had been asked what he found the more surprising : that a beautiful girl could really sleep in an enchanted wood for centuries , until a Prince Charming came to wake her up ; or that he could speak softly and in a natural tone from Paris to London , what would he have replied ? I suppose he would have locked up the prophet of the telephone in the Petites-Maisons , and have made him who announced the other news a Gentleman-in-Waiting . Especially as he had every interest in cultivating the belief that Prince Charmings are possible . This does not hinder several American professors , whose names I need not mention again , from making renewed efforts to catch the radio-telegrams of our astral neighbours during the next opposition of Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as 9 miles in order to receive the Martian telegrams more easily . The result was negative . This Professor , 62 LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS ? who , in order to catch something at 57,000,000 miles , rises 9 miles into the air at the risk of losing his breath and breaking his neck , reminds me of the hero of some great writer . If I remember rightly , a good old captain who had to teach his men direction-finding by night during manoeuvres , got the teacher , who represented science in the company , to show him the Pole-star . Then , after having looked for a moment at the little star twinkling overhead , he shouted : " But they will all sprain their necks . Let the whole company move back fifty paces . " Why do people persist in wishing that elsewhere , even in the nearest suburb of our solar system , there should be beings similar to us , who devour each other and who think , and therefore suffer ? Is it not wiser perhaps to consider organised life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in time ? Nothing has yet proved that life exists anywhere but down here . Certain proud spirits will rejoice in this . In the mute symphony of the golden starry orbs , the cries ascending from the earth are a discord for those whose soul loves an impassive silence . Yet the social instinct in man has always induced him to dream of distant worlds , like ours , where ephemeral conscious beings are born , move about for a short time and are then dissolved . Such a belief is , indeed , connected more closely // than seems likely at first with politics and history . The face of the world might have been different if Aristotle , instead of imagining the stars made of a divine substance , essentially different from the earth , had believed them to be inhabited . He would certainly have taught this opinion to his restless pupil Alexander , and the despair of this young hero in imagining the existence of nations escaping from his domination , would have perhaps made him renounce his plan of conquering this little earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even many who profess science , are less jealous of their place in the universe than of their rank on the small steps of the human ant-heap . Yet , for people capable of reflection ? and there are some , whatever the pessimists may say ? the belief in the habitability of the planets is an excellent antidote to the two most terrible diseases that exist : ambition and restlessness . Do not be surprised at my discussing the astral plurality of life with aid of arguments so foreign to positive science . There are , as we have seen , no better arguments . Our brothers of other worlds are charming and consoling myths , which we love to imagine in hours of despair , and they may either exist or not , according to our mood , being beyond the prosaic reach of observation . Nothing better has yet been found in favour of the plurality of worlds // than the reasoning by analogy , which was so prettily developed long ago by the good M. de Fontenelle . And when I am told that stupidity , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ought to be generally spread in the universe , let us acknowledge with him that , pending a more geometrical demonstration , we are almost convinced . It is amusing to remember that prize of 100,000 francs bequeathed to the Academy of Sciences by an excellent lady for the first person to communicate with a planet ? other than Mars . The donor thought that Mars would be too easy ! She had at least the wisdom not to require that the interest on this capital should accumulate . This is very fortunate , since in all probability this sum , placed at compound interest , would , before having been awarded , have absorbed the whole capital of the earth , thus provoking wars and the most terrible economic crises . Let anyone say after this that astronomical questions are of no practical importance ! Since the belief in the plurality of inhabited worlds is not yet either confirmed or refuted by science , I consider it proper and useful to support it . It offers a safeguard against anthropocentric views . We must admit that if nowhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if nowhere else there were any brains conceiving ideals , our little globe would be in truth , in spite of the mediocrity of its mass and // LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE its position , the capital of infinite space . And knowing this , men would perhaps become conceited , which would be inconceivable . As regards entering into relations with the hypothetical inhabitants of other planets , this is a problem which will not be solved so quickly . Problems more pressing than inter-planetary telegraphy face those who desire long-distance conversation . Let them try to communicate with the thoughts of our elder brothers , the animals , from which a deep gulf separates us ! Let them try to render accessible , one to the other , those dark and hermetic urns which are called two human souls ! And does not mineral matter present us with problems which are as accessible , and no less interesting , than those perishable and charming molecular edifices which we call human beings ? This is a question I shall not try to solve , since it has more faces than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis and the solar atmosphere ? The photosphere ? The sun-spots and their rhythm ? Temperature and radiation of the sun ? The spectro-heliograph ? The magnetic field of sunspots ? Action of the sun upon terrestrial magnets ? Electric radiations ? Radium and the agony of Helios . THE study of that small star which classic poets call the " day-star " has made giant strides of late . If we think that only about 2,000 years ago ? an atom of eternity ? some Athenian made a great scandal and was even accused of impiety for having dared to suggest that the sun was perhaps larger than the Peloponnesus ; when we remember that quite close to our time , only a century ago , Herschell believed the sun inhabited and that even yesterday or nearly so Arago considered it habitable ; if we compare this with our present knowledge , we can not but admire the triumphal march of science through this forest but recently cleared . All terrestrial life depends on the sun , but its importance is only due to its proximity . It is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very small as sidereal spaces go . This permits us to study it more exactly than other stars . In glancing through the doors recently // opened on the mystery by solar physicists , those modern priests of the sungod , we shall rather better estimate our ignorance concerning the vast universe , peopled by the millions of inaccessible suns of the Milky Way . Our sun is indeed one of the humblest and most modest of the stars . Aldebaran , the red eye of the Bull , one of the most beautiful stars of the evening in spring ( but not the most beautiful ) sends us an amount of light which is 90,000,000 times less than the light which we receive from the sun . Yet if the sun were placed at the distance of Aldebaran it would only be a star of the fifth magnitude , hardly visible to the naked eye and forty-five times less brilliant than Aldebaran . But there are others , Rigel , Canopus , and Deneb , which are immensely farther away than Aldebaran and still brighter than the latter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us not , however , despise it . Let us rather bless the providential chance which enables us to nestle under the warm wing of its vivifying rays . Without the sun we should not know there are yet brighter stars . Until we discover in some other stellar system ? it will not be to-morrow  --  other thinking beings , however badly they think , we shall retain the right to consider our small system as the capital of the universe and the sun as the lighthouse of the world . 68 THE SPECTROSCOPE Thus our ignorance remains the last defence of anthropocentric pride . The older methods of observation , the astronomical telescope and celestial mechanics , have enabled us to know the distance of the sun , its volume , 1,206,000 times that of the earth , its mean density less than a quarter that of our globe , and its mass 332,000 times that of the earth , and which produces on its surface a force of gravitation amounting to 27 times our own weight . On the other hand , it is only through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have gained a fairly accurate knowledge of the physical constitution of the sun . These methods have unravelled the physiology of this immense organism of which formerly we only knew the anatomy . We know that the light of the sun falling upon a fine slit and spread out in a fine spectroscope , shows itself as a continuous luminous band displaying the various colours of the rainbow , but interrupted by a multitude of fine black lines whose position remains sensibly constant . They correspond to the various chemical elements found in the atmosphere of the sun , close to the blinding disc from which we get the light , and which on that account is called the photosphere . Until a few years ago nobody had succeeded in producing an artificial spectrum corresponding to that of the sun except by placing incandescent gases // in front of a luminous solid or liquid source hotter than themselves , which was rendered incandescent by heat and also furnished a continuous spectrum . From this it had been concluded that the luminous clouds in constant motion which form the photosphere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observatory were composed of solid or liquid particles . But there is one curious circumstance : the temperature of the photosphere has been , as we shall see , found to be greatly superior to the boiling point of all the known chemical elements . How then could this photospheric matter not be in a state of vapour ? and if it was , how explain its continuous spectrum ? Vain efforts were made to get out of this contradiction . Recent researches offer an escape . They have shown that the bright spectrum rays of the gases which are fine and sharp at low pressures , widen out as the pressure increases until they join up and give a continuous spectrum . The modern tendency is therefore to think that the sun , including its photosphere , is entirely gaseous . We do not know much about what goes on under the photosphere . It hides from us the interior of the sun , just as the clouds hide from us the surface of Venus or Saturn . And why be surprised at our own ignorance if we know nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than // about a mile under our feet ? One thing is certain in any case : there must be on the sun enormous temperatures and pressures amounting to millions of atmospheres . What becomes of the gases compressed to that extent ? We can not imagine . It is the photosphere which sends us the greater part of the heat and light which we receive from the sun . Its rays are absorbed to some extent by the upper layer of the solar atmosphere and the consequence of this has been found to be that the edge of the sun appears less bright and also more reddish than the centre . Our atmosphere behaves in the same manner ; it absorbs the sun 's rays , but to an unequal extent , and more at the violet end of the spectrum than at the red end . This is why the setting sun seems to us less luminous and more reddish than the midday sun . Considered altogether , the photosphere sends us amounts of radiant energy the precise determination of which has long been one of the fundamental operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun sends as much light into space as 9,000 quadrillion candles . The miserable rushlight which we have just despised is therefore bright enough after all . In order to express the thermal energy of solar radiation including its luminous rays , astrophysicists // define a certain quantity which they call the " solar constant . " It is the quantity of heat received vertically from the sun for one minute by each square centimetre of the earth , adding that which is absorbed by the passage through our atmosphere . This quantity has been wrongly named , for what it measures is anything but constant ; but astronomers have no doubt plenty to do without purifying their language , and everybody knows what is meant . Now this solar constant , to call it by its ordinary name , is found , according to the most recent experiments , particularly that of the American Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution , to be very nearly two small calories . This means that the solar radiation would suffice to raise a uniform layer of water one centimetre thick , surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , by 2 ? in one minute , or from zero to 100 ? in 50 minutes . From this datum it has been proposed to deduce the temperature of the sun , or rather of the radiating layer of the photosphere . In order to do this it suffices to apply the law discovered by the physicist Stefan , which links the temperature of a source to the thermal energy it radiates . According to this law the energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature . This method has led to a figure a little above 5,000 ? . Numbers of the same order of magnitude have been reached by very different // methods and notably by studying the ratio of intensity of the different regions of the visible solar spectrum its globe are certainly at very different temperatures , the outer layers being colder than the inner ones , the above conclusion means this : the radiation which we receive from the sun is in quantity and quality nearly identical with that which would be sent to us by a star of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same distance and every part of which would have a temperature of about 5,000 ? and a power of emission equal to unity , as is the case , for instance , in lampblack . As we see , the idea of the temperature of the sun is much more complex than it is ordinarily supposed to be . We can not imagine it otherwise when we think how many different and variable data the meteorological notion of the mean temperature of the surface of the earth represents . Before the physical laws of radiation were known the most fantastic ideas were held concerning the temperature of the sun . Herschell and many others thought the sun was cold and dark , covered with mountains and valleys and with a luxuriant vegetation . It is true that he announced these astronomicobucolic theories in the eighteenth century when there was a fashion in favour of shepherds , a fashion which // even spread to royal courts . Why should these stars escape from that fashion , especially the star which had the particular honour of being a symbol of the greatest Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kirchhoff and Bunsen , had shown that the composition of the sun 's light was only compatible with a state of high incandescence , opinion ran to the other extreme . Father Secchi particularly , who has indeed contributed to astrophysics certain imperishable works , attributed to the sun a temperature of 10,000,000 ? . M. Violle , who was the first to put a little order into this uncertainty , defined the notion of effective temperature and showed that that of the sun could not surpass a few thousand degrees . He told me that in talking to Secchi on the question one day , he proposed to compromise and to adopt an intermediate number between their respective figures ; but Secchi would have none of this , and stuck to his millions of degrees with smiling pertinacity . The modern work of physicists on radiation , which alone could have convinced him , had not yet been born . The surface of the photosphere is not all homogeneous . It consists of granulations separated by darker patches in a state of extraordinary motion which displaces masses larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sea of incandescent clouds there are peaks and depressions. // The peaks are the so-called f aculce , which project from the surface of the photosphere like the pillar of light which guided the Israelites . They appear in the telescope or on photographs brighter than the general average of the photosphere , probably because their height enables their light to reach us with less absorption from the solar atmosphere . The depressions or holes seen in the photosphere are the sun-spots . When , after the invention of the telescope about 1610 , Fabricius , Scheirer and Galileo in turn discovered them , there was great astonishment . It was the last blow given to the old mystical astronomy of the Middle Ages which , with its complicated system of spheres of celestial crystal , had conceived the stars to be spotless and in some way immaterial . In general the sun-spots have an aspect of a central nucleus very dark in comparison with the rest of the disc and surrounded by a lighter penumbra . One is reminded of a funnel thrown into the photosphere and terminating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1/20th of the diameter of the sun , that is to say , about five times the diameter of the earth . While observing them one sees that they are slowly moving . Thus it was discovered for the first time that the sun is not immovable but rotates about an axis slightly inclined to the ecliptic and in the same direction as the rotation of the earth and the revolu- // tion of the planets about the sun . In this manner and with the aid of observations on the faculae some curious laws , governing the rotation of the sun , were discovered . That rotation does not take place en bloc like that of a rigid and coherent body , but it takes about 25 days at the equator and a little more in other parts . At a distance mid-way between the poles and the equator the photosphere takes 271 days to complete a rotation . This is very strange . We might have expected to see the equator turning more slowly than the rest , since , for the same angular velocity , its linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion of the innumerable theories put forward to explain these facts . They are almost too complicated not to touch the truth in some point and too ingenious to be perfect . Besides , it is only the facts which matter . It is particularly spectrum analysis , that unexpected auxiliary of the astronomy of position , which has furnished us with accurate and interesting revelations on the movements of the sun . This was rendered possible by the application of the Doppler-Fizeau principle , or the principle of radial velocities . This enormously fertile method has thrown unexpected floods of light into nearly every domain of astronomy . Let us briefly recall of what it consists . We have all noticed when the whistling engine of // an express flies through a railway station at top speed the sound of the whistle , which seemed very high while the express was approaching , suddenly falls as the engine passes through the station and recedes in the distance . It would have had an intermediate pitch if the train , while continuing to whistle , had stopped in the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound depends upon the length of the waves emitted by the whistle . Now this wave-length is diminished by the speed of the locomotive when it approaches . It is increased , on the other hand , when it recedes . In fact the engine , while approaching us , pursues in some way the sound waves , compresses them and presses them towards us . When , on the other hand , the locomotive passes from us in a direction opposed to the waves emitted towards us it tends to extend and to lengthen them . The sound is therefore made sharper in the first case and flatter in the second . The same thing applies to light-waves . The lines of a chemical element are displaced towards one end of the spectrum or the other by a small quantity which indicates the speed of the source towards us or away from us ? that is to say , its radial velocity . If the source moves away from us the wave-length of the lines of the spectrum is increased and the lines are displaced towards the red end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end in the opposite case , and these displacements are easily measured . In the case of the solar rotation , it is even much simpler . It is sufficient to receive on the slit of the same spectroscope the images of the two opposite edges of the sun situated at the extremities of the equator or of a parallel of latitude whose speed of rotation we wish to measure . Each line appears double because one of the edges is approaching us while the other is receding . The amount of this doubling enables us to know the difference in the linear velocities of the two edges whence we may easily deduce the speed of rotation . Yet there are certain lines of the spectrum which do not appear double . They are the lines due to the absorption of the solar rays by our atmosphere and particularly by oxygen . Janssen has called them " telluric lines , " and that is indeed a method of discovering them . By this procedure astronomers have confirmed and extended as far as the pole the law of decrease of the solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to know for certain latitudes which they frequented . While the sidereal rotation takes place in a little less than 25 days at the equator , it takes 26.3 days at the latitude of 30 ? ; 31 days at 62 ? and 35.3 days at latitude of 80 ? . These enormous divergences are surprising . They are , however , // constantly in evidence whatever may be the lines of the spectrum which we examine . We sometimes find systematic differences , the rays of one chemical element giving greater linear velocity on the same parallel than those of another . This is due to the fact that the first element is found in a layer of the atmosphere which is higher above the photosphere than the other element . This gives a convenient means of finding the altitude of the strata which contain the various chemical elements . In particular and quite recently it has been found by this method that there are enormous masses of gaseous calcium high above those strata which furnish the solar hydrogen lines and that in spite of the much greater lightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature than the photosphere . This is evident from the researches made by Lockyer and more recently by Hale , Adams , and King , who compared the spectra of elements vapourised in the arc and the electric furnace with those of the photosphere and the sun-spots . This also follows from the fact that they show in the spectroscope spectrum bands which are not seen in the photosphere . These are due , as has been found lately , to the presence in the spots of various metallic oxides and hydrides , particularly those of titanium , magnesium , and calcium . It is well known that at a high temperature the chemical compounds tend to // dissociate and that they can not exist at the temperature of the electric arc . The abundance of these bands in the spectrum of the sun-spots enables us to assign to the latter a temperature of about 3,500 ? . In the history of sun-spots the best established fact is their curious periodicity . About every 11 years ? on an average 11.1 years ? they are nearly absent from the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and their total extent increase gradually to a maximum ; they then remain practically stationary for some time , afterwards diminishing for about six or seven years until they disappear and recommence . The last maximum of sun-spots was in 1917 and the preceding minimum was in 1913 . Untold efforts have been made to find the cause of this strange phenomenon , which , like the gigantic respiration of some internal monster , periodically tears up the surface of the sun , subsequently allowing it to recover only to repeat the same process . Some astronomers have blamed the combined attraction of the larger planets on the solar nucleus and many other things . None of these attempts have been successful . We are indeed in the most complete ignorance of the causes which make our sun not a fixed star but a variable star , corresponding to so many others which the photometer reveals in the depths of the heavens . This is all the more regrettable since all the other solar phenomena recently discovered in // its atmosphere , particularly its curious magnetism , are , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solar activity . It results at least from the discoveries of which I shall have to say more presently , that if there is nothing new under the sun , there are at least many new things on the sun itself . The fable of the blind man and the lame man gives a good representation of the parts played in science by theory and experiment respectively . Neither can do without the other any more than the two crippled heroes of Florian . Experiment , if not blind , is at least very near-sighted and knows only that which it can touch with the finger . Its range does not exceed the length of its nose , and it would be marking time on the same spot without the help of theory , of the clear eye which sees obstacles from afar and also the mirage on the horizon . But theory in its turn would be nothing if it were not hoisted on the strong shoulders of experiment . Without experiment it would never be able to distinguish reality from illusion in the appearances seen from a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality , condemned always to pass its eyes round the immovable circle of the same deceptive panorama , it would remain rooted to the same spot and degenerate into nonsense . THE SUN AND ITS INFLUENCES It is thus that a collaboration , stormy sometimes , of experiment which touches and theory which predicts , of realities and systems , fact and hypothesis , have hobbled along to construct the edifice of contemporary science which is still incomplete , but never probably has this collaboration of the brain which guides and the hand which feels been so complete and fruitful as when it found in the sun 's atmosphere all those astonishing things which have been discovered there during the last few years . The existence of a vast absorbing atmosphere round the sun was probable a priori by every astronomical analogy . It is experimentally demonstrated by the diminution of the brightness of the sun 's disc from the centre to the edge and by the black spectrum lines discovered by Fraunhofer . The latter show that there is round the photosphere a layer of relatively cool gases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality it is the total eclipses of the sun which first made us aware of this atmosphere . At ordinary times it is quite invisible to us for the same reasons as those which prevent us seeing the stars in the daytime ; the brightness of the sun 's disc itself and the light diffused by our blue sky . Daylight has therefore long been an obstacle to our astronomical progress , a curtain interposed between the stars and ourselves . The eclipses of the sun which at rare intervals tear // aside this curtain have shown round the disc covered by the black curve of the moon an immense luminous glory with shafts of light extending millions of miles . It has several divisions ; first there is close to the sun a thin ring of a bright pink or ruby colour which is called the chromosphere , from which slender tentacles arise , also of a pink colour , called protuberances . These are sometimes several hundred thousand miles long . We see there in a state of agitation and constant change even during the short duration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite fantastic , surpassing as it often does 60,000 miles a second . Around the chromosphere and its red protuberances there extends the coronal atmosphere , the enormous greenish crown which constitutes the external atmosphere of the sun . The study of these various layers by spectrum analysis carried on for half a century during eclipses has proved that the chromosphere and the protuberances are chiefly composed of incandescent hydrogen , and that the green light of the corona is due to a gas which has not yet been identified with any of those known on the earth . It has been called coronium . The spectroscope , that unrivalled instrument of marvellous knowledge , furnished at every new eclipse such a rich harvest of discoveries , while the expeditions organised for every eclipse were so costly and uncertain , since a single cloud could render them // useless , that it appeared desirable to discover methods of showing without eclipses what these capricious and fugitive phenomena had revealed . Between 1868 and 1906 , in 38 years , the number of total eclipses of the sun was 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An astronomer who had organised expeditions to every part of the earth where they were visible would therefore not have seen the solar atmosphere for more than an hour and a half in all . That is very little . The first step to remedy this situation was taken by Janssen and Lockyer in discovering their celebrated method , now universally employed , to see the protuberances in full daylight . Since then , so far as the chromosphere and its protuberances are concerned , the observation of total eclipses has been almost superfluous . On the other hand , every effort made hitherto to observe the corona apart from eclipses has failed completely . Hence our ignorance concerning the exact nature of this " glory " which sometimes surrounds the superposed faces of the sun and moon . Yet it has been proved that the corona is composed of extremely rarefied gases which hold very fine dust in suspension , and that it is so light that in spite of its enormous thickness it is transparent to the light of the stars . If the observation of the corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out a wonderful work in giving us in the spectro-heliograph a means of continually observing phenomena which the eclipses themselves did not show , hidden as they were behind the opaque disc of the moon . I speak of the various layers of the solar atmosphere , not only at the edge of the sun 's disc but over its whole surface . The spectro-heliograph is the common and independent work of two astronomers , one of them a Frenchman , Deslandres , and the other an American , Hale . In spite of its somewhat uncouth name the instrument is , like all really beautiful inventions , founded upon an idea which is both simple and ingenious . I can not resist the desire to point out briefly in what it consists , at the risk of appearing for some moments rather too technical . We can hardly take a true and complete pleasure in the harmonious structures of science if we have no idea of the mechanisms which have laid the heavy foundation-stones . If science teaches us the how and not the why of things it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered . Let us imagine having a fairly large image of the sun at the focus of a telescope and placing the slit of a powerful spectroscope along a diameter of that image , say along the equator . Then we can have at the end of the instrument a complete spectrum of // the solar equator . Let us suppose that we pick out from this spectrum a particular line such as the pink line of hydrogen and then all the rest of the spectrum is hidden by a screen with a fine slit which coincides with that line . Now if we place a photographic plate behind that screen we shall have on that plate a line traversing the equator of the sun , a line whose thickness and intensity will not be the same from one end to the other . They depend in fact upon the distribution along the equator of the masses of hydrogen which give rise to that line . Let us now imagine that while all the rest is immovable , the image of the sun is displaced so that it is traversed entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the apparatus a simultaneous corresponding movement is given to the photographic plate it is clear that we shall receive on that plate a representation of the sun due entirely to its atmospheric hydrogen . Thus , by isolating one or other of the lines of the spectrum we can obtain an image of the solar atmosphere due exclusively to a particular element contained in that atmosphere or rather to a particular line of that element . And there is much more . Thanks to the spectroheliograph we have succeeded in finding the distribution in height of a given chemical element , its distribution in various layers of the solar atmosphere // projected upon the disc . That is a wonderful result . Here also the physics of the sun is ahead of that of our globe , since we have no means of determining by a simple optical operation the composition of the various layers of our atmosphere in a vertical line . It has now been proved that most of the 20,000 black lines found in the solar spectrum are entirely due to the absorption of a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ideas of Kirchhoff it is this absorption which has the effect of inverting the bright lines emitted by that gaseous layer itself and converting them into black lines . The existence of this reversing layer has been recently confirmed by photographing the spectrum during eclipses . Just in contact with the photosphere this spectrum shows for a brief moment ? hence the name " flash spectrum " ? in the form of bright lines all those which are black in the ordinary solar spectrum . This is a brilliant expansion of the idea of Kirchhoff . Generally speaking , the heaviest chemical elements are only found in the lower layer of the solar atmosphere . Yet there are remarkable exceptions , and I have already said that clouds of calcium vapour are found far above the altitudes where hydrogen is abundant . The speeds of these gaseous masses are sometimes 1 excessively high . The cloud of hydrogen vapour // has recently been observed to be attracted or aspirated suddenly in the direction of a sun-spot with a speed of 240,000 miles per hour ( the distance between earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characteristic curvature of the protuberances , have long convinced theoretical astronomers that the sun is the seat of powerful magnetic and electric phenomena . The very existence of the light of the solar atmosphere proves it , for we know that gases can never be rendered luminous by heat alone and without electrical excitation . These conclusions were as yet unconfirmed by experiment , but that confirmation has been furnished by a magnificent discovery directly resulting from researches with the spectroheliograph and which we must now proceed to explain . Some time ago Mr. Hale noticed that on some of the spectro-heliograms obtained with hydrogen lines gas showed itself over the sun-spots in the shape of tracts irregularly curved towards them , with the appearance of having been influenced by a violent cyclonic movement having its centre in the spot itself . A closer study shows that this movement of incandescent hydrogen is real . We can indeed sometimes perceive masses of gas violently sucked in towards the centre of the spot . That observation was very interesting in itself since it showed a similarity between the solar atmosphere above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own atmosphere . There is nothing surprising in this . But it is from this simple fact of observation that Mr. Hale , by a close chain of combined reasoning and experiment , has arrived at one of the most beautiful and suggestive discoveries of modern astronomy : that of the magnetism of sun-spots and the magnetic field of the whole sun . And this is how it came about . If , says Mr. Hale , there is a whirlpool of matter in a sun-spot , and if it is electrified , it must produce an electric current as well as a magnetic field . Now matter is most probably electrified on the outskirts of the photosphere . Indeed , as we have shown , the luminosity of the gases of the coronal sphere is certainly of electrical origin . On the other hand , our terrestrial atmosphere is electrified , and we know that the movement which produces storms also produces those intense electric discharges which we call lightning . These same phenomena , but in a higher degree , must exist on the sun . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our atmosphere ionises them ? that is , dissociates them into smaller charged particles , some of them charged with negative electricity and others with positive . A fortiori , that light could not act otherwise in the sun 's atmosphere , where it is millions of times more intense . In fact , we have discovered during the last few years that incandescent bodies // emit large quantities of negative electrons . The filament of an electric bulb may in this manner produce a current of several amperes per square centimetre of its surface . The solar photosphere , which is in a much higher state of incandescence , must behave similarly . We can therefore not escape from the conclusion that matter in movement in the solar atmosphere must be strongly charged with electricity . If that is so , then this electrified matter in motion must produce the same effects as an electric current circulating in a wire . The American physicist , Rowland , showed at one time , in a celebrated experiment , that a body charged with statical electricity and moving very rapidly corresponds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the latter , the property of deflecting magnets in its vicinity , and we know from the classical experiments of Oersted and Ampere that the sense of this deflection is governed by a simple rule and takes place in such a manner that the magnet tends to place itself across the electric current . In other words , electrified bodies in movement produce a magnetic field in their neighbourhood . It follows that the electrified gases whirling above the sun-spots must act like the giant coil of an electro-magnet and must produce a magnetic field whose axis is sensibly perpendicular to the sun . // All this is well and good , but it yet remained to prove it , and this is what Mr. Hale did , by utilising the Zeeman phenomenon by very ingenious means , which it must be confessed were only made available by the unique organisation and the considerable budgets of American astronomy . The Zeeman phenomenon , named after the Dutch physicist who discovered it on the admirably prophetic suggestion of Lorentz , is an effect produced by magnets and more generally by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is caused by the very rapid displacements of those minute planets charged with electricity which are called electrons , and which form that miniature solar system which we know as the atom . A spectrum line of a given gas corresponds to a particular frequency of vibration of the ether , and that is produced by the speed of the electrons revolving round the centre of the atom . Let us consider , for example , those electrons which in hydrogen produce a given spectrum line . If we let a powerful magnet act upon that gas we can divide those electrons into three classes : those which at the time of the experiment are moving in such a way that their movement is opposed by the magnet , those whose movement is accelerated by the magnet , and lastly those of intermediate orientation upon whose speed the magnet has no influence . It is clear that instead // of a single line , these electrons will give three spectrum lines , the central one of which will coincide with the single original line . Further , theory shows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite directions . The phenomenon discovered by Zeeman has shown that , in accordance with the elementary explanation just given , and which is still rather incomplete , such effects are actually produced . Mr. Hale therefore undertook to find whether the solar spectrum in the neighbourhood of the sun-spots showed the Zeeman effect . For this purpose he investigated certain spectrum lines on the sun-spots which had already been found quite unaccountably broadened or even doubled in comparison with the normal spectrum lines . Success crowned his long series of ingenious efforts . Having thus revealed the existence of the Zeeman phenomenon in the sunspots , Mr. Hale concluded that these constituted strong magnetic fields whose intensity sometimes reaches 3,000 units ? that is to say , more than 6,000 times the magnetic force which , on the earth 's surface , directs the magnetic needle northwards . Mr. Hale also proved that the magnetic polarity of the spots depends upon the sense in which they revolve , and that often two spots placed symmetrically north and south of the solar equator have opposite magnetisms . He finally showed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun-spots , the // whole sun is a magnet like the earth itself . The north and south magnetic poles point in the same direction as on our globe , and are but slightly removed from the poles of rotation . The magnetic axis of the sun is inclined about 6 ? to its axis of rotation . Finally , a subsequent discovery by the German physicist Stark has brought to these studies of solar physics a new element of interest and hope . It has revealed the fact that these spectrum lines can not only show the existence of magnetic fields , but also , by an effect corresponding to the Zeeman effect , though different in its action , the existence of electric fields which act upon the sources of light . It is too early as yet to gauge the consequences in astrophysics due to Stark 's phenomenon . Certain astronomers regard the new complication which it is about to introduce in the study of solar optics with some anxiety . They are afraid of soon being unable to find their way among the multiple elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , and it is like complaining that the bride is too beautiful . The greater the progress of science , the more complicated will be the fugitive appearances she shows to us . If this had only the advantage of making us more modest in our pretensions and less self-satisfied in our systems , that would all be to the good . But there are many other attractions , if only the attraction of that which is novel and unheard-of . // In any case , henceforward there will be a rich harvest of discoveries in connection with the atmosphere of our little sun , and it is not in vain that astronomers have gradually lifted the misty veil behind which its disc of liquid gold floats . Sometimes , and especially in certain years , vast displays of aurora borealis appear nearly all over our hemisphere and extend even to the low latitudes where one is unaccustomed to see those golden draperies floating in the heavens . During those times sun-spots are always seen , and navigators find that their magnetic compasses are disturbed by an unusual agitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traversed by abnormal electric currents , by those " telluric " currents which violently disturb the transmission of messages in the telegraphic cables . What relation is there between the sun-spot which at a distance of 93,000,000 miles from the earth tears up the sun 's shining photosphere and those inconveniences which are encountered by the most matterof-fact of our administrators in the transmission of his telegrams ? What telepathy unites those very distant things with the magnetic needle which on the bridges of our liners marks out the ocean paths ? That is what we must discuss now . In a given place the magnetic needle when freely suspended takes approximately a north and south direction . I say approximately because generally // it is deflected slightly towards the east or west by an angle which is called declination . It also points its nose towards the ground , at least in our hemisphere , and makes an angle with the horizon which is called the dip , or inclination . These two angles , together with the variable force which keeps the needle in the magnetic meridian , constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . These elements vary considerably from one place to another , and in the same place from one year to another . Thus , at Paris , towards the year 1580 , the declination was towards the east and amounted to 9 ? . From this date onwards the needle turned constantly from year to year a little more towards the west until about 1800 . It was then 22 ? of western declination . Since then it has slowly returned to the east and at the present time it is only about 13 ? west of the geographical meridian . At the present moment it is about 16 ? in Brittany and 10 ? among the Maritime Alps . This shows that it changes not onlyin time but also in space . Besides their secular variation , which is far from being explained , the magnetic elements in every place undergo much more rapid fluctuations , so-called short-period variations which are of great interest on account of the strange glimpses which they give us into cosmic physics . They will bring us to the very heart of our subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to reassure with a word those persons who by a scruple which may not be very exalted and yet is worthy of respect ? scruples are always worthy of respect ? ask in connection with every new thing what is the use of it . The direction of the magnetic needle is of capital importance for navigation . It is thanks to the magnetic compass that Christopher Columbus was able to launch himself on the limitless ocean . It is true that in his time the magnetic elements were imperfectly known . Columbus was much surprised when he noticed , on September 13 , 1492 , that the needle of his compass , instead of pointing to the Pole-star , deviated from it to the left by 6 ? . On the following day it was found , after going further west , that the deviation had increased . To his frightened sailors , who thought that the natural laws were upset , and that the magnetic compass was about to lose its mysterious power , Columbus had to impart a flood of reassuring words . He succeeded in calming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct ? that the needle turned round the pole like the stars of the firmament . To-day the mariners and explorers can not do without compasses and magnetic charts . Even surveyors and practical geometers find them as indispensable as household utensils . Aerial naviga- // tion finds in them a valuable help in its audacious enterprises . Now all this is useful for some things , and indeed for many things . It gives us what Baudclaire with a somewhat bitter contempt calls " ustensiles . " I may even add , paying a rare tribute to utilitarians , that on the other hand navigators have enriched our store of scientific data , still too sparsely distributed , on terrestrial magnetism . Therefore , even in the eyes of those people of whom Henri Poincare spoke with a smiling disdain , " whose object in life is to make money , " terrestrial magnetism is of great importance . Our knowledge concerning it has a perceptible influence upon the dividends of any concern depending on navigation ? that is to say , the majority of human enterprises . ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilitarianism we can with a light heart return to those mysterious regions where magnetic phenomena are nothing more than alluring problems . There we find a pure joy apart from the prose of life which brings us gradually over a thousand enchantments to those summits of pure beauty which our efforts will always approach but never reach : the why and how of nature . In observing with delicate instruments the magnetic needle , we find that at a given place and in normal // THE SUN AND ITS INFLUENCES times it undergoes a slight daily displacement . Every day between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. the needle moves slowly towards the east , subsequently returning to the west and resuming its first direction , after a slight deviation during the night . It recommences the next morning . The amplitude of this diurnal deviation is feeble . The angle between the two extreme positions is only a few minutes of arc , a small fraction of a degree . But the curious thing is that the important part of the variation is produced at every place during the hours when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner that the needle seems to follow the direction of the sun . This shows clearly that the intensity of solar radiation counts a great deal in this daily variation of the compass-needle . Moreover , this variation is much greater in summer than in winter . This implies that in the southern hemisphere it is feebler in July than in December . At Nice , for instance , the declination of the needle oscillates by fifteen minutes of arc in June and only five minutes in December . The epochs are reversed in the case of a southern station . The other two magnetic elements show analogous variations . On the other hand ? and this completes our demonstration ? the amplitude of the daily variation , reckoned by the force which it represents in each locality , is greatest in the equatorial regions of the earth , just // where the solar radiation is strongest . It diminishes as it approaches the poles , where sunlight also diminishes . Even more cogent facts , if that is possible , have come to establish definitely that the daily variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have known for 150 years that the sun-spots have a regular periodicity of about 11 years . It is a sort of monstrous respiration with a slow rhythm which periodically opens and closes the radiant surface of the disc . Now the daily variation of the magnetic elements shows a cycle which is absolutely parallel to that of the sun-spots . In every part of the earth the declination , like all the other magnetic elements , shows daily variations which are the greater the larger the number of sun-spots . In the years of maximum of the latter , the amplitude of the daily variations is about 12 times what it is during the years of minimum sun-spots . The phenomena as they go on year by year show exactly parallel fluctuations which allow of no doubt that they are cause and effect . All these facts show that a mysterious sympathy links those perturbations which agitate the sun 's surface 93,000,000 miles away with the shivers of our little compasses in their glass cages . I now come to a phenomenon of a different charac- // ter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activity of the sun and the magnetism of the earth . I refer to the magnetic storms . The variations we have referred to are slow , regular , continuous variations of the elements of terrestrial magnetism . Besides these regular oscillations , which can be predicted for long times ahead , there are other oscillations , sudden and unforeseen , which in spite of their violence escape all regularity and occur by a sort of accident . It is almost as if in the ocean , besides the tides which impart a periodic rhythmic movement to the liquid surface , there arose storms and sudden tempests . In such a way there occur , beside the real daily . oscillations of the magnetic needle , real magnetic tempests which make the compass needle " crazy , " as the mariners say . At certain times the mariner 's compass is disturbed by sudden spasmodic movements . Their amplitude is often largely in excess of the total amplitude of the daily variation . It corresponds to the force which sometimes amounts to a hundredth part of the total magnetic field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what happened ? to take only one example ? in the night from the 22nd to the 23rd of March , 1920 , when the needles of the magnetometers in the 100 i MAGNETIC STORMS observatories underwent an intense agitation which suddenly deflected , at Kew , for example , the needle by more than 3 ? , or 10 times its normal daily variation . At the same time a magnificent aurora borealis was observed in the whole northern hemisphere and down to very low latitudes . Also intense telluric currents interrupted telegraphic communication . At the same time astronomers found on the central meridian of the sun a large group of spots , one of which was 50 times the surface of the whole earth . The synchronism of these diverse phenomena is not a chance coincidence . For many years in fact a large number of observatories have registered the number and importance of magnetic storms . The statistics based on these observations establish a striking parallelism between these phenomena and the sun-spot cycle . The magnetic perturbations have a mean periodicity of 11 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail the curve representing the sun 's activity . Lastly , and that is not the least singular fact , the number of displays of aurora borealis observed in every latitude where they are visible undergoes a cycle identical and parallel with that of the sun-spots . There is one remarkable characteristic of the great magnetic perturbations which commence suddenly , like that of March 22nd , 1920 . They are produced simultaneously in the most distant stations on the // surface of the earth , starting at the same instant . This proves that they are due to a cosmic cause . What is the exact nature and mechanism of this mysterious connection which links the activity of the solar surface with our magnetic storms ? The detailed study of sun-spots and the corresponding perturbations of the compass must enlighten us . The question has been asked whether there is a relation between the appearances of magnetic storms and the position of spots on the sun 's disc . Opinions have been violently contradictory . Certain astronomers like Marchand , the much-regretted Director of the Pic-du-Midi Observatory , maintained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central meridian of the sun . The American astronomer Veeder finds a coincidence at the moment when the sun-spots appear on the edge of the sun . Remember that the sun-spots revolve with the sun 's rotation , which takes place in about 27 days . Tacchini , the Italian astronomer , and Hale , the American astrophysicist , to whom we owe the discovery of the magnetic field of sun-spots , have clearly shown that the relation linking solar disturbances with those of our magnets hardly depends upon the position of the disturbed region on the solar disc . I hope I may be excused from giving minute details . Father Sidgreaves , of Stonyhurst Observa- // tory , clearly confirms this . For example , the group of sun-spots which coincided with the great storm of 1920 had an area such that it took four days to traverse the sun 's meridian . It is difficult to know which region of this group was most effective magnetically , and magnetic storms have often obviously coincided with spots very far from the central meridian . There is therefore no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their heliocentric longitude , to put it correctly though pedantically . Every observer has noticed that the agitation of our compass-needles does not depend so much upon the size of the spots as upon their activity . Some spots are quiet and nearly immobile on the sun . Others are violently agitated , and change their shape at every instant , the spectroscope showing great displacements of material . A small but highly agitated sun-spot is more active in this respect than a quiet spot of immense extent . This agitation of sun-spots is best seen by the spectroscope , which shows the characteristic rays of the gases greatly distorted . This indicates rapid movements in various directions , according to the principle of DopplerFizeau . At this point in our discussion we must put a fundamental question . Is it really possible that cyclones produced on the sun 93,000,000 miles away // disturb our compasses , while terrestrial cyclones do not ? How can that be ? Since the link between the sun 's activity and our terrestrial magnetism has been incontestably established it has excited general interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation been sought . It is perhaps just on account of this unsolved riddle that so many spirits in the scientific world and outside are concerned with it . Some time ago the astronomer Young , whose work on the sun has advanced our knowledge considerably , wrote as follows : " It is difficult to imagine a satisfactory theory to explain the effect of solar disturbances upon our terrestrial magnetism . . . this magnetic relation proves that forces other than gravitation act across interplanetary space . " So long as the sun was considered incapable , apart from gravitation , of acting upon neighbouring heavenly bodies , except by the radiation of heat and light , the question could not be advanced . These effects can not be explained by the action of temperature alone . An attempt was then made to compare the sun with a gigantic magnet acting upon the earth as upon another magnet . But it is easily calculated that the solar globe would have to possess an intensity of magnetisation 10,000 times greater than that of our own globe to produce a variation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the less likely since matter loses its magnetic properties at high temperatures . This hypothesis has been definitely disposed of by Lord Kelvin . The illustrious English physicist made a famous calculation in this connection . Considering a given magnetic storm of average amount he calculated that the variation of the intensity of the different magnetic elements during this perturbation , which lasted several hours , represented about 364 times the total energy of solar radiation . And he concluded his calculation as follows " During the eight hours of this magnetic storm , which was a relatively moderate one , the sun would have had to produce , in the form of magnetic waves , as much energy as it regularly throws into space in four months , in the shape of heat and light radiation . This result seems to me completely to exclude the hypothesis that terrestrial magnetic storms are due to a direct magnetic action of the sun , or to any direct dynamic action of that body . " And Lord Kelvin concluded with some melancholy : " Up to now all efforts made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to show how this difficult step has been taken , how recent conquests of science have furnished the explanation of this magnetic telepathy by which the pulsations of the sun produce // palpitations of the sensitive steel of our magnetic compasses . According to the above calculation of Lord Kelvin , the energy which reaches us from the sun , and which , if the sun were a magnet , would be necessary to explain these magnetic storms , is so enormous that it renders that explanation unlikely . But truth may indeed be improbable , much more in astronomy even than in literature . It remained to prove that the explanation rejected theoretically by Lord Kelvin was proved false by the facts . It was also necessary to substitute other hypotheses which would themselves be plausible . And that , as we shall see , is what has recently been done . As regards the first point , the answer has been given by the work of Hale and his collaborators on the subject of solar magnetism . Taking the values of the magnetic fields observed by Hale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were all of the same polarity the magnetic effect on our earth could not be detected by our instruments . And besides , they turn , like our terrestrial cyclones , in opposite senses in each hemisphere , and this produces opposing magnetic fields whose effects are neutralised at a certain distance from the sun . Our negative conclusion is thus corroborated . As regards the total magnetic field of the sun discovered by Hale , it does not in any case exceed 50 // units , which is a hundred times the field of the earth . It is easy to show by calculation that the sun 's action on earthly magnets can not be due to this any more than to the sun-spots . Thus Lord Kelvin 's conclusions are clearly based not . only upon probabilities , but upon realities . The explanation of the sympathy which draws our compass-needles after the sun must therefore be sought elsewhere . It has been found in recent discoveries on electric radiations . If the energy which causes the movements of the magnetic needle , its intense perturbations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , there is one means , and only one means , of escaping from the difficulties thus presented to us . It is by admitting that this energy is really upon the earth , and that the sun but liberates it . Thus the detonator of the shell liberates the enormous energy contained in the explosive . Thus also , to give a more suitable comparison , in ordinary or wireless telegraphy a very feeble electric current can bring into action an enormous force quite out of proportion to the feeble intensity of the waves through the intermediary of a relay . Gauss wrote long ago : " If we eliminate unfounded fantasies we can only explain magnetic variations by electric currents circulating in the atmosphere . " The atmosphere , " Gauss admitted , " does not // conduct such currents any more than a vacuum . We are thus presented with a riddle . " The air at atmospheric pressure is indeed a bad conductor of electric currents . But this is not always the case with rarefied air ? that is to say , air at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only revealed by later physical research . Can there really be electric currents in the upper atmosphere ? It is not sufficient that there is electric conductivity ( and we shall see that such conductivity exists in the upper atmosphere ) . The mere existence of a copper cable does not bring about an electric current . It is also necessary that there should be between the ends of the cable a difference of potential , an electro-motive force like that produced by the Volta pile or the dynamo . May there , or must there be in the atmosphere , causes which constantly produce electro-motive force ? Yes , and these causes lie in the movements of that atmosphere , in the circulation of air created by them . These movements are produced partly by the rotation of the earth and partly by inequalities of temperature . Winds , and particularly the great regular winds , trade winds , and counter trade winds , are the effects of this circulation . There is in electricity a well-known and extremely important fact ? upon which indeed the theory and construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electricity is displaced in the magnetic field the latter creates electro-magnetic forces which produce electric currents in the conductor . In the dynamo , coils of copper wire revolve in the magnetic field of an electro-magnet .. It is this displacement which produces'the electromotive force and the electric current . Similarly , the circulation of the higher atmosphere gives rise to electric currents , since it displaces air in the magnetic field of the earth . It is true that that magnetic field is feeble . But on the other hand , the electric conductor , constituted by the upper atmosphere is thousands of miles long and tens or hundreds of miles in width . Even if the electro-motive force produced is feeble , the resulting electric currents can be of extraordinary intensity provided the air is sufficiently conducting . The air at the level of the ground has a very feeble conductivity , as is proved by the fact that if an object charged with electricity is placed even upon a perfectly insulating support it gradually loses that charge in the surrounding air . Recent researches have cleared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by radium rays which emerge everywhere from the earth 's crust , and which " ionise " the air ? that is to say , dissociate some of its atoms . Now " ionised " air becomes a conductor of electricity , // to an extent depending upon the strength of the ionising radiation . Thus , X-rays and radium rays enable gases to conduct electricity and to deprive a charged body of its charge when traversing the gas surrounding that body . Knowing the extremely feeble value of the conductivity of the air near the ground , it is easy to calculate the conductivity of the upper strata of the atmosphere , supposing they were " ionised " by the same causes . Thus it is found that that conductivity , given the probable speed of displacement of the higher atmosphere , is still 100,000 times too feeble to give rise to electric currents capable of explaining the variations of our compass-needles . It follows that in its upper strata our atmosphere must be " ionised " much more strongly than near the ground . Astrophysicists tell us that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasoning and fact is closed rigorously ? the sun must emit strongly " ionising " rays which explain at the same time the electric currents circulating in the higher atmosphere , and why the currents influencing our compasses are in such close dependence upon solar activity . To sum up : If the sun emits radiations capable of strongly " ionising " the upper strata of the atmosphere , these radiations and their fluctuations will suffice to explain , as we shall see , the regular or sudden changes of the magnetic elements . In this case the // sun only switches on the currents of the higher atmosphere by producing the necessary conductivity . It behaves like the very feeble waves of wireless telegraphy which switch on , by means of the coherer , the energy of the telegraphic relay at the receiving station . In the case of the electric currents of the higher atmosphere , the energy utilised is that of the air movements loosed by the rotation of the earth , and it is entirely derived from those . If we go over the famous calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year produced a hundred perturbations of an intensity and violence equal to the largest ever observed , the corresponding energy derived from the rotation of the earth would , even after a million years , not suffice to retard that rotation by a single second per year . Thus , in this new conception all previous difficulties disappear . Now what can and must be the radiations emanating from the sun which ionise the upper atmosphere of the earth with a variable intensity and thus explain the connection between that heavenly body and our magnetic needles ? The first place among those radiations must be given to the ultra-violet rays of the sun . It has not yet indeed been proved that these rays can directly " ionise " the air , but we know that they can act on small dust particles . Therefore if the upper atmo- // sphere contains dust ? which is not impossible ? and if it carries the minute icicles of cirrhus clouds , the ultra-violet rays of the sun must more or less " ionise " the higher atmospheric layers . T explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays of the sun are much more intense when the sun is covered with spots , and also that they emanate from those spots . All this is possible , but not yet proved . And then there is another phenomenon which we shall discuss further on , and which though closely connected with magnetic perturbations can not be explained by the ultra-violet rays of the sun ; this is the aurora borealis . All these reasons lead us to suppose that the ultraviolet radiation of the sun can not furnish a complete explanation of the observed phenomena . We must look for other causes . A theory which has had many adherents , and has many still , is the ingenious and attractive assumption that the sun emits cathode rays . This theory has been developed in its various aspects by Goldstein , Paulsen , Birkeland , Stormer , and also with great brilliance by Deslandres . We know that cathode rays consist of negatively charged corpuscles or electrons projected with considerable speeds in Crookes tubes . If a difference of potential is produced in a sufficiently rarefied gas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through // the electric field . It is extremely probable that there is an electric field in the lower strata of the solar atmosphere . But in order that the sun should emit cathode rays it is necessary that the electrification of its atmosphere be the same as that of ours . We know that the surface of the earth is negatively electric with respect to the air , and this condition is favourable to an emission of electrons from the earth . Now several authors have arrived at the conclusion that the electrification of the sun must be opposed to that of the earth , and this makes it more difficult to conceive the emission of solar cathode rays . Another objection which has not yet been answered quite satisfactorily is that if the sun flooded space continually with negative electrons it would finally acquire a positive charge sufficient to stop all further cathode ray emission , since opposite electricities attract one another . Another theory has been developed by the Swedish physicist Arrhenius . According to him , the electric action of the sun on the upper layers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of material particles , or of droplets much bigger than electrons also charged negatively , but which are expelled from the sun by the pressure of its light . The phenomenon invoked by Arrhenius , the " Maxwell-Bartoli " pressure , is the same pressure which we used for demonstrating the possibility of // THE SUN AND ITS INFLUENCES an interplanetary migration of living cells . This has taken us very far into the region of hypothesis , but it is a region in which it is sometimes pleasant to travel . As regards the present subject , Arrhenius believes that the particles expelled from the sun by light must have a negative electric charge . That is indeed very probable , seeing that the condensation of dust and of drops takes place by preference about negative ions of gases . But if the solar atmosphere is charged with an ever-increasing excess of positive electricity , a moment must arrive when its positive charge is such that it stops any further emission of negatively charged particles . This is the serious objection which we have already had to urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On arriving in our atmosphere these particles would be relieved of their negative electricity by the ultraviolet rays of the sun , thus producing cathode rays which " ionise " the air . Thus in the theory of Arrhenius , it is again the cathode rays which govern the movements of our compasses ; but these rays are produced in the atmosphere itself , and do not come directly from the sun . Without wishing to deny that the process figured by Arrhenius might have some part in producing the magnetic variations , we must consider a point which // may deny them a preponderating influence . The point is that in the most favourable of cases the particles coming from the sun under the action of the pressure of light would require at least 40 hours to reach us from the sun . Now it has been shown for several years , and in various ways , that in every case where it has been possible to report a magnetic storm of cosmic origin having a clearly defined beginning , and to connect it to an equally clearly marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two phenomena rigorously coincide . This means that the solar agent originating the magnetic disturbances reaches us with the speed equal to that of light . This has recently been confirmed in a manner which leaves no doubt by the work of Tringali , at the Observatory of the Roman College . Since the principal solar agent of magnetic perturbation is propagated with the speed of light and therefore reaches us from the sun in eight minutes , it could not very well consist of the particles assumed by Arrhenius , which require a much longer time . Neither could it consist of cathode rays emitted direct by the sun , since the swiftest cathode rays known have a speed very much below that of light . For all these reasons we are inclined to believe that the physical agent which causes the magnetic perturbations and variations consists of Hertzian waves // which , as we have seen in connection with the socalled wireless signals from Mars , must constantly emanate from the solar atmosphere . Hertzian waves are propagated with the velocity of light . They have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traverse , being absorbed by them with the production of cathode rays . It is quite natural that as they are emitted from the sun 's atmosphere they should be more intense when that atmosphere is violently disturbed ? that is to say , in the place and at the times of sun-spots . This explains why the magnetic variations and disturbances are more frequent at those times . Finally , Hertzian waves are radiated in every direction by the electric discharge which produces them , contrary to cathode rays , which are only propagated at right angles to the electric field which emits them . This explains the observation that the magnetic disturbances of cosmic origin correspond to spots on any portion of the sun 's disc . These are some of the recent astrophysical considerations which explain the sympathies , formerly so mysterious , but now comprehensible , which link the sun across millions of miles with our mariners ' compasses , just as they attach all earthly creatures without exception to his golden chariot . What is the future of the sun ? Some people would 116 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in the destiny of a body situated at some 100,000,000 miles from the Observatory and very far away indeed from a modern drawing-room . They are wrong . It is the very future of our suffering humanity , and of its puny planetary support , which is bound up in the fate of the sun . Have you ever tried to imagine what would happen if the sun were suddenly extinguished ? The earth would be immediately plunged into an eternal night lit only by the twinkling stars . The moon would continue to accompany us in our wanderings , but it would be invisible , since its phases are only seen by reflected sunlight . Deprived of the divine warmth of the solar rays , our atmosphere would soon cool down . All water suspended in the air would fall in the shape of rain which would soon change into snow . The rivers would flood and then dry up . The entire oceans would congeal into ice , even before the gases of the air itself became condensed . Plant life would stop in a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mankind would carry on its existence a little longer with the aid of accumulated provisions and artificial heat . But soon these feeble reserves would be exhausted . In a month at the most all life on earth would be annihilated . Nothing would be left which now renders our planet so delightful and so detestable. // It would be the solution , an incontestably final solution , of all the burning questions which agitate humanity . And afterwards the other stars of the galaxy would continue endlessly on their silent way as if nothing had happened . Soon the temperature of the surface of the earth would approach the absolute zero . Humanity would then long be dead . There would be nobody left to admire the wonderful landscapes formed by this cataclysm : the oceans transformed into rocks , with glaciers of carbonic acid snow down which would flow liquid cascades of the oxygen and nitrogen of the air . From which we may see that the sun , the good old sun , is really the father and guardian of all earthly life . Men are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by light golden strings , the beams of the sun . In reality we all have the same qualities of nobility as those Chinese Emperors who fondly hoped to distinguish themselves from their simple subjects by calling themselves Sons of the Sun . In this the ancients were wiser than we . They adored and solemnly feasted the sun , seeing in him the father of all things below . The greatest ancient religions were religions of sun-worship : Indra , Baal , Moloch , Osiris , Mithra , Phoebus , and many other Egyptian , Peruvian , or Mexican idols were symbols 118 // of the sun . The babouins of Upper Egypt , who greet the sunrise every morning with their cries , have the same tradition . Their loud and discordant incantations probably chant the divine sun in their own way . Are not the majority of people inferior to these poor cynocephali , in giving no grateful thought to him ? Have they not less soul than the trembling compass agitated by the golden hair of Helios ? The dreary picture which I have drawn of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time coming , reminds us opportunely that all our sources of energy are really of solar origin : waterfalls , winds , plants , and cereals , the animals which live on them , and coal . But how much wasted gold do not the sun 's rays contain which fall upon us every day ! Their energy would suffice to melt every year a layer of ice 130 feet thick , surrounding our entire globe . This represents 265,000,000 horse-power . When our engineers transmit a few thousand horsepower over a few hundred miles , they expect to be admired , and rightly so . But what shall we say of the mechanism which , without any wires , transmits to us , over a distance of 93,000,000 miles , these thousands of millions of horse-power ? If the thousandth part of this solar energy could be utilised on earth , all the needs of human industry would be amply satisfied , social questions would be solved ? and even the question of reparations . Let // engineers therefore hurry up and gather some crumbs of that prodigious power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat of the sun will not last for ever . There are many differences of opinion as to what keeps up the heat of the sun for so many thousands of centuries . The enormous energy received by the earth is hardly the 2,000,000th part of the heat which the generous star radiates into empty space . What is it that regenerates this extraordinary dynamical reservoir , whose power seems to be undiminished since the dawn of history ? The gradual contraction of the sun suffices to account for part of it . The subsidence of materials towards its centre under the influence of gravitation produces heat automatically , as was shown by the great physicist Helmholtz . It suffices that every year , owing to this contraction , the sun 's diameter ( which it will be remembered is 860,000 miles ) diminishes by only 500 feet  --  that is , a little more than the 10,000,000th part of its value ? in order to restore the heat constantly lost . At this rate it takes nearly 30,000 years to diminish the sun 's diameter by a quantity appreciable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by calculation that before it becomes too dense to allow this concentration to continue , the sun will send us its life-giving beams for 6,000,000 or 8,000,000 years to come . // That is somewhat reassuring concerning the immediate future of our two-footed species . But will 6,000,000 years be long enough to see humanity at its present rate of progress emerge from barbarism ? I should be very chary of replying to this pessimistic question if radium had not come as a dens ex machina . That was what the ancient tragedians called a god who descended from the ceiling of the theatre by means of pulleys , windlasses and other machines when the situation had become inextricable , and by whom , at a given moment , innocence was recognised , virtue honoured , and the villains were suitably chastised . These things sometimes happen in a theatre in spite of the rule which prescribes that it should be the mirror of life . It is astonishing , in this connection , that in the presence of such an ingenious artifice certain Greek philosophers should have dared to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve any difficulty . Now , thanks to radium , we can regard the duration of the sun 's heat under a new aspect . It is well known that radium spontaneously and continuously evolves heat . The amount of heat developed by one gramme of this body in one hour would suffice to raise one gramme of water from freezing point to boiling point . Now there is no doubt that radium exists in very large quantities in the sun ; the spectro- // scope has indeed revealed the presence of large quantities of helium in its atmosphere , and this is one of the products of the disintegration of radium . Two grammes of radium per ton contained in the sun would entirely regenerate the heat lost continuously . We still lack numerical data on the exact proportion of radio-active materials contained in the sun . But henceforth we may , even at the lowest estimate , extend the future duration of solar heat far beyond the previous limit , though it may be only to prolong the agony . There is another new and bold hypothesis which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to recent researches by Jeans and Eddington , to some 20,000,000 atmospheres , obtaining at the centre of the sun , would suffice to regenerate indefinitely the radio-active bodies by acting upon the lighter elements falling from the surface . But then it is perhaps not by cold but by excess of heat that terrestrial life will be finally terminated , and we know that no organised being can survive 350 ? above zero . Henri Poincare has shown indeed that many causes , especially the resistance of the interstellar medium , accelerate the movement of the planets , which will finally fall into the sun . That will happen after an enormous time , which formerly was thought to be subsequent to the extinction of the // sun . But radium has put back the latter date so far that the contrary becomes more probable . Thus , according to the most recent theories , it is probably not cold which will annihilate earthly life . Life will be volatilised in that grand crematorium the sun . Humanity will perish like those moths who , attracted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn their wings . Calculation shows that our fall into the sun will prolong the sun 's radiation at its present rate by 95 years and 19 days . That will be the first and only time that the earth will have done something sufficiently important to be observed by those celestial inhabitants which possibly gravitate round the blue Sirius . It will be an ending in beauty . That science still hesitates between heat and cold as the method of destruction of our species proves that there is still some uncertainty about it . Let us not mock at this . The important point on which men of science are unanimous is that we still have before us at least several hundred thousand centuries . That is enough to do many great things and also many stupid things , under the vast impassive sky , which to-day is the starry banner , and to-morrow will be the immense shroud of the human army . The sun which has shone for millions of years , as shown by geology , and the sun which will shine for // hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we call it young ? Is it either of these things any more than the rose which blooms in the morning and fades in the night ? It is a question of sentiment , and is not in my purview . For those who reason in the domain of sentiment , be it ethics , faith , or art , every doctrine is true . The most perfect music , the greatest idea of justice , the most beautiful colour , is that which best harmonises with their desire or their imagination . We poor gleaners of truths have not that privilege . When in order to explain a small fact of experience we have painfully , in the course of centuries , built up a hundred theories , there is only one which is found exact ? the hundred and first . // THE GIGANTIC STRUCTURE OF THE SIDEREAL UNIVERSE Distances and distribution of the stars ? Modern measurements of parallaxes ? The map of the heavens ? Proper movements and star-drifts ? Structure of the Milky Way  --  Star-clusters ? Spiral nebul ? The great hypothesis of Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated to humble our geocentric and even our heliocentric pride . Our sun , with its retinue of negligible planets , only appears now to us as an insignificant island in the sidereal ocean , as a grain of sand on the seashore . But after all , those studies which show us our smallness in space are less humiliating than one is apt to think . They also enable us to admire the power and beauty of the methods devised by the human brain , which enable us to measure , to embrace , and to conceive , an overgrowing universe . The world of stars now reveals to us its chemical constitution , its individual and collective movement , its age and the degree of evolution of its members , their temperature , and the rhythm of its diverse pulsations . All this has furnished of late an ample harvest of discoveries . But before entering upon // those studies which concern , so to speak , the physiology of the stellar universe , a fundamental problem presents itself , that of the distances and dimensions of that universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not explore the structure of its organism without knowing the distances of its elements . How can we measure these distances in spite of their enormous extent , ? I shall first show how methods have been singularly enriched and developed . I shall then indicate the astonishing results attained by these methods ? results which , in spite of their almost fantastic character , will not appear incredible as soon as we understand how they are arrived at . The distance of the nearest stars is measured by a method identical in principle to that by which a surveyor determines the height of a point which can not be reached , such as the summit of a steeple . What does the surveyor do ? He focusses a small telescope upon the steeple , placing himself at a certain distance in one direction or another . He repeats the process at another distance , and a level attached to the instrument measures the angle of the line of vision to the horizon . Two such points and the distance between them , or what is called the base-line , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle under which the two successive points would be seen from the steeple is called the // " parallax " of the steeple in astronomical language . It is therefore by a method of surveying that the distances of the nearest stars have been determined . For the moon , for instance , the base-line chosen was that between two points on the earth 's surface , one in France and the other in America . It is clear that the measurement is the more exact the longer the base-line . To measure the distance of the sun and the nearer planets , the base-lines available on the earth have been sufficient , the longest being the diameter of our globe itself , about 8,000 miles . This length did not suffice , however , for measuring the distances of the stars , as it became clear at once that they were infinitely farther away than our sun . On focussing a telescope on the brightest of the stars from two points of the earth 's surface as far apart as possible , it was found that the lines of vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of error . This meant that the distance of these stars was practically infinite with regard to the dimensions of the earth , and that a longer base-line was necessary for these measurements . This longer base-line was obtained by focussing upon the stars at an interval of six months , when the earth is at the two ends of the diameter of its orbit around the sun . Thus the diameter itself was 127 t STRUCTURE OF SIDEREAL UNIVERSE the base-line . Since its length amounts to about 186,000,000 miles , it is 25,000 times longer than the longest terrestrial base-line . Thus for the first time the distances of several stars were measured . In spite of the enormous length of the base-line , the angle which joins the stars to its ends is so small that it required the whole precision of methods and astronomical instruments to reveal it . It has been agreed to call the parallax of a star the angle subtended by the radius of the earth 's orbit as seen from the star . The parallax of the star nearest to ourselves is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is a second of arc ? It is the angle under which one sees two objects when the distance at which they are seen is 206,265 times greater than their distance apart . For instance , it is the angle under which we should see a circle one yard in diameter , placed 206,265 yards away , or it is the angle under which we should see an object of one millimetre placed at 206 metres . The parallax of the nearest star does not attain this value . In other words , the distance of the nearest star is more than 200,000 times the length of the base-line by which it has been measured . This implies that that star is more than 400,000 times farther away from the earth than the sun itself , which has a distance of about 93,000,000 miles . // In order to illustrate this by a concrete example , I may mention that the nearest star was until recently thought to be the star Alpha in the constellation of the Centaur , which is visible only in the southern hemisphere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc . Its distance from the earth is 270,000 times greater than our distance from the sun , being 25,000,000,000,000 miles . But a new fact has recently come to light in this domain . The English astronomer Innes has discovered that the nearest star is not Alpha of the Centaur but another very small one placed in the same region , whose parallax is 019 of a second of arc . That is the nearest star hitherto known . It has been called Proxima Centauri . It has only recently been observed , as it is very faint , being of the thirteenth magnitude , whereas Alpha Centauri is of the first magnitude . And it was by photography that Mr. Lutes neasured this parallax . This curious star offers another singularity in that it has among all known stars the smallest actual brightness . Its luminosity , or the total quantity of light emitted by it , is only the 2,000th part of that emitted by our sun , which is by no means one of the brightest of the stars . It follows from all this that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars in miles , // STRUCTURE OF SIDEREAL UNIVERSE since we thus get numbers with which our imagination is not familiar , and which by their mere size fail to represent anything precisely . We must therefore express stellar distances by means of more adequate units . This has been done by means of the velocity of light . Light traverses about 186,000 miles in one second ( which is about 8 times round the earth at the equator ) . It takes little more than a second to reach the moon . It takes 8 minutes to traverse the distance between the sun and earth . It therefore takes 4 years to reach the nearest star . This example shows the convenience of expressing stellar distances by the time required by light to cover them . The " light-year " ? that is to say , the distance covered by light in one year ? has been adopted for some time in order to express sidereal dimensions . This unit had something pleasing to the imagination since time lent wings to space . But it had the inconvenience of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles by means of which astronomers are also in the habit of expressing the distances of stars . For this reason , a new unit has been recently employed in astronomy . It is the distance which corresponds to a parallax of one second . This international astronomical unit , very convenient and now generally adopted , has been called the parsec , // a name which ceases to be strange when it is remembered that it is formed from the first syllables of the words " parallax " and " second . " It expresses clearly to everybody what it means , since both words are common to the principal civilised languages . A parsec is equal to 206,265 times the mean distance of the sun and the earth . A parsec is therefore equal , as a simple calculation will show , to a little over three light-years , or to 3.256 precisely . Photography has allowed us to multiply the direct measurements of stellar distances by means of triangulation from a base-line containing the successive positions of the earth at intervals of six months . On the negatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the distant stars , which themselves remain immobile . The effect is called the annual parallax . From the amounts of these displacements observed with the micrometer the required parallaxes are deduced . By these methods the distances of the stars whose parallax is not less than 1/20th of a second of arc , acid whose distance does not therefore surpass 20 parsecs , or 4,000,000 times the distance of the sun , have been exactly determined . But most of the stars are much farther away yet , and other methods have had to be used to measure their distance . In this connection the ingenious and fruitful idea of using as the basis of the triangulation , not the // diameter of the earth 's orbit , which with its 186,000,000 miles is but a small thing in space , but the evergrowing distance covered by the whole solar system has been successfully employed . Herschell had already remarked in connection with the proper motions of the stars , that is to say , their changes of position from one year to another , that these apparent movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its retinue of planets . If you walk in the evening along the Avenue de l'Opera , beginning at the Theatre-Francois , the standard lamps which illuminate the Avenue and the lighted windows of the houses will appear to separate out as one approaches them , and will appear to move together as one walks away from them . It is the same in the sky . It has been observed that in general the proper motions of the stars are such that certain constellations seem to grow and expand in some way from year to year , whereas the constellations on the opposite side seem to contract and their stars seem to join each other . It follows that the sun moves in the direction of the former , and away from the latter . The direction in which we seem to be carried , and which is called the apex of the sun 's motion , is not far from the beautiful blue northern star known by the name of Vega . The spectroscopic methods which I have mentioned , and which employ the Doppler-Fizeau principle , enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar system moves , but even to determine with precision the speed of this displacement , which is 12 miles per second , relative to the whole system of the stars . This movement transports our system in the course of a century to a distance over 400 times the distance separating the sun and the earth . It therefore furnishes for the triangulation of the universe a baseline which at the end of 20 years is 40 times as great as the diameter of the earth 's orbit . The approximate distances of a great number of stars have been determined by this method . A process connected with this has also been much used . It is no longer founded on the study of the displacement of the stars , but on the photometric comparison of their apparent brightness . It is known that the brightness of a source varies inversely as the square of the distance , being reduced to onequarter when the distance is doubled , and to a hundredth when the distance is increased tenfold . It is reasonable to suppose that the stars have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method has furnished precious information which agrees with previous results . 1 now come to some extremely ingenious and novel methods . They are physical and not geometrical methods , and they have recently given us a stupendous outlook upon the distances of certain groups of stars // which formerly appeared to be altogether beyond our limits of computation . Here is first of all the curious procedure proposed by the American astronomer , Adams . It had been noticed that the relative intensity of the lines of a given spectrum ? such as the spectrum of iron ? depends on several physical conditions , and particularly on the pressure under which the vapour of iron becomes incandescent . Different stars sometimes have very different dimensions and masses , and hence the pressure at the surface of the photosphere ( which radiates their light ) must vary from one star to another . It was therefore to be expected that we could observe in the relative intensities of stellar spectrum lines certain differences which would enlighten us concerning the masses and relative sizes of different stars of the same spectrum type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing stars of known distance and known real brightness , he found differences in the relative intensities of the various spectrum lines corresponding to a given metal . The greater the differences between the total brightness of the stars the more intense are certain lines . Applying the same process to the whole series of stars whose distances , and consequently whose brightnesses were known , he found a constant relation between the brightnesses and the relative intensities of the spectrum lines . So Adams pro- // posed to deduce the relative luminosities of the stars from the relative intensity of these rays . Thus he found , for instance , that in the case of a given star of the same apparent brightness as another star whose distance was known , the actual brightness was nine times greater than that of the latter . Consequently it would have to be three times farther away from us . Such was the case . The results so obtained for a fairly large number of stars are found to agree with what had already been determined from the geometrical measurement of their parallaxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we have a process with an immense future , which allows us by a simple spectroscopic study of light to ascertain the distances of the most distant stars . The applications of the method are practically unlimited , since it is applicable whenever the light of a star is intense enough to be analysed in the spectroscope . Finally there is another kind of star among variable stars , the study of which has opened up to us a way into hitherto inaccessible depths of stellar space . These are the Cepheids , thus called from the best-known star of that type , Delta in the constellation Cepheus . That star increases in brightness for a certain number of hours ; then having reached a maximum it wanes , but more slowly , down to a minimum , after // which its light quickly increases again and repeats the same cycle indefinitely . This particular rhythm of the Cepheids has some resemblance to the tides which in our oceans continually rise and fall in something like the same fashion . These Cepheid variables have recently acquired a capital importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct means has been found of ascertaining their real brightness , and hence also their distance . An American astronomer , Miss Leavit , of the Harvard Observatory , whilst studying a fairly large number of Cepheid variables found in a small starcluster called Magellan 's Cloud , noticed that the length of their variable period , or the time which separates two maxima or two minima , depends very closely upon their relative brightness . All the stars of the little Cloud of Magellan are thus no doubt physically linked , and therefore are nearly at the same distance from us . Now it is found that among the Cepheids of this cluster the brightest ? that is to say , the largest ? have a period of variation longer than that of the smaller ones . This period varies for the Cepheids of this cluster from 1 day to 127 days , and Miss Leavit has proved that there is a simple numerical relation between the real magnitude , or rather the real brightness , of a Cepheid and its period of variation . This law , which agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need not enter here ? has been verified in the case of other star-clusters containing Cepheids , and also in several relatively near bright Cepheids , whose distances are known by direct measurements of parallax . The law has always ' been found to be rigorously exact . Thus it is known that the real brightness of a Cepheid whose period of variation lasts one day is a hundred times greater than that of the sun ; that when the period is one of 10 days its brightness is 1,500 times that of the sun , and so on . This method has enabled us to know the real brightnesses and therefore the distances of a great number of stars , and thus has enabled us to sound unexplored depths of the sky . It now remains to enumerate the surprising results of all these vast soundings of the universe . It shows at all events that in the chaplet of the stars our yellow sun is only a ridiculous little amber bead . As regards the things which turn round that bead , the less said the better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these measurements and numberings which have revealed the structure of the sidereal universe , or at least the little we know of it . Considering that the measurement of the exact position of every star observed in our telescopes takes // several minutes ; also that there are more than 6,000,000 stars down to the eleventh magnitude , and more than 400,000,000 down to the fourteenth magnitude , the preparation of a complete chart of the heavens originally appeared to be a superhuman enterprise . But photography had not then been taken into account . Thanks to photography it is now possible to register in a few minutes on a plate tens of thousands of stars which obediently come and inscribe their own relative positions . The photographic plate which fixes the flying moment and revives at will that which has perished has become the mirror of the sky itself . The grains of sensitive silver imprison for us an image of the whole firmament . Thus was born the idea of a vast photographic directory of the stars , the first portion of which , comprising stars down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars ? is now finished . At the present time the 22,154 negatives , corresponding to as many small squares into which the celestial vault has been , so to speak , divided , have all been obtained . This work has been carried out by 18 observatories , distributed all round the earth , which have divided up the work in a harmonious collaboration . The nations do not always understand each other in dealing with this little planet . We have noticed // on the other hand that whenever zones of influence have been marked out in the planetary system , or " mandates " in the Milky Way , they have come to agreement without the spilling of blood , and proceeded together to the pacific penetration of the vast universe . Let this console us for that . If , by the way , the photographic chart of the sky is an international achievement , it is French astronomy which has had the honour of creating it and bringing about its adoption by other nations . It has also designed the photographic telescope , or astrograph used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are by some deeper soundings made with instruments more powerful than the Kodaks of the photographic chart , have yielded a great harvest of discoveries . In the first place they have enabled us to distinguish a great number of variable stars , and new small planets circulating between Mars and Jupiter . That is not all . If the stars were on the average as numerous in the neighbourhood of the sun as in the more distant regions of the universe , calculation shows that there would have to be on the negatives four times as many stars of the seventh magnitude as of the sixth , four times as many stars of the eighth magnitude as of the seventh , and so on . Now , the census of the negatives shows that there are only three times more approximately , and not four . // The conclusion is that the sun is not far from the centre of a fairly dense group of stars which may either be the Milky Way , or an assemblage which is more localised , but included within the Milky Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for on the scale of sidereal distances heliocentric and geocentric views are practically identical , though the prosecution of Galileo once put them into violent opposition . But that prosecution was a little local case , a parish quarrel . Will the chart of the heavens revive our conceit which had received so many blows ? Will it allow us again to consider our system as the centre of the stellar universe , and the latter as a charming frame , solely designed to contain , like a medallion , our egoistic vanity ? Alas , no , for a closer study of the distribution of the stars shows that the sun , though not on the confines of the galactic system , is yet found in an eccentric situation . Several thousands of light-years separate us from the probable centre of this ring . This eccentric position helps us to understand one of the most curious discoveries made on the negatives of the celestial chart . This discovery made by Professor Kapteyn , of Groningen , has since been fully confirmed . The sidereal movements do not take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stars photographed can be divided into two groups which cross each other , and 140
