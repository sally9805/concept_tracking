txt Riding roughshod over recommendations made in behalf of President Coolidge , the House Naval Affairs Committee today , by a practically . unanimous vote , decided that in framing the $740,000,000 bill for additions to the fleet it should be specifically provided that the program shoull be laid down in five years and completed in eight years , and that the President should have no authority to suspend work in the event of another naval limitation conference . The committee majority made it plain in debate that it intended to report a bill making it mandatory on the President to go ahead with a building program and to put the finishing touches on it at the end of the eight-year period . It was recalled that of the eight cruisers authorized in 1924 six were yet to be built . A resolution was adopted declaring it to be the sense of the committee that the building bill " shall provide for a five-year program to be completed in eight years , stating the maximum number of ships to be undertaken each year and the maximum cest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program adopted by Congress . " Fifteen members voted for this resolution and one , Representative McClintic , Democrat , of Oklahoma , answered " Present . " Only One Dissenting Vote . By a vote of 15 to 1 the committee , on motion of Representative Burdick Republican , of Rhode Island , struck from the bill prepared by Secretary Wilbur the provision that " in the event of an international conference for the limitation of naval armaments " the President might , in his discretion , suspend any or all of the construction authorized . Hearings on the naval building bill will be continued for several days . Secretary Wilbur and officers of the navy will be heard again on the Wilbur proposal for seventy-one ships , and then the committee will go into executive session to decide upon the program . Indications are that the bill to be reported , so far as ships arc concerned , viii approximate the program devised by Secretary Wilbur with the approval of President Coolidge and General Lord , Director of the Budget . Today 's discussion disclosed that a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further reduced by international conference in the near future . The majority indicated that it was opposed to a policy of waiting for such conclusions and that in the forthcoming bill it would lay down a hard and fast program under conditions that would immediately impel the President to proceed with the work of construction . There ? were suggestions that the immittee would insist upon building " ships of steel " instead of blue-print , ships. , Lays Down the Principle . " Our action today lays down the principle upon which the measure to be reported will be based , " said Chairman Butler . " The committee later will decide on the program . " It is the opinion of the committee that what we do in the way of a program should be carried out and the ships actually built . If only an authorization were made , without a time limit , we might find ourselves in the position created by the authorization of eight cruisers in 1924 , six of which are yet to be built . " I believe that when Congress declares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose now is to build ships for the navy , and there is no reason why that should not be done . " " When the program was submitted to the committee by the Navy Department it was announced that the building involved was ' not in conflict with the President 's financial pro- gram , ' and Mr. Coolidge approved it with that stipulation present in the bill , " said Representative McClintic . " I voted against the motion to eliminate from the bill the privilege granted the President to suspend the building program , as I believed that he desired this authority in the event the nations decided to meet in conference to discuss limitation of armament . " I felt that if the committee took action which the President in so many words asked not to be taken , it would be like a slap in the face , so I voted against the motion to strike out the paragraph in the bill . " Mr. McClintic insisted that the time might come when another conference would be called to decide on further naval limitation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President may want to send American delegates , and they should have the same authority to order a cessation of naval building by the United States that was given to our delegates at the first Washington conference . The President should not be required to call a special session of Congress to obtain this authority . " May Vote More Submarines . Representative Britten of Illinois predicted that the new program would entail total appropriations of $740,000,000 , and that , so far as building was concerned , there would be only one change in the plan submitted by Secretary Wilbur . He said he believed the number of submarines would be increased from thirty-two , the number recommended by Secretary Wilbur , to thirty-five . He thought that on the other items , namely , twenty-five cruisers , five aircraft carriers and nine destroyer leaders , the committee would accept the Wilbur proposal as submitted in December . " The committee , " said Chairman Butler , " practically unanimously agreed to write into the bill a fiveyear program specifically stating the number and character of ships to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be appropriated for new construction , and the committee did this in opposition to the expressed request of the Secretary of the Navy , speaking for the President , who did not desire a time limit incorporated in the bill . " Members of the committee said they wanted ships and not limitation conferences , and the quicker the ships are constructed the more pleasing it will be to an almost unanimous Committee on Naval Affairs . Still smarting under the disastrous results of the Washington conference , the committee agreed to strike from the bill that section which authorized the President to cancel the construction program in the event of the calling of another naval limitation conference . The committee refused to delegate to any future President the right to stop ship construction , preferring to leave future decision in this regard to Congress rather than to the executive branch of the Government . Building Program in Outline . " I believe the committee will report a bill providing for one aircraft carrier a year for five years at a cost of $19,000,000 for each ship ; for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,000,000 each ; for five cruisers a year for five years at a cost of $17,000,000 each , and for nine destroyer leaders spread over a period of three years at a cost of $5,000,000 each , and for total appropriations of $740,000,000 , to extend over eight years , as follows : " First year , $55,200,000 ; second year , $110,400,000 ; third year , $141 , - 100,000 ; fourth year , $141,500,000 ; fifth year , $139,000,000 ; sixth year , $93,800,000 ; seventh year , $48,600,000 ; eighth year , $10,400,000 . Total , $740 , - 000,000 . " Mr. Britten expressed the belief that the committee would not include salvage ships in the pending bill . " We are providing for fighting ships in this program , " he said . " If , in the light of investigations now pending , we can get sound guidance as to the type of ship that should be constructed to deal with such emergencies as were presented by the sinking of the S-4 , we can take that up as aniedependent prop-osition , "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
