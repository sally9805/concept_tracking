President Ella Alexander Boole of the National W. C. T. U officially declared last week that " we can not compromise " on Sunday openings of the Sesquicentennial Exposition at Philadelphia . She withdrew " the W. C. T. U. exhibits and moral support . The Exposition already had lost the moral support of Presbyterians , Methodists and Lutherans . <P> Mayor Kendrick and the exposition managers need fee-paying and , according to Henry Ford 's Dearborn Independent , graft-paying concessionaires . These , in turn , will come only if they may operate on Sundays , the most profitable amusement day of the week in the U. S. <P> Strict Sabbatarians are determined to make this Sesquicentennial Sunday closing an issue which may have greater repercussions throughout the country than the Fundamentalist-Modernist row . Sabbath Associations last week sent representatives to Harrisburg , Pa. , the state capital . These gentlemen spoke so intimately , so forcibly , to State Attorney General George Washington Woodruff , that he changed his mind from its former course , and immediately instituted quo warranto proceedings against the Sesquicentennial management . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
