' ' You should have better sense . Love , " cabled Mrs. Henry J. Pierce to her husband in Manhattan . He had pleaded with her over the telephone and cable and through the U. S. State Department not to sail on the Graf Zeppelin from Friedrichshafen . She did sail , early one fair morning last week , with Susi , female gorilla , 17 male passengers and the Zeppelin 's crew of 40 ( Dr. Hugo Eckener commanding ) . <P> The Graf Zeppelin made a sweet passage from Friedrichshafen ( on the German-Swiss border ) , down the Rhone Valley , across the Gulf of Lions , toward Gibraltar . Then the crankshaft of one of her five engines broke . Near Cartagena , Spain , Commander Eckener turned her back towards Friedrichshafen . <P> And then began a night and day of struggle . Two more engines went out of commission . The ship reached the Rhone . <P> Rushing down and against her went the mistral , the draft which comes from France 's coolish central plateau and ends over the warmish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind tossed and whirled the ship . A fourth engine went dead . Only one remained to drive her and that was not enough . Commander Eckener headed her south and floated with the wind . <P> At Cuers-Pierrefeu. about ten miles from Toulon , there is the mooring mast of the lost Dixmude , France 's only dirigible , and her hangar . French officials , who before the flight had put many a peckish restriction on the Graf Zeppelin 's crossing France , wirelessed Commander Eckener to try to reach Cuers-Pierrefeu . He succeeded . A company of Senegalese troops pulled the ship to earth and walked her into the hangar . Passengers , weary , pretended unconcern over their dangers . Most of them declared that they would wait until the ship 's motors were replaced and she would start again for the U. S. That , it was apparent , would not be for several weeks .
