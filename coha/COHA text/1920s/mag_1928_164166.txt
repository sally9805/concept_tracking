Buddha , the most placid of the prophets , would himself have been perturbed by a letter which was received last week at the Buddhist Center , of Manhattan . The letter was signed by Professor Nicholas Roerich ; it had been despatched from the terrain that lies north of the Himalayas , where the Roerich American Expedition ( TIME , June 4 ) is now located .

In condensed form , the letter said : Buddhism in Tibet , its ancient stronghold , has become a depraved Shamanistic religion . The celebrated Tashi Lumpo monastery , residence of the abdicated Tashi Lama , has been deserted and desecrated .

The forest-dwelling Buddhists revere arrows and absurd amulets . Conscious reverence for Buddha is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen into ruin .

It is sponsored by the Roerich Museum , Manhattan , which last week announced plans for skyscraper headquarters .
