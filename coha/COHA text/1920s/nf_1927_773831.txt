txt Ioo THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE phase of the work of these two men , as bearing upon the scientific renaissance , which deserves emphasis . This pertains to the influence their writings had upon the least established of the fields of scientific inquiry , upon that branch which attempts to study so-called mental as distinguished from physical phenomena ; that is , the field of psychology . In bringing to the fore again the old controversy waged between Plato and Aristotle as to the relative importance of intuition and observation , Descartes and Bacon opened wide the door to nearly related metaphysical speculations previously kept closed through the power of ecclesiasticism . Man in his new-found mental freedom attempted once more to solve the main riddles of the universe ? the existence of God and the soul , the freedom of the will , the relative importance of the physical and the mental worlds ? believing that many problems related to the inner life of the mind , which still remain outside the pale of scientific inquiry , can he studied by the exact methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphysical questions ? though of ultimate concern to every rational being ? are as yet beyond the scope of scientific investigation . With the fetters of medieval despotism removed , Bacon and Descartes and their followers examined without discrimination the whole gamut of metaphysical problems , even as the ancient Greeks had examined them ? fearlessly and honestly . And the same differences in personality and interests which led Bacon and Descartes to stand at opposite poles in their treatment of scientific method caused them to found opposing schools of metaphysics and mental philosophy . As in astronomy , the revolt from medieval authority in metaphysics started in Italy , where it led to the martyrdom of Bruno , who not only supported the Copernican theory but broke away from current theological dogmas as well . THE SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE IOI He was followed by the Italian Campanella , who laid emphasis upon certain basic psychological facts ; but the vigorous reprisals of the Roman Inquisition soon stilled Italian metaphysical and psychological utterance . Meanwhile , in England , the seventeenth century had opened with the virulent ' attacks of Francis Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ecclesiastical , and metaphysical alike ? but on many other current modes of thinking . Bacon demonstrated , among other things , that the human mind has a tendency to accept many statements as proved though no proof whatsoever has been submitted . He pointed out that people have numerous prejudices which they have never analyzed ? prejudices handed down from one generation to the next and unquestioningly adhered to ; prejudices accepted because of personal idiosyncrasy ; prejudices that we get from public addresses or from our friends ; and prejudices arising out of dogmatic statements which we accept by virtue of the fact that they have been dogmatically made and for no other reason . Our prepossessions haunt the minds of all of us , Bacon explained , and hamper us in our attempts to think rationally . Modern psychology has but served to verify this analysis . It has pointed out , in addition , that we engage in much daydreaming , make many snap judgments , easily find excuses for holding fast to our beliefs , and attempt critical thinking very seldom . The formula that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientifically most of the time has not yet been found . We come now to the second half of the seventeenth century , the period following the brilliant work of Galileo , Kepler , Gilbert , Harvey , and Bacon , and at the threshold of which Descartes made his effective appeal . The sectarian conflicts mentioned at the beginning of the last chapter had temporarily subsided , but soon we see France reverse her // role of protector of Protestantism and of the independence of states , and plunge the Continent into another turmoil of religious and political intrigue . At the same time , we observe Great Britain , after a brief interlude of political backsliding , abolish the absolute power of kings in her Bill of Rights ( in 1688 ) and become politically and otherwise the most tolerant and progressive among the nations . France was still politically supreme , but England was already threatening that supremacy . A number of able thinkers in Great Britain followed Bacon 's critical analysis of the human mind . Among the outstanding exponents of the English school of thought which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century and Hume in the eighteenth . It would be going out of our way , to enter into the various speculations of this school ; for speculate these men did , despite their belief that they were following the inductive method pure and simple , as one significant fact will serve to demonstrate . The same reasoning which led Thomas Hobbes , a young contemporary of Bacon , to a materialistic conclusion in his analysis of the inner and outer worlds , led Bishop Berkeley , half a century later , to a spiritualistic one . In the interim , John Locke had taken an intermediate position , and in the next century David I fume once more attempted to find a middle ground on this vexing question of the relative importance of mind and matter . Contemporaneously with Ilobbes , Rene Descartes in France had been throwing his full genius into the scale of speculative theorizing , basing his contentions on mathematical grounds and insisting that by introspection the great truths of metaphysics and psychology can be deduced . His invention of analytical geometry had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I think , therefore I am " ? cogito , ergo sum  --   --  has echoed and reTHE // echoed from his day to our own . He postulated what he felt were three fundamental hypotheses for metaphysics : first , that the ego exists ; second , that God exists ; and , third , that the corporeal world exists . Out of these hypotheses he evolved a dualism of mind and matter , and in doing so rendered an important service to psychology by giving dramatic emphasis to the reality of mind . Yet at the same time he rendered her a disservice also , by maintaining that the scientific methods of investigating material phenomena must be essentially different from those used to investigate mental facts . He thus became the founder of the so-called introspective school in psychology . Following Descartes , Baruch Spinoza in Holland indicated many ways in which the dual elements of mind and matter are intimately correlated and yet distinct . And a decade or two after this , about 1684 , Gottfried Leibnitz , the great German scientist and metaphysician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same " essence " can be both mind and matter in different manifestations . Leibnitz became the precursor of the spiritualistic school of metaphysicians , as opposed to the materialism of Hobbes , by hypothesizing that matter in its essence does not consist of deadness and inertia but of energy and force , an assumption quite generally borne out by modern advances in physics but having no known facts to substantiate it in the seventeenth century . In the eighteenth century , Immanuel Kant developed the Descartes-Leibnitz reasoning further . The metaphysical speculations of Leibnitz were eclipsed in 1690 by the publication in England of John Locke 's famous " Essay Concerning Human Understanding , " in which he took sharp issue with his German contemporary . Building upon what Bacon and Hobbes had started , Locke insisted that all speculations about the soul , material " esI04 THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE sences , " and the like were so much folderol , that all knowledge comes to us from the outside world by observation and sensation , and that there is no innate knowledge whatsoever . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with this difference : concurrent advances in physics and mathematics , especially those having to do with sound and light , had given a new meaning to the superficial psychological facts then available regarding sensation , and Locke and Leibnitz and their adherents made use of these new discoveries . The significant point for us here is that , despite this help from physics , the essential character of the metaphysical controversy beginning with Bacon and Descartes , and continuing for two centuries , remained unchanged . Bearing in mind what was said earlier in this . chapter regarding the mutual and complementary character of speculation and observation , of deduction and induction , it is apparent that neither the Descartes-Leibnitz-Kant school nor the BaconLocke-I hone school had the whole truth on its side . The contributions of the one Lty in pointing out the need for common-sense hypotheses in psychology as in other sciences and in emphasizing the . obvious dualism of mind and matter as a starting-point for psychological investigation . Its shortcomings lay in its insistence upon introspection as the only psychological method , which meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of other sciences , and in its failure to appreciate the value of induction for purposes of separating useless and futile speculations from those that can be utilized as tentative hypotheses for further psychological fact gathering . The chief contribution of the English school lay in insisting upon observational and experimental methods , which . insistence led finally to the abandonment of untrammeled speculation in psychology . Its shortcomings lay in its in THE // ability to , appreciate the value of carefully drawn hypotheses for scientific purposes , and in its use of metaphysical theorizing despite its protests to the contrary . Its attempts to explain mind away in terms of matter ( Hobbes ) and matter away in terms of mind ( Berkeley ) , and its efforts to determine whether we can really know anything or not , were just as futile metaphysical excursions as the theorizing of the school it opposed . The real difficulty of seventeenth and eighteenth century psychology was appreciated by neither school ; namely , there was too much speculation with too few facts to go on , which facts , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing the speculative theories to an irreducible minimum ? a minimum on which all workers could agree ? and in collecting more and better psychological facts . Yet it must not be overlooked that it was just such discussions as Locke and Leibnitz engaged in , wholly speculative and largely futile so far as psychology proper was concerned , which led to a clearing of the atmosphere , a separation of metaphysical from psychological interests , and a definition of the scope of the new science . Out of the smoke of argument and counter-argument lasting for another century after Locke , it ultimately became clear that psychology must rest her claims to be called a science on more modest grounds than metaphysical ones . Once more the main riddles of the universe had to be put aside . Not that this renders these vital questions one whit less important or insistent . It simply emphasizes that , as yet constituted , scientific knowledge is unable to encompass them . First the demonstration of the existence of God or the soul had to be excluded from psychological consideration . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and body together and making them one , was likewise set aside . And , finally , it came to be appreciated that to try to tof ) THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE argue matter away in terms of mind , or mind away in terms of matter , was equally futile for psychology . Not until psy-chology settled down to accepting the dualism of mind and body as a working hypothesis , and turned over to meta-physics the other questions mentioned , could it proceed to build upon a secure and acceptable basis . And yet even to-day there are psychologists who persist in confusing psychological with metaphysical issues , not content appar-ently with the less pretentious hypotheses underlying modern psychology . With respect to the meagerness and superficiality of sev-enteenth and eighteenth century psychological facts , two points will bear emphasis . One is that the Cartesian insist-ence on introspection as the distinctive method for psycho-logical investigation served for a considerable period to prevent psychologists from looking in the right direction for further facts . The other concerns itself with the inti-mate relation between psychological and biological data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , those having to do with the functioning of the brain , the spinal cord , the sense organs , and the rest of the nervous system ? were not available during this period . In the interim , clearing the atmosphere of metaphysical pre-suppositions was a most necessary first step to later con-structive advance . ? 3 Progress in natural history , as geology and biology were still called , was also tremendously stimulated in the second half of the seventeenth century . Cordus , Vesalius , and Harvey had broken away from the authority of the ancients in biology , and physics had advanced to the point where the microscope could be made use of in nature study . Many of the mathematical physicists of Galileo 's day and immediTHE // ately following worked on the problems of optics , and by the middle of the century lens makers arose in England and on the Continent who supplied usable microscopes and telescopes . Just as the telescope stimulated astronomical progress , so the microscope stimulated biological and geological progress . In 1665 a remarkable book , entitled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physicist Robert Hooke , in the preface of which the value of the microscope to the naturalist is expressed thus : The next care to be taken , in respect to the senses , is a supplying of their infirmities with instruments , and , as it were , the adding of artificial organs to the natural ; this for cane of the senses has been of late years accomplished with prodigious benefit to all sorts of useful knowledge , by the invention of optical glasses . . . . It seems not improbable , but that by these helps the subtlety of the composition of bodies , the structure of their parts , the various textures of their matter , the instruments and manner of their inward motions , and all the other possible appearances of things , may come to be more fully discovered . Hooke 's volume is replete with illustrations of microscopic examinations of animals and plants and makes mention for the first time of those " little boxes or cells " which were later to be recognized as among the fundamentals of scientific biology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the " world of the infinitely small " with their microscopes as Galileo had opened up the heavens with his telescope . The work of these two Hollanders was of outstanding importance . The microscopic school , which they represent , created an epoch for biological research . The greatest biological thinker of this period , however , was Marcello Malpighi of Bologna ( 1628-1694 ) , an outt ( ) S THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE standing genius . Malpighi developed many branches of biological study previously non-existent . At seventeen he was already amusing himself with the microscope . At twentyone he entered the University of Bologna to study medicine . Later he was professor of medicine at the Universities of Pisa , Messina , and Bologna . He served his native university for more than twenty-five years , until in failing health he withdrew to Rome to become private physician to Pope Innocent XII . Upon Malpighi 's death three years later , his writings were carefully preserved and published . Malpighi 's discoveries in human physiology are on a par with those of his illustrious predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six years before Harvey 's death , IVlalpighi discovered , and Leeuwenhoek later amplified the discovery , that the blood circulates not only by way of the arteries and veins but likewise by means of fine , hair-like tubes or capillaries connecting the arteries and veins at various points and now known to extend to the minutest parts of the body . Without the microscope these hair-like tubes could not have been discovered , nor could the blood corpuscles , which Malpighi discerned several years afterward . Malpighi was among the first to use the microscope with scientific effect in the study of animal and vegetable structures . He combined this study with his practice of vivisection with striking results . In this way he analyzed the structure of the lungs , the kidneys , the spleen , the skin , and the brain . Many paths opened out from Malpighi 's work , some of them leading to the special fields known to-day as classification , histology , plant physiology , embryology , and genetics . He did pioneer work in geology also . Although Malpighi , Leeuwenhoek , Swammerdam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances by means of the microscope , the basic facts of anatomy , physiology , and embryology still remained to be // worked out . Until they were , so many false theories held the field that a proper scientific perspective in biological research was impossible . Malpighi himself , though he paved the way for important later discoveries , held false conceptions regarding the origin of life and the structure of animal tissues . Concerning the origin of life , many speculations , fantastic to us with our wider knowledge , were being put forth . Highly developed vertebrates , such as eels , were conceived as spontaneously generated out of the void or out of mud , and fossils were regarded as the remains of halfformed beings , uncompleted , much as though the Creator got tired while he was fashioning them and left them only partly finished . Redi and Steno , contemporaries of Malpighi , made noteworthy attempts to dispel these false notions ; but Steno 's pamphlet on geological formations , published in 1669 , the most important geological document of that century , received no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments to show that maggots are not spontaneously generated out of decaying meat , but are produced from flies ' eggs deposited on the meat , proved inconclusive . Only within recent years has the last of these misconceptions been thrown into the discard . In Malpighi 's day , too few microscopic facts had been brought to light , and virtually nothing was known about the important foundation subjects of organic and inorganic chemistry , to dispel the false theories thrown about biology and geology . In this respect , the observation must be repeated which was made regarding the psychological development of the renaissance period . Just as the complete clearing of the atmosphere in psychology had to await the firm establishment of biology , certain fundamentals in physics and chemistry had to be established before the false theories of the fields of nature study could be swept away . The revolutionizing effect upon biology of the application of the microT rn THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE scope ( a product of physics ) has already been indicated . Further progress in physical science had to come before biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact gathering and exploration of the world of the microscope were being carried on as necessary preliminaries . 4 The effect of the scientific renaissance upon chemistry and physics was even more important than its effect upon the fields just reviewed . Chemistry had not yet become a distinct department of scientific inquiry , but the foundationstones of physics were ready to be laid when Galileo had completed his epoch-making researches in mechanics . Descartes 's invention of analytic geometry was likewise important for advances here . Soon after the middle of the seventeenth century , in fact , physics was placed upon a scientific basis . Somewhat earlier , also , scientists interested in border-line problems involving both chemistry and physics were doing constructive work in clearing away misconceptions surrounding these fields . At the beginning of the seventeenth century , to retrace our steps for a moment , many false notions of long standing were clinging to those intangible phases of physical and chemical phenomena having to do with the atmosphere , and with heat , light , sound , electricity , and magnetism . Although Galileo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in astrology and alchemy , many others were rife , and some continued for a century or more . Prominent at this time among the pioneers who struck out boldly against age-old superstition was a young English contemporary of Galileo , Robert Boyle ( 1627-1691 ) . Born in Ireland a year after the death of Francis Bacon and fifteen years before Galileo died , Robert Boyle , the THE SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE I l l seventh son of the Earl of Cork , was favored both by heri tage and environment . Robert was precocious as a child and highly susceptible to suggestion , as is evidenced by his pick-ing up the habit of stuttering from one of his playmates , a habit which later proved to be unbreakable . When eight years old he was sent to England to be educated at Eton , where he remained four years . By the age of twelve , he had mastered a considerable portion of Latin , French , and mathematics , and was engaged in writing verse and study ing the Scriptures . No signs of scientific predilection had manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact inclining him toward the ministry , and he remained devoutly religious throughout his life . In 1638 , he began a six-year trip with a brother , visiting and studying in Holland , France , Switzerland , and Italy . He arrived in Italy at the time of the passing of Galileo and made a study of the life and works of the celebrated Italian . This im pressed him profoundly and probably did more than any-thing else to start him on a scientific career . Boyle was seventeen when he returned home in 1644 , upon the death of his father ( his mother having died when he was a child of three ) , and found himself heir to a con siderable estate . The next ten years was an unsettled period for him , although by no means an unprofitable one . Most of his time was divided between his Irish estates in Ulster and the home of a sister who lived in London . England was in a political turmoil ; but a small group of investigators , un interested in politics , had banded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Boyle spent many pleasant and profitable hours attending their gatherings . When in 1654 he moved to Oxford to equip a laboratory and settle down to serious experimental work , he and others continued these informal gatherings there . Soon their importance became generally recognized , // and in 1660 , through the aid of King Charles , the Royal Society for the Advancement of Learning was officially created . To-day the highest distinction a scientist can receive in England is to be elected a fellow of this society and to be allowed to place " F.R.S . " after his name . Boyle was a member of the council of the Royal Society from its inception , and most of the meetings which preceded its formation and for some time afterward were held in his laboratory at Oxford . These brought together the most eminent English scientists of the day , and many important problems came up for discussion . As a result Boyle became particularly interested in the current practices and claims of the alchemists , on the one hand , and , on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure and suction that were being carried on in Italy , France , and Germany . In 1661 he published an important work entitled " The Sceptical Chymist , " in which he severely criticized charlatanry and urged that chemistry be studied for its own sake . Up to that time chemical phenomena had been pursued chiefly as an aid to alchemy and medicine . In his book Boyle questions the practices of the alchemists . He complains that they play with words , that their writings are intolerably ambiguous , and that they deliberately obscure their meanings . He writes : If judicious men skilled in chymical affairs shall agree to write clearly and plainly of them , and thereby keep men from being stunned , as it were , or imposed upon by dark and empty words , ' t is to be hoped that these men the alchemists finding that they can no longer write impertinently and absurdly , without being laughed at for doing so , will be reduced either to write nothing , or books that may teach us something , and not rob men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trouble the world with riddles or imperTHE // tinencies , we shall either by their books receive an advantage , or by their silence escape an inconvenience . The alchemists had had things largely their own way . They ? as well as the astrologers ? had taken the so-called elements of the ancient Greeks ? earth , air , fire , and water ? and had built upon them a mysterious " system " through which they asserted base metals could be transmuted into gold and an elixir of youth could be compounded . In these latter days we have actually succeeded in transmuting one element into another and by gland transplantation and other means have made the aged young again , so that we can not say that the dreams of the alchemists were entirely fantastic . It was not their dreams which were misleading but their practices . Leaving out of account the charlatans who fattened on tribute from their dupes , those alchemists who were in earnest were not going at things in a scientific way . They accepted the written words of previous alchemists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of their search . Boyle 's book discredited this whole procedure and urged a new approach . He insisted , among other things , that the alchemists ' use of the term " element " was misleading , and that it should not be applied to compounds of more elementary substances , but only to " certain primitive and simple , or perfectly unmingled bodies ; which , not being made of any other bodies or of one another , " are the ingredients out of which compounds are made and " into which they are ultimately resolved . " This distinction between chemical elements and their compounds , first proposed by Boyle in 1661 , is still adhered to at the present time . No generalization has proved more serviceable for chemical advance . To-day we know that none of the four things labeled I14 THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE " elements " by the ancient Greeks is such in any real sense . Water is a compound of the two elements hydrogen and oxygen ; the earth and the air are composed of many elements ; while fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon which accompanies combustion and which was not understood until comparatively recent years . In Boyle 's day fire was thought of as material in character ( which it is not ) , whereas the material nature of the air had not yet been fully recognized . Before Galileo , virtually nothing was known about the atmosphere , the prevailing ignorance being summed up in the dictum laid down by Aristotle that Nature " abhors a vacuum , " and , horrified at seeing one , causes explosions and other noises in her haste to fill empty spaces with air . This crude notion served fo explain in part many otherwise inexplicable happenings . If the air , for example , is sucked out of a vessel having only one small opening , no way being provided for other air to get in and the walls of the vessel being fairly thin , why should the walls collapse with a sud= den bang unless Nature were disturbed about the situation ? It was not then known that air is material and has weight , and therefore exerts considerable pressure against anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel presses against the inside walls , counteracting the push from without . Remove the internal pressure of the air by withdrawing it , and the walls may be unable to sustain the outside push . With the actual causes unknown , the effect of a vessel 's collapse under circumstances as just described must have been startling . Galileo had satisfied himself that the air has weight by weighing a vessel filled with it and then forcing in additional air and weighing again . Two of his pupils ( Torricelli and Viviani ) went further and demonstrated that , under suitable conditions , the pressure of the atmosphere will actually // hold up or sustain a column of mercury . To understand the Torricelli experiment , one need but picture an inverted glass test-tube suspended over a dish of mercury with the open end of the tube just immersed in the mercury and the air in the tube removed ? by some means that we need not go into . The push of the air on the mercury in the dish will force the mercury up into the inverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air pressure in the tube to counteract and prevent this . Pascal , a young French genius , took the next step . He argued that if Torricelli 's conclusions regarding air pressure are correct , the height of his mercury column should grow less as one ascends into high altitudes , where the air is rarer and therefore must exert less force . Arranging that a Torricelli tube be taken to the top of a mountain , Pascal found that the mercury column dropped three inches in the ascent , thus giving further support to Torricelli 's experiment and initiating the use of barometers for measuring atmospheric pressure . Torricelli 's tube constituted the first barometer . Meanwhile in Germany even more surprising results of experiments on air pressure were forthcoming . A German scientist by the name of Guericke had tried to draw water from a tightly sealed cask , but he could not prevent air from getting in . Then he substituted a copper sphere for the cask , with the result that after he got most of the water out , the sphere collapsed , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He finally did succeed with heavier material in securing a partial vacuum and carried out experiments under varying air pressures . Some of his results were : " A clock in a vacuum can not be heard to strike ; a flame dies out in it ; a bird opens its bill wide , struggles for air , and dies ; fishes perish ; grapes can be preserved six months in vacuo . " Guericke then showed how great the push of the air is by 1 16 TIlE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE performing his famous experiment of the Magdeburg hemispheres , which were hollow metal shells about a foot in diameter . After putting the hemispheres together and exhausting the air in the hollow interior , he demonstrated before Emperor Ferdinand and the Diet of Germany in 1654 that it required the combined strength of sixteen horses , eight pulling on one hemisphere and eight on the other , to separate them . The hemispheres were held together only by the pressure of the air on the outside . This spectacular experiment occurred in the year in which Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a laboratory , and employed Robert Hooke as his assistant . Hooke was himself to become famous as a scientist , and we have already had occasion to mention his name in connection with the microscopic ? school of biologists and the publication of his " Micrographia . " This book appeared eleven years after he began work as Boyle 's assistant . Robert Boyle had followed with considerable interest the experiments on atmospheric behavior conducted by his contemporaries in Germany , Italy , and France ; and with the assistance of Hooke he determined to go further . To begin with , he perfected an air-pump on the plan of Guericke 's but much more efficient , which enabled him to experiment with ease at pressures both less and greater than that of free atmosphere . He then verified a number of Guericke 's results , showing that sound will not travel in a vacuum , that combustion can not proceed without air , and that without it animals , birds , and fish cease to live . He also demonstrated that , although sound does not travel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction which proved later to be of the utmost importance for the science of physics . He performed many other interesting experiments into which we can not go here . // The most important of Boyle 's discoveries was the formulation of the law which bears his name , the law indicating the relation of gas pressure to volume . By means of a series of carefully planned experiments he found that at a constant temperature the volume of a gas such as air is decreased in proportion as the pressure applied to it is increased , and vice versa . For example , if the pressure applied to a gas is doubled , its volume is decreased fifty per cent ; if it is cut in half , the volume is doubled , and so on . If Y is taken to mean volume and P pressure , the following equation expresses this relationship : P = ; , where K is a constant which remains fixed for a given gas but has different values for different gases . Expressed otherwise , the equation reads : PI/=K . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas is kept at a constant temperature . Later it was discovered by another physicist that if the pressure is kept uniform , a constant ratio is also found to exist between temperature and volume . As temperature increases , the volume expands in direct ratio , and vice versa . Both these laws are now known to hold only for ordinary temperatures and pressures . Boyle 's law has proved to be of supreme scientific importance , both for chemistry and physics . It has been found by experiment to apply not only to air , with which Boyle experimented , but to nearly all other gases . In Boyle 's day many things pertaining to gases were undiscovered . Air was the only one known , and this , as is now well understood , is itself a mixture of a number of them . There are , of course , also other gases not found in ordinary air . Boyle 's painstaking experiments brought universal recognition . They gave added meaning to the inductive method emphasized by Francis Bacon and helped prevent the swing toward Cartesianism and speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devoutly religious man , declined all the honors that a grateful contemporary world would heap upon him . Not that he failed to arouse opposition ? many hailed the results of his experiments as destructive of religion and as undermining the authority of the universities . Science , however , had become more widely known . Its benefits were being recognized . And the violent and destructive criticism of even a generation before had been greatly diminished . Boyle had a delicate constitution and during his later years was frequently ill , but his resources were plentiful and enabled him to live a protected life . He found great joy in his work . As he said , " In my laboratory , I find that water of Lethe which causes me to forget everything but the joy of making experiments . " With Boyle 's researches on atmospheric behavior following Galileo 's in mechanics , physical science received a tremendous forward impulse . Yet all this was but a harbinger of the truly revolutionary effects produced by the work of one of Boyle 's later contemporaries , the noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI PHYSICS ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENCE I IN reviewing the accomplishments of Newton , it should not be forgotten that we are still concerned with that remarkable period of development ( designated in these pages as the scientific renaissance ) which followed the pioneer work of Galileo , Kepler , Gilbert , and Harvey , and Bacon 's and Descartes 's appeal to the popular imagination in the interests of science . We come now , in fact , to the crowning achievement of that period . Nor should the effects of the renaissance in the fields we have just reviewed and the achievements of certain of Newton 's contemporaries , such as Robert Boyle , be overlooked in appraising what Newton wrought . Newton was not an isolated phenomenon . He came at a time ripe to receive him . What his immediate predecessors and his close contemporaries achieved in mathematics , astronomy , and physics , paved the way for his own brilliant accomplishments . It should likewise be remembered that Great Britain in the second half of the seventeenth century was in a better position to foster scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Holland independent thought flourished for a time ; but soon after the middle of the century the two nations clashed in mortal combat , and scientific interests were submerged . In the conflict Holland fell from power , France was weakened and humiliated , and England moved toward her political ascendancy . Germany had in the interim become , like Spain , Italy , and Austria , a country I19 // in which science could not advance except under severe han dicap . Great Britain alone remained tolerant and mighty . Besides the Englishman Boyle and his assistant Hooke , there were other celebrated scientists who in one way or another are associated with Newton and his work , such as Edmund Halley , the discoverer of the comet which bears his name . We can not even cursorily review the life of each one of this splendid galaxy without deviating too far from the main current of our theme . Yet there are two men , at least , who should be considered somewhat carefully because of the immediate bearing of their work on that of Newton . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of light , and Gottfried Leibnitz , whom we have already had occasion to mention in connection with his contributions to the metaphysical and psychological con troversies of the time . Since most of the latter part of this chapter will concern itself with Newton primarily , Leibnitz and I Iuygens will be briefly dealt with here . Leibnitz ( 1646-1716 ) was a most remarkable German philosopher and scientist , in that he made important con tributions to three widely separated scientific fields ? mathe matics , geology , and psychology . In geology he formed the link between Descartes and Laplace in the development of a notable theory concerning the evolution of the universe . Of his work in psychology we have already spoken , and of his achievements in mathematics more will be said presently . Leibnitz mastered Greek and Latin at an early age , later becoming a close student of Plato and Aristotle , whose views he endeavored to reconcile . At twenty , he had also mastered sufficient law to qualify for a law degree at the University of Leipsic in his native city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there , though he secured it elsewhere the same year . Four years later , in 167o , he was appointed to an important judicial office . In 1672 he PHYSICS ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENCE I2I visited Paris and London and became acquainted with Newton , Boyle , Huygens and other eminent scientists . He was then only twenty-six , yet his fame as a philosopher and scientist had already spread , and , during his stay in London , he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society . Later he organized scientific societies in various German cities and in St. Petersburg at the suggestion of Peter the Great of Russia , who bestowed a pension and title upon him . Leibnitz was honored , likewise , in other countries and especially in his native Germany . He was eminent in " history , divinity , philosophy , political studies , mathematics , mining , experimental science , and belles-lettres " ? a truly remarkable genius , a man whose life and works are well worth detailed study . Huygens ( 1629-1695 ) excelled as a mathematician , astronomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family of prominence , and inherited the title of Lord . His father was a celebrated Dutch writer , and his grandfather was secretary of the State Council . Huygens studied at the universities of Leyden and Breda , beginning ( like Leibnitz ) with law , but later turning to mathematics , which he soon mastered , publishing a book on the subject at the age of twenty-two . Branching out from mathematics , Huygens took up astronomy and physics , doing notable work in both these fields , especially with respect to the planet Saturn and its rings and with respect to theories of gravitation and light . His genius for mechanical invention attracted wide notice . He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society in England early in life and was associated with the Academy of Sciences in Paris for a number of years . Huygens was twenty-eight when in 1657 he went to Paris , then still one of the centers of liberal thought , to prosecute experiments on the pendulum initiated by Galileo . Here he T22 THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accurate determination of the force of the earth 's gravity , and worked out the principles of so-called centrifugal force , which is the force needed to keep a body moving in a circular or quasi-circular path . Newton was heavily indebted to Huygens for these splendid contributions when he came to determine the law of universal gravitation . At the age of fifty-two , Huygens returned to Holland from France and began the construction of enormous telescopes , one of which had a focal length of 210 feet . He spent some years on this work and on a study of optics and light . In 1690 appeared his " Treatise on Light , " one of his major achievements , in which his undulatory theory is set forth in detail . This book also contains an account of the polarization of light , a peculiar effect produced by certain substances such as tourmalin when light passes through them . Light striking such substances from all directions succeeds in getting through in only one " plane . " It is an interesting fact that polarization , which I Iuygens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he conceived it could not explain and which led Newton to reject it . Huygens thought of light traveling in longitudinal waves , as sound does . Experiments a century or more later proved that light travels in transverse waves , with which correction the undulatory theory explains polarization and is accepted to-day . Both Huygens and Leibnitz remained bachelors , as did Newton also . Thus the unusual endowments nature gave to these three geniuses of science presumably died with them . 2 Turning now to the early life of Sir Isaac Newton ( 1642-1727 ) , we note that he was born the year his great prePHYSICS // decessor Galileo died . Newton was a sickly child and gave every indication of a short life . He belied all expectations on this score , however , by living to the advanced age of eighty-five . We have said that Newton was not an isolated phenomenon . At the same time he towered head and shoulders above his contemporaries . His accomplishments in mathematics , astronomy , and physics have not been surpassed by any man . Than Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of one of her noblest sons . Newton 's father , who died before Isaac 's birth , had been a farmer , and various efforts were made to induce Isaac to devote himself to the cultivation of the soil . But the boy would have nothing of it . His mechanical inclinations had early become apparent . He made windmills , water-clocks , and other devices , and in a spirit of mischief is said to have tied lanterns to the tails , of kites , sending them up at night to delude his fellow-townsmen into thinking they were watching comets . Finding that Isaac would not be a farmer , his mother finally allowed him to be prepared for Trinity , one of the colleges of Cambridge University , which he entered at the age of eighteen . Hitherto Newton had had little opportunity for displaying his prodigious intellect ; but at college he soon outstripped all his classmates , finding the scheme of lectures too slow , and on the side mastering in rapid succession Euclid 's " Elements , " Kepler 's " Optics , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon he had devoured everything mathematical he could lay hands on and was engaging in frequent discussions with the professor of mathematics , Isaac Barrow , who recognized Newton 's remarkable ability and encouraged him as much as he could . Barrow was himself a most distinguished mathematician and must be given credit for much that Newton now undertook . With mathe124 THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE matics , he studied astronomy and physics , all of which took a strong grip on his imagination . Newton was twenty-two when Trinity in 1664 awarded him the A.B . degree . He intended to stay on , but a plague closed the institution , and he went home for eighteen months . ' When the college reopened , he returned as a fellow . In 1669 , after receiving his M.A. degree and upon the gracious resignation of Barrow in his favor , Newton was offered the chair of mathematics at his alma mater . This professorship he accepted and continued to hold for thirtyfour years . It is well to pause here , before completing our sketch of Newton 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man of twenty-seven as a professor in Cambridge University . These reasons will take us into the most revolutionary of his accomplishments in mathematics , astronomy , and physics ; for the years just preceding and following the taking of his A.B . degree were the prolific years of his remarkable career . During this early period , his most fertile work was begun and in some respects brought to completion . Newton had barely passed twentyone when he began making the experiments and formulating the hypotheses which have come down to us as the greatest scientific generalizations of all time . The plague years of ' 65 and ' 66 were not a calamity for Newton . They provided a great opportunity . For eighteen months he was able to reflect on various scientific problems undisturbed by routine study . He had time to digest the lessons learned at Trinity . He could go out into the open , watch the leaves and the fruit fall from the trees in his orchard , and at night look up at the starry heavens and wonder and dream . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days I was in the prime of my life for invenPHYSICS // tion , and minded mathematics and philosophy more than at any time since . " It was during the plague years that Newton experimented with his method of " fluxions , " now called the calculus , the application of which has revolutionized the entire science of mathematics . Building upon the new foundations laid by Descartes in his coordinate geometry , Newton introduced a mathematics of things in motion , whereas , before , mathematics had dealt mainly with things at rest . The Cartesian mathematical device had fascinated Newton , and we may well picture him in his undergraduate enthusiasm plotting curves to represent not only abstract algebraic relations but the practical equations of Kepler and Galileo embodying the laws of planetary motion and of falling bodies . Kepler 's third law , r3 = kt2 , and Galileo 's falling body law , d = klt2 , could be plotted . So could other practical relationships . But the whole procedure was still static . No dynamic element had been introduced . The revelation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fixity in plotted figures is unnecessary . Whatever credit should be given Leibnitz and other mathematicians of that period , especially to the Frenchman Fermat , who all but created the calculus in the preceding generation , the idea of motion and change was apparently not in their minds . They were more concerned with abstract mathematical technique , with drawing tangents to curves , with finding the lengths of curves , and with calculating areas inclosed by curves . It was Newton who seized upon the revolutionary conception of a mathematics of motion and applied it so successfully to practical problems . Newton asked himself : Why not regard the circle , for example , as generated by a point moving in the path of the curve ? Having raised the question , he proceeded to work // out ways and means for determining mathematically how fast , for a given curve , the point should be regarded as moving at one position as compared with others . The relative rate with which this imaginary point was presumed to move he designated the curve 's " fluxion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a falling body moving ? A cannon-ball , light , an electron , a planet ? Are they moving with uniform or variable speeds ? If variable , is there any way of calculating the speed , or rate of change of speed , at any given time ? These are the kinds of questions with which we are confronted in nature ; and a mathematics of motion , of rates of change of motion , furnishes a key with which the most important problems of physics can be unlocked . Without entering further into the intricacies of this conception , we can but repeat that important practical problems could now be readily solved by the new mathematical technique . Newton called it the method of fluxions , but it came to be known as the calculus , following the terminology used in the mathematical writings of Leibnitz , which proved the easier terminology to understand , although Newton 's was the more accurate . The invention of the calculus or method of fluxions marks a mile-stone in mathematics . It marks , also , an unpleasant controversy between its two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the plague in 1665 . He did not make it public until 1693 , , twenty-eight years later , although his manuscript had been circulated among friends as early as 1669 , and Leibnitz had seen it about 1676 . In 1684 Leibnitz published his theory of the calculus , nine years before Newton published his method of fluxions . Newton 's friends accused Leibnitz of taking the idea from Newton , and Leibnitz retaliated by accusing Newton of having plagiarized from him . It was a long and // painful dispute , the net result of which was that Leibnitz 's calculus , with much the better notation , came to be used almost exclusively on the Continent , while Newton 's more complicated method of fluxions was used in England . Because of the superior symbolism of the former , higher mathematics made tremendous strides outside of the British Isles , while in Newton 's own country little mathematical progress was made after his time for a considerable period . We appreciate now , in retrospect , that both Leibnitz and Newton should be given credit for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other or both from Fermat and Barrow , Newton furnished the philosophy of motion and rate of change which lies behind the calculus , and Leibnitz furnished the practical notation which has persisted to the present day . And , curiously enough , Newton is known as a practical scientist and Leibnitz as a theoretical philosopher ! So much for the part Newton played in the discovery and development of a new mathematical tool . We might stop to mention some of his further contributions to mathematics , such as his discovery of the binomial theorem while still an undergraduate at Trinity , but this would again take us too far afield . One other fact , however , deserves special emphasis here . Newton soon lost his fascination for mathematics as a thing in itself and came to regard it more and more as a practical tool for solving the problems of physics and astronomy . There were a number of noted mathematicians in his day , but none appreciated as he did the value of mathematical symbolism as a short-cut method of scientific reasoning , of compacting many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . Newton 's speculations regarding gravitation , the most profound and revolutionary of any before Einstein , were also begun during the two plague years of 1665-1666. // Galileo had demonstrated that a body falling to earth behaves in a certain way ; that is , its velocity is not uniform but increases directly as the time of falling ( v = kit ) , and its distance of fall increases as the square of the time ( d  --  -= 0-2 ) . Kepler had shown that planets move in elliptical orbits and that the cube of their mean distances from the sun varies as the square of their periodic times ( r3 = kt2 ) . These facts were turning themselves over in Newton 's mind , and he was wondering if there could be any relationship between them ? the same old wonder which has been at the basis of so many important discoveries . We all know the story of how the fall of an apple from a tree is supposed to have started him on this train of thought and to have raised the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same force that keeps the planets in their courses ? What a Dionysian thought this ! How it must have stirred him to the depths as he propounded it ! He determined to find the answer , and his law of universal gravitation is the sequel . The conceptions of force and gravity were not novel in Newton 's clay . Speculations on these subjects had come down from the ancient Greeks . The power or force which pulls things to earth was , generally speaking , well known . Galileo had worked out the laws of its behavior with respect to the earth , and in Newton 's own day Huygens had determined the quantitative extent of its pull at the earth 's surface ; but no one apparently had thought of it as reaching out into space and holding the planets in their courses . It was Newton who first conceived of gravitation as a universal force , applying not only to terrestrial affairs but to everything everywhere . The first problem he faced in attempting to reconcile Galileo 's and Kepler 's laws was to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight-line fall of the apple . The apple had previously been at rest on the appletree . If a planet had previously been at rest , back at the beginning of things , and obeyed the same law as the apple , it must surely have fallen into the sun after beginning to move , just as the apple falls to earth . But possibly the planet had not been at rest ? Possibly it had had an initial motion of its own ? Possibly rest is not the only natural condition of a body , as Aristotle had supposed ? For if the planet had had an initial motion , it might have been able to resist the straight-line pull of the sun 's gravity sufficiently to have avoided falling in , even though in the process it was made captive by the sun and doomed forever to circle around it . The assumption involved in the reasoning of the preceding paragraph is now known as Newton 's first law of motion and is , in brief , that every particle of matter in the universe is in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless acted upon by some outside force . By adding the italicized phrase " or of uniform motion in a straight line " to Aristotle 's hypothesis that " rest " is the only natural condition of bodies , Newton was able to explain both the straight-line fall of the apple and the elliptical orbits of the planets . Assuming that at the beginning the planets possessed a uniform motion in a straight line and that , as they were passing the sun , they were bent out of this course by the sun 's gravitational pull , Newton now set about demonstrating mathematically that their present elliptical orbits can be looked upon as an equilibrium of their assumed initial motion and the force of gravity of the sun . So much for Newton 's first assumption , as a corollary to which force came to be defined as anything which causes or tends to cause a change in the motion of a body . He had // resolved the straight-line fall of bodies to earth and the elliptical paths of the planets into one underlying formula , but other problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of gravitational force being applied in a given instance . So far as the earth is concerned , this had already been worked out by Galileo , who had proved two things : first , that the relation between the earth 's gravitational pull and the mass or density of a body it is attracting is a direct one ( F = kim ) ; and , second , that the velocity produced varies directly with the time of falling ( v= kit ) . Combining the ideas involved in these two equations , Newton enunciated his famous " force equals mass times acceleration " formula ( F=ma ) which is now spoken of as his second law of motion . Acceleration is the rate of change of the speed with which a body is moving ; that is , velocity divided by time , or a= t . From Galileo 's two equations we get F = m-my , and substituting we get Newton 's second law . The reader need not feel discouraged if the foregoing reasoning appears technical . Coming as an unfamiliar piece of deduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely clear ; and it must be remembered that it represents one of the most profound generalizations of all time . We have traced the carefully formulated deductions leading up to what are now generally considered as two inexorable laws of motion . Regarding the testing out of these laws we have still to speak . Before this could be accomplished , however , Newton found it necessary to lay down a third hypothesis . He was trying to work out a formula for a force of gravitation acting between any two bodies anywhere in space . Take , for example , the earth and the moon . Which way shall we consider the assumed gravitaPHYSICS // tional force between them to be acting , from the earth to the moon , from the moon to the earth , or in both directions ? Obviously the third alternative is free from difficulty . It is the one Newton chose , stating that " to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . " This is now called his third law of motion . Having cleared the situation with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into centrifugal force , Newton applied his hypotheses ( which , as we have seen , involve Galileo 's law of falling bodies ) to Kepler 's law of planetary motion , r-3 = kt2 . The outcome , concerning which we can not readily supply the proof here , was a curious mathematical result , namely , that , so far as a planet and the sun are concerned , the force of the assumed gravitational attraction between them varies directly as the product of their masses and inversely as the square of their distance apart , that is , F = KMm The numerator of the r right side of this equation is nothing strange . It is merely a restatement of Galileo 's findings that force varies with mass . The fact , however , that in measuring gravity the distance between bodies is the other important controlling factor , is the new and surprising situation disclosed by Newton 's final generalization , which has come to be known as his " inverse square law . " This generalization he now proceeded to try out . A suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pull of the earth upon a falling body at the earth 's surface , which is about 4000 miles from its center . Galileo and Huygens had worked this out . Now if the earth attracts an apple , it must , under Newton 's hypotheses , also attract the moon , which is kept from falling because of the resistance produced by an assumed initial motion of its own . The moon 's distance from the earth 's center had - 32 THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE already been estimated as about 240,000 miles , or sixty times the earth 's radius . Newton also knew the force actually keeping the moon in its orbit by the formula for centrifugal force worked out by Huygens . In brief , he knew the pull ( Fl ) of the earth 's gravity at its surface and the pull ( F2 ) keeping the moon in its orbit sixty times farther away . If his inverse-square assumption held , Fi should be equal to 3600 ( 602 ) times F2 . ( We omit the intervening mathematical computations . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately in 1666 , when Newton first worked on the problem , the earth 's radius had not been accurately measured , a fact not realized at the time . As a result , Newton 's deduction test ended in failure and keen disappointment , for with the incorrect figures Fl did not equal 3600 times ' 2 . his assumptions , he felt , were wrong . Sixteen years passed before a more accurate measurement of the earth 's radius was made . Newton was present when the findings were read to the Royal Society . Stirred to the depths , with his abandoned hopes of sixteen years before revived in fullest intensity , he hurried home to make the calculations with the corrected figures . So great was his agitation that he asked a friend to do the figuring for him . The results accorded fully with his inverse-square hypothesis . Newton 's deduction had become a great scientific generali-zation ! Even then Newton was for some reason reluctant to make his discovery public . It required the efforts of his friend Edmund Halley , the astronomer , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were finally published in 1686 in what is still regarded as the greatest single contribution to science , his epoch-making " Principia Philosophie . " // ? 3 Newton 's stupendous achievement with respect to gravitation had a revolutionary effect on all science , and especially upon astronomy and physics . In astronomy the result was not to put the subject upon a new basis , but rather to confirm the soundness of the foundation laid down by Kepler and Galileo and to hasten the abandonment of the false theory of vortices put forth by Descartes . Astronomical research took on a new impetus . On the one hand , men of great intellect were drawn into the work of applying Newton 's law to the remotest of astronomical observations and of verifying its accuracy . On the other hand , astronomy no longer continued to concern itself primarily with the plan of the solar system . Attention was drawn to other problems . In physics , the effect of Newton 's law of gravitation and its corollaries was decidedly revolutionary . Dynamics , the sub-science of things in motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the other branches of physics could develop along constructive scientific lines . For dynamics is fundamental to the rest of physics , just as physics itself is fundamental to other sciences . The basic character of dynamics was not appreciated in Newton 's day . It was not then realized that sound , heat , light , electricity , magnetism , all and each , can be reduced to various kinds of motion . Sound is now perceived as vibrations in the air striking the ear-drum ; heat as an agitation of the molecules of a body communicated to us through the sense of touch ; light , electricity , and magnetism as vibrations of differing frequencies in the so-called ether . Each of the sub-sciences dealing with these phenomena may now be said to have its own laws of motion , its dynamics ; but their developments are recent . In Newton 's day very little of these relationships was known , and what was worked out 13 . E THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE was due largely to his own achievements in sound and light , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motion and of gravitation placed physics on an unassailable scientific foundation . Newton 's herculean efforts sufficed to break the third Seal of Science . In what has just been said about the relation of dynamics to the rest of physics , we have once more an illustration of an important theme which permeates this essay ; namely , that there is a definite sequence to the unfoldment of the sciences . Without Greek mathematics , without Descartes 's additions in analytic geometry , and without the work of other able mathematicians who preceded Newton , the calculus as a tool for analyzing moving forces could not have come into being . Without the calculus and the other mathematical implements , and the laws of terrestrial and celestial motion worked out by Kepler and Galileo , the Newtonian substructure of physics could not have been laid ; and , in turn , without physics secure , other sciences could not have been put into place . That there is a well defined hierarchy to the sciences must now be regarded as an outstanding scientific fact . This does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next one can be established . But it does mean that the foundation-stones at least must have been laid before the following science can gain the necessary foothold to place it in turn upon a secure scientific basis . 4 Before returning to the chronological outline of Newton 's career , from which we turned aside to take up his contributions to mathematics and dynamics , begun and brought to almost full completion during the two plague years of ' 65 and ' 66 , we may profitably pause further to examine // another of his major endeavors begun about the same time , and continued as part of his teaching work when he succeeded Barrow as professor of mathematics at Trinity College . This was his work in optics and light . The nature of these physical phenomena had puzzled scientists from early times . Every physicist of note had grappled with them . Euclid had been a pioneer here , putting forth the idea that light , in coming from the celestial bodies to the earth , travels in straight lines . Ptolemy had gone further and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path in passing through various media , as air or glass . The crooked appearance of an oar in water , for instance , is due to the refraction of light in passing from the air into the water . Ptolemy had also noted that the direction of refraction is related to the angle of incidence , which is the angle at which the light-rays strike a medium before passing through . He had calculated how much must be allowed to correct the apparent displacement of a heavenly body from its real position as viewed from the earth . Without such corrections , astronomy would still be weltering in a maze of inaccuracies . During the Dark Ages the Arabs had advanced the study of light and optics somewhat ; but the next really important contributions are found in the " Opticks " of Roger Bacon , wherein he describes magnifying and burning glasses and illustrates diagrammatically how light is refracted and focused in passing through lenses of various designs . He , it will be recalled , also introduced the idea of spectacles to improve vision . With Galileo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his improved telescope . This was soon followed by the invention of a usable microscope , as we have already had occasion to mention in other connections . Kepler had improved on Ptolemy 's methods of calculating // angles of refraction and had paved the way for the later discovery of a definite relationship , for a given medium , between angle of incidence and angle of refraction . Descartes had also contributed to the subject . Then came the brilliant researches of Newton and Huygens . As early as 1664 , Newton began experiments at Trinity to determine the meaning of the so-called phenomenon of colors . That sunlight at times produces colored effects , as in the rainbow or in passing through prismatic glass , had been known for centuries , but no one had worked out the explanation . The result of Newton 's researches here was the startling realization that sunlight is not homogeneous but is a composition of seven main colors ? red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , and violet ? each with a different angle of refraction , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a prism . All these colors put together produce the white-light effect we get from sunlight . Applying his results to the refracting telescope , which had been giving color troubles , Newton concluded that this type would always encounter such difficulties and that for the best results a reflecting telescope should be used . Without going into the details of this fascinating field of scientific study , it must suffice to point out that Newton 's researches in light and optics paved the way for the giant reflecting telescopes now used in the world 's largest observatories and for the invention of the spectroscope , which opened another epoch in scientific development . The behavior and color composition of light is one thing . Its intrinsic nature is another . What is the character of this light which is refracted at different angles in passing through different media and which can be broken up into seven major colors in passing through a prism ? Is it something material ? Are particles or corpuscles sent through // space from the luminous source ? Or is it something immaterial , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were the next questions to which Newton addressed himself . He had already demonstrated conclusively that sound has no material existence and that it is the result of vibrations set up in the air , which , striking the ear-drum , cause us to experience the phenomenon called sound . Boyle and Guericke had helped prepare the way for this explanation by showing that in a vacuum , where there is no air , the ticking of a clock can not be heard . Newton was fifteen years younger than Boyle and thirteen years younger than Huygens . While Boyle was laughing out of court the notion that nature abhors a vacuum by actually producing one at will with his air-pump , Huygens was putting forth his bold assumption , in an effort to explain the nature of light , that even within a so-called vacuum , and in and through everything else , there is an allpervasive something which he called the " ether , " and upon which , he held , light travels in undulations or waves just as sound travels on air . This famous undulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one now generally held . It has to-day also received added significance through being used to explain electrical and magnetic phenomena . In Newton 's day , as already indicated , the fact that Huygens had conceived the undulations of light as longitudinal rather than transverse , and the fact that polarization can not be explained with the longitudinal hypothesis , presented an insurmountable obstacle to the acceptance of the theory . In opposing it , Newton substituted his corpuscular hypothesis , which held that light is composed of tiny particles emitted from the luminous source . Around these two conceptions a historic controversy raged , with Newton // on one side and Huygens on the other . Huygens defended his hypothesis most ably , but the weight of Newton 's authority , together with Huygens 's death in 1695 and the incorrect conception of the undulatory theory held at the time , turned the scales in Newton 's favor . The corpuscular theory came to have the preference until the beginning of the nineteenth century , when a conclusive experiment showed it to be untenable . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendliest of terms . Newton had only the highest words of praise for his older contemporary , to whose splendid work in mathematics and physics he himself owed much . Both men contributed prodigiously to the sci ence of physics . It is to be regretted that only the briefest mention of their achievements can be made in these pages . ? 5 When in 1669 Barrow resigned his chair of mathematics at Cambridge University in favor of young Newton , it was because the latter 's genius had already become fully ap parent to him . For the next eighteen years , Newton 's time was taken up with lectures and research and with the con troversies that arose . In 1687 , on the eve of the English Revolution , he became involved in a dispute between the crown and Cambridge University . The university had re-fused to comply with the king 's command in a certain mat-ter , and its vice-chancellor was adjudged in contempt . The part Newton played in the subsequent proceedings caused the crown to give way , and as a consequence Newton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warden of the Mint of England on terms which did not interfere with his university professorship . His scientific knowledge resulted in a transformation of the coinage of Great Britain // and in his elevation to the position of master of the Mint . This was in 1697 . His augmented duties , and the bitter con-troversy over his theory of fluxions in which he was em-broiled soon afterward , now became too much for him , so that in 1703 he resigned his professorship . The same year he was elected president of the Royal Society , and a short time later he was elevated to knighthood . Several years before , France had paid him the tribute of electing him as the first foreign associate of the Academy of Sciences . At the age of sixty-one Sir Isaac Newton is seen en-gaged in a routine of duties at the Mint , Parliament , and the court of England . He had become a great court favorite . Yet he had lost none of his interest in mathe-matics and physics . He was still a power of the first magni-tude'in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed , in which all the great mathematicians of the day took part . One authority would develop a troublesome problem and challenge his contemporaries to work it out . Newton always found a solution without apparent difficulty . On one occasion , the mathematician Jean Bernoulli propounded a most complicated problem which it took Leibnitz six months to fathom . It was then sent to New-ton , who solved it in twenty-four hours and published the answer anonymously . Bernoulli , recognizing the master 's handiwork , exclaimed on reading the solution , " Ex ungue leonem l " Just as the lion is known by his paw , so was the handiwork of Newton manifest . No finer tribute to his genius could have been given than this spontaneous ex-clamation from one of the premier mathematicians of the day . For twenty years more Newton 's great personal in-fluence continued to make itself felt , but finally the in-firmities of old age overtook him , and he died in his // eighty-fifth year . Many glowing tributes were paid to his memory , among which Playfair 's eulogy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To his important inventions in pure mathematics Newton added the greatest discoveries in the philosophy of nature ; and , in passing through his hands , mechanics , optics , and astronomy were not merely improved but renovated . No one ever left knowledge in a state so different from that in which he found it . Men were instructed not only in new truths , but in new methods of discovering truth ; they were made acquainted with the great principle which connects together the most distant regions of space , as well as the most remote periods of duration , and which was to lead to future discoveries , far beyond what the wisest or most sanguine could anticipate . Shortly before his death , Newton himself wrote , in a characteristically modest vein : I know not what the world will think of my labors , but to , myself it seems that I have been hut as a child playing on the sea-shore ; now finding some prettier pebble or more beautiful shell than my companions , while the unbounded ocean of truth lay undiscovered before me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay beyond ; yet Newton more than any other one man provided the chart and compass for its successful navigation . ? 6 What the scientific renaissance of the seventeenth century accomplished may now be briefly summarized . ( r ) It was ushered in by the establishment of astronomy as a science and the breakdown of the authority of the written word . Galileo , Kepler , Gilbert , and Harvey are the prominent figures here . ( 2 ) Science and its methods became widely known PHYSICS ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENCE ' 4 ' through the poignant writings of Francis Bacon and Rene Descartes . Direct observation of nature and careful experiment took on a scope theretofore undreamed of . And just as happened on a smaller scale in Aristotle 's day , speculative theories , once the rebirth of scientific interest came , were advanced on every hand regardless of whether they were carefully considered or not . The methods of science became more fully understood , but that there is a sequence to the unfolding of scientific knowledge no one as yet surmised . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics had to precede the founding of chemistry as a science , that an understanding of chemical principles had to come before geology and biology could be securely established , and that biology in turn is fundamental to psychology . It was only natural , therefore , that many false theories should be advanced to account for chemical , geological , biological , and psychological phenomena , at the same time that the substructure of physics ( the next in the sequence after mathematics and astronomy ) was being completed . Anti , of course , the new false theories had to be broken down later just as the false theories of the ancients were , except that the process had become easier because of the wider adherence to the inductive method . ( 3 ) At the high-water mark of the period physics was placed on a solid basis at the hands of the incomparable Newton and his co-workers . The stupendous sweep of this achievement has just been indicated . In addition to these major accomplishments , the groundwork was being prepared by Boyle and others for the subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant researches of men like Malpighi were opening up a new era for nature study , so that after further assistance from physics and chemistry , the sciences of geology and biology could perfect their structures ; and the relationship // between psychology and metaphysics was being elucidated , the resultant discussion continuing in a highly speculative way until ( the physiology and anatomy of the brain and nervous system made clear by biological advance ) the foundation-stones of modern psychology could finally be laid down . CHAPTER VII EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY SCIENCE : THE .. RISE OF CHEMISTRY NEWTON 'S achievements , as has been intimated , produced an upheaval in the scientific world . His discoveries were so far-reaching and the controversies engendered so embittering that the result was frenzied activity in some quarters , almost complete stagnation in others . For the greater part of the eighteenth century , science was endeavoring to grasp and digest the meaning of his accomplishments . The eighteenth century also witnessed social and political changes of significance , though the tactics used in these fields continued to be those of the primitive savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century opened Spain and Holland had risen to positions of political eminence and fallen from them again , and England was displacing France as first among the nations . Sweden had secured a controlling position in the North ; but Russia now emerged from obscurity , under the leadership of Peter the Great , and before the first quarter of the century had passed had forced Sweden to surrender a considerable part of her possessions . Several decades later another power rose to ascendancy in Europe , Protestant Prussia , which , assisted by England , succeeded after a seven years ' war in repulsing both Catholic Austria and royalist France . England , politically and religiously free , was now supreme on the seas , had wrested North America from France , and had extended her influence to India . 143 // But England was to lose her American colonies , who could not quite swallow the idea of paying for the mothercountry 's foreign wars and who declared themselves free and independent in 1776 under a form of government which dispensed with kings and nobles entirely .

In 1789 the new spirit burst its bonds , and France , in the course of a bloody revolution , renounced her kings and became a republic . At the same time autocracy in Prussia , Austria , and Russia strengthened itself at the expense of prostrate Poland , which was dismembered till it ceased to exist . The kings of Europe had risen to supreme power as the papacy declined . They had had their own way for a considerable period , and France under Louis XIV ( 1643-1715 ) had been the complete embodiment of monarchy by divine right . But this king and his successors disgraced absolute monarchy irretrievably and permitted proud France to be mortified . The day of reckoning came in the Revolution of 1789 . In alarm , the kings and princes now flew to arms and began a concerted campaign against the French republicans " for the safety of their crowns . " Harassed by enemies on every side , France nevertheless held her own and as the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian , and other invaders but under young Napoleon had conquered Italy . Immediately afterward she concluded a peace ( 1802 ) which actually forced the nobles of Europe to recognize the political supremacy of the Republic in Continental affairs . Had Napoleon only stopped there ! But the temptation was too great . His ambition to wear a crown and to lord it over Europe were soon to prove his undoing and to hurl France once more into the eager arms of monarchy . // Politically , Europe continued , as she still to a considerable extent continues , to play the game of duplicity and brute force , with the lives of human beings as her pawns . In science , only one spirit had been manifest from the beginning , the fearless , unbiased search for truth that knows neither race nor creed . While in the one arena eighteenthcentury Europe continued her intrigues and bloodshed , in the other arena augmented facilities for publication and the multiplication of scientific societies were providing for a rapid interchange of ideas and enabling scientists to keep in touch with progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court and church finally came to regard scientists with indulgence and even respect , unless the scientists carried their convictions directly into politics or ecclesiastical affairs . This was a decided advance over the intolerance and opposition of the Galilean period . The scientific upheaval following Newton made itself felt first in mathematics , astronomy , and physics , and toward the end of the century in the transformation of chemistry into a science . As the period closed , like waters gathering force from many tributaries previously shut off from the main stream but finally breaking through the obstacles , a great river of scientific activity burst upon the world with inundating force , bringing in its wake a tremendous fertility of discovery . 2 The historic controversy between Newton and Leibnitz over the calculus , and the relative freedom from social and political disturbance in England , isolated that country during the eighteenth century from the mathematical activity of the Continent , where the more effective calculus notation of Leibnitz was uniformly followed . Despite important English achievements that might be mentioned , especially // those of Maclaurin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose work was characterized by the great Lagrange as " comparable with the finest and most ingenious work of Archimedes , " the outstanding mathematical advances of the period were made on the Continent . In Switzerland , the Bernoullis , a family of gifted mathematicians and teachers , trained their pupils thoroughly in the Leibnitzian technique . At the same time the Frenchmen Clairaut and d'Alembert developed so-called differential equations as an outgrowth of the calculus and applied them to a more accurate determination of the motions of the moon , to the variation in the earth 's gravity due to its ellipsoidal rather than completely spherical shape , and to the principles of wave motion as produced by sound and other physical phenomena . Outstanding among the Continental mathematicians of the second half of the eighteenth century were Euler , Lagrange , and Laplace . Leonhard Euler ( 1707-1783 ) , a pupil of the Bernoullis , recast the whole science of mathematics in his excellent treatises , did notable work in formulating equations to represent troublesome problems in the motions of rigid bodies and of fluids , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Clairault had struggled and for which Newton had done the spadework . Euler 's industry was prodigious , despite failing eyesight which ultimately led to total blindness . The present mold into which college texts on algebra , analytical geometry , and the calculus are cast had its origin very largely in his penetrating and clarifying activity . Joseph Louis Lagrange ( 1736-1813 ) , introduced to mathematics at the age of nineteen , solved within two years thereafter a problem in the calculus that had been in dispute for half a century . Such was his genius . At twenty-five he // had hardly a rival , and during the next fifty years there was no phase of pure and applied mathematics on which he did not leave an impress and which he did not enrich . He had an unusual facility of expression and a unique power of analysis , as a reading of his " Mecanique Analytique , " one of the landmarks in mathematical progress , will serve to demonstrate . $ Pierre Simon Laplace ( 1749-1827 ) , the third of this able trio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solving physical , astronomical , and geological problems . He founded the modern school of mathematical physicists , worked out some of the more important of the principles governing the motions of the moon and other satellites , and was the first to give a clear scientific explanation of the origin of the solar system . His famous nebular hypothesis , that the planets were thrown off by the sun out of a primordial nebula and under a contraction produced by the force of gravity , held the field completely for more than a century and though now somewhat modified still holds the field to-day . His " Mecanique Celeste " ' is a landmark not only in mathematics but in astronomy and geology as well . Thus , throughout the eighteenth century and beyond , the new world , opened up to mathematical analysis by the invention of the calculus , came to be explored by intellectual giants of the first order . It is not within the province of this book to develop the technical details of their exploratory effort . Suffice it to say that no present-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of higher mathematical analysis can fail to appreciate the revolutionary effect of the labors of the men we have so very casually just reviewed , upon all branches of scientific inquiry from their day onward , and especially upon progress in the fields of astronomy , physics , and chemistry . // ? 3 In turning to further eighteenth-century advances in astronomy , it is well to recall once more that the foundations for this science had been laid down by Kepler and Galileo before the advent of Newton . Kepler had discovered the three laws of planetary motion and had done notable work on astronomical tables , on the behavior of comets , and on the sun 's motions . Galileo had perfected the first usable telescope , had pointed out that the moon has mountains and valleys and that the sun has spots , had indicated that the planet Jupiter is attended by several moons , and in general had disproved the deeply rooted cosmographical prejudices of his age . Newton , in addition to his momentous cosmographical and physical generalizations , had explained the ocean tides as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had proved that the earth is not a perfect sphere but an ellipsoid , and had clarified a number of other astronomical observations previously a puzzle . After Newton , the famous observatories at Greenwich and Paris were built and the modern era of astronomical progress began . With the acceptance of Newton 's results , astronomy , as has already been intimated , received a new impulse in two directions : one , in applying his gravitational law to the remotest and minutest of astronomical observations to verify its complete accuracy ; the other , in opening up the study of new problems , the plan of the solar system now coming to be regarded as completed . With both these developments the name of William Herschel is intimately connected . Other notable names are also closely associated with the astronomical advances of this period , and these will be mentioned presently , but Herschel symbolized the postTHE // Newtonian astronomical spirit so well that his life and work merit more than casual consideration here . Frederick William Herschel ( 1738-1812 ) was a musician and the son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had owned a small telescope , through which William scanned the heavens . The boy 's first view of the night sky " set the current of his life and fired him with the ambition to look farther into space than ever human being did before him . " This ambition he realized . All the education given William was musical . The theory of music , however , involves a study of mathematics ; and for an ambitious young man it was an easy step from this point to optics and astronomy . At the age of thirty-four , in 1772 , we find him in England , whither he had emigrated from his home in Germany . He was supporting himself in his profession . With him resided a younger brother , also a musician , and a sister Caroline , who had come there ostensibly to study music , but who ' soon found that she was being trained to help her older brother in his astronomical work . Herschel quickly recognized the advantages of the Newtonian reflector over the Galilean refracting telescope . With the reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall upon a concave mirror and are then reflected and focused in a convenient way for observation . The important part is the mirror . As the price of a good one was beyond I-Ierschel 's means , he decided to become his own optician . Both he and his brother possessed good mechanical skill , so that together , during a dull musical season , they set to work converting their drawing-room into a carpenter shop and , much to the dismay of Caroline , who was the acme of neatness , and who was keeping house for the three , installed a lathe in one of the bedrooms . Caroline soon caught t co THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE the scientific spirit , however , and became a most valuable astronomical assistant . After some two hundred partially successful attempts , the Herschels perfected a magnificent reflector . The story of their perseverance in the painstaking work of polishing mirrors , requiring most tedious and sustained effort , forms a scientific classic which is well worth the reading . During a period of sixteen hours , on one occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was polishing . After six years of such experience , rushing home after a brilliant musical performance to the monotonous grinding and polishing of reflectors , he was able to produce a telescope that was the equal of any ever made . Long before this he had at intervals scanned the heavens with the less perfect instruments he had completed . In 1775 he checked up on every known star in the skies . His experience in this survey served chiefly to convince him that he needed a still better reflector . By 1781 he had made something like 430 mirrors of gradually increasing size . It was during this year , in making a second review of the heavens with his largest reflector , that his attention was attracted by a new star , one that had never before been catalogued . He noted its position at various times and thought it behaved like a planet . He cautiously described it as a comet ; but the scientific world was quick to appreciate the value of his discovery , whether comet or planet , and he was forthwith elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Copley medal . Lexell of St. Petersburg later proved that Herschel had truly discovered a new planet , about nineteen times as far from the sun as the earth is , and in due time it was named Uranus . This was the first addition to the sun 's planetary family since the ancient Greek period . It was soon observed that the movements of Uranus did // not seem to conform to Newton 's law . This apparent discrepancy was not explained till the middle of the next century , when two astronomers , one in England and one in France , simultaneously calculated that the discordance must be due to the gravitational pull of still another planet , and successfully predicted where the new planet would be found . Thus Neptune was discovered in 1846 on the first night a search was made for it , and Newton 's law was once more vindicated , this time in a most spectacular way . During the eighteenth century a host of astronomers were engaged in testing out Newton 's generalizations . Nor did the motions of Uranus furnish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not seem to conform were certain irregularities presented in the motions of the moon , which have only recently been satis factorily cleared up in accordance with Newton 's laws , and // certain fluctuations in the orbital movement of the planet Mercury , which no recourse to Newton 's equations could seemingly elucidate , and which remained unexplained until Einstein provided a new formula . Turning from the testing of Newton 's laws to the special astronomical problems that were attacked after his time , we find that one of the most important has been to discover what motion , if any , the so-called fixed stars have . Here , again , Herschel did notable work . So did his older contemporary , James Bradley , who succeeded Edmund Halley as astronomer royal of England , and who in 1755 constructed a star-catalogue , by far the most accurate up to his time . Twenty centuries before Bradley , Hipparchus of Alexandria had constructed the best previous catalogue of the stars . It took the upheaval following Newton to produce something better ; and before any seeming motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate plotting of their positions had to be carried out . In 1718 1Ialley had carefully catalogued the southern stars and had noted apparent motions in several of them . About the middle of the century , Bradley at Oxford and Mayer at Gottingen suggested that these seeming motions might be due to a movement of the sun itself . Herschel followed up these suggestions , after his discovery of Uranus , and concluded that the whole solar system , the sun and all its planets , is moving as a unit in the direction of the constellation Hercules . Later researches confirmed Herschel 's conclusion and indicated that the speed with which the solar system is thus moving is about seven hundred miles an hour . More recent experiments , conducted by Professor Miller on Mount Wilson in 1925 , seem to suggest that this velocity is nearer seventy-five hundred miles an hour and that the direction is slightly different // from that found by Herschel ; but Miller 's experiments will need further verification before they can be generally accepted . Closely related to the seeming motions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Phis problem has engaged the attention of astronomers of every age . So soon as it had become apparent that the sun is not intrinsically different from the rest of the heavenly bodies , the great distances of these from the earth , in comparison with the sun 's distance , came to be vaguely appreciated . Yet no one had any conception of the incredible distances of the stars in space until relatively recent times . Stellar distances are now measured in " light-years . ' Figure it out ! Light travels 186,000 miles a second . How far does it travel in a minute , in an hour , in a day , in a week , and finally in a year ? The last of these is the staggering and incomprehensible distance covered by the term " light-year . " And twenty light-years away from the earth is an ordinary star distance ! Some stars are Ioo , 000 light-years away . To measure stellar distances requires instruments of great precision , and such instruments were not in existence in Herschel 's day . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , products of the physics of the next century , that the necessary accuracy was obtained . Bradley , the most accurate observer up to his time , had tried unsuccessfully to measure star distance with the instruments then available , and in his attempt had made an unexpected and important discovery . Ile had detected the so-called aberration of light , which is a phenomenon occasioned by the movement of the earth through space , and which seemingly displaces the stars from their true positions . This is quite apart from the displacements caused by refraction . Herschel also made an unsuccessful effort to measure // stellar distance and likewise hit instead upon a discovery of importance . He had chosen two stars close together , one brighter than the other , as a basis for his observations , little thinking that they were in any way related . On examining them closely he noticed to his astonishment that one revolved about the other . Observations of other sets yielded the same results , and subsequently thousands of such pairs of binary stars have been located . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gravitational law . They revolve one about the other as a result of their mutual attractions . Herschel 's early observations , as has been indicated , were made under great handicaps . He gained his livelihood as a musician , and he was eminently successful in his profession ; but his heart was elsewhere . It was not till after his discovery of Uranus that he was able to devote himself undividedly to the study he loved . When his achievement was brought to the attention of the king of England , the post of astronomer royal was offered him , together with a grant of the equivalent of ten thousand dollars for the construction of a giant telescope . Ierschel eagerly accepted , despite the fact that his income was at first much smaller than it had been during his musical career . He was now completely satisfied . With undivided attention and improved instruments , he kept steadily on with his researches . He catalogued eight hundred double stars and two thousand nebulae ! In 1788 , at the age of fifty , Herschel married ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also became a famous astronomer . Nor was the work of Herschel 's sister Caroline in vain . She herself discovered eight comets and was awarded the Royal Astronomical Society medal when seventy-five years old . The romance of the Herschels provides fascinating as well as instructive reading . Nowhere , posTHE // sibly , can one get the spirit of eighteenth-century science better than in a study of their lives and work . ' With the century 's close , Newton 's inverse-square law had been generally accepted by astronomers , and the special problems of astronomy had been more or less clearly delineated . Besides the study of stellar motions and distances , which had led to more accurate star-catalogues and to the discovery of binary systems of stars , of the aberration of light , and of the solar system 's motion through space , other problems , such as the origin of the solar system , the more careful examination ' of the sun and its spots , and the determination of the size and chemical constitution of the stars , had also been launched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ await newer instruments , which the sciences of physics and chemistry forged in the nineteenth century . Regarding Laplace 's theory of the origin of the solar system , more will be said in the following chapter when eighteenth-century advances in geology are discussed . ? 4 In physics , the chief concern of the century consisted in a further testing of Newton 's laws as applied to such fields as electricity and magnetism . At the same time , important progress was made in clearing away a false theory having to do with so-called imponderables , which to a large extent was enmeshing the whole subject in misconception . It was not , however , until after the beginning of the nineteenth century that this theory suffered a complete collapse and the way was opened for a rapid advance in physics . In Newton 's day there were a number of imponderables , ? figments of the imagination manufactured to explain certain physical phenomena . Newton himself added to the list , in his " corpuscle " of light . Besides this , the " caloric " imponderable was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated and lost when cooled ; the " phlogiston " imponderable , something a body gave off when burning ; and the " effluvia " imponderable , something that occasioned the behavior of electricity . In light and optics , the acceptance of the imponderable theory created so many obstacles to progressive research that for a time after Newton almost complete stagnation resulted . It was not until two noted physicists at the beginning of the nineteenth century took up their cudgels for Huygens 's wave theory , and scrapped the idea of light corpuscles , that the difficulties melted away and a real advance took place . A similar situation developed regarding heat . The theory that caloric is taken on and given off when a body is heated and cooled , and that phlogiston is lost when a body burns , originated in the seventeenth century . Various fantastic suppositions as to the properties of caloric and phlogiston were put forth , until the whole subject of heat was almost hopelessly entangled . Galileo , Francis Bacon , and Boyle had suggested that heat might be a mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took these suggestions seriously . Heat was generally regarded as a material substance , and so was fire . It remained for a most remarkable American soldier of fortune , Count Rumford ( 1753-1814 ) , to advance the subject further . Born under the name of Benjamin Thompson in Woburn , Massachusetts , this early American became eminent not only as a scientist but also as exemplifying in a very practical way the brotherhood of all men . Virtually forced into the ranks of the Royalists during the Revolutionary period because of the jealousy of fellow-officers in the colonial militia , who resented being outranked by a mere lad , he left for Europe , after receiving his scientific training , and rose rapidly to prominence in the scientific , // social , military , and political life of three nations . In England he became under-secretary of state , founded the Royal Institution of London , and was elevated to knighthood . In Germany he was created Count Rumford , and served as privy councilor , chief of police , and minister of war . He so revolutionized social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner and a Protestant in a Catholic community , the poor of the city spontaneously-turned out in a body to offer up public prayers for his recovery during a serious illness . In France he married the widow of the distinguished French chemist Lavoisier and became a close friend of Napoleon . By this time the czar of Russia was urging him to make his home in St. Petersburg and President Adams was offering him the posts of superintendent of the Military Academy and inspector-general of the artillery . Rumford never lost his love for his native land , despite the jealousies that had driven him from her shores . He left his fortune to Harvard , where under'privation and difficulty he had received his training in science . It would seem that such an active career as Count Rumford 's would leave little room for scientific pursuits . And yet his whole mature activity represented a colossal experiment in science . Whether in his project to survey the White Mountains , which never materialized , or in his work in the army , where he experimented upon the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in his introduction of improved methods of horse breeding , or in his social experiments of one kind and another , every new experience seemed to present to him an additional opportunity for research and experimentation . The whole world was Rumford 's laboratory . But we must return to the eighteenth-century progress in physics . While engaged in boring cannon at a military workshop in Bavaria in 1798 , Rumford began to suspect I . K8 THE SEVEN SEALS OF SCIENCE that heat has no material existence ; whereupon he decided to put the caloric theory to a test . A body taking on heat should gain in caloric . Rumford weighed the cannon and the boring tool before and after the borings , at which an enormous quantity of heat had been generated , but there was neither loss nor gain in weight . Apparently caloric did not weigh anything . He tried to " exhaust " the caloric by continuing the boring operations for a considerable period of time ; but he simply got more and more heat , which would seem to indicate that caloric was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that the heat did not come from the air , with no variation in the results . Finally he arranged a contrivance for drilling into a piece of brass under water , and by means of the heat produced in the boring operation , much to the surprise of the bystanders , brought the water to the boiling-point . His conclusion was that heat is caused by the friction of one body against another and that caloric is a meaningless and gratuitous assumption . By this time the chemists had demonstrated that phlogiston is likewise meaningless . Rumford felt persuaded that he would live to see " caloric interred with phlogiston in the same tomb . " A co-worker of his , Sir Humphry Davy ( 1778-1829 ) , continued these experiments at the Royal Institution . Davy introduced two pieces of ice into the receiver of an airpump , the interior of which was then exhausted to produce a vacuum ; and , keeping the whole apparatus at a temperature below freezing , he caused one piece of ice to be rubbed against the other . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rubbing ; and since the possibility that the heat came from either the material itself or from the surrounding medium had been rigidly excluded by the very nature of the experiment , Davy also came to Rumford 's conclusion . As he expressed it , " Friction // causes vibration of the corpuscles of bodies , and this vibration is heat . " These conclusive experiments , and a strong attack on the imponderable theories by another noted scientist at about the same time , should have been sufficient to mark the obsequies of caloric . It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century , however , that the interment which Rumford expected to witness actually took place . Davy was eminent not only as a physicist but also as a chemist , and his inspiring lectures at the Royal Institution attracted wide attention . It was he who discovered that nitrous oxide , popularly called laughing-gas , can be used to produce anesthesia ; and his experiments in electrolysis and other branches of electrochemistry , as we shall have occasion to amplify later , were of even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc , so important for lighting purposes to-day , and invented the miner 's safetylamp , the importance of which in preventing disasters from underground explosions can hardly be overestimated . Davy and Rumford were among the most brilliant and picturesque of the notable figures who throughout the ages have advanced the cause of science . Despite reliance upon the imponderable effluvia in ? connection with the study of electricity and magnetism , considerable eighteenth-century advance is to be recorded in these fields . So rapid was progress here , in fact , that effluvia was consigned to its last resting-place in the limbo of discarded theories before the century closed . It will be recalled that William Gilbert , at about the beginning of the seventeenth century , did the pioneer work in these branches of physical science . He was the first to draw a sharp distinction between electrical and magnetic phenomena , and it was he who cleared away the weird notions clustering about them before his time , even though he invented effluvia as a sub-            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
