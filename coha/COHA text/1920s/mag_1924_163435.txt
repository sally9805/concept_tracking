Waldo Selden Pratt , musical editor of the Century Dictionary , has brought out a 1,000-page New Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians* . This book was originally planned as a one-volume abridgment of Grove 's famed six-volume Dictionary of Music and Musicians . But to condense 6,000 pages into 1,000 was found to be impracticable . Therefore , a fresh scheme was worked out . The result is fortunate . The new encyclopedia is divided into : Part One , technical definitions and descriptions ; Part Two , biographies of persons connected with music since the year 1770-with an appendix including persons before 1770 ; Part Three , places , musical institutions and organizations . <P> Parts One and Two are necessarily brief and compact . But Part Three is a unique and happy experiment . Here are listed about 235 places , together with the various musical enterprises connected with them-a sort of musical geography wherein is to be found much matter not available in any other single place . <P> The book , well printed , is supplied with 16 plates by way of illustration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all musicians who might have been honored by the inclusion of their portraits , just these six should have been shown : Leopold Auer , Percy Goetschius , d'lndy , Hugo Reimann , Sibelius , Vaughan Williams . But this is a minor criticism , and does not affect the undoubted value of the work as a whole . <P> *Macmillan ( $6.00 ) .
