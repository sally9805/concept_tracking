Trading in election futures was brisk , last week , on the Royal Exchange . Such trading , Englishmen like to think , is not " betting on the election . " Certainly the thing is done in London with a flair and a nice decorum equaled nowhere else on earth . Indeed most U. S. citizens would find themselves flabbergasted if asked to devise the machinery for placing bets on an election which has so many queer features ( General Parliamentary Election , TIME , Nov. 10 , 1924 ) . <P> First off , no one knew , last week , exactly on what day or in what week or even during which month the British General Parliamentary Election would be held . As leader of the party in power ( Conservative ) , placid Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin could and would send all Great Britain scrambling to the ballot box at whatever time his advisers deemed least favorable to the rival parties ( Laborite &; Liberal ) . He might spring a " surprise election " in early May , or dawdle along until late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast their ballots within the legal period of five years after the present House of Commons was elected ( Oct. 29 , 1924 ) , good Squire Baldwin has as much liberty of choice as a Dowager Duchess deciding in July which hymns her servitors will sing at Christmas . <P> Secondly , it might seem impossible to devise a satisfactory way of betting on the British General Election as a whole , because the result may leave any one of the three parties or any two of them in power . Theoretically , should a roughly equal number of seats be won by each of the three parties , then after the election there might be formed any one of three different **31;6318;TOOLONG , Liberal-Laborite , or Conservative-Laborite-to carry on the Government . The King-Emperor would be obliged ( by custom ) to bestow the supreme political office of Prime Minister on any man designated by any party or coalition able to control a majority of votes in the House . Upon such seeming quicksands as these how shall one even lay the lightest bet ? <P> Absurdly simple ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Royal Exchange itself . Ignoring that justly celebrated mural Phoenicians Bartering with the Ancient Britons in Cornwall , one presses straight on and finds a board where election futures were quoted , last week . <P> thus : <P> <P> BOUGHT SOLD <P> CONSERVATIVES 274 270 <P> LIBERALS 84 80 <P> LABORITES 264 260 <P> Suppose that one considered 84 an attractive buy in Liberals . Then by having one 's broker " place " 1 ( $4.86 ) at that figure one would get exactly one 's money back if the Liberals win 84 seats , and would receive an additional pound for every seat they win above that number . Inversely , if one sells Liberals at 80 , and if only 70 candidates of that party are returned to the House , one pockets a crisp " tenner " ( $48.60 ) . To guess wrong in either buying or selling is to lose a pound a seat .
