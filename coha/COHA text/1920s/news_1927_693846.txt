The murderer escaped , but twenty detectives and many uniformed policemen were hunting late last night and early today for a " tall young man " who was said to have tried to lure several young girls of the neighborhood into dark hallways and alleys .

He did not knots of anybody who might have committed the murder . Inasmuch as the crime apparently was not committed until shortly before the girl was found dying about 10 o'clock at night , the police think that her murderer took her to a moving-picture show before inducing her to accompany him to the rooftop , where he killed her . When the girl was found she wore a small chain with a heart-shaped locket around her neck . The locket bore the initials " D. C ..

A woman who was standing at the front entrance of 1,013 Simpson Street about the time of the murder told the police that she did not see anybody enter or leave the house for some time except Castleman. so it is possible that the man not only escaped over the roofs , but took the girl up to the rooftop through some other house than that atop which he killed the child .
