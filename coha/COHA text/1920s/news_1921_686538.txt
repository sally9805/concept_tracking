txt France is undergoing great temptation ; the tempts ? tion to paper money inflation . Travellers from over tht Rhine bring stories of blazing factory chimneys and fut employment in Germany ; of feasting and dancing ; of big exports and mounting credits in world commerce ; of rig ? ing prices on the Berlin Bourse and taxes only half at much as in France . And back of it all a government print ing press that balances the budget with newly-made paper marks and by the same tokens covers the raill'oad deficit and keeps down the price of food . THE CONTRAST France , the victor in a world war that crushed her richest provinces , struggling in poverty to pay her debts of defence ; Russia , her former ally and the states of southeastern Europe , that taxed her faith and credit , now holding all the other ruined lands of earth ; unemployment in France increasing and cost of living still high ; not one mark from Germany of the twelve billion in gold due May 1 , payment of which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt finance , the serpent of socialism , the satan of repudiation , all whisper in the ear of France alluring strains of paper money inflation . The law says , No . The Bank of France says , No . Haute finance says , No . But clamorous creditors- say : " Take off the law that limits the paper franc issue and give us our money . " Others say : " Why suffer more ? Let our children pay or scaler Still others clamor : " It is true our franc now measures but a third in gold . Yet so did our Brother Jonathan 's greenback 50 years ago and it came back . Give us money or we perish . Look at - Germany ; prosperous with her paper mark worth in gold less than one-quarter our franc instead of 25% more . See how she undersells the world and exports ; buys cotton and wool and copper , manufactures and sells at a profit and pays everybody but us . " WHO IS CHEATING ? Time must give the answer . France is not a cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worth a cent and a half , or ten cents in gold , where she formerly paid them one gold . mark or 24c . We must now talk in cents because the U. S. Dollar and its silver coinage and its copper cent alone uphold the gold standard for the whole world . Can Germany for **26;146;TOOLONG exporting the ' products of labor on a wage basis 409k of the pre-war standard ! THE . GERMAN ORGANIZATION A country so highly organized industrially as Germany and with its workers so highly trained under civil and military discipline can for a considerable time force // EUROPEAN UNSETTLEMENTS billions of paper into circulation , especially under a unified credit system and government control of transport , rents , housing and food prices . Germany 's unified organization is also buttressed by ' credits with the outside world which the war failed to dislodge . Germany did not ' put her money into Russia or the Balkans . She knew . better . She meantthe destruction of both . She placed her money in Spain and in the Americas and it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or securities , be returned to the country through the allies ' blockade . This is the beginning and the fundamental of her financial strength today . She is financially powerful in Spain and South America and not without friends in North America . French investments went eastward and German investments went westward before the war . BUTTRESSING THE ALLIES During the war , England could borrow all the foreign investments of her subjects and pledge and sell them in the United States and elsewhere to maintain her war credits and her gold standard throughout the world . The ten billions of dollars borrowed by the allies from the United States maintained the gold standard of the pound sterling and the French franc to the end of the war . It is doubtful if Great Britain or France , without this assistance , could have maintained their purchasing power of war supplies . Let anyone who wishes to consider the part played by the United States in the war reflect for a moment what would have been the purchasing power in 1917 and 1918 had the pound sterling and the franc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were following the war with American credit withdrawn . All three nations have to date put into the war substantially the same amount of money , $ ? 0,000,000,000 . It should not be forgotten that it costs today twenty times as much to maintain an American soldier on the Rhine as a French soldier . Indeed , the 8,000 troops Uncle Sam still keeps on German soil are costing as much as the 150,000 France has in the same country . THE GOLD STANDARD The greatest service the United States can render civilizatiOn in war reconstruction is the maintenance of the gold standard and in the maintenance of that standard she is entitled to the partnership of France . The United States has always stood ready to cooperate with France and Great . Britain whenever they desired to restore the monetary value of silver . The opportunity was recently offered when silver was near 16 to 1 parity and had Europe spoken the word silver could have been saved in the world 's coinage and in Oriental exchanges . - Now in Europe silver circulates as subsidiary money only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper have taken its place in France and a cheap imitation or copper alloy has taken the place of the shit- , ling in the coinage of King George . With only 50% in- , stead of 92%% silver in the new coins of the British ; Realm , they are rapidly turning a. dirty yellow . The pound1 sterling was originally silver . Yet for four centuries the standard of English silver coins has remained unchanged . Thus is the whole coinage , money and credit of the world awry with the United - States , in peace as in war hope of the world for sound measurements and honest standards . The world was too busy in war 's reconstruction to note the opportunity for silver restoration and again the world is out of joint , cast and west , and top and bottom in its metal monies . In the last six months of last year England spent 56 million pounds in an attempt to hold the value of the Indian rupee at two shillings . The government had to abandon the struggle and the rupee , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the year . While this silver struggle was going on , importers in both Australia and Argentina were clamoring without effect for the government to abolish its embargo ? on ex port of gold . THE INFLATION Before the war . Germany 's wonderfully knit-together currency and credit systems needed only two billion ! Reichsbank paper marks : mil these were backed with a ! billion and a half gold marks in the Reichsbank . Today the gold in the Reichsbank is only one billion marks , but the paper circulation is anywhere front eighty to above ! one hundred billion marks , according to the way you countl it ? nd estimate the duplications . This is for Germany with a population reduced front , 70,000,000 to 60,000,000 . France , with a population ex panded by Alsace and Lorraine to 40,000,000 , increased her circulation during the war from 6,700,000,000 francs to a little over thirty billion francs . After the armistice she added six billion paper francs and then - for six months strengthened her credit by holding her paper circulation unchanged . Litter she added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under thirty-eight and a half billion . The seriousness of the situation is that the last loan did not yield the full amount expected in new money and to settle pressing government obligations due to the war there must be either government credits , paper issues or Germany must pay as provided in the Versailles treaty . the United States , that clothing makers and cloth weavers getting three times their pre-war wages refused to pay three times pre-war prices for shoes . Soon the shoemakers were refusing to pay three times pre-war prices for clothing . In six months factories and mills were closing down under this " buyers ' strike " . Then Mr. Ford threw a wrench into the machinery of motor distribution and eight million men allied with the motor'industry were asking serious questions . Yet the United States went through the winter without the expected soup kitchens and breadlines . Such was the plethora of the working man 's pocketbook that steaks and chops retailed in Michigan at full war prices right through the winter , notwithstanding the 40% decline in Chicago wholesale price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States to translate wholesale reductions into retail prices , but the movement has been even slower in France . The result is a financial congestion here that is little understood in the States . Last month the authorities summoned the Paris ' market men to conference and gave theM 48 hours to reduce retail prices that had been unchanged since high war prices notwithstanding the reduction in wholesale prices . They were told to reduce or be summarily dealt 3witb ? . They immediately announced reductions of 20 to oc . No such orders of the government , however , have gone forth to the department stores and shops . These complain that they can not afford to . reduce prices , that the public for several weeks , has refused to relieve their shelves of goods and that they can not afford ' to take their losses . The French merchant has little sympathy with that system in the United States which averages profits and losses and more quickly puts the wholesale cut into the retail quotation . DEFLATION ? The United States has led off in the after-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little business revulsion.by reason of the larger aggregation of our business units and the unification of our banking system under the Federal Reserve . It is almost incomprehensible here how the United States could stand the shock , without reflecting it in her banking system beyond high money rates , when a dozen of our fundamental commodities shrunk to pre-war prices and below , and many large concerns wiped off their hooks in a single twelve month all ' the surplus accumulated from war profits . Business men of the United States may now recognize that the safety of their business fabric lay in reduc tion to prices that can be handled by the volume of money and credit safely maintained on a gold basis . When con- ' 1 cerns in the United States expanded their business during the-war from below 100 millions per annum to above 200 1 millions , they little realized that the expansion was more in the mark up than in the tonnage until they came to the banks to borrow the money to carry the inventory . OUR SOLID FOUNDATION Today a manufacturer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of credit what he could not handle a year 1 ago with 30 million credits . Mail order houses , tanners , shoemakers , cloth-mutters and cotton manufacturers have without general disaster brought their inventories to pre- ! war prices and they begin to see that they are laying the ' foundations for a prosperous future that can not be long delayed . Had they attempted to carry the inventory and the wage scale that followed the war , there would have been widespread national wreckage . The decline has been dries-tic , much too drastic in many lines . The merchandise-distributor and manufacturer who must borrow to carry his goods may be easily ruined by a ton sudden shrinkage . But if his capital will carry hint through , he is on a far safer basis even with a shrunken capital than in the way he was heading for the first three months  --  the boom months ? of 1920 . The merchandise , distribution and banking system of France tends to a slower adjustment . Tett : At the bottom of all the trouble in Europe lies the ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching " There is enough in the world for all. - Go in mid consume it . " Italy is in industrial turmoil under the working noon 's demand that capital and management shall divide its profits and leisure and there are no profits and no leisure for either capital or labor . England is in the throes of strikes , with railroad employes and miners ' demands that the fraction still left to the taxpayer shall be stretched to expand the wages of labor even after capital profit has disappeared . France , the home of economy , is today without profit . Like the rest of Europe she is under an eight-hour law that transfers hundreds of thousands from industry to the railroad and government services and puts government expenditurei on a plane the lessened industry can not support . II/ILENESS IN FRANCE The Minister of Labor has arranged with the labor leaders that wages shall rise and fall with the cost of living and the arrangement being amicable all around , everybody tries to be happy . But the fact remains that living does not go down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unemployment is begun , now most noticeable in the motor manufacturing districts . France has never before known unemployment and the amount of it that is tolerable in England and the United States would here make trouble . The question therefore naturally arises whether it is not better to send the French into Germany to collect than to permit destruction at home . THE BLOWS UPON PRANCE Viewed from all points , France and the French are staggering under tremendous national problems . Mr. Wilson has failed them . The league of nations has failed them . Reparations to date have failed them . ' loth wine and water may fail her . The United States will no longer buy French wines ; and throughout the winter , rain has failed to the extent that this yeaek-crops must be a failure unless rain gontes soon . It is therefore little wonder that France is undergoing various kinds of temptations , but the bankers , the lenders of thought and the economists say France will not yield and follow in the wake of the paper money inflation that is over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
