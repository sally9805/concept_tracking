txt " The Genoa conference is equivalent to a revision of the Versailles Treaty , " said Leon Trotzky today . " It can mean nothing else , if you consider it without ' prejudice . The purpose of the Versailles Treaty was to crush Germany and isolate Russia behind a barbed-wire fence . Now Russia and Germany are invited to Genoa to discuss plans for changing the ' reparations ' of Versailles hatred into reconstruction . What is that but revision ? " Success or failure at Genoa depends principally upon the United States . If America participates it will be a real world conference , capable of accomplishing great things . Without America , it will be only a small rehearsal for a world conference that will come later . America 's attitude is enigmatic . She does not speak one way Or the other . We regret it greatly . For America ? I am not speaking conventionally in saying so ? is the one great power whose Interest in no wise contradicts ours . We have many enemies , but with America the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last phrase twice . " in the economic field we might have important interests in common , . and we do not forget America 's help in our terrible famine . America is the one country really helping us . Yet she does not say ' yes ' or ' no ' about Genoa . We await her answer patiently , but with hope . " Trotzky briefly outlined Lloyd George 's realization of the need of re-establishing Europe on a new basis , giving both Russia and Germany a fair chance . Then , after a rapid review of the Frenci ! Ministerial crisis , he continued : " But we really ought to , do business with France , and I believe France will he willing , too , if the United States is present . It all depends on America . " As regards Russia . America is still prejudiced against the Soviet Government by the revolution . But the revolution with all its consequences is a historical fact , just as much as a volcanic eruption . When Vesuvius erupts and destroys - towns and villages it upsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just got to make the best of it and set about rebuilding , as quickly as possible . The revolution is a social eruption , and I hope the United States will soon recognize that and decide to make the best of it . " Trotzky declared that he was puzzled at America 's allowing Japan to invade Russian territory at the very moment when she herself was such a valuable ally to Russia in the fight against famine . The only explanation he could find was that America was not sorry to see the Japanese involve themselves in Siberia , for the double reason that it would weaken them and stir up Russian feeling against Japan . He admitted that this hypothesis might be wrong , but said it seemed reasonable , for he doubted whether the Washington conference , from which Russia , though deeply interested in the Far East , was absent , would really make the Pacific Ocean live up to its name . Just the same , he said , if the disarmament question was raised at Genoa . and if America supported it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He concluded his political review with a sarcastic attack upon the League of Nations . After repeating much of what he said in public last night , he added : " And now Finland asks this phantom , in which , by law . our enemy Japan is represented , to arbitrate between her and us . What does the- League reply in this case , where Finnish bandits , led by officers of the Finnish army , are ravaging , our territory ? The League actually suggests our good friend Poland as arbitrator . Can you believe it ? But I 'll say one thing  --  the League surely picked an expert on banditry . " The allied officers  --  French , British and American  --  promised to help us when I first refused to sign the Brest-Litovsk Treaty . But the promise was quashed by Paris , London and Washington , which uterly declined to stir a finger to save Russia from invasion . " Trotzky declared that the allied military experts recognized the hopeless state of the Russian army " sprawling like a corpse over the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country " in I t17 , and realized that peace was imperative at the time Kerensky was trying to galvanize the corpse by vain cries of ' fight on to the end . ' After Kerensky 's fall , Trotsky said he knew that the Russian army must be reorganized from bottom to top ; to he decided that he must make peace ; but the German terms were so harsh that he would not sign , despite his lack of resistant force . The Germans promptly advanced and took Minsk and Pakoff . Then Trotsky appealed to the allied officers . " I explained the situation , " he said , " and asked if they would help Russia . There ' were Americans , British , French ? I can give yen their names . They said ' yes , ' and we discussed what form help should take . But their Governments declined to back thorn , so we were forced to sign the treaty , after all . " Efficiency in Trotzky ' Office . ? There is more business efficiency and organization in Trazicy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the . American correspondents today , than in all the rest of Moscow put together . From the outer door , where a sentry was stationed , provided with the list of the correspondents to be admitted , we passed into clean , wellwarmed rooms and corridors , through which a smart young officer led the way to Trotsky 's office , equipped with a field service telephone with reply buzzer attachment for communication inside the building , in addition to the regular city telephone . The whole thing was a sudden transition from Moscow to the Western World . There was no ill-dressed crowd waiting around the rooms and in the passages , amid a litter of cigarette stubs and half-melted snow . In the offices everyone was working without any chatting circle of friends . From the polite veteran with numbered checks for hats and coats to the stenographer who appeared as by magic live seconds after Trotzky spoke an order into the telephone , the whole place was running with a : smoothness that any American business man might envy . Trotsky 's office might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' there was little furniture save chairs and two cupboards  --  one fee ' a card index close to Trotsky 's right hand as he sat . near a window , outside of which a stout iron netting bore evidence of the risk of anarchist violence  --  two or three maps and a long , flat desk before him , piled with books , pamphlets and newspapers in neat array around a clear space in the centre . Among these last were two or three recent copies of the Paris Temps on a heap of Russian papers published In Berlin , Paris and the border States , and two volumes en1 titled " With the Russian Army , " by a British General , Sir Arfred Knox . Trotsky himself was a revelation . I said last night that he spoke like a statesman in the Grand Opera House but today it might have been . Lloyd George with whom we were talking . There was the  --  same urbanity , the same ready wit , the same pungent yet not bitter sarcasm , the same adroit turn of a humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-to-man appeal by which the Welsh wizard disarms opposition . For instance , Trotsky was asked : " Do you not think the change in Russian psychology since four years ago will facilitate understanding with other countries ? " " Why don't. yeu shy straight out what you mean ? " he flashed hack , smiling . " Ark if we are n't civilized now instead of the savage : : we were then . You need n't worry about diplomatic dexterity with me ? you know we pride ourselves here on talking straight . " And on Ile went to use the opportunity to give a piece of ' the inside history of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty , to show the reasons for the Bolshevist attitude at that time , concluding : " Anyway , when the Ministers of the great powers talk about Russian brigands and Angora cutthroats we feel that war must have had a demoralizing effect on diplomatic courtesy elsewhere as well as in Russia . " The real purpose of the interview . which ' Trotsky has flatly refused ? to grant hitherto , was evidently connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invitation to attend the Genoa conference . From the outset Trotsky emphasized his sense of the importance of the attitude America might take with reference to the coming conference . He seemed to want to get across to America a clear understanding of Russia 's attitude toward world problems . First Interview Since . Change of Policy . MOSCOW , Jan. 17 ( Associated Press ) . - a- The prediction was made by Leon Trotzky , Soviet Minister of War , in an interview today that the corning Genoa Economic Conference would be a failure t " unless the United States enters it with a heavy hand , " and makes possible the finding of the centre of the world 's political equilibrium . This , he added , was just as difficult a task as it was for Archimedes to find the centre of gravitation . Trotsky 's interview , granted to the for . eign correspondents here , was the first of an authorized nature he had given since the change In Russia 's economic policy . " America 's attitude toward Soviet Russia is enigmatic , " continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in feeding the famine sufferers , but refuses to voice her political attitude . We are watching this with regret , and . hope her attitude will change . " " We believe it to be due to the United States not being properly informed about the Soviet Government , " Trotzky added . He smiled as he said this , and remarked to his interviewers : " I make this statement with apologies to you , fellow-journalists . " There were seven American correspond dents , two Englishmen and one Italian present , but , regardless of what question was asked . Trotsky 's answer rarely failed to bring out some statement emphasizing the Soviet Government 's belief that the Genoa conference would fall , and Europe could not , be restored without American co-operation : " Russia is not for the League of Nations , " said the War Minister , " and if the Genoa conference turns into a League of Nations affair It ' will be useless . America will have nothing to do with the League of Nations , and neither will Russia . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals Soviet Russia would make at Genoa , and whether the Far Eastern situation would be discussed , Trotzky replied that Russia would not go to the conference with any idea of outlining her program , but in the belief that all the world troubles growing out of the war would be considered . When inquiry was made as to what would be the Soviet Government 's attitude at Genoa toward the general disarmament program , Trotsky said Russia favored such a program , but was skeptical regarding the attitude of France . As to the reparations question , the Was Minister smilingly remarked that Russia had so many repairs to make at home that she had n't much time to help in other people 's . In a more serious mood he declared that Russia would be ready to discuss reparations if the powers demanding them would show a disposition to grant honest co-operation in rebuilding Russia and make it possible to convert- her great natural resources into means of payment . Questions concerning the Cholia , the Soviet secret inquisitorial body , and regarding conditions in the prisons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in bringing about the social revolution in Russia . " Some people may disapprove the methods adopted in the revolution , " he said , but we won against groat odds with such methods . The revolution is a historic fact , and as the new order is established on a Soviet basis , it is here to stay . Efforts to overthrow it will be useless . It is legalized and permanent , and people inside and outside of Runirla must adapt themselves to it . People may not like a volcano , but they ca n't stop its eruption . " Trotsky first greeted the correspondents in German , then shifted to French and finally offered to reply to questions put in English if spoken very slowly . But the membership of the conference was so international that it seemed that there was no language common to all . Trotsky laughingly asked the correspondents who knew German to raise their hands . Then he took a vote on those who spoke French , Russian and i English . The French language won .
