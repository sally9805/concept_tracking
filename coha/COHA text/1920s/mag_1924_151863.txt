CONGRESS Vacant Seat <P> The death of Senator Colt of Rhode Island ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) leaves a situation which may bear the seeds of national consequence . Senator Colt 's term was to expire next March . Whoever is elected to fill out his term will have only about three months ' active service in Congress . Ordinarily there would not be a great fight for such a seat . Now it is different . The composition of the Senate is 50 Republicans , 43 Democrats , two Farmer-Laborites , one vacancy . Assuming , however , that the election of President and Vice President should be thrown into Congress , it is to be expected that the two Farmer-Laborites with at least three Republicans , LaFollette , Ladd and Frazier , would vote for Gov . Bryan rather than for Gen. Dawes . This would make the lineup : Bryan 48 , Dawes 47 . Hence the vacant seat , then occupied by either a Republican or a Democrat , might make a great difference in the result . <P> So both parties will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhode Island seat as they will for the long term which follows .
