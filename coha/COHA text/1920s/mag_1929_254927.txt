KING SPIDER-D . Bevan Wyndham Lewis-Coward McCann &; Edwin V. Mitchell ( $5 ) . <P> " Louis XI , the medieval , knew all there is to know about efficiency : the value and power of Money , and its use in buying men , the importance of the single personal command , the importance of time . " He was the biggest big executive of his day , a man who spent his life bringing order on a large scale out of colossal chaos . Louis ' father , Charles VII , had been that weak-kneed Dauphin whom Joan of Arc crowned . Charles turned out better as a king than he had been as a Dauphin ; but when his impatient son Louis ( he led two rebellions against his father ) came to the throne , at 38 , he found France still disunited , Paris disloyal , the English threatening , and such powerful nobles as the Duke of Burgundy openly his enemies . The whole kingdom was exhausted by the Hundred Years ' War . Fertile regions were wastelands ; brigandage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never his home town , Louis had no sympathy and less patience . Once he made a speech to some learned scholars of Paris ' famed Sorbonne . Said he : " You are a bad lot . You lead bad lives , with the great fat trollops you keep ! " With England he fought , when he thought he could win ; made treaties , when he thought he could win that way . When the great Houses of Burgundy , Bourbon , Brittany , Lorraine , Artois , Alenon , Armagnac , Anjou leagued against him , he played them off one against the other , overcame them gradually by force , craft or bribery . When he died , at 60 , he left a united France and a dynasty that lasted for 300 years . <P> Louis XI was no picture-book king . He had " a long ugly nose . . . a pair of oblique eyes too deeply set , thin lips , a powerful jaw . . . a jutting chin ; " was less than middle height , bald , thin-shanked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blunt , he required others to be the soul of brevity . Like many autocrats , he preferred plain people to the aristocracy . His favorite hat , high-peaked , shapeless , banded with leaden images of saints , was famed . But once at least he ordered a new one . He wrote to his General of Finances : " I have forgotten to ask you to finance me with a hat similar to the one which the Bishop of Valence , Messire Loys de Poictiers , gave me , which he said he had brought from Rome . I think it was of some felt other than beaver , a good inch thick , covering the shoulders and back completely , and coming well over the horse 's crupper ; it was also well turned up in front and at the sides , so that one had no need of a cloak against the rain , and in hot weather it was as good as a little house . " <P> Louis ' one passion ( outside of his job ) was hunting . He liked women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and was twice married , purely as a matter of business . Suspicious , he had an elaborate system of spies . Relentless , he hung traitors or put them in iron cages . Personally brave , he was terribly afraid of death .
