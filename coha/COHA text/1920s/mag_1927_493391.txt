A New York Diary THERE is an honest grossness about the new " Artists and Models " which in these hypocritical times is somewhat appealing . " Rabelaisian " will not fit ; that is too big a word , but the word " French " ( with due regard for its derivation ) will describe at least three of the skits in this show . They are both salacious and comic , whereas by . local standards these qualities , when found in combination , are disapproved . Again , the production strikes a heavy ' blow at the national tradition of which Mr. Earl Carroll Was the special guardian : the folk-belief that the female form is walking Art . As the showgirls stalk in for one memorable number , it transpires that the sumptuous raiment of each is in some critical respect deficient ; here a bare flank , there a tummy , there a pinkly palpitant backside , are exposed to the kisses of the atmosphere and the guffaws Of the visiting buyers . This is an affront to American womanhood ; let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong on comedy , and in a strong way , and Florence Moore , of course , is a powerful asset to such , e.a show . Jack Osterman , on the whole , is another , the Pretty Marietta O'Brien has the idea , the pretty threehundred-pounder Margie Evans makes every ounce count ; among the principals only Jack Pearl , a German comedian Who needs better lines , becomes actively tiresome . Some of the scenes and nearly all the painted backdrops in ' Artists and Models " are distinguished . Any remarkable dancing is confined to the chorus and two astounding male tap-dancers , King and King . The score is debited to Harry Akst and Maurie Rubens , and collectors of atrocities are notified that for the sake of a cheap song called ( if memory serves ) " Bracelets , " soiled hands have been laid upon the " Fifth Nocturne " of Chopin . From the musical standpoint the evening is saved by the late appearance of Ted Lewis ' orchestra , which , for those who ask no apologies from jazz , is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays ( as it played ( ' 1 " a Columbia record ) Lewis ' version of the " St. Louis Blues , " the most interesting jazz arrangement since Grofe 's of the " Rhapsody in Blue . " " Artists and Models " drags for considerable stretches , but lowbrow and tired highbrow ' ' 7 " 1 join forces to buy it out . It is a misfortune for Miss Mae West that she did not . ' take a name for herself in Paris . Her fame in New York is entirely to her traffic in plays ( which she writes and which she appears ) like " Sex , " " The Drag , " and " The Wickethe - d Age , " the first two being generally considered as cause of the new censorship . What no one seems to have noticed is her amazing technique , both in writing il1d in acting . " The Wicked Age , " recently defunct , is utterly trivial ; its pointlessness rises at times to the ex- vi'lisite heights of dada , its plotlessness approaches Chekhov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimonials , which is ferocious and funny , alid a .. gin party which , in spite of preposterous details , is ' 5.11lehow.a gin party and not a stage gin party . Above all , here is the most economical - stage technique now visible o 4iss West 's own acting . Her voice is toneless most f 0 le time ; she rarely moves a muscle ; she repeats the last remark of another character and by the faintest inflection either makes it repartee or carries along the conversation . All of these things and the vulgarity of the surroundings are exactly what we should have raved over if we could have discovered them abroad : sublime commonness , supreme naive technique and all the rest of it . It is , at the moment , almost impossible to sit through the dullness of her play ; it is , on the other hand , entirely impossible to leave the theater while her startling and fascinating figure remains on the stage . The growing sentimentality of the New York newspapers is positively disquieting ? to newspaper men , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , human-interest stories are being treated with an overpowering sentimentality . The worst offender is the Telegram , in the . Scripps-Howard tradition , which features a story charged with emotional fine writing at the bottom of page one so frequently that it is almost an institution . Robert Garland , on the editorial page , sometimes treats a story the same way , but , after all , that is editorial-page stuff , as appropriate as Frank Sullivan 's comic news reports were . on the World before he became a columnist . The World is letting itself go at a great rate ; too . The lead of a story runs from , " Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! And three more redskins ( say gangsters ) bit the dust " to " On a dusky road pear the city of N ? Y ? , in the year to ? , a weary traveler ( say straphanger ) might have been seen . .. . " The death of Little Augie the gangster was a signal for such romps in nearly all the papers , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones about dogs , cats , and lost babies are lifted to prominence with pictures . It is rather silly journalism , and surely a concession to the tabloids ; and I have noticed that it has already led to a strange latitude in reportorial language . A witness at a recent murder trial was described as " ignorant and ugly " ; the unfortunate Mr. Kidwell who expected a car a block long for being a good yes-and-no man was tried in the news columns on his appearance and his record . If this goes on , there will presently be room in New York for a nice dull paper with the old-fashioned idea of presenting the news . As practitioners of a profession , engineers are almost completely anesthetized . With the exception of the few powerful minds that conceive a great work of engineering which is also a work of art , engineers have no sense whatever of the effect upon eye and mind that their works produce : the disorderly factory districts , the gawky iron bridges which are the characteristic products of the en-gineer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell Gate Bridge or a reservoir like that at Kensico . Architects , even when they do not succeed in achieving beauty , at least try to ; whereas engineers , if they sometimes fail to achieve ugliness , feel themselves under no particular obligations to avoid it . In this anesthetized profession , the road engineer and the army engineer do not stand out as exceptions ; alas ! quite the contrary ; their blindness is invincible . Some day the sins of these unamiable and obtuse gentlemen will be fully catalogued ; and when the time conies , I trust that the army engineers ' complete and highly successful demolition of High Bridge will not pass unnoticed . It happened to be one of the finest stone bridges in the East ; we had worried along with it for more than two generations without losing our share of the commerce and industry of the continent ; but the army engineers discovered that it was an obstruction to the traffic of the Harlem River ; and , in the interests of our handicapped commerce and navigation , they decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , including , if I remember rightly , the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects , they have carried through their work of demolition . I trust they will not stop at this point . There is an even finer bridge , the Brooklyn Bridge , which is also an obstruction to navigation : battleships must lower their aerial masts when they pass under it ! Something bigger and better should be put in its place ; the army engineers will , doubtless , know how and what . In improving the watercourses of New York for navigation and defense , they are capable of doing everything that a triumphant enemy might do in a mood of malignant destruction . The death of Walter Fuller a little while ago recalled to my mind all he had done to make the Freeman , in the first two years of its existence , a paper with a flavor and an individuality . He himself wrote scarcely at all ; but that only made him the better editor , for he threw himself into the work of his contributors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their matted thoughts , removing the edges of boorishness , adding a whimsical turn of humor to the most matter-of-fact work , until suddenly ? lol it had the stamp of the Freeman ; the humor , the grace , the urbanity that it claimed for its own . Mr. Nock himself set the tone for the paper ; it was Walter Fuller 's role , in the formative period , to catch the essence of Mr. Nock better than anyone else could do , and to stand as a buffer between Mr. Nock and the less practised contributors , until they , too , had become animated with it . How well do I remember Fuller 's quick outstretched hand , his bright nervous eye , his puckish moments of inspiration . English by birth , a Mancunian by education , he was at home in neither England nor America : when here , he remembered the bright red cottages , the neat hedges and the lush parks of England ; when in England he remembered the openness of American manners and the informal ease of American friendships : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite one 's qualities not to be a little " out of it . " A valuable part of the Freeman died , for me , when Walter Fuller left it in 1922 to return to England ; a man like Fuller , so cordial , so enthusiastic , so tender and loyal , had a value to the paper out of all proportion to the calculable work that he did ; and such people ? there are none too many of them ? have a similar value in the world . One can not place one 's hand on what Walter Fuller did ; but one cherishes deeply all that he was ; and one knows that deeds and achievements scatter like dust , whilst such a life leaves a permanent trace on every person that it has touched . The curious name " Yarnekraw , " which may have puzzled readers of one of the poems in James Weldon Johnson 's " God 's Trombones , " belongs to the Negro settlement in Savannah . It has just bobbed up again , as the title of an equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composer of popular songs . The latter 's compatriot and publisher , Perry Bradford , shall have the first word here on the subject of this musical outburst : We are announcing the latest work or opus of the renowned jazz pianist , James P. Johnson . This artist has endeavored to assemble all of the rhythmical phrases that deal strictly with necrology and with 110 spared efforts we have tried to compile the same in twenty-six pages . The treatise chants spiritualisticallY , also embraces the common rhythms known as blues , spirituals and jazz , then modulates to its destiny , and many sequences are to be found uncommon to the popular type of music . . . . We may boast of this as a wholly American theme . Unless the passage beginning at page eight represents the movement of rubber-tired hearses , diligent search of Mr ! Johnson 's opus uncovers nothing dealing with necrology ; but with this exception Mr. Bradford talks gospel . " It is not , " he continues , " a Rhapsody in Blue , but a Rhapsody in Black and White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope it will meet with your approval . " It does . What its writer has done has been to take a fely themes , and so skillfully to juggle about and disguise then ' in the numberless intuitive rhythms of his race , that theY have come to compose something approaching a Yanie ? kranian anthology . Although the themes are melodicallY his own , these rhythmical figures go back to the Charleston , back to " The Alabama Blues , " to " The Maple Lea. ! Rag , " to " Under the Bamboo Tree , " the pat-dance " Sal Away Ladies , " the spiritual called " Who Is Dat Yondah , , , in Miss Jessye 's collection , to the corn-songs , the " ballets ' and back to the war dance ; and as one after another melts into the next , we come to realize sharply that they are all of one fabric . Moreover , these blues are , blues , and chirpy and mean ones ; the " spiritualistic portions are graceful and melancholy ; the jazz is hot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their leaps and convolutions , are in character , as are the triple grace notes , the descending tenths and the bouncily ! octaves in the bass ; and it is not the composition 's leas/ achievement that , except for the prefatory gesture towariu Gershwin , it ignores the existence of the white race : It ? asks for no ponderous judgment that it has reconciled JAll with the Muse . It might have written its motto in , the poet 's words : You can keep your attics , take the roof or the air you choose , But my highest aspiration is the basement blues . In short , it is interesting , and it is genuine . It 19 With able at present only for the piano , and at the speed w're. which its composer takes it , it calls for galloping htigcr , Fletcher Henderson should orchestrate it , deposit aIv'tit Johnson at a twenty-foot concert grand all clustered b:o , with saxophones , and show the white folks what a ti oughly aroused town named Yamekraw can say for itse ( The writer learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now been arranged by the colored composer William G. Still for the Don Voorhees orchestra , which will very shortly both broadcast it , and record it for the Columbia Phonograph Company . ) The Sportsman 's Tragedy HE reputation of Ernest-Hemingway has , in a very short time , reached such proportions that it has already become fashionable to disparage him . Yet it seems to me that he has received in America very little intelligent criticism . I find Lee Wilson Dodd , for example , in the Saturday Review of Literature , with his usual gentle trepidation in the presence of contemporary life , deciding with a sigh of relief that , after all , Ernest Hemingway ( a young man who has published only three books ) is not Shakespeare or Tolstoy ; and describing Hemingway 's subjects as follows : " The people he observes with fascinated fixation and then makes live before us are . . . all very much alike : bull-fighters , bruisers , touts , gunmen , professional soldiers , prostitutes , hard drinkers , dope fiends . . . . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or morally worth , he makes his facts ours . " In the Nation , Joseph Wood Krutch , whose review is more sympathetic than Mr. Dodd 's , describes Hemingway as follows : " Spiritually the distinguishing mark of Mr. Hemingway 's work is a weariness too great to be aware of anything but sensations . . . . Mr. Hemingway tells us , both by his choice of subject and by the method which he employs , that life is RH affair of mean tragedies . . . . In his hands the subject matter of literature becomes sordid little catastrophes in the lives of very vulgar people . " I do not know whether these reviewers of " Men without Vomen " ( New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons ) have never read Hemingwav 's other two books , or whether they have simply forgotten there . Do the stories in " In Our Time " and in " The Sun Also Rises " actually answer to these descriptions ? Does " Men without Women " answer to them ? The hero of " In Our Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new volume , and the hero of " The Sun Also Rises , " are both highly civilized persons of rather complex temperament and extreme sensibility . In what way can they be said to be " very vulgar people " ? And can the adventures of even the old bull-fighter in " The Undefeated " be called a " sordid little catastrophe " ? One of the stories in " Men without Women " also appeared in The American Caravan , and was thus twice exposed to the reviewers ; yet in all the reviews I have read of both volumes I can not remember one which seemed to me to give an accurate account of it . It has almost invariably been mentioned , briefly , as a simple tale of horror or a tale of brutality , or something of the sort . Let us examine this story a moment . Two young men have been skiing in the Alps : it is spring and the sun is terrifically strong ; but in the shade , the sweat freezes in their underclothes . They have begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inn . On their way , they have passed a burial , and at the inn they hear the story of the woman who is dead . She was the wife of a peasant and died during the winter , but the husband was snowbound and could not bring her out till spring . The peasant put the body in the wood-shed , laying it on a pile of wood ; but when he had to use the wood , he stood the corpse up in a corner , and got into the habit of hanging the lantern in its mouth . Why , we ask ourselves for a moment , have we been told about the skiing expedition ? Then , immediately , we realize that Hemingway , with his masterly relevance in apparent indirection , has , in the oppression felt by the tourists , supplied us with the explanation of the brutalization of the peasant . This brutalization by itself is not , however , the theme of the story . We do not see the point till the end . The peasant will not drink at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial , but goes on to a neighboring one . " He did n't want to drink with me , ' said the sexton . ' He did n't want to drink with me , after he knew about his wife , ' said the innkeeper . " Similarly , " A Pursuit Race " is , as Mr. Dodd would say , a story about a dope-fiend ; but what is more interesting and important , it is also about a man who has just lost a desperately prolonged moral struggle , and it derives its whole significance from the last paragraph , in which the manager of the burlesque show , understanding what has happened and pitying his recreant advance man , refrains from waking him . So in " A Simple Inquiry , " in which we arc shown that strange demoralization of army life which is scarcely distinguishable from stoicism , the value of the incident lies entirely in the fact that the major refrains from dismissing the boy . It would appear , then , that Hemingway 's world was not quite so devoid of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodd . Even when he deals with rudimentary types ? as he by no means always does ? his drama usually turns on some principle of courage , of honor , of pity ? in short , of sportsmanship in its largest human sense ? which he discovers in them . I do not say that the world which Hemingway depicts is not a bad world ; it is a bad world and a world where much is suffered . Hemingway 's : eelings about this world , his criticism of what goes on in it , are , for all his misleadingly simple and matter-of-fact style , rather subtle and complex ; but he has , it seems to me , made it sufficiently plain what sort of emotions and ideas he intends to communicate . His first book was called " In Our Time , " and it was made up of a series of brief and brutal sketches of barbarous happenings mostly connected with the War , alternated with a series of short stories about a sensitive and healthy boy in the American northwest . We were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Hemingway gave them this title , he meant to tell us that life was barbarous , even in our civilized age ; and that the man who sees the cabinet ministers shot and who finds himself potting at the Germans from the " perfectly priceless barricade " has had to come a long way from the boy who , with the fresh senses of youth , so much enjoyed the three days ' fishing trip at Big Two-Hearted River . Yet has he really come so far ? Is not the very principle of life essentially ruthless and cruel ? What is the difference between the gusto of the soldier all on edge to hunt his fellow humans and the gusto of the young fisherman hooking grasshoppers to catch trout ? Hemingway is primarily preoccupied with these problems of suffering and cruelty .
