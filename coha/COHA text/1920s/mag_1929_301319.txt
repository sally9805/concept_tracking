Happy last week , were officers and men of the U. S. S. Utah as their ship rolled up from Rio , taking Herbert Hoover home . Capt . C. R. Train praised his men for having aroused not a single complaint during their shore leave in Brazil . Every man received a Christmas card autographed by President-Elect and Mrs. Hoover . Homecoming plans had been altered to make Washington , not Florida , the journey 's end . Inasmuch as most of the Utah 's personnel live closer to Hampton Roads than to Key West , the change meant that many of them could see wives , families , friends again , before departing on a three months cruise to Panama . It was with joyous tones that some 1,000 gobs gathered on the quarterdeck and sang for their passengers , " Are You Lonesome Tonight " and " Let Me Call You Sweetheart . " . . . <P> It was the fourth Christmas that the Hoovers had spent at sea . The ship 's carpenter had built a fireplace with red electric lights for coals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of binoculars , Mrs. Hoover with a blue and white Brazilian shawl . There was a Christmas tree and a Santa Claus . The Santa Claus ( a disguised newspaper correspondent ) hailed the President-Elect as " greatest fisherman , " and presented him with a gift which he said would prove valuable . It was a toy fish labelled Congress . Mr. Hoover asked what bait was needed for this fish . Soft soap , said Santa . . . . <P> Since the President-Elect obviously had not altered his homeward journey solely for the good of the Utah 's sailors , Washington rumored and conjectured reasons for the alteration . Some said that Mr. Hoover was returning because of unexpected opposition to supposed members of his cabinet-Andrew Mellon in particular , or he was coming home to save the Kellogg-Briand Peace Treaty , or the trouble was that Hubert Work , Republican National Committee Chairman , had planned to take " patronage " ( i.e. , job issuing ) out of Congressional hands and into the committee 's and his own , and Mr. Hoover was going to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> There was also a theory that President Coolidge had summoned the President-Elect to Washington to discuss Germany 's reparations . There was another theory that Congressional leaders wished to confer with Mr. Hoover on farm relief and on the possibility of an extra session of Congress . Finally it was just possible that Mr. Hoover had found too much for him the task of making up a cabinet miles away from everybody . Maybe he was returning to Washington to get some suggestions . Remote aboard the Utah , Mr. Hoover offered no specific explanation .
