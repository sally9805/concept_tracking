Frank Ernest Gannett , chain-paper publisher of Rochester , N. Y. , went quietly to Brooklyn last week . There he completed a dicker terminating negotiations which have dragged on two years and more , realizing an ambition of many years . He took control of the distinguished old Daily Eagle , which during all the 87 years of its existence had been under the continuous ownership of a family group . Two upstate publishers thus became rivals in the huge , various New York City newspaper field . For only last August , another chain-paper man , Paul Block , bought the Brooklyn Standard-Union . Block began his newspaper career in Elmira , N. Y. , and was publishing papers in Newark , Toledo , Duluth and Pittsburgh at the time he purchased the Standard-Union . <P> Gannett , too , spent some of his early years in newspaper work in Elmira . In 1906 he bought a half-interest in the Elmira Gazette , combining it with the Star . He fought shy of the larger cities for years as he expanded his holdings , buying up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial bases . He went to Ithaca , to Rochester , to Utica ; to Plainfield , N. J. ; and back to New York with purchases in Newburgh , Olean and Ogdensburg . <P> In 1924 those who had been associated with him retired and he took full charge of the string of papers . Last year was his triumph . In January he bought the prosperous Hartford Times , at a figure reputed more than $5,000,000 . In October he announced that he had acquired the historic Knickerbocker Press and the Evening News in Albany . <P> Last month he interrupted his series of spectacular purchases and appeared before the country in a new role . A machine which may be of epochal importance in newspaper publishing , by which type can be set by telegraph , was built , tested , proved successful . Gannett was the man who had backed the invention . <P> On the eve of the New Year he announced his third and biggest deal of the twelvemonth . <P> In the Brooklyn Eagle Gannett comes into possession not only of a printing plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Eagle is relatively small - around 80,000- and does not conflict with that of the Manhattan dailies , its editorial influence has been considerable for many decades . Walt Whitman wrote editorials for the Eagle in 1846-48 ; among its editors and critics have been many great names . Most recently , Dr. St. Clair McKelway , editor-in-chief up to his death in 1915 , brought distinction to the paper . <P> During the Civil War the independent attitude of the Eagle resulted in its suspension for a period by the Union authorities . <P> At present Dr. Arthur Millidge Howe is editor , Harris McCabe Crist managing-editor . <P> When Paul Block bought the Standard-Union he gave a theatre party , bought out the house for a performance of George White 's Scandals , invited everyone from Fisticuffer Dempsey to Aviatrix Earhart . Last week Publicist Gannett gave no party on Broadway to celebrate his purchase of the dignified Eagle .
