txt LETTERS TO THE EDITOR ON SUBJECTS OF TIMELY INTEREST BRAZIL 'S CENTENARY Some Data About the South American Republic Utica . N. Y. , Dec. 27 , 1921 . To the Editor of The New York Times : The people of the United States , who have been friendly to Brazil ever since Its political independence , can not overlook the fact that on the 7th day . of September , 1922 . Brazil will celebrate the centenary of its existence . In contrast with other nations . all social revolutions that have taken place in Brazil , such as the abolition of slavery and the proclamation of the republic , have been achieved without any bloodshed . In connection with our coming fair , I very well remember the time , during my college days in 1876 , when Dom Pedro , our . late Emperor , by the side of President Grant , with the touch of his hand started the once famous Corliss engine at the Centennial Exposition . in Philadelphia . He was the only crowned head present at that great event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and hatred . intensified by the late war , and displayed by the very nations which should have set us the best example in their international relations , it ts with great pride that we note our friendly relations to this day . As we study the history of the two republics , we find that an air of cordiality and esteem has always prevailed in the minds of their great men . It is not many years ago that the United States gave us a proof of her great con-1 consideration when Brazil 's co-operation Was requested for the settlement of such Important queetiens as that of the Alabama and Franco-Arnerican Claims , in which took part two eminent Brazilians , ViscountItajuba and Baron Arinos . I ' have been myself a witness of the sincere manifestations of esteem shown In this country , at different times , not only to our late Emperor , Dom Pedro , but to the Envoys Joaquim Nabuco , Lauro Muller and Epitacio Pessoa. the actual President of Brazil ; and among us to no less distinguished Americans than Elihu Root , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not least . Theodore- Roosevelt , the first eminent foreigner to travel through the interior of dur vast country from south to north . These visits will always ? be remembered by the people of both nations as aepresenting a bond Of friendship which stood the test of two regimes without the least break in their cordiality . Both countries harmonize with each other , because both strive toward the same purpose , the same ideals . For the success of our corning exposition we Brazilians can not help - but appreciate the attitude of the American Government . appropriating $1,000,000 for its representation , and presentiag a beautiful statue to be placed in one of our public parks in Rio de Janeiro . A trip to Brazil is now a delightful one at any time of the year . ? And not wishing to appear partial in speaking about my own country . I prefer to have some of your countrymen speak : " As the steamer approaches the coast of Brazil and land is sighted . it is most Interesting to consider that this vast republic is actually larger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as large as France . With the actual land before us , these figures become highly impressive , and the thought that we are rapidly nearing one of the most superb and famous beauty spots in the world increases the pleasurable excitement always felt on coming to any large port . " The harbor of Rio de Janeiro. like that of any scenic marvel , needs more to be seen than described : words and even photographs give a very inadequate idea of its beauty . All the fair adjectives in the English language can be applied to Rio de Janeiro. la is the loveliest and grandest picture in the world . There are striking mountains . both- distant and in tide foreground ; there are charming islands dotted about in a ... great baa whose water is of a color unsurpassed in any other harbor In the world . and which is large enough to hold all the fleets of civilization . " The hillside city , curving around a marvelous crescent beach of miles , rises up from the bay and spreads about In a charming , straggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the site produces various sections and create extraordinary picturesqueness . " The scene . either viewed from a distance or enjoyed intimately , is. : full of Color as well as grandeur . The houses are variously tinted , flowers abound . and the trees are full of beautiful birds . Color is also Supplied lea the butterflies , which are . extraordinarily large and numerous . " On landing , the visitor recalls that the countay was settled by the Portuguese and that the language spoken by the people ' is ? not Spanish . as is generally thought in this country . Brazil was originally called the country of Brazilwood which , - yielding a dye needed in Europe . appealed to Americo Vespucci , the explorer In the sixteenth century , as the chief thing of value . Later the name was . shortened to Brazil . Rio de Janeiro means " River ? of January , " a name given . to it in 1549 , more than a hundred years since the site of Rio 's bay was discovered . It was the scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not until two hundred years later that the ? Portuguese secured permanent possession . In 1889 Brazil became a republic . Rio de Janeiro has undergone a magical transformation since 1903 , nearly $100,000,000 being spent in improving , beautifying and making the city healthful . The climate is to usequite upside down , for January is warm and Winter comes in June . July land August . The Avenida Branca is considered by many the most beautiful street in the world . The National ' Library is- the largest south of the Equator . The Ca.ndelaria Church is the richest in South America , admirably adorned . The botanical gardens are widely celebrated as the - most complete collection of tropical plants among the various parks of ' the world . - The Municipal Theatre , a fine institution , encourages national art and maintains high dramatic standards . The Fine Arts Museum is said to be the most extensive and valuable collection of paintings in South America . Praca 15th of November is- an interesting square with gardens and historical buildings of the eighteenth century . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . very narrow and ever picturesque . The Passeio Public ? is the oldest public garden , containing vegetation dating from 1'aS3 when it was foundea . Here is a splendid aquarium , also with attractive pavilions . The Beira Mar is one of the most beautiful ocean boulevards in the world , and the ride from Monroe Palace to the foot of the " Sugar Loaf " ( Pao de Assuca.r ) is one of the loveliest imaginable . The view from the " Sugar Loaf " is delightful , and the top is reached by an electric basket cable car holding twenty passengers , the trip being a unique experience . Perhaps the most astonishing natural feature of Rio de Janeiro is the ascent of Corcovado ( Hunchback ) , the Needle . This is accomplished by a cog railway . the grade being very steep . Corcovaclo is 2,200 feet high and the view is unsurpassed.  - -  Other excursions are to Petropolis , home of the diplomatic circle and fashionable from December to May . It is in a high , beautiful country . Tiauca , 3,300 feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns of Nova Triburg ? and Therezopolis are at about 3,000 feet . with a perfect climate . For the celebration of our centenary , with a full representation of the United States and other friendly countries , and to make It more inviting . we are remodeling same a our beautiful sights - by leveling , some of our hills , building huge hotels and at the same time constructing good automobile roads , so our guests might be able to visit not only the surroundings of our capital , but also , some parts of our great " hinterland , " stretching from 4 degrees above the Equator to 30 degrees below . To the foreigner of this century . Brazil is the country of wonderful possibilities , of . wealth accumulated in her soil and subsoil , hardly scratched , and yet , so near the United States . It is the country of iron , , of manganese , bluewhite diamonds , fibres and fine woods , mineral oils . vegetable offs and unrivaled goat skins and many other things worthy of being studied for commercial purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to visit Sao Paulo , our marvelous coffee region , regular gardens which supply more than*two-thirds of the beverage used every morning in this country . A great many of our coffee States will remind you of the intensified agrieulture of your great West and such modern packing houses as those erected by the intelligent enterprise of Armour , Swift and Wilson . With our treaty of commercial reciprocity , the great world-of James G. Blaine and Salvador de Mendonga , and fast ship service , the least friction is unthinkable between the two countries . This should be an object lesson and an incentive to the whole world still fighting for territories ande predominance of one nation over another . J. C. ALVEZ DE LIMA , Brazil Consular Inspector . " DEBS OF THE GENIAL SMILE " To the Editor of The New York Times : Debs of the genial smile has been given his liberty by Executive clemency , and a ' that and a ' that . An act of mercy inspiringly expressive of the season of good-will , to be followed , requited , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . the land of his birth , against which he , in conjunction with his followers , had opposed himself in its most recent hour a trial . Free but unpardoned , unrestored to full civil ' rights . he rejoices the more . A citizen not of his own country , but , ae he proudly proclaims. of the world , his unrepentance. his un-Americanism , rises stridently-defiantly -- to its highest note . He re-enters , red-bannered , redfollowed , the assault against the existing order , more dangerous , more powerful than ever before . A tour of Russia to poison afresh that sorry country-our- quondam friendagainst the land of his birth , already , we are told , is being arranged for him . Next a swing . under Soviet auspices , around other European countries , and then home . Home , to do what ? To instil into the minds of the unthinking the subtle poison of Sovietism . To provoke to greater bitterness the existing differences between employer and employed , ' striving by every trick and device of an enhaloed soapboxer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To usher In that revolution of which his followers have called him the incarnation . The Gene Deb s smile ! How . often have we heard this expression ! Today it has for us a new significance , recalling that of Bret Harte 's heathen Chinee . A. M. To the Editor of The New York . Times : In your editorial of Dec. 26 you go out of your way to attack President Harding 's act of clemency in releasing Debs , whom you admit is entitled to respect as a brave and constant man . but whom you yet characterize as a far Worse and more dangerous criminal than a murderer . Your editorial shows Unusual heat and apparent personal bitterness toward this man who was , as , you are at pains to point out , convicted fairly and sentenced deservedly under the espionage law . If , however . the law itself was a law ' neither calmly conceived nor administered , but one brought forth in the hysterical heat of war , then your entire thesis , based upon Its sanctity , wherein you declaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is itself quite unsound and shallow . I submit that this espionage law , the various State sedition laws and the whole pack of wartime repressive and restrictive laws which operated to transform the liberty of the individual citizen into the license of the Federal agent Were not only contrary to all established American traditions . but were insidious thorns in the moral honor and conscience of all true and self-respecting - Americans , and were only tolerated by them as a very deplorable necessity during the actual duration of the war . ( I refer you to Professor Zechariah Chaffee 's ' . Freedom of Speech , " recentlypublished. for the legal viewpoint ) . - Justice , " when bred of war and seen through eyes blurred by tears and fears . ' very easily ceases to be the same : brand of justice - Which is enacted in , time of peace and seen with true vision . This . peculiarity of mortals in time of war ; is so generally recognized by all civilized'nations that one of their . first acts after peace is restored is the release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium . it is at the same time a graceful admission . though perhaps a very painful one to make at the time . that possibly we may bave done those things which we ought not to have done , but it shows that there is still some moral health left in us . For President Harding to take the step he did , in the face of the broadcast chauvinistic opposition of the American Legion , supposedly the mouthpiece of over four million voters , required more courage than for Woodrow Wilson to swim with the tide of contemporary vociferous opinion by refusing his release . I believe that the majority of those who recently fought to uphold the maritime rights and honor of . this country were rather disappointed , upon their return with no spoils save honor . to find that this honor had already : been besmirched by the hysterical . but doubtless well-meant . wartime " justice " accorded to persons who had honestly differed-with the- great working majority In their opinions and actions during the stress of . war . . Yet you . as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " howling . whining miriority. " all those persons who believe that the true ends of justice will be better served by freeing a political prisoner ( Debs has not Yet been pardoned ) than by obstinately continuing ' his incarceration only to strengthen the belief of his many adherents that he is a martyr in thcatise of socialism . LAWRENCE KEYES . New York , Dec. 26 , 1921 . MORE ON CENTRALIA TRIAL Wheeling . W. Va .. Dec. 24 , 1921 . To the Editor of The New York Times : After reading the communication of Edward Townsend ' Booth protesting against methods employed to convict the men charged with the death of the members of the American Legion in Centralia , I , too , wish to join in the protest . I sat in the courtroom at Montesano during the progress of that trial . The dbcisions of presiding Judge Wilson suppressing evidence favorable to the defendants shook my faith in the Integrity of the American court . The means employed to convict the prisoners revealed to me the depths to which men who control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acts of terrorisin was unfavorable to the accused . A.gedts for the defense were hampered in their legitimate work . The courtroom held a , large number of Legionnaires who wee paid a daily wage to sit through the proceedings and by so doing prevent the entrance of unbiased spectators . The ' verdict was not justified by the evidence submitted . Eugene Barnett . who was accused of the killing of Warren 0 . Grimm , for whose death the whole eleven stood trial , was found guilty of third degree murder . Judge Wilson would not receive that verdict The jury again retired and entered after a short time with the surpriaing verdict of " second degree . " They must have had grave doubts regarding the guilt of this man , else why find him guilty of a lesser charge the first time ? Many rumors were in circulation while the case was being tried . The bailiff In charge of the jury was the object of most of them . Attorney Vanderveer of the defense repeatedly urged Judge Wilson to dismiss this man from.his position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal troops were called to Montesano and camped near the courtroom ; some of them were stationed in the anteroom of the jail . The Sheriff denied having sent for them . He stated that conditions did not warrant their presence . Judge Wilson severely called to account those who were responsible for ' the troops being there . He retired to weigh the matter of - dismissing them as being unnecessary , and then decided that as he was not the one who ordered them on the scene he did net see why he should . be the one picked to dismiss them . Witnesses who testified to the fact that Warren 0 . Grimm was raiding the I. V. W. hail when he received his death wound were arrested on leaving the stand and charged with perjury. but they were never brought tp trial . It seemed to be done to influence the jurors . Motion for a new trial was denied . The case went through - all the legal phases possible under the laws of the State . of Washington . Legally- the men were pronounced guilty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreyfus . We know now that a wrong was committed against these men : May noe a wrong . have . been - committed also ? against the Centralia defendants ? Agreeing with Mr. Booth , I say , " If the prestige . of a . great newspaper like THE TImas were used to ascertain and publish these facts from'the documentary sources at Montesano , the country would be astounded . " WILLIAM SHEEHAN . RAILWAY VERSUS TRUCK Chicago . Dec. 28 , 1921 . A member of our association has recently forwarded a clipping from your paper , with notation that it ? appeared therein on Nov. 27 , in which Major Church , transportation eengineer of the Port of New York Authority , argues for ' the creation of special motor truck highl ways to be equipped with stations and to be under the same supervision , with the same regulations respecting traffic ' schedules , as railways . The suggestion-of the Major is very interesting , but his article would have been more interesting had he mentioned that it was his purpose to have these highways built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create competition for the railways at the expense of the taxpayers . and the railways which will sutrer most trom such , competition as Major Church proposes to create are among the heaviest taxpayers in New York City and vicinity . With all due deference to the suggestions of the Major , it would appear that the more logical course wauld to build a complete system of railways under the Port of New York Authority at the expense ' of the taxpayers , for such railway routes will tast iess than the very expensive type ef motor roads which the Major proposes . to construct . will last at least five times as long , and the engines , rolling stock , dee , required will cost much less because of their - longer life and much slower depreciation . while the expense of transporting goods will be definitely less on account of the much larger loads which can be hauled . If ? we must develop added transportation facilities for freight , at public expense , by all means go the whole distance and build State-owned railways , routed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant terminals which Major Church suggests . As a matter of fact , the logical course for New Yark or any other city to take Is to develop its rail and water trans , portation to the limit , arranging for abundant terminals , so that all hauls will be short hauls . P. J. Finnegan , President of the CMcago Cartage Exchange , whose recent Untimely death is mourned by all who knew him , was the first to point out the fundamental relationship between city growth and horse use . He said : " No city earl give adequate service to its merchants , factories and residents unless adequate freight and express terminals are provided . Any manufacturer knows that the ideal location is where rail and water shipments can be loaded or unioa.daj from the factory platform . When this ideal can not be attained , the next best location is where short heeds prevail . for no argument . is ' needed- to prove that it costs less to move a carload of goods a short distance than a long distance . Short hauls favor business by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous team tracks give their merchants and manufacturers a substantial advantage over cities not so well planned . Cornpetition will force all cities to develop abundant terminals and team tracks , and this factor will inevitably lead to increased horse use . " Our investigations in cities during the past year bear this out in a striking manner . Boston , with many wharves and team tracks , has very few hauls that are not under two miles for the round trip , and Boston moves her enormous shipments of wool , leather . fish , vegetables , fruits , iac. , at a very low cost . Seventy-five per cent . of her merchandise is horse-drawn . and she enjoys the distinction of having the best iot of horses , on the average , of any city in America . Philadelphia , with numerous wharves along the river and frequent team tracks . is also a city where merchants and manufacturers enjoy the advantage of short hauls , and here again we fina keen appreciation of the economy of horses in such work . Chicago has railway terminals and team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants who are awake to traffic economies have cars consigned to their nearest terminal or team track . Freight costs are no more , and cartage costs are greatly reduced : New York has many tong hauls , and the New York Harbor Commission , in a ' most exhaustive report covering more than 300 pages . sets forth the faults ) of the existing system and recommends the creation of added water and railway freight terminals which will.make it possible for any merchant or manufacturer to have his goods arrive at a specified near-by terminal . The economy of the short haul is especially emphasized . ? Thorough investigations covering six months-Jan. 1 to July 1 this year-were made in New - York , Philadelphia , Baltimore . Washington . D. C. Boston , Springfield , Hartford . New Haven . Lowell . Providence and other Eastern cities . Especial attention Was given not only to the use of horses but to analyzing where and why displacement had occurred . Our men interviewed , also , lca , ding transportation users in. all cities visited , and secured-direct , signed state- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city business . As a result of these . studies , other surveys made , and definiteestatements and cast figures furnished ' to us by firms who own and use-51,927 head of horses , we are noel in aposition to say positively that on hauls within a horse 's working radius . 1 . e. , the distance a team can travel in a day , horses furnish more economical service than motorized equipment . This holds good on both straightaway , heavy duty hauls and on houseto-house delivery . The amount : of difference in favor of horses depends upon a number of factors , but the difference is always there . Consequently , when low cost of transportation is the controlling motive , as it is in most heavy hauling , horses have a decided advantage . On local delivery work , from store to store or house to house , the evidence . overwhelmingly for horse-drawn equipment . Ice companies , coal companies , groceries , bakeries , milk companies and all others whose business involves frequent stops and delivery work , agree emphatically with the great packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under twenty miles per day , the horse is niest economical . " Many companies ep further , handling routes of thirty- miles per day by using two horses per delivery wagon , using them half a day ? or day about . They find this system satisfactory and more economical than the use of motel 's on such routes . The packers emphasize four fundamental features of horse use in their report-low initial investment .. long life , low . repair Cost and moderate maintenance-all of which appeal to business men . , lt is our job to bring them so forcefully to the attention of all firms as to cause them to analyze their casts and to put horses on all work that is best clone by teams . - I have written thus fully because 1 have a firm belief in the fairness of the press and am confident that aou will give space to this ? letter in order that your business men , residents and other men who are interested . may ? be correctly informed on a matter of such farreaching importance . " WAYNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAOS . To the Editor of The New York Times : - Industry and many thousands of skilled mechanics now unemployed throughout our country are patiently and anxiously waiting for Congress to bring the United States Patent Office out of chaos and into efficient life again . As a manufacturer whose products are made in this and other cities , and after a recent visit to several of our large industrial centres , I feel more than ever that our Patent Office , which has for generations been the incentive for and protector of American initiative , needs the immediate attention- of both Congress and the President . Stagnated business conditions and an overproduction of staple products have thrown thousands of men and women out of employment . Little new capital Is now being invested in these branches of our industries : Today , thousands of manufacturers who are ready to invest new capital and re-employ idle skilled labor in the production a novelties and new processes will not go ahead until assured of protection by the Patent Office . The Patent Office is some nine months behind , when every economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if never before . Without any criticism of the earnest efforts of the men in this great branch of our Government service , the old patent law and salary schedilles of many years past are rapidly destroying the efficiency of the Patent Office . A large percentage of the experienced technical men vital tothe Patent Office ' service have left its employ , and the pending legislation , which has been drawn to restore the Patent Office tcf Its old condition . - seems to have been submerged by other matters until this matter must now be considered as a great national necessity . President Harding . the Department of Commerce and Congress must be brought to a realization that immediate action must now be taken to save this traditional foundation stone of American industry from utter collapse . Little is publicly known of this matter , and it seems to me that it can not too forcibly be brought to the attention of those whose responsibility it is to protect and help dormant capital and labor back to active work and permanent prosperity . - HERBERT L.

LONGWORTH AND TARIFF Protection Is Presented as Influenced by Politics Baltimore . Dee . 26. 1921 . To the Editor of , The New York Times : The perplexity of the Hon. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tariff bill to meet the unsettled business conditions both here and abroad clearly demonstrates the inherent weakness and injustice of the theory of protection , - to which this member of the House Ways and Means Committee has given his devotion as a follower of the Republican Party . ' Heretofore no advocate of protective tariffs has admitted ' that our economic welfare could be Influenced by industrial conditions in Europe . Leaders of the protectionists , including , of course , President , declared as a part of their sacred ritual that the higher tariffs were the more perfect was the protection given American workingmen from the products . of ill-requited labor in ' Europe . In other words , the more complete our isolation as a trading nation from the rest of the world the greater would he our national prosperity : That for ? many decades the American people have been thus cajoled by the high priests of protection into this belief may seem a lamentable fact , but it is merely an illustration of the blind , unquestioning faith of the masses in the postulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blinded by the Incense from the altar of protection , where he has long ' worshipped , Mr. Longworth , is now groping for some path of safety from the present economic chart , yet seeking to maintain an iniquitous fiscal policy for which there is no defense save by greed and selfishness , an economic : system which is condemned by every dictate of wisdom and justice , and which largely has been responsible for the existing world-wide industrial paralysis . Consider Mr. Longworth 's bewilderment as set forth in his letter to THE TIMES in the issue of Dec. 25 : " There must , I think , " says the perplexed lawmaker , " be a flexible tariff for the next few years . * ' * In studying the tariff schedules it becomes apparent even to the most casual student how difficult it is to write a tariff bill that will be just for any length of time after it becomes operative : A tariff law based upon Old conditions can not meet the needs of the present situation . " Is the above not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past as a national legislator has constantly affirmed his faith in the blessings of protective tariffs ? Just what , may it be asked , are present canditions here and ' abroad-that give pause to this puzzled statesman and cause him to hesitate in restoring the sacred fetich of protection in all its panoply of injustice and greed ? Are not the recurrent needs of humanity absolutely unchanged even by the world cataclysm ? Has the productive power and genius of the American workingman been lessened during the period of world conflict ? Is it not a fact that Mr. Fordney 's endeavor to revive the fullest measure of Government subsidy to representatives of special privilege has had the effect of delaying the normal resumption of industry . acted as an embargo on commerce and halted millions of capital eager and anxious for investment to revivify the slowly ebbing pulse of our economic life ? And may it not also be asked to whom Mr. Longworth balieves injustice would be done by following old-time methods of protection at the present time ? If injustice attended their restoration at this stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framing of tariff laws . If , as Mr. Longworth says , the country is faced with a different condition today than at any other time in history , it is because the old order of economic barriers between nations passed away with the overthrow of bayonet-supported dynasties . Tariffs are only a lesser form of imperialism . They are as indefensible as the claim of individuals to their divine right to rule . In recognition of this great truth President Wilson in No. 3 of his Fourteen Points presented at Versailles called for the removal of all economic barriers , as far as possible , between nations . Most vital to the enduring peace of the world was this far-sighted suggestion by the envisoned statesman , who was even as the Prophet of Palestine . crucified as he sought to awaken an unthinking world . Mr. Longworth 's confusion is entirely due to his inability to rise above petty partisanship to an ' altitude where he can see the operation of natural laws in the world , laws tliat can not be violated without disaster to our entire social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic . Confused as he is by what he terms new conditions which present obstacles to a renewal of past carnivals of greed in the name of protection to Amerlean workingmen , Mr. Long-worth presents a pathetic spectacle in pleading for a flexible tariff . Flexible or otherwise , any tariff framed will be in the interest of some particular group of manufacturers whose industry . however hoary its foundation , will be represented as being in the pulsing infant stage and requires special privileges at the expense of the American people . Without perception of fundamentals , Mr. Longworth may confidently believe that the Limitation of Armament Conference will result in making wars impossible . Whatever this conference may do to reduce the ratio of naval strength of the great powers , the possibility of war always will be present while tariff laws exist to engender national hatreds and jealousies . To banish forever such possibilities the American Republic should lead the van in the march toward a fairer civilization by throwing her . ports open to the argosies of commerce of the seven seas .

ENGLAND 'S ATTITUDE Harvard University . Cambridge , Mass. , Dec. 27 , 1921 . To the Editor of The New York Times : It may be assumed from the tone of the English press and from other manifestations of English public opinion that the attitude of Lloyd George and of his followers toward . France is approved by the majority of the English people . In commenting upon Ulla attitude such assumption will be made . England is desirous of regaining her pre-war prosperity , and to this legitimate desire no one should take exception . To that end it is necessary that she finds a market for her manufactured products . She contends , probably on good grounds , that she needs the German market . She is consequently desirous that Germany recover her purchasing power . To bring this abeut she urges leniency toward that nation in the matter of indemnity . mode of . payment and penalties . She is grieved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised and indignant that France should be more deeply concerned with her own safety than with England 's commercial prosperity .. For the sake of a speedy improvement of her industrial situation she Is willing to Jeopardize the.security of France , to run the risk even of her destruction and of a new German assault upon Western civilization . France , on the other hand , realizes clearly that in her present mood a prosperous Germany must necessarily mean a dangerous Germany . She knows that unless ? she has the means ? of forcing Germany to live up to the terras of what is left of the Treaty of Versailles . that treaty will be another scrap of paper . She must , therefore , in defense of her very existence , keep up an army of sufficient . size notwithstanding the heavy burden it implies . ' England , however .. would deprive her of that army and therefore of the means of protecting her rights and of opposing the English policy toward Germany . At the same time she refuses to promise protection to France in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France exposed , defenseless , to her unrepentant foe . And who can doubt that France 's military weakness would ' be promptly followed by another attempt to destroy her . England is determined that France will follow her dictates . The French Army stands in her way ; it must be disbanded . In- order to accomplish her aims she does not hesitate to insinuate that France has militaristic ambitions , that she stands in the way of the rehabilitation of Europe , that she Is wrecking the Washington conference . England is making strenuous efforts to enlist on her side the conscience of the civilized world and especially the Conscience of the American people . From the Washington conference England is emerging as the sole victor . She is duplicating here what she accomplished at Versailles . She is allowed a tonnage in capital ships considerably greater than the combined fleets of any two European nations . greater . indeed , than the combined fleets of all European nations . France and Italy could oppose but 350,000 tons to her 500,000 tons . With the German Navy at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be invaded even if all , Europe should combine against her . She is to be congratulated , but can any one find fault if other nations also aspire to live under similar conditions ? Compare , if you please , the security that England enjoys with the lack of security of France and then reflect upon the indifference of England toward France 's safety . England , however , is not satisfied with this absolute certainty that she could not be invaded . She wants in addition the power of invading other nations , not that she has any desire to do so , but because the potential power of invasion gives her the necessary means of compelling other nations to do her bidding and therefore of ruling Europe . Hence ' her war against the submarine , the only defensive weapon left to the other nations against the English Navy . Certainly it is inconceivable to think that England has any desire to make war on France , but she wants the power to force France to folidw her evill in European politics . ' With her navy hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter nation deDrived of her submarines , France must bow and England may rule Europe . Not satisfied ' with her omnipotence of the sea , England wishes France to be Impotent that she may threaten and whip her into line . She *ants her also Impotent on- land that she may not interfere with the treatment that she thinka ought to be applied to Genii-any . If it be admitted that England 's safety demands a-na.vy vastly superior to any other European , navy , can it be denied that France 's safety demands an army vastly superior to any other European army ? Are not the needs of-France more evident and urgent-than those of England ?

The German indemnity , therefore , must be reduced and the terms of payment made easier . France opposes these views . France must be forced to yield . The French Army stands in the way because it gives France the means of forcing the Germans to pay what they owe her , thus impoverishing them . The French Army , therefore . must be reduced . The moral support of the world should be enlisted on the English side by hinting at French militarism . England should rule Europe . She ' should , therefore , have a navy considerably greater than the combined navy-of any two nations . She has it . The invasioa of other nations by ' England should be potentially possible in order that she may rule . To that end the submarine should be abolished . Who can blame France for not falling in heart and soul with this program ? la are told by some that the United States should remain neutral in this disagreement between England and France : : that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aclvices , of Wilson 's proclamation of neutrality in the ? early days of the war . And why should not the United States take sides in this momentous question ? Is it not as clear cut an issue as was the German aggression in 1014 ? Is It not a question of right against might ? The right of France against the might of England ? Does it not involve , like the German war , ' the scrapping ' of a treaty-the scrapping by England of the Treaty of Versailles ? Does not the peace of the world and the future of civilization depend upon the issue of this political warfare ? How then can we remain indifferent to it ? ALBERT SAUVEUR . CONNECTICUT BLUE LAWS New York , Dec. 26 , 1921 . To the Editor of The New York Times : As you say in your issue of the 24th , at least in half a hundred publications It has been asserted that the story of the Blue Laws of Connecticut is a fraud , a myth for which a mendacious clergyman of the Revolutionary period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be true . While a graduate student at Yale . I examined every page of the New England Colonial records which had ever been printed . As a by-product , I set down whatever seemed to bear upon the question of the " Blue Laws , " my attention having been attracted by the accidential discovery of evidence that a certain one of the disputed - laws was actually tame on the statute books. , Finally I read a paper before the Yale Historical Club , and well remember the surprise and interest of the professors of history presentwhen I authenticated one after another of the laws of the Rev. Samuel ' Peters 's famous " abstract , " either as actual statutes or as actual practices of the courts . Afterward. the paper was read before the New Haven Colony Historical Society . In 1898 , at the recommendation of that master of historical criticism , the late Professor Edward G. Bourne , the monograph was accepted and printed by the American Historical Association . And the standard history entitled , " Connecticut as Colony and State , " hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . bases its entire treatment of the subject of the Blue Laws upon that monograph , and with slight exceptions adopts its conclusions . Since no one who has read my study of the matter . whether as found in the report of the American Historical Association or the history of Connecticut . has even attempted to oppose it , and as every prime asserition in it is backed , so to speak , by chapter and verse , it may be said that the matter , which was debated for a hundred years , with Mr. Peters a loser in every round up to 1898 , is settled substantially in his favor , In spite of all his minor inaccuracies . More than one-half of Peters 's " Blue Laws " did exist in the colony of New Haven ' alone . either in the form of express statutes or as judicial customs under the common law . . More than four-fifths of them existed . in the same fashion , in one or more of the colonies of New England . Had they been forgeries , the guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinee he derived nearly two-thirds of , them directly from other writers on New England history , especially Neal 's History of New England , published in 1747 . Peters copied errors made by Neal in abstracting long laws . It ' was shown ' probable that certain of the laws not yet authenticated might be authenticated if we could find more records of the lowest courts , most of which have perished . WALTER F. PRINCE . SWISS EXCHANGE . To the Editor of The New York Times : In your editorial of Sunday last , relatiye to Swiss exbhange , you state " the surprising thing is that the equivalent of gold ( American dollars ) should be at a discount anywhere . " This is indeed surprising except to those who are familiar with European conditions and with the alertness of the minds which direct the national finances of Switzer- land . The rise of Swiss exchange above mint parity has ' not been causad by demand for rernitttances in settlement of an international trade balance favorable to Switzerland , but because the Inland nation . which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discount . is being used as a , sort of safe deposit for outside funds which are seeking shelter from present and prospective ' taxation . This inflow of wealth has caused a plethora of funds which are difficult of investment because they are subject to immediate withdrawal . If Switzerland took gold now she would be forced to pay it out later . when these outside funds are withdrawn-thereby indulging both now and then in unnecessary and costly operations ; hence the Banque Nationale Suisse has expressed its unwillingness to purchase geld ' at the legal price . The action of The Banque Nationale , which sets a precedent in international financing , has caused the commercial price of gold in Switzerland to go to a discount when expressed in terms of Swiss exchange . thereby permitting the Swiss to invest their surplus funds in the yellow metal at a favorable price . Should the near future witness an economic readjustment in Europe . there would immediately follow important withdrawals of funds from Switzerland , with corresponding pressure on Swiss exchange . ' The-premiur ? on Swiss francs would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gold wo rise in equal ratio-thereby insuring a profit to those who purchase the metal at the present depreciated levels . RENE LEON . COAL ECONOMY . To ths Editor of The New York Times : Thirty , years ago I paid $4 a ton for coal trimmed in the cellar . This year I paid $13.75 for coal containing 10 per cent . more slate . Since coal cost more than $12 a ton . I have sifted the ashes ' and have recovered ' sufficient half-burned coal ( cinders ) to supply fuel Stir my ' furnace from March 15 to April 10 . I buy 12 per cent . less coal because I practice this economy . Should coal prices advance , I will use no coal , but mill , Install an ? oil burner in my heater . A. X.T. I New York ; Dec. 27 , , 1931. r ' FRIENDLY MEMORIES Thoughts of an Old Reader Upon Perusing Last Sunday 's Times It happened Sunday morning last that the writer , over his eggs and rolls at anear-by restaurant , overheard two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful paper , " one man remarked . " Sure is , " the other agreed . " Between the news and the picture supplement and all the other special features you get everything there is going . " " Everything there is going " -a sweeping generalization , to be sure , but to the writer . who has lived his threescore years in many different environments and has been a daily reader of THE TIMES for . more years than he cares to enumerate , not nearly so sweeping as it might be , for THE TIMES also brings back many things long since gone . Perusing my own copy of THE TIMES . Sunday issue , I stumbled across the headline " Heirs of Princess Ask Fortune Back . " A column of story followed-a romance in which a German Prince ; zu Ly-nars , abetted by William I. , pursued an American girl to her home in Columbus and married her there In May , 18711 I was a child at the time of this wedding , which took place at the Episcopal church only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populace , anxious to catch sight of a real Paince and his bride ; the mob that crazily stormed the approaches to the church and gave the police much trouble to protect the wedding party ; the Prince himself , in what we imagined the most wonderful uniform in the world-all this , though long since retired to the limbo of forgotten things , came back through Tan Trams article as vividly as though it happened but yesterday . Further along in this same issue of THE TIMES another headline commanded attention : " Through the Shadows with 0 . Henry . " It was news to me that Americas most famous short story writer since the days of Poe had spent four years in the Ohio State Penitentiary ' at Columbus . Here again THE TIMES registered on a nerve-centre. for 1 in my youth gathered up a few Dark Shadows on my own account under the grim walls of that same penal institution . the principal difference being that otuat .. as on the outside of the wall looking in , while 0 .. Henry was inside looking The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital lay along the prison wall , but oatside . We were doing a splendid business in supplying the United States as well as foreign countries with a specialty for interior decoration . Our wood carvers , of whom we employed several . were among the best paid labor of the day , averaging $15 per diem . Marshall Field offered us a ten-year contract for our entire output , but my partner and myself both happened to be individualists , so we declined . A few months later the Germans invaded the- country with a cheap but artistic substitute for our seecialty ; our market was lost ; we were forced to junk our fine little plant ; a large quantity of fine walnut lumber that had cost us dose to $90 per thousand feet , we sold for $3h per thousand . Tbe clean-up left us with all bills paid but with little more than the shirts on our backs . History repeats itself . Many a manufacturer in this country is bound to go through i the same experience if steps are not taken promptly to protect oursalves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to- day . Under the guise of salesmen they penetrate - business offices and factories , less with the idea of making sales than to obtain exact information available later for trade penetration based on their , no doubt purposely to a large extent , depreciated mark . The Other day a caller at my office stated that he had just . heard from a mutual acquaintance , a German-American , who had returned to Germany . This man wrote that he had recently visited a country town and stopped at a hotel . His bill for meals and a night 's lodging , although in marks , represented fifteen cents in American money , An extra , for which the hotel apologized , amounted to one cent , American . The question is : Are we going to permit Germany to flood us with products manufactured on the present basis of the mark ? If not , it is time we sat up and took notice . , One more of the trails which last Sunday 's issue of THE TIMES caused me to cross , and I will call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran across a full-page review of a book by a wellknown naturalist . The author-f -- of the book . not the review-I happened to . know . was a close friend of the late Theodore Roosevelt . This author happened to be visiting his famous friend late in the Fall when a film of ice had already formed along the shores of Oyster Bay . The house being filled with gueste , the author in Question was invited to sleep with his host . At daylight next morning a colored attendant aroused the sleepers : it was time for the Colonel 's swim . " Teddy " invited his author-friend to join him and had other of his guests aroused that they might " come along , " but one sniff of the snappy morning air was enough for the others . The author proved the only guest game for the ordeal . Together they marched down to the bay , together they broke the ice . took their plunge , and came back to be rubbed down . Visiting the Colonel was not for those seeking the . comfort of perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of the Colonel at a time ? when , if ever a human face registered disgust , it was his . On the day of the Dewey parade I descended from the Sixth Avenue elevated at Fourteenth Street . The back-wash-of the parade was straggling up the avenue , homeward bound , and here came the then Governor , Roosevelt . riding at the head of his guard . If there is anything on earth more ridiculous for equestrian pursuits than the black frock coat and silk hat prescribed for our dignitaries on formal occasions , it is beyond the writer 's ken . If ever a man looked unhappy it was Theodore Roosevelt on this occasion . The . glamour of : bands and shouts of the populace were gone . It was a broiling hot day , Roosevelt was mounted on a big horse , his face , beaded with perspiration , was fiery red from a day of exposure to a blistering sun , and , as his silk hat bobbed along up the avenue under the , " L " and disappeared .

W. H. THE FARMER 'S TROUBLES Vincennes . Ind. , Dec. 24 , 1921 . To the Editor of The New York Times : The attached clipping from your issue of Dec. 22 ' - headed , " Pay Back Seed Loans , But Farmers Are in Straits Again . Federal Report Says , " is directed to my attention . Let 's let the light in on . this subject . The situation with respect to the North Dakota farmers is analogous to the conditions which confront 14,000,000 farmers and dependents in pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done before another year passes to bring them relief , they will be dependent upon charity . for sustenance . The exact trouble . with the North Dakota farmers is that , in addition to a partial crop failure . they did not receive enough for their products to pay for the coat of producing them . In the corn belt The corn crop is selling for from 15 cents to 35 cents per bushel , and the crop cost is from 60 cents to 90 cents to grow it . And , Mr. Editor , when you tell me thab this is an economic condition which can not be regulated , I wish you at the eame time to tell me why it is that rail transportation rates are not affected by the same general economic conditional and why railway Workers are not receiving pay in line with the same general econonac conditions . And also why coal miners in the central competitive field are working an average of one or two days a week  --  and are able to live on their earnings while the public is paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been destroyed , and the great purchasing power , which is the measure : of our national prosperity , has been so depleted that there is no hope for a return to normalcy " until there has been a ' leveling down to the values of faam products or a lifting up of the farm product values , to the level of comthodity prices . ' Do not be deceived by the propaganda statements that there is no export demand to take up the surplus , because a little ' investigating will disclose that we have exported more wheat this year than In any other year , and with a proper organization to take care of our farm export business we could be feeding a starving world out of producta which are being wasted and destroyed in our midst . There are thousands of , farmers in America who have grown scrod crops this year and who have not earned a , fair wage-have not earned enough to pay the interest on their mortgage and ? the taxes on their land . It is common knowledge that there are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the last twenty years . The Federal Reserve banking system has earned something over 100 per cent . this year . Ninety per cent . of the banks of the country have had an unusually -- successful year . ' The Burlington Railroad has earned enough money to pay the dividends on its own stock and a . Surplus to- help its owners take care of theirs . And agriculture , the greatest of all businesses . the one upon which the whole country depends for its prosperity , is down and out and bankrupt , There are those who live by the tape . who would believe that prosperity is just over - yonder hill , and that it can ' be cajoled into coming over into our country by . subtle advertising methods , as practiced bY the New York Rotary Club , which is wasting $60,000 that could better be spent in relieving- suffering- in the world than by making of itself a laughing stock ? for men of serious mind who know the fundamental causes of our economic depression .
