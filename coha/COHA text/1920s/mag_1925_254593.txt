J. Frederick Essary is Washington correspondent of The Baltimore Sun . Recently , he traveled south to Asheville , N. C , where the Southern Newspaper Publisher 's Association was holding its annual convention . He went a knight from the Faery Queen to cleave off the ghastly head of rumor and of scandal . Said he : <P> " I wish that straight news-legitimate news-were the only product which proceeds from Washington , but I know that it is not , just as you know it . The Capital is the great germinator of gossip and of scandalous whisperings regarding the great and the near great . . . . <P> " For some reason wholly mysterious to me , more stories of an amazing character were told and believed regarding Woodrow Wilson than any other great American of my time . There has perhaps never been in Washington a high public official more rigid in his personal rectitude than the man now dead . . . . One of the most absurd of these rumors was to the effect that he had become violently insane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of mine from out of town walked with me past the White House . He told me what he had heard regarding the insanity of the President , but said that he had refused to believe a word of it until there had been pointed out to him a bedroom in the northeast corner of the house across the window of which iron bars had been placed . He solemnly directed my attention to these bars , undeniable evidence to his mind of the truth of the insanity story . . . . <P> " Those bars , I told him , had been across those windows since the days of Theodore Roosevelt . They were placed there when the Roosevelts made a nursery of the room and for the sole purpose of keeping the energetic young Roosevelt boys from precipitating themselves to their death on the concrete pavement below . I hated to spoil a good story , but what else was one to do ? <P> " As for the Harding White House parties , they were innocence itself . The late President was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate friends about him . And he loved a friendly game of draw poker . He played it not because there might be a little money involved . He played it because it was a form of relaxation which he most enjoyed . He played it as some people play bridge , or dominoes , or chess , or croquet . He played it without secrecy or apology . And he played it often and sometimes late . And yet these quiet little games have been made to appear , in some minds , as scandalous orgies staged in the official home of the very head of the Government itself . "
