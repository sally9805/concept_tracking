The Masks of the Devil . Author Henry James in parentheses , Playwright Eugene O'Neill in asides , made their characters utter their real thoughts during conventional dialog , a device awkward in fiction or on the stage but natural and effective in the many pictures which have contained hints of it . Used here to great extent , the trick adds interest to Jacob Wassermann 's short story about the Baron ( John Gilbert ) who has the face of an archangel , the soul of a devil , and a lust for the fiancee ( Eva Von Berne ) of his friend . In an effort to live up to his reputation as the greatest lover in Hollywood , John Gilbert makes his eyes pop out and his chest heave in a way that little furthers his ambition to be also its greatest actor . <P> John Gilbert has been connected with the theatre all his life . With his mother , an actress , he grew up in road-shows , later filled inkwells for a San Francisco rubber company , played in stock and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his first big part ( Heart of the Hills ) . In 1918 he married a girl who put on an act in his base-camp ; later they were divorced . He married Leatrice Joy in 1921 ; they were divorced . He has a 92-ft. schooner called The Temptress , drives a Packard , plays tennis fairly well , golf badly , is careful with his money and reads Shakespeare . He dislikes romantic roles and thinks the best picture he ever played in was The Big Parade . <P> <P> The Viking . Although the odd , no-colored daylight of the camera suggests , by the contrast of shadows , all colors , producers have always been dissatisfied with this virtue of their medium just as with the swift possibilities of its silence . Past experiments with color have been unsatisfactory principally because colors did not reproduce exactly ; in this tinted drama involving an English slave and a Viking Princess , the old trouble continues - blue is not blue , brown not brown . Melodramatic episodes of Norse swordplay , and voyaging ships give an old-fashioned atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were more intelligently directed . Best shot : the discoverer of America* going ashore at Newport , R. I. <P> The Somme , made with the co-operation of the British Army Council , is a war picture without plot , a rapid newsreel of the fighting that went on in the mud and rain in 1916 and 1917 . Unlike those recent films of battle in which the courage and good-nature of the protagonists made war seem a rather admirable , phenomenal cradle of heroes , The Somme is full of death and terror , last cigarets puffed on the ground , bodies , the conquered and the conquering , piled indifferently together . Best shot : a lonely piper , making death musical for a Canadian regiment .
