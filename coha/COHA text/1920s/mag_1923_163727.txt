Lord Grey of Fallodon unveiled a memorial in Westminster Abbey to the late Walter Hines Page , war-time U. S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James . A large crowd of dignitaries attended the impressive ceremony . <P> Lord Grey : " It is most fitting that this memorial should be in Westminster Abbey , the shrine of so much that is great , honorable and dear in our history , which , not so very long ago , as time is reckoned , was as much a part of his ancestry as our own . " <P> After a special prayer , The Battle Hymn of the Republic was sung for probably the first time within those ancient walls , followed by God Save the King and My Country ' T is of Thee . <P> Mrs. Page , Arthur W. Page and wife , the Ambassador 's daughter , Mrs. Loring , and his three grandchildren were present . <P> The Times : " On an appropriate morning , since this is Independence Day , the English speaking public of two hemispheres will read of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of the great American Ambassador . . . . There is a date of supreme importance to the calendar of Anglo-Sax-ondom more recent than that of Independence Day , and it is that one on which America entered the War and threw herself into the struggle for right and justice . " <P> The Morning Post : " As long as the story of the great War is told the name of Walter Hines Page will be recalled with honor and affection in this country . Whatever changes time may bring , it will never invalidate his claim to a niche in the Abbey . " <P> Mr. Page 's memorial is the third to be erected to an United States ' citizen , the others being to Longfellow and Lowell.
