As the sleek French packet Amiral Pierre steamed southward through the Mediterannean last week her first cabin passengers regarded with awe a squat , hawk-beaked Moroccan with a short bristling black beard who appeared now and then on deck always accompanied by two armed French guards . Spain and France had poured out hundreds of millions in gold , and tens of thousands in lives to place the sardonic Moroccan with his brother , their wives and suite upon the Amiral Pierre . Not six months ago Mohammed ben Abd-el-Krim and his brother Muhammed were holding the Riffian fastnesses of Morocco against that master strategist Marshal Petain and the best of Spain 's ( TIME , June 7 ) , after two years of junta-ridden generals . Though they surrendered at last to the French valorous resistance , both Mohammed ben Abd-el-Krim and his brother may still boast that they go to the life exile at Reunion* Island vouchsafed to them by France ( TIME , July 26 ) , without ever surrendering to Spain . <P> Before the Amiral Pierre sailed from Marseilles for Reunion , Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish+ the story of his feud with Spain : <P> " One blow from a Spanish fist transformed me into what I shall always be-the foe of Spain . . . . <P> " It was in 1919 that I called upon General Silvestre of the Spanish Army at Mellila in the interest of my tribe , the Beni Uriaghel , who wanted 100,000 pesetas ( $15,000 ) to keep the peace that year with the Spanish . This was the custom of the strong Moroccan tribes at that time . The Spaniards have many times bought peace . <P> " When I suggested the sum of 100,000 pesetas General Silvestre flew into a raging fury . He cried that I was a robber . Then , before I knew what he was doing he struck me full in the face . The blow was so unexpected and so powerful that it knocked me to the ground . I fell , bleeding from the mouth . What could I do ? There were Spanish soldiers everywhere . I had only a handful of my tribe with me . I only staggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within me there was kindled in that moment a terrific hatred of Silvestre and all Spaniards . As I rose I swore that I would avenge that blow a thousand times . I went back committed to lead my tribe and all the other tribes I could enlist in a ceaseless war against the Spaniards . For over five years I kept that oath . Spain can judge whether Silvestre 's brutality was avenged .
