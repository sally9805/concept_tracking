 | UNLESS we are constantly upon our guard in the household , we are beset by insect pests which are a menace to health and valuable , ossessions . The fly , the cockroach , the mosquito , the bedbug , and the flea have much to answer for in the way of pollution and the spread of disease , and moths , weevils , book lice , mice , and rats are exceedingly destructive . Some of them also have been convicted of the charge of being carriers of dangerous germs . Safety first and then self-respect call for the extermination of all intruders , and the sooner and the more energetically the campaign is carried on , the less there will be to do . Some people are more sensitive to the bites and stings of insects than others , but children are especially susceptible and are often made decidedly ill and develop an annoying rash caused by the poisons injected into their blood . The discomfort of the intense itching is usually relieved by bathing in a solution of cool soda and water , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal quantity of water , or by applying a cooling ointment containing menthol . Naturally , prevent ion is the best means of all of keeping clear of any of these insect annoyances . Prevention consists of absolute cleanliness , thorough screening , and the stopping up of all avenues of entrance . Even when doors and windows are protected with small-meshed screens , flying things may enter by the way of the chimney , if there is a fireplace , or through unprotected attic ventilators or cellar windows . It is not a difficult matter to have a metal screen fitted to the top of the chimney and put in place . during the summer , or , if it is more convenient , a fireplace screen may be made with little trouble and expense . Hinged screens for cellar windows are satisfactory , and attic windows of irregular or ornamental shape can have screening tacked'over them on the inside , or a large , flat screen hung from above like a storm window . It is the neglect of these practical details which often accounts for trouble when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , the family cat or dog has brought fleas into the house , which have found a pleasant habitation in the nap of your favorite carpet , vacuum-clean it thoroughly , close up the room , and place a fresh sheet of sticky fly-paper in the middle of the floor with a little chunk of fresh meat in the middle . Or , if you wish , you can cut the sticky fly-paper into quarters and put them in different locations in the room with the bait in the middle of each . Fleas are attracted by the odor of the fresh meat and will jump to reach it . If the flypaper is large enough so that they do not make the island of food at a single bound , they will be caught in the sea of the sticky surface about it . A few days of this treatment will be sufficient to catch them all . In the meantime , give the dog or cat a thorough bath with synol or carbolic soap . Use a rather fine-toothed comb gently to straighten out the hair and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed or sleeping places thoroughly , otherwise the animal will be reinfested every night . One of the most troublesome pests which the housewife has to fight is the cockroach , water-bug , or crotonbug . This is a particularly filthy insect which runs over food wherever it finds it . The odor which it leaves behind is due to the secretions of the abdominal glands and the saliva , both of which are smeared over everything with which it comes in contact . Cockroaches also eat the bindings of books . They are wary insects and come out only when it is dark . As they are furnished with antennae something like a wireless , they hear the slightest noise . Their flat bodies permit them to creep into all sorts of cracks and crevices . These should be closed up as nearly as possible , and all food materials kept tightly closed . There are roach traps which are baited with a piece of cheese or other odorous food , which will catch a good many of them . Borax has been experimented with successfully as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract them , but if the powder is freely sprinkled about for two or three weeks , it will be efficacious in ridding the premises of them . The U. S. Department of Agriculture has experimented extensively in exterminating roaches and has found that sodium fluoride is especially efficient . It is poisonous to human beings as well as to the bugs , and so must be used with caution . The usual way to use it is to mix equal parts of it with rice or wheat flour , the flour to act as a bait . It is then scattered about their haunts . It must be brushed up and renewed frequently , because when it becomes damp from the air , they will not touch it . Powdered sulfur is also disliked by them . Houses may be entirely rid of all bug pests by the use of hydrocyanic gas , the fumes of which will reach into all of the crevices and destroy the insects . But it should be remembered that this gas is a deadly poison , and that the process should be undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows just how to do the work . The house should be vacated and nickel a nd brass objects removed or heavily covered . Food-stuffs should be removed . The operator should begin at the top of the house and work down , and the great est of care should be taken that doors are locked so that no one can possibly enter . If the house is in a block , examination should be made that the gas may not pen etrate to other occupied portions . Some drug-stores make a specialty of this service . When the housewife is moving into a new location , she may be suspicious that the house is infested with crotonbugs or bed-bugs . In that case , she will do well to require the landlord to guarantee the premises vermin-free . Many localities have firms which advertise extensively to keep houses clean of all vermin . If it is necessary to wage the war individually , it can be done , but ev erything which will call or attract them must be cleaned up or eliminated . There must be no greasy dish-cloths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy hunting grounds for the cockroach . The o l d - f a s h i o n e d e n c l o s e d plumbing was espe cially favorable for them . Pure Dalmation ( unadulterated ) or 1'y rethrum insect powder is also helpful in getting rid of them . A preparation which depends in part upon the Dalmation powder is made as follows : Insect powder 8 ounces Powdered borax .... 8 ounces Quicklime 2 ounces Sulfur 2 ounces Oil of eucalyptus. . .4 drams Mix well and scatter where the insects will get it . With a small insect or force gun force it into the crevices they haunt . The fact that roaches disappear for a while is no sign that they are all gone , for some day a crop of little ones may appear . This is the time that the fight must be waged actively , or these newcomers will in turn become the forefathers of a large and thrifty progeny . Even when the greatest of care is exercised by the housewife , she will sometimes see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her in a basket from the grocery store or with some vegetables from market . It is well to look all these things over before they are put away . Buffalo bugs , or carpet beetles , are especially partial to woolens and are said to select with avidity anything dyed red . They receive their name because they are covered with a shaggy coat of black hair , causing them , under the microscope , to look something like a tiny buffalo . The bug eventually develops into a small beetle marked with black , scarlet , and white . Many families have gone away for the summer , leaving their homes apparently in order , only to come back and find the carpets ruined by these destroying insects . They usually work  | around the edges during warm weather . Rugs are much easier to keep free from them than ! carpets which are fastened in place , and they seldom trouble when a strong vacuum cleaner is used . All cracks in the floor should be filled with crack-filler , for here is where they lodge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . If there are any traces of the insects , the carpet should be taken out and thoroughly beaten , and if a steam cleaning process is available , this will be useful . If not , spread the carpet out smoothly upon an unfinished floor , and take a cloth about a yard square which has been wrung out of a solution of two tablespoonfuls of spirits of turpentine to each quart of hot water . Place this over a section of the carpet and with a hot iron press until dry . Repeat this until the whole surface has been gone over . The steam will kill the grubs and larvae . Either the hydrocyanic acid gas or the sulfur fumes are effective , also , for this pest , but at least two pounds of sulfur to each thousand cubic feet of space should be used . The carpet should be taken up from the floor and stretched over chairs , so that the fumes may reach all parts equally . If the carpet can be stretched out of doors , it can be saturated with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain . Newspapers laid under the rugs or carpets are a prevention . The buffalo beetle dearly loves expensive woolen clothing and furs . Beat and clean the clothes , and if necessary , send them to be steam cleaned . If they do not require this , pack the articles away in a perfectly tight trunk or box with plenty of napthalene balls , fine tobacco , or insect powder . Furs are faded by being brought in contact with camphor preparations , so tobacco , cayenne pepper , or a good insect powder are more desirable . Formaldehyde fumigation has also proved valuable to clear a room of buffalo bugs . Moth Larva Do the Damage Moths are one of the most feared of the household pests . It is not the moth itself which does the harm , but the larvae . The larva hatch out from the eggs and feed on anything composed of animal tissue , such as furs , feathers , or wool . Vegetable tissue , like cotton , is not pleasing to them . The best remedy of all is prevention . Follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is the moth which lays the eggs . Keep the windows screened in the summer time . See to it that all closets where woolens and furs are stored are kept perfectly clean , and the cracks filled up . Do not put furs or woolens away until they are clean , for it is the soiled spots which are always eaten . A moth-proof cedar chest is a good investment . If it is not possible to possess one of these . collect some red cedar cigar boxes , split them up into small pieces , and these , with a bag of red cedar shavings or chips , will do nicely . Use a perfectly tight trunk or packing case for storing away furs and woolen materials through the summer , and scatter camphor or napthalene balls , or use the red cedar shavings or pieces . Some of the largest fur houses in the country depend wholly upon the beating process , employing men who do this sort of work week in and week out , taking in turn the furs which aggregate millions in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below forty degrees Fahrenheit , so cold storage is an excellent preventive . Furs look better for being held in cold storage during the summer , as a low temperature is their native element and helps to restore their glossiness . One very simple way of caring for furs or expensive woolens is to clean them thoroughly , lay them in the common , pasteboard suit-  | boxes , and paste strips of cloth or heavy paper securely over the edges , completely sealing the container . The various moth-proof , tartreated bags are also good , provided the materials are perfectly clean IN hen put away . Upholstered furniture infested with moths may be freed from them by the gasoline treatment . It will be necessary to take the article out of doors and saturate it , allowing it to stand until the gasoline has evaporated . Or . if the nature of the article permits , use a full strength formaldehyde solution in the crevices and around the under parts of the furniture . Use this out of doors , as the fumes are irritating . After twenty-four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome in the summer anti often make their appearance in great numbers . If one finds a treasure house sugar , sirup ; milk , meat , or animal food , will warn the rest , who will come in large numbers , for they soon establish an odorous trail which all the rest can follow . If possible , locate the nest and destroy it with boiling water . Kerosene or turpentine may be added to this , and quicklime is useful to sprinkle their haunts . Red ants dislike powdered cloves , and all of them can be driven away by camphor . Where possible to use it , the Following ant exterminator has been successful : Borax ounces Powdered camphor. 2 drams Powdered cloves .... a drams Mix and scatter about . In some cities it is possible to obtain a prepared ant tape , which really consists of cotton tape soaked in a solution of corrosive sublimate . This is wound around the legs of tables , food safes , or refrigerators . Ants will not cross these strips of tape . The directions given for preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a granite-ware vessel , which be unchipped . Add all the water that it will take up , that is , until every particle of the poison is dissolved . Soak the tape in this ant . hang it up to dry . It will remain active for a year . Do not allow the solution or the tape to come in contact with iron , tin , or steel .
