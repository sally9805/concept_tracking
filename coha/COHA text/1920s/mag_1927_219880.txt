To what extent may states regulate business ? Last week , the U. S. Supreme Court , in a five to four decision , ruled that states can regulate only businesses involving public utilities or morals , that theatre ticket scalping* does not come under either of these classifications , that the New York law limiting scalpers ' charges to 50c in advance of the rate printed on the face of the ticket is unconstitutional . This decision reversed a lower court opinion and ended the case of Tyson &; Brother , United Theatre Ticket Offices , Inc. v. New York State officials . <P> Majority Opinion . Associate Justice Sutherland handed down the majority opinion , assented to by Chief Justice Taft and Associate Justices Butler , McReynolds , Van Devanter . He wrote : " A theatre is a private enterprise which , in its relation to the public , differs , obviously , widely , both in character and degree , from a grain elevator standing at the gateway of commerce and exacting toll . . . . Sales of theatre tickets bear no relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , certainly , a place of entertainment is in no legal sense a public utility ; and , quite as certainly , its activities are not such that their enjoyment can be regarded under any conditions from the point of view of an emergency . ... A theatre , of course , may be regulated so as to preserve the public peace , insure good order , protect public morals and the like . " <P> Dissenting Opinion . Associate Justices Holmes , Brandeis , Sanford and Stone dissented . With brief eloquence Mr. Holmes , 86 , * wrote : " We fear to grant power and are unwilling to recognize it when it exists . . . . The truth seems to me to be that , subject to compensation when compensation is due , the legislature may forbid or restrict any business when it has a sufficient force of public opinion behind it . Lotteries were thought useful adjuncts of the State a century or so ago ; now they are believed to be immoral and they have been stopped . Wine has been thought good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when public opinion changed it did not need the 18th Amendment , not withstanding the 14th , to enable a State to say that the business should end . What has happened to lotteries and wine might happen to theatres in some moral storm of the future . . . . <P> " But if we are to yield to fashionable conventions , it seems to me that the theatres are as much devoted to public use as anything well can be . ... I am far from saying that I think this particular law a wise and rational provision . That is not my affair . But if the people of the State of New York speaking by their authorized voice say that they want it , I see nothing in the Constitution of the United States to prevent their having their will . " + <P> Specific Effects . Scalpers are now free to charge any price they wish for theatre tickets ; but the larger Manhattan agencies immediately announced that they would stick to the 50c fee , " unless the demand for tickets develops into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have been conducting a surreptitious business since 1922 , rubbed their palms and cheered the five black-robed justices , of whom they had probably never heard before last week . Broadway producers and managers sought to reach an agreement to combat any renewed scalping activity .
