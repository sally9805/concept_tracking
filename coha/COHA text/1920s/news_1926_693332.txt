txt The defense In the oil conspiracy trial of Albert B. Fall , former Secretary of the Interior , and Edward L. Doheny , California oil operator , opened their case today , calling as . their principal witness Dr. H. Foster Bain , who was Director of the Bureau of Mines of the Interior Department when the Pearl Harbor ( Ha-. waii ) contract and the Elk Hills ( Cal. ) naval oil leases were negotiated . He testified that Mr. Fall knew nothing about the Pearl Harbor project until 11 the plans and specifications , drawn up in the Navy Department , were submit ' ted to him weeks after the proposition I was developed by the General Board of the navy . Dr. Bain further testified that the Elk Hills lease was brought about not by Mr. Fall alone but with the cooperation of various officials of the Interior and Navy Departments . Before Dr. Bain was called to the Stand Wilton J. Lambert made an opening statement to the jury on behalf of Mr. Fall , asserting that before the defense rests Its case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominating figure in the Elk Hills and Pearl Harbor projects that he has been painted by the prosecution . Also Mr. Lambert declared that it would be shown there had been no criminal conspiracy to defraud the Government , is alleged In the indictment , but that the controlling issue Svaii Patriotic in nature add the continuation of a policy of conservation that " runs like a gold thread " throughout the entire course of Mr. Fall 's official life . Frank J. Hogan some days ago made his opening statement for Mr. Doheny . Prosecution Goes Back to Loan . The Government rested'its case within an hour after the court convened today , the- last prosecution witness being Senator Thomas J : Walsh , Senate committee " prosecutor " in the oil inquiry , who swore to the " genuineness of correspondence , involving the $100 , - 000 feature of the case , which had passed between Mr. Fall and himself . Senator Walsh had written Mr. Fall offering him the opportunity to explain the letter , in which it was stated that Mr. was the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reply Mr. Fall did not disclose the sources of the money , but did say he had not obtained It from H. F Sinclair or any other person intdrested in oil Concessions . It was this last statement the Government was moil anxious to get before the jury . Dr , Bain was subjected to a severe eaclOination by Owen J. Roberts of Government counsel . He fired his questions at the witness with machine gun speed . Dr. Bain was asked if he did not recall Mr. Fall telling him that Mr. ' Doheny would submit a bid in the Pearl Harbor transaction . Dr. pain said he did not , whereupon Mr. Roberts read from the report of Dr. Bain 's examination in the suit to cancel the Elk Hills lease , at Los Angeles , in which he was recorded as having answered the question in the affirmative . Dr. Bain said he did not remember so testifying , but that if it was in the minutes he probably said it He insisted , however , he did not remember it now . ? It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that plan was abandoned and Justice Hoehling announced that it was because of the " condition of the defendants . " Mr. Lambert said tonight that there was nothing serious the matter with either of the defendants . Mr. Doheny , he indicated , was suffering tiring the afternoon session from indigestion . On the other hand , Mr. Fall , he added , was in fine fettle , despite the fact that he appears to have aged ten years since he left the Cabinet . When court convened Mr. Roberts of Government counsel called as his last witness Senator Walsh , who testified regarding two letters that had passed between Mr. Fall and himself , which related to the $100,000 it was subsequently shown Mr. Fall obtained from Mr. Doheny . The prosecution had the Fall letter , but not the original Walsh letter to which it was a reply . ? Senator Walsh testified that the copy was a bona fide copy of the letter he had written , and Justice Hoe ding , after noting the exceptions of the defense , ruled that both the Fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Walsh had addressed his communication to Mr. Fall on Jan. 11 , 1923 , immediately at the conclusion of the Senate committee examination at Palm Beach , Fla. , of Edward B. , in the course of which Mr. bad admitted that the statement that he had lent Mr. Fall the $100,000 was untrue . In the letter Senator Walsh informed Mr. Fall that he had examined Mr. and that the latter had told him that while he had at one time given checks totaling $100,000 to Mr. Fall , the checks had not been cashed , but had been returned to him by Mr. Fall . Senator Walsh wrote Mr. Fall that in view of these developments . which soon thereafter culminated in Mr. Doheny 's disclosure of himself as the person from whom the money was obtained , he would be glad to give Mr. Fall a chance to be heard in persons or , if that was not possible , to have a statement in writing , which be would file with the Senate oil investigating committee . In his reply Mr. Fall corroborated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not say from whom he had received the $100,000 . He did , however , declare that it did not come from H. F. Sinclair or any other person involved in the oil concessions . Fall 's Letter to Walsh . The letter follows : Palm Beach , Fla. , Jan. 11 , 1924 . Senator Thomas F. Walsh , Breakers Hotel , Palm Beach , Fla . Dear Sir : I am in receipt of your communication of this date , advising me that after the taking of Mr. 's deposition today you are ready , under the authority granted you by the committee , to take any statement that I might desire to make or to accept from me any subsequent written statement from me to the committee . I desire to advise you that I have carefully read the testimony which Mr. gave today and that I endorse the accuracy of same . I will also say that before giving his testimony Mr. had a conference with me , and I told him that , so far as I was concerned , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection I will say that it is absolutely true that I did not finally use the money from Mr. , which he expressed himself willing to give me , because I found that I could readily obtain it from other sources . I wish It thoroughly understood that the source from which I obtained the money which I used was in no way connected with Mr. Sinclair or in any way involved in any concession regarding the Teapot Dome or any other oil concession . Further than this I would not care to go at the present time , inasmuch as I am not in anything like the physical condition to stand the ordeal of an examination . It may be , though , that I will decide to am ' plify this statement to you for the committee at a later date . Very truly yours , ALBERT B. FALL . Mr. Roberts then placed in evidence various lease contracts , with which the Doheny interests were not identified , the purpose being to show that in other leases the Government received more favorable terms in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company . LAMBERT OPENS FOR FALL . This over with , the Government rested its case , and Wilton J. Lambert of counsel for Mr. Fall made his opening address to the jury in behalf of that defendant . Mr. Hogan some days ago rendered the same service for Mr. Doheny . " I feel , " said Mr. Lambert , " that we could practically leave this case with the testimony that has flowed into it from the showing promised you by Mr. Hogan , without going further , and with perfect confidence for the defendants ; but I feel that we must give you every bit of light that we have . whether it be supplemental or in addition , so that while you have here records produced and testimony from Government officials , I want to tell you that there are other records which supplement and clarify the situation , which we are going to show you . " I want to tell you that there are other Government officials whose presence here physically on the stand we will present to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clear as any that has gone before in the interests of the defendants . " Mr. Lambert . at this point indicated that many witnesses would be called by the defense , but he named only Iwo , Rear Admiral John K. Robinson , who was head of the Bureau of Engineering in the Navy Department and H. Foster Bain . who was head of the Bureau of Mines in the Interior Department at the time of the leasing transactions . Mr. Lambert put emphasis on the intention of the defense to prove that Mr. Fall was absent from Washington over long periods while the contracts and leases were being negotiated and that this being so , a great deal of the work was done by other officials of the Government . Recalls Order From Denby . " On Oct. 8 , 1922 , Secretary Fall left Washington . " Mr. Lambert continued , " and did not return until Nov. 27. 1922 , just two days before there came into being and into the department the famous letter which you have had referred to here , which we win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our evidence , the famous letter of Nov. 29 , 1922 , which came from the pen and department of Secretary Denby of the Navy , and which changed the whole aspect of the situation , and was , we will show you , a direction from the Secretary of the Navy , with the concurrence of the President of the United States as we will show to you , to proceed with the very policy which crystallized in the Contract and lease of Dec. 11 , 1922. a tea , days after Mr. Fall had been away ar , ee Oct. 8 of that year . " We will show you that he had practically nothing in the world to do with that excepting to do his duty to the Administration and the Navy Department to carry out their wishes , and that letter of Nov. 29 from the Navy Department you will probably recall , and we will show you more definitely again it was considered of such importance that it is made part and parcel of and placed within the contract or lease of Dec. lip 1922 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that Secretary Fall took over the portfolio of the Interior he had but one policy , and it runs like a thread of gold throughout the entire course of his official life in that department , and that was that he wanted to conserve in the ground of the territory owned by the United States every particle of oil and gas that could be kept there . Through every letter which we will show you that will be his evidence . " That policy was never changed , we will show you , by him . He had but one exception to this determination to that conclusion , and that exception was where he found extant a situation where private owners over whom lise " had no control . we will show you , were on the edge , draining as one neighbor would drain the well of another and leave nothing for the other but a dry hole . Says Fall Policy Was Best . " So Secretary Fall , we will show you , conserved in every order that he made and every recommendation that he gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it was In some of those sections , that the Standard Oil or the Pacific Oil or the Associated Oil companies , or what not , were on the edge of that dividing line , were at a particular well and taking from the other side what the Government was entitled to . " Nothing to do with what gave birth to the leases that have been so stressed here , and it was on account of that alone that those wells , we will show you , were allowed to be drilled , because , we will show you , it was far better in his policy to conserve the oil when they could get it from the ground than to awaken to a situation of the need for the oil and find none existing . " You will note , we will show you further by the evidence , that not a single one of these departures from that policy were made by Secretary Fall except on the lines where danger threatened to the Government 's property . True , there was some change in the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find existing in any policy relative thereto , we will show you , was when Secretary Fall was far away from here , without his knowledge , put into effect by the Acting Secretary of the Interior . " Prior to the letter of Nov. 29 , the evidence will show you that there came an occasion when Secretary Fall turned everything in connection with this matter over to the Department of the Navy , and did it at the very time that his old friend , the defendant Doheny , they say was rapping at the door for the concessions in regard tcn ? leases . Then you will remember the letter of Mr. Doheny , and we will supplement that to show that so far from following this matter up on behalf of Fall , he said he was going away and could not attend to this , and suggested that Fall leave it to somebody else if he was going away . Fall-left everything , we will show you , from start to finish , in the hands of the Department of the Navy , which was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambert declared he would show that not one extension , change or detail of the oil transactions was carried on by Mr. Fall , and he added that in other instances it would be just as conclusively shown that Mr. Fall not only did not exercise a dominant Influence but that he knew nothing about what was done until after it was consummated . Turns , to the $100,000 Loan . Then he took up the $100,000 transaction between Fall and Doheny . " Having had nothing to do with the lease of Nov. 11 , " continued Mr. Lambert , referring to the Elk Hills lease , " we will show you that nothing can be attached in the line of conspiracy to the facts in this case ; not even can they raise the ghost of the 5100 , - 00 loan to make a situation that would make a prima facie illustration of conspiracy . " We will show you there that for forty years Albert Fall and Edward Doheny had been old-time associates in prosperity and adversity . The evidence will show you that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business with the department or otherwise , but that underlying the entire conditions was a forty-two-year friendship , and such a friendship as that , we , will show you , no man could be considered to have red blood in his veins that would be unmindful of the other 's vicissitudes . " Mr. Lambert traced Mr. Fall 's political career from the time he began the practice of law in New Mexico until the time he became Secretary of the Interior in the Cabinet of President Harding . But for the persistent urging of President Harding , Mr. Fall , he declared , would not have been in the Cabinet in April , 1922 . " His honor , " concluded Mr. Lambert , " will tell when it comes to the charge in this case that reputation for good character alone is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt , , in a criminal case , and I say to you that that armor of protection of good character that these men have created in the forty years they have fought side by side and in other pursuits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as that no juror could reach a verdict , under that law , in fairness to the defendants , that under any evidence that might be presented here they would not be entitled to the benefit of that reasonable doubt and entitled at your hands to a speedy , prompt annihilation of the finger of suspicion that has been cast toward nthem , and through your lips , Mr. Foreman , a direction to the community and to this world that the defendants in this case , on the evidence presented . are not guilty . " Character Witnesses Heard . The first witness called by the defense was Karl Leonhardt of Los Angeles , President of the Southwestern Portland Cement Company . He took the witness chair as a character witness for Mr. Doheny . He is 72 years old and came to the ( Jolted States from Germany about forty-five years ago . He said he had known Mr. Doheny intimately for about thirty years . He swore that Mr. Doheny 's reputation for " honesty , integrity and patriotism " was in every respect " very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonhardt , and Vice President of the company of which his father-inlaw is head , testified that Mr. Doheny 's reputation for honor and integrity " was of the very highest . " When Mr. Powell was excused George W. Holland , who was Senator Walsh 's assistant in the oil investigations , was recalled to identify numerous documents which the defense expects to Introduce in evidence in the next two weeks . They were from the files of the Interior Department  --  and the defense will argue that they buttress its contention that Mr. Fall was not the dominating figure in the transaction , as the Government insists was the case , Counsel , for defense also will use some of the papers to prove their allegation that ntie leases were necessary because of outside drainage conditions , and that the leases represented a bargain for the Navy Department . BAIN GIVES TESTIMONY . When Mr. Holland was excused the defense called the first of its main reliances in this instance , H. Foster Bain , former head of the Bureau of Mines , now in business as a mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminated his duties with the Bureau of Mines June 30 , 1925 . " In what connection , if any function , " Mr. Hogan asked , " had the Bureau of Mines with regard to petroleum deposits and petroleum lands ? " " At the time it acted as the agent of the Secretary of the Interior in enforcement of provisions of the leasing act of February , 1920 , and various other acts , " said Dr. Bain . " Arthur W. Ambrose was the head of the division having this in charge . " Dr. Bain said he had never at any time had any connection with the PanAmerican Petroleum and Transport Company , nor any other connection with any interest in which Mr. Doheny or his son was interested . " When , if at all , did there come to you any duties involving the naval oil reserve in California ? " asked Mr. Hogan . " Some time in the early part of 1921 certain papers went over my desk regarding the drainage of oil in the naval reserves , " Dr. Bain replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the conference in the Secretary 's office in October , 1921 . " The subject , added Dr. Bain , was the question of what could best be done to end it . Those who took part ? in the conference , he said , were Mr. Fall , Assistant Secretary Finney , Admiral Robison , Mr. Ambrose , and peerhaps others whose names he did not recall . The result of the conference was that the participants came to the conclusion that California 's reserve No. 2 ( Buena Vista ) had ceased to exist while in the case of Elk Hills , the decision Was that certain specific parts should be leased for offset protection purposes . Questioned on Crude Oil Plan . " Did ' You receive any orders as to what was to be done with the crude oil accruing to the Government ? " Mr. Hogan inquired . " I neglected , " Dr. Bain answered , " to say that was also a subject of discussion of this conference and we discussed the possibility of exchanging crude for fuel oil , and exchanging it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing out of the reserves as It stood and he wanted to find a way to get something for the navy . " Q. ? Do you remember when Secretary Fall left for the West ? A. ? About the first part of December . Q. ? Prior to the time - that the Secretary left for the West did there come to your attention a letter dated Nov. 21 , 1921 , from Mr. E. L. Doheny to the Secretary Ales , sir . Q. ? Where did you get that letter ? A. ? Secretary Fall gave it to me. ( 2 . ? What , if any , statement or instructions did he make to or give to you at the time he turned that letter over to you ? A. ? Either at that hue or preceditng that time Secretary Fall bad told me that he asked Mr. Doheny , or Mr. Doheny had volunteered , to have Ills engineers find out for him what a million and a half barrels of tankage would cost , that being the figure which had been mentioned In our October conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. -- By whom had that figure been mentioned In your October conference an the first storage the navy would want ? A. ? Admiral Robison. 0 . ? Go ahead . A. ? When he handed rne the paper lie said : " These are the figures front Dolteny , - and he told me to ? let me see ? he had given me instructions previous to this to try to work out a plan under , which this exchange could be made ; and he gave me these figures as a part of the data to use in working ou that plan . Q. ? What did he say at that time when lie handed you this letter ? A. ? To take it up with the Admiral . Q. ? At the time that Secretary Fall left for New Mexico on Dec. 1 did you have any instructions front Admiral Robison about the Pearl Harbor matter , except such as were involved in the talk in October ? A. ? We had had a number of talks back and forward . but we had no written instructions at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " policy letter- of Oct . U , 1921 . Q. ? And the talks which you had whit Admiral Robison ? A. ? Yes . but no definite instructions to go ahead with a particular project . Q. ? When did any instructions from the navy , or any word from the navy , conic tit you on that subject ? A. ? Early in December . Identifies Roosevelt Letter . Dr. Bain identified a letter which Theodore Roosevelt , as Acting Secretary of the Navy , wrote Secretary Fall under date of Dec. 9 , 1921 . The letter , which was read . was the one in which Colonel Roosevelt told the plan to store 1,500,000 barrels of fuel oil at Pearl Harbor , which letter Colonel Roosevelt asked to be considered " in as confidential a manner as possible , " owing to the national defense feature involved . Another letter on the sam ? subject , written to the Secretary of the Navy by Assistant Secretary Finney of the Interior Department , was also put before the jury . In this letter Mr. Finney said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition to exchange crude for fuel oil was legal . Another letter , dated Dec. 14 , 1921 , was from ex-Secretary Denby to Mr. Fall . Mr. Denby said in the letter that it was his desire that the Interior Department should proceed to handle the oil and make exchange for fuel oil and storage according to plans set forth in letters of Oct. 25 , 1921 , and Dec. 9 , 1921 . At the period covered by this correspondence Mr. Fall , Dr. Bain said , was not in Washington . The conferences he had in regard to the Pearl Harbor matter , he added , were with Admiral Robison and with Mr. Finney . A score or more of other departmental communications were placed in the record in the move to prove that Mr. Fall had very little to do with the Pearl Harbor transaction . Dr. Bain said he was the official who had communicated with Gano Dunn of the J. G. White Engineering Company , and had submitted to him the Pearl Harbor plans and specifications , at the same time explaining to Mr. Dunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy and must be kept as confidential as was possible to do . Revealed Plans to Fall . Continuing , Dr. Bain testified that he had also called the attenion of Mr. Cotter of the Pan American Petroleum iind Transport Company to the Pearl Harbor project , and Mr. Cotter told him , he said , that the Doheny company would probably make a bid . Admiral Robison informed him subsequently , he said , that Mr. Doheny would bid . In the interval between Mr. Fall 's departure for New Mexico on Dec. 1 , 1921 , and his own departure for the West , a month later , Dr. Bain did not recall having seen Mr. Doheny . On his way West Dr. Bain said he stopped off at Three Rivers and showed the plans to Mr. Fall . " He had never seen them , " continued Dr. gain , " and I pointed out they were - much more complex than the plans we had in other field matters up to the time he left Washington . I outlined to him the work I had in mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in - the West . Q. ? Did you show him the specifications in the form you had them at that time ? A. ? Not in any sense of his taking them and reading them over with any care at all . There were a few sheets of typewritten pap c.er D. id you take any part in drafting the papers at that time or prat take what you got from the navy ? A. ? Absolutely what 1 got from the navy . Q. ? Did Secretary Fall make any changes in the specifications ? A. ? None whatever . Q. ? Or tell you what to have put in the specifications ? A. ? No , sir ; I do not think he even read them . Q. ? What did Secretary Pall say to you when you told hint what you were going to A. ? He and where you were going ? A. ? e said , Tong did you stay there with him ? A. ? Twenty-four hours . J. ? Where did you go then ? A. ? To Los en did you arrive there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . N 1 or 2 o'clock on the second of July . Q. ? On the subject of the mission that you were out to the West on . did you see , in Los Angeles , any of the officials of the PanAmerican Company ? A. ? T had previously asked Mr. Cotter to arrange for me to meet Mr. Anderson , Vice President , as Mr. Anderson was , as I understood from Mr. Cotter. the one to handle this , and Mr. Cotter and Mr. Anderson came to the train to meet me . Met Doherty the Next Day . Dr. Bain was then asked if he met any other officials of that company in a conference when the plans were talked of and in reply he said that the next morning he met Mr. Doheny Sr. at the offices of the Pan-American Company . " And Mr. Danzinger , and Mr. Bridges ? I think Mr. Norman Bridges  --  and my recollection is now that is the time I met Mr. ? Doheny Jr . ; there may have been others  --  and Mr. Cotter was present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , did you place before those gentlemen , and what did you say to them ? " asked Mr. Hogan . " I placed before them the plans and specifications , one set from this roll that I was carrying , " said Dr. Bain . " I explained to them the confidential character of the project ; the difficulties that I had met in attempting to frame a proposal that would cover it ; the ideas which I then had as to the various ways the proposals might be ' drafted ; and I told them the other companies that I was going to take this up with , and asked them to consider the matter and be prepared to give me an answer as to whether they would or would not put in a bid on this project . " After conferring with the Doheny people in Los Angeles Dr. Bain said he proceeded't6 San Francisco , where he placed the Pearl Harbor proposition before the Standard Oil Company of California , the General Petroleum Corporation , the Pacific Oil Company and the Associated Oil Company . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon at the California Club , : where he saw the officers of the General Petroleum Corporation and several others . There he learned that this company thought the contract for the Pearl Harbor project would be without law and would not bid . In Los Angeles he saw PanAmerican Company officials at their office for a few moments . Dr. Bain testified that there he was told the company had decided that they would be prepared to make a bid when the proposals were submitted . Officials of the Union Oil Company also were seen . The witness said he came away with the impression that they would be interested only in royalty oil but that according to later developments he had obtained the wrong impression . Bain Prepared the Proposals . Secretary Fall told Assistant Secretary Finney of the Interior Department late in January or early February , Dr. Bain continued , to go ahead and handle the matter , as he ( Fall ) was going to be busy with other things . Dr. Bain stated that he himself decided upon and prepared the method that was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , of Judge Finney and Admiral Robison . He was told by Judge Finney , Dr. Bain added , " that while the law did not require the advertising of bids , or even the taking of bids , it was desirable to take bids , but not necessary. , to advertise them . " He explained why specifications for the Pearl Harbor contract were not given to the Chicago Bridge and Iron Works . A criticism from that cornnany of this refusal was read to the Court yesterday by Mr. Roberts ' for the Government . Dr. Bain said he notified Senators and McCormick in April , 1922 , before the bids were opened , that the specifications were given only to those people who were able to receive crude , oil in return for their work of constructing the Pearl Harbor storage tanks . These Senators were informed also that the company was on the list of subcontractors who had done satisfactory work for the Navy Department that was furnished the contractors . If the Chicago concern had been able to take oil for their work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the specifications . but to have given it to them under the circumstances , he maintained , would have been unfair . He testified also that Pearl Harbor , prior to December , 1921 , had been considered only as one of the places of possible storage . The Pittsburgh and Des Moines Steel Company received the same information as was given the Chicago Bridge and Iron Works , Dr. Bain said . The Foundation Company received a copy of the plans and - specifications when it stated that the Standard Oil Company had agreed to take the crude oil off its hands . Tells of Opening of Bids . The witness went on to say that the bids were opened April 15 , 1922 , by Assistant Secretary Finney in the presence of J. J. Cotter , a representative of the Pan-American Company ; Mr. Dunn , a representative of the J. G. White Engineering Company , and Dr. Bain . After they were opened they were turned over for study to Dr. Bain and Mr. Ambrose , the latter being the chief , petroleum technologist . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose bids should be accepted . Dr. Bain also explained that Judge Fin bey had said Secretary Fall was satisfied with the legality of the proposed contract and had seen no reason for getting an opinion from the Attorney General . The witness stated also that Secretary Fall had told him ? not to el , anything except by order of the Secretary of the Navy . ? On cross-examinatibn by Mr. Roberts Dr. Bain was grilled for the details of what occurred respecting the oil leases in the Autumn and Winter of 1921 . It was on Nov. 30 of that year that Mr. Doheny said he loaned $100,000 to Mr. Fall . The witness admitted that Secretary Fall had told him in November he expected a communication from Mr. Doheny . He declared that since Oct. 15 of that year Secretary Fall , Admiral Robison and himself had been working on a contract ,
