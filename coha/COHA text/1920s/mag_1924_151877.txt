Grand Duke Cyril , uncrowned Tsar of Russia , cousin of the late Nicholas , received a nasty jolt when he heard that an Anglo-Russian treaty had been signed ( TIME , Aug. 18 , COMMONWEALTH ) . He was in his house at Coburg , Germany , when reporters pounced upon him and asked him what about it ? " The Grand Duke , of Romanov proportions , towering above the minions of the press , said : <P> " During the last few days , like all Russians faithful to the Fatherland , I have learned with great amazement that the government of Great Britain has signed an agreement with the tyrannical oligarchy which seized power in Russia . In this agreement , among other things , a large loan is promised the Soviet government . <P> " As legal heir to the Emperors of all Russia , I consider it my duty to declare clearly and firmly , so that all may hear , the following : <P> " If I had so much as a ray of hope that the impending loan would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her starving people , I should welcome this help with delight , without consideration through the hands of what Russian government it passed . <P> " But for me and for all Russians there can be no doubt whatever that the loan is being concluded , not with the object of helping and benefiting the Russian people , but only to strengthen and prolong the term of government of enslavers of the Nation and give the Third Internationale the possibility to continue its destructive propaganda in Europe , Asia , Africa and America . The object of this propaganda is world upheaval-that is to say , the ruin of Christian civilization and the plunging of the entire earth into the dark abyss of barbarism , pauperism and serfdom to the advantage and satisfaction of only a small group of fanatics and a dissolute group of men who have lost honor and conscience , and hope to exploit this upheaval for the gratification of their cupidity and vicious appetites .
