Members of the British Royal Academy were vexed last week with a painful problem . One of their most distinguished members , Charles Sims , had sent six pictures for hanging . His eagerness to have the pictures shown was well known , but the members of the Academy were less willing to put them on display . Charles Sims had committed suicide the previous week by jumping in a river with stones in his pockets ; his six paintings were obviously the work of a madman . <P> One of the paintings was called Here Am I. Another was Man 's Last Pretense of Consummation to Indifference . A third was titled Behold , I Have Graven Thee on the Palm of My Hand . Remembering much solid and conservative work which had previously been signed by Charles Sims , remembering , too , the portrait of George V which Painter Sims had executed at their request and which they had been forced to decline because it gave the monarch spindle legs , several of the Hanging Committee thought it would be kinder not to show these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice to his agent , before killing himself , to ask that his paintings be sent to the Academy on the right day , accompanied by the titles he had given them .
