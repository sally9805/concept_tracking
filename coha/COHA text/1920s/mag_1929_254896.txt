As a seasonal present to its readers , that elegant monthly The Sportsman issued an elegant supplement , " Fox Hunting Formalities , " by J. Stanley Reeve , seasoned and punctilious sportsman of Haverford , Pa . Member of the Radnor and Whitemarsh Valley Hunt Clubs , second-cousin-in-law of the late Theodore Roosevelt and of the late Poetess Amy Lowell , J. Stanley Reeve has been called ( last year by Town &; Country ) " The leading fox hunter of the leading fox hunting city in the country . " Except for a few weeks many years ago when he substituted at Radnor he has never been a master of foxhounds . But he knows what M. F. H. 's like and how ordinary foxcatchers should comport themselves . Points and excerpts from his primer : <P> " Have your hunters shod by a competent blacksmith every three weeks-four weeks at the outside-and then you will practically never have to pull out of a hunt because you 've lost a shoe . " <P> " Do not wear ratcatcher* to an opening meet or scarlet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a big flask on one side and a sandwich box on the other . Carry one or the other , but not both . . . . Do not strew the paper from your sandwich box all about the countryside . " <P> Arrive ten minutes before the hounds are scheduled to start . If the fixture is near you , hack to it so as to find your seat . But do not take a short-cut through likely coverts . <P> " When the Master . . . walks past you , lift your hat to him as you do to a lady or when passing a coach and four . . . . Do n't ask him where he expects to draw . . . . Where he intends hounds to draw is his and his huntsman 's affair , and not yours . " <P> Let the M. F. H. ride to covertside alone . " Keep at least a hundred feet behind him ; then if a hound is emptying itself , you wo n't be so likely to override it . " <P> " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Try to keep on the inside of the circle when the hounds turn toward you . It makes your horse last longer because he has less distance to go . If you override the hounds , do not tell the Master you could not hold your horse . " Simply say , ' Sorry . ' . . . Remember for the rest of your hunting life that a horse you can not hold is the poorest of excuses for overriding hounds . If one can not control one 's horse , the hunting field is no place for one . " <P> When you sight the fox say , " Yonder he goes . " Say it quietly and " make sure first that it is a fox and not a cat or a cur dog . Do n't say ' There it goes . ' Do not get excited . Remember that foxes have been viewed and hallooed away for centuries . It is nothing new . " <P> When the fox goes to ground , " do not ride up to the earth and try to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole . If you insist on making yourself useful , ask the huntsman if you may hold his horse for him . " <P> " As you pass the huntsman , say ' Thank you , good night ' to him . " <P>
