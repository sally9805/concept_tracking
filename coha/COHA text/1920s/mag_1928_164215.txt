How to decline a challenge to duel and yet retain one 's honor unimpaired is a problem which periodically presents itself to the Prime Minister of France . <P> Last week , in the Chamber of Deputies itself , Raymond Poincare was holding forth from the Tribune upon the wisdom of extending a loan to Rumania , biggest of the little allies of France . <P> Interrupted and sneered Deputy Bergery , a onetime undersecretary to M. <P> <P> Poincare , " I am most skeptical that such a loan will ever be repaid . " <P> " So , it is M. Bergery , " said the Prime Minister softly , with a slow , maddening smile , " I recognize the M. Bergery whom I knew on the Reparations Commission-always ready to distort the truth . " <P> " Withdraw ! " screamed Bergery , " Withdraw ! If you do n't take back the words ' distort the truth ' I will send you my seconds . " <P> For an instant the brow of the Prime Minister was stern , beetled , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled , " No , no , M. Bergery . You asked me to be your second-your best man-at your first marriage . I refused you then . I still refuse . " <P> Amid mirthful uproar MM . Les Deputes recalled that the first wife of M. Bergery , an actress , soon divorced him . Later deflated Challenger Bergery excused himself thus : " I spoke in the heat of debate . Of course I had no intention of sending seconds to the Prime Minister . "
