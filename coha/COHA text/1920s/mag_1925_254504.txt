Some of the major discoveries of diggers - archaeologists and paleontologists - recently made or described , include : <P> In Nevada , along the Muddy River , extending for some six miles from St. Thomas to near Overton , was discovered the remains of a great Pueblo or rather pre-Pueblo , village . Governor Scrugham of that state , interested in archaeology , came across several historical references to a buried city . He organized an expedition under the scientific direction of Mr. M. R. Harrington of the Museum of the American Indian , Heye Foundation ( Manhattan ) . Last fall , the site of the buried city was found . Excavations undertaken by Mr. Harrington and Dr. Kidder of the Smithsonian Institution , and financed by the Heye Foundation , have indicated that it is a record of the oldest civilization in this country . <P> About 20 chambers have been excavated . The upper structure had crumbled , but beneath the houses were what appear to have been ceremonial chambers , with great stone benches against the walls . Many layers of ashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these chambers were graves . With the skeletons were found pottery vessels ( for water ) and baskets ( for food ) on the journey to the hereafter . The stature of adults was not much over five feet . Grains of corn , corncobs , squash seeds and beans indicated that the people had practiced dry farming at a time when the region was not as arid as it now is . There were also bones of deer , mountain sheep and rabbits , remains of fibre garments and garments of twisted leather , the inevitable dice , beads of turquoise and shell . The pottery , white or light-colored with black designs , was made without potters ' wheels . There were chipped stone implements . The living chambers of the houses uncovered were small - only about six by eight feet , a contrast to the large communal houses of the later tribes . <P> The erosion of the houses has been considerable and this , in a very dry region , points to great age . The village is farther to the north and west than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at from 5,000 to 10,000 years - which makes it as old or older than the most ancient Egyptian tombs . Governor Scrugham has accepted the title of " Pueblo Grande de Nevada " for the buried city , and plans to convert it into a state park . Needless to say , the work of excavation has only begun . <P> It is rare , in America , for a man to carry academic interests into politics , yet Governor Scrugham , a professor by occupation , has served science in politics . <P> In Babylonia , at Ur of the Chaldees , the expedition of the British Museum and of the University of Pennsylvania began to delve into the ruins surrounding the great ziggurat or tower . The first works uncovered date from about 600 B. C. ; in the courtyard of a temple of the Moon God was found a building believed to have been used as a sort of convent schoolroom and museum by the priestesses . Another building , a temple to Nin-Gal , wife of the Moon God , has also been uncovered in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated from 2,500 B.C. ; going down to the lower foundations , the excavators found older and older masonry , some of primitive unbaked bricks that may have been laid as early as 2,800 B. C.
