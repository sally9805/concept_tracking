As everyone knows , the beauty of the Langhorne sisters long was the pride of Virginia , the joy of the nation 's portrait painters . Their fame spread far and wide , to England where Nancy Langhorne , as Viscountess Astor , brought beauty and sharp wits to Parliament ; to Manhattan , where Irene Langhorne became the wife of Charles Dana Gibson , noted artist in pen and ink , who hung her picture from a myriad mouldings , the original " Gibson girl . " <P> Not to be outdone by her politically active sister , Manhattan 's Langhorne came last week to Houston . No scion of a Virginian First Family , no Maryland Ritchie or Bruce , held her allegiance ; she marched in the parade of the Brown Derby . <P> Nor was she the only brown turbanite in the parade . Lightly as the Bosses appraise the worth of women in politics , they saw to it that Houston need yield nothing to Kansas City in the number , the beauty , the distinction of its lady delegates . Mabel Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis Knight , daughter of mere Vice-Presidential Curtis , with Emily Smith Warner , favorite daughter of the Brown Derby himself . Delegate Warner was not unbefriended . Her mother , husband , * sister , three brothers , many in-laws , were among the watched and watching observers . But she missed her father , sent him cheering messages . <P> Her mother , the ample , friendly woman who had been Kitty Dunn , would be perhaps the most conspicuous , not the most distinguished of Houston 's unofficial guests . Edith Boiling Gait Wilson , widow of Democracy 's last President , held the Wilsonian mantle over the shoulders of the Brown Derby , deciding the dynastic succession . Observer Smith and Observer <P> Wilson had met before , had laughed together over a tale of a luncheon with President Coolidge in the Adirondacks . <P> Houston had beauty , Houston had distinction . It would not lack the authority of age and experience . From New York came Elizabeth Marbury , 72 years old by grace of exactly a week , vigorous social worker and business woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over California 's Gertrude Franklin Atherton , who will not be 71 until next Hallowe'en . Delegates wondered at the youthful appearance of Mrs. Atherton , ascribed it variously to the California climate , to her busy literary life , to her intense interest in the problems of rejuvenation . <P> Not easily missed would be Mrs. Jefferson Borden Harriman , seasoned veteran of conventions . Delegate Harriman bustled , conferred , entertained , all in the interests of the Brown Derby but with one eye on the features of Montana 's rugged Walsh , onetime candidate . Did he frown , remembering earlier bustling , conferring , entertaining in his behalf ? Did he smile , recalling that he had released his followers from political loyalty , if not from personal affection ? Delegate Harriman speculated . In a dining-room high above Times Square , Manhattan , another friend lunched privately and importantly with his fellow princes of the press . Diminutive Louis Wiley , presiding over the business destinies of his paper , would see that the gowns , the epigrams of Delegate Harriman were not denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> * Major J. A. Warner , Supt. of the New York State Police .
