Like a luscious , dangling fruit is Manchuria , granary of the Orient , the only part of China not impoverished by war and famine , a prosperous land that absorbs annually $36,000,000 worth of U. S. goods . Last week the growling and hissing of Russian Bear and Chinese Dragon over the Manchurian prize grew increasingly furious until the two Great Powers clawed warily at each other , drew a few spurts of soldier blood . Such was the smoke screen of lies set up by both antagonists that alert observers could set down only a few vital , verifiable developments : <P> Dragon Pussyfoots . Shrewdest move of the week was made by President Chiang Kai-shek of China and Foreign Minister C. T. Wang when they sought to use the general treaty for the renunciation of war ( Kellogg Pact ) ( see p. 9 ) as a shield to cover up the high-handed fashion in which , last fortnight , they booted out of China the entire Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway ( see map ) . The expulsion was clearly not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though it was a deadly blow at the Far Eastern commerce of Russia ) . Consequently , argued the Chinese Foreign Office , last week , China did not violate the Kellogg Pact in ousting the Russians , but if Moscow should take military steps to avenge their expulsion then the Soviet Government would be guilty of a violation , would deserve to be disciplined by other Powers who have signed the Pact . <P> Nowhere was this ingenious argument received with such indignation as at Tokyo . Japan has , as Russia had , a great number of her Nationals employed on a Manchurian line-the Southern Manchurian Railway . If the Kellogg Pact can be successfully invoked when China is kicking out Russians , it would be quite as useful should China one day decide to boot out Japanese . <P> Easily secured by Mr. Stimson was the cooperation of both Britain and France , the latter country consenting to transmit his " reminder " to Russia ( see p. 9 ) . Soon after the " reminder " was transmitted , Statesman Stimson received formal assurance from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that each would abide by the Kellogg Treaty , that neither intended to take hostile action in their dispute . <P> First Blow ? But , since the Kellogg Pact loses its legalistic potency to prevent war as soon as shots have actually been fired by one of the adversaries , major interest centred last week on numerous border skirmishes , incessantly rumored to be taking place along the Chino-Russian frontier . The moment such a skirmish assumed sufficiently bloody proportions to be called an " overt act , " it might serve as the tinder spark of war . Soon across the barrier of censorship , lies vast and uncharted distances , came a loud Chinese accusation . The Governor-Dictator of Manchuria , Marshal Chang Hsueh-Liang , officially charged that Red troops had attacked Chinese frontier guards not far from Pogro-nichnaya ( see map ) .
