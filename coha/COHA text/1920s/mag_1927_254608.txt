Representative James A. Gallivan of Massachusetts is Irish , Democratic and Wet . In his youth he was a hard-hitting baseball player for Harvard . But more important than that , he is the most popular funnyman in the House . Well do Congressmen remember when he strolled up the aisle to deliver his annual " message " ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) . <P> Being a man of impulses , * he recently began to look into certain publications of the Department of Agriculture . He found that a recipe prescribing whiskey , milk and eggs for cows ' and horses ' ailments , which was advised by the Department of Agriculture for 33 years , has been omitted since 1923 . <P> " This attempt to censor the morals of our cows and horses , " announced Mr. Gallivan last week , " is surely the ultimate in Prohibition enforcement . " <P> Whimsically , he suggested an investigation by Congress . Whereupon , Secretary of Agriculture Jardine , hitherto unknown as a humorist , replied : " So far as I know the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordeal , some of them even kicking up their heels and showing a great deal of spirit . As for the goats-I still have mine . " <P> <P> *A friend once asked him : " Jim , is this right since that primary you have been on the wagaon since primary day ? " <P> " Absolutely , " replied Mr. Gallivan , " but you know I am a , man of impulses. "
