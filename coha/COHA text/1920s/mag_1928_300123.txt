There are nearly 500 newspapers in the U. S. printed in foreign languages . Chicago has 60 of them ; New York City , 61. * <P> Last week , the oldest Italian daily newspaper in New York , Il Progresso Italo-Americano ( founded 1880 ) , was sold to Generose Pope , president of the Colonial Sand and Stone Co. , for $2,053,000-about twice the sum which Paul Block recently paid for the Brooklyn Standard Union . <P> This means that Il Progresso , with a circulation of 81,000 , undoubtedly shows a profit of $200,000 a year ; that foreign language newspapers are phenomenally valuable properties . <P> Il Progresso is but one of five Italian newspapers in New York City . Its most potent rival is Corriere d'America ( circulation 53,401 ; 76,000 Sunday ) , which has been called the finest tabloid-sized newspaper in the U. S. <P> <P> *There are only seven Chicago newspapers printed in English ; 22 in New York City .                    @
