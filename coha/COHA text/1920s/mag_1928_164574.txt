Star gazers in Germany have sat comfortably back in their planetaria ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) and watched the earth move round the sun , the solar system gyrate . A lecturer has stood beside a colossal intricate mechanism , a steel cylindrical apparatus about 25 feet long with a great steel sphere at each end , bulbous with electric eyes . These were the stars and planets ; each with its own motor to send it through any . desired orbit . Upon the huge domed ceiling , 75 feet across , the professor could project the sky as it looked to three shepherds of Judea on a certain cold night in December , or as it will look to the man in the street on any night in the year 5000 . <P> Benito Mussolini , irked that the children of Germany should see the stars more clearly than the children of Fascismo , commanded that a great planetarium should be built by the firm of Carl Zeiss of Jena , Germany , and delivered over to Rome . <P> Last week Max Adler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. too must have its planetarium , gave $500,000 for its construction on the lake front island east of the Field Museum . Apparatus and instruments will be of the finest , having been ordered from Carl Zeiss , who promised delivery in the fall ot 1929 . The 1933 world 's fair will see the planetarium performing in its noble 200 foot hall ; projecting more than 4,500 planets , planetoids , and stars in orbital motion upon a domed sky 100 feet in diameter . <P> Said Philanthropist Adler : " In giving the planetarium to Chicago , I have a threefold conception . . . . The third is to emphasize that all mankind , rich and poor , powerful and weak , as well as all nations , here and abroad , constitute part of one universe , and that under the great celestial firmament there is no division or cleavage , but rather interdependence and unity .
