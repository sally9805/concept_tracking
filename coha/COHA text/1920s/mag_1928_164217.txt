Channel swimmers take off from Cap Gris Nez , France . Last week the Breton fishing trawler Sainte Therese de L'Enfant Jesus was wallowing past Cape Gray Nose when Captain Jean Marie Bougrad espied a body that did not swim . <P> Boathooks jabbed at a semi-skeleton from which half the flesh had sloughed away . Seeing a glint of gold at the wrist , Captain Bougrad warned his men not to let it slip off . When peered at it proved to be an identification bracelet engraved : Captain Loewenstein , 315 Rue de la Science , Brussels . <P> " We fisherfolk do n't read the papers , " said sturdy Breton Bougrad some days later , " All we knew was that it must be a Belgian . . . . We wrapped it in a tarpaulin , lashed it across our stern , and put straight in to Boulogne . " <P> Persons who read papers knew that the $55,000,000 estate of Belgium 's richest jew could now be distributed to his heirs , since his death was certain at last . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Brussels had refused to issue a death certificate , holding that Captain Loewenstein was simply " missing , " after his disappearance from an airplane in flight over the English Channel ( TIME , July 16 ) . This ruling , if persisted in , would have made it impossible to distribute the estate until 100 years after Captain Loewenstein 's birth , or in 1977 . <P> Identification was made absolute , last week , when certain unfinished dental work in the skeleton 's upper jaw was positively identified by Captain Loewenstein 's dentist . Mme. Loewenstein sent a - brother and brother-in-law to view the appalling sight . Not present was son &; heir Robert Loewenstein , 18 , racially only half a Jew and , like his father , a Roman Catholic by conviction . <P> Said Brother-in-law Convert , husband of Captain Loewenstein 's late sister : " I want this affair cleared up . If my brother-in-law was drugged we must know about it , if possible . Suicide is out of the question . On the day before his death Captain Loewenstein telephoned one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his son ride in the horse show at Geneva . He was a man too happy to commit suicide . " Autopsy findings . " . . . many multiple fracture wounds , proving that the fall was from a great height ... no trace of drugs or poisons . . . muscular derangement . . . evidence that he was alive when he struck the water .
