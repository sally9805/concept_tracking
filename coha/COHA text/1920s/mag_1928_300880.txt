THE TALE OF GENJI , PART IV-BLUE TROUSERS-Lady Murasaki , translated by Arthur Waley-Houghton Mifflin ( $3.50 ) . <P> The Story . Through three volumes of well-bred indiscretions Prince Genji proved himself master of the delectable art of making love . In the fourth , with old age creeping on , he proves himself master of the art of being betrayed . Kashiwagi , Prince Genji 's friend , cuckolds him with his girl-bride , Nyosan . In the fury of discovery Genji plans glorious revenge . But his usual dignity , mellowed by age , prevents him from hasty action , and allows of reconsideration . For it has occurred to him that in his youth he had seduced a concubine of the old Emperor , his own father , and though the old man must have known perfectly well what was going on , he had pretended not to see . Taking counsel from this time-honored precedent , Genji blandly ignored the conscience-smitten Kashiwagi , and soon actually pitied his terror-stricken young Nyosan . <P> He was more interested anyway in the heroine of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit and mature charm . " Coming from the presence of younger women , such as Nyosan , Genji always expected that Murasaki would appear to him inevitably ( and he was willing to make allowance for it ) a little bit jaded , a trifle seared and worn . . . . But as a matter of fact it was just these younger women who failed to provide any element of surprise , whereas Murasaki was continually astounding him . . . her clothes scented with the subtlest and most delicious perfumes . . . . " <P> When at last she died Genji mourned her with elaborate ceremonies ( blue trousers were part of the mourning costume ) , and decided upon monastic retirement . If indeed he took pleasure some months later in the liveliness of one Chujo No Kimi 's features , the red and yellow of her trousers , the sombre purple of her robe , it was but the lifetime habit of chivalry in the presence of beauty . <P> The Significance .

" Don Quixote with a dash of Jane Austen " . . . fortunately the ancient Japanese document is no such mongrel monstrosity as all of this . But the reviewers ' floundering tributes indicate something of its variegated appeal . In limpid prose The Tale combines curiously modern social satire with great charm of narrative . Translator Waley has done service to literature in salvaging to the Occident this masterpiece of the Orient written circa 1002 A. D. <P> The Author . A lady at the glittering Japanese court of the 11th Century , Murasaki Shikibu was a shrewd observer of life in the capital . Up to her time fiction had taken the form of short fairy tales and allegories ; her 4,000-page novel was a distinct innovation , the first attempt at realism . Some say she was called Murasaki after the heroine of her famous tale ; others ( among them Amy Lowell ) say that the Mikado whose favorite she was wrote her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is in full color one can scarcely perceive the other plants in the field .
