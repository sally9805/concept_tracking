Every summer the little town of Bisley , Surrey , has its day in the news when hawk-eyed , steady-handed sharpshooters assemble from all over the world to shoot for the King 's prize . The famed ranges of the National Rifle Association are at Bisley , and Bisley is to shooting what St. Andrews is to golf. * <P> Deadshots who annually arrive at Bisley station with their gun cases , their wind gauges , their range finders , telescopes and tallow candles ( for blackening front sights ) never notice Bisley village , never notice Bisley church , and they have positively ignored Dr. John Gwyon , rector of Bisley Church for 33 years . <P> Four months ago the Reverend Gwyon , brooding upon his insignificance , made his will and hanged himself in the Old Rectory on Christmas Eve . Last week the will was probated , and immediately Bisley Church , Bisley village , and the late Dr. John Gwyon , achieved prominence entirely apart from the rifle butts . Ten thousand pounds ( $50,000 ) was left by the strangulated cleric " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " None of the money can be used for any other purpose . <P> " Each lucky boy , " so reads the will , " must have the words ' GWYON 'S PRESENT ' written in capital letters sewn in the lining of his breeches . " Sports knickers are not allowed . <P> * " I expect you 'll be starting up the Bisley matches again , now the War 's over , " said the son of an N. R. A. official shortly after the Armistice . " Yes , of course , " replied the father , ' ' but we ca n't expect many good scores . There has n't been any really serious shooting since the War began . "
