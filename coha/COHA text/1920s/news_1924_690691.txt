" Failure of the scandal on the eve of the world 's series to affect tile sale of tickets for the games in Washington tomorrow and Sunday and at the Polo Grounds on Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday . Landis Ends Rumors . These developments followed closely L ? on the heels of the first revelation of the scandal that has caused a great stir In baseball carafes throughout the nation . Rumors flew thick and fast yesterday . There was talk that the Giants had been disqualified and that they would be replaced in the series against Washington by the - Brooklyn Robins , who- finished second in . the National League race . During the day there were persistent reports that the ' series had been . called off and . it was not until late last evening that this was definitely disposed of by a statement from Commissioner Landis . Interest in the world 's series did not seem to decrease as a result of the sudden news that O'Connell , the $73.000 beauty from the Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the series by asking a player on another team to throw a game . One result of the scandal was that the Senators were made slight favorites over the Giants in the series , though there were late , indications that this might shift back and make the teams even money in the betting , on the belief that the Giants would now fight all the harder to show their mettle . The sentiment of the public was one condemning the player and coach for their actions . Among the Giant players there was an attitude of pity for O'Connell and a continued silence regarding Dolan . The Giant players departed for Wash- , ington at 3:30 yesterday afternoon in a sober frame of mind but not downcast . Each and every one seemed grimly determined to do his best and play his hardest in an effort to beat Washington . The high baseball officials had left town yesterday with the exception of Manager and President Stone= ' ham of the Giants . , who had intended to lead his team into the national Capitol , was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the games at the Polo Grounds , business that he had been forced to sidetrack for two days because of the baseball scandal . Manager will leave this afternoon for Washington and will remain with the team throughout the series , he stated last night . ? characterized as asinine the attempt of O'Connell to bribe Sand . " It was so foolish that I - cannot find words to describe it , " said . The Little Napoleon , whose great baseball ambition to win four straight Pennants had been realized only to have the achievement clouded by the unlooked for and unhappy incident , was calm and determined that his team would come out of the series victorious and cleared of any scandal . O'Connell Repeats Accusations . O'Connell 's charges involving all of the Giant players were contained in his detailed story of the attempt he made to bribe Sand Saturday at the Polo Grounds and the refusal by the Philadelphia player to consider the offer . " They 5were all in on it and they deserted ' me when they found I was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked me if I knew Heinie Sand very well and I told dim that I did , as we played together in the Coast League . Dolan said to me : ' If you can get Sand not to bear down on us in the game today it will be worth 5500 to him . ' " I asked Dolan where the , TI500 was to come from and Dolan said , ' All of the players are subscribing to it . ' So 1 toll Dolan that I would go and see Sand and I did . met him out near the third base coaching line and I said to him : ' Heinle. if you will not bear down on us today It will be worth 5500 to you . ' Sand said , ' You go to hell ? ' Then he walked away . I went back to our bench and Dolan said to me , ' What did Sand say ? ' I replied : ' He said there was nothing doing . ' Dolan then told me , ' Well , Jimmy , forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross Young came to me and said , ' Did Dolan say anything to you ? ' I said , ' Yes , he did . ' ' Well , you go ahead with it , ' said Young . Then Frisch came to me and said to i tell Sand that if he would throw the game to the Giants lie could have anything he wanted and Kelly also told me to go ahead and speak to Sand . " After I told Dolan what Sand said , I forgot all about the thing and played in the game that day when we clinched the pennant . The next thing I knew Commissioner Landis culled me to his room and questioned me . I told him what had happened and then he called in the other fellows . That was on Tuesday and the next day I received word from Judge Landis that I had been placed on the ineligible list . I do n't know what I am going to do now and I guess I am in a fix . " Dolan paid a visit to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair . He denied em ! , phatically that he had a thing to do with the the attempted bribery of Sand and declared that when he was called before Commissioner Landis It was the first inkling he had had of the affair . Will See Lan . ' s Again . ' Judge Landis asked me if I recalled a conversation with O'Connell on Saturday , in which I had instructed him to try to bribe Sand , " said Dolan . " I replied that I did not remember .. And I told the truth . for I did not have any such conversation with O'Connell , and it was all news to me and I am innocent of any connection with the affair at all . I am in a 3am , but I will go to see ' Commissioner Landis when the series is over and I hope to be able to prove that I am innocent . " 's first knowledge that O'Connell had tried to bribe Sand came to him Tuesday evening , the GiantIleader said , when he and President Stoneham of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel . " On Tuesday at noon , " said , " Air . " Stonenam and I called on Commissioner Landis to talk over the details of the world 's series and the chartering of a special train from Washington ' following the game on Sunday with the Senators . As we were leaving Landis asked me where he could get in touch with O'Connell . This did not strike me as an odd request because of the fact that some days ago O'Connell had asked to be excused from the European trip with the Giants and White Sox because he had been offered a chance , to play on the Coast during the time the trip was planned . I had told him that if he could get permission from Commissioner Landis it would be all right with me . " It was on my mind when Commissioner Landis asked for his address that he intended to h. ve a talk with O'Connell regarding this matter . Later Commissioner Landis called me on the phone at my office and asked for the addresses and phone numbers of Players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and supposed that this request had to do with a previous demand these three players had made that they be paid their regular salaries during the world 's series . " These three had said that the players threatened to strike unless this condition was met and they said that a conference with the Washington players on this subject was contemplated . I advised them that the National and American Leagues at a joint meeting last Winter had passed a rule against paying players their salaries during the series . I also told them that any such demand would have to be taken up with Commissioner Landis , and when the Commissioner asked to get in touch with them I ; naturally supposed that was what was on his mind . All Are Summoned by Landis . " That evening . Tuesday evening , Commissioner Landis telephoned to me that he wished to see Mr. Stoneham and myself at his rooms . About 7 o'clock ' we went to his rooms and found O'Connell , Dolan , Kelly , Frisch and Young there ' Then I was informed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the facts ' that O'Connell had confessed I turned to Dolan and said : " ' Cozy , if you know anything about this thing or about any player on the club doing anything of the kind , you tell it to Commissioner Landis . ' " ' I do not know a thing , ' Dolan told me and , after Commissioner Landis had talked to him in the next room for quite a while , Landis came out and said , ' He does n't know a thing . " I spoke to Frisch. to Kelly , to Young and to Dolan and asked them to tell me honestly if they had had anything to do with the attempted bribery and they told me they knew nothing of it . " I questioned the players individually and collectively later and they all persisted that they knew nothing of the affair and that O'Connell must have acted on his own initiative . I feel that they were telling the truth . It is a hard thing ' to have come to your club , and Mr. Stoneham and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do everything in our power to investigate any angle that may arise . However , the Investigation of any new development is up to Commissioner Landis , as ho requested that the investigation be left in his hands . " President Stoneham was shocked at the disclosure . He esaid he did not care to make a lengthy statement , but that one giving the attitude of the club would be issued by . . " I was shocked : it is a terrible thing , " said Stoneham. - " Judge Landis took the **30;383;TOOLONG , - osur ; support in any - aetiantie eeereeeee President eW.fillitili ! ' : ; r0Altikeeebrelhe Philadelphia clubeeebeeora he ; left " ** quickness in reporting the attempted bribe to his manager , Arthur Fidtcher . " I have nothing to . add to the statement issued by Commissioner Landis. " said Mr. Baker . " The affair is not a black eye to baseball but rather a good thing for the game , as ? itetestifies that . the honest players will expose ills tonesty every time . I am going to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to make when I arrive . there . O'Connell a Pathetic Figure . The appearance of O'Connell at the Polo Grounds yesterday morning was a dramatic one . fter the exposure of his attempt to bribe Sand it was not expected that the player would ' face his fellow players or his manager , John . However , he was one of the first of the players to arrive at the grounds . He did not attempt to put on a uniform for the ' practice that had been ordered by , but stood around , his head bowed . After Manager arrived , O'Connell sent word to the chief of the National League champions that he would ' like to have his side of the story heard . , who had brooded over the developments that involved ' his club , was loan to see the player , but finally decided he would . O'Connell was called into 's office . - " Well , " said , " what have you to say . Jimmy ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How ' did you ever get yourself into a thing like this ? " asked . " I do n't know , " cried O'Connell then i breaking down he threw himself nto. a chair , buried his head in his hands and sobbed : " I ca n't go home , I Ca n't go home . " He was completely broken , and though questioned at some length he could get very little from O'Connell . A little later O'Connell was found sitting on the rubbing table in the Giants ' clubhouse , a dejected youngster . When the other players came in . from the field they paid little attention to O'Connell . Emil " Irieh " eleueel , ' a fellow Californian and ' O'Connell 's - roommate on most of the season 's trip with the Giants , was the only one of the players to speak to Jimmy . " I am sorry , " said Meusel , as he patted O'Connell on the back . But that was all . When the players had finished their workout , the last one they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington to face the American League champions in the opening struggle of the series at Washington tomorrow , and had entered the clubhouse , issued orders that he wished to talk to each player . To each member of the team put this question : " Do you know anything about this mess ? " All Deny Knowledge of Affair . " They all denied they knew anything , " said last night ' in his statement . " I then talked to the boys collectively . I told them that the affair greatly handicapped us and that we necessarily would enter the series under a cloud and that it . was quite likely that they would face a , good deal of criticism at the hands of the crowd in Washington . I told them that they would have to bear up under this as best they could and that all they could do was to go in and fight and win ball games and forget everything else . " Previously I had talked with Captain Frisch and , like all the players , he denied absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were telling the truth . I know they will be greatly handicapped , but 1 am sure they will fight hard and I think we will win . The morale of the club , of course , is not at its best under such conditions . We will have eilany things to contend with , but I am confident we will come through all right . " The Giant squad got off for Washington at 3:30 yesterday afternoon on the Congresstonar Limited from Penn Station . The players were unusually glum . None would make any comment on the affair . A crowd of about 1,000 waited in the station for the players , and , while there was no cheering , there was a lot of handshaking . The party of players was under the care of Hughie Jennings and Secretary Jim Tierney . All of the players , with . of course , the exception of O'Connell and Dolan . made the trip . The players , while refusing to comment on the actions of O'Connell and Dolan . were willing enough to talk of their chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' would win . They admitted that they would enter the series far from happy . The banning of O'Connell and Dolan naturally enough had affected them . but despite this they said they believed they would prove strong enough to defeat the Senators , and even expressed confidence in their ability to beat Walter Johnson should the Senators ' ace hurl the opening game , as it is expected he will .
