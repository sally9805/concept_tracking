Luxurious and very exclusive is a certain private sanitarium near Malmaison to which the great of France are discreetly taken when they grow not quite bright . <P> There the Emperor Napoleon sent the Empress Josephine to pass a quiet spell . Later her very room was occupied by M. Paul Deschanel , who grew slightly demented after he had been President of France ( TIME , Aug. 2 , 1926 ) . " When great M. ReneViviani came to the U. S. as High Commissioner with Marshall Joffre in 1915 , few surmised that this onetime Prime Minister of France would soon be immured at Malmaison . Last week however all France knew-and laughed in the knowledge-that M. Le Senateur Louis Klotz , onetime Finance Minister in the Clemenceau War Cabinet ( 1917-20 ) had just tried desperately to prove himself fit for Malmaison-and failed . <P> To Clemenceau 's Klotz the splendid sanitarium seemed preferable to jail-where Governor Emile Moreau of the Bank of France was trying to put him . To stern Governor Moreau a forgery is a forgery , even when perpetrated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was naturally not disclosed by the Bank ; but such pressure was applied to M. Klotz that he tendered his resignation as Senator and submitted to arrest , pleading insanity , asking to be sent to Malmaison . <P> Seemingly , this single exposure toppled a whole house of frauds , painstakingly erected by M. Le Senateur Klotz . He was found to have purchased jewelry , clothing and a motor car on credit , then sold them for spot cash to meet gambling losses . All last week the music halls of Paris rang with mirth and " Klotz . . . . Klotz . . . . KLOTZ . . . . " <P> Comedians recalled that as Finance Minister M. Klotz started the slogan : " The Bosches will pay ! " That was supposed to justify the War expenditures of France , however staggering . Also , at the close of the War , Finance Minister Klotz signed a paper which enabled him to buy from the U. S.-on credit-the $400,000,000 surplus war supplies of the A. E. F. in France . Promptly M. Klotz sold this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since France has been repenting his bargain . Today one of the chief perplexities of Prime Minister Raymond Poincare is how he is ever going to pay the $400,000,000 bill signed for M. Klotz , which falls due in September , 1929 . The only alternative to paying this huge sum in cash is for France to ratify the Mellon-Berenger debt funding agreement , in which all the debts of France to the U. S. are merged and spread over 62 years . Thus far a stubborn French Parliament has refused to ratify-and the standing $400,000,000 bill is another reason why Frenchmen are unsympathetic toward Signer Klotz . <P> Throughout last week the man who wanted to stay at Malmaison sought to feign madness before a trinity of famed French psychologists , Professors Truelle , Claude and Heuyer . Their verdict : " M. Klotz presents no signs of mental illness . Nothing indicates that he was in an unbalanced condition at the moment when the acts were committed . He is therefore responsible and must render an accounting for these acts . " <P> Not to luxurious Malmaison but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When merciless reporters sought out " Tiger " Clemenceau himself , he shook his shaggy head impatiently and snarled :
