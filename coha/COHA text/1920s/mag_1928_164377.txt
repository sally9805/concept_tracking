Walter Lippman , chief editorial writer of the New York World , delivered a lecture at the University of Virginia . Said he : " I believe that the body of educators has hardly realized the power it could exercise if it chose not to endure this perpetual bullying by ignoramuses . The teachers will be slaves if they act like slaves . Weakness always tempts the bully . If they cower they will be bullied . The tragedy and absurdity of the thing is that they could so easily rally a following if they had the imagination to realize how strong they are . If they chose to say that they would not endure the intolerable indignities to which they are subjected they would very soon command a new kind of respect in the nation . Nothing can excuse or explain away spinelessness . But if the educators in the public schools have to lead a double life it is not due wholly to personal timidity . It is due to a confusion of mind .
