PROBABLY the most overworked tree on Manhattan Island is the one at Forty-second Street and Sixth Avenue . When we passed the other evening at dusk , a herd of English sparrows , estimated at more than eighty-five birds , was registered there for the night . What a location to catch a wink of sleep ! Their lullaby , however , drowned the noise of the " L. " Squabbling went on in desultory fashion , some limbs apparently being choicer than others . We tried to discover why , and concluded it was because some of them commanded a view of the magazine stand on the corner , displaying those eye-smiting periodicals of the arts and the sexes . WE have been around a lot , but we were jounced out of our accustomed calm at the Gala Premiere of " The Hollywood Revue . " The " human sign , " that array of practically nude young ladies assembled up over the sidewalk to ballyhoo for the picture , first threatened to get us down ; but the real test came inside when the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene showing orange trees in bloom . 1Ve have schooled ourselves not to cry out at such happenings , and we did n't this time . We can probably go on not doing so unless movie realism gets around to monkeying with the sense of touch . We could n't abide being caressed in accompaniment to a love scene , or being mauled and pulled about every time the hero was chevied or jostled . Too ticklish , for one thing . WELL down on the West Side in a very tranquil restaurant with waiters designed by Downier , there is a checkerboard . The place has an awning such as bartenders used to extinguish with seltzer bottles , a rudimentary privet hedge in a box , a plump proprietor who waddles like a poussah , and a chef who is a chef . Contentment and digestion reign , and no single feature of the place contributes more to its noonday calm than does the checkerboard . The guests , who are mostly regulars , do not talk business . Whatever differences they have are settled with the checkerboard ; nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in checkers ) mars the meridian tranquillity . This gives us , whose noons are terrible , an idea ; it may be that we will take to carrying a checkerboard to lunch , as a defence against persons who talk business . Perhaps it will set a fashion , to the benefit of American digestion and American business . It may even lead to outdoor restaurants , with croquet courts . Whatever it leads to , it will be an improvement . INVESTIGATING the story that street beggars make fabulous sums and ride about town at night in limousines , we watched a cripple in Times Square who sold pencils . His receipts in half an hour were seventeen cents . This results in the conclusion that in all probability he does not know a single chorus girl or own so much as a Ford . WHETHWHETHER or not it is justified , ER the feeling has grown in us that it is impolite to call a doctor in the night . Country doctors , so we understand , gladly gallop to a bedside at four o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to us  --  resent any sign of physical weakness in a patient after 6 P.M. The other evening a sudden malady seized us at eleven o'clock , but we refrained from phoning for help because we assumed that at eleven o'clock a doctor would probably be playing bridge . At midnight we were much worse , but remembered that at midnight a doctor is apt to be reading , and would not wish to be disturbed . At one , declining steadily , we lifted the phone but desisted when the thought struck us that at one o'clock a doctor is in bed . At two o'clock , with rigor mortis setting in , we conquered fear and phoned a medico . He suggested in a sleepy voice that we take some aspirin and call him in the morning . We did call him in the morning , and quietly shot him as he came through the door . Hearts and Cars WE have mentioned before the al- most hallowed warehouse of Charles C. Tough in East Seventy-third Street . There , in the same spirit in which Victorians used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them stored . We wept a tear for several , including an ancient coach equipped with wine boxes and silver-belled coaching horns . Now we learn that old automobiles , too , are objects of sentimental attachment . The old cars at Tough 's are almost as provocative of sighs as the carriages . There is an aged Renault , with special body and ornate equipment , which belonged to the late E. L. Giroux . He used . to go to Europe frequently and in the early days of the automobile determined to have a car just as elegant as those in which he saw royalty riding about . One of the Renault brothers was a friend of his and turned out for him a car of especially elaborate design . It stands now in tremendous grandeur . In the tonneau are many ornaments of gold , including a vanity-case which cost thirty-five hundred dollars . The handles of the doors arc gold swans ' necks and heads . It cost , all in all , about twenty-five thousand dollars . Mr. Giroux drove it only some thirteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died within a year after buying it . The tires lank almost new . Out of sentiment his widow , who lives in Pelham , keeps the old Renault stored , at fourteen dollars a month . Another relic is a twenty-year-old Franklin , which has been at Tough 's for nine years . The owner , T. T. Eckert , son of the former president of the Western Union , has n't been in to see it during those nine years , but he frequently pays for its storage a whole year in advance . Nothing attracts more attention or is more baffling , even to experts , than atremendous roomy car which sits in silent gloom . No visitor has yet been able to tell its make without looking at the name on the radiator . It is a Westinghouse . The famous air-brake inventor is not generally known to have built automobiles , but at one time he had about a hundred made at Havre , France . The body of this one , known as a demi-limousine , is the work of the old firm of Demarest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the headlights are acetylene . It has been in storage for thirteen years , but Mr. Tough has never seen the owner . He does n't even know who the owner is . Cheques for storage come mysteriously through Demarest 's , but they will not reveal the identity of the gentleman who has a fondness for the decrepit motorcar , further than to say he is a well-known professional man . There is , too , an outmoded Austrian Daimler , property of Mr. Gilbert C. Browne , the banker . When automobiles were a novelty , he had eleven , of different makes , but this Daimler is the only one for which he had a tender feeling . Mrs. Robert Hoe , widow of the printing-press manufacturer , now in her nineties , still makes out , in her own hand , cheques for the storage of an old machine which she no longer uses . One of the few owners who comes in to look at his cars  --  he keeps two in storage  --  is one of the Reeds , of the wealthy Pittsburgh family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EpitapA ATOMBSTONE-MAKER in Brooklyn is putting out somethingpretty catchy . He features aninscription like this : Erected by JOHN SMITH in loving memory of MARY SMITH It has proved to be a good sales-promotion idea . Inland Sea CONSERVATORY LAKE in the Park , at Seventy-second Street , has recently been drained , for cleaning , but it will be filled up again shortly , to the satisfaction of its habitues who hardly know what to do in the meantime . They are oldish codgers mostly who year in and year out keep their miniature sailing boats bobbing there . The tradition goes back to the nineties . The Whitneys and the Iselins started in there as young wen to learn the lore of sails before taking up adult-sized boats . It is not a sport of the wealthy , however . One of the most eminent of the skippers is Charles Fuhrman , who is a blacksmith . He has been rigging and shouting at his boats for twenty-five years . Bis Carrie F , which he values at three hundred and fifty dollars , is the fastest boat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Mr. Herman jaekel 's Gruff is the largest , measuring six feet in length , with a one-foot beam , and carrying thirty-six pounds of lead to hold down two thousand square inches of sail . The little boathouse , which has places for a hundred boats , is filled up just now , and there is a waiting list of forty . Most of the skippers build their own boats . in a race , they start them THE NEW YORKER 9 off , run to the other end of the lake , and start them back again . Few of the sailors know their colleagues ' names , usually identifying them by the names of their boats . Herreshoff , builder of international racing ships , regularly sends his cousin to the lake to get new ideas of design from the models in action . MENTIONING the Park reminds us of something we have been intending to set down for two years . In a few weeks now people will be coining back to town to realize that the grass is greener in the Park than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greener and more numerous . The fact is that the Central Park season lasts two weeks longer than that in the country immediately surrounding the city , and begins two weeks earlier . The reason is the heat of the city ; not the body heat of the inhabitants  --  that is inconsequential  --  but the warmth of summer which is stored up in buildings , pavements , and cobblestones . In spring it is this plus the heat from buildings with furnaces . This artificial warmth is something of a benefit here , but on the whole it is a nuisance . It keeps suspended over the city at all seasons an enormous cloud of dust from which particles constantly sift , covering everything . The grime on penthouses does n't descend from the building next door , or one in the next block , but from this cloud two thousand feet or more aloft . The Woolworth Building gets it just as badly as any other structure in town . If you want to see this cloud , you may go over to the Palisades , from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate one of the municipal engineers who provided us with the foregoing facts says it is . It contains a vast quantity of dust , many tons of it . Voice from Above AMYSTERY which grew up about the Hermann Oelrichs home at Newport this season is readily dispelled . There came to be a legend that the Oelrichses maintained , in the upper regions of their house , a scholar ? some said he was an old bearded hermit who spent all his time poring over books , who knew practically everything , and left his room only late at night for silent , meditative strolls in the moonlight , free from interruption . He was kept there , it was said , expressly for the purpose of settling any disputed point which might arise in the erudite and learned conversation of the dinner table . It is true that several such questions were settled by either Mr. or Mrs. Oelrichs simply going to the house telephone and propounding them into the transmitter . " In what century did Louis XI live ? " " In the fifteenth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it emanating from the receiver . " What was the date of his death ? " " 1483 . " Questions like that , or ones about Cesar Franck and the Wars of the Roses . The explanation is simple . The question-answerer was Mr. Edgar Montillion Woolley , formerly of the Yale faculty , really erudite , and an old friend of the Oelrichses . Sometimes he feels that he will skip a formal dinner . On such occasions , while a house guest at Newport , he dined from a tray in his room , but was glad to oblige . Critic FROM a publisher who went to the Attorney General 's office in Washington in regard to two questionable books , we find out that the government has a qualified judge of art , a Mr. O'Brien , who is an assistant attorney general . He handles most of the cases in which the question arises , " Is it art ? , " whether a picture or a book is involved . The publisher was amazed at Mr. O'Brien 's extensive knowledge of aesthetics , and frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some years ago he had been assigned to try several cases having to do with the artistic merit of paintings . He felt that , to handle these , he should he especially qualified . He took a course in art appreciation . The subject so engrossed him that he is now as much interested in it as in law , and has become an authority on art . Diagnosis VETER'VETERINARY medicine still INARY strides . A lady recently took her Scotty to a pet hospital and explained that the animal seemed depressed all the time , low in spirits . The doctor took the despondent terrier 's temperature , examined its stifles and brisket . " This dog , " he pronounced at last , " did not have enough violet rays in its youth . " Landlord NE of our little-known men of ON wealth is Albert Strunsky . He lives with his family in a fine Fifth Avenue apartment , but spends a great 10 AUGUST 2,41 I 9 2 9 many of his days and nights in the basement of a house in Washington Square South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square , and looks after their renting himself  --  does n't bother with agents , despite his reputed fortune of more than a million . Mr. Strunsky enjoys landlording . His is a story of quick success . Shortly after the war he speculated and lost a modest fortune he had made in real estate , and this with a wife and two children to support . In the extremity he borrowed a hundred dollars , bought forty dollars ' worth of talcum powder , some pale-blue bottles , and a pushcart , and went into the talcum-powder business . Within a year he was selling to nine out of ten East Side barbers . With his profits he then took a long lease on a tenement house in West Third Street . It was under the " L " and occupied by Italian families who paid eighteen dollars a month for three-room apartments . As the leases ran out , Strunsky did the rooms over in modernistic Village style , and rented them to Villagers for ten dollars a week each . Following this policy in the case of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty or more in a short time he kept on getting rid of Italian families and making room for the Intelligentsia . Three rooms that once rented for eighteen a month now brought in , by grace of a can of paint , dollar floor lamps and so on , and a shower bath to each floor , a total of a hundred and twenty dollars a month . Strunsky 's office and hangout is in the basement at 47 Washington Square South . He is frequently mistaken for the janitor but he does n't mind . He knows all his tenants by name , and all his former tenants too . The cellars of 63 , 64 , and 65 ' Washington Square South arc filled with trunks and bric-a-brac belonging to ousted occupants who owe him rent . Strunsky is a rather considerate landlord , however . He ejects people , a little sadly , after the rent is two weeks overdue , but can be persuaded to grant a fortnight 's extra grace if he likes you . In any event , he invariably gives ousted tenants a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can leave their bags and other belongings in one of his basements as long as they wish . He never throws these things out or sells them . A person who has lived in one of his houses may always return and , if hard-pressed for money , be allowed a week 's grace on the rent . He approves prospective tenants by studying their faces for " honesty . " He frequently drops in for a social call on the people who live in his houses and always goes to their icebox for a snack . It 's a little ritual , No one ever resents it . ? JOKE from Punch ; ( Two old wo- men talking ) " Well , you 've got one of them ear things for your deafness at last . That 's what I 've been telling you to do for five years . " " Oh ! That 's what you 've been telling me for five years , is it2 " Paths of Glory SUMMER is the best time for visitors at the Hall of Fame , the supervisor told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day when we were , a man and his wife and two small children , and two girls sitting under the bust of Audubon , chewing gum . Above the entrance of the hall appears the legend , " Mighty Men Who Were Of Old Men Of Renown , " needing a comma after " Old " for a hurried reading . Inside ( we had never been there before and therefore will go into detail ) , facing one another on opposite sides of a winding , bare colonnade , are arranged the bronze busts of the men honored . The callings of the giants are indicated by slabs on the floor : Authors , Educators , Preachers , and Theologians , and so on But one engineer is included. , James Buchanan Eads ; one painter , Gilbert Stuart ; one sculptor , St. Gaudens ; and one explorer , Daniel Boone . Underneath each bust is a tablet upon which is lettered what is considered the subject 's most noteworthy remark . " The common school is the greatest discovery ever made by man .

" ? Joseph Henry . The environs of the Hall of Fame are not happy . The mighty men who were of oId men of renown stare at a ramshackle boarding house , slummy dwellings , electric-light plants , and gas tanks . Mark Twain glares at the squat library of New York University . Civic Pride A MAN just back from Chicago I I says he was being shown around the Art Institute there by a guide who , at the end , proudly pointed out the bronze lions at the entrance of the building . The New York man murmured that they were very nice , but that the Library lions here are also nice . " Yes , " said the Chicagoan triumphantly , " hut these lions have the longest unsupported bronze tails in the world ! " Club Cigarettes THE cigarettes that Byrd took to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but few people remember that , or ever heard of it . In those . days Byrd 's smokes were not a matter of profound national concern , and furthermore Brook Clubs are not made and ballyhooed by a big tobacco company . They are manufactured rather quietly , by Georgopulo &; Company , 48 Stone Street , way downtown . The firm makes cigarettes for notable clubs , eminent people . It is well to know at once , in case you are a defender of Brook Clubs as being better than , say , New York Yachts or Knickerbockers , that the same blend is used for all clubs . It is also well to know that dub cigarettes are not officially on sale at tobacconists . Such counters as display them got them this way or that way , against the rules . There are a number of rules , one of which is that individuals shall order through their clubs , the clubs making a small percentage . If you thrill to specific instances , Vincent Astor gets his through the Brook - ( 'twas he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Knickerbocker or the Yacht , according to mood , and the late William Rockefeller bought his by way of the Sleepy Hollow Country Club .

He established the business twenty-five years ago , thanks largely to the enthusiasm of one of the Biddies -- the brothers do n't remember which one  --  who tried one of the cigarettes and liked it . In two months orders began to come in by the thousand . The Yacht Club was the first organization , the Colony Club the last . Clubs and persons have special devices printed on their cigarettes . Yacht clubs and yachtsmen run to flags . Some have two flags , in four different colors . James P. Warburg has a horse 's head and the name Yessir on his . The Racquet Club is the biggest customer .
