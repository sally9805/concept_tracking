Veils . This is a play about twin sisters . One of them began her career in a convent and then , troubled and restless , sought the world . The other , a criminal woman , deserted the world after an erratic career and became entirely lulled by the soft silences of the nunnery . The play veered from beautiful and sensitive writing to a moral gibberish which can best be described as nunsense . The allegorical value of its eleven episodic scenes was of no great consequence . One or two of them , notably those which attempted to reproduce the atmosphere of a Catholic retreat , were thoroughly effective . <P> <P> Twelve Thousand . Everyone knows that the web of history is spun by a spider , that wars are lost with a horseshoe nail . Therefore it is not hard to be convinced by this gentle and determined fable wherein Bruno Frank explains why it was that a greedy German prince did not sell 12,000 of his peasants to fight for England in the War of the Revolution . Piderit , the prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriot who does not wish to see these helpless mercenaries , among them his two brothers , driven away to fight a foreign war . He borrows a seal from the prince 's pretty mistress and sends a plea to King Frederick of Prussia . This just and apparently omnipotent ruler puts an end to the avaricious plot of His Serene Highness , the Prince , causing this character to have a spasm of rage . Piderit and his brothers fare , for peaceful reasons , to the wide , delicious and enduring freedom of the U. S. <P> The 12,000 drafted soldiers are not , fortunately , ever allowed an access to the stage ; there are no mob scenes or speeches from the window . But the sound of the soldiers ' voices is heard and their fifers play gay tunes in the expectation of disaster . A sputter of rockets goes up , at night , for a last and tragic parade . Confused , threatening , alive , these sounds sift into the shadowed room which is the stage ; a room in which there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the clever playing of Mary Ellis and Basil Sydney , the intimate mystery of the past . <P> <P> The Buzzard . John Collier was dead . Of that there could be no doubt whatever . But the members of the cast of Broadway 's newest murder play thought that if they pretended John Collier was still alive , his murderer would reappear to investigate . So they pretended , as hard as and as long as they could . Now and again , some one of them would claim to be the culprit until at last the true culprit admitted her identity . Then the audience , which had begun to imagine that it would have to wait for a death bed confession , trooped wearily away . There was a rumor that famed Tennis Player William Tatem Tilden Jr . would appear in The Buzzard . He went off to play tennis instead . <P>
