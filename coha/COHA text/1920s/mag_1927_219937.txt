Metropolis . Ufa , German creators of the masterpieces , Siegfried , The Last Laugh , Variety , have released what they herald as their supreme achievement , Metropolis . It is the name of a futuristic city , built on a gargantuan iron skeleton , with whole communities superimposed upon one another in prismatic vastnesses-the dwelling-place of men who live to slave for their own machines . <P> When first the huge city was flashed upon the screen , its structures stretching with geometric relentlessness into the infinite heavens , its enormous pistons thumping , dynamos roaring , cogwheels whirring , it was agreed that nothing so immense , grand , complete had ever been comprehended by the eye . For a while it seemed as if one would behold an entire civilization revealed from an Olympian vantage point , would glimpse its heart palpitating beneath steel ribs . Then the scenario took hold , reduced the magnificent spectacle to the condition of a god smothered with a dishrag . <P> The philosophical content ( since it is strongly put forward ) : Efficiency , the fiend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) thus to win the soul of man for capitalist Masterman , leads Humanity toward destruction . Humanity discovers its error , burns Efficiency at the stake , thus releases itself from industrial slavery . Understanding , sympathy , apparently , are needed to lessen the labors of man , not mechanical exactitude . Once the human impulses are unchecked by Efficiency , the milk of human kindness overflows everywhere , class distinctions are washed away in the flood , the toiler 's working day is shortened . A Harold Bell Wright mentality wrestling with a Rousseauistic sentiment might have evolved as much . <P> The dramatic substance is even shoddier . Villain Inventor chases Mary up a roof , intent upon dashing her to earth , in the manner of spiteful evildoers since Desperate Desmond . The hero pursues . During the struggle , Capitalist Masterman swears if the hero ( his son ) be spared , he will henceforth treat all workingmen like brothers , never again allow a monster like Efficiency to be created . The villain topples off the roof . With Efficiency and Invention thus disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroine 's lips , Labor and Capital strike hands , the city destroyed by evil counsel of Efficiency is to be rebuilt-how , is not divulged . Ufa might better have shut the eyes of its great cameras than permit them to reflect nonsense in such grandeur . <P> Stark Love depicts customs and manners of sequestered mountain folk , North Carolina . Director and Author Karl Brown got them to act their primitive lives before his camera . The natives use no makeup , register no artful emotions . Men sleep , hunt , fish , sleep . Women hoe , bear children , scrub dishes , chop wood , cook , clean , bear children . The men live longer . The mere projection of such crude civilization , the knowledge that it still persists among lineal descendants of American settlers is enough to make the film 's substance fascinating .
