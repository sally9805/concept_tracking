Some 1,800 fresh-faced women thronged the Waldorf Astoria Hotel , Manhattan-delegates to the 13th annual National Convention of Girl Scout Leaders . Their president , Miss Sarah Louise Arnold , made a speech to the effect that there is " more to hope for from the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts than from any other standardized form of education . " <P> Their vice president , Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover , in speeches and interviews , particularized some of the things to be hoped for : <P> " The idea is to bring a girl to the state of mind where she will look at a dirty floor in her home , not with a groan and a thought of how she may escape tidying it up . On the contrary , she will look at a dirty floor with critical eye , think how much better it will be when it is cleaned up , and set to work with the newest thing in mops and cleansers to complete the job . <P> " What is home anyway ? Is it a place where mother runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> " Or is it a place where you spend your leisure hours and a certain number of working hours cheerfully and happily together ? <P> " The Girl Scout believes it is the latter place , and she gives her best to making it so . She learns to do away with nonessentials in the home , to throw away a lot of frippery little things and to have three or four really lovely things in their place . <P> " Another splendid lesson that comes to her with scouting is the ability to play . She is not one of the girls who goes motoring in the country with the family on Sunday , helps scatter papers and tin cans around , sets the phonograph going and assails the surrounding haunts of Nature with its clamor . She knows how futile canned music can be when one may listen to a lark . <P> " Not that she decries the phonograph . There is a very definite place for it in her life . She uses it while she is scrubbing that dirty floor we spoke about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she plies the dustcloth . <P> " Do girls get as much out of their scout work as boys ? Why not ? Much the same in character is required of them . They must have courage . It takes just as much courage to stick to the housework until it is done as it does to go out and meet a bear . <P> " Girls must have as much honor as boys . More , perhaps . For fathers merely go out and meet other fathers , while mothers stay at home and instill tenets of honor in future fathers and mothers . " <P> Enthusiastic Mrs. Hoover further said : " I think Girl Scouting is the best form of self-expression there is for a girl . That is why I give so much of my time to it . There are plenty of other things I could play about with if I did not consider this the most worth-while . " <P> New Uniform . The chief item of the Girl Scout leaders ' agenda was to adopt a new uniform in place of mannish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in costumes of green wool with suede belts . The leaders delightedly voted that they should all dress that way . For Girl Scouts themselves , a pleated , roll-collared , one-piece slipover of green cotton twill was adopted , with sport hats to match .
