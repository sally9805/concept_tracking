Last week , Siegfried was performed at the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan . Wagner lovers , packed like olives , heard the great score greatly interpreted by Conductor Bodanzky , heard Frederick Schoor resonantly represent Wotan , Mme. Larsen-Todsen awake with sweet screams in her circle of fire , George Meader shiver with the impotent cunning of Mime , the dwarf . They witnessed , in addition , an accidental and well-nigh tragic incident which concerned Curt Taucher , tenor , who sang Siegfried , favorite of the Gods . <P> Tenor Taucher has , it is true , never been the favorite of Metropolitan goers . His acting has been characterized as rococo , his singing as pompous . Yet , in last week 's performance , he was singing , acting , better than ever before . The great house warmed to him , he took many curtain calls . In the last act , there was a change of scene in which the stage , masked only by volutes of steam , was transformed from " a wild region at the foot of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rock . " Taucher , about to make his exit from the former setting , took a step into the steam , trod upon emptiness , plunged down 25 feet to the mouldy basement of the Metropolitan through a trap which had just been opened to receive scenery . Stagehands , mechanics , saw Taucher 's 200-pound shape crash to the stone floor ; hurried to his aid as he incredibly rose to his feet . Supported by six strong men , suffering from a broken finger , swollen wrists , many bruises , he shouted for his sword , staggered up the iron steps and again into the circle of steam , sang with great beauty his scene with Brnnhilde Next day he read , in the columns of thitherto hostile newspapers , comments on his " superb performance , " his " consummate courage .
