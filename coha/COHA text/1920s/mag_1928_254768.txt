Two years ago Max Phillips , money maker in collars , was annoyed . He believed himself threatened with arrest for violation of the Mann Act . He sued his nephew by marriage Bernard K. Marcus , president of the Bank of United States . He believed an arrest had been " framed " to ruin him . He sued to examine the books of the Bank , in which he held stock , charging mismanagement of funds . How much of this tangle was truth and how much bad temper the world will never know . Last week the million dollar suits were discontinued with a hand shake . Poor people looked wistfully over the list of famed lawyers that had worked on the case , Charles Evans Hughes , Max D. Steuer , Hiram C. Todd , John Proctor Clarke , John W. Davis , etc . Such legal leviathans are often paid $5,000 for mere preliminary opinions . If they so wished they could exist comfortably from squabble cases , living on ire .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
