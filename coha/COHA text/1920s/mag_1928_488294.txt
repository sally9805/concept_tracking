T HE nearer the end of the Presidential campaign comes , the worse it appears . One must go far back in our history before one comes across a similar era of Know-Nothingism , or rank , passionate prejudice . Even then it seems on so small a scale as to be trifling by comparison . As we write , two weeks before the election , there is a genuine prospect that the Solid South will be broken at last . For what reason ? Some profound political principle ? Some grave question of State 's rights ? Some determination to alter a domestic or foreign policy ? Some decision to rebuke a party which has been corrupt and faithless in office ? Not at all . What has stirred the South to its depths is frankly the possibility that a Roman Catholic may be elected President . There is , of course , deep and sincere feeling on the prohibition question . Although no President can ' change the prohibition law or alter the Constitution , the prohibition forces are declaring that the principle is at stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are eagerly seeking an excuse to cover their religious prejudice , their bigotry , their total lack of understanding of that liberty of conscience and of belief which is the very cornerstone of the American republic . Not only in the South is the poison at work . Everywhere one goes in the North it is prejudice which seems to be electing Herbert Hoover  --  prejudice against the Pope ; prejudice against Tammany Hall ; prejudice against the man who waxes ungrammatical as he waxes eloquent ; prejudice against his wife because she has not enjoyed the opportunities for leisure and culture that have been the good fortune of some Presidents ' wives ; prejudice because Al Smith represents the immigrant part of our population . From a cold northern New York town near the Canadian border comes this telegram : " Mysterious night riders have just deluged this town with obscene political literature . Will The Nation not take a stand for political decency in the dirtiest political campaign ever waged in the United States ? " This is symptomatic . At Democratic headquarters there is a collection of anti-Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgarity , its crassness , and its appeal to the lowest passions . It is hard to conceive of anybody 's stooping lower . Nor is Mr. Hoover wholly escaping . Stories that he sought to become a British citizen , that he is not qualified for legal reasons , are coming into the open . It is hard to foretell what may take place between now and election , but nothing could surprise any observer who knows what is going on under the surface and has gauged the venom and - hate and passion with which the campaign is being carried on . We must confess to both disappointment and shame . Disappointment that a campaign like this could not have been kept on a decent level , and shame that our nakedness is thus exposed to the world . We can not but hang our heads when we think of the effect that all this will have upon foreign observers . They will once more say that we are a land of barbarians , and that , whenever we desist from the chase of the almighty dollar , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which led to the killing of the - witches in Salem . Indeed , it goes further back . How farare we from the days of Huss and the Inquisition ? In calmer moments , however , we can not but wonder if there are not some positive gains despite all the muck and the murk . At least we have become excited over a political campaign . We have roused ourselves from the apathy of eight and of four years ago when it seemed as if the American people would never again take anything but a languid interest in their politics ; when a party caught red-handed in corruption , in bargaining away a birthright of the American people in return for bribes and for the payment of campaign debts , could be returned to office as if its record were of the whitest . After all , we must ask ourselves whether what we are witnessing today is not merely a revelation on a large scale of the religious stupidity , blindness , and intolerance which came to light in the Scopes case and in the efforts in other States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behest of superstition , of long since outworn beliefs in miracles and the supernatural . Are we not , perhaps , profiting by the self-exposure of this campaign ? Are we not having the benefits of a cold douche to bring us to a clear-eyed vision of how backward we still are in some of the physically greatest stretches of the country ? It is something to know where we stand and what we are . Let us hope it will make some Americans realize the gravity of the evil of denying free speech , free assembly , and justice in the courts , against which The Nation has been inveighing year in and year out . They are all tied together , make no mistake . Lynching , the Ku Klux Klan , the denial to Communists of the right of peaceful meeting , as narrated by Scott Nearing elsewhere in this issue , and the bigotry of some Protestants  --  these are all of the same warp and woof . As long as they exist the American democracy is in danger . As long as they are before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its call to the ramparts with all the power that it has . It was not necessary for our subscriber quoted above to ask us to take a stand against what is going on ; that has been our historic position . It is our misfortune , however , that we have not been able , for the first time , perhaps , since the McKinley and Bryan election of 1900 , to give positive advice to our readers . Our own staff is divided in its view . There is no doubt that Norman Thomas has waged the finest campaign and that his platform far more nearly approximates the standards and ideals of The Nation than does the Democratic . But from other points of view the present emergency is so great that many will overlook everything else save the height to which the tides of prejudice have gone in order to rebuke this treason to Americanism at the polls by voting for Smith . Alas , the verdict of November 6 will not be clear-cut on any issue ! This vice of our governmental system remains  --  that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one question . The prohibitionists , the religious fanatics , the preachers of " prosperity , " the champions of the protective tariff  --  each of these and various other groups will claim the victory for itself and each will interpret it in its own way . To our readers we can again only appeal not to cast their ballots for Herbert Hoover , but to choose between Smith and Thomas , as their consciences shall dictate . How to Sell Books F j HALDEMAN-JULIUS has won a place alongside of Woolworth and Ford . During the last ten years ? he has sold more than 100,000,000 copies of his Little Blue Books and in " The First Hundred Million " ( Simon and Schuster , $3 ) he has just published a candid analysis of his methods which reveals him as an indubitable master of that great modern science which is known as " merchandising . " In a very general way he knew to begin with what he wanted  --  to sell cheap reprints of standard books  --  but within the limitations established by that purpose he was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed all the resources of a very shrewd mind to find out what that is . Beginning with nothing except a few guesses to guide him , he gradually developed an elaborate system by which the pulling power of every advertisement and the salability of every title were checked , and he acted ruthlessly upon every suggestion that his information furnished him . Every book that failed to sell the required 10,000 a year was sent to a " hospital " where its defects ( commercial , not literary ) were analyzed and doctored ; every book that failed to respond to treatment was dropped and some other , carefully selected , was substituted in its place . The classics , must be sold  --  that is the purpose of the enterprise . But what classics , under what titles , and by what methods  --  that was for the public to say . Such canniness will be called genius by some and cynicism by others , but the fact remains that the success of any similar enterprise is to the success of the Little Blue Books far less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ford . Mr. Haldeman-Julius adapted the methods of mass selling to books and as a result he actually sold books in masses . What are the lessons which he learned and what are the principles which he followed ? As one might expect they are , simple , and as one might expect they reveal that the masses respond only to very simple appeals . In general people have a passion to read about three things : sex , selfimprol7ement , and what may vaguely be called " daring " attacks upon respectability , especially religion . They will buy a book whose title suggests any of these three topics and , except in certain exceptional cases , their interest is languid in any , title which does not . Therefore , the simplest thing is to work in one or the other of the tested appeals by hook or crook , and to do so is an almost infallible remedy for any " sick " classic . In 1926 a translation of Hugo 's play sold 8,000 copies under the title " The King Enjoys Himself " ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lustful King Enjoys Himself . " If the book is such that sex interest can not possibly be suggested , then one of the other two dependable appeals must be called in . Whistler 's " Ten O'Clock " goes much better if it is called " What Art Should Mean to You " and , in general , there is something magic about the " How to " or " What You Should Know " title , so that Schopenhauer 's " Art of Controversy " and De Quincey 's " Essay on Conversation " both leaped forward when they were respectively retitled " How to Argue Logically " and " How to Improve Your Conversation . " " The Truth About " this or that also goes very well , doubtless because it faintly suggestsmore or less esoteric revelations , and so does any other suggestion of the dangerous or the forbidden . But sex remains the surest of all appeals . Gautier 's " Golden Fleece " is dead , but takes on abundant life when it is called " The Search for a Blond Mistress , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the title " A Prostitute 's Sacrifice . " Nor can it be said that the interest in sex is , like that in certain other subjects , very much more conspicuous in one section of the public than another . Readers of The Nation buy as much Voltaire as they do Nietzsche ; readers of Liberty do not ; but the two publics are almost equally interested in love . In fact , statistics reveal only one paradox . Readers of the Pathfinder ( a periodical with an almost exclusively rural circulation ) displayed more interest in " The Art of Kissing " than did the readers of the New York Times , but this is probably to be explained less by any difference in degree of interest in the subject than by the fact that New Yorkers are more likely to think they know how . A good many people will shudder at many of Mr. Haldeman-Julius 's methods , and the academic will gasp at the taste displayed in many of his rechristenings , but it is not by pleasing the academic that millions of anything whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles he does not change books and that the text of " The Lustful King Amuses Himself " is perfectly authentic . In any event , one thing is certain : The question which he-poses at the head of one of his chapters " Are Americans Afraid of Sex ? " need never be asked again . Ask rather if cats hate fish or Italians spaghetti . The answer is , in slang phrase : " They eat it up . " Britain Talks Politics I N the British general election which will take place next year , probably in June , the real struggle lies between Labor and the Conservatives . Fortunately for the British electorate , neither religion nor pseudo-prohibition will be allowed to divert attention from what the New Statesman calls a " choice between a government that drops a tear over the poor on suitable occasions and a government that hates poverty and will wage steady war upon it . " Whether any party can win a clear majority in the House of Commons is not plain . Of the 615 members of the House today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberals only 40 . Labor Party leaders are talking of an absolute majority after the election , but few observers share their optimism . To increase their membership from 160 to 308 , an absolute majority , the Laborites must win a considerable proportion of the countryside away from its Conservative allegiance , an achievement which presents as many obstacles as the capture of the rural Midwest of the United States by the Democratic Party . The highest vote that the Labor Party has ever had in the House of Commons was 192 , when Ramsay MacDonald undertook the premiership in 1924 with minority support . Since then the Liberal leaders have rejuvenated their ancient cohorts and are making a strenuous bid for Labor 's place as His Majesty 's Opposition . It would be a miracle if they emerged as the second party in the state , but they will embarrass Labor by splitting the opposition to the Baldwin regime . The Labor Party is desperately poor , while both the Liberals and Conservatives have relatively large campaign chests . Lloyd George 's famous post-war chest has been only partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much in Great Britain as in the United States . Every candidate for Parliament must deposit about $730 as a guaranty that he represents a substantial portion of the electorate , and must forfeit that deposit if he fails to poll one-eighth of the vote . It is disastrous for the Labor Party when it must deposit funds for its relatively poor candidates and then lose those funds . The one compensation for this risk is that the Labor Party is seldom forced to contest a district against a Communist candidate , since the Communist candidate is rarely willing to gamble upon his ability to win one-eighth of the electorate . In addition to its other difficulties , the Labor Party 's financial strength has been greatly depleted by the Trades Dispute Act , forbidding the automatic collection of Labor Party dues from union members . . In spite of these handicaps the Labor Party is bound to increase its membership in the House of Commons because of widespread economic discontent . The army of the unemployed , as Mr. Hobson points out elsewhere in this issue , has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate an increase to 1,324,700 . The Conservatives can not ignore this issue , because they came into power largely by making promises that they would relieve the unemployment crisis . Unemployment , a protective tariff , and the Anglo-French naval agreement are the three leading issues of the British campaign thus far . The Conservatives were badly beaten in a general election when they attacked free trade openly , but they are edging toward the protective system again in spite of their rebuke at the polls . This drift toward protection will be fought bitterly by both the Liberals and Labor . Likewise both Liberals and Labor unite in condemning the Anglo-French naval accord . If the election could be confined to foreign policy alone , the Labor Party might win a clear majority , for the Baldwin Government is unpopular after its failure to reach a solution of the disarmament deadlock at Geneva and after the Anglo-French fiasco . Ramsay MacDonald struck a popular note at the Birmingham conference of the Labor Party when he demanded that the Government accept a plan for general international disarmament in successive stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possibility of a Labor-Liberal coalition . What will Labor do if , for example , the election results in a House of Commons composed of 285 Laborites , 285 Conservatives , and 45 Liberals ? Both Labor and Liberal leaders indignantly reject the suggestion of a coalition , because militancy is " good politics " and talk of compromise at this stage would weaken the intensity of the fight for various constituencies . But it is easily imaginable that Labor might choose to enter a coalition cabinet with the Liberals , as the lesser of two evils , and work out a moderate program of next steps in economic change , with a cautious Laborite like Philip Snowden as Chancellor of the Exchequer . For the sake of the mental health of the British Labor Party we hope that it will not be offered the choice of a coalition with the Liberals . Its " reconstruction program " has already been sufficiently diluted by the necessity of compromise . Moreover , Mr. Lloyd George is not a healthful bedfellow for leaders of the proletariat . Business Is Not Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-inclusive machinery used by the public utilities to direct public opinion in their favor is relieved by humorous revelations of the gullibility of those " high-powered executives " who are supposed to be so much more efficient than executives chosen by the people could be . There was the case of Mrs. Clare Ketchum Tripp of Seattle , whose name appeared as author of monographs about the public utilities sent to the public schools of Washington and Oregon . The Oregon Public Utility Information Bureau paid her $100 a month for a " membership " in her Washington-Oregon Industries Education Bureau . ( " She called it a membership . . . . Since she called it a membership , we called it a membership , too , " testified the manager of the bureau . ) But the Oregon utility bureau wrote the monograph and paid all the costs of its publication and distribution . Judge Robert E. Healy , chief counsel for the Federal Trade Commission , could not discover just what services had been rendered by Mrs. Tripp in exchange for the $100 a month paid her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Puget Sound Light and Power Company . Of course , she made the " contacts " necessary for getting the monographs into the schools , but in other States the bureaus themselves were able to do that work . The naive Mrs. Tripp , although the monographs signed by her explained all about rate regulation and other fictions of the utility business , told the Federal Trade Commission that she thought the Interstate Commerce Commission regulated the rates of public utilities ! Mrs. Tripp 's monographs appealed to sectional prejudice by teaching the school-children that the dividends and interest paid by privately owned utilities were all paid to local citizens , and used to " swell the volume of trade , " while " without exception " bonds upon a municipal lighting plant were held by Eastern investors , " and all the money paid as interest upon these bonds each year goes out of this State . " Then there was the contribution in excess of $84,400 a year paid by the utilities to E. Hofer and Sons ' " Industrial News Bureau " of Salem , Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " editorials to all the country daily and weekly newspapers in the United States  --  some 13,000 or 14,000 publications . When new " subscriptions " came in to his bureau , the " service " was not extended . The additional money was merely used " to keep the service going . " If State commissions and boards concerned with regulating public utilities would profit by the Federal Trade Commission 's investigation of the utilities , most of the propaganda activities could be stopped with little difficulty . All these boards and commissions need to do is to examine the " operating costs " reported by the utilities , and eliminate from them such items as the $100 a month paid by the Puget Sound Light and Power Company to Mrs. Tripp , the $7,000 a year paid by the Public Service Corporation of New Jersey to Hofer 's agency , and all the other hundreds of thousands squandered by the utilities in propaganda . If the utility companies had to pay these " expenses " out of their own coffers instead of out of the consumer 's pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
