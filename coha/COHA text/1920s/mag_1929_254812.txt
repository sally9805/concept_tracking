No flowers , no music , no women-such was the Spartan order of the day in the U. S. Embassy at Paris last week , when three most solemn funeral orations were pronounced over the flag-draped coffin of Myron Timothy Herrick of Cleveland , beloved and glamor-crowned Ambassador . Greatly impressed by the fact that the late Marshal Ferdinand Foch ordered " No flowers ! " ( TIME , April 1 ) , Mr. Herrick said when his own death drew nigh , " I also want no flowers . " <P> Of course some well-meaning person smuggled a single bunch of violets onto the bier , last week , and they were not disturbed . But there was no music in the Embassy . And there were only , two women-Mme . Salambier , long the Ambassador 's social secretary , and his daughter-in-law , Mrs. Parmely Herrick . The other 400 persons who jammed to suffocation the largest room in the Embassy were all men , clad in formal mourning . <P> " Greed . " As doyen of the Corps Diplomatique , the Spanish Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornate bouquet of phrases into one of which he startlingly introduced the wasp word " greed . " <P> " Mr. Herrick , " purred Count Quiones , " like other great statesmen who refused to subscribe to that deep-rooted greed which makes duplicity and deceit the best weapons of diplomacy , never employed any other resources than those which translated his most intimate sentiments , namely , sincere affability , loyal frankness and perfect cordiality . " <P> " Star-Spangled Banner . " In taking leave of Ambassador Herrick in the name of all Frenchmen , Prime Minister Raymond Poincar saluted , " that fine and good man . . . who leaves in our memory an image which nothing can destroy ! " Movingly the grizzled " Lion of Lorraine " described again how Mr. Herrick came to him in 1914 , when the Germans were all but at the gates of Paris . " <P> In a conversation he had with me at the Elyse Palace , " declared M. Poincar , " the American Ambassador said , ' If Paris is taken , I will display our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the utmost limits of my power to protect the inhabitants against pillage and oppression . ' <P> " The tears rose in his eyes while he spoke . <P> " I assured him that France would not lay down her arms before the day of victory . . . . He looked at me silently , unwilling to lessen my hopes , held my hands in his for a time and then went away . " <P> In conclusion the Prime Minister gratefully recalled that Mr. Herrick always " sought with gentle obstinacy solutions compatible with French interests , " adding , " Ambassador Herrick regarded the achievement of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh as crowning the work to which he himself was wholly devoted . " <P> " He was my friend ! " Tears did not begin to take their silent course until General John Joseph Pershing rose , visibly shaken with grief , and managed to speak thus in a gruff voice which often grew husky : <P> " Tens of thousands of men and women have been saying in these last sad days ' Mr. Herrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought with heartfelt gratitude . He was my friend very huskily just as he was theirs .
