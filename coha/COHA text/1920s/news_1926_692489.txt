txt The House of Commons was lately en . gaged in changing the British Constitution . A bill was under discussion to make it unnecessary in the future for any member of Parliament accepting office to submit himself immediately to his constituents for re-election . That old constitutional provision dated from a time when Parliament thought it necessary to resist the Crown in possible attempts to corrupt members of Parliament by appointing them to office . But that reason long since ceased to exist . The Crown never acts today in such matters except on the advice of Ministers , and Ministers are now themselves the creation of the House of ? Commons . Meanwhile , the ancient practice has led to great inconveniences . A Prime Minister may hesitate to name the best man available for a certain office out of fear that he might not be able to win a reelection in his constituency . There is also the unnecessary burden of heavy election expenses laid upon a man who has in the old way to qualify himself fa : . office . These and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an end of the ancient custom . In the course of the , debate the-statement was made that the constitutional provision which it was proposed to alter had become in modern times ar " anomaly . " This brought from Sir MARTIN CONWAY the protest that , though he was in favor of the bill , it was not at all becaus ? it " proposed to remove certain anomalies . " He went on to say , as reported in The London Times : He was always in favor of anomalies ; lie liked them . One of the saving graces of this country was that we were nonlogical . We like anomalies , and when we had net got any , we enacted new ones . The fact that we were a nonlogical country enabled us to run democratic institutions . All the logical countries in the world , all the Latin races , and people of till kind who were troubled by logic , failed to be successful ? in running democratic institutions . The whole secret of successful democracy . was illogical anomaly . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrinaire , France of seventy-five years ago , and thanking Goo that the English were not logical . Sir MARTIN CONWAY 'S remarks were doubtless meant to be partly quizzical , but there is a stratum of fact and truth in them . The Anglo-Saxon way of political progress is by taking one ventwesome step and then stubbornly refusing to take the steps which by ail sound principles of deduction ought next to be taken . The English and Americans will pass laws which are promptly de . nounced as socialistic . Does that mean that they are ' prepared to go the whale figure of socialism ? By no means . They are content to try it on . They are will.ing  --  to wait and see . If the thing turns out well , go on avith it . If ' not , drop it . In any case , decline to admit that because you have said A you must instanter proceed to say B. It is the not very glorious , rule of thumb applied to politics , - but it certainly has shown itself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it drives furious Radicals to rage and ' despair and:falsifies the alarmist predictions of frightened Conservatives .
