" What Christian Statesmen are in the pay of Jewish financiers ? " Recently Herr Hugo Graefe , potent German landholder , propounded this question in a campaign speech and answered it himself : " My friends , I will tell you one Christian the Jews have bought ! Our Foreign Minister Dr. Gustav Stresemann has a villa and a castle given him as bribes by Jewish bankers to reveal State secrets and betray the Fatherland ! " <P> Last week the High Court at Weimar found Herr Graefe guilty of malicious slander , sentenced him to three months in jail . Indignant friends of Dr. Stresemann explained once again that his wife has a rich bachelor brother who delights to open his purse and let Frau Stresemann entertain herself , her friends , Dr. Stresemann 's friends , at lavish semi-official functions quite beyond the Stresemann means . <P> Vindicated , Dr. Stresemann opened the spring session of the Council of the League of Nations last week at Geneva , an historic session because he is the first German to preside over the council .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
