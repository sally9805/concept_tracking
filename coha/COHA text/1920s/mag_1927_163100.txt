The statecraft and the art of France have scarcely produced two things more remarkable than a certain document and the ship on which it was en route last week to Manhattan . The document proposed in a few explicit sentences that the U. S. and France pledge themselves never to go to war . <P> In Paris , Foreign Minister Aristide Briand , winner of the Nobel Peace Prize* ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) , handed the proposal , which he had personally drafted to the U. S. Ambassador . In the usual course of events Ambassador Myron Timothy Herrick would simply have sent this communication on through ordinary channels to U. S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg . He did not do so . Instead , Mr. Herrick made a gesture worthy of France and the U. S. He ordered his bags packed , took the so vital document into his personal care , and embarked on the maiden voyage of the just completed flagship of the French Line , the Ile de France ( sixth largest ship-41,000 tons ) . That Mr. Herrick had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter the effectiveness of his beau geste . <P> By so doing Mr. Herrick forcibly directed the attention of U. S. citizens to that great movement called L'Art Moderne-for the steamer Ile de France in her interior decor is the work of almost a dozen of the greatest French exponents of this new species of art-an art now available in the U. S. only through one or two of Manhattan 's smartest decorators . <P> Upon the Ile de France have labored Pierre Patou , Lalique ( perhaps the most brilliant living worker in glass ) , Sue et Mare ( among the smartest decorators in Paris ) , the daring landscapist Jaulmes , the sculptor Pommier and other chief exponents of L'Art Moderne . What did Mr. Herrick find they had done upon the Ile de France ? <P> He ate in the largest dining-room on any steamer , a vast salon , 1,000 square metres in area , * covered with a carpet which cost 1,000,000 francs , ventilated by 112 portholes . <P> Yet these statistics mattered little beside the fact that this Salon had been done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with strange , geometric , golden glass lighting by Lalique . On Sunday Mr. Herrick found that he might worship in a chapel , two stories high , done with emboine panels upon lemonwood by Nelson et Simon , who had placed upon the altar an ultra-modern crucifix in molded glass , blazing from concealed lamps . <P> Mr. Herrick , no teetotaler , may have visited the 29-foot bar , danced in the 1,000 square foot ballroom by Sue et Mare , or shot at clay rabbits in the shooting gallery . <P> Meanwhile the Ile de France sped on , driven by four turbines , at 23 knots. + Although this is slower than the 28 knot Mauretania , " fastest ship in the world , " the Ile de France will shortly be equipped with seaplanes from which hurried passengers may be shot from her deck two days before she lands . <P> The peace proposal , the ship and Mr. Herrick all constituted last week a combined gesture of amity , concord and art hard to equal . <P> *Half of the 1925 Peace Prize was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1925 prize and all of the 1926 prize were divided among Foreign Ministers Briand , Chamberlain and Stresemann . <P> *1,100 square yards . <P> +26 miles per hour .
