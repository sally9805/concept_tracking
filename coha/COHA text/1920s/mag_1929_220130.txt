For ten years Newton Diehl Baker , Wartime Secretary of War , has been running away from a Distinguished Service Medal . Last week he was finally cornered in his old office at the War Department and not once but four times was the decoration pinned upon his coat . <P> A most modest man , Mr. Baker had discouraged all efforts to recognize his services in this fashion . Since last September the medal had been waiting for him but , until last week , he kept out of Washington to avoid its acceptance . <P> With gleeful gruffness , Maj. Gen. Charles Pelot Summerall , Chief of Staff , intoned the citation : " For exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service . . . responsible for the organization , development and completion of a military program which brought success to the American arms . . . services of inestimable value to the country . " <P> Secretary of War Good pinned on the medal . Mr. Baker made one last wriggle of modesty by saying : " I deeply appreciate the honor . . . . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated but feel rather that the decoration is being conferred upon me as a representative of the War Department ... in 1918 . " <P> After the ceremony , in burst some belated cameramen who demanded and obtained a second performance . Next came the cinema cameramen , and after them the movietone men . At the last , Mr. Baker protested . " There 'll be no sound out of me . " Secretary Good started for the door , echoing : " There 'll be no sound out of me ! " General Summerall agreed to reread the citation , however , and once more Mr. Baker , mum and miserable , was declared " of inestimable value . "
