txt The ? partitioning of Turkey under the terms of the treaty signed in secret by Great Britain , France and Italy on Aug. 10 would have aroused only a languid interest in the United States had it occurred ten years ago . It is an arrangement quite in the old manner . There are spheres of influence , control of railroads , exploitation of mines , diplomatic support by all to each and each to all the three Powers in maintaining their positions in " the areas in which their special interests are recognized " ? an ancient tale told exactly in the ancient way . And a British General is to have the Presidency of Constantinople . Even now many Americans will say : " What " of it ? They will govern Turkey in " slices better than the Turk governed it " ras one nation . " That may be admitted . But what should we say if we read in the newspapers some fine morning that China , let us suppose , had been apportioned among certain of the great Powers , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months prior to its disclosure ? China interests us more than Asia Minor . We have been incredibly slow and stupid about China , too careless about her friendship and her trade . Some day we are going to be wide awake to the importance of both . Already there are enough Americans with their eyes open to point out to the rest , still dozing , that the conclusion of an agreement or treaty affecting China as this tripartite treaty of Aug. 10 affects Turkey would be a matter of instant and grave concern to us . During the campaign it was easy for our Republican friends to get expressions of disdain for the League of Nations from eminent , but usually anonymous , statesmen of the Entente Powers . Reacti9naries are everywhere indigenous . There are European statesmen who love the League as a prisoner loves his ! shackles . They yearn for a return of the ' , days when two men at a table could dis'pose of the fate of States and populations in the good old Metternich fashion . Mr. HARDN:ifs envoys and negotiators : will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap ' the League "  --  and ready to welcome " an association of : nations " free from restraints and inhil.bitions so annoying to men of clash and : ambition . Statesmen of the imperialist temper would be delighted to negotiate in that sense . Not so with responsible statesmen and . Governments . They know the influences , ; secret but none the less powerful , that are working for a return to old condi'tions . They are profoundly desirous ' that the United States enter the League , and they see , as anybody can see , the peril of delay . The true voice of Europe : ? sometimes it sounds in our ears like a ; despairing voice  --  bespeaks our full cooperation under the Covenant of justice : and peace . Here the momentum of the ? Presidential campaign , not yet fully spent , prompts to a continuing use of ex : . pressions made familiar while . the contest was waging . Senator JOHNSON insists that the League is " dead " ; Senator BORAH agrees with him . When Sen ; . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " League now deceased , " he used words that , were reminiscent rather than actual or - prophetic . Republicans of influence and : intellectual leadership among those who ' supported him have been prompted to avow their conviction that the League : lives , and that we must become a part of it . Modifications they speak of as , necessary , but it is this League , not an entirely new association , that they : would have us join . Mr. TAF'T and Mr. VICKERSHAM are Of that mind . Dr. BUT " PER says that " the membership of this " League includes the great and sympa " there peoples with whom we have just " now been associated in the conduct of - " the war . They are most anxious for " our co-operation , " and " no great movement for international co-operation " can achieve permanent success without " us . " " There must be no Article X. , " he says ; " the sound parts of the Cove " nant will be preserved and the unsound " parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican " national platform . " The publication of this treaty concerning Turkey , signed three months ago , gives proof of the need of the co-operation of nations , if the world 's peace is to be made secure . The spirit of the League Covenant demands that such pacts shall not be made at will and disclosed at leisure ; they are matters for deliberation and agreement . It may be true that something had to be done about Turkey , and done promptly . It is better that there should be three spheres of influence there in the keeping of these three great nations than that there should be but one sphere under Soviet control . But the , League was brought into being for this express use  --  that control over exposed and contentious areas should be a matter for the deliberation of all the parties in interest , and it can not be denied that the disposition to be made of the Sick Man 's estate is a concern of all civilized peoples .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
