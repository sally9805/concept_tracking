txt The shipping situation in the United States is becoming interesting . Our government in war spent three billions and , as a war measure , we became the second shipping nation in the world . Now we can neither sell ships nor sail ships . Shipping men are agreed that unless the La Follette bill ic repealed , there is little Ptture for American chipping . Great Britain and Japan under more liberal law , ran do the carrying trade and the United States will he cut out of it . Dwight Morrow with his wonderful perception and thorough study in the foreign service of the government told the Shipping Board the literal truth when the war ended . lie said : " Shipping is now $210 to $215 a ton . Sell every ship you can sell . " But the rule at Washington is. " take no responsibility . and if you do nothing you will make no mistakes . " A Shipping Board that should have seven members is now run by one and a half . Wilson will dictate and overrule , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now be sold within $25 a ton of the former price , and soon will be unsalable at over $150 a ton . Yet it is declared that the Shipping Board is still laying keels for new ships on the Pacific in the firm faith that our flag must fly on that ocean so long as there is a dollar left to maintain it . But , as the courts have just decided that the Shipping Board is a corporation to sue and be sued independent of the United States , Congress may later conclude that it can function no longer than its assets in ships hold out . At the present time . the Shipping Board , as a corporation , is losing heavily in maintenance and operation . to say nothing of building , and it is only a question of time when the sale of its assets in shipping will fail to meet its deficit . We built 456 wooden ships at various points in this country , us it matter of political expediency . In times of peace they are good for nothing , es ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were put in the tow-line . Shipping men say they might be made useful in harbors , with their engines removed and all space given over to bunkering or coal and oil storage . But who in Washington will take the responsibility of selling wooden ships , when the best hid is about 10 cents on the dollar of their cost ?
