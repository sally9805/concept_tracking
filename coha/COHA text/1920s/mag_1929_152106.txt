" Bilking , " " TubThumping " <P> Like the spiteful dwarf or pixie in a fairy tale , the Rt . Hon. Philip Snowden made all sorts of mischief , last week , in the House of Commons . He may even have lost ( or , by a strange paradox , won ) the coming General Election for his party ( Laborite ) . Insulting Frenchmen , roiling Italians , vexing U. S. statesmen and bringing tears to the eyes of His Majesty 's Foreign Secretary , Sir Austen Chamberlain , were a few of the pixie 's mischiefs . Mentally Mr. Snowden is honest , alert , fearless . Long years of suffering from a spinal affliction have warped him physically , reduced him to hobbling upon two canes , given his drawn face its ascetic pallor . If he did not lash out savagely at his enemies they might treat him with a pitying consideration which he could not endure . As Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1924 Labor Cabinet of Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald , he won a sort of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slash . He exercised that right last week most rashly when he rose to flay Chancellor Winston Churchill 's fifth and present Budget ( TIME , April 22 ) . The Chancellor ( Conservative ) had abolished the tax on tea which Englishmen have paid grumblingly since the middle of the 17th century , which American colonists refused to pay at their famed " Boston Tea Party . " Throughout England last week the retail price of tea- which Britons drink at the rate of 10 Ib. each per annum-fell fourpence a pound ( 8 ) , much to the satisfaction of poor and thrifty citizens who would ordinarily vote Laborite . Perhaps some of them will now gratefully vote Conservative . Therefore the angry Labor pixie spat at Conservative Churchill that his latest opus was a " Brib-ery Budget ! " After that-cripple or no cripple-it was Parliamentary war to the knife . Not unnaturally , Mr. Churchill , a man of flesh and gusto , who looks as if he had never spent a sick day in his life , watched keenly for a chance to catch his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snowden worked himself up to a pitch of spleen , harked back to the old debt settlements made by Chancellor Churchill with France and Italy , declared them to have involved far too heavy a British sacrifice , and fairly shouted : <P> " No more scandalous transactions have ever been carried through by a Minister of the Crown than these settlements with our foreign debtors ! ... If Italy and France can afford to pay the United States they can afford to pay us . ... <P> " I say that Russia at her worst has done nothing worse than France has done ! France has repudiated four-fifths of her national debts , and there are many British people who patriotically lent money to France during the War who have been practically ruined by France bilking her national obligations ! <P> " It was with a country like that that Churchill made his shameful settlement . Could Churchill not have made a better bargain ? America did ! " <P> Probably not even Chancellor Churchill , hunched over and intent upon the pixie , realized where all this was leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon the Balfour Note of 1922.
