He Spends His Life in the Service of Others <P> The story appears in the dramatic section of the Sunday paper that Melinda Mulch , star of the Stupidities of 1923 , keeps a canvasback duck in her dressing-room . One day the duck snaps at the leading man ; another , it escapes and is discovered in the bass viol ; finally it lays an egg and half the company pay bets to the other half . These diverting incidents the public reads intently . The interest thus aroused lures them by tens and dozens to part with $4.40 to see this bizarre Melinda Mulch-the leading lady with a leaning toward canvasback ducks . As a matter of fact - Miss Mulch has never seen a canvasback duck except during the game course as her current cloak-and-suit man nourishes her at the Ritz . Miss Mulch would be thoroughly at a loss as to the line of conduct one follows with an unroasted duck . In fact , she may be secretly annoyed . Whence , then , do these stories come ? Why , if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is the duck 's creator ? A press agent is the gentleman who keeps The Stupidities before the public . It is his business to ferret out facts about the company , fashion them into entertaining if reading , hawk them among the dramatic editors . When the facts run dry he " plants " a story . His steadfast purpose is to keep The Stupidities in the headlines . If he is successful , the patient public parts with the aforesaid $4.40 and the production thus makes money . Though the duck incident herein outlined may seem farfetched , such is not the case . During the current month a Western press agent , exploiting a cinema of whaling days , planted a full-sized cardboard whale on the top of Pike 's Peak , crawled inside it with a hundred siphons , projected the liquid in a towering stream through the creature 's nose . The mystified populace stampeded from the plains to view the curiosity . The papers carried columns . My , how the money rolled in ! Naturally , the papers are wary ; so suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " story is successful . Necessarily the press agent must be highly intelligent . He is a specialized individual , highly trained , well paid . Every successful production requires his services . He is as essential to the American theatre as the star , the manager or the patrons themselves . He is the man who spends his life getting other people 's pictures into the papers .
