To the U. S. oil industry there came last week a code of ethics . Concerning only the marketing of oil , the code consisted of 19 articles , most of which dealt with relations between " refiner , wholesaler , distributor and jobber " and the " retailer . " As gasoline is by far the most important petroleum product , particularly for U. S. consumption , the " retailer " is usually the filling station owner and the code deals chiefly with unfair methods of securing filling station distribution . It says that the wholesaler should not lease pumps , tanks or other equipment ; should not pay the retailer 's rent , put up his buildings , lease him land at nominal rentals , or loan him money . He shall not give the retailer credit concessions or rebates . In brief , the wholesaler is forbidden to make with the retailer any arrangement by which this wholesaler may put himself on a different footing from any of his competitors . <P> Some of the code provisions are striking indications of the competitive aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotteries , prizes , wheels of fortune or other games of chance shall not be used in connection with the sales of gas and motor oils . " And it is expressly stipulated that no oil company shall indulge in the practice of painting out the signs and colors of a competitor . <P> The code requests that violations of its provisions be taken up with the proper " regional committee " of the American Petroleum Institute and should also be referred to the Federal Trade Commission . Thus the oil companies , though establishing their own board of arbitration , are attempting to cooperate with , rather than to take the place of the Federal board . <P> Long-planned , muchdiscussed , the code was adopted at the ninth annual meeting of the American Petroleum Institute in Chicago . Much of it might seem to consist of regulations which have become standard practices in most industries . It should be remembered , however , that the oil industry today suffers from overproduction , with its attendant fierceness of competition among more than 3,000 established oil companies . There are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of about 3,000,000 barrels of oil . During 1926 the average daily domestic demand for crude oil was slightly over 2,000,000 barrels . Total 1926 production of about 770,000,000 barrels left a surplus of about 25,000,000 barrels . Inasmuch as the oil industry had been overproducing every year since 1918 , there were on hand large surplus stocks of oil . During 1927 , production increased to about 900,000,000 barrels . Furthermore , new wells are being constantly discovered . Only last week a new Kansas well began flowing at the rate of 7,000 barrels a day ; an Oklahoma well " came in " at 2,500 barrels a day .
