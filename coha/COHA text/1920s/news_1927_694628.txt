txt Senator FESS of Ohio had what seemed to be an incurable fixed idea . In spite of all refusals , President COOLIDGE must , should and would l 's renominated . Periodicals and newspapers " teemed " with the Fessian hallucination . The President tried to dispel it . He had hardly said Goodbye before Mr. FESS was out on the streets reading the " draft " act . Not that he loved COOLIDGE more , but that he did n't love his colleague , Senator WILLIS , enough . Mr. FESS used to be a college President . He has had dreams of being President of a good deal larger institution than Antioch . Without mitigation or remorse of voice , FRANK WILLIS announced his own candidacy . SIMEON was a little long in coming into the reservation and yielding to fate and FRANK . But he has done so at last , firmly if frostily . Should he be a candidate , as he means to be , for delegate-at-large , he would name Mr. WILLIS as first choice . Such is the salutary influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seif-estcem than in adoration of another . It is a noble mission to bring a human megaphone into the convention . One hopes that Mr. ' WILLIS 'S friends will be merciful to the subject of a recovery , though late , no less edifying . Various members of the Old Guard here and in New England who affect for other reasons the symptoms , so long manifested by Mr. FESS , ca n't be subjected at present to the same heroic treatment . Who charged these vessels of arcane wisdom with any responsibility for selecting a Republican candidate for President or obstructing directly or indirectly the fortunes of any aspirant ? Is it too much to expect that the Republican voters will take a hand , in the proceedings ; that they are capable of expressing their preference , and are somewhat more interested in it than in the manoeuvres of party officials eager to magnify themselves , jump with the cat and be sure of good seats at the patronage counter ? However it may be with eminent exemplars of the official oligarchy elsewhere , the highest regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not keep a good many New York Republicans from feeling that these veteran steerers for disaster have singular qualifications for the line of " uninstructed " delegates .
