ARMY &; NAVY <P> A doughty soldier is and has been Major-General Robert Lee Bullard , U. S. A. Retired . The record of his promotions , engagements and exploits as laconically set down in Who 's Who occupies 48 lines of fine type . Not forgotten is this item : " Wrote the famous message at the opening of the 2nd Battle of the Marne , July 1918 , which marked the turning point of the war , concluding with the words : ' We are going to counter-attack . ' " The Bullard valor is concealed beneath a mild , diminutive exterior . Yet the soldierly Bullard conscience might serve as a model for all the retired military , so often and so strongly does it move its possessor to issue grave warnings to all good citizens against the insidious dangers of peace talk and unpreparedness . <P> The Bullard warnings come , as from most of the retired military , in lectures and speeches which their author is persuaded to make before patriotic meetings or conventions . One came last week , in a Bullard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allied Trades in Manhattan . With the aid of a map , Major-General Bullard showed quickly how the U. S. might be captured by an invader once New York had fallen , as it must fall if potent defenses are not maintained . Knowing that an oldtime war-dog 's growling is often interpreted as senile jingoism , and to give his hardware-headed hearers an indisputably sound reason for wanting to see their country more heavily armed , Major-General Bullard also advanced the following argument for supporting the Cruiser Bill now pending in Congress : <P> The bill calls for 15 cruisers and an air-craft-carrier , to cost $135,000,000 . <P> This $135,000,000 would all be contributed to the business and prosperity of the whole land . " <P> Of the 48 states , 24 would supply hardware , machinery and metal work for the new ships . <P> All but one ( unnamed ) of the remaining states would furnish materials of some kind . <P> Therefore the Cruiser Bill is of vital economic importance to industry , especially to Hardware , Metals and Allied Trades .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
