M R. LIPPMANN 'S publishers do not have to scream that his " Men of Destiny " 1 is the book since Plutarch 's " Lives . " They merely indicate that Mr. Lippmann is a man of consequence . He is a connoisseur of public life . He appreciates that social politics is the behavior of a culture , and he has civilized himself accordingly . His learning is not too heavy , it is well distributed and limber . His intellectualism is not the usual desperate effort but authentic . He is a natural journalist : a shrewd detective of private motives in public life . All of which makes Mr. Lippmann a man of consequence ; of which he is quite sensible . He is not so much a professional journalist as he is a man of considerable importance . There is something in his temper which tends to make him , as the years go by , more , prominent than significant . For fourteen years he has been writing books in social theory , each one a contribution of more or less distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politics , " " Drift and Mastery , " " The Stakes of Diplomacy , " " Public Opinion , " " The Phantom Public " is no more substantive than these hazy titles . He is persuasive in the reading , but he blurs in retrospect . One comes to feel that he is more sophisticated and astute than wise , more competent than sound . Possibly lie unwittingly resents this inversion in the scale of values . His urbanity protests a little : it is a trifle pompous . A certain condescension , a touch of civilized conceit defends his observations . i The essays collected in " Men of Destiny " are no doubt intended merely as a passing show . The few papers on current issues are appropriately fugitive . Yet I think that this is Mr. Lippmann 's most revealing book . For some of these " Men of Destiny " point the reason why Mr. Lippmann never quite satisfies . Mr. Lippmann is afraid . He is afraid to venture beyond sophistication to its conclusions . He is afraid to leave the noblesse oblige of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the soap-box , not because the soap-box is a dangerous place but because it is no place for a connoisseur . And when the truth has to descend to platitude and insist that the difference between the old and the new Tammany is very large but largely unimportant , Mr. Lippmann yawns : " Tammany is . . . no worse . . . than other political machines . " Or when the truth has to rant a bit and say plainly that the friendship between Wilson and House was a friendship of convenience between a psychopathic egoist and a glorified political fixer  --  disgustingly clear in " The Intimate Papers of Colonel House " s -- -Mr . Lippmann writes twenty pages on Wilson and House to show that the truth is not quite so simple . Indeed , the whole book seems to indicate that the Wilsonian nausea left in Mr. Lippmann an anti-democratic complex rather than a revulsion- against the Wilsoniad itself . With those " Men of Destiny " in whose destiny the Open Mind never had a stake Mr. Lippmann is free and easy . With them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . $2 60. that Bryan never changed from his know-nothing radicalism in 1896 to his know-nothing fundamentalism in 1925 . To Bryan democracy was a show of hands within sight . He banked on the least common denominator of mankind , its most common ignorance . He died after gorging himself with the heavy food of a know-nothing diet , symbolic of his democratic dogma . He was a martyr to his sterling ignorance . And Mr. Lippmann wrote his best obituary . In the essay on The Kellogg Doctrine its doctrinaire emerges as a simple and bewildered man . Mr. Kellogg always looks on the verge of tears . As one of the leaders of the American bar he honestly believes that the United States Supreme Court , if it had the jurisdiction , would undoubtedly declare ' ' Ithe Mexican constitution of 1917 unconstitutional . And Nicaragua acts as though this were 1776 . He is merely tryinig to protect the Calles reginie from illegal excesses against Doheny and the Nicaraguans from failing in their dutyl by the Seligmans and Browns . What 's wrong with that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a primer in the evolution of the Monroe Doctrine for the Kellogg mind . In looking into The Greatness of Mr. Mellon Mr. Lippmann is less patient . He takes Mr. Mellon 's admirers at their word that their hero is comparable to Alexander Hamilton . He compares the two , which really is a dirty trick on Mr. Mellon . Both live in the eighteenth century . Both believe in plutocracy ' And there the awful difference begins . " The difference is that Hamilton believed in plutocracy as a means to an end ; Mr. Mellon believes in plutocracy as an end in itself . " Hamilton wanted to build a nation by eighteenth-century methods . Mr. Mellon wants rich men to grow richer by the same methods . He is not bound by time . By 1985 he proposes to collect $22,000 , - 000,000 from Europe . In the meantime he means to tax the poor more heavily than the rich , lest the rich lose their initiative in working the poor . Mr. Mellon " is a high protectionist by birth . " He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him . He reminds Mr. Lippmann of Alexander Hamilton as much as Jack Dempsey reminds him of " Julius Ca sar who for a time was champion of the world . " With Messrs . McAdoo and Borah Mr. Lippmann is more affable and cautious . Hope springs eternal in the liberal breast , and both gentlemen have raised it now and then . To Mr. McAdoo , it seems to me , Mr. Lippmann is a bit too kind . Mr. McAdoo 's worldliness , political sagacity , boldness , and high administrative gifts are shiftier than they appear in Mr. Lippmann 's sketch . Mr. McAdoo 's virtues are so dexterous that it is hard to see them . Senator Borah 's virtues , on the other hand , are so independent that it is hard to use them . The Senator is so innately and immediately independent that he is absolutely undependable . He is untrammeled even by the logic of his own convictions . The Constitution enjoins liberty , while consistent views encroach upon it . And so the Senator deems it unconstitutional to have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for Russian recognition , if they are , because it is good for revolution or for business . Mr. Borah is for Russian recognition because he does not care a hang for Russia . Mr. Lippmann points out that the Senator can afford such independence as a good-in-itself ? what Joseph Pulitzer once called such indegoddampendence  --  because being famous for his independence he sheds luster on the obscure State which keeps him in it . On the whole Mr. Lippmann thinks he is a good investment . " You will find him very useful tomorrow . " Who knows but what the law of averages may throw his views your way ? But the most significant essays in this book , because they seem to me to contribute most toward the understanding of Mr. Lippmann , are those on Mr. Mencken , Governor Smith , President Coolidge , and Sinclair Lewis . Mr. Lippmann looks at Mr. Mencken through his " Notes on Democracy . " He finds that they are " only a collection of trite and somewhat confused ideas . " Then why is Mr. Mencken so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to mind but from viscera to viscera . . You have to judge him totally , roughly , approximately , without definition , as you would a barrage of artillery , for the general destruction rather than the individual shots . " Mr. Lippmann illustrates : The most important books are often of this kind . Rousseau 's " Social Contract " and Tom Paine 's " Rights of Man " were far inferior as works of the mind to the best thoughts of the eighteenth century , but they exerted an incalculably great influence because they altered men 's prejudices . Mr. Mencken 's book is of the same sort . Italics mine . The democratic phase which began in the eighteenth century has about run its course . There is now taking place a radical change of attitude . . . toward the whole conception of popular government . In the United States Mr. Mencken is the most powerful voice announcing this change . In short , Mr. Mencken is the leader of a social revolution . Mr. Mencken , of course , is nothing of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swift and simple swing of a world-shaking brochure , but they are essentially a burlesque translation of Mr. Mencken 's personal prejudices in favor of the Rabelaisian life into the form of a social manifesto . His revolution is for the highest possible personal civilization . The counter-revolution is democracy . Hence all democrats , without distinction , are swine and lice . The effect is a huge practical joke on the last century and a half in that highly civilized preposterous vein which is Mr. Mencken 's genius . In effect , he traces the Congressional remarks of Messrs . Blease , Upshaw , and Blanton to Rousseau , Locke , and Jefferson . John Stuart Mill fought for the freedom of the Flatbush flapper . Adam Smith speaks to us through Roger Babson . Karl Marx is at the bottom of the graft in the building trades . And Luther 's ghost , I take it , pens the daily piffle of the Reverend Cadman . All this , of course , is funnier than true . Democracy is not where the blah begins , for the blah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically democratic about social stupidity , which always parades under the prevailing dogmas . Else the prophets could not have been so clairvoyant about our business men and bishops , Voltaire could not have had so much more fun even than Mr. Mencken with every one of our contemporary mountebanks , and Chekhov could not have understood Sinclair Lewis 's characters so infinitely better than Mr. Lewis . In justice to Mr. Lippmann be it said that his perspicacity plays havoc with his revolutionary interpretation of " the holy terror from Baltimore . " In one sentence Mr. Mencken is a new Tom Paine whose common sense rebels against our social order . In the next sentence he is a sophisticated Stephen Leacock whose uncommon nonsense enlivens social theory . The : essay is divided against itself because Mr. Lippmann is divided against himself . For at bottom Mr. Mencken 's joke on democracy is Mr. Lippmann 's dilemma with it . The burden of all his books on the public mind since the war and of his two essays in this volume on The Causes of Political Indifference Today and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Mencken writes of it in fun . Mr. Lippmann is obsessed by the liberal fixation that democracy is a " method " which " functions " to the degree in which everybody " participates " in it ; which is like saying that the telephone company can not function unless every operator is educated in the physics of sound and electricity . The democratic method does not differ from the social mechanism of any other social order , as Mr. Lippmann brilliantly shows in The Phantom Public : it is a fight between the " ins " and " outs " along the eternal right-center-left front ; a handful leads , a few more follow , and the rest do n't care . The significant thing about democracy is not its method but its underlying purpose : And its contemporary purpose is that the sweat of John Doe 's brow is John Doe 's business . As a purpose it is quite as simple as the soap-boxer proclaims . The methods for achieving this simple purpose in our highly complex order range from schemes for " adult education " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may choose all the way from boosting the democratic ticket to getting oneself jailed in Leavenworth . The more tiresome liberal mind is content with watching the democratic " experiment " as we are all being " educated " to " function " in it , thus raising opportunism from a means to some ends into an end-in-itself . But Mr. Lippmann is never tiresome . He tries to escape the pragmatic predicament by raising opportunism not merely into an endin-itself but by blandly calling it a revolution . And he sees in Mr. Mencken " the most powerful voice announcing " our " radical change of attitude " toward democracy because Mr. Mencken 's revolution against near-beer and for Mai-Bock is Mr. Lippmann 's revolution against the insipid Mr. Coolidge and for the colorful " Al " Smith . Mr. Lippmann is not content with the perfectly intelligent belief that Governor Smith is by all odds the most intelligent aspirant for the Presidency in either of the two old parties . Some conscionable maladjustment in him insists on glorifying this perfectly sensible belief into a revolutionary faith . Smith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Man of Destiny " whose " fate " it is " to deepen " a " conflict which is the inevitable consequence of our history . " We begin to smell in Tammany a new Jacobin Club , and in Smith a new Marat of the sidewalks of New York . Governor Smith , says Mr. Lippmann , represents the democratic urban civilization , the new immigrants who began to come about 1850 . " For seventy-five years , in spite of their vast influence in local politics , they have produced nobody who could fairly be considered for the Presidency . Now from their midst has come such a man . . . . And yet he is unavailable . By the unspoken and unwritten law he can not be nominated by any national party ( as of December , 1925 ) . " Obviously he is a revolutionary martyr . And he is a martyr not because he is Wet and Catholic . He is unavailable because the older America of town and country fears " that strange and dangerous things will come out of Babylon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his fortune . Mr. Coolidge is cool , thrifty , close-mouthed . He is canny in his sense of honor and parsimonious with his honesty . He administers the most powerful office in the world as though he were the boss of an aldermanic district . Most Americans , Mr. Lippmann observes , are spending furiously , are bent on pleasure , and administer a clerkship as though it were a great profession . Mr. Coolidge provides " this generation , which is not virtuous in that simple , dry , shrewd sense , with an immense opportunity for vicarious virtue . " He is our offering to the ancient homilies . To function as a totem of the seventies Mr. Coolidge works very hard . To do next to nothing in Csar 's job takes enormous industry and uncanny skill . It 's not a cinch to get America to yawn over the oil scandal , to revive the spirit of Jay Gould in the days of Owen Young . It takes genius to inspire the headline : " Coolidge Wins Coal Victory ; Denies He Interfered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Cal " and " Al " the difference between the older indigenous America of town and farm and the urban , mercurial , industrial , " new immigrant " America . And this difference , he indicates , is a social revolution . There was 1776 , there was the Civil War , and now we have " to face the conflict " with the new Tammany . I think that the brilliance of these two essays consists entirely in the high persuasiveness of their half-truths . Mr. Lippmann 's interpretation of Governor Smith undoubtedly explains the Governor 's difficulties as a Presidential candidate . His interpretation of President Coolidge undoubtedly explains why it was possible to popularize him into a combination of the best features of Washington and Lincoln , while in fact he combines the most characteristic defects of Buchanan and Arthur ; only at the right time . Mr. Lippmann is quite right when he says that there is an ever-widening cultural gap between the industrial , centers and the country districts . But neither Smith nor Coolidge represents the fundamental factors of this estrangement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolidge because , except in color scheme , there is none . Governor Smith represents the " new immigrants " merely in their adaptation to the old Tammany Hall under new conditions . He does not represent the urban worker excepting in so far as the reactionary trade unions misrepresent his interests in the urban Democratic machine . Governor Smith is undoubtedly above Tammany . His troubles with it indicate it . He is undoubtedly the best man in his party . But Governor Smith will win or lose the Democratic nomination on the Democratic platform , which is a facsimile of the Republican counterfeit of social issues . And President Coolidge is not President of the United States because his rent is $32.50 a month , but because he represents Big Business . Mr. Lippmann 's suavity deserts him when he gets to Sinclair Lewis . Mr. Lewis 's characters are not people but " stereotypes , " whom he kicks and abuses with sadistic joy . His realism is a grotesque verisimilitude , dogmatic , vulgar , and unfair . His wit is mere malice which pursues poor foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his pathetic pleasure at a fancy towel rack ; which hounds poor Carol Kennicott , whose only fault is that she is weak and restless and dull and ashamed of her environment , of which she is an authentic part , a little soul made less by a culture which gives her nothing to do since that 's all she can do . " There is no truth " in the portrait of Elmer Gantry , writes Mr. Lippmann . Mr. Lewis simply stole a parson 's picture from the Rogues ' Gallery . When Mr. Lippmann is annoyed he is magnificently formidable . He cruelly shows that Mr. Lewis hates Babbitt because he is one himself . Lewis sees Babbitt with the half-crazed introspective clarity of a bitter consciousness of kind , as an anti-Semitic Jew sees his fellow-Jews . The extraordinary objectivity of his types is achieved because his predominant passion is hatred of his kind . His " laughter is not comic , it is protective . " He wants to be as civilized as Mr. Mencken , but he is merely " immature , " raw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all of which makes Mr. Lewis so important . He is Babbitt disgusted with himself , Babbitt ashamed of Rotary . Babbitt wondered for a few weak moments whether he had not better quit . Lewis at least tried to " find salvation by escaping " Main Street and Zenith City . " He has just arrived in the big city . " He failed , for he made a " success " as an exhibitionist of " the provincial civilization of America . . . . He takes it with him wherever he goes . " None the less , he " has imposed his conception of America on a very considerable part of the reading and writing public . " The fact is , Mr. Lewis is a rebel . He is the only " Man of Destiny " in Mr. Lippmann 's whole collection . Mr. Lewis is at least a little man of destiny because he undoubtedly has helped to break the path for more civilized critics who will stop picking on Babbitt ; for , after all , Babbitt is merely the poor ape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will stop hounding Carol Kennicott in her cheap unhappiness , the more tragic for its cheapness , and show her that the difference between her moon-calf liberalism and the liberalism to which she aspires is a step not worth taking . They will even have pity on the hairy Esau of an Elmer Gantry , and be more interested in the modernist Jacobs of the church who after all are cheating him of his birthright in exploiting human ignorance . Conceivably , they may even show that Mr. Lewis 's types are but the moron victims crowding at the right wing of a culture at whose enlightened left wing Mr. Lippmann sits as a connoisseur and critical apologist . We all have to live in the culture of which we are a part and to accept a good deal of the world in which we eat . Nor can there be a moral obligation to feel a sense of social justice . That Mr. Lippmann has become an apologist for the status giro is , after all , his personal affair . What is rather annoying about his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , insisting that the National Child Labor Amendment is even more dangerous to democracy than to the National Manufacturers ' Association ; telling the world that " Al " Smith is the leader of a social revolution ; solemnly warning Mexico that Mr. Morrow is not merely a most intelligent man , which is quite true and quite sufficient to make him an excellent ambassador under the circumstances , but that he represents the most progressive spirit in America , which is bunk ; and suggesting a life sentence for Sacco and Vanzetti , apparently on the theory that a living tomb is a liberal compromise with murder . Sophists aim to win while philosophers want to know the truth , said Socrates . Mr. Lippmann is a successful man whose observations current events constantly refute . He takes the democratic dogma of the eighteenth century and brilliantly finds it wanting under plutocratic corruption and hypocrisy ; while the news columns of the paper whose editorials are in his charge report every day the world war which is still going ma " to make the world safe for democracy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Empire , on the continent of Europe , and even in the subways of New York .
