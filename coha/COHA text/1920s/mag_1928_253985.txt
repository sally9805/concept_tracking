Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh has not flown from England to Australia in a series of hops lasting 15 days . That feat was performed by Australian Aviator Harold ( " Bert " ) Kinkier . Last week , at Canberra the new Capital of Australia , a renowned British financier compared the feats of " Lindy " with those of " Bert . " <P> The financier is Rt . Hon. Sir Robert Stevenson Home , a Director of the Suez Canal Co. , of Lloyd 's Bank , and of the Great Western Railway Co . During 1921-22 Sir Robert became the " complete financier " by achieving the office of British Chancellor of the Exchequer . Last week he boldly said that Airman Hinklers flight constitutes " the greatest single achievement in the history of aviation . " He added that Airman Hinkler has " outclassed " Airman Lindbergh.
