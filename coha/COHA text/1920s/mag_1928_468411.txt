CERTAIN Siberian tribes believe in secondary local gods , and in the power of the priesthood to influence them . When something unusual turns up in the order of nature , such as the outbreak of a plague , for instance , the people expect the shaman to rise to the occasion with his regular formula of noisy incantations . There is no record , I believe , of the efficacy of this method , but one may say without irreverence , I think , that it is in some respects open to criticism . As far as one can see , it takes no account of the possibility that a plague may have physical causes largely in control of the laity themselves , or that certain physical circumstances , also controllable , tend powerfully to keep a plague going . Second , there seems no natural relation of cause and effect between the incantations and the results they are supposed to produce . Third , the system seems presumptuous . Assuming the possibility of divine intervention in human affairs , as one easily may and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mere routine of invoking divine intervention against a fresh plague without having opened one 's mind to the lessons taught by the last one . On the other hand , the conveniences of the system are considerable ; they are quite enough to account for its persistence . First , the people do not have to think ; they merely assent . The shaman himself does not have to think ; he merely goes through certain stated motions . This is a great gain . What is a littlerun of plague once in a while compared with the comfort of emancipation into a completely stagnant mind ? Even if the plague carries off a great many people , what of it ? Most of them , if they had free choice , would rather die than think . Again , by simply trusting things to the shaman , the people can roll all responsibility off themselves , and we all know how sweet that is . They can continue in their gladsome plague-breeding , plague-fostering habits , and when the plague returns look to the shaman to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is easy when the alternative is the terrific job of living all the time in intelligent decency . Finally , plagues are not continuous , but recurrent , and after one has burned itself out there is always a chance that the next one may lie a long time on the tap of the gods . II Certain aspects of what in our modesty we agree to call civilized society make it appear that the heathen in his blindness has a good deal to say for himself . I can discern absolutely nothing in the foregoing that is not a bedrock characteristic of our civilized approach to the problem of international peace . Some projects for peace-by-fiat have lately been put before us by Senator Borah and others ; and their only actual merit is their witness once more to the mighty truth that superstition dies hard . Mr. Borah 's method with war is like his method with whiskey-sellingforbid it ; make it a criminal offense , unjustifiable under any circumstances , and substitute a codification of international law , with compulsory recourse for arbitration to an independent international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only observe that there is quite as much to be said for his method with war as for his method with whiskeyselling . Senator Capper has taken a leaf out of the late Mr. Bryan 's commonplace-book , and would dispose of war by a set of international agreements not to fight , quite as if the world were not already littered up with noisome vestiges of all manner of international agreements . The French Foreign Minister has held out an olive-branch of this kind to Mr. Kellogg ; and as I write this there is a great deal of newspaper-talk about Mr. Kellogg 's willingness to accept it , and even to go farther by inviting similar arrangements with Great Britain and other nations . Well , one tries hard not to be cynical , but one simply can not help remarking that there is an election coming on , and that a gesture of this kind would beckon out a good many votes . It is no disparagement of Mr. Kellogg 's interest in peace to say that if I were in his place I should make this gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would any reader of this magazine if he were similarly situated . As an old Scots metaphysician said of an opponent 's arguments , Mr. Borah 's proposals and Mr. Capper 's are only " cauld kail made het again " except for a fantastic rider attached to Mr. Borah 's , to the effect that every nation should be encouraged to bind itself to indict and punish its own international war breeders and war profiteers ! One rubs one 's eyes at this and asks oneself if Arcadia can possibly be located somewhere in Idaho . Mr. Burton of Ohio , too , comes out with a somewhat analogous proposal of closing the American munitions market to any nation that breaks its agreement not to go to war , leaving to the President the uncommonly delicate task of determiningwhich nation is the culprit in any given instance ! Ten years puts a mighty strain on any politician 's memory , yet if Mr. Borah and Mr. Burton made a great effort , might they not be able to see how these naive suggestions look in the light of conditions preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Surely no other criticism of them would be needed . Another suggestion is the rather indefinite one that the United States should formulate for itself a constructive foreign policy based on co-operation instead of on force . Its advocates complain that our present foreign policy is " nebulous " ? which , considering their own proposal , seems one of the oddest charges they could bring ? and that while we talk a good deal about peace we decline to co-operate with the rest of the nations " in a common effort to make world peace secure . " In reply , it is quite sufficient to observe that the United States is the one country in the world which is estopped by its Constitution from having a foreign policy which is either constructive or continuous . Our foreign policy is in the hands of our representatives , and our Constitution provides that these representatives must reside in the districts which they represent . Therefore , as politicians , they can not formulate a foreign policy with reference to the nation as a whole ; they must keep a careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borah , for example , is chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , but he keeps his seat in the Senate only by grace of the votes of the people of Idaho ; and this ties his hands . If he represented an English constituency which disagreed with him on some point of foreign policy , and ousted him , he could at once hunt up some other constituency anywhere in the United Kingdom that he could find one likely to agree with him , and stand for re-election . If Idaho ousts him he must either recant or stay ousted . Thus our foreign policy may not perhaps be so well described as nebulousthough it is that ? as improvised . It is a series of improvisations , and under our constitutional system it can not be anything else . Complaints against it on this score , therefore , are nugatory . A letter written to President Roosevelt in 1903 by Senator Lodge , a predecessor of Mr. Borah on the Foreign Relations Committee , shows exactly the principle on which our foreign policy is and must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imperialist economic interests in the Far East , especially ( as far as American interests were concerned ) in Manchuria and Mongolia . " I have been thinking a great deal about Manchuria , " Mr. Lodge wrote . " Our trade there is assuming very large proportions , and it seems to me we ought to take very strong grounds . . . . I have had letters from Lawrence , where some of the mills make cotton goods which go to Manchuria , urging the strongest possible action , and then that a fleet be sent . " III One can see at a glance how completely all these plans , projects , and suggestions correspond with the theory and practice of shamanism in the three essential particulars laid down at the outset of this paper . One sees the same correspondence in the work of all the endless societies and associations for the promotion of peace . The Carnegie Peace Foundation is as shamanistic as Senator Borah himself . All these peace movements and peace proposals persistently shirk the causes of war and the conditions that promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those causes and conditions , and are persistently presumptuous in pretending a possible efficacy of their plans against future wars , while showing no semblance of having opened their mind to the most patent and obvious lessons taught by preceding wars . One of our newspapers , presumably well informed , says that what Messrs . Borah , Capper , and Burton really wantis general public discussion of the policy of the United States in respect to war , not only in Congress , but in the press and at public meetings . This statement is what . has heartened me to say my humble say about their peace plans ; and I hope it is true . Nay , I believe that it is true , provided the discussion be carried on within the well-established limits of a strict shamanistic orthodoxy . No doubt these gentlemen would gladly welcome , and the press gladly publish , any discussion that did not impugn the essentials of shamanism or the specific value and appropriateness of shamanistic practices . I am not quite clear about their willingness to go beyond this . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of one set of incantations over another . Even the shamans themselves might take a hand . But if someone showed cause for the thesis that no sort of incantations amounted to anything against a plague , and that the way really to get at the matter was quite different ? well , one is not so sure . If he went farther , if he put it to the Eskimos that , in the premises , their faith in shamanism was a great disservice to their own interests , and that a pretense of efficacy for really inert practices was of dubious morality , it is ten to one that he would be treated to the " one plain argument " with which Lord Peter surmounted the skepticism of his brethren in Swift 's Tale of a Tub ; which , being far from books , I quote from memory , " " lo convince you , ' cried Lord Peter , holding up the crust of bread which he declared had been miraculously transformed into a shoulder of mutton ? to convince you , I will use but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural good mutton , as any that was ever bought in Leadenhall market ; and if you do not believe it , God damn you and yours to all eternity ! ' Such a thundering proof as this , " concludes Swift , dryly , " left no room for further objection . " Lord Peter 's sense of logic is , in fact , vividly recalled by the discussion of disarmament at Geneva last autumn . The Russian Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , Litvinov , appeared before the League of Nations with a proposal for complete and simultaneous universal disarmament . This , of course , would of itself not end war ; Litvinov never pretended that it would . Plenty of peoples have gone to war with homemade slings and arrows , and they could do so again ; they could go to war armed with fiatirons and hoe-handles , for that matter . But it would he a substantial expression of the much-advertised desire for peace , and a considerable guarantee of good faith ; and Litvinov represents , it is said , the second largest army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great majority of press opinion the world over contented itself with rehearsing Lord Peter 's " one plain argument " in different keys . One of our newspapers , for instance , which makes some dubious pretensions to editorial character , said summarily that " the Russian proposal reeks with hypocrisy . . . . Litvinov was obviously playing a game . " Well , but if one can be as sure of Litvinov as all that , and really concerned to make other people equally sure , why not rap for a show-down on his little bluff ? This is as convincing a procedure in diplomacy as it is in drawpoker . Merely blackguarding the Russian proposals butters no parsnips ; showing them up would butter all the parsnips there are . This incident helps to direct the imagination in forecasting what might befall anyone who ventured to carry a discussion of international peace beyond the limits set by a safe and sane shamanistic orthodoxy . Let us suppose a case . We all know the Williams College Institute of Politics . Probably , since peace plans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will devote some part of its sessions next summer to the subject of peace . Suppose it should invite someone to give a thoroughly realistic treatment of the thesis that " nations in general will goto war whenever there is a prospect of getting anything by it . " If the speaker did even a moderately honest job , we should be likely to hear a good deal of Lord Peter 's " one plain argument " against the economic interpretation of history and against Bolshevist detraction of statesmen 's motives . The arcana of shamanism are so sacred , the devotee 's faith in them is so anxious , that the merest motion of a finger towards them provokes alarm . Yet , curiously , the parentage of this thesis gives the Institute a clear title to its use . The man who laid it down was of a type that has appeared only two or three times in American public life . He was no halflettered and incendiary disciple of Marx , but a man of profound learning and the most austere integrity , an aristocrat of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detestation . The basis of his political system , in his own words , was that " those who own the country should govern the country . " Surely that ought to be good enough for Williams College and Mr. Baruch . He was our first Secretary for Foreign Affairs under the Articles of Confederation , the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court , Governor of New York , and the best American Englishman whom President Washington could find in the whole country to send to London to negotiate the treaty of 1795 , elarum et venerabile nomen , John Jay . But not all this glory and renown , one fears , would save his thesis a single scurrility if it were seriously propounded at Williamstown next summer . Yet this thesis is fundamental to the question of peace , even though propounding it were ever so subversive of shamanism . There never was a war in human history that did not have its gestation in some project of economic gain at someone else 's expense . If Messrs . Borah , Burton , and Capper will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back every word I say and subscribe to their peace-projects . Moreover , I am willing to take all chances that the economic intention of any war that may be cited is not clearly demonstrable . I am careful to specify intention , not pretext ; for it is a rather significant fact , I think , that no war has ever been fought in America , and none in modern Europe , except upon some pretext that the mere passage of time has differentiated sharply from its actual intention . The barbarian wars , as they are called , were avowedly organized for plunder ; no one pretended otherwise ; but never a modern war . The economic intention of our earlier wars has become a commonplace of history ; the frontier war , the Revolution , the Indian and Mexican Wars , the War of 1861 . The intention of the Spanish War , and of the informal and private executive wars in the Caribbean and in the Central American regions , such as the one going on in Nicaragua while I write these lines , is unfortunately obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unusual circumstances , of the economic origins of the late European war , and the economic bearings of our share in it . Lamentable as the facts are , they are not without their humor when seen in retrospect . One would bargain off one 's chances of salvation , almost , for the sake of attending a decennial reunion of the American warpropagandists of 1917 , under the chairmanship , say , of Dr. Henry van Dyke . What would it not be worth to see an assemblage of the clergymen , professors , bankers , three-minute men , publicists , and editors who distinguished themselves so manfully ten years ago ; to observe their behavior in one another 's presence , and hear what they could find to say to one another ? But this treat will not come off ; and Messrs . Borah , Burton , and Capper might learn a good deal about the prolegomena of peace by examining into the reasons why it will not come off . Iv It is useful now to take a brief survey of what is being actually done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Government has set up a complete ring of military alliances around the remains of the late Central Powers . The last treaty to be signed was with Jugoslavia ; it gives the French a military hegemony straight down from the Baltic Sea to the foot of the Adriatic . The astute French Foreign Minister was reported as saying the other day that this treaty was quite innocent , that it was the mere formal registration of a long existent friendship , and conceived throughout in the spirit of Locarno ; which last led an irreverent Austrian paragrapher to remark that there seemed to be no reason now why we should not have a good rousing Locarno war . The Italian Government ? I think rightly ? suspects the French of designs on making Italian influence play second fiddle in the Danube States and on the Mediterranean ; so the Italian Foreign Office strengthened its position by a treaty with Albania , which would now play a part in regional diplomacy and in war somewhat like that played by Belgium in the last war . Coming to another group , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany should take on a settled anti-Bismarckian policy towards Russia . Perhaps Germany might get hack some " mandated " territory by so doing , maybe a slice of her former possessions in Africa , for instance . A friend of mine in Germany , a banker , remarked to me two years ago that " the time is probably coming when a certain country will need help pretty badly , and then Germany will get a good price for her soldiers . " Sir Austen Chamberlain might also do something very decent for Mussolini ? something like letting him have a free go in Albania , perhaps ? in return for a similar settled anti-Russian policy . This is no mere disagreeable innuendo ; in Sir Austen 's place , who would n't ? Politicians are always realistic ; there is no politics but Realpolitik ; so why should those who observe them not be realistic too ? As for the United States Government , it seems to have started in on about the program for " defense " that was to be expected . It has every valid reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . American production , in the first place , is geared to a large and rapidly increasing volume of foreign trade , which we can not get and keep except at the expense of other industrial and carrying nations ; and we all know what that means . Second , we have an unconscionable lot of debts out , both public and private , and their sum represents an economic accumulation that would he quite worth confiscating " on the side . " It is repeated and repeated in many quarters that war with England is " unthinkable . " It is not unthinkable , because I can think of it , and if I am the only person who can I want the credit of it . I have heard that kind of talk before . I can remember when good-will delegations used to cross between Germany and England by whole platoons , and when alI the speeches of all the dignitaries on both sides were pitched to the same key . There was a good show of reason for it , too , because Germany was England 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other economic considerations that outweighed this one , or were thought to outweigh it . I agree , I can not think of England 's attacking the United States out of hand any more than in 1911 I could think of her attacking Germany out of hand . But it is no trouble at all for me to think of the United States being suddenly shorn of her outlying possessions by a group of nations acting together , with England either as a silent partner or . if necessary , " coming in " ; I can think of American production under a stroke of apoplexy through disorganization of trade-routes ; and I can think of a great many billion dollars ' worth of debts due to us , public and private , being automatically annulled as an act of war . In fact , the one thing I can not think of , in the premises , is a single goodreason for not seeing that the last war left the United States , in the new alignment of nationalist economic interests , exactly in the position that Germany occupied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expose me to the cheap and easy slur that I am a Thompsonite who takes a mean pleasure in twisting the lion 's tail . Let me take shelter behind Mr. Tomlinson , whose spirited paper in the December HARPER 'S I so much admire , and whose sentiments are in every respect my own . Mr. Tomlinson makes no bones of intimating that his Government is the docile bond servant of certain special interests , and I can say the same thing of my own Government without reservation . I ask Mr. Tomlinson , then , to imagine himself in Mr. Kellogg 's position , while I try to imagine myself in Sir Austen Chamberlain 's . How would matters look to us , and what should we do ? The interests behind Mr. Tomlinson-Kellogg wish to hold and consolidate their gains , collect their debts , and extend their markets . The interests behind Mr. Nock-Chamberlain would like to arrange a modus vivendi or , as we say , " go in cahoots . " Mr. Tomlinson-Kellogg 's interests are indisposed to that , owing to an apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nock-Chamberlain would certainly carry forward the traditional Foreign Office policy to cover the case , regarding it as the best and cheapest from the standpoint of the interests that he serves . This seems to have been the policy that was carried forward in the years preceding 1914 , according to the candid confessions of some who had part in it . Can Mr. Tomlinson say that in the view of the interests concerned , this policy would not be again justified if carried out by a combination of debtor nations ? I can not say so . Mr. Tomlinson does not mention noticing that these interests were at all disserved by it in 1914 , and in one place he seems to intimate the contrary . Would they be worse served if it were put in force again ? The public debt would be annulled by an act of war , and the private debts confiscated as alien property , as England confiscated ( and still holds ) alien property in the last war . I do not know what these private debts amount to , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increasing at a rate of nearly two billion dollars a year . All this would be some gain . Probably enough of our extra-continental possessions could be picked up to make the venture worth while ; at least , it would cost us so much to protect them , and at the same time to protect our coast and our trade-routes , that it would be money in our pocket , as a matter of military policy , to let them go , though our politicians would undoubtedly not have sense enough to do so . Mr. Tomlinson foresees correctly that we should be very badly off for being set upon by the right combination of debtor peoples ; but does his imagination not fail a little when he foresees that our enemies ? meaning always the special interests behind the diplomacy and guns ? would fare as badly ? V Here at last we are brought in sight of the real trouble with our peace plans . All our prospects for peace are permitted to hang on the works and ways of men who serve , and who must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , but on the contrary , against it . Any major collision of those interests , any interference with them , results inevitably in war , provided there is , or is thought to be , " something to be got by it . " Even so admirable and experienced a person as Mr. Arthur Ponsonby loses sight of this when he offers his plan for " disarmament by example , " in the Contemporary Review . He says that " no nation , no Government , no statesman , would be a party to " aggression upon a country which had openly repudiated the idea of ever resorting toforce . Mr. Ponsonby does not know my country ; a country , I regret to say , that has not hit a man of anywhere near its size since 1812 . We have carried on a long string of unprovoked aggressions , and are still carrying them on ? the papers this morning report a mobilization of our forces in Nicaragua ? against utterly defenseless peoples . Mr , Ponsonby has surely heard of Perry 's expedition , our Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of the Spanish War , in which we simply sandbagged a preposterously helpless country out of its valuable insular possessions . As a citizen of the United States I appreciate the compliment implied in Mr. Ponsonby 's plan , but I can not accept it . The point is , as Sir Henry CampbellBannerman once said , that it is vain to seek peace unless you also ensue it . Every plan of our politicians , and every demarehe of our peace-societies , contemplates just this impossible thing . It is a plan to have one 's cake and yet to eat it ; and any pretense that such a plan can succeed , any adventitious prestige given to such a plan , is simon-pure shamanism . But on the showing of Mr. Tomlinson and Mr. Ponsonby themselves , politicians can do no better , and obviously the peace-societies can not . This is by no means to say that our politicians and peace-propagandists are necessarily scoundrels . If society commissioned Pougatchev , Razin , Dick Turpin , Claude Duval , Robin Hood , and Jesse James to devise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well know what we should get . Yet this does not necessarily imply that these men are scoundrels , or that they would at in deliberate bad faith . Those who have read Count Tolstoy 's novel Resurrection , and who remember his masterly analysis of the prostitute Maslova 's view of her trade , and of its place in the social order , will easily understand that such an implication would be gratuitous and unwarranted . Pougatchev and his associates , like Maslova , and Iike all the rest of us , would necessarily proceed on the one and only theory of social organization that they understood ; and hence , whatever plan they devised must fall within the scope of that theory . Our politicians are in precisely the same case . It is permissible to point out , however , that the social theory held by Pougatchev ( who seems , by the way , according to Poushkin , to have been quite something of a patriot ) or the theory held by Maslova , is not accepted by the best reason and spirit of mankind as competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a theory is misleading ; and finally , that people who labor under the disabilities of that theory are distinctly the wrong sort to be entrusted with the determination of matters upon which that theory may have play . Just this may be said of the efforts of our politicians and our peace societies ; it is all that can be fairly said , and it is all that need be said . The establishment of permanent peace presupposes an entire revision of the purposes and functions of politica/ government . More than this , it presupposes a radical revision of our existing economic system . A pretense for anything short of this is a mere reversion to shamanism ; and our politicians and our peace societies are simply incapable of contemplating anything of the kind . That is the sum of the matter . If the idea can be entertained in other quarters , let us hear about it . Perhaps Mr. Tomlinson 's loathing of war may move him to look into the matter and broach it for us ; I hope so . But at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who are neither politicians nor propagandists , be realistic about war . If we are unable or indisposed to examine the causes and conditions of war , and to speak in terms of those causes and conditions , let us be silent and leave the subject . If we can not talk sense , let us promote a salutary surcease of nonsense . Whatever may be said about the justice of hauling Admiral Plunkett over the coals for war-mongering , he is miles ahead of his critics in having put his finger firmly on the invariable causes of war ; and in this respect , if no other , his utterances were worthy of a very devout consideration . I close with a parable told me long ago by Lincoln Steffens . This gregarious soul once wandered into the company of some clergymen who were talking about original sin ; they were speculating upon the story of Adam and Eve , and trying to make out where sin came from , who was to blame for it , and what emdd be done about it . Presently they asked Steffens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't agree with any of you . I do n't blame Eve or Adam or God or the devil . I blame the apple . If the apple had n't been there , nobody would have sinned . In regard to sin nowadays , and what can be done about it , I am of the same mind . I suggest taking away the apple . If you take away the apple , people wo n't sin . "
