txt The Late James L. Ford . I was interested in Tire TIMES editorial on James Laurens Ford . How can one do justice to his heroic spirit that has gone to a reward which must , Indeed , be great If it Is to compensate for the bitter misfortune that , in his later days , wrecked his body but could not break his will ? I wish some golden pen might write the record of those later days . There surely would be inspiration for the sick-at-heart and the afflicted in the example of high resolve and sublime courage of the man . And yet Jim Ford would have laughed at the idea of being called a hero , and would have indignantly denied that life had not paid him in full . In truth few men have got so much from living . Nevertheless , to us who knew him ho was a hero , for we know what the loss of sight and motion meant to a man whose greatest joy must have been to look Into the eyes of his friends and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure delight  --  a joyous benediction . One basked in the sunlight of his presence and never did the monstrous afflictions which the brutal hand of fate had meted out to him ever intrude upon those visits . For every physical deprivation his triumphant spirit seemed to take to itself a double toll of sweetness and light . Who ever visited that cheerful little cottage in Brookhaven and did not come away invigorated by the cool , refreshing breath of his personality ? If ever a man was master of his fate and captain of his soul that man was James Laurens Ford . WALTER P. HENSHAW . Gladstone , N. J. , Feb. 28 , 1028R
