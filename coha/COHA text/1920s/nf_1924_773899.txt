txt // " I should n't mind housekeeping if it were not for planning the meals " ? how often have we heard this ? There is a sort of inevitableness about meals which makes them seem truly awful at times . A hungry family and nothing on the table is terrible to contemplate . But routine ( drudgery if you will ) loses much of its depressing power when our work gains significance . To see the children rosy , the family accounts free from doctor 's bills , and an atmosphere of serenity in the home are surely compensations for time and thought given to family meals . The Construction of the Menu There is a steady demand for menus , and they are always suggestive . But they seldom fit the case exactly . They depend on times and seasons , localities and pocketbooks , community customs and individual notions , as well as the states of health and size of families and ages of their members . Hence menus can not be made wholesale and slavishly followed . The examples which have been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types which one may find in a family group are designed to illustrate principles and may be greatly modified without any sacrifice of nutritive value . A meal may be reduced to a single kind of food material or it may contain many kinds of food and many dishes . If there is only one kind of food used , the menu is no problem . So the baby , each of whose meals is alike , is not the one the mother has in mind when she worries about " planning meals . " Nor are normal young chilFOOD // dren up to at least four or five years of age much cause of concern on this account ; their food is limited in variety and their meals vary little from day to day . It is when the choice of food materials becomes practically unlimited , when selecting for the older children and adults , that the menu looms large , and from this point of view it will be first discussed . Types of Meal Plans One great help in the daily task is the standardization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will have to be determined for each family group according to its food needs . If the adults are all sedentary , and have ample noon meals , breakfast may be very light : fruit , some kind of breadstuff , as toast or rolls , and a beverage , as coffee , cocoa , or milk . Or it may be light : fruit , cereal , breadstuff , beverage . If , however , the workers take little food at midday , it may be wise to increase it to medium : fruit , cereal , eggs or meat , breadstuff , beverage . If the workers are engaged actively in muscular pursuits , and their total intake for the day must be high , the breakfast may be medium or heavy : fruit , cereal , eggs or meat , one other hot dish , breadstuff , beverage . For the mixed family group , where the adults are not very active muscularly , the " light " breakfast is the most convenient type , as it provides at the same time the essentials of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an egg or serving of bacon can be added without much extra labor . On the other hand , the sedentary person eating // in a group of active muscular workers can pass by the extra dishes and confine himself to the " light " or " medium " breakfast , the " heavy " type being quite unsuited to his needs . Similarly , various plans present themselves for luncheon and dinner , or for dinner and supper , as the case may be . As a general rule , digestion is better when there is at least one hot dish at a meal . This may be a beverage , and luncheon consist of a beverage and sandwiches . Thus peanut butter sandwiches and cocoa are perfectly practical for a luncheon yielding 700 to Boo calories per capita . Or the hot dish may be a soup , and again sandwiches used to supplement it . Or the hot dish may be a chowder , macaroni and cheese , some creamed dish on toast , and the like , served with bread and butter and a beverage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lettuce or other greens , is always desirable . These simple types of luncheon are suited to the sedentary worker , but can be made more pleasing to the palate by the addition of a simple dessert ? stewed or fresh fruit , charlotte russe , blancmange . Another type of luncheon , still suitable for the sedentary , consists of soup , some other hot dish , such as mentioned above , bread and butter and dessert , to which a beverage may or may not be added . This can be easily varied by substituting a salad for the hot dish ? giving a type of luncheon especially wholesome and attractive to sedentary women . For the active worker , especially if engaged out of doors , for whom food must be liberally // provided , one or two hot dishes , a substantial dessert ( as pie ) and a hot beverage , with bread and butter , will give as satisfactory results as a greater variety , if the dishes are high in fuel value . More formal luncheons resemble dinners in type . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat and a vegetable ) , which may be combined and served as one at times , bread and butter , and a dessert , with or without any beverage but water . The addition of another vegetable will make this more pleasing and almost always better balanced . Where it does not involve too much labor , dinner is very happily begun with soup . As already said , this stimulates gastric secretion , the warmth is refreshing , and one is in better condition to enjoy the rest of the dinner with the edge taken off hunger without blunting the appetite . A soup , three hot dishes , a salad , dessert , and beverage , with bread and butter , make a meal elaborate enough for any family . In fact , one of the reasons for difficulty in menu making is the tendency to put too many dishes into one meal . We may apply to foods as well as to house furnishings William Morris 's dictum , " Nothing is beautiful which is not also useful . " An added dish should serve a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green vegetable is a desirable part of any dinner menu , but two green vegetables unless one is raw and the other cooked offer no enhancement to each other and rarely add anything to the effect not already accomplished by one , and one might just as well eat two servings of one as one serving of each of two kinds . Every duplication // of this kind makes it so much the more difficult to pros vide the sauce of variety for the next time . Foods of mild flavor and the same general texture and color , such as potatoes , rice , macaroni , samp or hominy , and other cereals , serve as " fillers-in " or carriers of calories , whereas other foods of more striking characteristics give piquancy to the meal . There is no particular advantage in multiplying such fillers-in . Served one at a time , they produce a better effect than when several are used together . When these are multiplied , there is always the likelihood that green vegetables , cooked or raw , will be omitted because there are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same class with the cereals because of their richness in the B and C vitamins , iron and some other ash constituents , but while they may well be used at least once a day , it seems more artistic not to serve them in the same course with rice or macaroni . Often the dessert furnishes the most energy of any single dish , amounting to as much as 300 or 400 calories per serving . When the first part of the meal is not very high in fuel value , this is all very well ; but when " heavy " desserts are not needed to bring up the total fuel value of the meal , a salad or fruit will leave a pleasant impression upon the diners , at the same time relieving the cook of work and making the meal better balanced . Food Combinations from the Scientific Standpoint " What foods go well together ? " Many housewives seem to think that there are laws on this point as unFOOD // alterable as those of the Medes and Persians . As a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an Englishman or an Esquimaux , a Bostonian or a Bengali . Reverend S. Hall Young , recounting his experiences with John Muir in Alaska , tells what difficulty they had , when they were entertained by the Indians , to keep their food from being drenched with a sauce of seal oil ? a special delicacy to their hosts , which tasted very disagreeable to them . A Chinaman does not put sugar on his rice nor in his tea , but what American housewife would omit to offer sugar with both , unless she were serving rice as a " vegetable " ? a habit too little in vogue ? The study of food combinations is like the old definition of arithmetic , " both a science and an art . " As a science it relates chiefly to the promotion of digestibility and the representation of the different food elements in the diet . It has been pointed out in Chapter II that digestion is more likely to be satisfactory for the adult when the meal is not limited to a single food material . Thus bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A meal composed mainly of carbohydrate material leaves the stomach too quickly to suit ordinary meal schedules , and so does one entirely fluid . A meal of fat alone would offer a staggering proposition to an ordinary appetite , and if eaten would digest slowly , giving no zest for another meal soon . A meal of protein alone might have some advantages in an Arctic climate , since it would stimulate heat production and help to give feelings of warmth , but this would be most disadvantageous // in warmer regions . All together , man finds himself more comfortable with proteins , fats , and carbohydrates well represented in each meal , starch predominating . Since we need such a variety of substances and our everyday method of getting these is somewhat hit-or-miss , we shall insure hitting oftener than missing by the general plan of adding fruit at least once a day , a green vegetable at least once a day , and milk totaling at least a pint a day . It is desirable to keep the fuel value of any regular meal essentially the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further and see that some foods furnishing iron , phosphorus , and calcium , the A , B , and C vitamins and " ballast " in the form of cellulose are regularly provided for . Let us not have a feast and upset our digestions by overeating to-day , and have a famine to-morrow , but stoke the furnace regularly , according to its needs . Herein lies the advantage of knowing the relative fuel value of different foods and different dishes . It will keep us from serving to-day a cream soup , a fat meat , sweet potatoes ( perhaps glazed , with increase in fuel value ) , a vegetable with Hollandaise sauce , a salad with mayonnaise dressing , and ice cream with a chocolate sauce ? all dishes very high in fuel ; and to-morrow a bouillon , a lean fish , riced potatoes , sliced tomatoes without dressing , and fruit for dessert ? a meal which may have only half the fuel value of the first one ? unless we have good reason for making such a change . ' // Foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be massed in the same day , or , more particularly , in the same meal . Even though the family enjoys griddle cakes , pork chops , fried potatoes , and plum pudding , do not provide them all on the same day , but spread them over four days in combination with other foods easier to digest . Thus , we might have cantaloupe , grape nuts , and griddle cakes for breakfast one day ; tomato soup , cold roast beef , fried potatoes , apple float , and cookies for luncheon another day ; and pork chops , mashed potatoes , string beans , orange salad , and caramel custard for dinner another day , thus giving the enjoyment of these more difficult foods under circumstances favorable to their digestion , and making it possible , where there are children , to provide for them without an entirely different menu ; for of course these dishes , so hard to digest , would be withheld from children entirely . Dishes which contain large amounts of fat and protein are always slow of digestioi and should be eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayonnaise dressing , eaten with bread and butter ( the butter in moderation ) , may make an acceptable luncheon , but if we add a cup of rich chocolate with whipped cream , the chances of a good appetite for dinner are decreased ; unless the person is active and out of doors , the effect is apt to be bad in the long run , if a headache does not immediately follow . Foods which are fried in small pieces , so as to be well loaded with fat , are to be used sparingly and in combination with those having little or no fat . Thus , fried potatoes " go with " lean meat // like beef or mutton , and not with fat pork or bacon . Foods fried in large pieces are not necessarily loaded with fat , but their texture is often objectionable . This is the case with fritters , hot doughnuts , and the like . They form pasty masses like other hot breads , and should not be used in the same meal with such breads , pastry , or rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will serve to dilute them . Thus cheese , a con centrated protein food , is served with crackers , or com bined with a white sauce and served on toast ; or mixed with macaroni , rice , hominy , bread , etc. , in various dishes . Eaten in this way , it loses its reputation for being indigestible . Butter , a concentrated fat food , is eaten with bread or potatoes ; foods mildly sweetened with sugar are more wholesome than rich preserves , cake , or candy . Small portions of many foods can be well borne where larger ones would do harm , because they are diluted by the rest of the meal . Foods which stimulate digestive juices should precede those which are negative or tend to retard the flow . Thus , soup precedes other foods ; meat is also served near the beginning of the meal . Foods which promote appetite are placed early in the meal , as fresh fruit for breakfast . Sweets , which dull appetite , should be reserved till the last . Some people are sensitive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be explained only by some peculiarity of the individual . Impressions that certain combinations do not agree are often based on // very little evidence ; but if repeated and unprejudiced experiments give always the same result , the troublesome combination should , of course , be avoided by that person . Sometimes the trouble comes from putting together too concentrated foods . Acids taken with much sweet milk to drink tend to make the milk form hard curds in the stomach , which of course interferes with digestion , but when a little acid is combined with the milk and the curd kept from forming a mass , as in lemon milk sherbet or cream of tomato soup , the product is easy to digest . Catsups , pickles , and highly spiced or very sweet foods of all sorts are irritating to the delicate walls of the alimentary tract and should be used sparingly by the robust , never by invalids , children , or any of delicate digestion . Food Combinations from the Esthetic Standpoint A balanced meal does not necessarily mean an artistic one . Graham bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for months , but most people would find it uninteresting in a few days and actually palling on the appetite in a week or two . The human being exhibits two psychological tendencies in his diet ? one , to stand by the old favorites ; the other , to demand variety from day to day . A very radical change in diet is apt to upset digestion . Foreigners suffer from the strange food in a new country as much as from lack of other familiar associations . Some one has said that acclimatization is largely a matter of get230 FEEDING THE FAMILY ting used to the food , and certainly this is an important part . So we find a diet made up of certain staples , like bread and butter , milk and potatoes , welcomed daily , along with variables of all sorts , which help to keep up the appetite as well as to insure the presence of the different food elements required by the body . The menu maker needs to steer a medium course ; to recognize this love of variety and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A well-balanced diet , even if monotonous , will be more satisfying in the long run than an ill-balanced one . The first thing to see to , then , as already indicated , is that the different food elements are represented each day in some form . Then attention may be turned to that variety which comes from differences in form , color , flavor , and texture of foods , so prized by the expert in gastronomics . The aim of the artist is to arrange a meal not only wholesome , but a joy to all the senses . So long as beauty is a part of life , and the spirit more than meat , the housewife will take pride in assembling her family about a board which delights the eye and " makes the mouth water . " Her great care must be , if this spirit is strong in her , to see that she does not sacrifice real body welfare to the eye and the palate . Not all have a natural gift for making artistic or novel food combinations , and many have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to a good hotel , restaurant , or tea room , with careful study of the table d'h8te menus , will often furnish new ideas for the home table . So to exchange meals with a neighbor and to compare notes on menus is interesting and instructive . // Most home magazines furnish menus , and these may well be kept as an aid when one 's own ingenuity fails . But there are a few working principles which may at least keep one from committing great gastronomic blunders , and really help in securing a well-balanced diet from day to day . In the first place , take the day as a unit in planning rather than the single meal ; or , better still , plan for the week or the month ; at least remember that there should be some variation from week to week and month to month . In the country , the natural procession of the seasons helps to secure this wider variety . In the city , where hothouse products or those from other districts press close on the heels of those from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of . But here one should learn to use the maximum amount for the year in the height of a given food 's season . We may , for instance , serve cantaloupe in New York from April to November , but it is better for artistic as well as economic reasons to limit our freest use of the melon to August and September , when it is likely to be at its best . Impressions carry over strongly from one meal to the next and from one day to the next . So , with the exception of certain staples ( usually mild in character ) , such as bread , butter , milk , and the like , try to avoid serving any food in the same form twice in the same day , and , better still , avoid repeating it the same day in any form . When storage facilities are poor and perishable food has to be used up quickly , of course such a rule can not be rigidly adhered to . And in the country , where a crop // like strawberries must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of variety is gotten chiefly by varying the form in which the food is served . Thus , we may have plain , unhulled berries surrounding a mound of sugar for breakfast , a berry float for luncheon , and a sherbet for dinner , and get a very different impression from each meal . So the country housewife welcomes the little book of Apples in One Hundred Ways and others of its kind , whereas the city housekeeper , who has perhaps ten or fifteen kinds of fruit at her command at one time , may get her variety simply by changing the species , and is less concerned with different ways of preparing each kind . In fact , she is foolish to spend time in making elaborate dishes when she can get her variety so largely by careful marketing . Another good rule is to avoid serving a food which gives its pronounced character to a dish twice in the same meal , even in different forms . How often we see tomato soup , tomato catsup , and tomato salad on the same dinner table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with onions , and perhaps onions served as a vegetable also . Care should be taken in cookery to develop the natural flavor of each kind of food , and to add extra flavors sparingly , so that they may be fully enjoyed when they are used . Serving meals in courses helps to heighten artistic effect , and is often easier than getting everything on the table at once . Courses should contrast with one another ; a bland one , then a more highly flavored one ; a hot one and then a cold one ; a fluid one and then a // solid one . The last course should have a pleasant aftertaste . This is especially emphasized in a formal meal like dinner . Some people prefer a sweet dessert , others cheese , still others coffee or fruit . Individual courses may consist of one or more dishes . In general , the larger the number of courses , the simpler each one should be . A meal may consist of a single course and still be artistic in effect , exhibiting contrasts and harmonies within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and butter , coffee , and fruit not only make a satisfying meal , but show contrasts of form , as between the potato balls and the steak ; of color , emphasized by the cress and the fruit ; of texture , part being good to chew , part soft , part crisp , and part succulent . On the other hand , a meal composed of cheese fondue , sweet potatoes , creamed carrots , baked bananas , and bread and butter would be equally good from the nutritive point of view , but would weary the eye by sameness of color and the palate by sameness of texture and , to some extent , of flavor . Many popular combinations offer sharp contrasts in texture ? crackers and cheese , tea and toast , ice cream and cake ; in fact , this kind of contrast seems to play almost as important a part in creating a pleasing effect as good combinations of flavor . Of the latter , there are many familiar examples ; cranberry or other acid fruit sauce with fowl and game , mint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cheese or beef . But it is a mistake to adhere too closely to conventional combinations . Gooseberries are quite as pleasing with chicken as are cran234 FEEDING THE FAMILY berries ; apples are good with beef , and delicious with sweet potatoes ; many combinations may be devised which give pleasing effects and make the often used foods seem " different . " One secret in the happy use of leftovers is to place them in entirely different surroundings from those in which they were first served ; in another meal , perhaps , or at least with other kinds of food . Thus , macaroni served creamed with roast beef for dinner , if not all used , may be made into croquettes and served for luncheon with a cheese sauce . Allowing a considerable interval of time between repetitions of the same dish is another help in creating a sense of novelty . If possible , keep to-day 's leftovers till day after tomorrow ; repeat a favorite food once in ten days or two weeks , instead of regularly every week . Even changing the dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident effect on the appetites of the family . Mrs. Richards , in one of her numerous " dietary surveys , " found the girls of a certain school refusing en masse a dessert served in a large baking dish . It was put away till next day , turned out in a fine mold , and the girls not only ate it , but demanded more ! A consideration of the menu ? the selection and service of foods in a meal ? is worth while because it will help the housewife to make her family eat the foods which they ought to have . Skill in cookery and genius in food combination are only means to this end . The ideal meal is a simple one ? whether of one or several courses ? in which the different types of food are harmoniously represented , but not repeated , and in which food accessories , such as // pickles , spices , preserves , and the like , are little needed because the foods themselves are well cooked and each contributes its own characteristic flavor , texture , form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Summer and Winter Menus Spells of hot weather have always been accounted disastrous to babies . The well-organized infant welfare work of some of our larger cities has taken account of the fact that more babies die in July and August than in other months of the year and makes preparation for a regular summer campaign for the purpose of remedying this sad condition . While its activities include all kinds of hygienic measures ? cleanliness , protection from flies , suitable clothing , etc. ? the matter which receives most attention , as most important , is that of food . With this properly supplied , illness and death both decrease strikingly . In the case of older children and adults , hot weather does not work such havoc , but it does render every one more susceptible to nutritional disturbances and it is well to recognize this in planning the family meals . Sudden and extreme changes in the weather are especially trying and often go unsuspected as the cause of digestive difficulties . When the temperature suddenly drops after a few days of intense heat ( especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers that several prominent men have been stricken about the same time with acute indigestion , and remarks on the coincidence , especially if a number of one 's own acquaintances are // having the same experience . It is quite likely that the weather is at least in part to blame , and one should be particularly cautious about dietary indiscretions and chill when the thermometer is falling rapidly in the summer time . Before the days of canning and cold storage it was often quite difficult to have much variety in the winter diet , especially towards spring , when the supply of home preserved fruits and vegetables began to give out . Salt meats and potatoes many times formed the bulk of the ration , and undoubtedly some of the ash constituents and vitamins were not very well represented , the value of milk as a supplement to such a diet being quite unrealized . So it came about that a low nutritional state was expected with the warm ( lays of spring , and dosing with " treacle and sulphur " was not limited to Mrs. Squeers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly improved facilities for a rational diet throughout the year , fruits and green vegetables , canned if not actually fresh , take the place of " blood medicines , " and one may expect to be as healthy in the spring as at any other time of year . But warm days do bring a muscular relaxation which reacts on the digestive tract as well as the rest of the body , and it needs to have its task lightened somewhat , if we do not wish to run the risk of an upset . While increases in atmospheric temperature do not affect the activities which go on internally , the amount of energy transformed in muscular work is apt to be more or less unconsciously reduced , and it is well to diminish the energy intake somewhat . Even if muscular work goes // on as in cold weather , there is apt to be a lessened muscular tension in sleep , or when resting , and even if there were not , it would be wise to eat a little less for a few days till the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food there should go care to choose those things which are most likely to prove easy of digestion ? simple dishes and not too many kinds in any one meal . Foods rich in fat , which , as we have seen , is of all the foodstuffs the most likely to retard digestion , should be withheld ? pastries , cakes , sauces , and gravies . Hot breads , particularly with syrups or honey , are especially liable to fermentation at such a time . Protein foods , which , as already pointed out , most deserve the term " heating foods , " should be used in moderation . The diet should consist of a very moderate allowance of lean meat , or its equivalent in eggs , cheese , milk , or other meat substitute ; vegetables very simply cooked , as baked potatoes , boiled onions , quickly cooked cabbage ; or served as crisp salads dressed with French dressing , cream dressing ( cream and vinegar ) , or merely a little vinegar and seasonings ; fruits , cooked when there is any doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to disagree , and eaten in moderation . Cold desserts , of gelatin , cornstarch , tapioca , or frozen custard or fruit juices , are not only easy of digestion , but refreshing . If taken slowly at the end of a meal , frozen dishes will not chill the stomach unduly . This is much better than icing the stomach at the soda fountain between meals . If it is impossible to resist its temptations , it is much better to take a plain soda or // phosphate , lemonade , iced tea , or grape juice , than to indulge in ice cream sodas or sundaes . In any case , care should be taken not to drink cold beverages rapidly when warm . The shock to the nerves of the stomach is never good , and may be very severe . Since the body goes on generating heat at the same rate internally whether the weather be hot or not , the problem of physical comfort in the summer time is one of getting rid of the heat generated . Any physical activity , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding atmosphere . We may facilitate this heat loss by lighter clothing , by fanning , by cooling baths , or by inducing perspiration if conditions are favorable for its speedy evaporation . This is the reason hot beverages prove cooling to some . On clays when the humidity is high this method will not work . The warm beverage will only add to the tota discomfort . Cold beverages will take body heat to warm them in the stomach and will carry away body heat when their water is eliminated , and therefore they are very valuable if not taken too cold or too fast . Another factor in nutrition in warm weather is the fact that bacteria flourish at an amazing rate , and extra care must be taken to guard against spoiled food . Even in the refrigerator there is not always safety . Many ice boxes are so poorly constructed that their temperature rises with that of the surrounding air , and food is poorly protected . Especial care should be taken of protein foods , such as meat and milk . In planning a menu for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eating habits can not be radically changed on short notice , without danger of a digestive upset . It is not well to give a person accustomed to hot food entirely cold meals . One hot dish can be provided without much difficulty ? a beverage if nothing else . The following are suggested as illustrating good ? types of summer menus : Table // Table In cold weather any excess of food beyond immediate needs is apt to be taken care of with greater ease than in summer , and energy requirements often are slightly higher , as cold stimulates to higher muscular tension and greater physical activity . This does not apply , of course , FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : MENUS 24r to one who lives in hot , close rooms at summer temperature during the winter months . Most people get enough stimulus from the cold to have a little better appetite and a little higher food requirement in winter than in summer . But the most marked difference is usually in digestive power . Dishes may safely appear in the winter menu which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sausage , doughnuts , baked beans , and mince pie are commonly recognized as winter foods , though it is well to remember that even then they have little place in the dietary of sedentary persons . The man who goes to work out of doors on an icy morning will find a breakfast of fried mush and sausage well suited to his needs . He can digest fat meats and other kinds of food rich in fat without any trouble . A liberal supply of protein will help to give him a feeling of warmth , and the conditions of outdoor life usually insure him against harm from an excess of nitrogenous waste products , though in special cases an excess of meat may cause trouble . Esquimaux thrive on a diet in which protein may contribute 40 per cent of the total energy value of the diet , and turn the heating properties of the protein to good account in the severe cold , whereas in a warmer climate such high protein would be at least a waste of good fuel , if not actually harmful . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither to overtax his digestive system nor to overeat , and children must be protected in winter as well as summer against rich and heavy food . // Table // Table CHAPTER XIII FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : COST OF FOOD IT is comparatively easy to plan attractive menus if one does not have to count the cost of materials nor of the labor required in preparation and service , though , of course , it can never be done without some time and thought . With plenty of money , the great danger is in the line of over-elaboration , which is not only inartistic , but tempts to overeating and waste of food . It is better to gratify one 's esthetic taste by excellence of quality in food and service than by a multiplicity of dishes . Especially to be shunned arc dishes made overrich with cream and butter , which are not only expensive but upset digestion . For most people , cost is a large factor in the feeding problem ; from one-half to one-fourth of the family income has to be devoted to buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage which must be so spent . Fortunately beyond a certain minimum there is no vital connection between nutritive value and cost . Nutritious and expensive are not synonymous ; in fact , some of the most nutritious foods are the cheapest . Cost alone is , therefore , a poor guide for the housewife 244 // in determining what she will feed her family . She needs to know some of the factors which influence the cost of food in order to make wise selection , especially if she has to try continually to make one dollar do the work of two . Factors in the Market Cost of Food One of the factors in the cost of food is the amount of labor and price of material required to produce it . A potato is cheap , and one will produce several dozen with very little work on the part of the planter . Hence potatoes rank as cheap food . Fish , which forage for themselves and have only to be caught and brought to market , make cheap meat . Under pioneer conditions meat is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when grain has to be raised to feed cattle for beef , the cost of the animal 's food and care makes meat dear . In this country the passing of the great western grazing fields increased the cost of beef , and our present hope of keeping this kind of food within reach of our pocketbooks lies in the utilization of the vast plains of South America , where food for the animals may still be had for nothing . Meat from Argentine can not , however , be as cheap as that caught near one 's own door , because of the cost of transportation . Cost of transportation played a small part in domestic economy before the days of express or fast freight and refrigerator cars . But to-day we bring together in one market apples from Oregon , melons from California , olive oil from Spain ? food products from almost every // quarter of the globe  --  and the expense of this transportation must be added to the original cost of production . The cost of foods out of season is very largely due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of facilities for transportation , many foods deteriorate in transit , and any percentage of loss must also be added to their cost . So perishability becomes another factor to be reckoned with . If a carload of peaches goes to market , and half of them spoil before they reach the retail buyer , she will have to pay twice as much for what she gets as she would if they had all kept perfectly . Cereal products , dried foods of various kinds , potatoes , onions , and other foods which keep very well are always cheap as compared with strawberries , raspberries , lettuce , and the like , which require careful handling and will not keep long under the most favorable conditions . With the development of cold storage , perishability is not so great a factor as formerly , but we still have to add the storage charge , and to take into account the fact that foods taken out of cold storage deteriorate with extra speed , so that the cost can not be as low as for fresh goods delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perishability and makes transportation of food products simpler , but one must pay for the labor involved in the process as well as the materials , so that canned goods are to be ranked as intermediate in price between dried foods and fresh ones , at least under city conditions . The way in which goods are put up for the market will affect the cost . Package goods are more expensive // than the same material in bulk ; small packages cost more in proportion than large ones ; fancy wrappers often bring a fancy price . Elegant shops and immediate delivery add materially to the original cost . The extra charge for package goods is often worth paying , because greater cleanliness is assured , and sealing keeps the material in better condition , to say nothing of the greater ease of storage at home . A small package is a better investment than a large one , if part of the large one would spoil before it could be used up . But these things should be realized by the purchaser . Twenty-five cents invested in two jars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other io , will yield to ounces of food , while a single 25 cent jar will contain 12 ounces , so that one saves over four cents ( a gain of 20 per cent ) on the larger purchase . Each housekeeper must decide for herself where the danger of loss and inconvenience of storage counterbalance the gain from large quantity buying , but the tendency in cities is to buy in unnecessarily small quantities , not only because storage space is precious , but because it is so easy to replenish one 's larder quickly . In the country , where space is available , there may be the opposite danger of buying in such large quantities that the food either deteriorates before it is used up , or a great deal of extra care must be given to keep it in proper condition . Many foods bring high prices because of the esthetic appeal which they make to the consumer . Size and shape , color , flavor , and texture all play their parts in this appeal . Tender beef is preferred to tough , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender , the law of supply and demand sends up the price . Large red apples are more attractive than small green ones , though the latter may actually have a better flavor . Olive oil is preferred to cottonseed on account of the difference in flavor , though the nutritive value is the same . In some markets white eggs are preferred to brown . It is hard to separate this idea of esthetic appeal from nutritive value . We are all inclined to think the foods which we like are good for us , and ap-pearance and flavor attract or repel very quickly ; but so far as real nourishment goes , these things are second-ary , and the household provider must be able to dis-criminate between real nutritive value and other factors , in order to spend her money to the best advantage . Just as the finest-looking food of a given kind may not give the best return in nutritive value for the money spent , the cheapest form of the same goods may be an equally bad investment . A peck of apples so small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in paring and coring may be dearer than larger ones at a little higher price . A pound of prunes in which there is little flesh and much skin and stone may be bought for eight or ten cents , but will be satisfactory neither as regards nutritive value nor flavor ; one will get a better return on one 's money by spending for this fruit at least 12 or 15 , or preferably 20 , cents a pound . A piece . of corned beef at 18 cents a pound may have so much bone and fat that the lean cooked meat will have cost fully 50 cents per pound , while a rump roast of beef at // 25 cents a pound will yield lean cooked meat costing only 35 cents per pound . Unless the fat of the corned beef is eaten , it will not be as economical a purchase as the roast , though the first cost is less and the total number of calories per pound is greater . Fat meat is never profitable unless the fat is used for food . Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that either the dearest or cheapest in food is the best to buy . The first cost gives no direct clue to the real part which a food will play in the domestic economy , and different conditions of living must determine what it is wise to buy . Nevertheless we shall have to know the cost of the various essentials of the diet in order to formulate a working program which will most conveniently apportion our money so that due allowance is made for each . Since the energy supply is the largest item in the cost of food and since the easiest way to study cost of food is in relation to its fuel value , all considerations of cost in this book are related to calories . In the words of Armsby , one of the world 's great investigators in the field of nutrition , " The up-to-date housewife riseth early while it is yet night ' and giveth calories unto her household . " That such emphasis is justifiable he makes clear by saying , " While it is true that a due supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally essential , it is not from the present standpoint equally important , since comparatively slight modifications in a diet supplying sufficient energy can ordinarily // remedy deficiencies in this respect . For this reason modern studies of human dietaries give prominence to the energy relations . " If our food allowance is liberal and the fuel require ment of our family low , we may indulge more freely in food materials purely for their esthetic appeal . But if we are trying to make every cent go as far as it will to-ward supplying actual nourishment , we must think , not only in terms of market conditions and our own task , but of absolute nutritive value . As Professor Graham Lusk has so often earnestly pointed out , it would be a great advantage to the purchaser if the manufac turers of all kinds of package goods would not only in dicate the nature of the contents ( as they are now re quired by law to do ) , but also say , " This package con tains ? calories of which  --  are protein . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then see some-thing like this : // The most casual inspection of the above shows that of all these cereal products rolled oats gives the best return for the money . Even taking into account that it requires long , slow cooking , it is cheaper than one of the cheapest ready-to-eat cereals cornflakes . It may be perfectly legitimate to serve puffed wheat now and then , but it should be with full consciousness that one is paying about three-fourths for a special mode of preparation and one-fourth for actual fuel value . In canned ' goods there is a great amount of difference in fuel value , even with the same kind of food , owing to differences in the amount of water used to fill up the can and in the amount of sugar in sweetened products . At present the only way for the housewife to protect herself is to make her own observations on the amount of " solids " which she gets for her money , the richness of the syrup , etc. , and buy those brands which give the best values . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better seen than in a comparison of milk with other high protein foods . A quart of milk yielding 675 calories and costing , let us say 15 cents , is the equiva-lent in fuel value of about one pound of lean round steak , costing over 40 cents , or of nine eggs , which would be cheap at 30 cents . Even more striking is the case of oysters . A quart of solid oysters is equivalent in fuel to one quart of milk , but will cost from three to four times as much as milk at 15 cents per quart . // For ordinary purposes of comparison , the loo-calorie portion serves as a most convenient unit , and in the Appendix will be found tables ( see pp. 362 and 385 ) classifying practically all the foods used in the dietaries in this book , or regarded as common household staples . These give only the cost of food materials ; they do not include charges for fuel and labor . Good food can not be bought for nothing . There are to-day very few kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories . These are mostly cereal products , such as cornmeal , rolled oats , and flour ; fats , such as cottonseed oil , suet , lard , and lard substitutes ; sugar , molasses , and corn syrup ; and dried peas . A somewhat longer list may be had for one cent per Too calories , including cornstarch , pearl barley , and flaked wheat , dried beans , bread , raisins , and salt pork , while for from one to one and one-half cents we may extend our list to cornflakes , plain crackers , butter at 50 cents per pound , or oleomargarine , macaroni , rice , tapioca , and bacon . It will be observed that all of these foods belong to the non-perishable , easily transported class ; meat , milk , eggs , fresh fruits , and vegetables are not included . For two cents per Too calories we may add olive oil , cabbage , carrots , potatoes , dried apples and prunes , and milk at ten cents per quart . In the country , where fruits and vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater variety of food materials than this without going beyond two cents per Too calories , but in the city fresh fruits and vegetables will range from three cents per loo calories for apples , onions , and cabbage , to 20 or // 30 cents for lettuce , asparagus , celery , and melons . Most meats exceed three cents per ioo calories and choice cuts exceed five cents per ioo calories . It is by study of these relative values and judicious combinations of the inexpensive with the more costly foods that the house-wife controls her expenditure and yet provides " meals that shall be at once gratifying , satisfying , and funda mentally right . " The Cost of Protein , Ash Constituents , and Vitamins Feeding a family on a small income is no mean task . It demands intelligence and much thought , knowledge both of food values and human needs . One can not become a finished mistress of the art in a week or a year , but the reward of patient study comes , not only in the saving which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased happiness and efficiency of the well-nourished family and the personal satisfaction of ceasing to grope blindly ( which is drudgery ) and acquir ing a conscious power over one 's environment , which makes even the difficult task interesting and joyous . - So far the discussion of cost has dealt with food chiefly in relation to fuel value . But we can not rest content with learning which foods give us the most calories for our money . We must consider the price which we shall pay for building material protein , iron , calcium , phos phorus , ' etc. ; and for vitamins and other regulating factors in the diet . Sugar and oatmeal have the same fuel value per pound ( r Soo calories ) and can generally // be bought for the same price . On the basis of calories they are , therefore , equivalent . But a pound of sugar yields nothing but fuel , while a pound of oatmeal will furnish 300 of its calories in the form of protein , and will also yield nearly one-third of a gram of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man ; one and three-fourths grams of phosphorus , which gives a good margin of safety above his daily need ; and 16 one-thousandths of a gram of iron , which is a very liberal day 's supply . It will even yield considerable B vitamin , while sugar has none . We shall realize what a very cheap food oatmeal is as compared with sugar ( which seems at first equally cheap ) if we stop to consider what we shall have to pay to get from other foods the protein and ash constituents which the sugar lacks . Suppose we buy 30o protein calories in the form of lean round steak : they will cost us 33 cents , estimating the market cost of the meat as 40 cents per pound . In buying 300 protein calories from oatmeal for six cents we got 1500 additional calories ; from the meat for our 33 cents we shall get only 250 , which is small compensation for the difference in cost . From the beef we shall also get about one-tenth as much calcium as from the oatmeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-sixths as much iron . Hence , we shall have to go on spending more money to make up these missing amounts , and will begin to inquire how we can get the rest of these and our vitamin supply most cheaply . We shall find that the cheapest source of calcium is // milk , and , as milk is also rich in protein and phosphorus , it will be interesting to see with what economy we can substitute milk for beef altogether . To secure 300 pro tein calories we shall require about two and one-third quarts of milk , costing , at 15 cents per quart , 35 cents . Since 300 protein calories from beef cost 33 cents , we have come out about even on our investment for pro tein . At the same time we shall find that we have ob tained over 1200 calories in addition to our protein calories ( nearly as many as from the oatmeal ) as against a surplus of 250 calories from the meat ; 68 times as much calcium , and over three times as much phosphorus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get about half as much as from the meat , but here again the milk has the advantage that its iron is in a specially available form and more likely to be completely utilized than that of meat . Granting that we must buy some food to supply the rest of the iron , the milk will be cheaper than the meat , to supplement which we shall need to purchase calcium , phosphorus , and iron , and probably calories too . ' // In this reckoning we have not taken account of the vitamins . In the beef there will be a little B vitamin and traces of C vitamin . In the whole milk there will be a rich supply of A and B vitamins , certainly more than enough for a day for any human being , and more C vitamin than in the meat . If we had to buy vegetables and butter to supplement the vitamin shortage of meat , we should find the cost mounting very rapidly . The Cost of Protein Protein foods are , as a rule , a more expensive item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly because we like them in delicat perishable and highly flavored forms , such as meat , fish , and shell fish . From the nutritive point of view , eggs , cheese , and milk are interchangeable with them , and can usually be substituted with real economy . The grains and breadstuffs can also be depended upon to a considerable extent , having about the same proportion of protein to total fuel value that we aim to have in a well-balanced diet , i.e. , to to r5 per cent of their calories in the form of protein . We must rememFOOD // ber , of course , that the grain or legume proteins will not make an ideal amino acid assortment by themselves . They must be supplemented , and for practical purposes milk , eggs , and meat are the supplements to depend on . Scientific investigation has brought to light interesting results from the combination of different protein-bearing foods ; for example , oatmeal and gelatin ( each of poor quality by itself ) will together support growth in young // animals ; peanuts and soy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though in general mixtures of seed proteins do not serve to bring about normal growth . It is worth while to keep in mind the remarkable supplementing power of milk as shown in the diagram on page 256 . The table on page 21 shows the cost of the amounts of different food materials which will yield too protein calories , and serves as a rough measure of the relative economy of these foods as sources of protein , in spite of some difference in nutritive value . One may use milk and navy beans as the chief sources and have a mixture of excellent quality at less cost than the milk alone ; or one may choose porterhouse steak and have no more efficient a diet so far as protein is concerned ( and less efficient in minerals and vitamins ) at four or five times the cost of the beans and milk . The Cost of Calcium , Phosporus , and Iron It is worth while to compare in a similar fashion some of the foods which are the best sources of the different ash constituents , especially calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the foods are arranged in order of the amount of money required to purchase enough of any one to yield a quantity of the element under consideration sufficient to meet an adult man 's daily requirement . From an inspection of these tables it is easy to see that some foods are cheap from all points of view ; thus , // dried beans , costing less than a cent per zoo calories for fuel , are also the cheapest food for iron , third cheapest for phosphorus , and included in the cheapest five for calcium . Milk is a fairly economical source of fuel , protein , and phosphorus , exceptionally cheap for cal260 FEEDING THE FAMILY cium , and dear only for iron , a condition compensated again in part by the fact that its iron is specially good as far as it goes . Taking all these things into consideration , we must regard milk as inexpensive . This is particularly noticeable when we compare it with lean beef ( round ) , which at 40 cents a pound is just as economical // a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beef is not to be considered as a source of calcium ; is more than twice as expensive as milk as a source of phosphorus , and , while much cheaper than milk as a source of iron , it is by no means the cheapest of ironbearing foods . // The tables also show justification for the purchase of some of the green vegetables , which in general are expensive sources of fuel and protein . String beans afford cheap calcium , iron , and phosphorus ; and spinach and lettuce compare favorably with other foods as sources of iron . Eggs are hardly to be regarded as cheap from any point of view , if we compare them with peas , beans , and cereals . But if we compare them with other perishable protein food , like meat , it is evident that when they do not exceed 25 cents per dozen they may be regarded as a substitute for the cheaper cuts of meat , and when they cost as much as 40 cents per dozen they are , by the balancing of counts , cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The market price of fresh fruits varies so greatly that no attempt has been made to include them in these tables . They are negligible as regards protein , but are useful sources of the ash constituents , though as a rule more expensive than the green vegetables which have been chosen for illustration . The Cost of Vitamins It is still difficult to discuss the cost of vitamins because of our meager knowledge as to the amounts likely to occur in different food materials and as to the vitamin requirements of human beings . Certain foods have already begun to stand out , however , as rich and economical sources of these newer dietary essentials . The foremost of these is milk . The term " protective food " has been happily applied to it because its // liberal use protects against dietary deficiencies of so many sorts , and particularly of the A and B vitamins . It is quite generally agreed that a pint of milk for each child and a half pint for each adult should be set as a minimum below which no diet should fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins , Professor Sherman , says : " A quart a day for every boy baby until he is full grown and a quart a day for every girl baby until she has weaned her last child . " Since milk has already been shown to be a cheap source of protein and calcium , and since the vitamin content of milk is high , we may almost say we get out vitamins " thrown in " when we buy milk . Among the green vegetables , economies are affected by choosing those which give rich yields of all three vitamins at the same time . One of these is spinach . Its season is long and it grows easily , hence its first cost is not high as compared with other leafy vegetables . Buying it primarily for iron , of which it is an economical source , we may regard its vitamins as pure profit on the investment . A second economical green vegetable is cabbage , fairly rich in all three vitamins , and contributing at the same time a considerable amount of ash . Its first cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through the winter when other fresh vegetables are difficult to procure gives it special importance as a source of the C vitamin . The habit of eating it shredded raw is an excellent one for adults . For little children it should be steamed only a few minutes and seasoned // with a little salt and cream or butter . Tiny babies can take the expressed juice when there is no more convenient source of the C vitamin procurable . The ease with which the C vitamin is destroyed by cooking cabbage and the likelihood of irritating substances being developed by long heating make it imperative that domestic customs be improved in respect to cooking this vegetable in order that it may hold its rightful place in the economical dietary . To be rich in the A vitamin its leaves must be really green , not white . The same is true of lettuce , celery , and the like . The carrot , though neither green nor leafy , must also be reckoned one of the cheap sources of vitamins . It contains a good supply of the A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of the C vitamin , depending upon how long it has been stored and how young it was when taken from the garden . All summer young and tender carrots may add materially to the C vitamin content of little children 's diets , and in the winter the older carrots , especially when creamed , are valuable for calories and ash constituents as well as the A and B vitamins . No catalogue of cheap vegetable sources of vitamins would be complete without the white potato . While it does not contain much vitamin A it is rich in B and C in addition to its calories , protein , and iron . It well deserves its place as a dietary staple . The only danger is , that contributing so much , its shortcomings will not be realized , and it will be used to the exclusion of vegetables which yield the A vitamin and those which are laxative . // The tomato lost its place in the culinary dictionary as a fruit just as it lost its name of love-apple , but it became a most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all three vitamins and like some other fruits in retaining its C vitamin when cooked or canned . This makes it available all the year round at a moderate cost in comparison with fresh vegetables . Each season and each locality will produce vegetables whose nutritive properties should be known , so that they may be used to the best advantage . Beet greens , dandelions , turnip tops , and the like are often available at no added cost , and should be regarded as so much clear profit . Whenever there is a garden there should be lettuce . All summer long it may function in the daily dietary , sometimes by itself , often an accompaniment to more highly flavored fruits or vegetables , but always to be eaten and not left on the plate for " manners , " which only ' reveals one 's ignorance of the real rules of eating . In larger towns and cities lettuce is available practically all the year , but in the winter it commands a high price and the housewife may well content herself with cabbage and tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that green lettuce is to be given preference over white . Canned vegetables have to be studied individually . As already stated , the tomato serves its nutritive purpose about as well canned as fresh . But that is not true of all vegetables . The greatest loss is of the C vitamin . The A and B vitamins stand processing better , but there is likelihood of some loss . Hence when fresh // vegetables are as cheap as canned they should be given preference and reliance should not be placed exclusively on canned ones ( except tomatoes ) until we know more about the changes which processing brings . Dried vegetables are the cheapest of all so far as first cost is concerned , but here again we must know what has happened to the vitamins in the drying process . Dried beans and peas are an excellent source of the B vitamin but not of the others . Sprouted beans and peas have been used in emergency for the C vitamin which develops in the process of germination . In the case of leafy vegetables like spinach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature , the better the C vitamin will be preserved . Commercial preparations are dried at a low temperature in a vacuum and may in this way retain for a time their original properties . But aging is also a factor , so that we should not do well to depend entirely upon dried vegetables for our C vitamin . Fresh fruits which can be eaten raw or with very little cooking are particularly valuable for their contribution of the C vitamin , though generally good sources of B also . They are , with a few exceptions such as the orange , unimportant sources of A , and are generally somewhat more expensive than the vegetables which have been mentioned . Apples well deserve their place as a staple fruit almost the year round , and those who can grow them and store them for winter eating raw or freshly cooked , have a good source of the B vitamin and some C vitamin , at // very low cost . Even in city markets the apple is generally an economical fruit . Oranges , being very rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as B ) , are for a considerable part of the year a good investment , though seldom as cheap as canned tomatoes . The practice of serving half an orange is commendable where economy must be practical . Half an orange a day is probably sufficient C vitamin for any one , unless it is the very young child with no other source of this vitamin . Other fresh fruits may he cheap enough to use more or less freely in the height of their season . Dried fruits are not to be regarded as sources of the C vitamin , though they may contribute considerable B. Our knowledge of the vitamin content of fruits which are commonly canned is meager , but we should not expect to depend upon them for the C vitamin . CHAPTER XIV FOOD FOR THE FAMILY GROUP : FOOD PLANS AND DIETARIES A SIMPLE , well-balanced menu provided from day to day for a family group of healthy persons with reasonable appetites ought to go a long ways toward insuring the continuance of health , and we have in experience abundant evidence that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hundreds of laboratory experiments continuing through many generations of animals make it very clear that growth to full stature , freedom from susceptibility to infection , postponement of the signs of senility , and maintenance of youthful vigor depend in large measure upon the continuance of a suitable diet throughout the life history of the individual , his parents , and his grandparents . We should not be blinded to the teachings of such experiments by the fact that the human species grows slowly and has a longer life span than common animals . As soon as we examine human studies extending over even five-year periods ( and five years is as two months in the life of a laboratory rat ) , we may begin to see the workings of the laws of nutrition in the human world . It is only by patience and foresight that we can attain the highest nutritional state . 268 // No housewife will see startling returns from a good dietary program unless her family has been very distinctly below par at the outset . But every housewife may hope to increase year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become vigorous men and women if she can enlist their cooperation in a perpetual " health campaign " in which one objective is always an adequate diet . The suggestions which have been made in the preceding chapters in regard to the special needs of persons of different ages and occupations can be in the main carried out without detailed calculations of quantities consumed or of food values obtained . But , since the fundamental basis of nutrition is in the last analysis a quantitative matter , the housewife has a surer grasp on the situation if she can now and then make a study of the amounts of nutritive material which her group is actually consuming . She will in this way find out whether there is a tendency toward over- or underconsumption , or toward a one-sided diet , and can modify her table accordingly . It is proposed , therefore , in this chapter , to describe a simple way of planning family dietaries and to give some illustrations of what can be done with different sums of money towards securing nourishing fare . Planning a Family Dietary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nutrition , we should have at the outset some idea of the fuel needs of our family group . // Let us take for illustration a family consisting of a professional man , a woman doing all but the heaviest household tasks , a baby one year old , a boy three years old , two girls , six and nine , a boy of eleven , and a grandmother of ninety . From the data in preced-ing chapters we may estimate the requirements of the group as follows ( assuming average body weights ) : Thus we find the total fuel requirement of our group is about 14,000 calories . In the typical family , consist-ing of father , mother , and three children under fifteen , where the man 's occupation is sedentary , the energy requirement usually ranges from 8500 to 12,000 calories per day , depending upon the ages of the children . In a family of the same size , where the father is doing manual labor and often the mother also , or where the // children are over twelve years old , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . The exact fuel intake will fluctuate somewhat from day to day , of course , with minor changes in the degree of activity of different members of the family , so all the housewife need aim to do is to keep the fuel supply fairly constant , without trying to make exact calculations . A little care will prevent a feast of calories one day and a famine the next , and keeping track of body weight will tell whether each is getting his proper share . Essentials in the Family Dietary As a working basis in building up the family dietary , it is a good plan to make first a list of the food materials which need to be included in the day 's rations , no matter what the particular menu . For the group which we are using by way of illustration there should be provided : Milk for all ? one quart apiece if possible for each child and a pint for each adult Fruit juice for the one-year-old At least one kind of fruit for the others Cereal for all the children ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three youngest At least one kind of vegetable besides potatoes for all the others Eggs for at least the three youngest children and some protein-bearing dish ( meat or a meat substitute ) for the rest To this list may be added those staples which are likely to appear in every day 's menu , such as bread and butter , potatoes , and some other kind of vegetable . An estimate can quickly be made of the fuel that will probably be supplied by these items of the diet . // Comparing these figures with the total energy requirement of the family , it will be noted that the milk will furnish over one-fourth ( nearly thirty per cent ) of the total calories , the fruits and vegetables of all kinds taken together about half as many ( fifteen per cent ) and the eggs and meat together about half as many as the last ( eight per cent ) . In other words these items will make up over half the total calories , leaving the rest to be supplied largely by bread , breakfast cereals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a diet is not likely to be deficient in protein , ash constituents , or vitamins unless the fruits and vegetables are restricted to kinds notably deficient in some respect ( as the exclusive use of dried fruits and vegetables which would be likely to result in deficiency of the C vitamin ) . // Planning the Menu Keeping in mind the fact that we are going to include the above in the day 's menu , we may next decide on the dishes which are to be served for some particular day . Usually the dinner will be planned first , as the most formal and substantial meal , and the meat dish taken as the keynote . Suppose , then , we are to have baked fish , as halibut . This gives us a characteristic protein food , but not in a highly flavored form . We may , therefore , have a soup and salad of pronounced flavor , and develop the following menu of simple , wholesome dishes of which most of the family may partake , thus saving the labor of preparing special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table This will serve for the father , the mother , and the two older children as it stands , and for the grandmother with the omission of the egg sauce , salad , and lady fingers , and a serving of the custard part of the apple float for her dessert . Her bread should be toasted or zwieback be used . If this dinner be served at night , the younger children will have a simple supper beforehand ; the baby at 5.30 and the three- and six-year-olds at the same time or just afterwards . It is always an // advantage to serve the young children at a separate table , at least for all but one meal . Usually their meal hours do not coincide with those of the older members of the family , and if they do come to the adult table they need the undivided attention of some one to supervise their eating . If that person is the mother , she does not have a chance to eat her own meal satisfactorily , and often goes undernourished . The children at their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share , and more care can be given to their table manners and conversation , ? a very important part of their education , for eating habits once formed are hard to break , and good ones are a valuable hygienic and social asset for every child . The character of the luncheon will depend largely upon the breakfast and the occupations of the different members of the family . In the city , some are likely to be away from home at midday , and luncheon is a less formal meal than where all gather together at noontime . Having planned the dinner , it is best to decide on the breakfast next . Assuming that a medium-weight breakfast suits this family best , we might have : Table Before this is served , the baby will have had a cup of warm milk at six o'clock , and the three-year-old will have // his breakfast just before the family breakfast ( 7 A.M. ) , or , if the hours for the two coincide , he may take his with the rest ? orange juice , wheatena with top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast the baby will have two or three tablespoons of orange juice ( 8 A.M. ) and at ten o'clock the two youngest children will have their lunch ; a crust of bread to munch , then for the baby thoroughly cooked wheatena with top milk and milk to drink , for the three-year-old a glass of milk and a piece of stale bread or hard cracker . It is to be hoped that the six-year-old will have a glass of milk and a cracker or other suitable food in the middle of the morning at school . Assuming that luncheon will be served for all the family except the youngest , a suitable menu to fit the day 's scheme would be : Table This luncheon will need no modification for the sixyear-old except that she should have day-old graham bread instead of the fresh Boston brown bread . After the family luncheon the baby will have another meal ( 2 P.M. ) , consisting of milk , egg yolk , strained vegetable pulp ( which may be made into soup with part of the milk ) , and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time have a soft-cooked // egg , some toast , some of the strained green vegetable or some of the baked banana served in the regular luncheon , rice pudding , and milk to drink . In the evening , before the family dinner , the three youngest will have their suppers : the baby , milk and cereal jelly , baked potato , and a very little apple sauce ; the three-year-old , cereal and milk , bread and butter , a little of the dessert set aside when preparing the family dinner , and milk to drink ; the six-year-old , cereal and milk , bread and butter , apple snow , lady fingers , and milk to drink . It would be an easy matter to arrange for baked potatoes for the children 's suppers , since potatoes on the half shell form part of the family dinner , but in this case let us assume that the rice ( used also for the three-year-old 's pudding ) is a left-over from the day before . Late in the evening ( io P.M. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as hot milk , plain or flavored ) and a cracker ; but this entails little work by way of preparation . It is possible , therefore , by choosing simple , easily digested foods for the general menu ( which are good for everybody ) , to provide for the special needs of the children without much extra cooking , even if meals must be served at a good many hours during the day . Calculation of the Family Dietary Having now estimated the quantitative needs of our family for protein and fuel , and planned a menu designed to give everybody something suitable to eat , our next // aim is to find out how nearly this will fulfill the theoretical requirements . We must make a list of the amounts to be served and then , by reference to the tables in the Appendix , especially those of ioo-calorie portions ( Table I ) , and those giving food values in terms of common measures ( Table II ) , we can very quickly estimate fuel values for the day . The dietary is given in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's requirements , we find that we have slightly exceeded our quota of fuel , and have a very liberal supply of protein , much of which is from milk , so that we know it will satisfy the protein needs of the growing children in the best possible way . The adults will get their protein largely from the halibut , chicken , and eggs , supplemented by milk , cereals , and bread . We have used a little over six quarts of milk , 60o calories of cereal in the form of wheatena and some rice ; five eggs and one yolk in addition to those in the egg sauce , apple snow , custard , and lady fingers ; about 500 calories in the form of fruit exclusive of the bananas , which in this dietary may be regarded as a substitute for the root or other vegetable in our original plan ; about 275 in green vegetables ( string beans , tomatoes , lettuce , pea pulp ) ; about 1700 in bread , over 200o as butter , and about goo as halibut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because toast with the creamed chicken took the place of potato in the luncheon and the children had cereal for supper , whereas frequently they might have baked potatoes . // The important sources of vitamins in the diet are shown in the following table . This table is convincing evidence of the abundance of all three vitamins in this diet . Checking up on the ash constituents , we shall find that our requirement of about 7 grams of calcium per day for the family is met by the milk alone , while the eggs , Boston brown bread , oranges , and string beans furnish a gram and a quarter more . A phosphorus allowance of 6 grams is also met by the milk , and fully as much more is furnished by the rest of the diet . // There is not so much leeway on the iron , but an allow-ance adequate for the family , 0.07 gram per day , is covered by the small contributions of many foods , as the following estimate will show . Thus , by following a simple general plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arranging an at-tractive menu , we can get a good family dietary without great difficulty , if we do not have to count cost too closely . // Cost of the Family Dietary The dietary just planned will probably cost from $2.8o ? $3.5o per day , or from two to two and one-half cents per zoo calories , depending upon the locality , provided milk costs fifteen cents per quart and eggs three to four cents apiece . With milk at ten cents per quart and eggs not over two and one-half cents apiece , fruit and vegetables correspondingly cheap , it would be possible to . purchase such food for slightly under two cents per zoo calories . It must be remembered that in these estimates nothing is allowed for kitchen or table waste , beyond the unavoidable losses in paring vegetables , discarding meat bones , etc . If the cook spoils food in the kitchen , or leaves it in the cooking utensils through careless heating or bad scraping ; if she is not careful to save every bit of edible food which comes back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the family has no more to eat . Scientifically speaking , bread crumbs have the same food value as freshly cut slices of bread , bits of meat on bones are as nutritious as handsome roasts , sour milk as valuable as sweet . Every calorie thrown away either deprives the family of nutriment which it needs or adds to the total cost of its food supply . At the table there is often much carelessness about leaving food on individual plates , breaking bread or rolls and eating only a small portion , and otherwise performing a kind of " dog in the manger " act , refusing to eat and spoiling the food for others . Careful supervision of the serving will help to prevent this , and // children should be early trained to a sense of responsi bility about the waste of food . In public places , where strangers are fed , it is not possible to gauge accurately their probable consumption and serve accordingly ; con sequently the table waste is often great , but at the home table , where individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for table waste . A food budget of $2.85 per day means $t000 a year for this item of family expenditure alone . To justify such an outlay , an income of at least three times this amount would be required , if the family is to have cloth ing and shelter at all commensurate in quality with the food , and opportunity to satisfy its " higher " or intel lectual and spiritual needs , such as education for the children , books , travel , music , entertainments , gifts to church and charity , and other good things which require money . ' Reducing the Cost of the Dietary The majority of families do not have incomes of $3000 or more a year ; most housewives must spend less than two cents per too calories on their food in order to have money for decent clothing and shelter and any " higher life " at all . Yet these families have need of being well nourished and wish to enjoy some of the esthetic pleasure of a well-set table . Suppose , for inFOOD // stance , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about one and three-fourths cents per too calories , making a total cost of about $2.50 per day . In our first dietary we have used a liberal supply of fresh fruit and vegetables , and as these are expensive items when considered as sources of fuel , we shall be obliged to cut down the amount somewhat , using only one kind of fresh fruit and one fresh vegetable in a single day , or we may substitute canned or dried fruit for some of the fresh . While the milk seems to occupy a large place , its value and economy have already been demonstrated , and as long as the average cost of the dietary is over one and one-half cents per too calories it can be used freely to advantage . Eggs are usually expensive , and can be omitted for breakfast , in the sauce for the fish , and the dessert , and cookies substituted for the lady fingers . Chicken is an expensive form of meat and while not much is used , the cost could be lowered by substituting dried beef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the dinner is usually not very dear and may be retained . The consomme adds little food value and , unless made of material not valuable for other purposes , can be omitted . Keeping in mind the general program first proposed for this dietary ( see page 271 ) , we may plan a second menu at lower cost . ' // MENU I BREAKFAST : Oranges ( very large ) Wheatena with cream ( top milk ) Puffy omelet with bacon Toast Coffee for adults Milk for children LUNCHEON : Creamed chicken on toast Baked bananas Boston brown bread Rice pudding Tea for adults Milk for children DINNER : Consomme Baked halibut , egg sauce Potatoes on the half shell String beans , buttered Bread and butter Tomato salad , Trench dressing Apple snow with boiled custard Lady fingers MENU II BREAKFAST : Oranges ( smaller ) Wheatena with cream ( top milk ) Toast Coffee for adults Milk for children LUNCHEON : Creamed dried beef on toast Baked bananas Boston brown bread Rice Pudding Tea for adults Milk for children DINNER : Baked halibut , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bread and butter Cole slaw Chocolate blancmange with thin cream and sugar Plain cookies That the second menu will answer the food requirements of the family quite as well as the first is shown by the following calculations . The calculation of the calories makes it evident that the changes in the menu have not materially affected the fuel value or protein values of the diet . The vitamin content , too , is little altered , for although the tomatoes , apple , and lettuce are omitted , cabbage has taken their place to some extent , and nearly a quart of milk has been // // // added . We are even better off as regards calcium and phosphorus on account of the extra milk . The iron is slightly lower , and the difference might well be made up by the use of whole wheat bread , as is always desirable in economical dietaries . It may seem surprising that the protein remains high in spite of the fact that seven eggs used in the first dietary // have been left out of the second . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creamed dried beef yields more protein than the creamed chicken . The changes suggested in the fruit and vegetables may not always mean much saving ; all depends upon season and locality and general market conditions . But cabbage is usually one of the cheapest vegetables , while fresh tomatoes are often rather dear ; fine , large oranges are always more expensive than medium-sized ones , and the reduction in the number of fruits used in the dietary , by the omission of the apples , is also in the nature of an economy , since fruits are always relatively expensive if one has to buy them in the market . The chocolate blancmange served with top milk gives nearly twice the fuel value of the apple snow and boiled custard , but costs less than one and one-half cents per roo calories , while the other dessert will cost at least two cents per zoo calories . If these modifications of the first menu do not mean the most effective cost reduction under all circumstances , they will at least show how one may go about the reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan has been thought out . Dietaries costing two to two and one-half cents per ioo calories are comparatively easy to plan ; milk may be used freely , and a variety of fruits and vegetables can be obtained , fresh or canned , with dried ones occasionally for variety . Meats of choice cuts can be provided in moderation , the more expensive kinds being offset by the introduction of a meat substitute or some specially cheap cut now and then . Dietaries costing // from one and three-fourths to two cents per too calories must be given more thought in order to keep them well balanced . Milk becomes a more important item , taking the place , to some extent , of other protein , vitamin , and ash-bearing foods , especially expensive meats and fresh fruits and vegetables . Eggs must be used very little , except for the young children , and butter confined chiefly to table use and those dishes in which its flavor really counts . In others , cheaper forms of fat may be substituted . Dietaries Costing Less than One and Three-Fourths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of food to one and three-fourths cents per too calories , distinct emphasis will have to be placed on the non-perishable , staple foods , such as cereals and dried fruits and vegetables , which in the main cost from three-fourths of a cent to one and one-half cents per too calories , and very careful selection will have to be made of meats and fresh or canned fruits and vegetables . In the family group under consideration , the children require over half the total fuel proposed as a standard . Their food , as already pointed out in the chapters especially devoted to their requirements , can not be provided as cheaply as that for healthy adults , because of their greater need of the relatively expensive growth-promoting materials ? proteins , ash , and vitamins . When the cost of food is as high as it is in New York City , it is difficult to provide an ideal dietary for children for less than one and three292 FEEDING THE FAMILY fourths cents per zoo calories . Milk at fifteen cents per quart can no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day per child can be provided as long as the average cost of the dietary is not under one and threequarters cents per Too calories . Sometimes economy can be effected by buying two grades of milk , the better reserved for the little children and for table use , the less expensive used in cookery . Condensed milk may also be used in cookery or for the adults , and this is usually cheaper than fresh milk at fifteen cents a quart . When the dietary costs less than one and three-quarters cents per Too calories , a quart of milk per day can be furnished only to the children under seven or eight years of age , and not more than a pint for each of the others . Cheap substitutes for the rest of the milk are soups made from dried beans , peas , lentils , or peanut butter for young children , and these legumes cooked in other ways for older children and adults . Cereals from whole grains can also be used to advantage to supplement the milk . The purchase of butter is seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three-fourths cents per Too calories . Oleomargarine is equally valuable as fuel , and when fresh is sweet and clean and good ? much better than inferior butter , which lacks the fine texture and flavor which we pay for in high-priced butter . Still cheaper fats than oleomargarine can be used in cookery , such as the lard substitutes made from cottonseed oil , suet , carefully tried-out beef fat , and salt fat pork . Cottonseed oil is equal as fuel to olive oil and costs much less . It must always be borne in mind , however , that // these fats contain little or none of the A vitamin , and their use instead of butter is only permissible when this vita-min is supplied in other foods , principally milk with its full content of butter fat . Dried fruits and vegetables must be to a considerable degree substituted for fresh . Bananas are usually cheap , and at certain seasons so are apples and oranges . Other fresh fruits must be purchased with care and only when their cost is at its very lowest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in fuel value , low in price , and easy to prepare . They are often cheapest when at their best , i.e. , when the skins have darkened and the fruit is soft , though still firm . Digestive diffi-culties usually arise from eating them too green or too fast . They should be eaten only when all traces of green have disappeared , even at the ends . Baking ripe bananas in the skin , if properly done , produces a more suc-culent food of fine flavor . They must be quickly baked till soft and the juice begins to flow , but no longer , or the juice all oozes out and they become tough and dark and lose much of their flavor . Bananas baked before the skins darken will never be as palatable as the fully ripened ones , though they are more digestible than if eaten raw . Unripe bananas are best baked without the skins and basted with a syrup . These may be used as a dessert , while those baked in the skins may take the place of a vegetable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little water , flavored with lemon juice and sugar , making a palatable sauce . Un-fortunately their vitamin content is low , so that they // must not be used to the exclusion of such a fruit as the orange , which has more of all three vitamins . The many and varied uses of apples , which resemble bananas in their vitamin content , are too well known to require comment . It is upon the dried fruits , however , that emphasis is to be placed in economical dietaries . Dates , raisins , prunes , peaches , figs , apricots , and apples may usually be obtained for less than two cents per ioo calories ( raisins for less than one cent ) , and their uses are many and varied . Dates , figs , raisins , and apples will make bread crumbs or flour and cheap fat acceptable in the form of steamed puddings or plain cake . Raisins make a good sauce when stewed tender in a little water ; their own store of sugar will make it sufficiently sweet . These stewed raisins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change from milk . Dates may also be cooked soft in a little water , then put through a coarse sieve , making a palatable marmalade without added sugar . The addition of a little sugar and lemon juice will make a richer sauce , however : Dates make an excellent filling for sandwiches ; or chopped dates , figs , and raisins may be combined . Dates may be served with breakfast cereals , being especially good with wheat preparations . Raisin or date bread will be appreciated by children . The fruit , cut in small pieces , is added to the dough when kneading for the pan . The dried fruits are not to be depended upon for the C vitamin , which disappears more or less completely in the drying process . But since they add so much to the diet in other ways ? fuel , ash constituents , laxative properties , palatFOOD // ability ? their use should be encouraged and their defi ciencies made up by other foods , ? tomatoes , for example . Stewed figs , served in their own juice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prunes are often badly cooked and not as highly esteemed as they might be . Long , slow cooking in plenty of water to cover them well is necessary to make them soft and juicy , no sugar being added during the process . When done , they should be moderately sweetened and allowed to stand at least twenty-four hours before serving . They will then be plump and well seasoned to the center . Prunes of the cheapest grades are often little but skin and stone , and even careful cooking will not make them attractive . Hence it pays to buy prunes of good quality . The addi tion of a few slices of lemon while cooking gives a pleasant change of flavor . Prunes keep well , and there are many uses for them . Prune whip or prune souffle , made of sifted prune pulp and whites of eggs , is an attractive and wholesome dessert . The juice may be stiffened with gelatin and served as prune jelly . Prunes and brown bread may be baked with milk and eggs like a plain bread pudding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a filling of prune pulp thickened with a little cornstarch . Variety can be given to the menu by com binations of the more inexpensive fruits . Dried peaches stewed with raisins , prunes stewed with apricots , dates baked with dried apples in a pie , are all attractive combinations . Besides the dried legumes ( peas , beans , lentils ) , the cheapest vegetables are usually potatoes , cabbage , // onions , carrots , turnips , and parsnips . While tomatoes are somewhat more expensive , they have great value as a source of vitamins and especially of the C vitamin which is most likely to be deficient as the dried and root vegetables have to be depended on more and more . Aside from requirements for certain dietary essentials we relish a diet of pronounced and varied flavor ; bread , cereals , beans , potatoes , and the like are too bland to be wholly satisfying . The secret of making a palatable dietary at a low cost is to develop the characteristic flavor of the mild foods as far as possible ( usually by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's ration some of the highly flavored foods . Tea and coffee are desirable for flavor , but they may satisfy the palate when the diet is wholly inadequate . They are a real menace to good nutrition in children . Wisely used , they may be helpful in the adult dietary . Meat is too expensive a source of protein to be depended upon for this foodstuff . It is to be regarded rather as a source of flavor and of fat . A little salt pork , bacon , or ham will cause a large dish of baked beans to be relished ; creamed salt fish or dried beef will make bread ( toast ) or potatoes more acceptable ; a small portion of beef or mutton will give character to a stew of vegetables and dumplings , or to the pastry and gravy which yield most of the fuel in a meat pie . Aside from the milk , the best sources of protein will be the legumes , including peanuts , especially in the form of peanut butter , and the less expensive kinds of cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans and bean soup , many attractive dishes can be made from the sifted pulp of well-cooked beans of different kinds . It may be molded around a center of seasoned bread crumbs and baked in a loaf to be served with a brown or tomato sauce ; or , again , a casserole may be lined with bean pulp , the center filled with corned beef hash , a cover of pulp laid over it , and the dish baked and served with a sauce . Lentils cooked and ground in a food chopper may be made into an excellent loaf with chopped peanuts or chopped beef . Cheese is valuable for its flavor as well as its food value . The United States Department of Agriculture has published a bulletin giving many recipes for this useful and economical food . ' It will give flavor to such bland foods as rice , macaroni , bread , and hominy in a variety of ways , not fully appreciated by many housewives . It can be successfully combined with lentils , nuts , potatoes , or tomatoes , adding to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of preparing these foods . Family Dietaries at the Lowest Cost If we try to plan a dietary for our family requiring about 14,000 calories at a cost of less than one and onehalf cents per loo calories , we shall find that we can not afford much more than five quarts of milk if we have to pay ten or more cents per quart for it ; this will give a quart apiece for each of the three younger children , a // pint apiece for each of the older ones , and a pint for the adults . By using butter less freely than in the other dietaries , we may be able to provide it here , but to reduce the cost to less than one and three-quarters cents per ioo calories it will be necessary to pay no more than 25 cents per pound ? the usual city cost of oleomargarine , which may be substituted for all the butter . To compensate for the reduction in the amount of butter , some increase in the amount of bread , breakfast cereal , and sugar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the little children , and bananas substituted for oranges for the rest . Cereal coffee to which an equal volume of hot milk is added will give the older children a wholesome beverage , and a cup of this may be more satisfying , though not more nutritious , than a half cup of milk would be . Eggs can not be used every day , even for the young children , when the cost of the dietary must be less than one and one-half cents per zoo calories . Therefore a mice pudding with milk and raisins but no eggs has been chosen and oatmeal cookies , which are very high in nutritive value , take the place of the expensive lady fingers . A meat substitute for luncheon ? macaroni and cheese ? instead of creamed dried beef , and the use of salt fish for dinner instead of fresh will effect further economy . A rearrangement of Menu II , following these ideas , is given on next page . // Table Worked out in detail for the family , as shown below , this menu fulfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more expensive ones . Some changes in the little children 's meals will be noted , as well as those for the older children and adults , such as the use of some of the macaroni without the cheese for the three-year-old 's dinner , split pea instead of green pea puree , and apple sauce for apricots .
