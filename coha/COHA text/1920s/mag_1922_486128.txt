W ITH the war four years behind us we are still witnessing efforts to poison the public opinion of America comparable to those by which the Allies " sold " their side of the war to our fellow-countrymen and the Germans vainly endeavored to do so . The news-propagandist did not lay down his arms with the Germans . He has become habituated to their use and he picks them up whenever opportunity offers . The recent events in Turkey have given him every opportunity and  --  presto , it is our old friends , our blood-brothers , the English , whom we first find at work again . General Harington , acting apparently also for his Allied associates , clamped the lid on in Constantinople . Such news as has been coming out of there has been censored at the source and colored , of course , entirely in the interest of the censors . If anybody is so gullible as to think that anything which has come out of Constantinople in any way does justice to Kemal Pasha , to the Turks , or to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true in Turkey is true elsewhere . A correspondent of the New York World , Mr. F. P. Glass , Jr. , who has just returned from India and Egypt , declares that the outside world was not allowed to hear what happened at the recent proclamation of the Sultan at Cairo : " Not a line appeared in the American press on the riots and the strict police control that attended the coronation of the Sultan as King of Egypt . The city of Cairo was under martial law and the censorship was complete . It permitted the world to know that the King had been crowned  --  just that and no more , and no more could be sent . " Mr. Glass wrote various letters upon his observations in Egypt , including a report of the killing of seventeen men out of an army of 7,000 who attempted to storm the Sultan 's palace . None of these letters got through to New York ; neither did one written from India about the political conditions there . They were " lost in the mails , " although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinations . Mr. Glass was comforted by the fact that he had copies of the lost communications . But , curiously enough , whether by mischance or for some other reason , those copies disappeared from his trunk which spent some unexplained time in the hands of French custom officials . Obviously it is hardly the fault of the mails that our American newspapers are suddenly without news of India  --  although , as Mr. Glass says , " things are boiling " there ; a biased censorship is chronic in India . The same issue of the Editor and Publisher which records Mr. Glass 's experiences contains also a graphic account of the severe censorship imposed in Athens during the Greek revolution . There , too , the effort was always a deliberate attempt to control the character of the news ; everything had to be written from the Government 's viewpoint . It was , for instance , not permissible to herald the coming of the revolution until insurgents actually captured the censor . The spirit in which this is done is evidenced by the attitude of the dictator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , unless they cease to print unfavorable news items about the Fascisti , they will be suppressed  --  this after he has terrorized the Socialist press into silence . How can foreigners hope to form an accurate opinion of Mussolini 's achievements when his critics in the Chamber and in the press are muzzled ? Even more interesting is the reappearance here of the foreign propagandist . We confess that we have no objection whatsoever to the trip of M. Clemenceau because he has been open and above-board and quite frank in his efforts . But others do not share our tolerance . Thus , a Republican politician of national prominence writes us : " Are n't Clemenceau 's performances ' the limit ' ? If any American were to go to France and talk to the French as he talks to us , he would be asked to leave the country forthwith  --  indeed he would be lucky if he escaped physical violence . " Clemenceau , it seems to us , has had his proper day in court  --  and failed . More dangerous , because more sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst offenders against this country , Sir Gilbert Parker . We can not resist recalling his own words ( Harper 's Magazine , March , 1918 ) as to how the British propaganda to put us into the war worked : I need hardly say that the scope of our propaganda department in America was very extensive and its activity very wide . We furnished a weekly report to the British Cabinet ; we kept in constant touch with the permanent correspondents of American newspapers in England ; we arranged interviews for these correspondents with prominent Englishmen , and we furnished each newspaper in America with an English newspaper ; we influenced the man in the street through the moving-picture shows , articles , and pamphlets ; replied to letters of American critics . We advised and stimulated many persons to write articles ; we used ' the friendly services and assistance of confidential American friends . We established associations for propaganda by personal correspondence with influential people in every profession , beginning with university and college presidents , professors , and scientific men , running through all ranges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. , libraries , clubs , and newspapers . We had ten thousand propagandists in America . We notice that some members of the American Legion are protesting against the alleged German propaganda to be spread here by the executive officer of the Emden , von Muecke . We commend to them the activities of Sir Gilbert Parker and certain British free-lance writers in New York , whose return to England would be welcome . The only encouraging thing about this propaganda from all sides  --  notably the anti-Turk campaign which fills our papers  --  is that in Washington some of our elder statesmen are at last on their guard . Significant , too , is an utterance from the Editor and Publisher , a paper which did its share during the war in deceiving the American people . It declares that " war fires are again smoldering at the foundations of Europe 's civilization , " and that American newspapers are telling the truth where they can , but it affirms that " they can not present , interpret , or amplify news that is slain in its cradle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " welter of intrigue and secret machinations for national gain that is keeping Europe and its possessions in unending upheaval " so that America can " upset the stupid plans of greedy self-seeking chancelleries of an Old World that seems more senile every day . " What that calls for is simply that our papers shall make it their business to question the sources of their news and to adopt the policy of determining to tell the truth . That they have not done as yet . Let us hope that the conversion of the Editor and Publisher means that the profession for which it speaks is at last determined to protect the American public from the avalanche of lies and propaganda which is again descending upon it . OW A National Theater N ATIONAL institutes of the arts , academies , theaters ? these things are among the handsomest dreams of those whose reputation is founded , whose position is secure , whose desires are now limited to enshrining and perpetuating in brass and marble both what they are and represent . Their mistake is human and pardonable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drama , the wisdom itself that must be aere perennius . Walls will not keep out the " eating rain , " nor render the North wind powerless . The spirit is unimprisonable . Academies may resist solecisms of speech and collaborate on dictionaries . They are bound to be the sworn foes of creation which must involve change . There can be no change that does not , in a measure , negate or revise or reinterpret that which has been and is . But the academicians are always the possessors . And all possessors echo the cry of Wagner 's dragon : " I lie here possessing ; let me sleep ! " Hence it is useless to rehearse the roll of great Frenchmen who were not members of the Academy or the story of how Hauptmann did not get the Schiller prize . This situation is the same everywhere and always . It belongs to the nature of things . Now , for the second time , we are to have a National Theater . Mr. Augustus Thomas and the Producing Managers ' Association have let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hold up a lofty standard " ; it is to stimulate the study of the drama " in our universities , our colleges , and our schools " ; it is to " organize subsidiary associated groups . " These are terrible plans and terrible words . What is a " lofty standard " ? Beauty , truth , creative vision ? They can not be standardized . The elders of each generation standardize them in their minds , to be sure . And in the names of these standards they deny Moliere Christian burial , hail Flaubert to court , denounce Ibsen as a filthy ape , Shaw as a blasphemous jester , Hauptmann as a dangerous revolutionary . So the " lofty standard " will be , as it has always been , the standard of the harmless , polite , agreeable . This standard will , of course , meet with no resistance in our " universities , our colleges , and our schools , " since these are already committed to it . We have a perfect vision of advanced classes and proseminars pursuing with anemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater : " The Shakespearean Interpretations of Mr. Walter Hampden " ; " Why Playwrights Must Be Popular , " by Professor Brander Matthews ; " Keep the Drama Sweet , " by Professor William Lyon Phelps ; and " A National Drama is a Patriotic Drama , " by Nicholas Murray Butler , Samuel Harden Church , and James W. Gerard . Yes , as the heroes say in the last act of sentimental comedies of intrigue , we see it all ; we see it as though it had already happened . All the gentlemen whose names we have mentioned are on the aboard of incorporators and directors of the new National Theater . In addition there are George Pierce Baker , David Belasco , Owen Davis , John Drew , William Gillette , Otto H. Kahn , Channing Pollock , Arthur Hobson Quinn , Franklin Haven Sargent , Otis Skinner , Booth Tarkington , Whitney Warren . Very well . But we have a creative theater in America and the beginnings of a creative drama , and where are the representatives of these forces ? Where are Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are Robert Edmond Jones or Lee Simonson or Norman Bel Geddes ? Where are Robert Milton or Philip Moeller or Frank Reicher ? Where are John Barrymore or Grace George or even Jacob Ben Ami ? Where , in brief , are the playwrights , scenic artists , directors , actors that represent the hope and the creative vigor of our stage ? Once before we were to have a National Theater . The splendid Century Theater was built , and Mr. Winthrop Ames , an able man and an idealist , was put in charge . Whether it was because of his own limitations or because of the deference he owed the directorate , the fact remains that the venture perished of its own refinement , bloodlessness , propriety , lack of creative vision , and vigor . Nice things were done nicely . No doubt the directors of those days shudder at the uses to which the Century has since been put . But these musical comedies and spectacles and Russian variety shows have in them the principle of life . And only what is alive , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibilities is fruitful . All else is sterile  --  good taste , polite intentions , philanthropic attitudes , noble traditions . Without life these things do not count . That is what the academicians can never understand ; that is why , robed in dignity and fame and security , the gibe of small poets survives their pomp and circumstance and the little French wit has the last word over the dignitaries of his day : Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien , Pas meme acad  --  micien . The Growing Tax Burden c HAT do I care ? I do n't pay taxes . " This , as a W retort to those who give warning of increasing burdens , was commoner ten years ago than it is today . One service that the war did was to prove to people generally that they all pay taxes ; that the direct charges which are placed on the few are promptly distributed to the entire community in the form of increases in the cost of food , housing , fuel , and other universal needs . For this reason the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that it shows a decrease in estimated expenditure from $3,703,801,671 the year before to $3,180,843,234 for the year ending June 30 , 1924 . That is at least a move in the right direction , but Mr. Harding is astray when he suggests that further reduction , if obtained at all , must be made by curtailing the scientific and social services of the Federal government . On the contrary , it should be made by putting the ax to army and navy expenditures and by better measures to prevent fraud and waste in administration . By such means only can we arrest the growing tax burden in the United States . For the tax burden is growing . In spite of the fact that the war ended four years ago our taxes have increased in actual value since 1919 . The National Industrial Conference Board has recently made a computation which shows that in 1919 Federal taxes amounted to $4,926,000,000 . In 1921 they totaled $4,430,000,000 . Superficially this appears to be a reduction of 10 per cent , but the Conference Board has taken the trouble to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is the true method of estimating their burden . The 1921 dollar had a purchasing power of 26 per cent more than the 1919 dollar ; thus the Federal tax burden of the latter year was actually 13 per cent higher than just after the armistice when the country was still staggering under the expense of the vast machine that had been created to fight the Germans . It seems inexcusable , almost inconceivable , that this should be true , and the fact ought to be written big and black upon our political sky as a warning to those who would go on still further tapping the pockets of the public for huge sums with which to pay ship subsidies or a soldiers ' bonus , or who demand larger instead of smaller military expenditures . Stated in terms of its proportion to the national income the tax bill of recent years is equally impressive and disturbing . For the fiscal year 1913-1914 taxes paid to Federal , State , and local governments in the United States represented 6.4 per cent of the national income . By 1919-1920 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 1920-1921 it had mounted to 14.3 per cent . For the calendar year 1921 one-sixth of the current national income was diverted into tax channels for the support of governmental bodies in the United States . It is not merely Federal taxes that have been growing . State and municipal taxation has also been spreading upward and outward with hothouse rapidity . In forty-one States investigated by the National Industrial Conference Board it was found that there had been a gain in this latter kind of taxes of 82 per cent in 1919 over the levies of the year 1912 . In 1920 the increase over the preceding year was 21 per cent , and in 1921 there was a still further jump of 12 per cent . Taking Federal , State , and local taxes as a whole , the per capita burden in 1919 was heaviest in New York , amounting to $148.38 , or 17 per cent of the income . Next in order came Massachusetts ( $125.35 ) , Delaware ( $124.41 ) , Rhode Island ( $115.25 ) , and Michigan ( $105.71 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax . In sixteen States , in 1919 , State and local taxation exceeded the Federal levy . Ever since our great wave of material prosperity during the war we have flattered ourselves that as the richest nation in the world we could spend anything without feeling it . We have talked airily not only of millions but of billions , and nobody has got anywhere in political life on a platform of economy . Owing to huge war profits , and the fact that the country 's business is only now beginning to establish itself on a more normal basis , the tremendous increase in taxes has not been severely felt so far , but acute students of industrial affairs realize that our national tax bill ? Federal , State , and municipal  --  is now making inroads on the surplus necessary for economic progress and constitutes a danger to future growth . When one-sixth of the national income goes into taxes  --  as it did for the calendar year 1921 ? it is time to scrutinize our accounts . Nor is this all that is going into government expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only direct taxation ? . the country is paying an enormous bill in indirect taxation , largely through the operation of the customs tariff , now heavier in the burden that it imposes upon the consuming public than it has been . All this would not matter so much if we were getting something to show for it in the way of efficient governmental administration or far-reaching public improvements . But we are not . Easy come , easy go , is the inevitable process , and millions are absorbed in actual frauds or inexcusable waste , while millions more are dissipated in naval and military expenditures that menace our national peace . It is time for taxpayers  --  that is , for everybody  --  to sit up and take notice . Cooks as Diplomats couple of billions good-will . And we think tremendous things might be accomplished by attention to individual members of Congress . Take , for instance , the persuasive and mellowing powers that lie in a savory chdteaubriant aux pommes paillees . There was for many years in Paris a restaurant that exhibited as its street sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aux pommes paillees at its board . We have always thought that Thackeray 's genius as a writer derived from that diet , and we suspect that if similar fare were smuggled to the table of Senator Borah for a fortnight we should see him introducing a resolution calling for an offensive and defensive alliance with France on any terms that she might choose to name . But the substitution of cooks for politicians as ambassadors should not be limited to France . It would give her too great an advantage . America , too , should make the change , for she has cooks of great subtlety , capable of winning far more affection and esteem for her abroad than she enjoys now . We would nominate for Paris an old-fashioned Negro mammy from Virginia who would regale French officialdom with fried chicken and corn bread until it worshiped even the oceans that wash our shores . To the Court of St. James 's we would send a capable New England grandmother , and we 'll bet our top-hat that after she had breezed into Buckingham Palace once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dozen doughnuts , and a mold of elderberry jelly , there would be no more disagreements with England . In fact , were all our diplomacy to be conducted by cooks , we feel that in six months the whole world would be eating out of our hand , gastronomically and politically  --  and calling for more . ? Henry Ford Goes Bargain Hunting T HE inquiring layman has a rough-and-ready way of deciding a difficult question by finding out how those whom he trusts or distrusts line up on it . That simple rule will bring him little comfort in the interesting case of Henry Ford 's offer for Muscle Shoals . Men like Senators Ladd and Norris are on opposite sides . The Federation of Farm Bureaus and the Federation of Labor favor the offer ; the Farmers ' National Council opposes it . Selfish real-estate interests are said to be lobbying for it and " the greedy vampire , the fertilizer trust , " against it . The tired citizen will have to go to the trouble of making up his own mind . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the development of hydro-electric power from the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals in Alabama , which , supplemented by power derived from the Gorgas steam plant near coal mines over eighty miles away , was to be used in the production of nitrates for explosives . At the close of the war the Government found itself in the possession of the steam plant , the Waco quarry , two nitrate plants , over 4,000 acres of land on which two towns were built , and much valuable equipment in addition to detailed plans for two dams , one of which ( dam Number 2 , or the Wilson dam ) was well under way . Mr. Ford proposes to form a corporation to develop this property on the following terms : ( 1 ) It will purchase the two nitrate plants , the Waco quarry , and the Gorgas steam plant together with all equipment for $5,000,000 payable in annual instalments of $1,000,000 each . The total cost of this property to the taxpayers , exclusive of interest , has been $85,343,296. ( 2 ) It will lease the dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government specifications at the Government 's expense at an estimated cost of about $50,000,000 . At the end of the six-year period estimated as necessary to complete the dams the corporation will pay the Government a rental equal to 4 per cent on the cost of their completion , but it will pay nothing at all on the $17,000,000 already expended on dam Number 2 . During the period of building Mr. Ford fixes an aggregate rental over $10,000,000 less than the Government will probably have to pay in interest charges on the new money it must invest . 3 ) It will pay $55,000 annually for maintenance and repairs to the dams . No provision at all is made for emergency losses due to great floods or other causes . According to much engineering testimony , this amount would prove inadequate even for ordinary upkeep . ( 4 ) It will create a sinking fund to meet the $50,000,000 required to complete the dams by paying the Government annually $46,726 which if prudently invested at 4 per cent will at compound interest amount to $49,071,935 at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant Number 2 in such condition that it , together with its equipment and personnel , may instantly be taken over by the Government in case of war at " a reasonable compensation " to the company . ( 6 ) It will manufacture fertilizer " which shall have the nitrogen content of at least 40,000 tons of fixed nitrogen " annually . On this fertilizer the corporation is to make not more than 8 per cent profit , and a board upon which various farm organizations are to be represented is authorized to inspect its books to enforce this restriction on profit . ( Whether it will be obligated to manufacture fertilizer if it can not do it at a profit is a matter of dispute . ) It is to be exempt from the ordinary restrictions of the Federal Water Power Act , which among other things limits the life of all leases to fifty years  --  half the length of the lease Mr. Ford seeks . Any industrial development will give to the land Mr. Ford thus acquires and to adjoining land already controlled by real-estate speculators an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay nothing . Obviously it is not the financial provisions of this offer which have won it its support . They are ludicrously inadequate . The Alabama Power Company , which has a disputed first right to buy the Gorgas plant in case of its sale , ' has offered $2,500,000 and would probably pay $3,000,000 for it alone  --  half of what Mr. Ford offers for property which cost the Government $85,000,000 ! Mr. Ford himself would probably say that part of the Government 's loss will he due to its failure to follow his advice and issue paper money instead of interest-bearing bonds to cover the cost of completing the dams . Doubtless his celebrated interview on that subject has disarmed some popular criticism of the bargain he seeks to drive . In Congress , however , the defense of Mr. Ford 's financial terms has been confined to the great cost to the Government of letting its investment stand idle , to the risk assumed by Mr. Ford in developing the process of nitrogen fixation , and to the failure of any other corporation to make a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-earned faith in Mr. Ford 's ability and desire to give the farmer cheap fertilizer . Senator Norris has introduced an interesting alternative plan for the development of the whole enterprise under the Federal Chemical Corporation , an agency to be created and controlled by the Government . The corporation would be empowered to keep one plant in shape to manufacture nitrates for explosives in case of war and meanwhile to make and market fertilizer and to sell surplus electrical power to private concerns . The bill provides for the sale of the Gorgas steam plant to the Alabama Water Power Company and for developing storage dams on the Tennessee . Against this bill is the usual fear of the dangers of political interference and governmental incompetence . That fear is not groundless but we suspect some critics of opposing the plan , not because they fear its failing , but because they dread its success and the precedent it would set in the development of water power for the public advantage rather than for the private profit of one favored corporation . Government engineers capable of building and operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of efficiency which a recent survey attributes to the workers in the Federal arsenals , can surely develop hydro-electric power in Alabama . Why not give them a chance ? In any event two arguments  --  aside from financial considerations  --  seem to us decisive against the Ford offer . ( 1 ) Henry Ford is not immortal . Long before a hundred years have passed all his corporations will lose his guiding hand and be  --  simply profit-seeking corporations . ( 2 ) This generous grant to Mr. Ford would prove a precedent for overturning what little protection the public has gained through the Water Power Act . Mr. Ford 's main concern is with cheap power for his own enterprises and not with fertilizer . Cheap fertilizer would be dear at the cost of private monopoly of hydro-electric power . This is the time for the Government to recover for the people their black coal ; not to give away their " white coal . "
