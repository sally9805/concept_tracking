BENARES again ! The bend of the Ganges that first came to view glittered and flashed like a scimitar held under the sun . It was three o'clock in the afternoon when we entered the Holy City . From the distant bridge over which we walked , the turrets and towers of the thronging temples rose to the sky that burned like a turquoise shell . Stone upon stone , ? yellow , gray and brown , ? houses upon houses , rose tier upon tier ; some had blue doors and windows , and some red ; but each and all breathed only one spirit : it was the city of holiness raised above the world on the trident of Shiva . Even the monkeys in the temple of the Mother seemed holy to me . Benares can not be described . It is held aloft on the trident of holiness ? no description can come near it . I can only set down a few impressions as background to my experiences there . I expected to be disappointed , for I had come to it after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of disappointment ? I felt its overwhelming majesty . It was Brahmanism incarnate ; for no matter what new sect rises amongst us , in Benares it will find a temple and worshipers . In truth , the long arm of the Eternal Religion that abides here reaches out and sustains any new religious experience that utters itself in any form of worship . Thousands of years , thousands of religious teachers ? Buddha , Shankara , Ramanuj , Nanak , Kabir , and Vive-188 kananda ? all have their place here . It is the vast banyan tree which gives shelter to any spirit that wishes to come to it . Here every arch is a soul story and every roof the footstool of God . There is no other city in the world , unless it be Rome , to which one can point suggesting an image of what Benares means to us . Color on color beat upon us like a changing sea . The tawny minarets of the Beni Madhav rose clear against the intense red of the large gaunt temple-towers next to it ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser houses of worship . And over them all danced the gleaming turquoise sky , on fire with the sun . Men and animals jostled one another as we walked the ancient flagstone , while beside us paced the multitude of pilgrims clad in robes of ochre , yellow , white , and red . The large Shiva bulls . their humps throbbing with heat and fat , rubbed their sleepy gray sides against us . That July afternoon was not a day , but a revelation . No sooner had we entered the city than we felt that the veil of delusions had been torn asunder , giving us a glimpse of the road that we were destined to travel in order to reach the Holy One . It seemed quite natural that every one we met should point out to us the way . In Benares the streets have no names , and houses are not numbered ; yet everyone whom we asked for direction told us which tura of the road to follow . One white-bearded old man said , ' Go to the Spice Market and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , if you do not find anyone to tell you which way to turn , go east ; that will bring you to the Flower-Weavers ' ( garland-makers ) quarters ; turn cast again ? But Shiva Vishnu , what is the use of so much Morino ion ? One step at a time , say the senile and the wise ! Therefore go , brothers , first to the Spice Market , and if you lose your way , it will only fulfill some prophecy or other ? what is life but a fulfilling or defeating of prophecies : Without doubt you will find your Holy One ? Shiva , Shiva ! ' As we took leave of the old man , my brother said , " There is no race on earth that can talk as poetically as we do . Every one of us is born with the peacock 's colors in his imagination . ' We hastened to the Spice Market , then to the cross-roads of the Ten Stallions ; there we turned northward to the embankment called Gem of Gems . Here we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , .. trs old , buttressed and held together like small Gothic churches hugging one another . We went through courtyards of old palaces , flagged as ark as the days when men first Icarned to make flags . We passed i ) eople 's drawing-rooms , laundries , Hower gardens , over yellow sandstone fences , down broken pavements , in and eat of gullies wrought with stones as old as the world itself . Then suddenly we came upon a vast garden enclosed by tall red-brick walls . There was a gate made of blue-black iron bars ; on it two letters were carved is ' , atiskrit : we pushed through this gate into a garden , green with the tierce verdure of the tropics after heavy rain . We did not wait for permission . be grossed our way past a person or tau men or women ? until it seemed , after passing endless bungalows and corridors , that we were held at bay by a sound ? the sound- of a marvelous lion-like intonation of Sanskrit . Both of us felt its power . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven out of a chant . One who wished to cross that ring must know the secret of Immortality . No doubt it was the tiger-voice of the Holy One intoning , ' He has no fear of growth , senility , or death , for he has put on the flame-garb of Immortality . Now with hands of clay he gathers the golden fire of deathlessness . He is stiller than the mountains , hence swifter than the swiftest flight of man 's mind : subtler than the subtlest , as a tiger in the blackness of the forest . He is the Eagle of Eternity flying through the wilderness of Time . He has unlocked the door of soul-ecstasy for the Spirit of men to enter in . Though desireless , he fulfills all desires ! 0 thou fierce silence ! quicken my senses , smite my tongue till it drips with the flaming honey of Truth-Utterance , and this my mortal body becomes Thy Chalice of Immortality . Hari ? One ? Hari Our ? 0-0-m-m ! ' Yet it was not these words , but the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that held us motionless where we stood . He chanted till the sun went down . I know not how long we waited in the vestibule , but at last , when we entered the presence , we found the Holy One seated on a wooden couch and a small brass lamp burning near him . The room was absolutely bare . The red-sandstone walls looked gaunt and hard , the cemented gray floor felt cool under our travel-hot feet . We fell on our faces before Maharajkeshar , the Lion ? the name they gave the Blessed One . It was such a joy and relief to lie there on one 's face ! Every moment I felt that gladness was passing into my heart with a pang . I know not how long we lay thus , prostrate before him . Suddenly we heard him say , ' Rest a long time here . ' Now I looked at him . Yes , he was indeed holy . The power poured from him , infusing all the air of the room with life . It is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the simple radiance of a child 's , yet they were full of maturity ; slanting a bit when he looked sidewayS , their pupils and the whites almost wrinkled with age ; but his gaze was as fresh as a child 's after a night of restful sleep . He had a straight tall forehead and straight brows . His face was lean and strong , there was not an atom of superfluous flesh , nowhere a single line to indicate care or worry . When I looked at his mouth I knew at once that he was old , for his lips were drawn and sunken ; but the youth of his beautiful nose , firmly modeled chin and clear eyes , mitigated the age that had touched his mouth . I learned later on that at the time the Holy One was suffering from a carbuncle on his left shoulder ? it was the pain of it that one saw in his lips . He spoke : ' What brings you here ? ' I answered , ' Problems , my Lord . ' Problems ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western habit of worrying and running the Universe . Whose Universe is it , thine or Brahma 's ? If it is His why not look for Him and find out what He wants from it ? ' But this hate between the East and the West , my Lord . Throughout the East I have heard nothing but distrust of the West . From Egypt to Burmah all men say that the Westerners are thieves , all that they want is oil wells and money . I am afraid this attitude will cause much trouble between Asia and Burope . ' Thou art very tender-hearted , nu . child . But do not rob the heart of the discrimination that is its own . Thou art in need of rest . Sit here and idle away time . Eat sweetmeats and sing songs . The Universe can wait till thou art well ! ' That evening we spent quietly in the bungalow allotted to us by the Holy One . II Next morning about five o'clock we were roused by one of the disciples of the Blessed Master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Ganges . We assented , and were hardly outside our rooms when we heard the thud of human feet . Beat , beat , heat , sounded the bare feet of the oncoming pilgrims . If I were to describe India by a single sound , it would be that beat of the feet of Man . Someone is always walking barefoot and marking the rhythm of pilgrimage ; the dust of illusion darkens our eyes , and the veils of time and space delude our minds ; yet the heart and feet of every Indian know where to search and whither to look for that ultimate Holiness of the Universe ? God . A very short walk brought us to the river bank . The brief morning twilight had already vanished , and the warm white light of clay shimmered on the waters of the Ganges . Every time a woman or a man clad in crimson or saffron dipped in the water the colors broke into a thousand running bits of liquid splendor . Here and there against the half-leaning and half-falling sculptured walls of a temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved like statues in stately procession in an antique world , or like frescoes , suddenly come to life . At last I found myself swimming down the glad currents of the sacred river . The tall stiff embankments of the Gwalior Ghat slipped by me ; half-submerged temples , shrines of an older cult , raised their red turrets as if to erect me , as stroke by stroke I went where the dead were being cremated and their ashes thrown into the Ganges . Now and then I swam past a calm ligure of a Yogi sitting on a fallen temple tower , lost in meditation . Little boats with their painted sides crossed and recrossed my way , yet I swam on to the burning ghat . Death , death alone , I wanted to see . The many colored draperies of the bathing populace , the umbrellas made of coco palms , the chanting priests ? all the moving life against the hard yellow walls of the embankment , delayed me not . I wanted to behold Death . At last I reached the burning ghat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective pyres just catching fire , while the ashes of a third were being thrown into the river . Ah , wonder of wonders . ' Thou-Ands are dying the death that no one can avoid , yet the rest of us live as though we should never die ! ' Those burning pyres sputtered and sang as if life to them was a festival . Suddenly I saw the Holy One . I could not believe my own eyes . Near , yes , right near one of the pyres he stood , with three of his disciples , all dressed in ochre-colored robes . I at once climbed out of the water and went toward them to salute the Maharaj . He said ; ' One of our patients died during the night . We had to cremate him . The weather is so hot that any delay in burning a corpse may cause putrefaction . ' But , Master , why do you have this institution ? Why have a hospital right in the midst of a sanctuary of medi-tation ? ' ' It is a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of his companions , he remarked , ' I think now that the fire is well started you will not need me , so I will go and bathe . Will you all go home after you have finished your work ? ' Then he turned toward me . ' Come , let us bathe and have a swim . ' In a few moments he and I were swimming in the Ganges . He swam wonderfully . Suddenly I remembered the carbuncle growing on his back and urged him not to swim any more . Like a naughty lad he answered , ' I do not think of carbuncles when I am at play . Come , race me against the current ! ' It was hard work for me . I admit he went against the moderate current faster than I. Again we passed the Yogi lost in meditation on the turret of a fallen temple , and the bathers , their glittering purple , orange , russet , and green draperies clinging to their bodies like liquid colors as they came out of the water and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed the red , brown , white , and tawny temples in the fierce light of the sun . Lo , he had sprung like a lion of white flames over the city and flung himself on a black cloud ? that ' elephant of the sky ' as the poet said . At last we reached a place where we saw my brother standing on the edge of the water , with eyes shut chanting to the sun : The Holy Man looked at me , his dark brown eyes twinkling with mischief . He said , ' I suppose thou canst no more sit still and meditate on God than a tiger can concentrate on vegetarianism ! ' I am not pious like my brother , ' I replied meekly . Ha , thou tallest him pious , him who has beheld God ? ' the Holy One ejaculated . Has he truly seen God , my Lord ? ' Cant thou not smell the fragrance of his soul ? If thy spirit 's nostrils can not inhale it , can words give thee the perfume of yon man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I inquired and affirmed in the same breath . ' Ask him . He will tell thee , ' said the Holy One very simply . We left my brother to meditate on the river bank , and went on toward the Holy Man 's abbey . Again I noticed how beautiful some of the figures looked clad in their wet raiments . The rhythm of their barefooted walk and the close clinging wet colors made the women seem creatures from some ancient myth . Here and there a porter , bare to the waist , would pass with a heavy weight on his head . To see so much of a body , such pleasing skin , such play of muscles was a strange contrast to New York , where everyone is dressed to the hilt . Here in India the bronze men carrying loads on their heads looked stately ? in fact no king is so majestic as men or women carrying loads on their heads . The dignity of it is unsurpassable . No matter how cultivated a society grows its toilers will always look more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a load is greater than the wearer of a crown , ' Benares told me . The Holy One who had been walking silently beside me suddenly remarked : ' If the Without is so beautiful , how much more beautiful the Within must be ! ' But , Master , ca n't I tarry a bit at the door of the Without ? ' He answered : ' Thou dost not tarry ; thou dost hasten to catch the glamour of the apparent . The pursuer of the thunder can not afford to tarry . But he who sits above the thunder cloud in the centre of Heaven tarries former . He need not move any more , for all things are happening before him . The centre of the Within is the seat of vantage from which to see the drama ? the players , on the stage as well as off , and the audience too . Take that seat and none other . Come Within , my son ! ' We were at the gate of the abbey . We entered and again passed the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen sick people being carried in . In the next building we saw patients lying in bed close to the wide open windows . Why a hospital , and a day clinic as well ? ' I asked . ' How did you come to have them here ? ' My son , it is the punishment for doing good . Go , change thy dress and come back to my chamber . I will explain it to thee . ' When I entered his room again the odor of sandalwood greeted my breath . The walls looked cool and hard and the floor on which I stood felt cooler yet . This was the first time I had walked barefoot in thirteen years ; my feet were sore . I had almost lost my entire faith in the rhythm and beauty of barefoot walking . But I felt the same sense of a strange power pervading the room . On the floor were seated two young ladies , an old gentleman , their father , and a young monk in yellow , crouching before the Maharaj as though bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated . I am glad , ' he said , ' that thy feet pain thee . That will start the easing of the pain in thy soul . ' He turned to the others ; ' What was I talking about ? ? I remember ? the hospital which is a punishment for doing good . ' ' How so , my Lord ? ' questioned the old gentleman . ' Even thou , an old man , dost ask me that question also ? Well ? it all began one day about eleven years ago when one man , a pilgrim , fell ill . I , who was meditating with a brother disciple under a big tree decided to stop meditating , and care for the man who had fallen sick by the roadside . He was a lean money-lender from Marwar and he had come to Benares to make a rich gift to some temple in order to have his way to Heaven paved in solid gold . Poor fellow , he did not know that any gift made thus binds a soul all the more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he recovered and could return to Marwar , to lend more money , I suppose . But the rascal did me an evil turn . He spread the news all along his way that if people fell sick near my big tree I took care of them . So very soon two more people came and fell sick at the prearranged place . What else could my brother disciple and I do but take care if them ? Hardly had we cured them when we were pelted with more sick folk . It was a blinding shower . I saw in it all a terrible snare : beyond a doubt , Ht , if I went on taking care of the sick , bye and bye I should lose sight of God . ' Pity can be a ghastly entanglement to those who do not discriminate , and there I stood , with a wall of sick men between me and God . I said to myself , ' like Hanuman , the monkey , leap over them and fling thyself upon the Infinite . " But somehow I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Juncture a lay disciple of mine came to see me ; he recognized my predicament and , good soul that he was , he at once got hold of a doctor and an architect , and set to work to build the hospital . Very strange though it seems , other illusions cooperated with that good rot , . man to help him ? the money-changer , the first fellow I cured , sent an additional load of gold and built the day clinic . In six years the place was a solid home of delusion where men put their soul-evolution back by doing good . Shiva , Shiva ! ' But , Master , I notice that your own disciples , boys and young girls , work there ? ' I put in my question . Yes , like these two young ladies here , other young people come to me to serve God . Well , youth suffers from the delusion that it can do good . But I have remedied that somewhat ; I let them take care of the sick as long as their outlook on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my disciples show signs of being caught in the routine of good works ? like the scavenger 's cart that follows the routine of removing dirt every morning ? I send that soul off to our retreat in the Himalayas , there to meditate and purify his soul . When he regains his God-outlook to the fullest , if he wishes , I let him return to the hospital . Beware , beware : good can choke up a soul as much as evil . ' But if someone does not do it , how will good be done ? ' questioned the old gentleman in a voice full of perplexity . Live so , ' replied the master in a voice suddenly stern , ' Live so that by the sanctity of thy life all good will be performed involuntarily . My children do not try to do good . Live like the holy man , my whilom teacher , the Air-Eater ; live so that evil will never dare come near where you live , and all the good will be accomplished of itself . For , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt infect him with disease , so the doer of good lives in perpetual fear of his soul being diseased with the evil he carts away from the house of life . He does not know into what danger the routine of good work can plunge his God-seeking soul . The pestilence of improving others may kill his spirit . Try the safer way ? live so that by your living all good deeds will be done unconsciously . ' At this moment my brother entered the room , dressed in fine ivory-colored silk . He had a look in his eyes that was not of this world . But my mind was after another thing . I asked the Blessed One , ' What did the Air-Eater teach you , my Lord ? ' ' 0 thou soul of vulgar probing , dost thou not know what I learned from him I can utter only through my living ? If the fragrance of my living does not call the soul to suck the honey of eternal bliss , then ? but I will tell thee one thing more , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last visit I made to him , some time after he had entered his mountain cavern . I reached the spot in April . All the hills were dry , every scrap of the earth was parched , almost cracked with the dry heat . When I reached the cave-mouth at midday , I was fainting with thirst . I saw him come out , a man old , ah , old as this city of Benares . His hair was like threads of white silk , his eyes were sunken like large lamps in a misty cave . He gave me a drink of water out of a black shell . I drank on and on ? it seemed that I could never have enough . I had no desire to look at anything . Finally , when I had drained the last long drop , I raised my eyes to see my master ; but lo , I beheld only but for a moment his back at the cavern-mouth . Then he was gone ! I knew what it meant ? I had lost him ! I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thy soul 's thirstiness . " But there was no time to rebuke myself ? somehow I must attain that man ! So I sat down to meditate . I meditated about five hours . Yet no answer from the Air-Eater . Darkness was shutting clown upon me . The young bears were linking their voices together in the upper woods and shook the echoes in all directions . The stars came out and questioned me . Again I plunged myself into meditation and not before the first faint preening of the wings of dawn did I emerge therefrom . Then I felt a cool something resting on my hand . Hooked carefully ? it was the chin of a fawn , dripping with dew . I looked beyond ? a pair of small ruby eyes glowed near by . As if they caught my glance and took the hint , they disappeared . The fawn , breathed more easily , and raised its chin ; I gently stroked its nose and forehead with my hand . Turning my gaze from the deep brotherhood that danced in its eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivered questioningly like the beckoning finger of a man ? it is a terror-rousing sight : do not let the stars question you ! Suddenly they stopped those heartbreaking signs and fled . The small Himalayan sparrow set the theme of dawn with two notes . After a pause of several moments he repeated them half a dozen times , then stopped . Like a long call of a flute rose a silver light in the east . Again the bird answered . Again came the flutings of silver light in the east . The fawn , now standing near me almost whistled a cry . That was the signal ? now began the cymbal crash of gold all over the sky : color upon color , bird note upon bird note , forest upon forest tore the vestments of night into ribands and shreds of silver , gold , purple , and green . Then like the groaning of drums tine bellow of the bison came . It startled me . I looked around and the fawn , scenting fear from my movement , fled ; while , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holy man from his cave : The sky was by now two wings of ; lowing sapphire , on which flew the on , the Eagle of Gold . ? I spent nearly three weeks waiting for the holy Air-Eater to come out of his cave . I never saw him . At last one day in deep meditation the secret gashed through my mind . ' Here the Holy One paused . A great light shone in his eyes . The whole room was filled with glory ; the man before us was no more a man , but a song ? not from some other voice ? but aching in our own throats . Yes , that was the secret : perfect identity of each one of us with all . Alas , hardly had that glorious light broken out when again it vanished . ' Then , ' he continued slowly , all the radiance gone from his eyes , ' Then I said to myself , " He will not teach me with words ; from now on my instructions must come through Silence " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished lay purpose . After I started clown the hill I could not help looking back over my shoulder . Behold , he was standing there at the cave-mouth , smiling a tender , inscrutable smile . I said to myself over and over again , " Yes , I how , my instructions will come to me through silence now . " I never saw the Air-Eater again . The next time I went to his cave , I stopped at the village first and they told me what I suspected : the Air-Eater had passed onward . ' At this moment the arrival of the ( hector , Saravdikari , interrupted the Holy One 's discourse . That he had a carbuncle we all knew , but none had been told that the Master was to be operated on that day . The young ladies and their father left the room and I noticed that they bowed very low before the Presence , and with the ends of their napkins took the dust from his feet . Is there any sight more noble than men and women bending reverently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture man attains the acme of his art . Before the three had left the room two more monks entered with large fans embossed with red and blue semiprecious stones . With these they began to fan the Master . The doctor , who looked exactly like a bronze Sophocles , began to arrange his weapons on a large sheet of leather which he had spread on the floor . This Sophocles was sombre as well as brown and had very little sense of humor ; he laid out his goods with all the unction of a priest poking among his sacred vessels and bells . I whispered to my brother that there must be the manuscripts of tragedy in this man 's pocket . He whispered back , ' It is likely he has enough bills there to visit tragedies on many a patient . He is our most prominent surgeon ; sometimes they nickname him " the butcher . " ' I looked at the Holy One ; he had , in the meanwhile closed his eyes like one withdrawing himself into the deeps of his own thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you an anmsthetic , ' he said . The Master opened his eyes and added gently , ' I do n't think that is necessary . One of the disciples will assist you while to the others I shall talk philosophy ; that will be my anwsthetic . ' But you will suffer pain . You may bungle my work , ' retorted Sophocles . Oh no , doctor ; I will not spoil the skill of your instruments of torture . Do begin ! ' So they began . Sophocles deftly cut into the carbuncle while the Master described in a quiet even voice the need of Bhakti , Raja , Juana , and Karma Yoga to us . He went on and on with his ideas as the doctor worked with his scalpel . Yet the Blessed One 's tone did not change , nor was there a mark of pain visible anywhere in his face . Once in a while I felt the running and trickling of blood down his back as he paused between sentences , but even that feeling in me was brushed aside by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . The wound was completely bandaged . Now the doctor turned to the Master and asked with a smile , ' Did you feel any pain ? ' ? ' Why should I , doctor ? ' ' I felt the temperature not quite normal on that side of your back . Are you sure you felt no pain ? ' ' How could I ? I was absent from that part of the Universe where you were working . I was present in this part where I discussed philosophy . ' Suddenly the doctor glanced at us and remarked , ' When this man dies one of the most astonishing specimens of Hindu religious culturewillgowith him . ' He bent low , and as the others before him , took the dust from the feet of the Master , then stood up to go . He enjoined his patient to take absolute and perfect rest , then helped the disciple to put the place in order . I was unable to contain myself any longer . I said to the Blessed One , ' You who are so holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor interposed , but the Holy One said , ' I am able to answer the child . ' ' Very well , ' said Sophocles . ' I shall wait till you finish answering . Then I will put you to bee ! . ' ' Doctors and Death are absolute , ' exclaimed the Holy One . ' The reason , my son , why I do not heal myself is that the will here , ' he pointed at his heart , ' turned into ashes long ago . I gave my will to the Will of the Universe . Now I spend my time willing the happiness of all . If in the happi ness of all I incidentally ant to be healed , then my friend the doctor is the incident . If not , why should I eall my will back from the embrace of the Infinite to do here a little repairing upon myself ? No , my son , I would rather not be Holy than stoop to take back a gift to my Beloved ! ' He turned to the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very patient with me ; put me to bed ! ' At this , everyone save the doctor and the two monks with fans left the room . IV The quest of my brother 's face is nothing new . It is the old , the age-old search for the happiness that comes in a flash , but abides with us till death : and which perhaps continues beyond that final event of Life . Who is our brother ? Is he the man we find , or the roan we look for ? Th , , sages of the Upanishad have answered that our brother is He who wears that One Face dwelling in the thousand faces of all life . That Face I have never seen , but as time passes , and as the shadow of age falls across my path , I feel more often in my brother 's face that Absoluteness of truth as well as of love , though onl , for the length of time that a mustard seed may sit steady upon the horn of Shiva bull . I was thinking of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone on the porch of the temple . My brother had gone on a short tour of inspection connected with his medical work . Suddenly I saw my sister coming toward me holding a telegram . At first thought it was from hint , but when she handed it to me , I saw that it was from Benares , from the Holy One . It said only one word : ' Come . ' It was not too cryptic to hide from ? me the final command . Had my brother heard also , I wondered ? I must make ready and go at once . The whole world depended on my reaching Benares without delay . It was hard to say good-bye to my sister , because she asked for nothing . She said , ' Live long . Abide in serenity wherever thou art . I shall fast until thy journey 's end , and that will purify oar hearts and may give thee what thou lost desire . Only the hearts that ore pure can attain what they need . Farewell , farewell ! ' Farewell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . I took a last look at our temple , a glimpse at Shroe Krishna 's face . ' Yes , as long as he sits there , the world will go on , ' I said to myself . If this religion ( lies , wherever that Krishna statue goes , a new temple will be built to enshrine him . Gods live long and compel the tribute of time . Farewell , farewell ! ' I crossed the bridge and drove for the railway station that looks like a place of crimson . Next morning I got off at Benares and went immediately to bathe in the Ganges . It did not take long , but the abut ion in the holy water was a necessary preliminary to visiting the Holy One . I found my brother at the entrance to the monastery . After I had taken the dust from his feet , he led me within . The master was lying on his couch , and two monks in yellow were fanning him . Sunlight poured into the room through the open windows . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a black beard , of about fifteen days ' 4row t 11 , covered it . His eyes were closed , and his forehead once in a great while contracted momentarily , then grew smooth again with the passing of a paroxysm of pain ; but the power was still about him like a garment . He began to speak as if resuming an old familiar conversation . ' My son , ' he said , almost in a whisper , ' as to the eye of the sky , the clouds and stars are in it , and yet contain not all of its intangibility . So are the experiences of man . ' Then suddenly , in a stronger voice , he commanded me , Return to the West ! Thy time for peace has not come . Thou wilt commit some errors yet . Only be pure in spirit ? vanity is the worst impurity ? and through thy errors thou wilt learn . ' He paused , closing his eyes . When he opened them again , they were clear and keen . He said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her criticism these many years , therefore give the West love , till she learn to love this land of the Sages . I am quite clear in what I am saying : love her ; and she will fulfill her destiny . The West still believes that knowledge will give her God : we think that God can be found by Bliss alone . A decade of intense loving will enable her to accomplish a century of God-realization . ' But Holy One , ' I cried , ' I am most pained and bewildered . What of conversion ? Shall I go to the West as a missionary of Brahman ? Is ours a missionary religion ? ' Thou of thyself canst convert no one , my son , ' he replied , ' for thou art not holy . When a saint converts a man to his eternity the saint takes the burden of the man 's sins upon himself . Therefore I say to thee thou maycst not convert , but speak thou of God to any one who has time to waste . ' Holy One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atonement is true ? ' Indeed , my son , only saints may convert others , for when you convert a man you yourself become responsible for him . People should not be converted from one religion to another , but from all religions into the Eternal Religion whose name is Viswarupadarsana  --  which is to behold one 's Own Self as the self of the past , the present , and the future of the Universe . That last conversion , that supreme realization ? the realization of one 's own identity with the existing All ? is the goal to which little human conversions point . Desire then to convert the human into the divine , the temporal into the timeless , to convert all men not to one religion , but to the essence of all religions ! Go , any son , and ask each man to realize that he himself is God . Make thy mistakes like a king , my son , but love with all thy heart . Love ? love . ' His voice became fainter . Go hence now , and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and spoke no more . We bowed and touched our foreheads to the floor and walked noiselessly out of the Presence . V For three days I did not see the Master again . My heart was heavy . In India when a man dies we say he is about to start upon the great journey ? literally ? he makes the supreme change of habitation . ' I relinquish my but to enter my palace , ' say the dying . But must I , after knowing the splendor of his presence , remain behind in the darkened and empty but to wait ? for how long ? I am not able in words to convey the experience of this man . Sick and fragile as he was , the power of his presence charged the very air we breathed until it lived like an organism to bleed at a touch . How many times I had entered his room to find him , The Lion , ' sitting straight on his bed and the people crouched about him on the floor like mice , bowed before his silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to hide my face , I had buried it in his shoes which were cool , like stone . It was the daybreak of my third day in Benares that the Master asked for everyone to be present . Since a hundred people could not be accommodated in his room , we brought him outdoors . He wished to be placed under that mango tree where he had meditated for so many years . A group of disciples and friends surrounded him . In the open he seemed better , his unshaven face did not look so white . He lifted his eyes and gazed at us slowly ; not the least one of us all was hastily passed over . Each one received his message , so far as he could interpret the great glance cast upon him . Then the Holy One spoke : The call has come , my children . I must go . No lamentation ! 1 have taken you upon my back ; I shall nut drop you into the ditch on my way Home ; you shall be in His House with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Even the ultimate sin can not touch the fearless . Whatever I took from my master , I in turn pass on to you . I leave behind me for you all that he taught . I take nothing with me . All knowledge , all benediction , I lay here at my feet for you ; spring from it into the Infinite ! ' He ceased , and we saw that he was in great pain . Suddenly he said , I am in haste , ' and chanted out : ? signing to all of us to chant with him . But his voice was soon drowned under the cry of a hundred men and women : ? Our love had surrounded him like a fence , and he could not depart nor free himself from the entanglement of our affection ; so he had commanded us to chant : and as the intoning engulfed us ? Prrt Herd One ? and our hold relaxed , he slipped through our loosened rasp . Suddenly , as a sword falls through the air , silence fell upon our chanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always so full of expression , now lay expressionless and white . His eves were closed . His mouth grew hard acid rigid . The morning breeze trembled through his hair for a moment . We anointed the corpse with pure sandal oil , covered it with hand-made homespun silk of ochre color , then carried it , bed , cot and all , on our shoulders to the burning ghat . It seemed that all Benares had heard the news , but how I do not know . Other men and women , holy also , had already gathered at the ghat , and the old lady , who taught that All is nothing , that truculent old man who cried there is no God ? both of them had reached the ghat before us . Flowers poured from all directions as we went our way . It was overwhelming . Now it is a law in Benares that if a Holy One dies in the sacred city he is not cremated . His naked body is thrown into currents of the river , to be borne to the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ganges . Even the ! lames are too impure for it ! ' Go , go , on the path of ancient mystery ! ' The old words rang out , and the river received him in her arms ; and swiftly bore him from our sight . We gazed and gazed at the flowers that bated after till they too were lost in the blue distance like bubbles in the sea , After our ablutions and prayers , we returned to the monastery . Now that he was gone , we must remember his injunction to shed no tears . When a holy one departs this life , there can be no official or unofficial mourning . So as soon as we could gather our forces of self-control together , we gave a feast of rejoicing to all Benares . Pilgrims , priests , holy men , beggars , and rajahs ? seven thousand or more came and sang the praise of God . His light shone on all faces and his essence danced in every heart . ' In every human being I am the expected flush upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer alone . Peace returned to my heart with the light from the eyes of my brothers . The following week , I set out on another pilgrimage to the New World . What had I found to bring back with me ? what offering from India in upheaval to America in the heyday of her prosperity ? Only the ancient sweet spices and myrrh , only the old incense of love ; but my orders were plain , and with joy I turned again to the West . I bade good-bye to my brother ; his face is with me now . Next to the Holy One , his is most sacred to me . As for the last time I took the dust from his feet , he said simply : ' Finish thy quest . Remember the warning of the Holy One . Criticize no more ! Buddha blessed the world , and in blessing gave new life . There the miracle ! Farewell ? but come back again and bring to us the face of blessing and benediction from the West . ' I kept looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the first time in my life , I beheld tears in his eyes . Then all was lost to view . But no ? for now on the western horizon I saw dimly , but ever growing more and more clear before me , the beloved Face of my Brother .
