From Berlin came news that she who had learned the music-drama gospel from the lips of the master , she who had created Isolde in America , she who had been called the greatest of Wagnerian singers , was gone . Lilli Lehmann was dead . <P> Last November official Austria celebrated her 80th birthday .

Bellini and Donizetti were her gods . Then she met a little man with burning eyes . He was her mother 's former lover and he told her she must study his music . And so she abandoned her Traviata , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Brnnhilde , an Isolde . Soon she became world renowned as the great Wagner interpreter . In 1885 she went to the U.
