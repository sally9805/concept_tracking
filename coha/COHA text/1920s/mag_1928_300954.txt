GIANT KILLER-Elmer Davis-John Day ( $2.50 ) . <P> MOSES-Louis Untermeyer-Harcourt Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> Debunking has been of recent years the profitable pastime of biographers , and the relentless preoccupation of Bible scholars . Poaching on the preserves of both , a novelist now spins an entertaining yarn to debunk David , and a poet resorts to prose to do something of the sort for Moses . <P> Himself a Jew , Poet Untermeyer understood the tragedy of Jewish exile in Egypt , understood the something-more-than-Jew which enabled Moses to organize the return to Palestine . This something more Untermeyer fixes at 50% Egyptian blood , combined with upbringing at the sophisticated Egyptian court . The bulrush theory is but a myth concocted for publicity purposes when the Pharaoh 's daughter found herself with child of a passionate Semitic lover . <P> His non-Jewish half gave Moses dispassionate insight into Hebrew nature-thus he chose not to enter Canaan knowing that it was the promised land only as long as it remained a promise . ( The Bible claims , on the contrary , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign light of love . ) Untermeyer notes radical differences between Joshua 's matter-of-fact record , and Nath 's beautified narrative : Joshua itemizes the miraculous God-sent path through the Red Sea as matter of calculated tides and wind . <P> Untermeyer 's interpretation is shrewd , and his language masterly ; but unconvincing his modernized conversation in the mouths of prince and prophet . <P> Elmer Davis , on the other hand , is sufficiently master of the art of human speech to reconstruct the converse of garrulous though ancient Hebrews . It seems that David did n't kill the giant after all . Coming by lucky chance upon dead Goliath , he was clever enough to cut off the giant 's head , and claim a superhuman victory . His whole career glittered with similar shrewd opportunism , alternating with cowardly lapses which the loyal Joab covered . Joab did all the killing , David got all the credit . <P> Giant Killer is eminently good reading for its new slant on a familiar story , and for its dramatic elaboration of scrimmages in love and war .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
