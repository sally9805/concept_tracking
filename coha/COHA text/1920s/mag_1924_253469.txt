According to The New York Journal of Commerce , the greatest chapter in the history of American finance was about to be written . That newspaper had " exclusive information " that billionaire Henry Ford intended to open a bank on Wall Street and would most probably seek an alliance with the Rockefeller interests . This would mean , said the Journal somewhat childishly , " the single addition of more than $1,000,000,000 of assets , a sum sufficiently large not only to make financial New York notice it , but also welcome it . " It is well known that Mr. Ford has enormous cash reserves and that he could easily establish a bank in Wall Street if he so desired . But this chapter of history was not to be written , as the following telegram to TIME indicated : <P> " Report of our seeking banking arrangement entirely unfounded . <P> " EDSEL B. FORD .
