txt Industrial preferred stocks are being offered at prices some of which are bargains . Even the best , well-seasoned issues with a long dividend record are offered at prices to yield from 7% to 10% , while money may be had around 6% . Bank statements , too , are showing a steady improvement . Many of these senior issues have little or no prior capital liabilities , such as bonds and mortgages . Many do , in fact , enjoy a first claim to the great liquid and physical assets as well as the earnings of corporations engaged in the essential industries of this country . A list of thirty-four representative preferred stocks reveals the fact that those of only three companies re , mained above $100 a share during the recent slump in the stock market . They were the preferred of American Car &; Foundry , U. S. Steel and Woolworth . This is in contrast with the fact that during or since the high prices of 1919 every one of the thirty-four , with the exception of six , sold above par . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends by five important companies may have been a contributory cause to the yielding of higher grade issues in sympathy . But , certainly , the price decline and the dividend omissions are , in common , the effect of a severe industrial depression . It should be noted that opportunities to buy good stocks occur only on similar occasions and circumstances . It is also interesting to note that four of the five issues that omitted recent dividends are cumulative , a feature that guarantees the sincerity of an alleged effort to conserve working capital for proper purposes . ? BARGAINS IN STEIN , ! U. S. Steel 7% cumulative preferred ranged from $1172,4 : in 1919 to a recent low of $105 . For each share of this issue there was a working capital of $165.30 , of which $81.25 were in ca : . h and securities on Dec. 31 , 1920 . The earnings per share in six years to that date were $245.50 , of which there were retained after all dividends $129.80. - Although the prior capital liabilities amounted to $162.80 a share . they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $450 a share . The sta- bility of this issue , even during the periods of frightful liquidation of the past year , is as much due to the corporation 's policy of publicity and its frank and complete fin*TIrial statements as to its other merits . The twentyyear record of those statements are shown in detail in the Dow-Jones " Tabulated History of U. S. Steel , " published in The Wall Street Journal of April 19 , 1921 . Other preferred steel stocks of merit are Bethlehem 8% cumulative , Republic 7% cumulative and Crucible 7% cumulative . Bethlehem shows the greatest assets and earnings . But this is partly offset by a high funded debt , as indicated by prior capital liabilities of $482.11 a share . The assets and earning ability of Republic and Crucible are about equal , although much less than those of Bethlehem . But their prior capital liabilities are also relatively much less . Bethlehem sold at a recent low of $9314 , Republic $79% and Crucible $77 . Such bargains are rarely recorded .

This should be taken as indicating a profitable field for investment . TEE RAILWAY EQUIPMENTS American Car &; Foundry 7% non-cumulative preferred sold as high as $119 in 1919 and to a recent low of $108 . It had a working capital of $125.10 a share , of which $74.80 was cash and securities on April 30 , 1921 . In the six years to that date it earned $183.80 , of which it retained $93.30 after all dividends for each share . There are no prior capital liabilities . American Locomotive 7% cumulative preferred is in an exceptionally strong position . It had a working capital of $149.30 a share , of which $67 were in cash and securities on Dec. 31 , 1920 . In the six and one-half years to that date it earned $176.20 , of which it retained $105.90 after all dividends for each share . Prior capital liabilities of $7.72 a share are practically none . Its price-range from 10914 to 98i4 shows a stability equal to that of Car &; Foundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin Locomotive 7% cumulative preferred , Pressed Steel Car 7% non-cumulative preferred and Railway Steel Spring 7% cumulative preferred . While the last two have not the earning ability of Baldwin , they both have the advantage of no funded debt . The depression of the equipments to bargain prices is due in part to governmental meddling with the carriers . Maintenance of the rolling stock was neglected even be- fore the war . Another cause of low equipment stock prices is the activity of visionaries suggesting without adequate figures that much of this country 's commerce will be carried by motor truck and airship . It is about , a year since the head of a prominent rubber tire concern was credited with the statement that had the motor truck been developed 20 years earlier we should not now have had half our railroads . All this is favorable for reducing the equipments to the bargain counter and improve rather thin deter their earning ability . OTHER BARGAINS Woolworth 7% cumulative preferred had a pricerange identical with that of Steel preferred . The esteem in which it is held is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to Dec. 31 , 1920 . Of this it retained $158.30 after all dividends . Its working capital is also high at $167. b0 a share and the relative prior capital liabilities almost none at $12.70 . The funded debt of Sears-Roebuck is relatively high . But that the company can employ the new capital to advantage is indicated by earnings of $1,058 a share of its 7% cumulative preferred , of which it retained $605 after all dividends in the six years to Dec. 31 , 1920 . A STUDY IN PREFERRED STOCKS A study of these 34 representative , active , industrial , preferred stocks shows that many are selling at prices on which the yield is 10% . Although limited as to earnings and to assets , the great excess of both should convince anyone that the values of many are assured beyond doubt . The table which accompanies this study gives the best examples of the preferred stocks of American industry which are listed on the New %York Stock Exchange . It shows , for the 34 issues , par value , dividend rate and character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock outstanding , the aggregate of cash and securities , working capital , and prior capital liabilities , such as bonds , mortgages and long term notes , are shown as of Dec. 31 , 1920 . It also shows the earnings available for dividends of the entire preferred issues and the amount retained after all dividends , including those to common stock , during the six years to Dec. 31 , 1920 . To show concisely how these figures compare with the high of 1919 and the recent low prices of the shares , they are also given on a per share of preferred basis against those prices . This concise tabulation also gives the reader a better basis for computing the relative values of the various issues . Most of the figures have been taken , directly or by deduction , from the Dow-Jones tabulation , ' " Industrial Expansion From 1914 to 1921 , " published in The Wall Street Journal of July 6 , 1921 .
