Strong Boy ( Fox ) . Full-length , light films which substitute character comedy for slapstick , and homely atmosphere for romantic , amuse and charm adult audiences but rarely do well at the boxoffice . John Ford , who directed Four Sons and The Iron Horse , has now had a lot of fun showing how a muscle-bound baggage smasher carved his way in the world . To Smasher Victor McLaglen 's girl , " promotion " meant a white collar ; to Smasher McLaglen it meant a job he liked . Told to pick his own job after he kept a trunk from falling on the daughter of a railroad director , he chose to superintend the Lost &; Found Department . Saving the Queen of Lisonia 's jewels from train robbers , he was told again to pick his job . He became a fireman . Best shot of this smart film- Strong Boy and the lost child . <P> Wild Orchids ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . The increasing sophistication of the picture business is well demonstrated by this story of a foreign prince , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been told before but never so effectively . In the 1914 manner of the cinema , it was a story of marital infidelity as crude and tawdry as its papier-mch settings . As done in the 1919 epoch , it was a heavy-footed charade , overburdened with its setting . Now , a vehicle for Greta Garbo 's disturbing shadow , it moves lightly , even wittily , and the lady 's momentary struggle between her husband 's coldness and the impetuosity of the prince takes place against a new and interesting background , handled with laudable control-the tea-plantations of Java . Lewis Stone 's urbanity , is rewarded by his wife 's decision to stay with him after all , following an episode in which Stone holds the amorous Nils Asther against a tree at the point of his double-barreled tiger-rifle , while a real , terrifying tiger snarls toward the sound-device . Best shot-Greta Garbo drying her feet . <P> Christina ( Fox ) . Janet Gaynor is the first picture actress to suggest convincingly real , virginal youth . Her beautiful and delicate charm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in a pretty , painstaking , and rather inane film about a Dutch girl who falls in love with a circus performer , and , after difficulties , is united to him . Best shots-the Dutch village . <P> The Wild Party ( Paramount ) . In one of those colleges where all the girls are good-looking , talk musical comedy English , make love instead of study , and wear clothes that must have cost their parents a pretty penny , Clara Bow falls in love with a professor . Warner Fabian wrote the plot and John V. A. Weaver the drawling dialog of a story that has no connection with the verses by the same title published last year by Joseph Moncure Marsh . The sound-device , recording the Bow voice for the first time , sometimes lags behind , sometimes careers ahead of episodes which arraign young irresponsibility for the purpose of illustrating it and which are not kept from being tedious by their waggish , unjustified affectation of daring . Best shot-Joyce Compton as a tattletale.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
