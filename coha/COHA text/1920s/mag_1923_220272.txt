Not alone Wall Street , but the entire country is now engaged in conjecture as to the exact interpretation to be placed upon this pronounced advance in commodity prices . While Mr. Babbitt is immensely cheered at the immediate business prospect in 1923 , yet the disastrous memories of 1920 and 1921 are still fresh in his mind ; he is wondering whether business is entering into such another swift and unhealthy " boom " as he experienced in 1919 and 1920 . For the most part , anxiety on this score seems groundless . The 1919 boom arose from the world shortage of goods after the war , and our huge consequent exports which were recklessly financed with long-term banking credits . These latter , together with the additional strain placed upon the banks by the great rise in commodity prices , came upon a money market already badly inflated by war conditions . When our credit facilities were exhausted liquidation naturally followed , with the result which is still a nightmare to Mr. Babbitt.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
