txt Controller . Charles L. Craig submitted yesterday to the Charter Revision Commission . his " home ride " charter , providing for the largest measure of home rule for New York City possible under the present State constitution , and which he declared was really a " constitution " for New York City . The proposed charter ; which contains only 7,000 words , instead of the more than 400,000 words in the present city charter , places power over all details of city government , now specified in the present- charter and various legislative enactments , in a municipal assembly , composed of the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen . It authorizes the city to own , control and operate its public utilities and to regulate or to lease , purchase or acquire by condeennation those privately owned within the city , and would automatically , upen its adoption , supersede the Transit Commission , the Public Service Commission , so far as its jurisdiction in the city is concerned , and all other State boards and commissions having exclusively city ' jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rates of charges for service rendered by any corporation holding a franchise for the use/ of the streets , which would not only permit it to prescribe the fare on transit lines , but to fix rates for practically every other public service corporation . In addition , it contains the following addi'ilonal broad provision in Section 21 of the grant of powers to the city : " To engage in any business or enterprise within the City of New York which may be engaged in by any person , firm . or corporation by virtue of any fran , chise in the City of New York hereto'fore granted by or under the authority of the State of New York , the City of New York or any of the municipalities consolidated therewith . " Calls It " Comprehensive . " .  --  anis is pretty comprenenstve , was the comment of ex-Justice Francis Scott . Chairman of the commission . " I should say that it was a-dandy , " paid Borough President Edward Riegelmann of Brooklyn . The proposed charter empowers the city to . determine the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , powers and duties of all persons rendering the city service , except elective officers , but including emPloYes of county offices . It gives the city control over all departments , Including police , fire and education , empowers the city to grant franchises for the use of the streets and other public places for periods not exceeding twentyfive years , and provides for the super  --  easion of all conflicting laws . - Provision is made for a new elective . Ifficial , ' the Corporation Counsel , whose Apiary is fixed at $20,000 a year . The of the Mayor and Controller advanced to $25,000 a year each and " the-salaries of the Aldermen from $3,000 to : $5,000 , the question of whether there shall be a reduction in the number of Aldermen being left in abeyance , but the salaries of the President of the Board of Aldermen and the five Borough . Presidents are continued at 410,000 each . Increase &; powers are granted to the Controller in the matter of settling claims against the city and in the purchase of real estate , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three citywide officials , the Mayor , Controller and President of the Board of Aldermen . The vote of at - least two of these city-wide officials is made necessary for a majority in any vote of the Board of Estimate . - Subject to Referendum . The charter providesthat it shall be subject to a ref  --  renduin , and shall take effect on Jan. 1 , 1923 , if passed by the Legislature and ratified by a referendum by - that time . , The proposed charter was received With every appearance of both respedt and opposition at the meeting of the commission in , Mr. Craig 's office in the - Municipal Building . None of the members had had a chance to study it , as it had been received from the printer and Sent to them less than two hours before ; the meeting began , so detailed discusaton was deferred until the meeting next Vireek . Although it was indicated that ! the - majority of the - commission had no Mention of accepting Mr. Craig 's char  --  n its entirety , the opinion was - exthat he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - rule " charter that the consertive the commission would tely  --  to go - further in attempts - to ailepi-otrdse than they might have done ateuryo/t fife meeting , the commission ognixed one principle of Mr. Craig.by opting on motion of Borough Pres ! - dent Edward Riegelmann of Brooklyn a resolution declaring that it was the sense of the ' commission that the new charter should be a " short " charter with provision for a municipal assembly or other local legislative body . Mr. Craig 's charter came under fire immediately after he presented it . " I realize that there are several controversial matters in it , such as the provision for municipal regulation and operation of public utilities , " he said . " But the rest of it contains nothing novel . So far as everything else is concerned , at least one or two cities have not these powers . " " It is a remarkable piece of work . " said ex-Justice Francis M. Scott . Chairman of the commission . " There are sonic things I do n't care for , especially the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " l ' think that might be a mistake , because we might get a legal adviser opposed to the Mayor 's policies , " said Mr. Riegelmann . ? , " We have an elected Attorney Gen- , era , a similar officer , " said Mr. Craig . " My suggestion is based upon experience as well as observation . " " Having been Controller , I agree with Mr. Craig . " said Herman A. Metz . " You would n't get ? along any better with an elected Corporation Counsel , " said Judge Scott . who formerly held that office . " The Controller and the Corporation Counsel always elsagree . " " Before we shoot the Controller 's charter to pieces , I think we ought to give him a vote of thanks , " said Mr. Riegelmann . This was done , and Judge Scott asked if Air . Craig had included any salary increases . The latter said that he had . " Good for you . " said Judge Scott . " I am. in favor of that . " Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to appoint a committee to draft a charter on behalf of the committee . " 1 think we ought to declare whether we will go on the principle of a short charter . " said Mr. Craig . " I think so . too , " said Judge Scott . Lewis L. Delafield expressed belief that it was too early for such a declaration . Alderman John J. Keller said he favored such a declaration . " I think we should settle it today , " said Mayor Hylan . Mr. Riegelmann then offered a resdlution that it was the sense of the commission that a short charter with provision for a Municipal Assembly or other local legislative body should be adopted . It was carried unanimously , and there was another discussion as to whether the commission should send Mr. Craig 's charter to persons and organizations . " l think such action might imply approval by the commission , " said Mr. Riegelmann . " I intend to take a couple of shots at it . Maybe more than that . " Mr. Craig said he thought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salaries of the Mayor and Controller are Increased to $25,000 each . " said Mr. Riegelmann . " There may be some objection when I confer with the downtrodden Union of Borough Presidents . " " Trust me with sending out a letter and I guarantee that there wo n't be any implication that I approve it , " said Judge Scott , and it was decided that the commission would send out copies of the charter to . get expressions of opinion . The commission adjourned until next Tuesday after deciding to make , Tuesday the regular weekly meeting day .
