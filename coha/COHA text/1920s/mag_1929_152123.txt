De Saint Phalles <P> When the Manhattan brokerage house of de Saint Phalle &; Co. last month divulged ( to customers , thence to prying newsgatherers ) its balance sheet , the other 614 member houses of the New York Stock Exchange confessed their surprise . Neither brokerage houses , such as de Saint Phalle , nor banking houses , such as J. P. Morgan &; Co. , are inclined to follow corporation practice and announce their financial standing . De Saint Phalle &; Co. , revealed total assets of some $33,000,000 . Last week it appeared that the same prosperous , socially prominent de Saint Phalles* would sponsor yet another innovation . Within two months , their office ( at No. 11 Wall St. ) will boast Manhattan 's first electric quotation board . This device , which will separate many a " board boy " from his $15-a-week job , mechanically marks up prices as swiftly as the new tickers , giving five quotations for each stock : the last night 's close , day 's opening , high , low and latest . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station of the Teleregister types it on a keyboard . Each depression of the key sends an electric impulse over the wires to the brokers ' boards . Western Union , 60% stockholders in the Teleregister Corp. , believes it can cope with a 10,000,000-share day . <P> *At the head of the firm is Fal de Saint Phalle , whose clubs include the Knickerbocker , the Tuxedo , and the Turf and Field , whose wife is the daughter of Mrs. E. Guidet Auchincloss , of Paris . The wives of partners Alexandre and Count Andre de Saint Phalle are sisters . They were Helen and Jacqueline Harper , daughters of Donald Harper , of Paris , who has been mentioned for U. S. Ambassador to France . His son , Donald Jr. , is a partner in de Saint Phalle &; Co . Partner Francois de Saint Phalle manages the Philadelphia office . Before forming the present firm , Fal de Saint Phalle was a partner in Gude , VVinmill &; Co . The two houses work closely together in many an important deal . Branches of de Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Monte Carlo , Cannes . Brussels , Antwerp , Berlin , Zurich . . . .
