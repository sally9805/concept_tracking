txt Maurice E. Connolly , who has been facing charges of conspiracy to defraud the city in contracts for sewers and other public works , resigned last night as Borough President of Queens . Mr. Connolly , who is the third Borough President of Queens to go out of office under charges , ascribed his resignation to the refusal of the Board of Estimate earlier in the day to grant his request for an appropriation of $100,000 to help defray the expenses of his defense in the proceedings before Clarence J. Shearn , the commissioner appointed by Governor . Sniith to investigate whether or not , the . charges could be substantiated sufficiently to warrant Mr. Connolly 's removal . Commissioner Shearn , who has been conducting , a preliminary investigation with secret hearings , was to have begun public hearings next Monday . Mr. Shearn declined to comment on Mr. Connolly 's resignation , but it was learned that he intended to make a report to the Governor , based on evidence obtained in his investigation so far . The general opinion was that with Mr. Connolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped , ti as Mr. Shearn was appointed a commissioner under the Public Officers law and no public officer other than Mr. Connolly is involved . It was the opinion of persons familiar with the investigation that the refusal of the Board of Estimate to appropriate $100,000 for Mr. Connolly 's defense was only one of several reasons for his resignation . It was pointed out that passage of a law at the recent session of the Legislature making it possible to impose a $100,000 penalty upon each person subpoenaed as a witness outside the State who refused to appear had been followed by the appearance of several missing witnesses and was likely to result in the appearance of several more . Mr. Connolly 's resignation also followed the recent action brought by the Federal Government for $1,376,134. for alleged unpaid income taxes against John M. Phillips , said to be the head of the Queens " sewer pipe ring " and one of the most important missing witnesses . Statement by Connolly . Mr. Connolly announced his resignation at his home in Forest Hills , and said it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this morning . The announcement was made in the following statement : The city having declined any appropriation with which to meet the necessary expenses of my defense . which , by reason of the long period and numerous items to be covered , would be a burden much greater than I can bear , I have decided to resign my office , moved so to do by the additional fact that the City Administration resolved , in. any event , to make a thorough investigation in its own interest of the manner , method and cost of improvements in Queens Borough , from which investigation , I am advised by the engineering staffs and experts , it will fully appear that Queens Borough has as fine a sewer system and at as reasonable a cost as has been laid anywhere . In view of the dissatisfaction that has been made prevalent in Queens Borough by reason of my inability to meet the expense necessary for a defense I determined that the best interests of all would . be served by yielding the office to some one else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whoever he may be , a competent and satisfactory administration . ? Resigns in Eight Words . Mr. Connolly , when questioned further about his resignation , said : " The statement speaks for itself . I shall have nothing more to say at this time . " Mr. Connolly also wrote out his resignation , which he will file in the City Clerk 's office in the Municipal Building today . It reads : " I hereby resign as Borough President of Queens .

Held Office Since 1911 . Mr. Connolly has been Borough President of Queens since October , 1911 , when he succeeded Lawrence Gresser , who had been removel by Governor Dix on recommendation of Samuel H. Ordway , who had been appointed a Commissioner by Governor Hughes . Mr. Ordway found that Mr. Gresser had been inefficient and incompetent and had neglected his duties . Mr. Gresser was the only Borough President of Queens who was removed . Joseph Bermel , his predecessor , resigned under charges . Bermel , Gresser and Connolly all were elected to the Borough Presidency as reformers . Bermel defeated " Curly Joe " Cassidy , who was the first Queens Borough President and later was sentenced to prison for selling a Supreme Court nomination to William Willett . President his long term as Borough President Mr. Connolly built up the most powerful political machine that ever existed in Queens . For many years he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Democratic organizations in the other boroughs , although he at times was in alliance with all of them . - - In 1925 Mr. Connolly and his organization supported John F. Hylan for renomination to the Mayoralty and carried the borough for Mr. Hylan by a small majority over Mayor Walker . In the last five or six years reports that the cost of public works in Queens was greater than in any other borough have been current . The Meyer legislative investigating committee made an attempt to show that Mr. Connolly had permitted contractors to profit greatly , but fell short of proof of any wrongdoing on his part . Harvey Initiated Inquiry . The charges of corruption and graft in connection with Queens contracts was revived last Fall by Alderman George U. Harvey as a result of what was considered the excessive cost of the Jamaica sewer . The cost of the sewer was assessed on a large area of Queens supposed to be benefited by its construction , and there were strong protests from property owners , who alleged that the $16,000,000 cost was from $6,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey , who had been the unsuccessful fusion candidate for President of the Board of Aldermen in 1925 , first made informal charges to Governor . Smith and then filed with the Governor formal charges prepared by Henry H. Klein , his counsel . The Governor appointed Supreme Court Justice Townsend Scudder as a commissioner to investigate and hear the charges and the latter appointed Emory R. P.uckner as his counsel . Mr. Connolly at once retained Max D. Steuer. who succeeded in having the courts oust Justice Scudder on the ground that a Supreme Court Justice as a State officer could not accept the other appointment . The Governor appointed former Supreme Court Justice Shearn to succeed Justice Scudder . and Mr. Shearn continued Mr. Buckner , who already had made progress in his investigation , as his counsel . Inquiry About to Open . Mr. Shearn continued the investigaiCas. with renewed energy , and it is tnderstood that he and Mr. Buckner were ready to produce some interesting testimony at the public hearings to have been begun on Monday . Persons connected with the investigation were not inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant Mr. Connolly 's $100.000 for his defense constituted the only reason for his resignation . It was pointed out that it would not have cost Mr. Connolly anything to have taken the stand next Monday and denied any connection with Phillips 's sales of sewer pipe to Queens contractors . Persons connected with the investigation also expressed belief that the return of four witnesses , Albert Decker , Harry S. Hart , James Deegan and James dallo , under the new Missing Witnesses law , might have had something to do with the resignation . It was said that Mr. Shearn probably would report to the Governor on the result of his investigation so far , and that he could make recommendation for further criminal action if he believed the evidence taken in the secret hearings warranted it . Mr. Steuer and Mr. Buckner , as well as Mr. Shearn , declined to comment on Mr. Connolly 's resignation . Klein for Further Inquiry . Mr. Klein , attorney for Alderman Harvey , author of the charges against Mr. Connolly , said he would write to Governor Smith urging another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor should appoint a special Attorney General to present I he charges before an Extraordinary Grand Jury , " said Mr. Klein . " It is up to the Governor to see that some use is made of all the evidence that has been gathered at the expense of the city . The people of Queens are entitled to expect that action shall be taken which once for all will rid the borough of the political banditry which has existed in public contracts for many years . " Alderman Harvey said at his home in Flushing : " I fully expected Connolly would resign . I never expected that he would stand trial . The evidence was so strong that I believed he never would dare to do so . Mr. Steuer has been trying to stir up sympathy for him to give him a loophole to resign . " I hope the investigation will go on just the same . My charges were against not only Connolly but all the other officials who may be implicated , although I did not mention the latter by name . In preferring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who elected me . " Mr. Harvey said he would confer today with his counsel and friends on the resignation and determine what steps could be taken to have the investigation continued in some form .
