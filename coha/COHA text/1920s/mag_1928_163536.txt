In the portraits of the ladies who belonged to that dissolute court managed by Louis XIV of France , there often appears the dark and ambiguous figure of a black dwarf . In an article published by the Messenger , famed Negro periodical , one J. A. Rogers offers a by no means unlikely explanation of the pictorial presence of these creatures . <P> It is a fact that an African potentate presented Queen Maria Theresa , the consort of Louis , with a Negro dwarf . So fond of the monstrous little character did the Queen become , that her ladies too acquired dwarfs . Soon it became a fashion . The affection which these ladies lavished upon their horrible pets was touching and delightful . Maria Theresa , indeed , would often invite her dwarf to sit on her lap . <P> Mr. Rogers says that the Queen of France gave birth to a female pickaninny and that courtiers agreed that the grimaces of her dwarf must have frightened her into what would otherwise have been a most dubious production . The black girl was baptized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed until her death . French records of the period speak of a " black nun . " <P> Mr. Rogers ' conclusion : " The Black Nun* might have been a mystery in those days but in this hardboiled age we are inclined to be a bit more sceptical . " <P> <P> * The Duc de Saint-Simon mentions this tale in his Memoirs .
