txt Representative WiLuAmsoN of South Dakota " gave a talk " in the House last week about " predatory animals . " In a place of interminable vague howlings about " predatory interests " the change of subject must have been welcome . Estimates are easy . Mr. WILLIAINISON calculates , from " such figures as are available , " that his State loses something like $1,000,000 a year in horses , cattle and sheep killed by four-legged bandits . A bobcat is good for $50 a year of damage ; a coyote for $100 , a wolf or mountain lion for $1,000 . Two heroes emerge ; one is incomparable . The Custer wolf was hunted for nine years , though there was a bounty of $500 for his head . He is supposed to have destroyed more than $25,000 worth of live stock , besides gratifying his taste for venison . Yet , according to Inspector KNOWLES of the Biological Survey , he was an . innocent ancl , in. offensive critter compared with Three Toes , the Harding County desperado . This eminent wolf killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill than eat . He began his active career in 1912 . He was not in the full sweep of destruction until about 1917 . His range extended into Southwestern North Dakota and Southeastern Montana , over the region of most of THEODORE ROOSEVELT 'S hunting trips . More than 150 men had pursued him in vain . " He was known to " have destroyed over $50,000 worth of " live stock . " Junior Inspector Bums studied him carefully and trapped him , moribund , last July . Three Toes is thought to have been the last gray wolf in South Dakota . It is lucky that he has n't left his like behind . He was nearly twenty years old . He grew up in a cow country and did n't really , find scope for his deviltry until sheep growing became a great industry . The horses that he made way with are not remembered against him ; and most of the old cattlemen who watched his early raids are gone . He had a peculiar passion for purple stock . Hear Inspector KNOWLES : The sheepmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Three Toes 's specialties was killing in the woven-wire-enclosed pastures maintained at nearly all of the ranch headquarters . The buck herds are kept in these pastures during the Summer months . Three Toes seemed to single out these pastures and systematically kill in them . At the Latha ranch in the Summer of 1922 thirty-four registered Rambouillet bucks were purchased at a cost of $35 each . The wolf . killed all of them in less than a month after their arrival at the ranch . His kill of registered breeding sheep in that Summer alone was valued at $3,465 . The following year his kill at the Lathe , Sletton and Henry sheep ranches alone was valued at $6,700 His total known killing that year was valued at 312,000 worth of sheep and cattle . This was , no doubt , his banner year . It was during this year , while on a trip through Harding County , that he staged the killing of a mulch cow and her calf at the Lathe , ranch on the night I stayed there . The largest kill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty head of range sheep that included some twenty breeding ewes and their lambs , with the balance of the fifty said to have been yearlings that were being kept to add to the breeding band the following season . Three Toes lost two toes of one of his forefeet in a trap while still a freshman in crime . There was no mistaking him . His professional instinct was unconquerable . Once when a hunter was trying to run him down with a relay of fast horses , Three Toes called at a corral and killed fifteen sheep . His delight in slaughter almost makes one believe in werewolves . Already he is a legend . Montana will have it that he was born hers . Bobcats and coyotes are small deer by the side of the last and worst of South Dakotan gray wolves .
