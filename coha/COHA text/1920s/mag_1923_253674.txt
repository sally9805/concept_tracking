Statistics just issued summarize the work of the Air Mail since its inception on May 15 , 1918 , up to December 31 , 1922 . Its record is truly remarkable . Over 5,000,000 miles were flown during this period-the schedule now calling for nearly 2,000,000 miles a year-and 160,473,600 letters were carried at a total cost of $4,295,967 or about two and a half cents a letter . The Post Office pilots fly in all weathers and nearly one third of the total number of 23,077 trips were made in rain , snow , hail or fog . The number of forced landings is always diminishing and the percentage of trips completed during 1922 was 95.22 , while the schedule maintained during the summer months was 100% perfect .
