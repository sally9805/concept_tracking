txt Some of the most terrible fighting of the war was done on the bleak shores and arid plains of the Gallipoli Peninsula . The British and Australasians buried their thousands of dead where they fell , and with the coming of peace the bodies were gathered into cemeteries . A commission , was appointed to provide mainte1 ' lance and perpetual care . On Sept. 13 a British cemetery at Suvla %Bay was dedicated in the presence of armed forces representing Great Britain , the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand . General HARINGTON made the principal address , in the course of which he said : Tire have now the last solemn and beautiful task to perform , to bid farewell to those whom we leave behind on the Gallipoli Peninsula . There is nothing more beautiful than the cemeteries of the peninsula . Nothing can exceed the care bestowed on them by Colonel HUGRES and his assistants of the Imperial War Graves Commission . Their work will live for all time . The cemeteries will , I am confident , always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I hope , of today and tomorrow . In General RAIIINGTON 'S tribute to the work of the British commission there is an assurance that when the survivors of I Gallipoli and their kin visit the peninsula they will find the resting places of their dead reverentially tended . Complaints have been made recently to the United States Graves Registration Service that some of the cemeteries dedicated to the . American dead in France are not beautiful , that the approaches are unsightly , and that the grounds suffer from neglect . Belleau Wood vies with Suvla Bay in its tradition of valor and sacrifice . All that the human ' soul can , dare and the human frame endure was made historic in the taking of Belleau Wood . The achievement is imperishable . Surely the Belleau Wood cemetery should be as tenderly cared for as that of our allies at Suvla Bay .. But a x " port comes from France that Belleau Wood is perhaps of all the American cemeteries the most backward , the least inspiring . The road to . it from the Paris-Rheims highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassable in rainy weather . In the cemetery , which is almost bare of ' grass , no permanent walks have been made , no trees planted . It has been described as looking like " a huge building site cleared for excavation . " Not far away is a cemetery of Italian soldier dead of singular beauty . The contrast is said to , pe , painful.t. . : -.  --  , 1 It may be that the American Graves Registration Service has been embarrassed by lack of available fund.s , but $137,030 was appropriated for the Belleau Wood cemetery . A part of the sum was obtainable on July 1 , 1922 . In the following August little work had been done on the grounds . Execution of the plans was slow . It is now more than five years since the American sacrifice was made , and almost five years since the last shot in the war was fired . There are 2,000 American soldier dead in Belleau Wood .                   @ @
