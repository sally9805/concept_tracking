I N A cave on the desolate summit of Mount Brukkaros , in the heart of a desert waste in southwest Africa , two American scientists soon will begin a most extraordinary vigil . In endless solitude , sixty miles from the nearest town of any size and six miles from the closest Hottentot village , they will spend their waking hours , day after day , with delicate instruments studying the mysteries of the sun . Patiently they will keep at it . For in their strange vigil they will be inspired by the hope of wresting from the face of the sun new secrets of energy and radiation which may be of untold value to future generations . The names of these scientists are William H. Hoover , head of an expedition sent out by the National Geographic Society in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution , and Frederick A. Greely , his assistant . AS YOU read this , they have embarked on a 10,000-mile journey by ship , railway , auto and burro to the mountain island in the desert , which will serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With them is a sixteen-monthsold baby , Mr. Hoover 's daughter . With them also are thirty-five cases containing marvelously delicate astronomical instruments , fifteen cases of photographic plates , a gasoline , engine to generate power for the instruments , a gasoline stove , cooking utensils , books , a phonograph , and a large number of records . All these , in the final stage of their hazardous journey , they must transport over mountain passes called " the most desert spot in a desert . " This dreary observation post was established a few months ago by Dr. Charles G. Abbot , director of the astrophysical laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution , who for more than thirty years has studied the sun and its mysteries . Here the two scientists acting as Dr. Abbot 's outposts will face months of isolation in the wilderness to carry on his attempts to solve for mankind the riddles of the fiery power plant of the sky . For ages men have thought of the sun as an unchangeable giver of warmth and light . But is it actually so dependable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , how do these variations affect our weather and our daily life on earth ? Right now the face of the sun is passing through one of its periodic eruptions of sun spots , which began in 1916 . Just what are these spots , and how do they influence us ? WE KNOW that the sun is a tremendous power plant , generating billions of horsepower every second . Can we ever learn to turn this endless source of power to run our machinery ? And if so , how ? These are a few of the fascinating problems which science seeks to answer . As for the first of the questions , the constancy of the sun , Dr. Abbot already has established the fact that the sun 's radiation does vary from day to day . In his years of experiment he was one of the first scientists to advance the theory that these variations affect our weather . To test his theory , Dr. Abbot established two observatories in the western hemisphere one at Calama , Chile , and the other atop Mt . Harqua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the slight rainfall and the clarity of the atmosphere . Each day the sun 's heat is recorded at both places , and from that the solar constant is figured . This impos- ing term means nothing more than the heat of the sun that would be recorded on a thermometer located outside the great bag of atmosphere that surrounds the earth . The figures from both stations are then telegraphed to Washington . They have been found strikingly alike when compared daily , while the change in the figure from day to day has proved to Dr. Abbot 's satisfaction his theory that the sun 's heat fluctuates . The next thing to determine is how this variation affects the weather . Given that , long range forecasting will be an actuality . BUT first Dr. Abbot wanted a further check on his theory . Possibly the stations ' figures were much the same because they were located so near to each other . He decided to seek a dry spot in the eastern hemisphere . With that end in view he left Washington a year ago for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discarded until he reached Mt . Brukkaros . Men like Dr. Abbot who are making the sun their life study believe that if they can solve the mystery of the sun spots the rest will be easy . Why do these spots vary in numbers ? What is the explanation of the eleven-year cycle of their appearance ? If you take a baseball in your hand , twirl it , and watch the stitching travel in a sort of arc toward the center and then away from it , you will have a fair idea of the motion of the spots across the sun 's face . They first make their appearance at the upper edge , but have no effect on the earth until they reach the central meridian . When they are sixteen degrees north or south of the sun 's equator their effect on us is the greatest . Then they pass out on the other side . But if large enough they may appear again when the sun has completed his round , which takes from twenty-five to thirty days . Many of these spots are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescope , using , of course , smoked glasses or a piece of densely fogged photographic film as protection for the eyes . The large spot observed in January last had been visible on several previous rotations . When it reached its period of greatest intensity it was found to have a diameter of about 40,000 miles . If five worlds the size of ours had been lined along just one half of that crater they could have all been pushed in at one time without touching one another . What causes these tremendous volcanoes ? Scientists would give much to know the answer . It is now pretty generally believed that the sun is made up of a number of layers of gases ? all in motion , but at varying speeds . Dr. J. H. Jeans , the British scientist , believes that these layers rotate faster toward the surface , just the opposite of the action of the earth . The different speed of these lay-ers has the effect of setting up whirlpools or vortices . If you stand on the rear platform of a train you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the partial vacuum caused by the swift passage of the train . In any body of water where there is a swift current , or currents of varying speeds , such as Niagara Gorge or Hell Gate , New York , whirlpools are set . up . The same phenomenon is believed to happen in the sun . BETWEEN each pair of layers an immense vortex is created , extending clear around the circumference . With the increase in friction this whirlpool grows and seeks an outlet . The tremendous energy finally forces openings through the top layer of the sun , in the same way that water whirlpools become waterspouts . Out shoot great volumes of gas which continue to pour forth until-the internal pressure has been relieved . It 's just as Though the sun had occasional stomach aches caused by the formation of gas . When that pressure has subsided to the extent of being less than the weight of the sun 's outside layer , the breach closes up . These spots seem to travel in pairs , one on each side of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite of the other . Here 's the way that is explained : If you draw an oar blade through the water you set up a tiny whirlpool . Close examination will reveal that the direction of the whirl where the oar leaves the water is opposite to that of the point of entry . It 's the same principle exactly in the sun . Follow that great vortex around the circumference from the first break to the other , and you 'll see how the direction of the twist changes . POSSIBLY you and your friends were disappointed with the performance of your radio sets last winter . The transAtlantic tests were a complete failure . All that , the scientists say , is chargeable to the sun spots . It has been known that they affect telegraphic and telephonic communication ? on a day last January operation on almost all long distance lines was virtually suspended for an hour ? but the effect of those solar volcanoes on radio broadcasting was principally a matter of conjecture until last winter . But these dis- turbing periods have their compensations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest curative agents at the disposal of man . The ultraviolet rays are known for their healthgiving properties , and have been found particularly beneficial in the treatment of rickets and tuberculosis . Experiments have revealed that during his periods of activity the sun is unusually generous in his distribution of the ultra-violet rays . DESPITE the distance that separates us from the sun , he ca n't hide many of his secrets from us . We know , for example , just what he is made of . And all of his chemical constituents have been found on earth with the exception of one , coronium , which is revealed during an eclipse . The fact of this duplication gave rise to a theory recently expounded by Professor John A. Snyder , of the Philadelphia Observatory , that the earth is an offshoot of the sun . Away back a few billion years or so the sun , he tells us , was much more active than at present . A great boiling motion is kept up in the interior even now ? the heat at the center is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that in its youth the sun was much hotter and more active . When the earth carne into being , Professor Snyder thinks , there was an eruption similar to that which occurs in many homes daily at breakfast time when the housewife lets the coffee boil over . The sun got beyond its boiling point and a spot , or volcano , formed on its surface . The force was so great that a small portion of the interior shot out and went sailing in a curve through space , muchas the coffee shoots up and over the side of the pot . ON AND on this segment of gas flew , gradually slackening speed and describing a great arc as the normal attraction of the sun worked to offset the force of propulsion . When the particle had reached a distance where the two forces were equal , it lost its motion away from the parent and continued on its curve . Gradually it cooled , formed a crust , and settled down to the task of making itself habitable for humans . Professor Snyder believes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that a hole was torn in the opposite side of the sun 's outer layer . Another segment was tossed out , becoming in time the planet Venus . It really seems a shame to let the sun 's energy go to waste . It is estimated that the amount of heat generated every second has a mechanical equivalent of 20,000 billion horsepower , sufficient to do all the work of the world . If there were only some way in which that energy could be harnessed we should not have to bother digging coal and drilling oil wells . Just snap on a switch and the sun would do the rest . Our knowiedge of this great orb would be much greater were it not for the fact that we have , on the average , only a minute or two a year  | in which to study it carefully . That is during an eclipse . Only then is the corona , an immense halo many thousands of miles in diameter , visible . It was during one of those momentary periods that the existence of helium was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually it was discovered on earth . The corona is irregular in shape . Mountains of leaping light which form the outer edge reach heights of 35,000 miles and more . It is believed these prominences have a direct connection with the sun spots , hence the eagerness with which they are examined . AN ECLIPSE , as you know , results when the moon gets between the earth and the sun . Were it not for a peculiar coincidence in the mathematical scheme of the heavens , eclipses would be of little value to the astronomer , as far as observation of the corona is concerned . The diameter of the sun is 400 times that of the moon , but its distance from the earth is also about 400 times that between earth and moon . The result is that when the moon passes directly across the sun 's face the latter is completely obscured to persons whose location on the earth 's surface is in the resultant shadow . Just try this little experiment , and you 'll see how it works . Your radio cone speaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the sun . Cut a circular disk of cardboard one inch in diameter to represent the moon . Now , assuming that your speaker or plate is eighteen inches in diameter , pace off eighteen feet from it and hold the disk before one eye , closing the other . Extend it slowly in the direction of the speaker until you have reached a point where the edge of the latter begins to appear . If you will have another person measure the distance from your eye to disk you will find it is exactly one foot . THAT experiment represents a total eclipse . There are two other kinds ? annular and partial . If , from the place where you have secured a total eclipse , you move your arm still further out in the direction of the speaker , you will be able to make out the rim . That illustrates an annular eclipse , while a partial eclipse can be demonstrated by moving your hand a little to the right or the left , so that one side of the speaker is visible while the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend months in the erection of great cameras just for a view of an eclipse that may last only a moment or two . Universities and scientific societies spend many thousands of dollars in equipment . It is estimated that the cost of each eclipse expedition is about $10,000 a minute . When it is all over the photographic plates are developed and examined carefully for new signs . If one little bit is thereby added to our knowledge of the sun these investigators feel well repaid for their time and trouble . Meanwhile the sun beams down , seeming to indulge himself in a sardonic smile at the puny efforts of men to discover his source of energy .  |
