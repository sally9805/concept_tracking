Castigator Lewis , Slightly Relieved , Hammers Out a Heroism <P> The Story . By dogged , self-determined ways , pale young Martin Arrowsmith made himself a doctor . What pricked him on from apprenticeship under a toping village sawbones to postgraduate work at the State of Winnemac 's great Sears-Roebuckian university was an itching to learn , to know , to do . <P> At Winnemac , the itch was inflamed to an ache , a passion for pure science and meticulous laboratory research . The purposes of Arrowsmith 's contemporaries were shoddy , sloppy ( there was a beefy Bible-banger , a medical Babbitt , an icy , calculating dollar-chaser ) . And even stronger than Arrowsmith 's reactions against these was his love for the lonely , sardonic genius of the school , Max Gottlieb , Mephistophelian German Jew , brilliant immunologist , pure scientist . <P> Gottlieb , seeing Arrowsmith 's genius , loved him well , worked him cruelly , burned into him technic and skepticism so deeply that the boy was fashioned for his destiny before he met little Leora , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leora Tozer - was a probationer in the Zenith Hospital . She looked up from scrubbing a floor , grinned at self-important young " Dr. " Arrowsmith ; sassed him , understood him , made him her life . She was untidy , not brainy , not pretty . But her genius for living matched Arrowsmith 's capacity for work . <P> Their life was a succession of frustrations . Leora 's effort for a child was abortive . Arrowsmith 's country practice in her home town - Wheatsylvania , N. D. - was satisfying ( despite her puny relatives ) until he indulged in research to cure a cattle-plague gratuitously , and was over cautious concerning a smallpox scare . The research aroused unbearable little professional jealousies . The pox turned out chicken , not small , and left raillery behind it . So again he cleared out , seeking his chance with a very modern , very shrewd private clinic in Chicago . Such clinics deal in fads , however , not in facts . He was sidetracked again - until his research bore fruit in an appointment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gottlieb . <P> Heaven opened . Arrowsmith had every facility , quiet , no interference . He had Gottlieb and one Terry Wickett , just such a lie-hunter as was Arrowsmith . He raced at his work , struck an unknown germ-eater , " Phage , " and paused on the threshold of fame to establish scientific certainty . Came another blow . McGurk Institute , founded to cleanse a grubby name , could not risk loss of publicity . He was ordered to publish his find at once . He refused . A Frenchman found Phage , got the publicity . Arrowsmith was in bad odor at McGurk , even at McGurk , supposedly one of the three strongholds Science had in the land . <P> Still he worked on . Bubonic plague turned up in the West Indies and he headed the McGurk Commission . He would try out his Phage , but insisted that test patients be observed first . More hostility from McGurk , from the colonial government . When he finally had his way , Death , ironic in ghastly buboes , crept in arid throttled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her death unmanned him , his figures went to pot , and the results McGurk published were flagrantly padded .
