Time-the Fourth Dimension of Einstein and Ouspensky ( talented Russian author of Tertium Organum ) is graphically illustrated in the former 's " Relativity " film now exhibited at cinema houses . <P> The picture shows in the simplest manner that things are not always what they seem . What is apparently a sharply bent line may be actually a lead pencil resting in a glass of water , the refraction occurring at the surface of the water where the pencil emerges into a less dense medium , causing it to appear bent . A spot that appears to be white upon a black background is actually gray when seen on a white background . A projectile shot vertically upward from the earth really follows a curved course in space , due to the sidewise motion imparted to it by the rotation of the earth . <P> The film also explains Dr. Einstein 's theory of how light rays from the stars are bent by the magnetic attraction of the sun as they pass it , and the verification of this theory by astronomers during an eclipse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as compared to something else and that the speed of light ( 186,000 miles a second ) is the only standard that never varies , Dr. Einstein introduces time as the fourth dimension , and brings his picture to a whirlwind conclusion by shooting the spectator back through 431 years to 1492 . <P> The onlooker is now back with Columbus discovering America . The 431 years to 1923 A. D. ( which for us are the past ) are for Columbus the the future . Time itself is relative .
