txt Competitive golfin the Chicago dis . tract really gets under way this week with two big days . Memorial day and Saturday . Most of the 138 private clubs hold their official opening on Memorial day ; - Practically every one has an elaborate program arranged for the opening , with half a doien golf The golfer who averages around 100 misses , more or less badly , nearly one-third of the shots he plays . If he there to hit every other shot perfectly , he should score 70 on a par 72 course . Yet he takes - 100 shots , 30 wasted strokes or nearly two on each hole . One of the answers to those two shots wasted on each hole is that despite all the advice against " pressing " In golf , the class C and D golfers try to do too much with each shot , particularly after they played one badly . Let such a golfer top his drive and , regardless of whether or not the ball be laying close , he attempts to slug it with a brassie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , winding up with an eight or worse . Were he to take a spoon or a mid . iron for his second shot , with no hope of making the green , and knock the ball down the fairway he 'd probably have a fairly , easy approach to reach the green in three . And getting on the green in three Is usually eminently satisfactory to the high handicap players ; a string of 5s does n't add up tp 100 . One of the biggest " secrets " of Walter Hagen 's play is that he rarely follows one bad shot with another one . We ignore Bobby Jones because he seldom hits a bad shot , but Hagen hits a lot of poor ones . Unruffled , Hagen plays the next shot . With great mechanical ability , he often counteracts entirely his first bad shot , but if it is impossible he hits his next one with the idea of making the third , shot as easy as possible . Duffers might take that tip . Messrs . Class C and D golfers should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to miss thirty shots in their round and after I each flubbed shot remind themselves " That 's only one of the thirty I 've got coming , " and then refuse to try the " million to one " chance on the next shot but play it according to their abilities .
