After receiving reports from the field this evening Colonel W. E ; Eubanks of the West Virginia National Guard , commander-in-chief of the army of defense , announced ' that the defenders were holding firml ; , , at every point the twenty-five-mile iirrt between Blair Mountain and Crooked Creek .

From " prisoners of war " captured by the defenders on the mountain battle ground during the sharp fighting yesterday and today the military authorities here have received information which to their mind leaves no doubt that the " march on Mingo " was initiated , engineered and financed by local unions in adjacent fields , affiliated with the United Mine Workers of America .

According to all reports that have reached the headquarters of Colonel Eubanks and the stories brought in by fighters returning from the front , the fighting has been heavier today than at any earlier stage of the insurrectionary march on Mixtigo . All the fighting has been on this side of the Boone boundary , line , along a rugged . and heavily wooded mountain ridge , which runs ' in a southeasterly direction - from Mill Creek , about eight miles due north from this city , to Buffalo Creek , about thirty miles to the southeast , and divides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coal rivers . Generally speaking , this nameless ridge up to the present time has formed the boundary between the unionized fields and those not unionized , which are located on this side . Casualties Put at Fifty . Despite ; the heavy fighting that has been in progress during the day , it was said at Colonel Eubanks 's headquarters here that no reports of casualties had been received with the exception of two wounded militiamen who were brought in this morning . What losses have been suffered by the union insurrectos during the sharp conflicts of the last sixteen hours is largely a matter of conjecture . Information brought in from officers , however . place these as high as fifty . Colonel Eubanks tonight declined to either confirm or deny a report that information to that effect had reached headquarters this evening .

Corporal Carroll Dodge of the State Constabulary , returning from this sector during the afternoon , said he had been located there from 9 o'clock last night . . When first reinforcements were rushed to this point , until noon today He said nothing about retreat , but admitted that the defenders . had been hard pressed by A superior force of miner insurrectos .

" With assurance that Federal troops are on the move , some of the tenseness that was so noticeable last night has given way to a sense of comparative security on the part of people here , who weee appalled to learfi this morning that during the night hours a group of miners had been intercepted and driven back at a point back of Guyan Mountain within two miles of the city .

Only a narrow- lane , is left in the Middle of the - thoroughfares for one-way traffic .
