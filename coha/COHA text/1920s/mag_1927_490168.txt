WHEN we read last week that a brave little band of pioneers had walked off a Long Island RailrOad train without paying its fares , we were moved by a feeling of admiration entirely apart from the issue involved in the case . Train rides have always been spoiled for us , because when we are not feverishly searching for our ticket , we are hunting excitedly for the little check the conductor gives out when he takes up the ticket . Thus we are never comfortable and at ease , always feeling that if we lost one or the other we would he harshly dealt with by the authorities at the first stop . We sigh pensively that we have missed our great opportunity . Backed by the support of our fellow travellers , we , too , might have been one of that bold group which , the Times reported , " met the conductor 's ' Tickets , please ' with a cohl look . " This was , it seems to us , perhaps the greatest feat of daring in a year notable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on personal liberty is to us merely a figure of speech . Simple though our wants be , our pursuit of happiness recently has suffered two reverses . The first was when wetried to inspect an excavation on Fifth Avenue , only to find it completely boarded up at eye-level -- padlocked from the public gaze . The second was when we dozed off in the Roxy , only to be awakened by an usher and told we must n't . True , we had never been awakened with such mellifluous solicitude  --  hut we were awakened ! There is no happiness . THE rush for de-nicotinized ciga-rettes continues , much to our bronchial amazement . Mayor Walker smokes them , and so do other people . LVell , this is a dismal and a perverse people , whose tastes can be accounted for neither by science nor imagination . It would be just like this antic town to start a fad for a speakeasy which sold de-alcoholized highballs . MUCH given to the study of architectural forms , we have long been aware that the Paramount Building reminds one of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is seen to derive definitely from some source ; and for the life of us we 've never known what . However , we saw it the other evening shrouded in a fine mist which blurred all but the outline , and the matter was cleared up instantly . It looks for all the world like a trained seal balancing a ball on its nose . So help us . FOR a long time we have patiently observed the tearing up of main thoroughfares in the city . Even when a sidewalk on Park Avenue was con-verted into a lane for automobiles , we remembered in our tolerant and thoughtful way that it was all for the purpose of relieving traffic . Then we observed that Madison Avenue , one of the few places left for automobilists in midtown to detour to , was also set upon by the contractors . This seemed at first an unkind practical joke upon the public , peaceably trying to get about as best it could . We think , however , we have found the high-minded purpose behind it all . Obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into , or hide behind , when the police open fire in crowded streets . This is an ingenious way of curtailing the high rate of casualties among innocent bystanders in the past few weeks . The Police Commissioner is deserving of praise for his resourcefulness , after all other devices had failed him . Sanctuary A JUNIOR executive downtown / I has been unusually rushed during recent months , not only because of the extra burden of colleagues on vacation , but because his wife has kept their Long Island home filled with house guests . Friends noted that he looked careworn and nervous ; it was even whispered that he was acting queerly . A solicitous co-worker accordingly decided to keep an eye on the young man . During the course of this period of friendly interest the self-appointed guardian was apprised one 16 SEPTEMDER 24 1927 day by the gentleman 's wife that he had taken to staying overnight in the city . Now the anxious friend knew that he had been leaving early rather than working late and therefore one evening he trailed the gentleman . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather dingy house in Greenwich Village . As his quarry was about to open the door , the friend went up and laid a hand on his shoulder . " What , " he asked gently , " are you doing down here , Torn " The young executive scowled . " I 'm finishing a book , if you must know , " he said . " Why , I did n't know you were writing a hook ! " exclaimed the other . The harried gentleman turned upon him and said grimly , " I 'm not . I 'm reading one . " Change THE old van Beuren place on West Fourteenth Street , where a toothless old woman and some pigeons have lived for nearly a quarter-century behind a high fence , is coming down at last . Relic of an important family , it has slowly gone to seed in the midst of the busy district , right across from Hearn 's . Hearing that it is finally to be demolished to make way for an office building , we went down there for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm belonging to John Smith . Even before that it was virgin land owned by Elias and Leah Brevoort . You got to the original farmhouse ( razed seventy-five years ago ) down a lonely lane off a road then called King 's Highway . The first homestead was built in 1762 on a twenty-two acre farm . Today the farm is still intact , for , save where streets have been cut through , the whole belongs to the van Beuren estate . It is worth twelve million dollars . John Smith paid the Brevoorts nine hundred and fifty British pounds for it . We got to the house through a hole in the fence on the Fifteenth Streetside . From the rear , it is a dingy , old brownstone skeleton windows bro-ken , shutters hanging , dirt and mold everywhere . The old woman caretaker refused admittance . " No one ever comes in , " she said . No one , it seems , has entered since 1904 when the late Frederick van Beuren , last of the family to live there , moved away . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house taken away . The house and the farm site are now the property of the children of this last resident , who died a year ago . One of these is Dr. Frederick T. van Beuren , the surgeon . Magnificent in ruin , the house has been allowed to stand because of sentimental feelings for the old homestead , we gather . The doors and stairways arc of rosewood . Some of the old rosewood and Chippendale furniture remains ; most of it has been taken away by the family . There are , we were told , secret closets in the walls , entered through the floors of clothes closets above . Here the earlier van Beurens kept their valuables when banks were none too many and not too safe . In the old cellar were fine Jamaica rum and twinkling liqueurs and wines . Distinguished Americans of Colonial times were guests in the first house . Distinguished Americans of Civil War days were guests in the present house . Henry Spingler bought the farm from John Smith one hundred and forty years ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael van Beuren . The Michael van Beurens lived in the house until 1880 , with their children . Then the son , Frederick , took it over . An ancient stable stands behind the house . It was there when Spingler bought the farm . The farmhouse was too lonely for him and he built one called the House on the Hill , facing on a main highway . That came down to make way for Union Square . Shortly many streets were cut through and there was nevermore a question of loneliness . Persistence ASTILL further instance of liquor selling by fake steamship stewards is reported by a gentleman who was disturbed by numerous telephone calls following his return from Europe on a French Line boat . He was called out of bed at 8 A.M. by the cabin steward , called out an hour later by the bath steward , called as he was shaving by another steward , and rung up at his office by the bar steward , all in the first morning . In each instance the gentleman answered the salesman in French , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them seemed to have been born and raised in New Jersey . Work and Play A YOUNG matron who went in-nocently to a neighbor 's home at Lake Placid last summer to play bridge and found that one of the four-some was Work , has provided us with a glimpse of the master at his game . Although bridge is his livelihood , it also , apparently , is his recreation . He seemed to enjoy playing . While the stakes were but a cent a point his in-terest was as deep as if they had been twenty to thirty cents a point , a rate at which the expert frequently plays with the more adroit at the game . He plays slowly . as slowly as a conscientious beginner , apparently to avoid all possibility of a mistake . No slip was noted in his play during the evening . The game is a serious matter to him . He originated no side conversation nor joined in any . His attitude towards Mrs. Work , who played also , was about that of the average husband toward his wife in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the playing of the others was concerned , however , he offered no comment . He seemed , in fact , reluctant to make any observations . If asked outright whether a hand had been played correctly , he would answer very briefly . If it had been , he would say merely yes , and nothing more . If there had been an error he would point it out but he was not inclined to discuss it further . They played auction Work , it is surmised , prefers it to contract . Several times during the evening he was interrupted by a secretary ? with a telegram asking the expert to decide some technical question . One was from Kansas . During his vacation at Lake Placid he spent several hours a day answering such telegrams and letters . He was accompanied by two secretaries whom he kept busy . We are told that Work has abandoned his bridge classes in favor of lecturing to large audiences , that 250,000 copies of his book on contract have been sold and that this winter he will introduce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expects will prove highly popular . Response Fr HERE is in town  --  in case you I do not know it an organization philanthropically run , known as the National Desertion Bureau . Its purpose is to restore to Wives , in one way or another , spouses who have fled from ? 18 SEPTEMDER 2 4 , 19 27 them . We have to report the recent failure of the organization in a case upon which it had expended much extra effort . The bureau had sent many letters to the absconding husband , at first cajoling and then exhorting . It was felt certain that the deserter , ere long , would succumb to the call of duty and the adroit appeals to sentiment and romance , and return . To their joy they one day received a letter from the gentleman , addressed to his wife . She was called to the office and the missive was opened with high hopes . The message to the loved one was brief : " Ha ha ha ha ha I 'm in Canada . " Cold Dawn ONE afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we knew as something of a manabout-town . He was carrying a book and there was dejection in his manner . He told us of his sorrow . The night before he had attended / a party at the apartment of a fellow bachelor , and in the glow of high spirits had grown warmly confidential with a show girl . Discussing the deeper aspects of life , she had told him that , although in the chorus , she was really interested in books and the serious things . " Well , " said the pilgrim , " when I regained consciousness this morning I slowly realized that I had made a date to go over and read a book to her this afternoon . " He showed us the volume he had chosen . It was " Vanity Fair , " by William Makepeace Thackeray . Riders AGENTLEMAN who seldom misses a Sunday morning on the bridle path in Central Park has identified for us the riders most often seen about . Riding in the park , of course , no longer means what it once did socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't what they used to he . Several members of the Early Risers , a club famous in the heyday of riding , are still to be seen about . These include Mr. Jefferson Seligman , Mr. James W. Gerard , Judge Joseph M. Proskauer , Mr. Edward van der Horst Koch , and Dr. Mackenty , who , we are told , often goes straight from his early morning ride to the hospital and performs operations before breakfast . The dean of the Central Parkers seems to be Mr. William E. Iselin , the importer , who is seventy-nine . Mr. Charles R. Flint , who is seventy-seven , is another familiar elder . William M. Chadbourne , lawyer and Chevalier of the Legion of Honor , is a picturesque rider often seen about . ? ? ? ? Will Rogers keeps a string of polo ponies here and rides when in town . He always wears a cap . Mr. Jesse Winburn , Omega Oil maker , and Samuel Rosoff , subway builder and hard rider , are ardent horsemen . Several women riders are regularly to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Crouch , president of the Mallet and Bridle Club , Mrs. Walter R. Hanley , Mrs. Kingdon Gould , and Mrs. John Purroy Mitchel . Lady McKetchnie is an Englishwoman whose mounts are familiar . Miss Frieda Hempel rides often and is an excellent horsewoman . The younger generation is represented by Miss Katherine Condit , Miss de Pinna , Miss Barbara Guggenheim , Miss Doris Hofheimer and Mrs. Mildred Bedell Quinn . The Early Risers used to take to the park paths at dawn . Races were run to a point now replaced by a row of apartments . The winner got a bottle of wine . That was in the days of the famous dinner on horseback given in Sherry 's by the late C. K. G. Billings . Now , in place of six o'clock breakfasts , one riding group has Sunday breakfast at the Plaza at one o'clock in the afternoon . It might not be amiss here to make mention of Mayor Walker 's horse . This mount and rider , we understand , have never been seen in the park . The horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in a stable in West Sixty-seventh Street . It was a gift to the mayor from Mr. I. Altman ( who himself an enthusiastic horseman ) . is Cedar King and it is a dark chestnut with a blaze face and two white feet . Mayor Walker , they say , has never ridden it , but frequently , when in that part of town , stops in and feeds it sugar . The mayor once generously offered , at a banquet in his honor , the use of the Armory in Central Park as a clubhouse for the Central Park Riding Club . The next day , however , the members  --  and the mayor  --  found out from Mr. Gallatin , then park commissioner , that the mayor could n't give armories away . The Central Park Riding Club ( now the Columbia ) needed quarters because it lost those in Durland 's Academy when the group known as the Riding Club bought that place . The Columbia Club is now building new quarters . Meanwhile it is sharing Durland 's . Quandary AFRIEND reports that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when several brisk and stern gentlemen entered and , announcing that they came in the name of the law , took charge of the place and searched in During the excitement the proprietor , impressively cool through it all , slipped from table to table reassuring his guests . " Do n't worry , " he told them . " Just sit where you are , and if they ask you your name say it 's Smith . " The trouble with this advice , in our friend 's case , was that his name is Smith . Agreement AN automobile owner of our acquaintance reports that it is quite easy to avoid a ticket for all night parking , if one selects the proper type of car . This gentleman has a comfortable , well-upholstered THE NEW YORKER 19 sedan , which he often leaves standing before his home all night . Very early one morning he found the policeman on the beat asleep on the back seat . The arrangement has been continued , we learn , with the understanding that the policeman shall remove his shoes to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report the matter to the proper authorities . Royalty THE recent presence about town of the Maharajah of Rutlam has stirred in us memories of a distinguished visitor of a similar type . There can be no harm in recalling the story of the two young Americans who took precedence over all foreign ambassadors at the wedding of the Gaekwar of Baroda . It may be that there are elements of a fable in the tale , but the gentleman who told it to is assures us that it 's all true . The Gaekwar in question was the one who so amused and entertained the Harvard campus when he arrived there in I911 , bearing to President Lowell a letter from his father asking the honored sir to decide whether one thousand pounds a month would be sufficient pocket money to allot the bearer , his son . Two of his classmates , beating their way about the world , after graduation , came to Calcutta , Let us , they said , inspired , visit " The Gyke " . So they telegraphed and by return wire were bidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip , they climbed wearily down to the platform into the outskirts of a great commotion . A regiment of cavalry was drawn up opposite the depot ; at the far end of the train was a buzzing of excitement ; everywhere a scurrying of officials . " What , " they asked a train guard , " is all this about ? " " The train you ride in has been honored , sirs . For do you not know that the young Gaekwar of Baroda is celebrating his marriage , and two ambassadors have come from his University in the United States . They telegraphed from Calcutta and are expected on this train . " The true identity of these " ainbassadors " finally percolating , the two youths scrambled through the train , ran up the other side and re-emerged in the midst of the excitement , to fall in the arms of the dear old Gyke . Their corning was understandable to him . Everyone else had sent ambassadors , why not Harvard ? From then on the tale becomes idyllic . They rode at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms about them as he explained that their wire had been delayed so that he had not had time to reserve a suite for them in the palace . The substitute proved an acre or so of oriental tenting , hung with tapestry , deeply carpeted . An English butler met them at its portals . Among other and luxurious furnishings was a magnificent mahogany bar ( private ) , completely equipped . Each evening they retired to tinkling music of their own orchestra , after idly watching the swirling graces of their own troupe of dancing girls . The ceremonies lasted a week . Furor resulted when , in one of the most resplendent of wedding parades , the carriage of the Americans was placed , by the Gaekwar , before the carriage of the highest emissary of Great Britain . To ride ahead of the Englishman violated all sorts of diplomatic etiquette . Yet the British Government could find no legitimate excuse for taking exception to what was obviously a sly gesture of the Indian ruler , for , as was pointed out to the infuriated diplomatic personage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college chums " of the most high son of the Gaekwar of Baroda . Assist NEW YORK- the resection is evoked by art incident of last week  --  is not a neighborly city , but we are a cooperative , disciplined lot . A young lady who has moved to the twelfth floor of one of the new apartment buildings on upper Fifth Avenue was moved to write a letter at midnight . She was in her nightie and , having finished the missive , shuddered at the idea either of dressing and going out to mail it or of calling an attendant . Being resourceful , she merely dropped it out of the window . A few days later she received an answer , proving that the letter had promptly reached its destination .
