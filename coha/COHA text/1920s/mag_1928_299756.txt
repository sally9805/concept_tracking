A batch of small balloons was the most important baggage of three young Naval officers aboard the Shipping Board liner America when she left Manhattan for Cherbourg last week . All the journey across the Atlantic , and back to Manhattan , the young men are to blow up the balloons with gas and watch them float and bob away to the limit of their tethers . While aloft the balloons will indicate upper air currents . When they are pulled back to the America 's deck , self-registering thermometers on some will show upper air temperature variation . All the observations will provide facts for theses on hitherto incompletely known ocean aerology , which the three lieutenants will complete this autumn at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
