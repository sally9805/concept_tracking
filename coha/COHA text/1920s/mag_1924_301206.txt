An apparently exhausted oil field may be " rejuvenated " by a new water-flooding process which has been demonstrated practically in the fields of Bradford , McKeesport and Murraysville , Pa . In time the wells may refill and produce several times the quantity originally furnished . At Houston , Tex. , the process was described by Roswell H. Johnson , well-known eugenist and professor of oil and gas production in the University of Pittsburgh , at the annual meeting of the American Association of Petroleum Engineers . The water is let into an old well ; it spreads out through the saturated oil sands and shales , driving the oil ahead to other wells . Air and gas have been used for similar purposes . Even after a well has been retapped by this method , oil frequently remains in the finer sands , and may , after 20 years more , distribute itself through the area again . The petroleum resources of Pennsylvania amount to over 400 million barrels , though only 35 million barrels have been removed . By these recovery methods , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Johnson is not an uncritical optimist , however ; he believes we should in no way weaken the drive for conservation of these essential resources .
