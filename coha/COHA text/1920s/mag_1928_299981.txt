Nicholas Constantinovich Roerich nursed his chilblains . Jailbirds were glad , and school children , teachers , art students , functionaries at his Roerich Museum in Manhattan . They were glad because at last he was safe and recuperating from his five-year expedition in and around Tibet , in snow and desert . Where other expeditions dig and collect for science , he saw and painted for art . Snug with him at Darjeeling in northeast India last week were bales of his paintings . He has depicted the whole panorama of Tibet , scenery , people , customs . Some of his scenes are realistic ; most are interpretative . A philosopher-painter , he prefers to translate a situation as he realizes it . Soon he will take his pictures to the U. S. for display first in his museum , then in jails and school houses for the benefit of the crass as well as of the well-bred . Many to know what he is trying to say with paintings will need the aid of the scientific notes that he made incidentally on his trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' son , was well . Brilliant young Orientalist , he studied there . Perfect in more than a score of Asiatic dialects , on this expedition he was his father 's facile interpreter and pacifier of obstreperous brigands . He is a painter , too . His brother Sviatoslav is a portraitist . Sviatoslav has just reached Darjeeling from the U. S. <P> Women were glad : Mrs. Nicholas Roerich , mother and wife of the men , had had the stamina to accompany them through five years of privation . Last week at Darjeeling she was still weak from starvation , long marches , high climbing , winters in thin tents . Two other women had endured with her . <P> Archaeologists were glad : In the Altai Mountains , along northern Tibet , Dr. Roerich found tombs like those of Ancient Goths in eastern Europe . Buckles ornamented with Goth-like double eagles strengthened his theory . Tibetans told him that anciently the country around Lhasa was called Gotha . <P> Scientists were glad : Roerich notebooks were crammed with important observations-magnetic , meteorological , geological , topical botanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roerichs found a Buddhism twisted topsy-turvy , the black faith of Bon Po . They worship demons , hate Buddhists , have their peculiar saints with a central , legendary protector similar to Buddha . The swastika is one of their symbols . <P> Swedes were glad : The Roerichs descend from Swedes who a thousand years ago founded the Russian empire . <P> Russians were glad : The Roerichs were born there . Nicholas Roerich 's father , important St. Petersburg attorney , insisted that his son study the law . The son wanted to study art . He studied both simultaneously and never practiced law . His first paintings were realistic and ordinary , yet showed that flashy brilliance that many Russians have when they are young and conceited . He spent a year in Paris and turned impressionist . Fantastic flat decorations are his forte and peculiarity . In this manner he has tried to picture Russia 's and Asia 's past . His pieces number about 3,000 . Several hundred are in the Roerich Museum in Manhattan . They are wierd , mystical , fascinating .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
