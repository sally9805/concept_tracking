Debate of Premier Benito Mussolini 's bill to reform the electoral law ( TIME , Dec. 29 ) provided abundant scope for the fiery oratory and violent scenes which have made the Italian Chamber of Deputies so justly famed . <P> The beginning of the debate was enlivened by the re-entry into the Chamber of the Communists , who decided to abandon their boycott in order to be able to heckle the Government . Their spokesman , Signor Grieco , was not long in starting his attack . In a bitter speech , full of the usual Communist phrases , he attacked Fascism mercilessly for its policies , its achievements , its existence . <P> At the end of the oration the Communists sang The Red Flag . It was the first time that it had been heard in the Italian Parliament for two years . Something had to be done about it , so the Fascisti mocked the Communists by joining in with them as they bellowed The Red Flag . <P> After this friendly action the Communists were so overcome that they left the Chamber in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving them good-by with their handkerchiefs . Deputy Farenacchi , leader of the Savage or Extremist Fascisti , advanced toward them with the mock politeness of a host " speeding his departing guests " : " Come again , often , " said he . " We are always pleased to see you . " <P> The next day a furious debate took place on the electoral bill . The oratory was , however , meaningless , for the Fascist Party holds two-thirds of the Chamber 's seats and is opposed only by a handful of the Opposition , owing to the boycott declared by the Socialists who number 150 or two-thirds of the Opposition . <P> Ex-Premier Orlando opened the debate for the Opposition . Amid frequent and angry interruptions he criticised adversely the Premier 's recent iron-hand policy ( TIME , Jan. 19 ) , and for the rest contented himself with expatiating upon the contents of the withdrawn motion . <P> Ex-Premier Giolitti spoke , but had little to add to Signor Orlando 's arguments . His reception from the Fascisti was more violent than that accorded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signor Giolitti is a past master in the gentle art of " cooking " elections . <P> The aged ex-Premier ( 83 ) declared that he had little hope that the bill would be defeated . <P> " You ought to be pleased . It will give you another reason to oppose me , " teased Mussolini . <P> Signor Giolitti went on to say that honest elections were impossible at the present stage of the internal situation . <P> " You could give me lessons on how to run an election , " came the meaning retort from the Premier . And , later , in answer to another jibe from Giolitti , Signor Mussolini rapped out : " You may rest assured we will not use the artillery in our election . You have done even that . " <P> Final debate on the bill passed off without untoward incident . On a motion supported by several Fascist Deputies representing workmen , a provision for plural voting for certain classes of men was deleted . The objection to this section of the bill was that its effect would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill was passed by 268 to 19 votes .
