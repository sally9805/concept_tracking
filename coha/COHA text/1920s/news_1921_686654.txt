txt Declaration of a regular dividend nowadays is something in the nature of a gratifying surprise . Stockholders of International Mercantile Marine preferred may well have been prepared to forego the semi-annual dividend , declared on Friday . Ocean freights are disheartening and the outlook uncertain . The company 's estimated net earnings in 1920 were a little over $17,000:000 , as against nearly $24,600,000 for the previous year . Five days before the dividend was declared President P. A. S. Franklin said : " The net earnings of our properties for the first half of the year 1921 have been running considerably lower-than the figures given above for 1920 , due to the great shrinkage in the movement of traffic all over the world , resulting in many idle freight steamers and much of the freight moving being carried at rates which in many cases do not pay the cost of labor and other charges incidental to handling the traffic , to and from the steamers . " In addition to this , the movement of third-class passengers from Europe to this country has been.mateHally disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u law in May of this year limiting the immigration from each nation to three per cent . ( 2% ) of the residents of such nation in this country , as shown by the 1920 census . However , the first and second-class passenger business , in which your company is very largely in- terested , is quite satisfactory . " A dividend declaration in the face of such conditions must have had a tangible something to warrant it . The key is found in the last sentence quoted above . First and second-class passengers are truly " paying the freight " . Travelers on the big liners may not like it , but they are paying the dividends . Adjustments had to be made somewhere , and there seems to be an unabated demand for ocean trips no matter how high the fare goes . It is understood that an analysis of the first and second-class business done on I. M. M. steamers in the past six months amply justified the company in maintaining its dividend . This in spite of labor troubles , which seem never to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind all this is the reassuring fact that the company 's ships and other property are well maintained and its cash position strong . Contrast this performance under private awnership with the terrifying record of the United States Shipping Board .
