txt THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK EARS. - The ears can hardly be too small if carried properly . If too small they are apt to be thrown quite erect or prick-eared ; and if large they either can not be properly lifted off the head or , if lifted , they show out of proportion . When in repose the ears are folded lengthwise and thrown back into the frill ; on the alert they are thrown up and drawn closer together on the top of the skull . They should be carried about three-quarters erect . A prickeared dog should be penalized . So much attention having of late been given to securing very high carriage of ears , it has resulted in reaching the other extreme in some cases , and it is now necessary to guard against that .

It is not a fixed point as in color , weight , or height , and is something the uninitiated can only properly understand by optical illustration . It is the combined product of the shape of the skull and muzzle , the set , size , shape , and color of the eyes , and the position and carriage of the ears . GENERAL CHARACTER. ?

THE SMOOTH-COATED COLLIE The Smooth-coated Collie is or should be an exact replica of his rough-coated brother in every detail and particular , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth to the eye , but which is harsh and weather-resisting . The Smoothcoated Collie is an English edition of his Scotch cousin , and is doubtless a manufactured variety to a great extent , as seen to-day on the show bench , although a form of smooth Collie or Sheep Dog has been indigenous to the agricultural districts of England from time immemorial almost . The smooth Collie , as an all-around utility dog , probably can not be excelled . His short , sleek , dense , weather-resisting coat is undoubtedly an advantage to him over his rough brother in snowy // weather , and is less cumbersome to carry . He is more difficult to breed to type because of his smooth coat , which lays bare an anatomy which a rough coat covers , and without which defects of body can not be hidden in the smooth variety . The orthodox color of the smooth is much the same as in the rough-coated variety . There also exists in Scotland a type known as the Bearded Collie . These dogs bear considerable resemblance to the old English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that the latter would assume the form and appearance of Bearded Collies if for a few generations they were bred for working purposes alone . The Bearded Collie is a hardy-looking dog with a very nice temper . They are capable of a good day 's work and can endure much cold and wet without discomfort . The head of a Bearded Collie has something about it which suggests the Dandie Dinmont , while they possess a dignity and grandeur which reminds one of the Deerhound , the Otterhound , and the majestic animals which inhabit mountainous countries . THE GERMAN SHEPHERD DOG The interest in this remarkable breed of dogs has developed so rapidly that we are gratified at being able to present this authoritative article by Jay Hall , one of the most successful exhibitors of the breed in this country : This native German breed resembling the wolf in general appearance is known throughout the world // by many different names . Commonly called the Police Dog , by reason of the large number used in night patrol duty on the police force of German cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is often referred to as the Belgian Police Dog and as the French Police Dog . In America , prior to the entrance by the United States into the World War , it was known by its true name  --  the German Shepherd Dog . In 1918 the American Kennel Club arbitrarily dropped the word " German , " naming the breed plainly " The Shepherd Dog . " The breed is known in Germany as the Deutscher Schaferhiind ( or German Shepherd Dog ) , but when trained for police duty is designated as the Policeihund or police dog . It has been stated that as early as 1911 more than 400 police stations in Germany had been provided with specially-trained dogs of this species . Primarily a herding dog descended from the longhaired dogs of South Germany , he lends himself to training of varied character . A nose hunter , keen of scent , he makes an admirable trailer of man or game . In common with the Shepherd Dog of any race , he , by reason of his close and constant companionship with man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapts him to tireless sustained effort , and the breeders responsible for the fixed type that exists wisely provided for a combination that , while it preserves a certain beauty of outline , has lost nothing in usefulness as // a working dog . The Shepherd has been found readily adapted to training both for Red Cross and police purposes , and has been used extensively in these fields chiefly by the Germans . In Germany the breed is sponsored by the German Shepherd Dog Club , an active organization with a membership of many thousands widely spread throughout the country . The Stud Book published by this . club is a model of excellence . In fact , personally I have never seen a stud book of any breed of animals that was superior to it . It was founded in 1899 . Six root stocks mark the beginning of the breed . No breed of dog has gained favor more quickly with the public than has this breed in America . From obscurity in 1904 , when the breed was first introduced into the United States , to-day ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , three in number at nearly all our more important shows . Perhaps the greatest misnomer , on the part of the uninformed public , of the true and natural disposition of dogs of this breed is a natural result of the commonly given name " Police Dog . " By nature the Shepherd is quick , affectionate , intelligent , faithful , of fine mind and memory , devoted to its master , and zealous in his interest . It is these very attributes that constitute a fine groundwork for the training of certain of these dogs for police service . It is well then to consider that the true dog of the breed is a shepherd by type , and that only specialized // training transforms him to a police dog . As a police dog his fine basic characteristics are accentuated and developed to a point of usefulness for the particular work at hand . The idea of using dogs for civic protection is by no means new . Louis XI , who ruled in France early in the fifteenth century , provided the famous town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malo , close by , was protected in a similar manner . While it is generally recorded that the city of Ghent in Belgium was the first city to establish a systematic and regular school for the training of police dogs and putting them into local service after training them , it is claimed that the honor of introducing the modern police dog on the continent really belongs to Dr. Gerland , who introduced the practice at Hildesheim , Germany , early in 1896 . During the five years that followed the experiment was taken up by practically every country in Europe , and several foreign countries , including Japan , sent representatives abroad to investigate the plan and methods . In the training and instruction of these dogs for police duty they are taught to seize an object without seriously hurting it ; to hunt for vagabonds and defend the uniforms ; not to accept anything from strangers nor to be petted by them ; to guard an object placed on the ground ; to keep individuals at bay without biting until human help arrives , but to attack if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house where dwellings or buildings re- // quire searching ; not to be afraid of firearms ; to run into alleys , behind houses and outbuildings , and into many places where the human eye could not see unless provided with a light ; to follow his master with or without leash at distances ranging to a maximum of ' so feet ; to bark loudly to announce a find . These dogs are finally trained to respect and protect a police uniform , and seem instinctively to know the uniform . If a man attacks its master , the dog becomes furious and savage , and often jumps at the throat of the aggressor . After their training is completed and when they are not on active duty they remain in their kennels all day , seeing only the trainers who care for them , and as they are on duty throughout the night , they have no means of becoming familiar with the public . The first essential of training this breed is to inculcate absolute obedience . It has been found that the greater the intelligence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . The dog 's own individuality is likely to assert itself . Rare discretion must be used by the skilled trainer . The following essentials are enumerated as necessary in their training for police use : A dog must be taught to give tongue when quarry is found or breaks from cover on a run , to curb its hunting instincts and stop abruptly at cry or whistle of command . Where resistance is offered it is taught to leap at the wrist or throat of the culprit , and while prowling by itself to rout from bushes or shadows all marauders . // The dog 's early education for police service leads him to suspect all strangers . He can not be intimidated , coaxed , or lured . He will refuse all food when offered by strangers , even though he may be extremely hungry . A properly trained police dog is irreproachable in morals , mien , and manners . He will face pistol fire unflinchingly and leap savagely to attack . A well-trained dog will easily clear a seven-foot obstacle , and can broad jump a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog 's education enables him to ferret out hidden goods , to find coins that have been dropped ; in fact , to search out every clue of the criminal that may be of service in leading to his eventual discovery and arrest . These dogs are quick to sense the presence of criminals with whom they have had previous contact , and have been known to pick men out of a crowd under these conditions . We would again forcefully call to the reader 's attention the fact that these characteristics are peculiar to those of the breed trained for this special duty or purpose . The well-bred Shepherd untrained for police use is an admirable companion , loyal , affectionate , well mannered , obedient and in no way savage or solitary . The illustration reproduced is that of the Grand Champion of the Breed in America , 1920 , Grand Champion Van Halls Rex Buckel . Listed below is the standard of the breed as established by the German Shepherd Dog Club ( S. V. Munick , E. V. ) in alliance with Specialty Clubs // maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeders ' associations of working dog breeds and also the Alliance with ( P. H. Z. ) ( Police dog breeding ) . Translated from the German by Leo F. F. Wanner , of Hempstead , L. I. GENERAL APPEARANCE. - The German Shepherd is a medium-size dog . He is rather long in body , strong , and well muscled . He is so full of life that when at attention nothing can escape his sharp senses . The average height for dogs is 6o centimeters ( 24 inches ) , and for bitches between S5 and 58 centimeters ( 22 to 2312 inches ) . The height is to be established with a standard laid alongside of the elbow and taken in a straight line from the top of shoulder blade to the ground ; coat parted and pressed down so that the measurement will show only the actual height of the bone frame or structure of the dog . For the Shepherd Dog as a working dog the most desirable height is between 55 and about 64-65 centimeters ( 22 and about 26 inches ) . The working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The traits and special characteristics are watchfulness , courageous loyalty , strict honesty and aristocratic appearance , all forming a combination which makes the clean-bred German Shepherd an ideal companion and watch dog . It is desirable to try to improve his appearance , but nothing must be done which will in any way detract from his usefulness . HEAD. ? Size of head should be in proportion to the // body , not plump ; in appearance clean cut , medium wide between ears . Forehead seen from the front only very moderately arched , without or with only slightly indicated center furrow . Cheeks form a very slight curve to muzzle , without any prominence whatsoever at the front . The skull slopes in a slanting line without any abrupt stop at the forehead , continuing into a cone-shaped , pointed , long , and dry muzzle . The muzzle is strong , the lips dry and tight , firmly fitting together ; the bridge of the nose straight , very nearly following out the elongated line of the forehead . Jaws and teeth are very strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , but they must not be over or undershot . EARS. ? Medium size , set high on the head , broad at the base and pointed at the tips . They are carried erect and turned to the front . Occasionally we find Collie or soft-eared dogs , but the erect ear is always desirable . The breeding of dogs with erect ears is desirable , although it is immaterial how a herding dog carries his ears . Trimmed and soft ears are to be discarded . Puppies and young dogs usually do not straighten their ears before the fourth or sixth month and sometimes even later . EYES. ? Medium size , almond-shaped , set a little obliquely and not protruding ; color as dark as possible . The expression should be lively , intelligent , and show distrust of strangers . NECK. ? Strong , with well-developed muscles of // medium length , without any loose folds of skin . Carried high when excited , otherwise straight . BODY. ? Chest deep , but not too broad . Ribs flat . Stomach moderately tucked up . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should exceed the shoulder height of the dog . Short-coupled and long-legged dogs should be discarded . The Shepherd Dog should never run wild . The handiness and elasticity required of a herding dog is attained by good angles at hindquarters , broad , powerful loin , long , sloping croup . " TAIL. ? Heavily coated , reaching the hock , and often forming a slight hook twisted to one side . At rest the tail hangs in a slight curve . When excited and in motion the curve is accentuated and the tail is raised , although it should never be lifted beyond a vertical line . The tail therefore should never be laid over the back , either straight or curled . It is natural that bob-tails should appear , but they should not be used for breeding . Docked tails are to be discarded . FOREQUARTERS. ? Shoulders long and sloping , well muscled , and set on flat against the body . Legs straight viewed from every angle . HINDQUARTERS. ? Leg broad , powerfully muscled ; upper thigh quite long and viewed from the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hock strong . FEET. ? Round , short , compact , and arched . Pads very hard , nails short , strong , and generally dark in color . Dewclaws usually appear on the hind leg . // Dewclaws are not faults nor are they desirable points in the standard . They generally cause a spread action behind , also injuries , and therefore it is essential that they be removed immediately after the puppies are whelped . CoLox. ? Black , iron-gray , ash-gray , reddish-yellow , reddish-brown ( either solid color or with regular markings of reddish-brown to whitish-gray ) . Furthermore pure white , or white with dark patches intermingled ( blue-red brindle ) , also dark brindle ( black patches on gray , yellow , or light brown body ) , with lighter colored markings . The socalled wolf 's color ( coloring of the dog in his wild state ) , white markings on chest and legs are permitted . The undercoat , except in black dogs , is always light in color . The color of a puppy can only be ascertained after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are classified solely according to the texture of their coats : A. ? The Smooth-Coated German Shepherd Dog . B. ? The Rough-Coated or wire-haired German Shepherd Dog . C. ? The Long-Coated German Shepherd Dog . A very close undercoat is characteristic of each of the three types . A. ? The Smooth-Coated German Shepherd Dog : The top coat is very dense , each single hair straight , harsh , and lying close to the body . The head , including the inner ear , front of legs , and paws , covered with short hair , and the neck with longer and thicker hair . The fore and hind legs have a // short feather extending to the pasterns and hock respectively . Length of coat varies ; this accounts for the great variety of different length coats . Too short a coat is a fault . A smooth coat which is too long collects dirt , and usually means either a poor or no undercoat . B. ? The Rough-Coated or Wire-Haired German Shepherd Dog : This type is very rare , especially clean-bred instances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shorter haired parts of the smooth dog , such as head and legs ; are , in the rough-coated dog , covered with still shorter wire hair . This wire hair also forms on the lips and eyes , more or less developed beard and eyebrows . Each single hair should be very stiff , hard , and wire-like to the touch , as in the rough-coated German Pinscher . The tail is without feather . In other respects the rough-coated dog corresponds to the smooth-coated type , with the exception of the muzzle , which in the former is a trifle broader and stronger . C. ? The Long-Coated or Old German Type Shepherd Dog : This type is also growing scarce . They are still found in southern and eastern Ger-many as working dogs . As a rule they result from crossing the smooth and rough-coated types . The clean bred Old Type German Shepherd Dog is very scarce . The coat is thick , long , and tangled , rough to the touch . Hair of head falls to the side , partly covering the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paws are long-coated and the tail // bushy . In southern Germany they have mediumsize , hanging ears . In northern Germany , particularly in Hanover and Braunschweig , they are found with erect ears . The long-coated Shepherd Dog is generally all white in color . FAULTS. ? All physical defects which tend to lessen the utility and endurance , especially a combination of short back and legginess in a dog ; built too coarse or too fine ; weak or sway back , straight quarters as well as any point of the running gear which would affect length and evenness of stride , elasticity , and endurance . Furthermore , too short or too soft a coat and absence of undercoat ; skull too coarse or lacking in depth . Muzzle too short or stumpy or too weak , pointed muzzle , also over and undershot . Splay foot ; long-coated paws , except in long-coated type ; hanging as well as badlycarried ears for any length of time , except in longcoated old German type dogs ; rolled or badly-carried tail , cropped ears and docked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same relationship in size and appearance to the rough Collie as the tiny Shetland pony does to some of the larger breeds of horses native to Scotland . They resemble them in everything but size . A good specimen of this dog should be an absolute replica in miniature of the ordinary Collie . They are a true breed inasmuch as they breed to size and type , and in their native country are used for driv- // ing and gathering the sheep inhabiting these windswept isles . In later years they have been bred more as companions and pets than for utility , and for this purpose they are excellent as they have the intelligence and faithful heart of the larger dog to a high degree . The chief points to be looked for in the selection of Shetland Collie puppies are those of the Scotch Collie on a reduced scale . The general description of the breed is as follows : The average weight is about 7 pounds for bitches , and up to io pounds or thereby for dogs . LENGTH OF BODY , from root of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOREARM , 9 inches to IO inches . LENGTH OF HEAD , from occiput to tip of nose , 5 inches to 6 inches . The head should be flat and not over thick in skull , with the muzzle tapering to the nose ; mouth clean-teethed and level . EARS. - Semi- erect , small , and placed high on the head . THE EYE should be well placed and small and dark , with the ordinary intelligent Collie expression . THE FRONT LEGS are straight , strong boned , and short , and beautifully feathered , with plenty of chest frill . HINDQUARTERS strong and well feathered , with the legs clean . TAIL well feathered and carried as the ordinary Collie . COLOR. ? They are found in various colors , such // as black-and-tan , black-tan-and-white , black-andwhite , sable-and-white , and , in that northern climate , they may be found wholly white . THE OUTER COAT is long and glossy , a trifle softer in texture than the ordinary Collie , but with the usual woolly undercoat . This softness of outer coat may perhaps be accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shetland sheep carries a much finer , softer , and more valuable coat than the sheep of our country . // THE POINTER THE Pointer deservedly occupies a high place in the esteem of American sportsmen , for he is at-tractive in form and possesses fine field qualities . The pointing dogs , from which they are descended , originated in Spain during the Middle Ages , and early in the seventeenth century crossed the mountains into France , and eventually found their way over to England . These early Spanish dogs were so heavy , coarse , and cumbersome that English sports-men , with the object of lightening up their heavy frames and gaining more speed , crossed them with the Foxhound . In the colonial days of this country there were many enthusiastic sportsmen , partic-ularly in Maryland and the Carolinas , who imported Pointers from abroad . These were judiciously mated , new dogs brought over from time to time , and eventually their progeny became scattered throughout the country , making warm friends and admirers , so that to-day they are one of the most popular of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not make up to strangers as readily as a Setter , but to his owner he is an affec-tionate and loyal companion . Pointer admirers claim that as a class their short-haired favorites are more naturally inclined to point than Setters ; that they are more easily broken , retain their training // longer , and are more obedient in the field . No question will be raised over the fact that their shortness of coat constitutes a strong recommendation for warm climate or for summer shooting on the prairies or in sections of the country where cockle burrs , sand fleas , nettles , and other pests abound and annoy long-haired dogs to distraction . There is a group of English breeders who are always attempting to improve the Pointer by Foxhound crosses . There is another group , led by William Arkwright , Esq. , of Sutton , Scarsdale , Derbyshire , who have vigorously opposed these crosses . Mr. Arkwright has always stood firmly for pure breeding . He is the foremost living authority on the breed , his opinions have been closely followed by American breeders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept pure and have arrived at a most gratifying regularity of type , combined with brilliant field qualities . There are no accurate records of the Pointers brought to this country previous to 1870 . At that time the magazine Forest and Stream was founded , and it soon attained a wide circulation among sportsmen and fanciers , who began recording in its columns the descriptions and pedigrees of various celebrated dogs as , well as the pedigrees , records , and appearance of the Pointers that were being brought to this country from abroad . The first of these of importance was Sensation , imported by the Westminster Kennel Club . This dog was widely heralded , but he never rose above // mediocrity either as a sire or in the field . Bang Bang , a smaller dog of the celebrated Price strain , brought over at the same time , was in every way his superior , and one of his sons , Consolation , was pronounced the handsomest specimen of his day . A few years later the club imported Naso of Kippen , a dog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed . There was also a noted field dog in St. Louis by the name of Sleaford , and later a dog named Bow , a son of Price 's Bang , which was his equal in the field and his superior on the bench . St. Louis sportsmen then imported Faust , a magnificent animal both in appearance and in the field . The dog , however , that made the greatest impression on the breed was Croxtieth . He was not particularly attractive in appearance , being on the large order , generally coarse , ungraceful in action , with a long , narrow head . He was fast in the field , however , and his sons were better than their sire . Among them may be mentioned Trinket , Trinket 's Bang , Ossian , Robert le Diable . The next dog to be imported was Meteor , who was considerably overestimated . He was followed by a symmetrical dog named Graphic , that was widely advertised and did considerable winning , but was of ordinary ability . In the same kennel were Brackett , Meally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , Lad of Rush , did considerable winning in the nineties . Hempstead Farm Kennels imported Duke of Hesson , and there was another dog named Tammany , that did considerable winning about this time . The // blood , however , that made the greatest impression upon our present-day dogs was a combination of the old English Mike-Romp , the most conspicuous success of this combination being Rip Rap , by King of Kent-Hops . Among other great descendants of King of Kent were Maid of Kent , Kent 's Elgin , Strideway , and Hal Pointer . Jingo , who was the same blood as Rip Rap on his sire 's side , and also founded a family . Among his progeny are Young Jingo , Lad of Jingo , Jingo 's Pearl , Jingo 's Boy , Pearl 's Dot , Syrano , and Two Spot , all names that look well in Pointer pedigrees . Following these dogs came Alfred 's John , one of the greatest bird dogs that has ever been seen at American field trials . At one time there was some uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons and daughters , they were not regarded with the favor of those that we have previously mentioned . Another dog that made a great impression upon the breed was Fishel 's Frank , a consistent winner all over the country , and whose son , Comanche Frank , ran some celebrated races , eventually became a double champion , and whose daughter , Mary Montrose , was the first bird dog to win the Edward Dexter cup . She was brought out and handled by Robert Armstrong , a son of Edward Armstrong , who won the first field trial ever run in England . The Pointer standard is as follows : SKULL. ? Of good size , but not as heavy as in the Too GUN DOGS old Spanish Pointer , and in a lesser degree his halfbreed descendants . It should be wider across the ear than that of the Setter , with the forehead rising well at the brows , showing a decided stop . A full development of the occipital protuberance is indispensable , and the upper surface should be in two slight rounded flats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches to q. / inches ) and broad , with widely opened nostrils . The end must be moist , and in good health is cold to the touch . It should be black or very dark brown in all but the lemons and whites , but in them it may be a deep flesh color . It should be cut off square and not pointed ? known as the " snipe nose " or " pig jaw . " Teeth meeting evenly . EARS , EYES , AND Lips. ? Ears soft in coat , moderately long and thin in leather , not folding like the Hound 's , but lying flat and close to the cheeks , and set on low , without any tendency to prick . Eyes soft and of medium size ; color brown , varying in shade with that of the coat . Lips well developed and frothing when in work , but not pendant nor flew-like . NEcK. ? Arched toward the head , long and round , without any approach to dewlap or throatiness . It should come out with a graceful sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  These are dependent on each other for their formation . Thus , a wide and looped chest can not have the blades lying flat against its sides ; and consequently instead of this ioz THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK and their sloping backward , as they ought to do in order to give free action , they are upright , short , and fixed . Of course , a certain width is required to give room for the lungs , but the volume required should be obtained by depth rather than width . Behind the blades the ribs should , however , be well arched , but still deep ; this last , depth of back ribs , is especially important . BACK , QUARTERS , AND STIFLES. ? These constitute the main propellers of the machine , and on their proper development the speed and power of the dog depend . The loin should be very slightly arched and full of muscle , which should run well over the back ribs ; the hips should be wide , with a tendency even to ruggedness , and the quarters should droop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of firm muscle , and the stifles should be well bent and carried widely apart , so as to allow the hindlegs to be brought well forward in the gallop , instituting a form of action which does not tire . LEGS , ELBOWS , AND HocKs. ? These chiefly bony parts , though merely the , levers by which the muscles act , must be strong enough to bear the strain given them , and this must act in the straight line of progression . Substance of bone is therefore demanded , not only in the shanks , but in the joints , the knees and hocks being especially required to be bony . The elbows should be well let down , giving a long upper arm , and should not be turned in or out , the latter being , however , the lesser fault of the two , as the confined elbows limit the action considerably . IO2 GUN DOGS The reverse is the case with the hocks , which may be turned in rather than out , the former being generally accompanied by the wideness of stifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore pastern should be short , nearly upright , and full of bone . FEET. ? All-important ; for , however strong and fast the action may be , if the feet are not well shaped and the horny covering hard , the dog will soon become footsore when at work , and then will refuse to leave his master 's heels , however high his courage may be . Breeders have long disputed the comparatively good quality of the round , catlike foot and the long one resembling that of a hare . In the Pointer my own opinion is in favor of the cat foot , with the toes well arched and close together . This is the consideraturn of the M. F. H. , and I think stands work better than the hare foot , in which the toes are not arched , but still lie close together . In the Setter the greater amount of hair to a certain extent condones the inherent weakness of the hare foot ; but in the Pointer no such superiority can be claimed . The main point , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the horny covering . STERN. ? Strong in bone at the root , but should at once be reduced in size as it leaves the body , and then gradually taper to a point like a bee 's sting . It should be very slightly curved , carried a little above the line of the back , and without the slightest approach to a curl at the tip . // SYMMETRY AND QUALITY. - The Pointer should display goodly proportion , no dog showing more difference between the " gentleman " and his opposite . It is impossible to analyze the essentials , but every judge carries the knowledge with him . TEXTURE. ? The coat in the Pointer should be soft and mellow , but not absolutely silky . COLOR. ? There is now little choice , in point of fashion , between the liver and the lemon whites . After them come the black and whites ( with or without tan ) , then the pure black , and lastly the pure liver .

Total , Too . THE ENGLISH SETTER The English Setter is one of the handsomest of sporting dogs . Their abundant coats give them an advantage over the Pointer in facing cold , wet , windy weather , or brambles and briars in a rough country . Their admirers also claim they possess more dash and vim , do not thicken up so quickly with age as the Pointer , and that they improve in their work from year to year . The picture pre sented by a well-bred Setter with soft , expressive eye , low-set ear , head chiseled on classic lines , clean-cut neck , graceful outline , and attractive coat and // coloring , leaves nothing to be desired in point of beauty . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The modern Setter is said to be descended from Spaniels which had been trained to stop and set the birds instead of flushing them . The time and place , however , where this first occurred is shrouded in obscurity . The excellences of our present-day Setters can be attributed largely to Edward Laverack . This gentleman , about 1825 , secured a brace of Setters , Ponto and Old Moll , from the Rev. Mr. Harrison , of Carlisle . These dogs he mated , their progeny in turn were interbred , and this formula of breeding was continued for upward of fifty years , in the course of which time Mr. Laverack created a strain of Setters bearing his name , which were as famous for their field qualities as for their beauty . The types of all breeds of dogs have been determined almost entirely by bench shows , and if these had been the only influence that had operated upon the English Setter family , there would be but one recognized type of English Setter . This , however , is not the case , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench shows were getting upon a sound basis , practical sportsmen in both Europe and America instituted field trials for Bird Dogs . These contests have enjoyed a remarkable vogue , and as a result we have had bench show Setter fanciers developing a type of Setter which expressed their ideals of what an English Setter should be , and another group of field trial men devoting all of 1o5 THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK their attention to developing field qualities with an entire disregard for size , color , general type , conformation , and other things that the bench-show men hold most dear . The only question that concerned the field-trial man was utility , his only standard " the survival of the fittest . " The conclusions that men arrive at in writing a bench-show standard as to how a practical working dog should be built and how his head should be supported on his neck or his shoulders placed in relationship to his body , is more or less whimsical and subject to change . There is no way of determining that which is right and that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of some point at the expense of others and losing sight of the fact that under the laws of correlation it is impossible to change one point without changing all others to a greater or less degree . The field-trial men have never permitted details of conformation to detract from their single object of practical performance . As a result of the operation of the law of the survival of the fittest , a field trial type has been evolved that is easily recognized , and breeds truer to type than the bench-show dogs that have been fashioned in response to the opinions of men who were without means for determining the accuracy of their judgment . The bench-show winning Setter to-day is a very elegant animal , but no more so than the field trial dog , with every element of utility expressed in his countenance , written in his frame , and recorded in his pedigree . Io6 GUN DOGS The bench-show Setters of to-day have a Laverack foundation . Half a century ago this was more or Iess mixed with native blood , which disappeared before rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all Laverack , or at least the Laverack strain predominated . Those that followed them were often mixed with other Old English Setter strains , and all of them were distinguished by much grace and beauty , particularly in coat , color , and general outline . Many of them had been bench-show winners abroad and a few had appeared at English field trials . Occasionally they were placed in America , but on the whole they were all lacking the speed , dash , endurance , and unquenchable spirit necessary to win American stakes . Their names are regarded with disfavor in field trial pedigrees . Among the first Laverack dogs to be brought to this country were : Pride of the Border and Fairy ; then came Emperor Fred and Thunder ; Plantagenet and Foreman were prominent in bench shows in the early ' 8o 's , and shortly afterward Rockingham , Princess Beatrice , Count Howard , Monk of Furness , and Cora of Witherall had the center of the stage . In the ' go 's Albert 's Ranger was attracting a good deal of attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dido B , Bloomfield Racket , Blue Bell , Moll O'Leck , Meg O'Leck , Stylish Bell Bonner . All of these dogs while attractive in appearance lacked rugged character and the well-balanced proportions of the field-trial strain . Most of them were // bred in England or were descended from dogs of English breeding which , although they might have proven fairly satisfactory workmen under old country conditions , were unable to cope either in speed , style , endurance , or quick , snappy way of working with the field-trial type . The history of the field trial strain is as follows : About the time the Laverack strain of Setters were in their zenith in England , Mr. R. L. Purcell Llewellin , who for several years had been experimenting with various families of setters , purchased a number of Mr. Laverack 's best dogs of the pure DashMoll and Dash-Lill Laverack blood . These Laveracks he crossed with some entirely new blood , which he obtained in the north of England , represented by Mr. Statter 's and Sir Vincent Corbet 's strain since referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent members of this blood . The result of these crosses was eminently successful , particularly at field trials , and swept everything before them . Their reputation spread to America , and many were purchased by sportsmen in different sections of the United States and Canada , so that this line of breeding soon became firmly established in this country . The name that stands out most conspicuously in the foundation of the field-trial Setter in America is Count Noble . This dog was purchased from Mr. Llewellin by Dave Samborn , of Dowling , Michigan , who , after trying him out on the prairies , was on the point of returning him to England , but was per-Io8 GUN DOGS suaded not to do so by the late B. F. Wilson , of Pittsburgh . The character and qualities that Samborn objected to were those to which Mr. Wilson attached the highest importance . On the death of Mr. Samborn , Count passed into the hands of Mr. Wilson , who gave him opportunity to demonstrate his sterling qualities and his reputation was soon established from coast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is now in the Carnegie Museum , Pittsburgh , where it is visited annually by many sportsmen . Other famous names are : Gladstone , Sue , Druid , Ruby and Gath and their descendants ; Bohemian Girl , Roderigo , Gath 's Hope , Gath 's Mark , Count Gladstone IV , Antonio , Tony Boy , Geneva , Mohawk , Lady 's Count Gladstone , Rodfield , and Count Whitestone II . Thousands of the descendants of these famous dogs are scattered all over the country , and many of them in field trials have perpetuated the fame of this branch of the Setter family . The men who for half a century have owned and bred and raised them have always been deeply concerned with the absolute purity of the line of breeding of their dogs , and have never tolerated an out-cross of any kind and object to a dog whose reputation is based solely upon some bench-show performance . The question of formation , weight , and color have always been of minor importance . Everything has been predicated upon their performance in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single standard of utility they have succeeded in // establishing a general type easily recognized , but for which no standard has ever been written . The standard of the bench-show Setter as approved by the English Setter Club of America is as follows : HEAD , EYES , AND EARS The form of the skull is an eminent characteristic . It should be long , with moderate dome , with but little difference between the width at the base of the skull and the brows , and with a moderately defined occipital protuberance . The brows should be at a sharp and decided angle from the muzzle . The stop should be well defined and clean-cut , with a slight furrow between the eyes . The muzzle should be long , fairly square , of width in harmony with the skull , and without any fullness under the eyes . The lips should not be too full nor too pendant . Between the eyes and point of the nose the line of the muzzle should be straight ; a dish-face or Roman nose is objectionable .

The jaws should be of equal length ; an overshot or undershot jaw is objectionable . The ears should be carried closely , hung well back and set low ; of moderate length , slightly IIO GUN DOGS rounded at the ends ; the leather thin and soft and clothed with silky hair . As a whole , though avoiding extremes , the head should be light rather than heavy , clean-cut , and of length and size in harmony with the body .

Back of the shoulders the ribs should spring gradually to the middle of the body , and then gradually lessen to the back ribs , which should have good depth . BACK , LOIN , AND HIPS. ? The back should be strong at its junction with the loin , sloping upward in a slight rise to the top of the shoulders , the whole forming a graceful outline of medium length ; any sway or drop in the back is objectionable . The loin should be strong , with moderate length , slightly arched , but not to the extent of being roached or wheel-backed . III THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK The hip bones should be wide apart and withou too sudden droop to the root of the tail . FORELEGS. ? The arm should be flat , muscular strong , with bone fully developed , and with muscle hard and devoid of flabbiness ; of good length from the point of the shoulder to the elbow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs fairly under the dog . The elbows should have no tendency to turn either in or out . The pastern should be short , strong , and nearly round , with the slope from the pastern joint to the foot , deviating slightly from the perpendicular . HINDLEGS. ? The hindlegs should have wide , muscular thighs , with well-developed lower thighs . The stifles should be well bent and strong . The hocks should be wide and flat ; the cow hock is to be avoided . The pastern should be short , strong , and nearly round , with the slope from the pastern joint to the foot deviating slightly from the perpendicular . FEET. ? The feet should be closely set and strong , pads well developed and tough , toes well arched and protected with short , thick hair . They should point straight from rear to front . STERN. ? The stern should taper to a fine point , with only length enough to reach the hocks , or less ; the feather must be straight and silky , falling loosely in a fringe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be no bushiness whatever . It should not curl sideways above the level of the back . II2 GUN DOGS CoAT. ? The coat should be flat and of moderate length , without curl ; not too long or soft or woolly .

Markings : Dogs without heavy patches of color on the body , but flecked all over preferred . SYMMETRY. ? The harmony of all the parts is to be considered . Symmetrical dogs will be slightly higher at the shoulders than at the hips . The judge is specially directed to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding and quality , and to avoid massiveness and coarseness . MOVEMENT AND CARRIAGE. ? An easy , free , and graceful carriage , suggesting rapidity and endurance . A merry tail ( whipping from side to side ) and a high carriage of head .

This is singular , in view of the fact that very little is known about his origin , and while he is frequently alluded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have failed to tell what kind of a dog he was either in color or form . In all probability he was a red-and-white dog ; a smart , active animal , full of courage , tireless energy , inclined to be headstrong , and with a nose quite as good as any other dog used for a similar purpose . The American Irish Setter of forty years ago was of this stamp , a favorite among sportsmen , and a successful competitor at the early field trials . In those days there was no particular craze for coat or coloring , and no criticism was aimed at dogs of a light red color or those with white markings , so long as they were courageous and capable workmen in the field . With the advent of dog shows came a demand in the standards for a dark red , mahogany-colored coat . A yellowish coat was not tolerated , and bench-show judges looked with disfavor upon dogs with white mark ings , no matter how useful they might be in other respects . As a result fanciers bred largely for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOGS though they succeeded in getting beautiful dark , rich , solid red dogs , it was at the expense of their utilitarian qualities , and the Irish Setter , once a reckless daredevil , frequently headstrong and difficult dog to break , became so timid that many of them would not stand training . That the Irish Setter is a beautiful dog no one will deny , but if he is to regain his former laurels as a field dog , the demand for a certain color and shade of coat must be forgotten , and dogs must be bred largely on account of their field merits alone . The chief points to look for in the selection of Irish Setter puppies at from two to four months old and after are almost identical with those of the English Setter , with color added , which should , of course , be a deep red . The following is the published description and standard of points of the Irish Red Setter Club : HEAD. ? Should be long and lean . The skull oval ( from ear to ear ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occipital protuberance . Brows raised , showing stop . The muzzle moderately deep and fairly square at end . From the stop to the point of the nose should be long , the nostrils wide , and the jaws of nearly equal length , flews not to be pendulous . The color of the nose dark mahogany or dark walnut , and that of the eyes ( which ought not to be too large ) , rich hazel or brown . The ears to be of moderate size , fine in texture , set on low , well back , and hanging in a neat fold close to head . I15 THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK NECK. ? Should be moderately long , very muscular , but not too thick , slightly arched , free from all tendency to throatiness . BoDY. ? Should be long . Shoulders fine at the points , deep and sloping well back . The chest as deep as possible , rather narrow in front . The ribs well sprung , leaving plenty of lung room . Loins muscular and slightly arched . The hindquarters wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip to hock should be long and muscular ; from hock to heel , short and strong . The stifle and hock joints well bent , and not inclined either in or out . The forelegs should be straight and sinewy , having plenty of bone , with elbows free , well let down , and , like the hocks , not inclined either in or out . The feet small , very firm ; toes strong , close together , and arched . TAIL. - Should be of moderate length , set on rather low ; strong at root and tapering to a fine point ; to be carried as nearly as possible on a level with or below the back . CoAT. ? On the head , front of legs , and tips of ears should be short and fine ; but on all other parts of the body and legs it ought to be of moderate length , flat , and as free as possible from curl or waves . FEATHERING. - The feather on the upper portion of the ears should be long and silky ; on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair amount of hair on the belly , forming a nice fringe , which may extend on chest and throat . Feet to be well I16 GUN DOGS feathered between toes . Tail to have a nice fringe of moderately long hair , decreasing in length as it approaches the point .

THE GORDON SETTER This handsome breed of Setters derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most important kennel of black-and-tan and black-whiteand-tan Setters at a period considerably in advance of dog shows . No claim is made that the Dukes of Gordon originated the breed , and it has also been conclusively proven that they were not responsible for the prejudice against white markings which was developed at bench shows after classes were provided for them in 1861 , which resulted in complete elimination of those specimens containing white in any form . The early history of the Gordon Setter is wrapped in much mystery , considering the fact that they are of comparatively recent origin . A great many writers have stated that in the early days of the I17 THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK breed the Duke crossed one of his best dogs on a black-and-tan Collie named Maddy which lived on the estate and was remarkably clever in finding grouse . It is said that she did not point them , her habit being to stop and watch the birds as soon as she had them located . It is conceded , even by those who deny the authenticity of this story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strains that trace back to the Duke 's kennel , and it is also notable that many Gordon Setters display in working birds a desire to go round their game , just as a Collie goes round a flock of sheep . Another theory is that the breed is the result of crossing the ordinary Setter on the leggy , black Springing Spaniel . There is a similarity in the physiognomy of the Gordon Setter and the Field Spaniel , and the latter in early days was a leggy dog of Setter-like type , so that this cross could have been made without affecting the working characteristics of the Setter . This is a plausible explanation of the dog 's origin . Still another theory provides that the black-andtan Setter has been produced by a cross with the Irish Setter and the black Pointer , which latter is a Scotch product . This likewise is more feasible than the Collie story . All of the explanations are , however , mere conjecture , and there exists no definite or conclusive information on the subject . At the present time the breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dogs there now are heavily crossed with the Laverack and other ii8 GUN DOGS strains . They lack sufficient speed for present-day field trials , but make steady , reliable shooting dogs , as they have splendid noses and biddable dispositions . Their strikingly handsome coloring and intelligence commend them to many people . In selecting Gordon Setter puppies the usual Setter points should be looked for , such as long head ; square muzzle ; well-developed occipital bone ; short body ; deep chest ; straight forelegs ; short , straight tail , and the typical black-and-tan markings , the tan of a rich , dark mahogany . In general appearance the Gordon Setter differs from his English cousin , in that he is heavier all over , showing strength rather than speed in his makeup . His skull is broad between the ears , slightly rounded , with well-developed occiput . Muzzle well carried out to a well-developed nose , showing no snipiness or pinched appearance . Lips and flews should be heavier than those of the English Setter . Eyes dark , with rather a bold look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of the skull , and not too heavily feathered . The coat is usually shorter and stronger than that of the English Setter , and must be entirely devoid of curl . The black should not under any circumstances show brown or rustiness , but be dense , jet black ; the tan should be deep , rich mahogany . The tan should be carried a trifle above the foreleg and should be sharply defined where it meets the black . Black pencilings should appear on the knuckles ; on the hindlegs the insides should be tan , also the inner II9 THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK portion of the breeching and the same color should show slightly down the front of the stifle . The hind pasterns and the hind feet should be penciled like the fore feet . On the head the tan should not extend too far up the lips toward the top of the muzzle , but about half way . The underjaw and throat should be tan , a spot on each cheek and above each eye , and there should also be tan on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running together of colors , but the edges should be clear and well defined .

THE GRIFFON The Pointing Griffon is distinguished from the Griffon Hound , from which he undoubtedly sprang . They are mentioned as far back as the sixteenth century , and paintings and drawings of the seventeenth and eighteenth represent them practically as 4 they are to-day . The celebrated artist , Percival L. Rosseau , who has had much to do with their introduction in this country , in discussing them in an article which he wrote for Forest and Stream a few years ago , says : " A race of dogs that has survived for four centuries must have remarkable qualities , and the Griffon is par excellence a dog for swamps and rough country . His coat affords protection from cold and dampness , thorns and briars , and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country he has no superior . " As a race they are built more for strength and endurance than for speed , although individuals under favorable conditions have shown as good speed and range as any other breed of bird dog . They are at their best , however , in close , careful ranging , covering the roughest ground thoroughly , and in America are especially adapted to grouse , woodcock , and snipe shooting . They are natural retrievers on land and water , easily broken to any kind of game , and their puppies show a higher average of nose and hunting qualities than any other existing breed of dogs . The sportsmen who love rough shooting and derive their greatest pleasure from a mixed bag will find the Griffon admirably adapted to their purpose . " The following standard has been adopted for all Wire-haired Pointing Griffons : HEAD. ? Big and long ; hair rough and thick , not too long , but with mustache and eyebrows well marked ; skull not too wide ; nose long and square ; stop not too pronounced . EARS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low ; hair short , slightly mixed with long wire hair . EYEs. ? Large , not covered by eyebrows ; color , yellow or brown ; expression , always intelligent . NosE. ?

Fairly long and oblique . RIBS. ? Well arched . FORELEGS . ? Straight and vigorous ; hair thick and rough . HINDLEGS. ? Hair thick and rough ; thighs long and well muscled ; hocks well turned . BAcK. ? Vigorous loins , thick and strong . FEET. - Round and firm ; toes well closed . TAIL. ? Carried horizontally , point slightly raised ; hair thick but not feathered ; docked generally onethird to one-half . COAT. ? Color preferable , steel-gray with liver marking or liver mixed with white or roan ; admitted also , white-and-liver and white-and-orange . HAIR. ? Hard and rough , resembling somewhat pig bristles ; never curly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAY DOG THESE splendid retrievers are the only sporting dogs which have a clear claim to the distinction of being absolutely American . They are native to the shores of the historic Chesapeake Bay , and have a racial tree that considerably antedates the period of dog shows . There are a number of stories in regard to their origin . Among them are two recorded in Forest and Stream nearly half a century ago : One is that a vessel from Newfoundland ran aground near an estate called Walnut Grove , on the shores of the Chesapeake . On board the ship were two Newfoundland dogs which were given by the captain to Mr. Law , the owner of the estate , in return for the kindness and hospitality shown him and his crew . It is claimed that a cross between these two Newfoundlands and the common yellowand-tan hound of that part of the country was the origin of the Chesapeake Bay Dog . Another story is that about the year 1807 the good ship Canton , of Baltimore , fell in at sea with an English brig bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sinking condition . The crew were taken aboard the Canton , also a pair of puppies that eventually became the property of the captain of the Canton , and by him I23 THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK were taken to Baltimore . The dog puppy , a dingy red in color , was named Sailor , and the bitch , black in color , was called Canton . Both of these dogs eventually attained great reputations as duck retrievers , and Sailor and Canton are said to be the foundation of the breed . This all may be so , for there is no doubt that as a retriever of dead and wounded ducks no dog equals the Chesapeake . His brave heart , unlimited powers of endurance , and dense coat fit him eminently for braving the roughest weather . Nothing daunts him , and a good specimen of the breed will swim for miles in a rough sea covered with broken ice after a wounded bird . It is one of the few breeds that has always been kept pure , and although at one time it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to-day there are good specimens in various parts of the country . The Chesapeake standard is as follows : HEAD. ? Skull broad and round , with a medium stop ; nose medium , short-muzzle pointed , but not sharp . Lips thin , not pendulous . Ears small , set well up on head , hanging loosely , and of medium leather ; eyes medium large , very clear , of yellowish color , and wide apart . NECK. ? Of moderate length , with a strong muscular appearance ; tapering to shoulders . SHOULDERS , CHEST , AND BoDY. ? Shoulders sloping , and should have full liberty of action , with plenty of power without any restrictions of movement . Chest strong , deep , and wide . Barrel round // and deep . Body of medium length , neither cobby nor roached , but rather approaching hollowness ; flank well tucked up . BACK QUARTERS AND STIFLES. ? Back quarters should be a trifle higher than shoulders ; they should show fully as much power as forequarters . There should be no tendency to weakness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AND FEET .  --  Legs should be medium length and straight , showing good bone and muscle , with well-webbed hare foot of good size . Toes well rounded and close pasterns slightly bent , and both pasterns and hocks medium length ; the straighter the legs the better . STERN. ? Tail should be medium length , varying from : males , 12 inches to 15 inches , and females from II inches to 14 inches ; medium heavy at base , moderate feathering on stern and tail permissible . COAT AND TEXTURE. ? COat should be thick and short , nowhere over one and one-half inches long , with a dense , fine , woolly undercoat . Hair on face and legs should be very short and straight , with tendency to wave on the shoulders , neck , back , and loins only . The curly coat or coat with a tendency to curl not permissible .

The Chesapeake Dog should show a bright , happy disposition and an intelligent expression , with general outlines good , and denoting a worker . Color and coat is extremely important , as the dog is used for duck hunting . The color must be as nearly that of his surroundings as possible , and with the fact that dogs are exposed to all kinds of adverse weather conditions , often working in ice and snow , the color of coat and its texture must be given every consideration when judging on the bench or in the ring .

Total , Too . THE IRISH WATER SPANIEL As to the origin of the . Irish Water Spaniel there is very little authentic information . Mr. McCarthy seems to have been one of , if not the first , exhibitor of the breed and a successful one , although the Irish Water Spaniel was previously kept largely in Ireland for sporting purposes and a valued member of " Ireland 's Reds " ? Red Setter , Red Spaniel , Red Terrier , Red Wolfhound . I26 RETRIEVERS The most feasible theory of his origin is a cross between the Poodle and the Irish Setter . There is much in common in type and character between the Poodle and Irish Water Spaniel ? viz. , in coat , conformation , head , and general character , while in disposition the dog inherits all the dash and determination of the Irish Setter , and partakes of his color , which we can quite understand would be deepened by crossing in again to the Poodle . The Irish Water Spaniel partakes , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although regarded as a trick and fancy dog , will hunt and retrieve on land or water with most Spaniels . The breed has never made the progress with the public that it merited by their many good qualities . They are smart and upstanding in appearance , combining intelligence and endurance with a dashing temperament that make them charming companions . They are also splendid guards for children ; will play with them by the hour and act as their guards in time of danger . The chief points to look for in the selection of Water Spaniel puppies at from two to four months old and after , are : A clean head , dark eye , long ears , short back , short whip tail , good size and bone , straight forelegs , and a dark , close coat . The following description and scale of points is followed by bench-show judges : HEAD ( value 1o ) is by no means long , with very little brow , but moderately wide . It is covered with curls , rather longer and more open than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to be wigged like the poodle . FACE AND EYES ( IO ) are very peculiar . Face very long and quite bare of curl , the hair being short and smooth , though not glossy ; nose broad and nostrils well developed ; teeth strong and level ; eyes small and set , almost flush , without eyebrows . TOPKNOT ( IO ) is a characteristic of the true breed , and is estimated accordingly . It should fall between and over the eyes in a peaked form . EARS ( IO ) are long , the leather extending , when drawn forward , a little beyond the nose , and the curls with which they are clothed two or three inches beyond . The whole of the ears are thickly covered with curls , which gradually lengthen toward the tips . CHEST AND SHOULDERS ( 734 ) . - There is nothing remarkable about these points , which must , nevertheless , be of sufficient dimensions and muscularity . The chest is small compared with most breeds of similar substance . BACK AND QUARTERS ( 712 ) also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , giving an appearance of legginess . LEGS AND FEET ( lo ) . ? The legs should be straight and the feet large but strong ; the toes are somewhat open , and covered with short , crisp curls . In all dogs of this breed the legs are thickly clothed with short curls , slightly pendent behind and at the sides , and some have them all around , hanging in ringlets for some time before the annual shedding . I28 RETRIEVERS No feather like that of the Setter should be shown . The front of the hindlegs below the hocks is always bare . TAIL ( 1o ) is very thick at the root , where it is clothed with very short hair . Beyond the root , however , the hair is perfectly short , so as to look as if the tail had been clipped , which it sometimes fraudulently is at shows , but the natural bareness of the tail is a true character of the breed . COAT ( IO ) is composed of short curls of hair , not woolly , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is objected to as indicative of an admixture with some of the land Spaniels . COLOR ( io ) must be a deep pure liver , without white ; but , as in other breeds , a white toe will occasionally appear with the best litter . SYMMETRY ( 5 ) of this dog is very great . THE FLAT-COATED RETRIEVER There are three varieties of the Retriever ? the curly-coated , the flat-coated ( formerly described as the wavy-coated ) , and the Labrador . The first and last named are the two oldest varieties , the flatcoated dog being of modern manufacture ? in all likelihood the product of the two , with a splash of Spaniel , Newfoundland , or Setter . As to the real origin of the Curly-coated Retriever there is no authentic information , but there can be little doubt that he has been manufactured by a cross with the Poodle , the Irish Water Spaniel , and the Newfoundland , Labrador , or Setter . When // and by whom he was first evolved , however , it is impossible to say , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century , as shown by old prints and paintings , which was certainly before the advent of the flat-coated variety , either as a sporting or bench-show dog . Be that as it may , we have the dog before us whose features are quite distinct from any other variety , and which have long been thoroughly recognized . Indeed , at one time the Curly-coated Retriever was by far the most popular of the three varieties , but he has been somewhat supplanted in the affections of the devotees of this breed by the flat-coat . Still a large number of shooting as well as show men hang tenaciously to the curly-coat , and declare that in all that goes to constitute an allround sporting dog he stands without his equal in the field . The main reason the dog has lost some favor with sportsmen is : first , because of the trouble involved in keeping his coat in order , more particularly for the show bench ; and secondly , because he has been to a great extent supplanted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general conformation , the flatcoated variety differs but little from the curly-coat . The points and features are all practically the same , the only real difference being in coat . This , as already stated , should be flat , the outer coat rather harsh to the touch , there being an undercoat for // warmth , the outer one being for weather resistance . The legs , both before and aft , and the tail should be feathered , and the feet protected by well-feathered pads . In breeding flat-coated Retrievers the object is to produce a strong , well-made , useful dog , showing quality ? a workman in architecture , with the finish of a gentleman . Length of head , good shoulders , a strong loin and quarters , with straight forelegs , and a flat coat are the chief points to aim at and preserve . The flat-coats have rarely the same spring of rib as the curly-coats , in which they reveal their unmistakable Setter ancestry ; but this should be cultivated . Light eyes are a prevailing defect in the flat-coats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is invariably an indication of uncertain temper or a headstrong disposition . The chief points to look for in the selection of flat-coated Retriever puppies at from two to four months old and after , are : A long , level head , free from lippiness ; dark eye ; nicely balanced skull ; small ears set close to side of head ; short back ; short , straight tail ; deep chest ; well sprung ribs ; straight forelegs ; well boned , and a flat , close , dense coat . CURLY-COATED RETRIEVER The Curly-coated Retriever is a much older breed than the Flat-coat , which has to a great extent displaced him in the affections of the public . The Flat-coat has a Setter or Spaniel ancestry , while the iii THE COMPLETE DOG BOOK progenitor of the Curly-coat was undoubtedly a Poodle , a breed at one time plentiful in England and used for sporting purposes . The Curly-coated Retriever is a beautiful dog , and many of them as workmen are the equal of the Flat-coats . They are fully as intelligent , but are believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more difficult to train and handle . The only physical difference of importance between the two breeds lies in the character of their coats , that of the typical Curly-coat being a close fitting , inseparable nigger curl , each knot being solid , and the small locks and curls so close together as to be impervious to water . All parts of the body should be covered as if clothed in astrachan from the occiput to the tip of the tail . The curls on the head should finish in a straight line across the occiput , the hair on the face being short and smooth . The coat requires a good deal of attention . It should never be combed or brushed . If the old coat does not shed it should be carefully pulled out , and open-coated dogs , which do not grow the short , crisp curl , should be clipped all over with horse clippers , as that usually induces the new coat to come out stronger and more tightly curled . In selecting Curly-coated Retrievers look for the conformation and points that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chief points to look for in the selection of Curly-coated Retriever puppies at from two to // four months old and after are identical with those of the flat-coated variety , except the coat , which should be short and crisp at the age given . This description of coat is most likely to develop into the small , tight curls so desirable . The Curly-coated Retriever Club publishes the following standard and scale of points : HEAD. ? Long and narrow for the length . EARs. ? Rather small , set on low , lying close to the head , and covered with short curls . JAws. ? Long and strong , free from lippiness , with good , sound teeth .

LABRADOR This breed of dogs is a compatriot of the Newfoundland , and although they have played an important part in the evolution of the Flat-coated Retriever , one of the most important sporting dogs in Britain , they have never succeeded in attracting much attention to themselves . The Labrador is a sort of Smooth-coated Newfoundland in disposition and character , and a Flatcoated Retriever in appearance . Their names indicate their origin . The breed first made its appearance at those maritime towns in England that were engaged in the fishing industry with Newfoundland . There is no question about this breed being one of the most intelligent of all dogs , lending themselves promptly to all useful purposes . They are extremely courageous and industrious , and are unsurpassed for amiability and faithfulness . Their rough-and-ready // appearance indicative of endurance , and their keen powers of scent were at once recognized by sportsmen , but they have not attracted the attention of the fanciers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was over half a century ago . There is no club for the Labrador either in this country or in England ; consequently there is no fixed standard . It is , however , generally agreed that it should follow closely the standard for Flatcoated Retrievers , with the exception that the Labrador should be slightly smaller in size and lower on leg . The head should also be thicker and the muzzle squarer . The coat should be as smooth , also shorter and denser . The Labrador runs to light eyes . This should not be considered an objection . The Labrador is frequently used for out-crosses on Flat-coated Retrievers that have been too closely inbred . // THE SPANIEL FAMILY THE name borne by this family of beautiful dogs indicates that the parent stock came from Spain . In response to special environment or to gratify the fancy of breeders , or bred to serve useful purposes , they have since divided into several important groups . Just when the Spaniel came to England it is impossible to say , for while the early writers refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lacking in clarity that it is impossible to form an opinion that is free from reservations . The fact that many of the older writers refer to the presence among English sportsmen of a dog used for retrieving wild fowl that was known as the Water Dogge , has prompted writers to jump to the conclusion that this dog was the parent Spaniel type . This is a great mistake . The Water Dogge was not a true Spaniel , but on the contrary was descended from the French Barbet , the ancestor of the Poodle . This early Water Dogge , if old pictures and engravings are to be believed , was quite similar to the modern Irish Water Spaniel and presented the same general confirmation , coat , and topknot . It is probable that both are of Barbet ancestry ; certainly the Irish Water Spaniel is not of true Spaniel type . // The old English Water Spaniel , the progenitor of the modern family of Spaniels , was a distinct breed . Early paintings portray him as being much like the Springer of to-day , differing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly . The old English Water Spaniel was crossed occasionally with other breeds and the progeny mated with careful selection , and from them we have derived the various families of modern Springers , Field Spaniels , Cockers , Sussex , Welch , and diminutive toys . Some of these breeds are useful to the sportsman , others are simply pets ; but from the forty-pound Springer to the fivepound toy , they all resemble each other in marked amiability of character and unusual intelligence . Another important branch of the old English Water Spaniel breed is the setter family . All setters are of Spaniel origin , and early writers refer to the setting Spaniel in contradistinction to those that sprang in and flushed the game , which were known as Springers . There is also another breed of dogs mentioned by Cuvier and other authorities , as the Alpine Spaniel . This dog is said to have been the progenitor of the St. Bernard and the Clumber . However this may be , there is no question but what there is a similarity in coloration between the Clumber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their massive structure and peculiarities of the head , eyes , and flews . The Old English Water Spaniel broke up into the several groups of Spaniels we have enumerated , but unfortunately while the breeds were being created // the parent breed was lost . There have been several attempts to resurrect the parent type without much success , and nothing can be said about them other than that in appearance they probably resembled the modern Springer , the principal difference being a curlier coat . Like him , they were a useful dog that would hunt fur or feather and retrieve from land or water . THE ENGLISH SPRINGER This is probably the prototype of the whole of the sporting Spaniel family . Some of the earliest records speak of the " Springing Spaniel , " and he is no doubt a contemporary of the " Setting Spaniel , " the two dogs doubtless being the only Spaniels in existence at one period . They were probably much the same in type and conformation , the former being taught to " spring " at his quarry in flushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hence the distinction . From the latter the Setter was doubtless evolved , and from the " Springing Spaniel " the whole of the beautiful varieties we now possess have emanated , leaving the original a derelict on the sands of time . It is probably incorrect to say that the old English Springer has ever become extinct , for although he never gained a footing on the English show bench until very recently , when , through the instrumentality of Mr. W. Arkwright and the Sporting Spaniel Society , the Kennel Club was induced to place him on the register , yet he has been kept in his purity in many shooting kennels in different parts of the // country , the owners of which have preferred utility to beauty , ignoring what they have termed " elongated monstrosities " of the show ring . The English Springer is , with the Norfolk Spaniel , one of the most rational dogs in point of architecture of all the Spaniel varieties , viewed from the vantage point of utility . He may be any color almost , and is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short and more symmetrical body , straight front , flat coat , a long head , a square muzzle , rather narrow skull , and low-set ears . His eyes and expression , gait and feathering are distinctly Spaniel . He combines strength with activity , courage with docility , and all the characteristics of a workman . He is a dog of from 4o to 5o pounds in weight . The chief points to look for in the selection of English Springer puppies at from two to four months old and after , are : A long head , lean skull , distinct stop , square muzzle , short , well-balanced body , straight forelegs , longer in proportion than the Field Spaniel , flat coat , down-carried tail . The following description appears in British Dogs : SKULL .  --  Long and slightly arched on top ; fairly broad , with a stop , and well-developed temples . JAws. ? Long and broad , not snipy , with plenty of thin lip . EYES. ? Medium size , not too full , but bright and intelligent , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lobular in shape . NEcK. ? Long , strong , and slightly arched . // SHOULDERS. ? Long and sloping . FORELEGS. ? Of a fair , moderate length , strong boned and straight . BODY. ? Strong , with well-sprung ribs ; good girth , and chest deep and fairly broad . LOIN . Rather long , strong , and slightly arched . HINDQUARTERS. ? Very muscular ; hocks well let down , stifles moderately bent , and not twisted inward or outward . FEET. ? Rather large , round , and hairy . STERN. ? Low-carried , not above the level of the back . COAT. ? Thick , firm , and smooth or slightly wavy ; it must not be too long . The feathering must be moderate on the ears and scanty , but continued down to the heel . COLOR. ? Black , liver , yellow , as self-colors , and pied or mottled with white or tan or both . GENERAL APPEARANCE . An active , compact dog , upstanding , but by no means stilty . His height at shoulder should about equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root of the tail . THE FIELD SPANIEL This is one of the most popular varieties of the Sporting Spaniel , and to all intents and purposes is , in its present form , a modern creation , dating from somewhere about the advent of dog shows . The Field Spaniel is lower on leg and longer in body in proportion than any other Spaniel . This anatomical formation in the first place had its origin // in the production of a Spaniel better adapted for getting under gorse and brushwood than was the Springer and a dog that was less active than the Cocker . It is from these two older varieties , with an admixture of the Sussex , that the beautiful Field Spaniels of to-day , in all their pretty colors , were first evolved . The colors are black-and-tan , black , liver , liver-and-tan , black-and-white , blacktan-and-white , liver-roan , blue-roan , etc . The blacks at one time were the most popular , but the craze for great length of body and lowness on leg was carried to such extremes that the breed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the beautiful chiseling of head , at least in many of the specimens exhibited , and straightness of forelegs , and the activity which all sporting Spaniels should possess more or less . A reaction among sporting men set in , and , owing to their efforts and those of the Sporting Spaniel Club , happily the heavy-headed , crooked-fronted , and sluggish crocodile-like pattern are now happily almost obsolete . We have to-day , too , a more rational type of dog , one that possesses all the features of an animal well fitted to perform the work originally prescribed for him , and yet free from the abnormalities which so disfigured the dog at one stage of his career . The chief points to look for in the selection of puppies at from two to four months old and after of all the varieties of Field Spaniels , black and colored , are practically identical , and are : A long // head , narrow skull , distinct stop ; square muzzle , long body , flat back , short legs , the forelegs being straight and showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following description standard and scale of points has been adopted by the Spaniel Club : GENERAL APPEARANCE. - Considerably larger , heavier , and stronger in build than the " Cocker , " the modern " Field Spaniel , " is more active and animated than the " Clumber , " and has little of the sober sedateness characteristic of the latter . He should exhibit courage and determination in his carriage and action as well as liveliness of temperament , though not in this respect to the same restless degree generally possessed by the " Cocker . " His conformation should be long and low , more so than the " Cocker . " Intelligence , obedience , and good nature should be strongly evident . The colors most preferred are solid black or liver , but liver-and-white , black-andwhite , black-and-tan , orange , and orange-and-white are all legitimate Spaniel colors . HEAD ( value i 5. ) - Long and not too wide , elegant and shapely , and carried gracefully ; skull showing clearly-cut brows , but without a very pronounced " stop ; " occiput distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muzzle long with welldeveloped nose , not too thick immediately in front of the eye , and maintaining nearly the same breadth to the point ; sufficient flew to give a certain squareness to the muzzle and avoid snipiness or wedginess // of face ; teeth sound and regular ; eyes intelligent in expression and dark , not showing the haw , nor so large as to be prominent or goggle-eyed . EARS ( 10 ) should be long and hung low on the skull , lobe-shaped and covered with straight or slightly wavy silky feather . NECK ( 5 ) long , graceful , and free from throatiness , tapering toward the head ; not too thick , but strongly set into shoulders and brisket . SHOULDERS AND ARMS ( Io ) . ? The shoulder blades should lie obliquely and with sufficient looseness of attachment to give freedom to the forearms , which should be well let down . LEGS AND FEET ( 15 ) . - The forelegs should be straight , very strong and short ; hindlegs should be well bent at the stifle joint , with plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with thick , well-developed pads , not flat or spreading . BODY AND QUARTERS ( 20 ) long , with well-sprung ribs ; strong , slightly arching loins , well coupled to the quarters , which may droop slightly toward the stern . COAT AND FEATHER ( 15 ) . ? The coat should be as straight and flat as possible , silky in texture , of sufficient denseness to afford good protection to the skin in thorny coverts , and moderately long . The feather should be long and ample , straight or very slightly wavy , heavily fringing the ears , back or fore legs , between the toes , and on back quarters . TAIL ( Io ) should be strong and carried not higher than the level of the back . // THE COCKER SPANIEL The Cocker Spaniel , unlike the field varieties , is free from any abnormalities , being a rationally built and symmetrical little dog , full of buoyancy and beaming with intelligence , and of tireless energy . Those features and characteristics in the dog account for his popularity . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt exists that the Cocker is among the most ancient of the Spaniel family . He derives the name from the fact that he was first used as an aid to the gun in shooting woodcocks , being a handy little dog in getting through the dense thickets and bramble , while as a retriever he has probably not his equal for nose and cleverness . At all the leading shows in America the Cocker section is a very large one , the classes numerous , and the interest in this merry little sportsman probably keener than it is in England . A few years ago this breed showed signs of degenerating as sporting dogs , having drifted into toyishness on the one hand and become too low on leg in many cases , although , to the credit of breeders it may be said , that the true type of the dog was never lost . Cockers even vary very much in size and type . We have the Devonshire Cockers and the Welsh Cockers , and others indigenous to different districts of the country to which they are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type now recognized in the show ring , and that is the short- // coupled , sturdy , well-balanced , good-fronted flatcoated dog with a nicely chiseled head , dark eye , and square muzzle , who looks like and is a workman from stem to stern , a dog of from 23 to 27 pounds . The chief points , therefore , to aim at in breeding Cocker Spaniels are compactness of body , straightness of forelegs , squareness of muzzle , dark eyes , and flat coats , with a down-carriage of stern . Common defects in the breed , especially the colored variety , are crooked fronts , light eyes , and cocktails , which are an abomination alike to sporting men and to good judges . The chief points to look for in the selection of Cocker Spaniel puppies , any color , from two to four months old and after , are : A nicely balanced head , distinct stop , square muzzle , dark eye , short , compact body ; well balanced in proportion to length of leg , down-carried tail and flat coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 8 ) . - Not so heavy as in other Sporting Spaniels , with smooth forehead and clearly defined eyebrows and stop , the median line distinctly marked and gradually disappearing until lost rather more than half way up a well-developed , rounded , and comparatively wide skull , showing no prominence in the cheeks , which , like the sides of the muzzle , should present a smooth , clean-cut appearance . MUZZLE ( 1o ) . -Proportionately shorter and lighter than the Field Spaniel , showing no fullness under // the eyes , the jaws even and approaching squareness . Teeth sound and regular , the front ones meeting . Lips cut off square , preventing any appearance of snipiness . Nose well developed in all directions and black in color excepting in the reds , livers , parti-colors of these shades , and in roans of the lighter lines , when it may be brown or black . EYES ( 7 ) . ? Comparatively larger , round , rather full , yet never goggled nor weak , as in the toy Spaniel kinds . They should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parti-colors and roans . In the reds and livers and in the particolors and roans of these colors they should be brown , but of a shade not lighter than hazel . EARS ( 4 ) . ? Lobular , set low , leather fine , and not extending beyond the nose ; well clothed with long , silky hair , which should be straight or wavy . NECK AND SHOULDERS ( 15 ) . ? Neck sufficiently long to allow the nose to reach the ground easily , muscular , free from throatiness , and running into clean-cut , sloping shoulders , which should not be wide at the points . BODY ( i8 ) . ? Comparatively short , compact , and firmly knit together , giving the impression of a concentration of power and untiring activity . Chest deep rather than wide , not narrow-fronted nor yet so wide as to interfere with free action of the forelegs . Ribs well sprung , deep , and carried far back ; short in the coupling and flank , free from any tucked appearance . Back and loin immensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // dog , the former level and the latter slightly arched . Hips wide , with quarters considerably rounded and very muscular . LEGS AND FEET ( 18 ) . - Forelegs short and straight , though proportionately longer than in any of the other breeds of short-legged Spaniels ; strongly boned and muscled , with elbows well let down and straight , short , strong pasterns . Hindlegs proportionately short . Stifles well bent , strong thighs clearly defined . Hocks clean , strong , well let down , bent and turning neither in nor out , the hindquarters from a back view presenting an impressive combination of propelling power . Feet neither small nor large , round , firm , not spreading , and with deep , strong , horny pads and plenty of hair between the toes . They should turn neither in nor out . STERN ( 5 ) . - Should be set on and carried level with the back , and when at work its action should be incessant in this the brightest and merriest of the whole Spaniel family . COAT ( lo ) . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with ample Setter-like feather . COLOR AND MARKINGS ( 5 ) . ? Blacks should be jet black and reds , livers , etc. , should never be faded or " washy " shades , but of good , sound colors , white on the chest of self-colors , while objectionable , should not disqualify . WEIGHT. - NOt under 18 nor exceeding 24 pounds . GENERAL DESCRIPTION. -A neat-headed , wideawake , serviceable-looking little dog with an expression of great intelligence ; short in body when // viewed from above , yet standing over considerable ground for one of his inches upon strong , straight front legs , with wide , muscular quarters suggestive of immense power , especially when viewed from behind . A downward tendency in front he ought not to possess , but should stand well up at the shoulders like the clever little sporting dog that he is . Massive in appearance by reason of his sturdy body , powerful quarters , and strong , well-boned limbs , he should nevertheless impress one as being a dog capable of considerable speed , combined with great powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quick and merry , with an air of alertness and a carriage of head and stern suggestive of an inclination to work . THE CLUMBER SPANIEL This handsome and useful member of the Spaniel family is of ancient lineage , and his solemn and majestic aspect mark him as a true aristocrat of long descent . The Clumbers are deserving of their popularity with shooting men , for ho dog is a more capable assistant to the gun as they are by inclination the keenest and most persevering of hunters , have the best of noses , and , considering their massive build , have remarkable powers of endurance . The Clumber Spaniel is easily trained , easily controlled , and unusually intelligent . They take naturally to retrieving , are good water dogs , and as allround workmen have no superiors . There is a good deal of mystery about the origin // of this breed , and history carries them back to the middle of the eighteenth century . About that time the French Duc de Noailles presented a kennel of Spaniels to the second Duke of Newcastle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the breed is said to have originated ; certainly it is here that it received its name . There is no trace of their origin in France , for there at the present day at least the Clumber is accepted as a purely English product . It has been suggested that the Duke , finding that the Spaniels that had been presented to him were too fast , reduced their pace by crossing them on some heavier breed . What the cross or crosses were will never be known , but the Clumber 's general type , his massive frame , powerful limbs , white coat with lemon markings , and his solemn and majestic aspect and demeanor suggest the St. Bernard . There is also a theory that they owe their origin to a cross of Baron Cuvier 's Alpine Spaniel , a dog indirectly related to the St. Bernard . The Clumber Spaniel has been very successful in the English Spaniel trials , and the most convincing evidence of their worth is the tenacity with which the owners of old strains hang on to them and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In selecting Clumber puppies look for short , massive heads , square muzzles , well marked stop ; low-set , massive body of moderate length ; big bone ; flat , dense coat ; down-carried tail and pale orange or lemon markings . // The standard and value of points is as follows : GENERAL APPEARANCE AND SIZE. ?

The breed , however , // have been kept pure only by excessive in-breeding , which has impaired their constitutions . In consequence puppies are often delicate and hard to raise , but are hardy after they arrive at maturity . The well-bred Sussex is a beautiful Spaniel , for his symmetrical proportions are clothed in a rich red coat that would lend distinction to any dog . In the field they are most reliable workmen , somewhat slower to be sure than the leggier Springer , but surpassing them in patience and perseverance . They will force their way through the thickest cover and allow nothing to escape them . They differ from the rest of the Spaniels by giving tongue on scent , and those who are accustomed to them can tell by the difference in their tone whether they are after fur or feather . The modern Field Spaniel gets his size and weight from the Sussex Spaniel , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing other breeds . The chief points to look for in the selection of Sussex Spaniel puppies at from two to four months old and after , are : A short , massive head , square muzzle , well-defined stop , lengthy body on short , straight forelegs ; great bone , flat coat of a deep golden color , down-carried tail . The descriptive particulars of this breed are as follows : HEAD. ? The skull should be moderately long , and also wide , with an indentation in the middle , and a full stop ; brows fairly heavy ; occiput full but not // pointed , the whole giving an appearance of heaviness without dullness . EYEs. ? Hazel color , fairly large , soft and languishing , not showing the haw overmuch . NosE. ? The muzzle should be about three inches long , square , and the lips somewhat pendulous ; the nostrils well developed and liver color . EARS. - Thick , fairly large , and lobe-shaped ; set moderately low , but relatively not so low as in the Black Field Spaniel ; carried close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . NECK is rather short , strong , and slightly arched , but not carrying the head much above the level of the back . There should not be much throatiness in the skin , but well-marked frill in the coat . CHEST AND SHOULDERS. - The chest is round , especially behind the shoulders , deep and wide , giving a good girth . The shoulders should be oblique . BACK AND BACK RIBS. - The back and loin is long , and should be very muscular , both in width and depth ; for this development the back ribs must be deep . The whole body is characterized as low , long , level , and strong . LEGS AND FEET. ? The arms and thighs must be bony , as well as muscular , knees and hocks large and round , and with short hair between the toes . The legs should be very short and strong , with great bone , and may show a slight bend in the forearm , and be moderately well feathered . The hindlegs should not be apparently shorter than the forelegs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a Settery // appearance , which is so objectionable . The hindlegs should be well feathered above the hocks , but should not have much hair below this point . The hocks should be short and wide apart . TAIL should be docked from five to seven inches , set low , and not carried above the level of the back ; thickly clothed and moderately long feather . COAT .  --  Body coat abundant , flat , or slightly waved , with no tendency to curl ; moderately well feathered on legs and stern , but clean below the hocks . COLOR. ? Rich golden liver . This is a certain sign of the purity of the breed , dark liver or puce denoting unmistakably a recent cross with the black or other variety Field Spaniels . GENERAL APPEARANCE. ?

THE WELSH SPRINGER The Welsh Springer is a smart , active Spaniel , more lightly built and smaller than Field Spaniels , being very little larger than the Cocker . They are invariably white in color , with red or deep orange markings . They have beautifully chiseled heads , // small Clumber-shaped ears , and are generally most attractive . The Welsh Springer is undoubtedly an old breed that has been used by the sportsmen of Wales , who refer to them not as Spaniels , but as Starters . They are eminently sportsmanlike in appearance , and have proven themselves to be capital workmen in the field , so that their future popularity is assured . They have made great headway on the English benches , and their classes are well filled with specimens of uniform type . The Welsh Springer is a dog of from 30 to 40 pounds weight , proportionate in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grand spring of rib , and powerful hindquarters . He may be described as an enlarged Cocker , but shows less feathering than is found in most of the other varieties , and the ears are also shorter . As in all Spaniels , snipiness and thick heads are common defects , and the Welsh Springer is no exception . This said , the breed is at once a rational one , and possesses all the traits of his English cousin , while the uniformity of color and its irregular distribution give to a group of Welsh Springers quite a picturesque appearance . In this way the variety has made great headway on the show bench and enlisted a number of enthusiasts within its ranks , who are much devoted to the breed not only for its general beauty , but also for its wonderful prowess in the field . The chief points to look for in the selection of // Welsh Springer puppies at from two to four months and after , are almost the same as those of the English Springer , the recognized color being , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Welsh members of the Sporting Spaniel Society : SKuLL. ?

A quarter of a century must have elapsed since a specimen of this breed was exhibited . As a kennel terrier and companion the name of the Old English Terrier is prominent in the history of country sport , and he is doubtless the progenitor of the more popular and plentiful Fox Terrier . The Black-and-Tan Broken-haired Old English Terrier is a dog of very great antiquity . He appears in some of the oldest prints and paintings , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without him . To-day his ranks are thinned even in the hunting field , whilst he is now nearly unknown on the show bench . Such a sterling Terrier in make and shape , in hardihood and grit should not be allowed to lapse into obscurity . No breed either from the point of view of antiquity , tradition , appearance , and utility was or is more deserving of perpetuation . Those who know agree that they possess traits to be cherished in the heart of anyone who loves a dog for his worth and not for what he would fetch in the market . // Fox-Terriers and Airedales , two popular breeds which have circled the world , owe most of their Terrier traits , external and internal , to their part progenitor , the Old English Broken-haired Terrier , while the latter has almost entirely passed away . The chief differences between the Old English and the Welsh Terrier are in size , the latter being a few pounds heavier . The Old English Terrier had a long , strong , punishing jaw , level mouth , flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , determined eye ; good bone , coat hard to the touch ; colors , black-and-tan and grizzle-and-tan . THE BLACK-AND-TAN TERRIER There was a Black-and-Tan Terrier in England before the days of dog shows , less graceful in outline and coarser in type , to be sure , than those of to-day . These early dogs did not present the fancy marks of penciled toes and dotted brows ; their tan was smutty , but nevertheless they were sound , game , and useful dogs , the most accomplished of rat killers whether in the pit or along water courses . The Manchester district was a noted center for two " poor men 's sports " ? rat killing and rabbit coursing . A fancier by the name of John Hulme , with the idea of producing a dog that could be used at both contests , bred a whippet bitch to a celebrated rat-killing dog , a cross bred terrier dark brown in color . The result of this cross was very satisfactory , the dogs proved useful , and other fanciers in the neighborhood took to breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
