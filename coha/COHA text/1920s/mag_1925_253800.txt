" On the contrary , the terms of the proposed agreement left them free to put Duke above Deity and retain the two . <P> This they did , at a meeting held last week . They resolved that to the list of Trinity Colleges-Oxford , Cambridge , Edinburgh , London , Dublin , Toronto Universities-there now be added Trinity College , Duke University . Mr. Duke , who is on the Trinity board , did not vote for the resolution , but all the rest did , including six absentees , who sent proxies . <P> At a meeting held in October , the Trinity trustees had approved a plan for " the expansion of this historic college , " as outlined by President Few , on condition that funds be found . Last week , with undreamed of funds already in their midst , they found their condition met . For months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjacent to the present campus .
