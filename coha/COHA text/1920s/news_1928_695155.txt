txt In a little more than a year officers of the United States Marine Corps in Nicaragua have transformed crude native material into a non-partisan military force for police duty . The same work was done in Cuba after the war with Spain , in the Philippines and in Haiti . At the end of the second intervention in Cuba the Rural Guard had been drilled into a high state of efficiency by American officers . On parade and on the match the Cubans could hardly be , distinguished from American regulars . The color line was not drawn , but most of the officers were white . The men handled their rifles well in manoeuvres and showed themselves prompt in the discharge of their duty on patrol . While General BARRY was still in command at Camp Columbia there was a rising in Oriente  --  that is to say , a squad of men took to the manigua and defied the authorities . The guard was called upon to bring them in . In the revolution of 1895-98 most of the fighting was done at long range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both Spaniards and Cubans being very wary of ambush . But in this emeute during the American occupation a battalion of the Rural Guard , under the lead of its white officers , rushed every position of the insurgents and captured or killed most of them . Today the Rural Guard takes the place of a standing army and continues to be an admirable force for preserving order . In Haiti the marine officers under General RUSSELL have converted ungainly blacks into smart , upstanding , active soldiers . Well fed and uniformed and treated with consideration , the men of the Haitian constabulary have never failed General RUSSELL in an emergency . Many of them are expert marksmen . A squad was taken over to France several years ago and won the highest honors at the butts . The marine officers have taught the native Haitians not only how to be capable soldiers but how to live , and they show their gratitude by fidelity . As was the case in Cuba , a trained force that can be used as a standing army to support the Government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Philippine constabulary and the Scouts are an old story . As police and troops they would be a credit to any country . There can be no doubt that such training as that given by American officers in Cuba , the Philippines and Haiti has contributed to the cause of law and order . Nicaragua is on a somewhat different basis . The marines are there ostensibly to supervise a national election , but the protection of Americans and their property is involved on account of the defection of SANDINO . Practically a state of war between this Nicaraguan irregular and the marines has existed for about a year . To perform police duty and to take the field as allies in the campaign against SANDING a Guardia Nacional was organized . It now ha. , 1 a ** of 1 , C00 men and 100 of ficers . It keeps the peace in the cities , the marines remaining in the background . In several skirmishes with Sandinistas the Guardia Nacional has shown spirit and courage under fire . It has been fashioned into a fine body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised to 3,000 men . After the election and the inauguration of a President , the Government should be able to maintain itself with the well-trained army turned over to it .
