At both sides of the stage are boxes of various sizes , but none very large  --  orange boxes , canned goods boxes , covered with burlap or bits of rug . These are rocks . The action of this play takes place in the dark , but I wish it to be played in bright light . Mrs. Carter , very attractive and looking less than her thirty-eight years , enters tentatively feeling her way in the dark . She is followed by her son , Tom , sixteen . MRS . CARTER Take my hand , Tom . I do n't know where you children inherited your ability to see in the dark . ( Tom passes her and starts slowly leading her forward . ) TOM It is n't dark at all . All these stars reflected in the lake .  --  There 's a sort of path here , Mother . The rocks are at the side of it . MRS . CARTER ( Stopping ) : Fireflies . All those fireflies .

Why do I always make a mistake when I add a six and a seven ? Why have I an ever so faint tiny prejudice against people whose name begins with B  --  Blodgetts and Burnses and Binghams and even dear old Mrs. Becket .

She 's the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesca hate to come here ? MRS . CARTER What ? TOM She hates to come out on this point of land . She told me once  --  but then she was sorry she told me . She told me that every now and then she dreamed that she was on this point of land , and that when she dreamed it , it was a nightmare and she woke up crying or screaming or something . MRS . CARTER ( Thoughtful ) : You must n't tease her about it . Promise me you wo n't tease her about it . TOM All right . MRS . CARTER Now take my elbow and lead me to a rock that I can remember at the very tip of the point . ( As they progress ) No  --  all those quirks , as you call them , are like wrecks at the bottom of the sea . They mark the place where there was once a naval battle  --  or a storm .

Your father used to find arrowheads here . p. 5 TOM What did you used to think about ? MRS . CARTER Oh , what do young girls think about ? I remember once I made a vow : never to marry . Yes . I was going to be a doctor . And at the same time I was going to be a singer . But I was n't going to sing in concerts for money .

TOM I did n't . I heard them talking about it . I canoed back across the lake and got your guitar You do n't hate to sing . MRS . CARTER Oh , I 'll sing , if anybody asks me to . It 's not important enough to make any discussion about . ( Silence .

He explains simply and casually ) This is really a sand dune here . Until recently there was a great big lake over all this area . When the lake shrunk , there were these dunes . Ordinarily , it takes about five thousand years for the first grasses to get their roots in and to make enough humus for small bushes to grow . Then it takes about 10,000 years for the bushes to make enough humus for the white pines . Then come the red pines . Probably it was faster here because of these rocks . They prevented the top sand from being blown away every few days . That 's why the trees are so much bigger here , and over at the Cavanaughs , and around the boat club Rocks . p. 7 FRANCESCA ( Off ) : Mo-o-ther ! MRS . CARTER Yes , dear , here I am .

( Imitating a teacher ) " I was just saying to Mrs. Carter : I do n't know what 's to become of Francesca . In all my ninety years of teaching I 've never known such a problem child . " FRANCESCA ( Airily ; leaving ) : Tz-tz-tz . TOM ( Urgently ) : Be a sweet little flower box and get me a hamburger . FRANCESCA Mother , do n't you let Tom have another .

FRANCESCA Violet this and Violet that . ( Louder ) He even started a fight over her . TOM ( Rising and starting off ) : Quack-quack-quack ! I 'll be back . Honk-honk-honk . ( Tom leaves . ) MRS .

CARTER No . But when you do , you talk so well . p. 9 FRANCESCA ( Softened ; with wonder ) : Do I ? ( Kneeling before her mother ) Do I , really ? MRS . CARTER I should n't have to tell you that . FRANCESCA Thank you . ( Enter Mr. Carter , forty-three , lawyer , with a blanket . ) MR . CARTER Mary ? MRS . CARTER Here I am , Fred . MR . CARTER Try this rock . It 's drier .

FRANCESCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fight with the MacDougal boy  --  I was n't there . Just some craziness or other . MRS . CARTER Do you know anything about it , Fred ? MR . CARTER Yes . I 'll tell you about it later . FRANCESCA But that 's not really what upset him . A very funny thing happened . Before supper we were all lying around the dock and somebody said that you were going to sing tonight at the bonfire . And that boy from Milwaukee said : " Mrs. Carter sing ! She 's too old ! " ( Francesca thinks this is very funny . Gales of laughter ) He 'd mixed you up with Mrs. Cavanaugh ! ! And Paul or Herb said : " She is n't old . She is n't any older than " their own mothers . And the boy from Milwaukee said : " Sure , she 's old . She 's nice and all that , but she ought n't to be allowed to sing . " He thought Mrs. Cavanaugh was you ! ! ( More laughter ) But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CARTER What ? FRANCESCA Tom 's face . You 'd have thought he was seeing a ghost . And the boy from Milwaukee said : " Why , she 's got all those gray hairs . " ( Gales of laughter ) You remember how at breakfast a few days ago you said you 'd found some more gray hairs ? MRS . CARTER Yes . FRANCESCA And Tom was believing all this was about you . Well , I thought he 'd either jump on the boy and kill him , or go away and maybe throw up . MR . CARTER What did he do ? MRS . CARTER He canoed back across the lake to get my guitar . MR . CARTER Francesca , I want to talk to your mother alone a moment . FRANCESCA ( Touch of pique ) : All right but kindly do n't mention me . ( She goes out ; very queenly . Pause . ) MR . CARTER Well , what do you think about that ? I suppose in the code , a boy ca n't strike another boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old age . MRS . CARTER What was this other story about a fight ? p. 11 MR . CARTER Very odd . Very odd . Tom is not a bulldog type . There 's a new girl here  --  a cousin of the Richardsons . I do n't know her name . MRS . CARTER Violet . MR . CARTER Yes , Violet Richardson . It looks as though Tom had taken a sudden fancy to her . She does n't seem interesting to me  --  neither pretty nor individual . Anyway , he was sitting beside her  --  and the MacDougal boy  --  the bigger one  --  Ben  --  came up and began pulling at her arm to get her to go over where some of them were dancing . Suddenly Tom got up in an awful rage . Told him to let her alone . She was talking to him . Not to stick his nose in where he was n't wanted . It all flared up in a second : two furious roosters ; two stags fighting over a doe . The MacDougal boy backed down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a second , too  --  but it was real it was very real and hot . ( Slight pause . ) MRS . CARTER And I thought this was going to be just one more dull picnic ! ( Mr. Carter lights a pipe and goes to sit on the rock where his wife had been sitting . ) Fred , Tom just told me that Francesca hated to come here  --  that she had bad dreams about it ? Did you ever know that ? MR . CARTER What ?  --  Here , this point of land ! p. 12 MRS . CARTER Can you think of any reason for it ? MR . CARTER No ! MRS . CARTER I 'll give you a hint : a robin redbreast . MR . CARTER What are you getting at ? MRS . CARTER A dead robin ? The children were about six and seven . We had told them there had been an Indian graveyard here . They had found a dead robin in the woods , and they set out to bury it I came on : such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deathly ill  --  MR . CARTER Do I remember ! ! It was one of the most shattering experiences in my life ! ! MRS . CARTER Dr. Macintosh kept asking us what she had eaten , and I  --  stupidly , stupidly  --  failed to connect convulsions and hysterics with the burial of Robin Red Breast . Francesca had learned about death You sat soothing her and reading aloud to her until the sun rose . MR . CARTER And ever since she dislikes the color red . MRS . CARTER And the same experience had no effect on Tom , whatever . Yet we always think of Tom as the sensitive one and Francesca as the sensible one . MR . CARTER I guess , growing up is one long walk among perils  --  among yawning abysses ( Silence . ) Well , since you 're talking about old times  --  I 'm going to interrogate you . We 've just heard that Tom had a fight . A fight over a girl named Violet . Does the name Violet bring back anything to you ? p. 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARTER The color ? MRS . CARTER No . MR . CARTER Think a minute . ( She shakes her head . ) A dress you wore ? MRS . CARTER Fred , you would n't remember that ! Your sister brought me back from Italy that beautiful silk . I had a dress made from it . MR . CARTER Go on . MRS . CARTER Then I bought various things to match it beads MR . CARTER I called it " your violet year " perfume ! MRS . CARTER Absurd just before the war 1940 and 41 . ( Pause ) What are you implying ? Tom would n't have known anything about that ! MR . CARTER ( Dismissing it unhesitatingly ) : Of course not . He would have been only two . ( With teasing , flirtatious intention ) It was myself I was thinking of . He is infatuated with a Violet , just as I was . MRS . CARTER Now , go away to think wives wear you 're in the way , Fred . p. 14 MR . CARTER ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my troubles on that rock , too . ( Tom appears at the entrance , carrying a guitar . ) TOM I could have found my way here by the smell of Father 's pipe . ( He stops , closes his eyes and smells it ) Christmas is coming . You 'll need some more of that tobacco . ( He gropes ) I know its name . No , do n't help me ah ! " Bonny Prince Charlie . " ( He puts the guitar on his mother 's lap ) MRS . CARTER What 's this ? Oh  --  my guitar . Maybe they wo n't call for me . MR . CARTER ( Starting off ) : Are you sure you 're warm enough ?  --  Tom , do you remember coming out here with Francesca when you were six and holding a funeral over a robin redbreast ? TOM ( Lightly ) : No , did I ? Did I , really ?  --  Why ? MRS . CARTER We were just wondering , Tom . ( Exit Mr. Carter.Tom gets down on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squad that was picking up the trash . I rolled the ice cream cans to the truck . I showed Polly Springer how to put a marshmallow on a fork .  --  I 've done my duty . I can rest . ( Silence . ) Mother , make one chord on the guitar . ( She does a slow arpeggiated chord . Silence. ) p. 15 TOM One note of music out of doors is worth ten thousand in a building . ( He again turns over on his stomach , raises himself on his elbows ) Mother , I 'm going to be the doctor that you planned to be . MRS . CARTER Oh !  --  Not an astronomer ? Or a physicist ? TOM No . That 's all too far away . I 'm going to be a research doctor . MRS . CARTER ( Not hurrying ) : Well , you do n't have to decide now . TOM ( Decisively ) : I 've decided .  --  Last month I thought maybe I 'd be one of those new physicists . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others 'll get there before me Besides , that 's not hard enough . Any Joe will be able to find that one of these days . I want something harder something nearer . For instance  --  ( Voice offstage : " MRS . CAAAR-TER . " Nearer : " MRS . CAAAR-TER ! " ) MRS . CARTER ( Raising her voice ) : Ye-es . Here I am . VOICE The bonfire 's starting . They want you to come and sing . MRS . CARTER Is that you , Gladys ? Tell them to start singing . I 'll come soon . p. 16 VOICE All-riiight . MRS . CARTER You were saying you wanted to do something harder . TOM Harder and nearer . ( Beating the ground ) There 's no reason people have got to grow old so fast . I guess everybody 's got to grow old some day . But I 'll bet you we can discover lots of things that will put it off . I 'll bet you that three hundred years from now people will think that we were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't any crazy idea about people living forever ; but it 's funny : I do n't mind getting old , but I do n't like it to happen to other people . Anyway , that 's decided . ( He puts his head in his arms and closes his eyes as though going to sleep ) It 's great to have something decided . ( Pause ) Mother , what was the name of that nurse I had when I was real young , the southern one ? MRS . CARTER Miss Miss Forbes . TOM What was her first name ? MRS . CARTER Let me think a minute Maude ? No . ( Trouve ) Madeleine ! TOM Do you remember any teacher I had back then that was named Violet ? MRS . CARTER N-n-n-o. p. 17 TOM ( Dreamily ) : There must have been somebody I remember it was like floating and the smell of violets . Golly , I go crazy when I smell them . I 'll tell you why I was so polite to old Mrs. Morris  --  you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ever wear that , Mother ? Do n't you like it ? MRS .

CARTER Do you feel like singing or not ? They 're making a fuss about you down there . MRS . CARTER Why not ? ( Enter Francesca , running . ) FRANCESCA Mother , they 're stamping their feet and  --  MRS . CARTER I 'm coming .  --  I ( She starts tuning the guitar . Going out ) What 'll I do , Tom ? I 'll do ( They are out . Silence . ) FRANCESCA The fireflies the moon . ( Mr. Carter takes the blanket from the rock , carries it across the stage and wraps it around the rock he formerly sat on ; then , sitting on the floor , leans his back against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I went into your study , and I stole some of that tobacco . I put it in an envelope . And in the tent after lights out , I 'd take it out and smell it Why do they call it " Bonny Prince Charlie " ? ( Pause ; dreamily ) I like the name of Charlie I 've never known a stupid boy named Charles . Is n't that funny ? They all have something about them that 's interesting .

CARTER That someday maybe I 'd have a family . That someday maybe I 'd go into politics . FRANCESCA And now you 're senator ! MR . CARTER Tom 's not interested in this place as a human place . He 's always talking about it as a place before there were any human beings here . But even as boy , I used to think all that must have gone on here .  --  Initiations  --  FRANCESCA What ? MR . CARTER Initiations into the tribe . And councils about those awful whiteskins . And buryings . ( Pause ) On this very rock I decided to become a lawyer . FRANCESCA ( Moving a few feet toward him on her knees ) : Papa , why was I so mean to Mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , slowly ) : Yes , I was . When I was telling that story about the boy from Milwaukee mistaking Mother for an old woman , like Mrs. Cavanaugh . I knew I was mean while I was doing it .

( She stares at him ) Yes , now you 're being mean toward yourself !  --  Could you imagine building a house on this point ? FRANCESCA No . . . MR . CARTER Because you 'd have to cut down so many trees ? FRANCESCA ( Slight pause ) : No I could do it without cutting down the best trees . MR . CARTER Why could n't you imagine building here ?

( Mr. Carter holds out his hand and Francesca moves closer and takes his hand . They both look into the distance , lost in their thoughts and feelings , as the lights fade. )
