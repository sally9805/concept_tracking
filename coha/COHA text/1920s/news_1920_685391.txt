txt JOHN W. DAVIS FOR PRESIDENT . More Views on the Availability of the Ambassador for the Democratic Nomination . I desire to commend your able indorsement of John W. Davis for President . Your course is a wise one for the party and the country . Having known Mr. Davis intimately for over twenty-five years , we are familiar with his excellent qualifies as a man of unusual ability and integrity , as well as with his public career , marked as it is with such distinguished ability and success . You have not overdrawn-the greatness nor the fitness of Mr. Davis for this great office . He is fortunate in that both his parents were good people . His father was a distinguished lawyer , a great thinker , and of high ideals ; his mother was a brilliant and educated woman . Thus Mr. Davis not only inherited a good mind and a good body , but he made good use of his opportunities , and his ability as a lawyer , statesman , business man and thinker is only equaled by ' his high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only comprehensive , but analytical ; his thinking is clear , his vision is broad , and his judgment is of the best . All who know Mr. Davis intimately not only honor him but love him . His every bearing marks him as a gentleman of great ability and distinction ; yet the most humble citizen can easily approach him . He has never been a politician seeking . place , and does not advertise . He became a candidate for Congress only at the last hour , under the overwhelming pressure of his friends , who knew his great ability to serve his party and the country . As the party in 1912 sought the man " of the hour , " why should it not do so again in 1920 ? Clear was the call of the party at Baltimore for Woodrow Wilson ; equally clear it seems to me today is the call of the party and the call of the nation for Ambassador John W.

A Man for Independents , I am one of 500,000 voters , Democrats and Republicans , who are desirous of voting for Herbert Hoover for President of the United States . We base our wish on his character and abilities shown by what he has done , not on what he hen said . It seems that we are not to bo allowed to express our decided preference . We are therefore much indebted to you for starting a movement that may give tie a chance to vote for the next best man , Mr. Davis of West Virginia . Either would do much to rescue the public business of the country from its present lametablo condition . Could or would any other man effect as much ? CHARLES F. JOHNSON . Hartford , May 28 , 1920 . The Kind of Man Needed . To the Editor of The New York Times : On behalf of myself and friends I desire to express my deep appreciation of the reference made in your editorial . article of recent date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent Presidential timber . Such a. man is sorely needed at this time to lead the American people as custodian of their thought , without reference to party affiliation . He is entirely free from entanglements , often developing into obligation , usually accompanying a seeker of office . It is quite seldom a man of such poise enters public life . He has never sought political office . His service as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates , and after as a member of Congress , was the result of spontaneous demand emanating from his fellow-citizens . As Amdassador to the Court of St. James 's he has not only acquitted himself most nobly , but he has shown extraordinary ability and tact in discerning the responsibilities of that Important position . His grasp upon international affairs wholly unexcelled . The American people at this time are exceedingly anxious to select a President who possesses the requisite qualities for the embodiment of their wishes . The character of the American spirit , as demonstrated under the leadership of President Wilson during the World War , proves its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership of the moral and commercial progress of the world . Should Mr. Davis be chosen as President , I am sure the beautiful character of the American spirit will be preserved and quickly restored to the high esteem in which it was held by all of the family of nations during the World War and the conference at Versailles . CHARLES E. W. SMITH . New York , May 28 , 1920 . " Too Good to be True ? " I have been reading communications addressed to you , as well as your own editorial comment , suggesting the nomination of John W. Davis for President by the Democratic Convention , to be held next month , and I am free to say that , in my opinion , such a nomination would add most materially to the prospects of Democratic resurrection at tho election to be held in November next . The Chicago Evening Post has described Mr. Davis in these words : " He is Just an efficient , cultured American . " But I am a little at a loss to understand how far that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those now flatulently proclaiming the qualifications that a Democratic candidate for the Presidency must necessarily possess in order to Conclusively Prove his Democracy . How far the qualities conceded to belong to Mr. Davis will appeal to the Prohibitionists , Populists , Socialists , I. W. W. 's , Bolshevik ! , anarchists and other " single-track " minds of our electorate of course I can not foretell ; but it will be admitted , I think , that large elements of these diorderly people have , barnaclelike , fastened themselves upon the Democratic Party , and , to a greater or lesser degree , have had their halide upon its steering gear . While I am still hopeful that wisdom will finally prevail at the Democratic Convention , nevertheless I have some doubt ; and 1 am furthermore possessed of the idea that Mr. Davis is " too good to be true . " WILLIAM B. ELLISON . New York , May 28 , 1920 . The Qualities Needed . To the Editor of The New York Times : It was gratifying to read your editorial article setting forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis for President in your issue of Sunday , May 23 . It has been gratifying to note the response evoked . I have no doubt that many of the conservative , thoughtful men and women of the country have felt that none of the candidates so far presented by either party measures up to the standard that present conditions require , The next President should have all of the high and fin- qualities attributed to Mr. Davis , and should furthermore be able to rise and stand firmly above those partisan bickerings and dickerings which have tended to dwarf some who might otherwise have been worthy and which befog , delay and thwart the true intent and purpose of the nation . Never before has it been more important that we have a President who can see clearly through these things and lead us to that high position in world affairs which will maintain our prestige and dignity and uphold our traditions in the new era now dawning .
