Not a few young U. S. citizens aspired last week to the publicity , if not the glory , achieved by Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh and his emulators , Messrs . Chamberlin and Levine ( see above ) . In Newark , N. J. , one aspirant , Alvin ( " Shipwreck " ) Kelly affixed a restaurant stool to the top of a 50-foot flagpole rising atop the St. Francis Hotel , then sat down on the seat . <P> Mr. Kelly 's theory was that if he thus roosted in mid-air for eight days his reward would be great. * Meanwhile he reaped a small reward by displaying from his stool a banner with the stark device : Baby Peggy at Loew 's State Theatre . <P> Mrs. Kelly , 19 , aggressive and redhaired , ministered to her husband from the base of the flagpole by a system of hoisting cords . She recalled to newsgatherers that he won the nickname " Shipwreck " after surviving the Titanic disaster ( 1912 ) , then entered the U. S. Navy , and , after the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer and " marathon rooster . " <P> " He knows what he 's doing , " said Mrs. Kelly . " Why should I worry ? " <P> In St. Louis , Mo. , last January , Mr. Kelly roosted for the record period of seven days and one hour - much of the time amid chill , sleet and snow . The experience thus gained caused him to make elaborate preparations before climbing aloft last week . <P> Forty-eight hours before ascending he ceased to take solid food . Moreover he has trained himself to sleep for ten minutes every hour on his stool . Lest he topple off while asleep , his thumbs are thrust tightly into holes bored in the eight-inches-in-diameter wooden seat . <P> As he roosted , last week , Mrs. Kelly passed up to him bottles of milk , broth , coffee-but no solid food . Any surplus he poured down a pipe running alongside the flagpole . He smoked , per day , approximately four packages of cigarets . Cheery , he called down to reporters : " After 48 hours of this you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stopping to crane their necks backward at Mr. Kelly , loitered a moment longer to argue with one another whether or not he is a hero . Some went home and read from Webster 's Dictionary : " Hero ... a person of distinguished ... fortitude in suffering . . . . " That seemed to cover Marathon Rooster Kelly . <P> <P> * A " Big Time " vaudeville producer promised him $1,000 a week , in the event of success .
