The world production of cotton for the year 1923-1924 , according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture , will be about 18,900,000 bales . This compares with 18,154,000 bales the preceding year . <P> For the 11 months ending May 31 , exports of cotton from the United States ran about 600,000 bales ahead of those for the year preceding , on better British and European demand . Nearly half this increase is due to larger British purchasing . <P> Meanwhile , the abnormally high prices for cotton are stimulating production in foreign countries . Egypt is expected to increase its cotton acreage 10% . Heavier planting is also expected in the Sudan and Uganda , whose potential acreage is estimated at about 2,250,000 acres . Among South American countries , Brazil has taken the lead as a cotton producer , yet Argentina has 14,000,000 acres available for the crop . But all these new cotton territories face serious difficulties . In the upper African districts , irrigation is the problem . In Brazil , the cotton area is in the interior valleys where transportation is poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insect pests and high freight rates . Extensive areas in Sind and Punjab ( India ) will require irrigation before cotton can be grown there sucessfully . <P> Nevertheless , the present high prices are a huge incentive in the attempt to overcome these difficulties of producing cotton abroad . Unless the American planter can overcome the ravages of the boll weevil , increase production and thus lower prices to something nearer a normal level , he will in a few years begin to encounter stiffer foreign competition than ever before in cotton production .
