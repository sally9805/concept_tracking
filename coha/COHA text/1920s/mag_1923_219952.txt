A new January record for railroad traffic was set this year according to the report of the Bureau of Railway Economics . The total traffic was 37 , 668,000,000 net ton miles . This is not only a new high record for January- usually a poor month because of weather conditions-but exceeds the record of every month in 1921 , and all but two months in 1922 . The factors in the increase are not easily separated . Mild January weather was doubtless a contributing factor . So was a general improvement of business conditions . If the unusual January record should be followed by similar high records for the Spring and Summer months , it may materially influence the decision of Congress in regard to the railroads during the next Winter session .
