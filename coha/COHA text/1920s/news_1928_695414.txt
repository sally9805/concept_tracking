txt Some months ago when money was easy , stocks were advancing and borrowing on call had reached large proportions as indicated by the volume of brokers ' loans , the Federal Reserve Board in Washington was besought in these columns to refrain from attempting to regulate stock speculation . It had already begun something of the kind and the step it had taken was bound to have exactly the reverse effect of what the Reserve Board 's advisers expected . No doubt with the best intentions in the world the Reserve Board advanced the discount rate in New York at a time when nothing of the kind was needed . There could be no iVbjection to such an advance if the member banks compelled it . But advancing the discount rate in New York so far from reducing the volume of money lending on call in the open market had the effect of attracting more money to this center . A speculator in stocks is not scared at the difference between 5 and 6 per cent . per annum or even 7 per cent as the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as The Wall Street Journal foresaw . A clumsy and ignorant hand had been thrust into the delicate machinery of credit . Not merely had the Federal Reserve Board mistaken its function : it showed that it knew little or nothing of the principles of banking . It forced $400,000,000 of securities held by the banks upon the market at a time when the market for new issues was already congested . Its ignorant meddling , in that inordinate desire to extend bureaucratic control which Is the curse of this country , came at the worst possible moment It is probably true that money was due to harden somewhat after a long period of ease . The immense conversion of floating capital into fixed forms had to make its effect felt sooner or later . But the Federal Reserve Board demoralized the entire situation . When the Secretary of the Treasury pays 41i- per cent . for short time loans with a government credit morally at 3 , , per cent it is obvious that the money market has been spoiled . It is not the Wall Street speculation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the commercial and industrial borrowers all over the country who are making time loans over the end of the year at 7 per cent . Even with all our experience of Federal Trade Board meddling , United States Shipping Board squander , Interstate Commerce Commission fumbling , could there be a worse example of the injury to business through the meddling of ignorant and incompetent officials ? The tightening of money is not a worldwide movement for the Bank of England rate remains at 4 , - per cent. , and that of the Bank of France is unperturbed . It is the business of the United States which has been embarrassed and impeded in this deplorable way . There is an old Latin phrase which says " quis custodiet custodes " ? who will guard these guardians ? Who will regulate our regulators who seem only dimly conscious of the mess they have made ? " A girl 's life is one long race to get married , - says a writer . Often she hopes she is on her last lap .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
