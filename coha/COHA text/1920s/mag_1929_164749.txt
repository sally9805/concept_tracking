Last week revivals of three greatly successful plays opened in Manhattan : <P> <P> Abraham Lincoln was written by John Drinkwater to interpret its hero for the English . Thousands of U. S. citizens saw it in Manhattan a decade ago , many went two and three times . Frank McGlynn still looks like Lincoln , makes him a compassionate and credible figure from his rustic days at law until the dark moment when John Wilkes Booth creeps toward the door of the red-plush Presidential box . <P> A Tailor-Made Man . Grant Mitchell returns as John Paul Bart , the socially-soaring pants-presser who. despite his outmoded slang ( twelve years ) is still very funny . <P> Naughty Marietta is that lovely effort of Victor Herbert which contains the waltz " I 'm Falling in Love with Someone . " Use Marvenga 's voice is as lissom as her figure . The third of a series of Victor Herbert revivals ( TIME , Oct. 7 ) , it is splendidly recreated in every detail .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
