txt Both the Hylan and anti-Hylan forces are now going through an elaborate farce . They gravely announce that they are making a careful and scientific study of public feeling about the Mayoralty in all parts of the city . Newsboys in the Bronx have reported a tremendous popular demand for the Mayor 's renomination . Their figures cover less than one-tenth of 1 per cent . of the voting population of that borough , but this should not make them any less portentous and conclu-. sive . It is solemnly stated also that a recent importation from Oregon , who is now an ardent Hylan supporter , has discovered the sentiment in New York favorable to the Mayor ; to be perfectly overwhelming , almost cataclysmic . For an old resident to question such an authority would obviously be to prefer local knowledge to information coming from afar where rolls the Oregon and hears no sound save its own dashing . The Tammany inquest is conducted with more geographical detail , but is equally calculated to make the judicious , or the hardened , smile . Large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly districts . The bulletins from the leaders are received with all the gravity befitting election returns . " Only trifling support for HYLAN in the Seventh . " " In the Twenty-first , ninetenths of the voters are sick of the Mayor . " " Even if he were nominated , the Mayor could not carry the Fourth District . " Such compartmenting of public feeling recalls the enterprising newspaper which at the time of President GARFIELD 'S death came out with a classification of grief all over the country ? " Sorrow in Pennsylvania , " " Sympathy in Maine , " and so on9 The richest part of the fun is that these political investigators know perfectly well that they get just what they ask for . A wink from the boss is just as good as an argument or a long table of statistics . " Anything doing for the Mayor in your election district , Bill ? " " Not a thing . " That settles it . In sober fact , as we all know , no marked sentiment of any sweeping kind has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy about their own affairs or planning vacations to give much thought to the subject . Any one who sets out to ascertain their preferences is very like a small boy throwing a tennis ball against a wall and having it bounce right back to him . One set of facts , however , has been brought out by the Hearst newspapers which no political analyist can afford to overlook . They have detected a great number of Rolls-Royce automobiles stopping in front of Judge Or. - VAXY 'S house or parked in front of his law offices . And a suspicious number of gentlemen in high hats and silk stockings have been observed going in and out This is terrible , and something drastic would have to be done about it , unless it were possibly based on an error of observation . The Rolls-Royce machines and the silk stockings and the high hats may have belonged to the rich friends of the Mayor whom he has put on his municipal Reception Committee or has made Deputy Commissioners of Police .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
