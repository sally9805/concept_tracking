Monsignor Anton Koroshetz was until recently Prime Minister of Jugoslavia . <P> Last week King Alexander , who recently assumed the powers of a dictator ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) , appointed the Rt . Rev. Anton Koroshetz to be the Minister Plenipotentiary of Jugoslavia to the new Papal State . <P> Thus the Monsignor-Minister is a most interesting personage . His duties will cause him to move in three spheres , fortunately separate and distinct . In the sphere of the Pope temporal-that is to say on the streets of the Papal State , mingling with the temporal subjects of the Pope-he will move as a foreigner , a Jugoslav . In the sphere of the Pope spiritual he already has his being as a native . In the temporal sphere of King Alexander , he remains a loyal subject .
