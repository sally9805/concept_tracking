B RITAIN 'S elections revealed a mood which was a strange combination of America 's moods of 1920 and of 1922 . England turned down Mr. Lloyd George with as heavy a thud as the United States turned down Mr. Wilson in 1920 . Mr. Bonar Law preached a policy of " tranquillity " as comfortably as Mr. Harding preached normalcy in 1920 , and England showed the same readiness to exchange the exciting and eccentric brilliance of Lloyd George for the dull but safe conservatism of Mr. Sonar Law as this country showed two years ago to exchange Mr. Wilson 's enthusiasm for interesting but spineless crusades for Mr. Harding 's promise of mediocrity and a middle course . But Britain in 1922 also showed something of the adventuresome independence which characterized our American elections in the Middle West this year . She made the Labor Party the second party in Parliament . The voters lustily bespoke their enthusiasm for men who had dared to stand by their pacifist convictions in war time . C. P. Trevelyan , who resigned from the Asquith Cabinet rather than share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly returned as a Labor Party candidate  --  he was a Liberal before the war  --  from Newcastle-upon-Tyne . Philip Snowden , Ramsay Macdonald , Arthur Ponsonby , Noel Buxton , George Lansbury  --  the stalwart internationalists of the old Independent Labor Party  --  will strengthen His Majesty 's Opposition in the new Parliament . And E. D. Morel , one of the bravest of the bold little group who held the banner of truth high throughout the war , actually led Winston Churchill , the fire-eating ex-Secretary of War , imperialistin-chief for all the new British dominions , by nearly 10,000 votes in Dundee ! Sir Hamar Greenwood , the Georgian who was chiefly responsible for the Black-and-Tan excesses in Ireland , was roundly trounced . Indeed , the electors showed plainly that they had small enthusiasm for any of the precious crew that led them through the war . Arthur Henderson , Labor member of the Cabinet , 1916-1918 , lost . Mr. Asquith himself had a close time at Paisley , and Mr. Bonar Law found Glasgow rougher sledding than he had dreamed . The Conservatives have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are actually a minority in the country . Fear of so great a majority that the old power of the House of Lords might be restored proved groundless . And , just as La Follette and Borah sit among the Republicans here , so Lord Robert Cecil , Henry Bentinck , and other Liberals-at-heart class themselves as Conservatives in England . There will be no great change in policy . Lord Curzon is Dreign Minister again ; the chief difference is that the ? aromatic interventions of his former chief are at an end . urzon is no democrat ; he believes in tortuous tractations , at at least he knows which is Upper and which Lower ilesia , as Mr. Lloyd George did not . What is to follow the Conservative regime ? That is the uestion which stirs men 's minds in England today . Engand is as certain that Bonar Law 's comfortable dulness is only a stop-gap as Americans have come to be that the Harding normalcy can not last . There seemed , before the election , to be three possibilities : a return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Lloyd George , with his forty-six followers in the new Parliament , is a defeated man ; his shiftiness has received a thorough burial . For all his newspaper Peers , he is done . Asquithian Liberalism seemed another possibility . There is a staunch tradition of genuine Liberalism in England . But these elections have shown that it needs new leaders . Mr. Asquith led his country into war . Neither he nor Sir Edward Grey can ever again command real enthusiasm . Middle-of-the-road Liberalism is out of fashion the world over ; it is the very bone of British tradition , but it is a casualty of the war . So the Labor Party has come into its own as the leader of the Opposition . It won 59 seats in December , 1918 ; it won more than 140 this year . Its four and a quarter million votes were more than both wings of the Liberals combined could poll , and a proportional system of representation would give it an even larger Parliamentary strength than it has . England has made it plain that to wishy-washy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars of prestige in the Near East , ready to recognize Soviet Russia de facto and de jure at once , pledged to nationalization of the coal mines and to a capital levy to meet the tax burden at home , and resolutely opposed to domination of either foreign or domestic policy by financial interests . How did the Labor Party reach this position ? Years of unremitting hard work lie behind it . Undoubtedly one of its greatest assets was the fact that in all the post-war crises it has fought the possibility of new foreign wars . It fought intervention in Russia ; it alone stood out against Mr. Lloyd George 's appeal to plunge into a new war against Turkey . Its leaders have understood the interrelationship of Europe and have preached a policy of reconciliation . At home it has been anti-protectionist . It has had a tax policy of its own . Indeed , one of the most significant things about this great party has been its readiness to use the intellectuals to help it formulate its program . It has absorbed the truly liberal Liberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has maintained the firm economic basis which its reliance upon the trade unions has given it , and yet has not intolerantly confined itself to manual workers . Its program has recognized that the term " worker " includes most of the population of any modern country . And it has left a large measure of autonomy to its local branches . Its strength is the strength of federation , built from below . In these circumstances , we believe , lies an important lesson for the coming third party in America . If it does not shun the fake liberals who are now talking of joining it , and erstwhile Progressives such as Medill McCormick and Albert J. Beveridge , it will lose its footing and be carried away in a vague stream of personal politics . The real strength of the new movement in the West is that it is a real farmer-labor movement , with its roots in the soil . The railroad unions played a significant part in giving La Follette his thundering majority in Wisconsin ; the votes of the railroad unions , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typographers , and other unions in favor of independent political action , indicate that the time is at last ripe for a national movement in this country which would be our American parallel  --  with more emphasis upon an agricultural program  --  to the British Labor Party movement . For such a movement to succeed , the liberal political leaders of today , like the true-blue Liberals in England , must be ready to give up the prestige of the old parties and frankly throw in their lot with the new alliance of the producing classes . Anti-War Men Reelected N 0 more significant fact stands out in the American election results than the return to public life of men who were driven from it because they refused to vote for war with Germany and stood upon their historic American right , almost unquestioned in any other war in which this country ever engaged , to dissent from its war policy . The outstanding case is that of former Congressman Clarence C. Dill of Washington , to which we called attention last week . He voted in the House against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had told his constituents he would do if war threatened , and for doing so he was , in the succeeding hysteria and passion , driven out of public life . When he declared his candidacy for United States Senator this year people scoffed . He won the nomination and then faced Senator Poindexter , so long a popular Progressive statesman that no one dreamed that he was beatable . During the campaign , Mr. Dill 's anti-war record was cited against him . He gloried in it . He would say to the voters : " I promised you that I would do my best to keep this country out of war unless it was in danger of invasion . I kept faith with you , did I not ? And I was punished for it . I am here today again for your votes , not regretting or withdrawing those sentiments . " Curiously enough , this avowal was always followed by such applause that the opposition newspapers which had at first dwelt upon his " un-American conduct " found it convenient to forget about it . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be its youngest member as he is but thirty-eight years old . Wisconsin has done more than return La Follette , who voted against the war and openly opposed it . Congressmen Cooper and Browne of that State , who were defeated , respectively , in 1918 and 1920 , because of their attitude on the war were this year renominated and reelected . Congressman Berger did not have the chance to vote against the war , as he would like to have had , but he has been elected for the third time since the beginning of the war , and it is an interesting fact that the indictments against him in two United States courts in Wisconsin for his alleged violation of the espionage laws have been dismissed since his reelection . The Supreme Court long ago reversed the conviction secured in Judge Landis 's prejudiced court . In Ohio General Isaac R. Sherwood , the 87-year-old pacifist , who is also a veteran of the Civil War , has rewon his seat in Congress after having been ousted because he could not without protest see his country commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we have also reported , the newly chosen Senator Burton K. Wheeler , who during the war was viciously charged with sympathy with sedition , found his record a help and not a hindrance . Congressman Evans of that State has been reelected on a platform calling for disarmament and a referendum before any declaration of war . His conscience troubles him , he says , because he is no longer sure that he voted right when he cast his ballot for war on that fatal April 5 . Mrs. Winifred Mason Huck , of Illinois , is another newly elected member of Congress who favors a war referendum , as do La Follette and numerous others . As in England , the tide is turning with the electorate . And with the return to public life of men and women who will stand against war , there comes new hope of outlawing the most damnable and the foulest of human institutions . Another Kansas City Star W HO can fail to thrill to the news that a fifteen-yearold girl , Marion Talley , sang the other day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wisest of music patrons , and amazed them all by the beauty and range of her voice ? From Kansas City she came , attended by a retinue of family and friends , to stand before the footlights as unmoved by the critics beyond them as if Trilby the hypnotized . Nor was there any elation when the ordeal was successfully over ; the day 's work was done and the next thing was to get ready to go back home . Aid ? None was needed . For once the rich patrons of the musical arts were not to be appealed to ; their verdict could be rendered without dread of resulting liabilities . For there were two Kansas City lawyers in the party , neither wild enthusiasts nor men bent upon a sentimental journey . " Just plain , hard-boiled lawyers , " they called themselves , who had come with Marion to get the most critical of judgments upon her . With them were the two women who will go down to fame as " they who discovered Marion Talley . " Money ? No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs no help from any metropolis ; just before she left a woman 's club sent her a check , and there are plenty more to be had . So , when the day comes upon which Marion makes her debut in the Metropolitan and the house sways with cheers and the footlights are piled high with flowers torn from corsages in the boxes and flung at the feet of youth , beauty , and talent triumphant , Kansas City will be there , the " hard-boiled " lawyers , the women who first heard , saw , and knew , the parents who , all unwitting , brought another prodigy into the world , and the rest of the town even unto third and fourth cousins . No one person shall claim the credit then , but Kansas City itself , bursting with pride of ownership . The same " burg " at which the effete East has so long scoffed , that has boasted of its Star paper , of its stockyards , its forest of wholesale houses , its cowboys on the streets , its brand-new boulevards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the world " that it found and treasured a greater than Mary Garden and Geraldine Farrar combined : " When it comes to genius , oh , boy , our little town do n't take second place to none ! " Fortunate prodigy ! Fortunate city ! Marion 's is not to be the rough road of child genius " shut up in that room in company with scales and arpeggios and a heart as full of wishes as that blue sea yonder full of gay white sails . " Pity all prodigies , it used to be , those pitiful little slaves driven by a lash , exploited by parents , plundered of youth and education that the day of money-making might come soon . There was Paganini , first of the virtuosi , six years younger than Marion when he startled the world , but already bent , misshapen , and distorted by ten hours of fiddling a day , deprived of food whenever he made the slightest mistake or craved an hour of freedom to live and play and smile . Surely now it will be Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debenture bonds , if need be . And the best of play , the best of food , and the best of teaching , and wonderful cities to see , and all the artists in the world to hear . For her the path to success , straight and clear and even . For us once more the greatest of Nature 's marvels and riddles . Why Kansas City and not Juneau ? Why Marion and not Alice , or Grace , or Mary , or Jane ? Out of what ether , by what wireless , whence the divine spark ? The Last First Americans I F the Bursum Indian Bill passes the House , as it has passed the Senate , the State of New Mexico in particular ( for three Santa Fe lawyers claim credit for it ) and the United States in general will have enacted the doom of the Pueblo Indians . They are the last American Indians whose civilization and culture have persisted to the present day in anything like their fine primitive form  --  a precious heritage and asset to the country at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zunis , do not live on government reservations but in small , isolated tribal groups massed in communal adobe villages , scattered north and south for a hundred and fifty miles along the Rio Grande , from Taos to Albuquerque and thence westward into the desert , nearly to the Arizona line . They have , so far as the memory of man carries , been a peaceful race of farmers and craftsmen ; a race infinitely more closely attached to and bred into a particular piece of soil than even such French racial and cultural units as the Bretons and the Alsatians . A Taos Pueblo is quite as different from a Zuni as a Breton from an Alsatian Frenchman , in custom , dress , language , even in the method of wearing his long hair . The first white men who came to the Southwest , the Spanish priests and generals , made no attempt to eject the diverse tribes from the fruitful tracts of irrigated land where they were found . On the contrary , the Spaniards affirmed and confirmed the rights of every tribal unit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , generally measured a league each way from the pueblo church , containing about 17,000 acres  --  a grant inalienable and held in common . It is the claims against these original Spanish land grants , the purchase grants which were legally added to them by the various Pueblo tribes , and the water rights pertaining to both that are chiefly in question in the Bursum bill . In taking over New from old Mexico , our Government formally confirmed to the Pueblos the rights held under the Spanish Crown and to every tribe gave for its land a patent in fee simple , communally held . The original document , signed by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 , is the most treasured possession of each Pueblo tribe . Even before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo there had been encroachments on Indian land , and ever since , year by year , in almost every Pueblo grant , especially in the northern jurisdiction , acreage has been reduced by the intrusion of non-Indian squatters until in the pueblo of Picuris  --  to cite examples  --  only forty irrigated acres of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in the pueblo of San Juan outsiders are in possession of 3,412 of the 4,000 irrigable acres  --  leaving only 588 acres to yield a living to 432 Indians . Yes , an island of irrigated land surrounded by a ditch is a rather valuable thing in the desert , and why should a red man in a blanket have a claim to it anyhow ? What if his ancestors did grub the soil and dig the ditch ? Better men are now at hand . Some such reasoning , conscious or unconscious , has prevailed in the New Mexico courts  --  the courts of a pioneer territory and a pioneer State , where the juries have chiefly consisted of the friends of the claimants . The Bursum bill perpetuates and legalizes the unsquare deal . Every section of the bill is unfavorable to the Indians , favorable to those who claim against them . Some final adjustment of the claims must , to be sure , be made , in the interest of both Indians and non-Indians . Some of theencroachments rest on seventy-five or more years of occupancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule and in the early territorial days many Indians holding individual sections of Pueblo land ( by custom , not by law ) sold or bartered or gave pieces of land to Spanish-American settlers . The descendants of such settlers , or those who have bought from them in good faith , have equal rights in equity , if not in law , with the Indians . Only in 1913 did the Federal Supreme Court ( Sandoval case ) establish that the Pueblos were wards of the Government , with no legal right to sell an acre of their land . But when the bill proposes to accept as prima facie evidence of boundaries of claims against the Indians the survey made by the Indian Office in 1914 to determine what persons were on the land , not to establish boundaries , and to compensate the Indians from hypothetical public irrigable land adjacent to the pueblos , or else with moneys to be obtained from non-specified sources and administered by the Secretary of the Interior ; when it proposes to confirm the ownership of all those who have squatted since 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United States District Court and administered by the Secretary of the Interior ( who happens now to be the familiar Mr. Fall ) ? that means that the very men whose duty it is to protect the Pueblos are selling them out . Land outside of the pueblo boundaries , even if such land be obtainable , is no substitute to the Pueblo Indian for his own lands inside the pueblos , and the permanent intrusion of non-Indian settlers into the heart of his communal life is destructive to his sacred institutions . The bill has other bad features . In New Mexico the ditch is the life-stream of the land . The Bursum bill seriously limits Pueblo water rights , thereby placing an embargo on growth in progress and population . It encourages litigation about land and water between Indians and non-Indians and even throws into the Federal Court disputes between rival factions within the Pueblo tribe . The questions raised in the Bursum bill are neither Republican nor Democratic , and it is most unfortunate that they have taken on the color of a political and racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely Spanish-American Republican voters . Opposition to the bill should be nation-wide and party-free unless America wishes to see the Pueblo civilization die within the next ten years . The tribes which are still primitively vigorous are those , like Santo Domingo , or Zuni ( on its reservation ) , where there has been little or no encroachment ; the tribes that are dead or dying , like Pojoaque , Picuris , Nambe , are those which have been unable to prevent non-Indian elements from creeping like a net about their communal villages . Congress should kill the Bursum bill and devise instead some measure , perhaps a Court of Private Land Claims , which will finally establish rights and boundaries in a manner fair to all . If our Government could be moved to spend a few hundreds of thousands of dollars on water storage and pumpage , so that more of the now barren tracts included in the Pueblo lands could be put under irrigation , then the settlers might be left in possession of many of their present holdings and the Pueblos still be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans , and to pursue their beautiful handicrafts in peace .
