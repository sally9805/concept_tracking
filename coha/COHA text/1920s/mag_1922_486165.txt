Two Major Novelists The Goose Man . By Jacob Wassermann . Authorized translation by Allen W. Porterfield . Harcourt , Brace and Company . $2.50 . Ditte : Towards the Stars . By Martin Anderson Nexii . Translated by Asta and Rowland Kenney . Henry Holt and Company . $2 . OF the many novels of Jacob Wassermann , the present re-viewer has read only the two published in America , but these are sufficient to make it evident that Wassermann 's name may be mentioned without too much apology with the names of some of the greater Russians . It is true that neither " The World 's Illusion " nor " The Goose Man " is the equal of " Crime and Punishment " or " The Idiot , " but there is enough similarity to suggest the comparison and not enough disparity of merit to make it ridiculous . Like Dostoevski , Wassermann belongs with those men who have descended into the hell of poverty and want and who have brought back with them a vision of life which is as fascinating as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope and rapidly changing scene is striking , but it is not this form so much as it is the intensity of his spiritual ardor which makes him remarkable . Few contemporary novelists are capable of giving the reader an emotional experience equally powerful . " The Goose Man " like " The World 's Illusion " is the story of a suffering Titan  --  this time a musician  --  and the end is again renunciation and a sort of absorption into the vile mass of humanity which Wassermann clasps to his breast with the paradoxical loathing-love of the Russians . Daniel Nothaff , born in destitution , belongs to the race of Brand and Zarathustra in his devotion to impossible perfection . He leads his life in misery and wretchedness , at first because of the meanness and stupidity of the people around him , and then later because in his egotistical devotion to an ideal of perfection he scorns all who would help and proclaim him for his works which are nothing to him because they are not ultimate . He lives aloof from life , and the brutality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rest of the world in bringing misery to all with whom he is concerned , and finally at one swoop are destroyed all the accumulated manuscripts of his tortured years . Then in the final and most powerful section of the whole novel his guardian angel , the Goose Man statue of Nuremberg , appears to counsel and comfort him . " If you had only lived , " says the Goose Man , " really and truly lived , Life would have got the best of you , but your love would have been real , the hate you experienced real , your misfortunes real , the lies , ridicule , and betrayal all real , and the shadows of those who have died from you would have taken on reality . Eliminate from your mind now , forever and completely , the delusion that you have borne the sufferings of the world ! You have merely borne your own sufferings , loving-loveless , altruistic-egoist , monster , man without a country that you are . " The labors of Daniel 's tortured life have , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . They have been no achievement , but they have been an expiation , and now that they are completed and destroyed he is free . " I speak to you as Christ , " says the Goose Man . " Rise and go in peace , Daniel ! Go with me to my place . ( The market-place . ) Be me for just one day , from morning to evening , and I will be you . " Daniel is absorbed into life . One has known all along that some such conclusion was inevitable , but so admirably is it worked out that the reader is swept away . As a whole " The Goose Man " is not so good as " The World 's Illusion " and it is by no means so well translated but nothing in the former book surpasses this last section . It arouses in the reader that tumult and exaltation which only great art can produce . The world through which Daniel moves is the nightmare world of the Russians , with avarice , baseness , stupidity , and pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Saxon does not readily accept so hellish a vision but he can understand the circumstances which produced it and feel its horrible power . Like Dostoevski , Wassermann sees things with a sort of insane intensity which only an analogy can explain . Whoever has driven an automobile at night has been terrified by the world which its headlight revealed . Direct dazzling light cuts into the perfect black and throws objects into unrelieved outline . The veriest puddle in the road becomes a jagged black abyss and the gentlest clump of shrubbery outlines itself against the dark with ominous clarity . One would fear , almost , to live in so stark a world , yet terrible as these aspects of the night are they are none the less real and it is with something of this demoniacal intensity that the vision of a Dostoevski or a Wassermann penetrates the gloom which surrounds him . Characters and incidents detach themselves with incredible emphasis and trail gigantic shadows behind them , forming a world more intense than any which we ordinarily see , but none the less real . Take for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blessed with a moderate fortune he spends his days in idleness , frequenting a certain cafe where he mingles , a man of mystery , with the impecunious artists and degenerates who frequent the place . Besides conversation , the newspaper is his chief solace and he loves sensational incident , jotting down inhis notebook from time to time bits like the following : " In Cochin China a tiger killed and ate fourteen children , and then , forcing its way into the bungalow of a settler , bit off the head of a woman as she was sleeping peacefully beside her husband . " No doubt he seems a harmless man enough to the people who meet him day by day , but Wassermann turns his light upon him and he becomes a monster , gloating voluptuously over the miseries of the starving poets and painters of the cafe and luxuriating in the calamities reflected in the newspapers , " his mind a storehouse of fearful and ferocious happenings , an inventory of disease , seduction , theft , robbery , larceny , assassination , murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is , says Wassermann , a Nero of our day , " a Nero without servants , without power , without land , " and as we see him sitting at his piano pouring out his impotent rage in music we accept him as such a monster indeed . Only the author 's cruel experiences can explain the cruelty of his vision of the world . To us who occupy in comparative safety our little niche in existence , the men and things about us seem kindly or at least indifferent because they have relatively little power to harm us , but the destitute get a different view . What is to us indifference becomes to them malignancy , and what merely passes us by rises to crush them . We get a vision of life different from theirs because we see it from a different angle , we looking down upon it , so to speak , and they looking up as it tramples over their prostrate body . It is no wonder that the car of Juggernaut looks heaviest to those whose limbs it has crushed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation , but it too must be accepted as a characteristic phenomenon . The idea of redemption through degradation which runs through Russian fiction and is the keynote of Wassermann as well , has to our minds an element of the grotesque , and it seems to us a sort of perversity to search for one 's idealism in the gutter . Yet there certain mystics who have given the tone to a whole school of modern fiction have found it , and sneer as the apostles of healthy-mindedness may , their philosophy has a spiritual reality . Wassermann must be put down as another who has gone the paradoxical way and learned the lesson of love in the contemplation of human depravity . In superficial outline the lives of Wassermann and Martin Anderson Nex6 seem similar , for Nexd also was compelled at a very early age to shift for himself , working first as a farm boy , then as a shoemaker on a fourteen-hour day , and still later as a hod-carrier . Yet similar as the careers were in outline , there was either something bitterer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more resilient nature , for the stream of his narrative runs clear . " Pelle the Conqueror " and " Ditte " are both , like the two novels of Wassermann , stories of the development of a single great soul , but there is about the two former a directness and simplicity which contrasts markedly with the tortured aspect of the German novels . " Ditte : Towards the Stars " brings to a conclusion the " Ditte " trilogy which now takes its place beside the four volumes of " Pelle , " the two works constituting a twin epic of low-class life  --  the one being the story of man the worker , and the other the story of woman the mother . As in the last volume of " Pelle " so in this last volume of the other series , the sociological note is struck again and again , for Nexii has strong convictions , but he is too fine an artist to make thesis rather than character the backbone of his novel . Sociology runs only as an undercurrent , and it is the magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first two volumes described the rise of a perfect peasant type , tracing Ditte 's life as she passes into service on a farm and from thence to the city and describing her first love ; the third volume now recounts her decline . As her magnificent vitality declines she is enmeshed deeper and deeper in the cares of her family and the wretched struggle for existence against the powers of the social organization until she is brought finally to death . She achieves no material triumph and wins no conscious philosophy , for hers is not a thinking role . Hers are the virtues simply of magnificent vitality and a good heart and she pours them forth in the service of the children who fall to her care and upon all who are dependent upon her without thought or consciousness of her elemental heroism , laboring not because labor is a duty , but because labor is in her heart . Around this central figure Nexii makes revolve the whole drama of humble life , and his work is magnificently real and balanced because he has succeeded in picturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trilogy constitutes , if you like , an attack upon the social system based upon privilege and the arguments presented are powerful , but it is not so much this fact which constitutes the work 's greatness as it is the dignity which the characters assume and the full-blooded reality of the whole . The philosophy of Wassermann , with its gesture of renunciation , is a mystical religion ; that of Next ; is a healthy animalism . Shot through as his work is with sociology , it is upon human nature that his sociology would build , and his hope is in the magnificent health of the will to live and flourish which is embodied in Ditte . When she has come to the end of her journey she is buried in the potters ' field at the expense of the community . " That , " says Next ' , " was the only honor conferred on her in all of her life  --  and that was not done voluntarily . " " Did she , " he asks , " succeed in softening hearts ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the end is not despair . Ditte is the symbol of suffering humanity which can bear all things and to which , in consequence , all things are possible . J. W. KRUTCH Introducing Anthropology Early Civilization : An Introduction to Anthropology . By Alexander A. Goldenweiser . Alfred A. Knopf. $5 . T 0 open a book leading off with the caption Early Civilization and there to find the societies of the Eskimo , the Tlingit , Saida , and Iroquois Indians of North America , the Negroes of Uganda , and the Blackfellows of the Australian Bush presented as exemplary is certain to touch with mild shock one 's lexical prepossessions . Has , then , the word " civilization " nothing of the significance which usage has ascribed to it , as discriminating from savages and barbarians those races and peoples which have enlightenment in their tradition , and are aware of it ? Or is the word to go the way of " culture , " designating every level , not of refinement , but of want of it ? In Mr. Goldenweiser 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is religion , social and political organization , economic pursuits and industries and art ; there is ceremonialism , and leadership , and warfare ; there is barter and a tendency toward inheritance of privileges and commodities . " Accordingly , the Australian Bush and murder-ridden Uganda are in the same form with the British who police them , apparent discrepancies of estate being merely due to the failure of the blacks to actualize their potential gifts  --  for not only are all men civilized , but potentially all are equal , in Mr. Goldenweiser 's view . Most of us had supposed that civilization at least implied civic societies , conscious not only of their law but of their histories , and gifted with some instrument for the transmission of knowledge through measurable centuries . Inevitably distinctions of definition are difficult , but to empty " uncivilized " of meaning is no step toward anthropological , or other , science . One is given pause , too , touching the content of anthropology , to which science this volume purposes to give introduction . Unquestionably there is need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature is enormous and yearly accumulating ; the interest is alert . There is , again , as in all growing subjects , an uncomfortable vagueness of boundaries ; problems and limits are not set ; the anthropologist encroaches upon the historian and the archaeologist , upon the economist and the political scientist , upon the philologist , the psychologist , and the aesthetician , and even upon the biologist and geologist , of necessity making their problems his and viewing broad measures of their domains as subject to his more comprehensive science of man . Indeed , it is quite possible that the social sciences as a body , with some ancillary help from the natural sciences , will eventually coalesce into a larger unit under the banner of anthropology . Actually , however , in its modern intention , anthropology is a young science with reasonably clear foci , viz. , physical anthropology , descriptive ethnology , and the comparative study of religion and custom ; if folk-psychology is to be added to these it is because no field of learning , anent man , can be reasonably illumined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other animals . Mr. Goldenweiser 's conception of his science is not comprehensive . His book is divided into three parts . In the first he illustrates " early civilizations " with sketchy descriptions of the aboriginal American , African , and Australian groups above mentioned ; nothing from the continent which is called the Mother of Civilization ; nothing from the tradition whence Europe derives . The second part deals with Industry and Art , Religion and Society of Early Man , and the spotty examples which illustrate these great topics are mainly chosen from North American and Siberian examples , with digressions to the isles of the sea and the Dark Continent . Part three deals with the ideas of early man , passing in review the theories of Spencer , Frazer , Wundt , Freud , and others . Mr. Goldenweiser 's chief overt interest in all of these fields centers about the origin and dissemination of cultural traits , and reasonable methods of determining such processes ; and he reaches the common-sense conclusion  --  rather pompously put  --  that man 's native necessities , his natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must all be taken into account in explaining the facts . In doing this he performs the service of overriding a number of hobbies which have had some vogue in the literature of anthropology , if not beyond it . But certainly not this merit is sufficient to justify the title of introduction to anthropology to a book for which the problems of the physical character and ethnical distribution of the branches of the human race are non-existent and in which there is no hint of the fascinating variety of things human nor any scale which can assess their values . In one engaging respect Mr. Goldenweiser 's book presents an ulterior problem which itself might be termed anthropological . The author patently falls in with a certain trend of thinking for which social anthropology has a propaganda interest . Men 's minds have labored for near three-quarters of a century with a growing contradiction of their innermost convictions : the democratic assertion of the equality of men , which has passed beyond its classical signification of equality before the law into a proclamation of social and moral equivalence , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its emphases upon differences , fitness , higher and lower ; and the consequence has been an uncomfortable fission of our political and scientific beliefs . Naturally the social anthropologist has felt this most keenly , and he has evolved a curious doctrine of compromise , that of the " potential equality " of races , which is thrown , so to speak , in the face of the obvious racial differences of mankind . Essentially the doctrine is nonsense . Even the primitive races are alike ( as Mr. Goldenweiser 's own meager evidence shows ) only in the possession of the traits which mark them as human ; their differences , cultural and physical , are many . Nor is there any lessening of the absurdity when an undefined " potentiality " ( negatived both by biological and historical science ) is brought to the rescue of an indefinable " equality . " And to add to the moil , Mr. Goldenweiser stands stoutly for individual differences within the group as a vital factor in progress . Doubtless he is right ; individuals are superior and inferior ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher and lower according to their power of producing the better sort of men .
