Foreign nations have taken no little interest in the decision of the Supreme Court which forbids their vessels to carry liquor as part of their ship stores , or even under seal , when in United States waters . There was a storm of protest in the English and French press . <P> The English Government , with its usual deliberation , has done nothing , and probably will do nothing until its legal experts have examined the Supreme Court ruling . The French Government , more impetuous , had Ambassador Jusserand visit the State Department and talk with Secretary Hughes . It , too , will probably make no formal protest until it is evident what the United States actually purposes doing . French , Italian and Spanish law requires that seamen on ships of those nationalities have a daily liquor ration . So there will be a direct clash between the laws of at least three countries and that of the United States . Ambassador Jusserand pointed this out to Mr. Hughes . <P> The French are talking of retaliatory measures , and it is claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be kept out of French ports . Conferences of ship owners are taking place in England to decide on a concerted plan of action against the new prohibition ruling . It is suggested that foreign ships may call at Halifax instead of New York , or drop their liquors there and proceed to New York . It is also suggested that foreign vessels may station rum ships just outside the three-mile limit , leaving their liquors " on deposit " while they touch port . All these plans are more or less discounted as impracticable . <P> The English are inclined to admit the legal right of the United States to act in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court , at the same time protesting such action as unfair and discourteous . The French are more inclined to regard our action as an infraction of international law .
