A NATIVE ARGOSY-Morley Callaghan- Scribner 's ( $2.50 ) Last year Morley Callaghan of Canada wrote Strange Fugitive , and was promptly likened to Ernest Hemingway of Michigan for his brusque , compact style , intently modern . His characters , of middling low mentality ; his incidents , grim and macabre in their humor , smacked of contacts as a newspaper reporter . This year Author Callaghan furthers his reputation by a collection of stories , one of which-far from the best-was included in The American Caravan ( arty anthology ) . A better story is entitled " A Predicament , " and concerns a young priest disturbed at confessional by a drunk who thinks he is on a street car , and demands to be let off at the corner of King and Yonge . The young priest , sliding the panel between him and the drunk , recognizes the grating sound as the same noise made by the closing doors of a street car . Fearful of unseemly disturbance , uncertain what to do , he prolongs a confession at the women 's panel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little prayer whenever she feels she is going to lie . Then he turns to the other side of the confessional , hesitates , says three " Our Fathers " and three " Hail Marys , " and growls to the drunk : " Step lively there ; this is King and Yonge . Do you want to go past your stop ? " The drunk lumbers off . The priest looks forward to a sleepless night .
