Spy Cameras . To spy upon factories whose chimneys spew smoke in violation of municipal ordinances , President Harvey N. Davis of Stevens Institute of Technology last week recommended a long range camera which automatically registers on a long film a picture of everything in its purview , every 30 seconds for eight hours . Shrewd pryers at once thought of many another use for such a device . <P> Turtle . At Canton , Mo. , Mississippi river town quite like those which ingenious Huckleberry Finn knew , a snapping turtle paddled out of a sewer . To its tail was tied a cord . A man hauled at the cord until its end appeared . To that end was tied a rope . The man hauled at that rope and soon a scraper came dragging through the sewer . Thus Cantonese ingeniously cleanse their clogged conduits . <P> Herring Hearer . Rear-Admiral Henry P. Douglas of England 's navy last week revealed a cunning adaptation of the microphone used to detect the proximity of submarines during the War . Fifteen British steam trawlers use such microphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Electrolytic Iron Pipes . A way of making iron pipes cheaper than the usual casting process has been developed by Colin G. Fink , professor of electrochemistry at Columbia . He dissolves crude iron in acid and gets an electrolyte . Into the liquid he immerses a steel cylinder . Through cylinder and electrolyte an electric current goes . Pure iron breaks out of the electrolyte and adheres to the steel cylinder until by such electroplating an iron pipe is formed . Professor Fink avers that his electrolytic pipe is as strong as a cast pipe. + <P> + He has also developed chromium plating .
