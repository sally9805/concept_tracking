txt Contending that chain stores and fundamental changes in marketing methods have made the packers ' consent decree of 1920 useless . Armour &; Co. and Swift &; Co. filed a petition today in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia asking for a modification of the decree under which they , with other packers , consented to end their connection with all business save the meat industry . " The decree permits packers other than the four national packers and ether organizations to do things which the four national packers are prevented from doing , although they have the facilities for doing them economically . " said . F. Edson White .. president of Armour &; Co. , speaking for the packers in explaining their move . " This decree , therefore , itself creates unfair competition as between packer competitors not affected thereby and the packer defendants , a situation which the law- was ? enacted to prevent . ?

" One of them . he continued with 207.000 meat markets , owned two meat packing ' Plants and a sausage factory and the indications were that retail meat distribution was coming into the bands of food chain systems even more rapidly than was the case with groceries . " The decree , therefore , sets up an artificial discrimination between competitors by forbidding only four to do what all the others are allowed to do , " he added . Regarding changes in the marketing situation since the decree was filed , the petition says that chain food stores have grown since 1919 to 1.000 chains with 70,000 stores and sales exceeding $3.000.000,000 and that chain food stores do from 35 to 45 per cent of the nation 's grocery business .

Distribution Facilities Curtailed . Particular reference is made ' to the packers and stock yard act , which Congress passed in 1921 after the decree had been entered . This gives the Secretary of Agriculture jurisdiction over the business of packers and stock yards and makes disregard of his rulings a criminal of- fense . The petition . sets forth that the decree prevents the four packing groups from fully using their existing facilities for distribution , which ; it is asserted , means that the ? entire cost of maintaining branch houses and other facilities must be carried by the business ' in : meats and meat products instead of being shared by other products which , without additional expense , could be distributed through ' the ' same . channels if ' the decree allowed it .

These factors:prevent full efficiency in , distribution and cause an economic waste which is necessarily reflected in prices . " In general , the decree prevents the four national packers from handling any food products except meat and meat products , and from establishing retail meat markets . " the petition goes on . " It also forbids them to have an interest in stock yards or stock yard terminal railways , in addition to other less important restrictions . " One statement szts forth that the decree was entered into 1920 without trial , and expressly denies any violation of law or contemplated violation on the part of the four packers .

In 1920 the government instituted antitrust proceedings against a group of big packers , but did not push them when the packers consented to a decree divorcing them from . all lines of business not directly related to the meat packing industry . The Armour and Swift groups subsequently appealed , seeking to have the consent decree set aside . The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court , which sustained the government in its determination to enforce the decree . The California canneries , with a contract with the packers for handling its products , were permitted by the local courts here to intervene , and instituted suit to have the decree , which on its motion was suspended , set aside . The Supreme Court last Spring decided against the canneries and directed - the lower- : courts to give full effect to the decree .               @ @ @ @ @ @
