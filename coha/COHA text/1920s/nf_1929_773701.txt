The nature of these restrictions varies greatly from one social group to another , but they are nevertheless very real in all groups . Similarly , other urges and acquired response patterns in life limit the economic interest . The mating urge , parental desire , love of country , ambition to accomplish a given task , devotion to a cause , as , for example , to a trade union , or its opposite , may draw one away from the work , or the bargain that will yield the most money .

Furthermore , lack of knowledge and lack of ability or desire at a given moment to balance alternatives carefully often prevent a person from maximizing his economic interests . But when all of these elements are accounted for , the fact remains that most persons buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest one , for this does not usually involve the sacrifice of any of the non-economic interests of life . This means that the usual individual , in his economic transactions , is normally an economic man . He tries to make his money go as far as it will when he buys ? he tries to make his goods or his labor services fetch as high a price as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , to reemphasize what has just been said , it is only within limits that all other things are equal . Footnote // The exercise of economic self-interest , subject , of course , to restraining limits such as have been noted , has strong social justification . To choose carefully among the many offerings of merchants in order that clothing sufficient for an entire family may be secured , to buy the best automobile that may be bought for a given sum of money , to engage in that one among several equally reputable occupations that will yield the largest income , is not to do a belittling act . Indeed , conduct other than that has always been condemned by moralists . To the question as to why most men wish to make money , there are many answers . The procurement of the necessities , comforts , and luxuries of life for one 's self and dependents is vitally important to most men .

But with a great many people , the goal that they may easily set up and which they may make some show of attaining is that of a given economic income . The economic struggle in and of itself gives zest to life . IV . PREDATORY LABOR Most kinds of work are parts of the general cooperative endeavor of our economic life . At the same time that a person is making money for himself , he is usually performing a service for someone else . But it is not universally true that money-making and social service go together . Some persons are predatory in their economic activity ; they prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not assist in the common enterprise of making a living for the world . There are usually many persons in an economic society who // do not make their living . This is true of the young , the old , the infirm , and the idle rich , to mention only certain groups that get without giving . Such persons are parasites upon those who work , but not many of these could be said to prey upon their fellows . This is clearly true of children , and of those who are incapacitated for work . Those who may be called predatory laborers are , by definition , not idle . They work , but in working they do not render a service to their fellow men from whom comes their living . Such persons thus get without giving , although they may work very hard . It is difficult , if not impossible , to draw a sharp line between predatory and non-predatory , socially useful , labor . As among most phenomena of life , there are border line cases here that can not with certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work may be partly predatory and partly useful ; and , also , there may be differences of opinion as to whether a given line of activity is socially desirable . The purveyor of harmful drugs and narcotics , the seller of fraudulent securities , the attorney who secures freedom from prison for an anti-social person , are not performing socially desirable services ; they are predatory laborers . But what of the keeper of a gambling den , or of a " bookmaker " at a horse race ? If their only service is to assist some people to get money away from other people , for which they receive payment , they are surely predatory . But if patrons get enjoyment from the betting which these persons make possible are they not to some degree socially useful ? But even so , does the social gain outweigh the social loss ? If it does not , then the net results of the work of these persons is predatory . What of middlemen , advertisers , and stockbrokers ? A discussion of the work of these persons must be postponed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard the work which these persons do as being for the most part , at least , socially useful . But rather than attempting to determine what forms of economic activity are predatory , the present purpose is primarily to call attention to the fact that labor may be un- // productive of social utility . To effect such arrangements and to cultivate such desires among men that all labor will be socially useful is an ever-present task of citizenship . V. VARIOUS LABOR GROUPS The various labor groups in an economic society necessarily have conflicting interests . As any one group gains at the expense of the others it is relatively better off than it was . There is always danger that the labor group made up of employers will represent their interest as being the general social interest in cases of conflict with the wage-earning labor group ; and there is also always danger that the more vocal part of the general public , which is the more prosperous part , will express agreement with the employing group at such a time . The identification of one 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of any economic group . Thus the payment of high wages to day laborers may easily be regarded as socially ruinous by the groups whose economic position would thereby be made less fortunate . According to the democratic ideal , which prevails with us , a society becomes more ideal as the economic position of the lower labor group is improved . That is , as wages in the lower groups rise ? as the prices of labor service in the various groups become less unequal ? as it becomes less possible for the upper groups to employ corps of servants ? general social welfare is usually said to be upon a higher plane .

Footnote CHAPTER VII POPULATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES The natural resources at the disposal of the people are , clearly , a governing factor in their economic life . Not only is the nature of the work that they may do conditioned by the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product is dependent on the fertility of the resources . Fortunate indeed is a community that is possessed of a natural environment so varied as to furnish opportunity for the exercise of the many talents that tend to appear in a large group of individuals , and sufficiently fertile to permit a high standard of living . Trade Relations and Resources . ? In order that a high standard of living may be maintained , it is not necessary that the natural resources be sufficiently varied to furnish the many different goods that are desired . For , if the resources are fertile , then , even although they be limited to certain forms , it will be possible through trade relations with other regions to secure the complement of goods that the people of a community desire . If the natural resources should be limited almost exclusively to fish , for example , a people might , if the fish were sufficiently abundant , secure from other persons , in exchange for fish , enough goods to permit a high standard of living . Indeed , this is just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Coal , copper , and timber ; land suitable for the growing of cotton , wheat and citrous fruits ; grazing lands and fishing areas , to mention a few of the nation 's resources , are somewhat narrowly localized , but through exchange relations the people of each region use their natural resources to secure the products of other regions . The various regions thus enjoy the resources of the entire country . Similarly , the exchange of products among nations tends to 105 // amount to a mutual sharing of the natural resources of the world . Numbers and Resources . ? The number of persons that are to use the natural resources of a community , whether directly or through the exchange of products with the people of other commnities , will condition the returns per person that can be secured . In more detail , production per person depends upon three factors : ( 1 ) the number of persons , ' ( 2 ) the extent of the resources , , and ( 3 ) the methods employed in utilizing the resources. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier chapter , are of tremendous importance , but in order to emphasize the importance of the relation of numbers to resources we shall assume a given state of knowledge in regard to methods of work . Under such an assumption , it will appear that there are two distinct stages in the utilization of resources as the number of persons increases . The first of these stages is called increasing average returns and the second , diminishing average returns . These terms are usually used without the inclusion of the word average . They are then , however , less descriptive of the situations to which they refer than they are if the longer form is used . In addition to these two stages , a third stage will appear if the number of persons is increased sufficiently . This may be called the stage of decreasing total returns . Increasing Average Returns . ? As the number of persons that attempt to utilize a given area of resources increases beyond a very few the returns per person tend to increase , for as numbers increase there tends to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it possible for the total output in economic goods to be increased sufficiently in comparison with the increase in numbers to cause the average output to be thereby increased . Another way of stating this is ! that the degree of specialization may be so increased with the additional numbers that the above result will be experienced . 1 It is conceivable that in certain cases there might not be a stage of increasing returns , but it seems rather improbable that in the utilization of a given area of natural resources two or more persons could not secure a Iarger product per person // than could be secured by one individual if he were working alone . Diminishing Average Returns . ? Despite the fact of increasing average returns for a time , the possible output from any natural resource is limited . This is true , of course , of any object . Because of this simple fact , as the number of persons who are using a given area increases , it will inevitably happen that the returns which they can secure will eventually fail to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons . That is , it is inevitable that as numbers are augmented , the average output ? the per capita product ? will decrease . When this becomes true , the community is said to be in the stage of diminishing returns . Decreasing Total Returns . ? Finally , however , the total output will not be increased as more workers are added . Indeed , the total output may be reduced as a result of adding more workers . When such conditions prevail , the stage of decreasing total returns is said to have been reached . The following table , number 5 , illustrates the conditions which have been described in the two preceding paragraphs . As already indicated , this table is an illustration of the results that follow an increasing application of workers to a given natural resource as , for example , a tract of farming land , a region used for hunting and fishing , or the combined resources of a nation . Thus four persons will produce 38 units in , say , one year , while five persons would produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted that in the table there are assumed to be no differences whatever among the workers . That is , the 16th worker is just as able as is the 7th . The reason that he does not make any addition to the output is that the region is overcrowded , not that he is any less able than are the earlier workers . Further , in this table , no account is taken of the equipment that is used , in order that the major relationships may be more easily illustrated . The data are not compiled from experience , but they are clearly illustrative of the condition of economic life that is under investigation . The average output per worker is shown by the table to in108 SOME FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS Table crease with the addition of successive workers until 9 are engaged . Hence , up until and when 9 persons are working on this tract of land , the community is in the stage of increasing average returns . The addition of another one , the 10th , however , brings a reduction in the per capita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diminishing average returns , or diminishing returns , is reached after the 9th worker has been added . The employment of 9 workers upon this area thus gives the optimum return per worker ? the highest average output per person that can be secured . The table shows an increase in the total output as additional workers are added up until the addition of the 16th worker . This may be called the point of maximum returns . In the case of a nation , this point is not of much concern for it is almost impossible to conceive of a population so dense that another // worker would not be able to produce something in addition to the amount that could be produced without him . Still the point is of theoretical importance . Not to understand the possibilities of such a situation , regardless of its probability , is to be unappreciative of the fundamental relation between numbers and resources . Certainly for small tracts of land , the point of maximum returns is clearly possible . The last column is very interesting in connection with the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each succeeding worker added fewer units than did the preceding one . The stage of diminishing returns is sometimes defined to make it begin , in the terms of this table , after the 7th worker has been added . That is , it is defined as beginning when an additional worker will add less than was added by the last previous one . Writers are somewhat free , of course , to make their own definitions , but if the definition that has been generally accepted since the establishment of economics as a science is to be followed , then in terms of the table , diminishing returns do not begin until after the addition of the 9th man . By diminishing returns , then , in the case of the application of labor to a country 's resources , one does not mean that the total returns have begun to diminish , nor that an additional worker increases the product less than did the workers that were added previously . What is meant is that the average returns per worker , the per capita returns , would diminish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that the average returns have diminished as a result of an increase in numbers . Diminishing Returns in Business Establishments . ? The principle of diminishing returns is of universal application as was stated above . With any one factor given , the combination of more units of another factor will inevitably result in diminishing returns . This is due to the simple fact that the uses of returns that can be procured from one object are limited . In the firing of a coal furnace , for example , as more and more coal is added , the stages of increasing and diminishing returns , and finally maximum returns appear successively . The principle is also illustrated when a business man increases the scope of his // business . In such a case the man is the constant factor , and the plants or business items with which he deals represent the changing factor . As additions are thus made to the enterprise a point will be reached at which the returns per unit of the business will begin to diminish . In fact , as already indicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle that is under discussion . Just what balance should be maintained among the various factors in any business ? how much land should be used , how many buildings , how many machines , how many laborers ? is , obviously , a vital problem to every business man . The discussion of this subject must be postponed to a later place , l as attention must be restricted in this chapter to a consideration of the relation between the extent of the population and the natural resources . Diminishing Returns and Landowners vs . Non-landowners . ? The entrance of a community or a nation into the stage of diminishing returns affects the economic interests of landowners and non-landowners so differently that a discussion of this point may contribute to an understanding of the significance of diminishing returns . If the area indicated in the table is typical of the whole national area , then numbers should be so regulated that only 9 persons would seek employment upon this tract of land , if it is the national policy to maintain the highest possible standard of living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the population increase up to the point of maximum or total returns . Wages tend to equal the amount added by the last laborer engaged ? For example , in terms of the table an 11th worker would not be paid by a private landowning farmer more than 10 units , for that represents the addition which comes from his work . The farmer could pay him and the other laborers at the rate of 11.36 units , neglecting other expenses , and " come out even , " but this would mean that he would be giving away the possible profit which he might have . Assuming that all other regions are similarly populated , the 11th worker must be content with 10 units , as he can not get more from any other Footnote // owner . Then , since the other laborers are no better than he , as is assumed to be the case , they , too , can get but 10 units each . The total wage bill as indicated by the table will then amount to 110 units for this farmer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner as profit , or more properly , as land rent . If laborers are so numerous that 13 seek employment on this farm , that will mean that wages here and elsewhere in the country will be 7 units per worker . This will make a total wage bill for our farmer of 91 units and this subtracted from the total return of 141 units will give him a land rent of 50 units . Thus with laborers so few that only 11 seek employment on such an area , wages will be 10 units per person and the 11 laborers together will get 110/125 or 88 per cent of the total product ; but with population so dense that 13 workers will work upon this tract of land , wages will be 7 units per person and the 13 will get 91/141 or only 64 per cent of the total product . Thus as numbers increase , the non-landowning portion of the population is able to command less and less product in the form of wages per person and at the same time a constantly decreasing share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relatively . The land famine which is indicated by the emergence of diminishing returns thus smites the non-landowning portion of the population " with both edges of its sword . " 1 But if the population is so adjusted to resources that only 9 persons would seek employment upon this tract , wages would tend to represent the entire product , neglecting , as stated above , all other elements in the situation . Each laborer would tend to get 11.55 units and nothing would remain for the landlord . There would be no land rent , and , accordingly , there would not be any absentee owners , for workers would not become tenants and pay " rent . " They could not afford to do so , for then they would have less than the 11.55 units which is the rate of wages . Land would be for the most part free . No person would care to own it , save in order to enjoy improvements which he had made or expected to make upon it . Thus it is only when land gets into the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the owner . It is only then , or in anticipation of that event that it has any value , save as a means of protecting improvements . And as it is pushed farther and farther into the stage of diminishing returns it yields more and more rent to the owner without any effort on his part . In other words , as wages fall lower and lower in terms of product due to the overcrowding of the land , rent , and thus the market price of the land , rises higher and higher . Hence , it is apparent that owners of natural resources will profit from a policy that promotes such an increase in population , by immigration , for example , that the standard of living throughout the nation will be depressed . It is to the interest of the private landowners to have the nation far into the stage of diminishing returns , but that is clearly at the expense of the economic well-being of the nation 's population . The institutional character of the present economic system , which was discussed in Chapter V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between diminishing returns and wages . The discussion in the preceding paragraphs has been in terms of private ownership of land . As indicated above , if eleven persons should seek employment on a tract of land such as is indicated in the table , wages would tend to be 10 units per person . The average output per person would , however , be 11.36 units . Under the prevailing institution of private property it seems " natural " that wages should be 10 units in such a case and that the landlord should get net rent equal to 1.36 units per person working on the land . If , however , land were owned collectively , as under certain forms of socialism , it would seem " natural " that wages should be 11.36 units per person . In the latter supposed case each laborer would be held to have produced 11.36 units , but under the institution of private property , each laborer is commonly said to have produced 10 units . One method of reckoning wages is just as logical as the other . The difference comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Land Rent and Diminishing Returns . ? The above discussion suggests a method of ascertaining whether at any given time a // nation is in the stage of diminishing returns . If rent is being paid for land , if land commands a price , then the stage of diminishing returns must have been reached in that particular location on the best grade of land ; and the higher the rent , or the greater the price of the land , the farther must the community be in the stage of diminishing returns . But one section of a community may be in a condition of diminishing returns while the entire community may be in the stage of increasing returns . The concentration of population , as in a city , may through the high rentals that are paid for ground space indicate that the stage of diminishing returns has been reached in that place , but land that is some distance removed from the city may still be in the stage of increasing returns . The eastern section of the United States was in the stage of diminishing returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . This is to be explained by the reluctance of persons to move into new territory , or to take up new kinds of work . Rather than move to new land and enjoy a larger product , many persons prefer to remain with old friends and at accustomed lines of employment . When rent is being paid for all of the land of a nation there canbe no question that the country is in the stage of diminishing returns . Improvement in Methods . ? In the preceding analysis a given method of work has been assumed to prevail . But as methods of work change , the situation relative to numbers and resources necessarily alters . An improvement in method is equal to an increase in the extent of resources . In other words , improvements may counteract the decline in the output per person that tends to come with an increase in the population ; and indeed they may easily make it possible for a very large number of persons to have a larger per capita output than was possible when fewer persons utilized the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some kind might make it possible to double or treble the output per person with any given number of workers . It is because of the tremendous improvement in economic processes , both mechanical and non-mechanical , that 118,000,000 // people are able to enjoy a higher standard of living in the United States to-day than prevailed over the same area in 1870 with a population of only 38,000,000 . This may , of course , be due in part to an increase in specialization or cooperation that has been made possible by the growth in numbers . That is , the nation may have been in the stage of increasing returns ( luring part , at least , of this period . But undoubtedly , the marked improvements that have been made since 1870 in mechanics , industrial chemistry , and agriculture have been of tremendous importance in making possible the present standard of living . Among the many significant improvements during this period may be mentioned the invention of the gas engine , perfection of the electric dynamo , great advances in the manufacture of steel , increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moving machinery of all kinds , and very substantial improvements in the yield of crops and in the productiveness of live stock . The effect of method upon economic welfare can be even more strikingly shown by comparing the well-being of the people in the United States to-day with the standard of living that prevailed among the North American Indians . The Indians had at their command the same natural resources that are now being used by the people of the United States , but were able to maintain on a very meager standard of living only some 150,000 to 300,000 persons as a maximum . An increase in population with them would have taxed severely the natural resources as they were utilizing them . After a region is well populated , a very important question , so far as economic welfare is concerned , is , what will be the effect of an increase in numbers upon improvement in industrial methods . An increase in population might lead to improvements through the presence of persons of genius who would not have been born if numbers had not been augmented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so acute from increased numbers that men would devise new methods as a result of this pressure . On the other hand , large numbers might so reduce welfare that less effort could be devoted to education , // with the result that the general state of knowledge would be reduced , and industrial improvements thus made less likely than if numbers had not been increased . Further , an increase in numbers might eventually lead to a state of misery and hopelessness on the part of the general population that would bring a marked deterioration in the methods of work . The effect of an increase in numbers upon improvements in methods is thus problematical . If an addition to the population should cause improvements to be made in the industrial methods , then , economic welfare might be increased as numbers are augmented , depending of course , upon the relation between the degree of improvement and the number of people that are added. , One " improvement " that may counteract the pressure of population upon resources may be merely a change in diet from foods requiring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in smaller space . Meats as compared with cereals are very expensive in terms of land area . It has been computed that corn yields 3 ? 124,200 Calories per acre , and potatoes , rye , wheat and rice over 1,500,000 Calories per acre ; while pork and beef afford respectively only 672,945 and 130,000 Calories for each acre of land utilized in their production . ' It is , of course , by no means true that these figures indicate the relative number of persons that could be supported on a vegetable diet as compared with a meat diet , but they do indicate that a change in the diet of the American people away from meats would make it possible to provide food for many more persons than compose the present population ? What ability the men of the future may have in using the resources of the earth is beyond our ken . Some improvements may be definitely expected to take place , but it does not seem probable that the tremendous advances in technique during the past one hundred years will be duplicated during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements will be made is not sufficient to warrant an attitude Footnote // of indifference as to the relation between numbers and resources . History and contemporary conditions in certain countries show very clearly that numbers may so outrun improvements in methods that well-being may be reduced far below what it might be if the population were held in check . The Growth of Population . ? Any plant or animal has the latent capacity to increase to tremendous numbers if food is available and enemies absent . Human beings are no exception to this rule . There has probably been no time since the beginning of civilization , however , when this maximum biological possibility of increase has been utilized by the human race . While the birth rate is very high in some countries to-day , it is probably nowhere so great as it might be , nor is the death rate in any country to-day so low as it would be if present medical knowledge were utilized to the fullest extent . Within recent years Canada has perhaps had the highest rate of natural increase ( birth rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This has been estimated to have been 29.8 per 1000 between 1906 and 1911.1 This rate of increase means a doubling of the population every twenty-four years . The significance of this rate of increase may be indicated by the fact that if the earth had been depopulated at the beginning of the Christian era , except for one couple , the doubling of the population every twenty-five years would have brought the population of the world to the astounding figure of 302,231,454 , - 903,656,909,676,544 by 1925 . The absolute impossibility of such a rate of increase being maintained for nineteen centuries is evident from the fact that such a number would mean 189,000 , - 000 persons for every square foot of land area of the world , including mountain peaks and swamps . Clearly , the ; limitation of natural resources imposes a positive check upon the growth of the population . One of the most significant statements of the population question was made by Malthus , an English writer , in an essay published in 1798 . His position was , briefly , that population Footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population will always , be in a state of misery . In subsequent editions of the essay , he modified the rigor of his statement somewhat , allowing some scope for the prudential check as a means of keeping down numbers . By the prudential check he meant the postponement of marriage and family responsibility until means were available to give a proper standard of living . But despite this modification , his position remained essentially a very pessimistic one . This is the Malthusian law of population . The standard of living that prevails to-day shows that the conditions predicted by Malthus do not exist . It is argued by some , however , that the development of the western hemisphere and the tremendous increase in efficiency made possible by the mechanical improvements of the past one hundred and fifty years , rather than checks upon the growth of population , are responsible for the relatively high standard of living to which we are accustomed ; and it is argued further , that with no new lands to be occupied and with perhaps no great additions to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until overcrowding will result in the state of misery that Malthus thought to be the lot of man , The two big factors in the situation are , obviously , the rate of natural increase , and the state of the industrial arts . No one knows , as suggested above , whether much or little improvement in work processes is to be made in the future . There would seem to be no question that some mechanical progress may be confidently expected , but whether this will be of major proportions as was true of our industrial improvements during the past century can not be foretold . If the future advances in technique are assumed to be of minor rather than of major magnitudes , then the important question is the rate of natural increase in the population. * Even a low rate of increase will , of course , mean overcrowding eventually . The present rate of natural increase in the United States is about 11 per 1,000 per year . At this rate numbers would double in sixty-two years . But the birth rate has de118 SOME FUNDAMENTAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national existence , ' and if it should continue to decline the population will finally become stationary . It is perhaps reasonable to believe that our population will become stationary in another hundred years or so . Indeed , this condition may be less than one hundred years away . ' Families of all classes are more and more exercising choice in regard to the number of children . The increasing degree of city life is undoubtedly a factor in fostering the conscious limitation of numbers . In addition to its effect upon conscious control , the highly developed complexity of our modern life may reduce fecundity . But regardless of the cause , the fact of decline in the birth rate in every country affected by the modern industrial movement is unquestioned . This decline has manifested itself in Catholic as well as Protestant countries , among colored populations , as well as white . ' Whatever may actually be in store for the human race in the future , there can certainly be no question that a high standard of living is possible only by a sharp limitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked improvements in the industrial arts . The increase in the population of Europe and England during the past hundred years has undoubtedly prevented a realization of the gains that would otherwise have come from the great increase in industrial efficiency during that time . And perhaps , also , the population increase in the United States has kept economic well-being below the point it would have reached if the population had not increased so rapidly . It is certainly only because one desires large totals in national production rather than a high degree of individual welfare that there is reasonableness in the oft-repeated statement that the decline in the rate of increase of the population is undesirable Footnote // economically . However , if a large military population is a major desideratum in national policy , an augmentation of numbers should be encouraged . Also , a desire on the part of the more well-to-do classes for greater ease and comfort would justify them in encouraging an increase in numbers on the part of the masses to the end that wages of laborers may be low and servants plentiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES 73.

Footnote CHAPTER VIII INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT Men do not work with their bare hands . Indeed , just as soon as men became men they devised means that would assist them in their attempt to utilize the provisions of nature . Although these devices were very crude in their early stages , yet they were of tremendous importance . As already suggested , a knowlledge of how to construct and use industrial equipment is of far greater importance than the mechanical devices themselves , for the instruments if lost could be replaced , while if the knowledge of their construction should be lost they could neither be repaired when broken nor replaced when worn out , and the loss of knowledge of their utilization would make the devices of no importance . Ordinarily , the existence of an instrument implies the ability to use it and to construct another to take its place when it is worn out . Hence , to emphasize the importance of industrial equipment is to assume an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have now , as has been emphasized in the earlier chapters , are of major importance in our economic life . Not only have men thus devised tools and machines to assist them in the utilization of the forces of nature , but early in the life of the race , animals were domesticated and made effective instruments of economic welfare . Such animals comprise an important part of our industrial equipment to-day . Obviously , any improvement that is made in them , as , for example , in increasing the power of draft horses , or the yield of milk from cows , or wool from sheep , is similar in its economic effect to improvements in machinery . Indirect Goods . ? The distinctive characteristic of the goods which may properly be classified as industrial equipment is that 121 // they make their contribution to the satisfaction of human wants indirectly rather than directly . A house , for example , satisfies wants directly by furnishing shelter , and usually , also , other utilities ( services ) , while a hammer or a saw satisfies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Goods which thus give service indirectly through the production of other goods are called production goods , while those that yield their services directly are known as consumption goods . The natural resources also for the most part yield their services indirectly , and are therefore to be classed as production goods . But there is a marked difference between these two groups of production goods : one is itself produced and the other exists independently of man 's effort . The ever-present difficulty of classification ; namely , the existence of border-line cases , is a little disturbing here . Some land , for example , by being cleared of trees or stone may be said to be produced . But regardless of this difficulty , the classification is important , especially because of the difference that results in the pricing of the goods that are produced , as compared with natural resources . The discussion of the effect on the price of land of pushing cultivation into the stage of diminishing returns has already indicated the characteristic of natural resources that is distinctive in this respect ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural resources tend to increase without any effort on the part of owners . In other words , the amount that goes to owners of natural resources in the form of land rent , whether measured in goods or money , tends to increase as the population increases . This is not true of things that are produced . They tend to sell at prices that will return to their owners enough to cover the expense of producing them plus a reasonable profit . They thus do not normally yield a surplus over and above expenses as is true of natural resources after the stage of diminishing returns has been reached . The subject of the price relation of these two groups of goods will be much more fully discussed in the chapters on price . Production goods may thus be divided into two classes , one that exists in nature without the work of man , and the other // that comes as a result of his efforts being applied to the materials and forces of nature . The second of these groups ? the goods that are produced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly defined as capital goods , or simply , capital . The word capital , however , is used in so many other senses that it will perhaps usually be well to designate this class of goods by the longer term industrial equipment . In addition to the yield of indirect services , production goods also give some direct services . That is , the owners of some production goods get the same satisfaction from them that is derived from beautiful rugs , furniture , or pretty clothes . Further , some goods are used at times as production goods and at other times as consumption goods . These considerations , however , do not invalidate the classification of goods into the two divisions of consumption and production goods . An increase in the volume of equipment goods tends to increase economic welfare by making it possible to utilize more fully the forces and materials of nature . But clearly , a point could be reached where an increase in the volume of such goods would be wasteful rather than advantageous . If enough axes , for example , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be advisable to cease the production of axes and turn to the production of other things . However , if improvements in tools and machinery are being constantly made , the limit of advisable additions to equipment can hardly be reached . To promote such improvement , education , of course , is advisable . Further , since the primary purpose of having production goods is to produce consumption goods , any increase in the durability of the latter reduces the importance of the former . To increase the durability of houses , furniture , automobiles , roadways , and clothing is to augment welfare by making it possible to supply a population with those goods with less labor and less equipment than was previously necessary . Roundabout Production . ? The process of using intermediate goods in the production of consumption goods was characterized as " roundabout production " by a celebrated Austrian economist , Bohm-Bawerk . This term throws a clarifying light // on the whole process of the manufacture and use of industrial equipment . It suggests the important truth that to produce equipment and then use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than in a direct manner . Thus to get wood for a fire in a direct manner would mean the gathering of sticks by hand from dead trees and branches ; but to get it in a roundabout way one might successively secure iron ore , refine it , fashion it into a cutting edge , attach it to a handle , and then use the tool thus derived to cut down trees and chop them into firewood . All industrial equipment is thus part of a roundabout process . The term roundabout normally carries the connotation of undesirability , and is thus a somewhat unfortunate term in this connection . But no term that more aptly designates the industrial process of producing one thing in order that it may be used to produce another has been suggested . Roundaboutness is not , however , invariably advisable in the production of goods and services . Whether it is desirable depends upon the circumstances of the particular case . In many cases it makes possible the doing of things that would otherwise be impossible , such , for example , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it increases to tremendous proportions the possibilities of accomplishment , as in the sending of messages by radio as compared with foot messengers . But in some situations the direct method is superior . In teaching , for example , the giving of services by the teacher directly to the student is usually preferable to having the services given indirectly through a phonograph or other mechanical device . Where the same kind of result can be secured in either way , as in catching fish with the hand or with a line or net , the choice will depend upon the economy of labor power in one method as compared with the other . If more fish can be secured with a given number of days ' labor in one way than in the other , then , obviously , the one way is the more advisable , if the two methods are equally advisable in all other respects . Wages and Machinery . ? It is often said that high wages make the use of machinery advisable , while low wages make it economical to use labor without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand , and that of the United States on the other , are given in confirmation of this point , for in the one country very low wages prevail and machinery is not used , while in the other , wages are high and machinery is extensively used . The above discussion , however , tends toward the disproof of this contention . Since the use of machinery is merely the application of labor in a roundabout manner , the factor of wages would seem to be of no effect . The important question would appear to be whether labor ? labor time ? is saved in one method as compared with the other . Hence , the general question as to the desirability of using laborers to make machines and then use them , as compared with using labor to accomplish the task more directly , can be entirely resolved without a consideration of the rate of wages . The business man , however , who is considering whether he shall substitute machinery for some of the laborers he would otherwise employ , must consider the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The relationship which has just been noted suggests that if wages are high , the price of machinery will also be high because of the expense of producing it , while low wages would mean that machines will be low in price . Thus in general , the rate of wages sets the prices that must be charged for machinery , and consequently , high wages do not make it profitable to buy and use machinery that could not be bought and used profitably if wages were lower . But while high wages do not make the use of a roundabout method profitable if it would not be profitable if low wages prevailed , yet if either method is more profitable than the other , any increase in the rate of wages will increase its profitableness measured in terms of money . It is more worth while to a business man to save 10 days of labor if labor costs 10 dollars a day than if it costs 50 cents a day . Thus if the machine process is the more economical because of the saving of labor time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business man , if the machine is used . As a result , an increase in wages may lead to the introduction of machinery not because its use is // made profitable by the rise in wages , but because the wage increase augments the gain that could already have been secured . The tendency that has been described may not always be realized . Particularly , the wages that certain employers have to pay may go up , while the wages paid to laborers that make machines may not rise . Thus the price of equipment would not rise , and hence it would be advisable to substitute machines for laborers in the plants under consideration . This is more likely to be true if machinery is imported into a given country than if it is produced in the country in which it is used , for in the case of two different countries the movements of wages may not be parallel . But as wages tend to move somewhat uniformly throughout an economic society , an increase in the rate of wages in plants that might use machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of machinery , which would remove the advantages of substituting it for the laborers whose wages have risen . This would tend to be true since the rise of wages in the one group would tend to have its counterpart in a wage increase in the group that is employed in manufacturing machinery , and thus the cost of making machinery , and hence its selling price , would increase . This all depends , to repeat , upon the simple fact that machinery is really not substituted for labor ; labor is used in a roundabout manner , first to produce machinery and then to use it . The rate of interest rather than the rate of wages is of importance in determining the profitableness of using machinery as compared with the use of direct labor . The use of equipment normally calls for a larger supply of money in the conduct of an enterprise than does the use of labor service without machinery . Hence , as the rate of interest rises , the use of machinery becomes less economical than otherwise , and as the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher interest rates . Further ' , of course , any improvement in the method of constructing machinery , or in its effectiveness , encourages its utilization because of the increased labor economy thereby made possible . But , undoubtedly , the most significant factors influencing the // extent to which machinery is used are found in the general characteristics of an economic society , rather than in rates of wages and interest . Knowledge , ingenuity , progressiveness , available markets , and a high degree of well-being that makes possible the devotion of labor to roundabout and time-consum-ing processes are of prime importance . The last-named factor may be phrased as the possession of an adequate supply of loanable funds , for loanable funds exist because individuals are not forced to use their money in buying the necessities of life . In these several respects there is marked contrast between the United States and India ; and on the basis of these differences , the extensive use of machinery in the one country and the use of tools in the other can be explained . ' Goods as Savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any one time may properly be described as the savings of the society , or as social savings . This term is often used in economic literature as if it applied only to the produced goods that are to be used in further production ; but , certainly , consumption goods are also savings . Anything that has been produced and is not yet used up has necessarily been saved . Most consumption goods , however , are short-lived ; food is conspicuously so , but houses and furniture are noteworthy exceptions to the rule . On the other hand , most forms of indus-trial equipment are relatively durable . Thus there is warrant for thinking of the savings of a society as being very largely represented by the productive equipment which exists at any one time . But , it must be remembered , these goods do not com-prise the total savings , consumption goods must also be included . Social and Individual Savings . ? Saving on the part of the individual may take the form of the accumulation of money ; the storing up of goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction or purchase ( that is , in effect , getting others to undertake the construction ) of production goods or durable con-Footnote // sumption goods . If the saving on the part of the individual increases the supply of goods , it will necessarily amount to social saving . If , on the other hand , individual saving takes the form of the accumulation of money , there are three possible situations . In the first place , if the individual merely hoards his money there is no resulting social saving . Secondly , if he should make a loan to a spendthrift ? to one who spends it , for example , in giving a banquet ? social saving would not result ; although if the individual who loaned the money took ample security for the loan , the volume of his own savings would not be reduced . Thirdly , the loan of the money might be made to one who will hire laborers to erect a factory , build a machine , or construct a house , and thus social saving as well as individual saving would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial leaders , and , as well , practically all persons who give advice in regard to economic conduct , emphasize the importance of saving . They extoll investing and decry spending . The implication is that there is no possible limit either to the desirable volume of industrial equipment or to the desirable degree of frugality on the part of individuals . Careful analysis shows this to be unsound . There can be no need for industrial plants if persons are not to use the products . It would be foolish indeed to build machines , to build machines ad infinitum , with no thought of ever using the product . Indeed , it is only because consumption goods are desired ? because people do spend ? that there is social justification , and monetary profit to individuals , in producing industrial equipment . If all persons in the United States were to adopt the scale of living that prevailed one hundred years ago , there would be employment for but very little of the existing industrial equipment . Likewise , but little labor power would then be needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alternative to a high standard of consumption is not the building of more equipment , as is implied in the emphasis upon saving , but an increased amount of leisure . In other words , a working day of abnormally short duration , if output per hour could be // maintained at present standards , would amply supply the bare necessities of life . The problem of saving versus spending assumes different proportions when looked at from the point of view of a single individual rather than of society as a whole . Extreme frugality on the part of all would make extensive saving unnecessary and impossible . But the frugality of particular individuals in a society of " spenders " gives opportunity to make individual savings , which to some degree , perhaps wholly , may amount to social savings . Those who save , build plants to supply those who wish to spend . Henry Ford , for example , has become one of the world 's richest men because of two conditions : many people have wished to buy automobiles rather than save the price of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with machines . The first of these two conditions is as important as the second . Ford 's extensive plants have come because he could sell automobiles as well as because he was able and willing to save in order to build them . As with an individual so with a nation . If the people of one nation are frugal and efficient , they may become very rich by supplying the less frugal people of other nations with the goods which they desire to consume . This would tend to give the business men in the one nation control over the resources and equipment that are located in the other nations , for the people in the spendthrift nations would tend to sell or mortgage their equipment and natural resources to the frugal persons from whom they purchased the consumption goods . It is on the basis of the advantage which saving thus gives to particular individuals and nations that the emphasis upon the importance of saving mainly rests . Further , there is but little danger that a sufficient portion of the incomes of most individuals will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a likelihood that not enough will be saved . That is , the disposition of most persons is such that emphasis must be placed upon the importance of saving in order to promote rational conduct . The need of making provision for the " rainy day " can hardly be overemphasized . // Concentration of Wealth and Industrial Equipment . ? The point is often made that great fortunes on the part of the few are necessary to the production of industrial equipment . It will be recalled that there are two conditions requisite to the construction of industrial plants in an individualistic society such as ours . Namely , some persons must have the ability and the desire to spend money for the products of such plants , and other persons , or the same persons , must have the ability and the willingness to save money for the construction of the plants . In the case of great fortunes , the second of these conditions is admirably fulfilled , for if the fortune is extremely large , to save all , or almost all of the income from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But even such a situation will not lead to the building of plants unless there is sufficient buying power on the part of the many to purchase the product . On the other hand , if there are no large fortunes , if , indeed , there is approximate equality of wealth throughout the society , and if this wealth is sufficient in quantity to provide a large volume of buying power , it may confidently be expected that a volume of saving sufficient to provide adequate means for the production of the consumption goods for which there is demand will be forthcoming . That the collection of the savings of many into funds with which to carry on large scale enterprises is by no means impossible is evidenced constantly in the volume of savings collected by banks and other savings institutions , and the extensive sales of stocks and bonds to the general public . The Savings of Corporations . ? One very important source of industrial equipment to-day is the savings of corporations . For the most part , corporations pay only a nominal rate of return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income that is secured . The difference between these two items represents savings by the corporation . This saving largely takes the form of additions to equipment ; but to some extent it is represented by stocks of raw material , finished goods , and , in some cases , cash in banks . This process is often described by saying that the corporation " puts the money earned back into the business . " It is perhaps // better to say that the money earned is retained in the business . What really happens is that as money is received in excess of the amount needed to carry on the business of the corporation and pay a nominal rate of dividends , say 5 to 7 per cent , the extra amount is used to enlarge the business . The Ford Motor Company is a conspicuous illustration of the retention of earnings for the purpose of enlarging an enterprise . This mammoth business , save for a very small original investment , has been built entirely out of profits that have been saved by the corporation and used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to collect the savings of persons who are not " in business , " and make them available to business men for the conduct of their enterprises are of great importance . Savings banks , commercial banks , postal savings banks , building and loan associations , and insurance companies are conspicuous among such savings institutions . The funds collected in this manner normally find their way into business enterprises through the managers of the savings institutions purchasing stocks and bonds issued by business concerns . The savings institution thus stands between the individual and the enterprise which uses his savings . And , incidentally , the institution thus assumes the risk that is involved in the investment . Investment banks perform a similar function , but their manner of operation differs in that they first make the investment and then sell the securities which they receive to their customers , rather than first borrow from their customers and then invest the amount borrowed , as savings institutions do . The general effect is the same in either case . Many commercial banks do , in part , the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also play the part of financial middlemen in making the savings of individuals available for the use of business men . Oversaving . ? Rather than emphasize the need for saving money , certain writers insist that our economic society is forever being cursed by having an excess of savings , relative to the amount that is available for the purchase of consumption // goods . The point made is that so much is saved that the remaining buying power is not sufficient to take from the market the consumption goods that are produced , and further that the savings are used to produce additional equipment which further auguients the volume of consumption goods to be sold in relation to the volume of purchasing power than can be devoted to buying such goods . As a result , so the argument runs , business men are unable to sell at a profit the goods that they have produced , and after this has gone on for about a decade , business firms are so overstocked with goods that can not be sold at a profit that prices are cut and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle factories , unemployment , and great distress to the poorer classes . The period during which these conditions prevail is known as a business depression . This theory will be discussed in the chapter dealing with business cycles . It is sufficient at the present time to call attention to the fact that some students think that too much is saved in our society . Whether the business depressions that appear so frequently are due to oversaving , it is significant to note that we do have an excess of industrial equipment relative to the use that we make of it . Our automobile factories are able to turn out almost twice as many cars as can be sold ; the shoe factories produce 977,000 pairs of shoes per day , although they have a capacity of 1,750,000 pairs ; and the annual consumption of sugar is about 4,000,000 tons , while our sugar refineries are equipped to produce 8,000,000 tons . The normal output of clothing could be produced with from 31 to 86 per cent less plant capacity than is available . The Portland cement industry since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet all of the demands for cement . Normal requirements in 1921 called for 32,000,000 tons of steel , but the plants were able to produce 54,120,000 tons . Blast furnaces have so exceeded the need for them that the upkeep cost on idle furnaces has been estimated as averaging $79,000,000 per year for the past decade . ' Footnote // This phenomenon of excess plant capacity in perhaps all , or at least in almost all , lines of industry is very interesting . It seems to indicate that , looked at as a whole , our society is not in need of increased savings . The further fact that we are now exporting large sums of " capital " each year also indicates a volume of production beyond the domestic demand for the goods that are produced . " Capital " export does not , it must be noted , mean the sending of money abroad , nor necessarily the sending of industrial equipment . It means that goods of one kind or another are being sold abroad in excess of the goods that are being purchased from abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bonds , notes , and other evidences of debt . Stated differently , this means that the people of this nation are producing goods not for their own use but for the use of the people of other nations . The foreign peoples who receive these goods may later produce other goods which will be shipped into this country in payment for these that we are now selling to them on credit . However , such payment , if attempted , will be vigorously opposed by many , perhaps by most , persons in this country on the ground that since our factories can not sell at a profit in the domestic market all of the goods that they could produce , to permit foreign traders to ship in goods would " hurt business . " There are many aspects to this question which can not be discussed in this chapter , but , clearly , large shipments abroad on credit indicate an abundance rather than a shortage of equipment in relation to domestic needs . An important factor in explaining the existence of a surplus of equipment will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy Used to Produce Industrial Equipment . ? The popular impression prevails that a large part of the economic activity of a modern society is devoted to the producing of industrial equipment . An examination of the number of persons engaged in different occupations shows , on the contrary , that but a relatively small part of our economic activity is devoted to this end . Such a study made // by the present writer a few years ago 1 showed that neglecting the persons engaged in producing the required raw materials , but slightly more than 14 per cent of the persons gainfully employed in the United States in 1914 were engaged in the production of factory machinery , and less than 4 of I per cent in the construction and repair of factory buildings . Of the number in gainful occupations in that year , over 12,500,000 , or one-third of the total , were in agriculture , forestry , and animal husbandry , yet only 51,425 persons were given by the census as engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements . The wage earners already referred to who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , factory machinery , and agricultural implements ) and all of those who were engaged in the manufacture and repair of railway rolling stock , and the construction and repair of railway roadbed , not including the manufacture of steel rails , were estimated to comprise less than 44 per cent of our working population for the year 1914 . The statistics of our exports and imports of industrial equipment make it seem all the more startling that such a very small portion of our labor energy was devoted to providing us with equipment . For these figures show that for each of the three fiscal years ending June 30 , 1913 , 1914 , and 1915 , the value of our exports of machinery and agricultural implements was over twenty times the value of our imports of such articles . The conclusion appears to be very safe that most of the energy of men is devoted to providing a living day by day , and but little to providing equipment for more effective work in the future . It is because of this fact that a nation recovers so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political conditions within it and neighboring nations permit individuals to resume their normal tasks .

The function of the capitalist is so important in our economic society that it is desirable to give it further consideration at this place . The somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this chapter . 1 . THE CAPITALIST The Function of the Capitalist . ? To carry on production in a roundabout way necessarily involves spreading the productive process over a period of time . And even aside from any degree of " roundaboutness , " the production of economic goods takes time . Indeed , any act of man requires time for its performance , but in the production of food , the making of clothing , the building of houses , or the manufacture of pencils , books , or automobiles a great amount of time elapses from the moment when the first effort is made to produce the raw material until the article is in the hands of the final consumer . If the production of the tools and machines that are used is included in the calculation , as should properly be done , the time involved in the production of these goods is seen to be very great indeed . From the point of view of the length of time consumed in the various economic operations , our present society differs greatly from that of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been completed , the time required for the manufacture of a product is very short as compared with the time required when manufacturing was a hand process , but including the production of the factories and their equipment the work processes are far longer than formerly . 137 // In order that any appreciable length of time may elapse between the performance of economic activity and the use of the finished product , it is necessary that there should be a surplus in the form of food , or what amounts to the same thing , a surplus in the form of leisure . These two are identical because to have leisure means that one possesses sufficient food to maintain life , or that food may be easily procured . Without such a supply of food , there could be no leisure because all of one 's time would necessarily be spent in the procurement of the means of subsistence . With such a food situation , one can turn aside from the task of securing sustenance and devote part of his energy to planting and tending a crop or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed until a distant date . The original capitalists ' were those persons who thus either ( 1 ) saved up a supply of food and then lived upon this while they cultivated a crop or made a tool or performed some other task that did not at once yield a return in the form of food but that would later give them an increased supply of food or other commodities ; or ( 2 ) used the leisure which they had because of an abundant food supply to produce equipment . Every increase in labor efficiency , which has resulted from new methods , has permitted the application of labor to still more time-consuming or roundabout projects , and thus economic gains have tended to be cumulative . But , as in the beginning of industrial progress , it has been only because of the willingness of some persons to play the role of capitalist that the still further improvements were realized which the initial improvements made possible . As the illustrations already used make clear , the use of money is not necessary to the performance of the capitalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering of service by the capitalists . For convenience in discussion , this function will be further considered in terms of money . Various persons in the economic society come into the possession of money ; some of these spend their money in the purchase of consumption goods while other persons save theirs and with it hire laborers , or loan it to others who hire laborers , to // engage in time-consuming processes , some of which may not yield consumption goods until after a very long period of time has elapsed . The capitalist thus transfers his money claims , with which he might purchase consumption goods , to laborers ; and they by expending it with merchants procure the necessaries of life which will permit them to engage in work that does not at once issue into consumption goods . The laborers thus receive compensation at the time the work is performed , but the capitalist must wait for his reward until the services of the laborer become a usable or a salable product . In effect , the capitalist advances goods to laborers in anticipation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his function to save and to use his savings in the conduct of economic enterprises . He provides the carrying power that is necessary for the completion of time-consuming projects . But the capitalistic function is also performed in loaning to a spendthrift . That is , the assistance of the capitalist is necessary to the conduct of the time-consuming ( roundabout ) processes that are such a marked feature of our economic system , but his function is not restricted to such service . The essence of the capitalistic function is to use goods or money for future gain . The capitalist as a capitalist always has an eye to the future ; he builds railroads , constructs factories , prepares land , plants trees , loans money , all with a view to augmenting his wealth . It is only because of this disposition on the part of some persons that the extensive industrial equipment which we have to-day has come into existence . All persons are not inclined to be capitalists . Some think only in terms of the present . They adjust their lives to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow we die . " While it is necessary that persons be able and willing to spend money for consumption goods in order to justify others in building industrial equipment , as was developed in the preceding chapter , the point here is that saving ? carrying power ? is indispensable as a basis for the economic progress that comes through improved mechanical processes . The capitalists have not been responsible for all of the improvements that have been made in economic processes . Some // new hid ho Is were the result of chance discoveries rather than of patient . work on the basis of savings . Further , economic efficiency is not . necessarily increased as capital accumulations make it possible to lengthen the time of an economic project , but on the whole an increase in the degree of roundaboutness throughout industry has made it possible to utilize more effectively the forces and materials of nature . In other words , it has tended to increase the economic efficiency of human beings . Such improvements have obviously made possible a higher standard of living ; they have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the necessities of life . And in providing these improvements , to repeat , the services of capitalists have been necessary . In everyday speech , a capitalist is one who uses a great deal of money in this way , but strictly speaking , anyone is a capitalist who has money , however small the quantity may be , and loans or invests it with the idea of thereby securing an income . The Payment of the Capitalist . ? Strange as it may seem , many persons have objected to paying the capitalist for the service which he renders . He has , however , all through the ages received payment . This has been in the form of what is called interest . The economic return which is properly called profit is received in connection with the performance of another function ( that of the entrepreneur ) which will be described presently . The reason that interest has always been paid is that there has at all times been a demand for the savings that people have been willing to make . This demand has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy consumption goods , but the principal source of the demand for loan funds , particularly since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , has been the business men . Their desire to borrow has been due to the fact that it has been profitable to use money in business . The total economic product , as suggested in the preceding chapter , is produced by labor , using the term broadly to include mental as well as manual labor services . The interest which the capitalist receives comes from the total product , and thus beTHE // cause of this deduction , not to mention others , labor gets less than " the full value of its product . " It is on the basis of this statement of the case that some persons object to the payment of interest . It must be remembered , however , that the capitalist pays the laborer in advance of the sale or use of the product that comes from the labor services . If a laborer , for example , planted a fruit tree , he would be entitled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , barring any question as to the original ownership of the tree or of the land upon which it is grown . But clearly the tree at the time of planting is not worth as much as the fruit will be worth as it ripens in the successive seasons . If the tree will bear five bushels per year for a period of ten years , beginning with the second year after it is planted , and if we may assume that no labor need be expended in caring for it , the full product of the labor expended in planting the tree will be fifty bushels of fruit ; but , obviously , if the laborer sells the tree at the time of planting , he will not get the equivalent of fifty bushels . The person buying the tree will not pay this much for it , because he will have to wait two years for the first fruit and twelve years for the last fruit that he is to get . He will at the time of planting buy only at a discount the fruit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be noted , assumes that there is no uncertainty as to the amount of fruit that will be borne by the tree in the different seasons . This element in the situation will be discussed presently . If the laborer is paid wages for setting out the tree , this is equivalent to his selling the tree just after he has planted it . He gets an immediate income , but the man who pays him wages must wait until later for the income that he is to receive . This illustration is very characteristic of business processes . Those who do not wish to wait or who can not afford to wait , sell their products and labor service for less than their future value ; and conversely the business men who buy goods and services , pay less than their final value because it can not be realized until some future time . The difference between such present and future value is interest , neglecting the element of uncertainty , or risk . // The Rate of Interest . ? The percentage relation between the capital suns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . The fluctuations in the rate of interest , together with the variation iii the prices of consumption goods , is within broad limits an important element in determining the volume of capitalists ' services ( savings ) that will be forthcoming ; or , in other words , in determining the relation between spending and saving ; between the volume of consumption goods and the volume of production goods . Or to put the matter still differently , it is thus in part , at least , that a balance is held between the amount of labor service used in extending or maintaining time-consuming projects as compared with the amount that is spent in using equipment and in satisfying human wants directly . Assume that almost all of the people of a community should rather suddenly desire to " live better " ? to use more and better consumption goods , such as clothing , house room , house furnishings , automobiles , and theatrical productions ? rather than to continue to save as much as they have been saving . The prices of consumption goods would rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would wish to enlarge their plants to supply this increase in demand . To do so it would be necessary for them to have money with which to employ persons to do this work . Further , it would be essential that existing plants should be repaired and machinery replaced from time to time . This also would require the use of money . But the increase in spending would mean that less money was being saved and consequently that business men would find it difficult , if not impossible , to get the money that they required to repair and expand their industrial plants . Accordingly , they would increase their bids for the loan of money , that is , the rate of interest would rise . Consumers would then find that the prices that they were paying in spending their money were increasing , and that the rate of interest which they could get if they would save their money was also increasing . As a result , some persons would be encouraged to reduce their expenditures and increase their savings , and a new balance would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , if there should be an increase in the desire to save , a decrease in the desire to " live well , " in the present , anyway , more money would be available for the use of business men in extending their operations , and then more labor would be devoted to the production of industrial equipment . This would lead eventually to a still larger output of consumption goods . But since there is , by assumption , a decrease in the demand for such goods their prices would fall . This would mean that the profits of business men would decline and they would then reduce their bids for the use of money funds . The fall in the price of consumption goods and the reduction in the rate of interest would encourage persons to increase their expenditures and to reduce their savings . Thus a new balance would be established between spending and saving , that is , between the volume of labor service that is applied in maintaining or extending industrial equipment on the one hand , and in using the present equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , not all of the money borrowed at interest is used in the construction or maintenance of industrial equipment . Some is used in employing labor to use equipment and some in the purchase of consumption goods . Further , the effect of the rate of interest upon the savings of all individuals is far from uniform . Then , too , the policy of the banks is very significant in determining the volume of money that , is available for the use of business men . Finally , as suggested at the beginning of this discussion , it is only within rather broad limits that variations in the rate of interest and in the prices of consumption goods alter the spending-saving habits of the people of a community . Restrictive forces tend to prevent adjustments from being made as freely and nicely as has been assumed . But , broadly speaking , the fluctuations in the rate of interest and the variations in the prices of consumption goods alter the amount spent and the amount saved and thus tend to establish a balance between the volume of equipment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist ( the rate of interest ) will be more fully discussed in a later chapter as one // of the shares into which the economic income of a society is divided . The discussion in this chapter has been from the point of view of the production of industrial equipment . II . THE ENTREPRENEUR The Function of the Entrepreneur . ? If an industrial project is to be carried on , it is not only necessary that certain persons shall be willing to labor and others willing to lend the money with which the laborers may be hired and materials purchased , but it is also essential that someone be willing to undertake the risk of the enterprise . There is almost always some chance of loss in any undertaking . This risk of loss must be borne by some person , or group , who assumes responsibility for the enterprise . The one who thus takes the responsibility for an economic project was very fittingly designated by the early English economists as an undertaker . But the use of this term in another sense made it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the word entrepreneur , which is the French equivalent for undertaker , was employed , and has since been rather generally used by English and American economists . An entrepreneur as well as a capitalist saves and uses his money in business with a view to future gain . The vital difference between the two is that the entrepreneur uses his own money and also money borrowed from capitalists in a business venture , while the capitalist , as a capitalist , merely loans his money to others . The entrepreneur bears the risk of losing what he invests as he can have no security that his venture will succeed ; but the capitalist has the promise of the borrower , who is usually an entrepreneur , that the loan will be repaid . The capitalist may lose his money , but his risk is normally far less than that of the entrepreneur . The entrepreneur is thus a capitalist plus . He saves ? he postpones consumption ? he waits , as does a capitalist ? but he uses his money rather than loans it . An owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer , is an entrepreneur , while the one who owns a mortgage against // the farm is a capitalist ; the purchaser of common stock in a corporation is jointly with other similar purchasers an entrepreneur , but the purchaser of bonds is a capitalist . The difference between the entrepreneur and the capitalist is in many instances very indistinct , and this is especially true in the case of the owners of the securities of corporations , as will be noted in a later chapter , but the difference between the two functions is clear enough in a sufficient number of cases to warrant the classification . The services of the entrepreneur are very significant . Indeed , economic activity is impossible without the exercise of the entrepreneur function by an individual , a group of individuals , or the state . Responsibility for an undertaking must be assumed in every case . The Payment of the Entrepreneur . ? The individual entrepreneur receives payment for his services in the profits of his undertaking , if there are any profits . Strictly speaking , an amount should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for the labor service which he renders in connection with the enterprise and for interest on the money belonging to him which he uses in the business , in order to arrive at the profits that are the reward for his services as an entrepreneur . As in the case of the capitalist , many persons object to paying the entrepreneur . This position , however , can not be successfully defended . Profits come , normally , because an entrepreneur foresees the demand of the community more accurately than other entrepreneurs or other persons who might become entrepreneurs ; or because a particular entrepreneur uses methods that give him an advantage over other entrepreneurs . To act in either of these two ways is to perform a service that deserves a reward . Occasionally , of course , to supply a demand may not be socially desirable , and also not every method that will permit an increase in profits is desirable . But generally speaking , the anticipation of wants and the cheapening of processes are in the interest of economic welfare . The lure of profits promotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the private conduct of industries // would undoult edly he given up in almost all cases . The state could not , undertake to make up all of the possible losses that persons iuiglit have in industries ; and entrepreneurs would certainly not venture their wealth if faced with the chance of loss and with no chance of gain . The alternative to profits is then government ownership and operation of all enterprises . Even t his , however , would not eliminate the risks for which the entrepreneur is paid , nor the payments that are made to him . Under government enterprise a greater charge would have to be made for the products of the lines of industry in which the hazard is great , as in the growing of certain crops , than would be made for the products in less hazardous fields of endeavor . Justice among consumers would make it necessary to do this . Considered as a deduction from the " full product of labor " profits may also be justified . Laborers not only wish to be paid at the time they perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving wages rather than to take chances on getting an income from the profits that may accrue from a business venture . In the fruit tree illustration used above , the risk that it might not grow , or might not bear fruit , or that the fruit could be sold only at a very low price , was eliminated by assumption . To include the risk factor which would certainly be present , it is clear that if the laborer who planted the tree retained possession of it he would not only have to wait for his income from it , but he would also run the risk of not getting anything from it . But if he sells the tree at the time of planting ? if he sets out the tree in return for the payment of wages ? he escapes both the waiting and the risk that arc involved . The buyer of the tree ? the payer of the wages ? does not then exploit the laborer if he pays him less than the final full value of his labor , which is , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by year . If the tree should not yield the amount of fruit that it is reasonably expected to bear , or if the price of fruit should fall unreasonably , the laborer would then have been paid more than the full value of his product . In many cases , entrepreneurs make undue profits ; and in others , they pay wages that are too low . Sometimes these two // conditions are found together . But despite such instances there can be no question as to the general justification of profits , nor , what amounts to the same thing , the practical importance of the function of the entrepreneur . Profits are not only the means by which entrepreneurs are rewarded . At the same time they tend to determine the relative amount of entrepreneur services that will be forthcoming and its distribution among the different industrial fields . If profits are unduly high , more persons are encouraged to undertake the responsibility of conducting enterprises , and this incidentally tends toward a reduction of profits . On the other hand , a marked curtailment of profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this eventually results in raising profits . Similarly , the profits which prevail in the different lines of industry tend to determine the relative supply of entrepreneur services in the different economic fields , for entrepreneurs tend to enter those lines of work in which the rate of profit is relatively high . As was remarked in regard to the rate of interest , profits will be more fully discussed later as one of the shares in the distribution of income . PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES 100 .

TRADE AND SPECIALIZATION In the preceding chapter of this book the point has been emphasized that our economic society is one in which the institution of private property prevails and in which there is a high degree of cooperation among the persons who make up the society . These two conditions , private property and cooperation , can not exist unless trade be carried on . For with private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus cooperate in jointly serving their economic interests except on the basis of a mutual exchange of their services and products . There is specialization in an army , or in a communistic society , of course , without the existence of trade relations , but this specialization is brought about by authority . In a society in which the principle of freedom in economic affairs prevails , specialization is possible only if there is an exchange of products and services . Specialization and trade in a society such as ours are thus related as fundamentally as are the two sides of a coin . The greater the ease with which products or services can be exchanged , the greater is the degree of specialization that is possible . Kinds of Specialization . ? Specialization takes several forms . Probably the form that developed first historically was specialization by trades . In this form of specialization one worker completes the entire series of work processes falling to his lot . Thus a village blacksmith devotes himself entirely to blacksmithing and performs all of the different kinds of work that fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpening plowshares , etc . A farmer is a specialist of this kind for he works at all of the different activities that make up farming . Likewise 149 // the small town doctor is a trade specialist for he treats every type of ailment . Another form of specialization is that growing out of the division of production into different stages . Thus a newly constructed automobile in the hands of the consumer represents the culmination of production by definite stages , reaching from the extraction of the raw materials and their refining to the construction of the machine and its distribution to the consumer . The workers in each of the stages of production confine themselves to the type of work falling in that stage . Thus the miners of the raw ore do nothing but mine ore ; those who transport the ore are engaged only in transportation ; and so on . Geographic specialization is the third form and springs largely from the peculiar characteristics of given geographical districts , causing the people therein to devote themselves largely to one or a few types of production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the northwestern states to wheat growing , certain Massachusetts cities to shoe manufacturing , and certain of the western states to mining activities . One of the outstanding developments of the Industrial Revolution is the fourth type of specialization , known as specialization by tasks . It reaches its most complete expression in a plant such as the Ford Motor Company , where 95 per cent of the workmen do very simple tasks . Each one of these tasks is reduced as nearly as possible to only one movement . One man , for example , will do nothing but insert a particular bolt , while another will do nothing but fasten a nut to this bolt . This specialization by tasks is rapidly increasing to-day with the extension of large scale production and the utilization of automatic machinery . To say that men specialize extensively at various tasks , trades , and occupations is merely to repeat the idea , expressed in previous chapters , that there is a high degree of interdependence among the various workers to-day . Cooperation , interdependence , specialization , and trade are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this aspect of economic life is not of recent origin , but is very , very old , yet the degree to which // men cooperate by specializing and then trading their products is far more marked to-day than ever before in the world 's history . Transportation . ? Very obviously the extent to which trade can be carried on , and thus the extent to which men may specialize in their economic tasks , depends upon the available facilities for transportation . As Adam Smith put it , " The division of labor is limited by the extent of the market . " Waterways naturally played a most important part in the developing of commerce until the time of the railroad . The reason for this is made clear by the following quotation from Smith : " As by means of water-carriage a more extensive market is opened to every sort of industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it , so it is upon the sea-coast , and along the banks of navigable rivers , that industry of every kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that that those improvements extend themselves to the inland parts of the country . A broad-wheeled waggon , attended by two men , and drawn by eight horses , in about six weeks ' time carries and brings back between London and Edinburgh near four ton weight of goods . In about the same time a ship navigated by six or eight men , and sailing between the ports of London and Leith , frequently carries and brings back two hundred ton weight of goods . Six or eight men , therefore , by the help of watercarriage , can carry and bring back in the same time the same quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh , as fifty broad-wheeled waggons , attended by a hundred men , and drawn by four hundred horses . Upon two hundred tons of goods , therefore , carried by the cheapest landcarriage from London to Edinburgh , there must be charged the maintenance of a hundred men for three weeks , and both the maintenance , and , what is nearly equal to the maintenance , the wear and tear of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas , upon the same quantity of goods carried by water , there is to be charged only the maintenance of six or eight men , and the wear and tear of a ship of two hundred tons burden , together with the value of the superior risk , or the difference of the insurance between land and water-carriage . Were there no other communication between those two places , therefore , but by land-carriage , as no goods could be transported from the one to the other , except such whose price was very considerable in proportion to their weight , they could carry on but a small part of that commerce which at present subsists between them , and consequently could give but a small part of that encouragement which they at pros152 SOME FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS ent mutually afford to each other 's industry . There could be little or no commerce of any kind between the distant parts of the world . " 1 Smith 's book , it will be remembered , was published in 1776 , fifty years before the advent of the railroad . To-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile is remarkably cheap . Indeed , it is so cheap that it is generally preferred to water transportation within most areas where both might be used , as , for example , along the Ohio , Mississippi , and Missouri rivers . The cost of transporting a ton of goods a mile in many sections of the country , as stated in earlier chapters , is less than the price of a two-cent postage stamp . This has given to the inland areas a degree of specialization or division of labor which the great Scotch economist of the eighteenth century saw restricted almost entirely to the regions adjacent to seaports and navigable rivers . Not only has inland transportation been greatly improved since 1776 , water transportation , too , has been greatly facilitated . At the time that Smith was writing , the use of steam as power was unknown , and likewise the use of iron or steel in the construction of vessels . Also , special loading devices , which together with the steam-propelled steel vessel make it possible to ship wheat ; on the Great Lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cost of 41 cents per ton , are of recent origin . The barriers of distance have , relatively speaking , been almost entirely removed ? markets have been made incredibly wide . It is because of this that districts and entire countries are able to devote themselves so exclusively to the performance of a very few kinds of work . Similarity of Culture . ? The width of markets depends not alone upon agencies of transportation but , as well , upon a similarity of culture among the people of different sections and of different nations . It is only as customs are similar ? as consumption habits become the same ? that it becomes possible to have wide markets . Transportation is , of course , an important factor in the pro-Footnote // Communication may also be said to be a factor of great importance in this particular . Communication is , in large part , dependent upon transportation , for by means of transportation facilities , travelers and traders , and books and papers make the habits of one people known to another . But aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and specialized instruments of communication such as the telegraph , telephone , and radio all tend toward the widening of the markets of the various districts that are affected . Law and order and the faithful performance of contracts are also vital to the extension of trade and the development of specialization . Large Scale Production . ? Large scale production , which is made possible by the extension of markets , permits a high degree of specialization within the work process . This was referred to above as the specialization of tasks . This point was neatly illustrated several years ago by Professor Commons in a discussion of the meat packing industry . He said , in part , as follows : " It would be difficult to find another industry where division of labor has been so ingeniously and microscopically worked out . The animal has been surveyed and laid off like a map ; and the men have been classified in over thirty specialties and twenty rates of pay from 16 cents to 50 cents an hour . The 50-cent man is restricted to using the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or to using the ax in splitting the backbone ( splitter ) ; and wherever a less skilled man can be slipped in at 18 cents , 182 cents , 20 cents , 21 cents , 221 cents , 24 cents , 25 cents , and so on , a place is made for him and an occupation mapped out . In working on the hide alone there are nine positions at eight different rates of pay . A 20-cent man pulls off the tail , a 222-cent man pounds off another part where the hide separates readily , and the knife of the 40-cent man cuts a different texture and has a different feel ' from that of the 50-cent man . Skill has become specialized to fit the anatomy . " 1 Footnote // The contrast between the specialization which Commons describes and that which is found in a small slaughter house is , of course , very marked . Further , large scale operations encourage managers to devise specialized machinery which permits the specialization of tasks to be developed to a high degree , as was indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cities and Specialization . ? Another condition that results from specialization and also makes possible the extension of specialization is the modern city . Professional men , artisans , and tradesmen of all kinds are able to find a wide market for their services and wares in a city , and hence are able to devote themselves to a narrow specialty . Money and Exchange . ? The direct exchange of goods for goods is called barter . Trade takes this form in primitive communities . But obviously , there is a marked limitation to the carrying on of trade by barter . Such a method means that there must be a fourfold coincidence ? that a person who possesses corn and wishes to trade for a wagon must find another person who possesses a wagon which he desires to exchange for corn . The restriction which barter thus imposes upon the exchange of goods leads very early in the experience of most peoples to the utilization of a " medium of exchange , " that is , to the use of money . Money makes it possible for one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that he desires from the persons who possess them . Trade and , hence , specialization are accordingly greatly facilitated by the use of money . Without money it is inconceivable that there could be a degree of specialization at all approaching that which prevails with us to-day . It is one of the most important single agencies in our economic society : " It is one of the greatest inventions of all ages . " ' The importance of money sometimes leads to erroneous conclusions concerning its nature . For example , expenditures for public improvements have been defended on the ground that if the money is spent within the country there is no loss , even if the improvements are worthless ; or during wars , and as well Footnote // at other times , the issuance of paper money by the government has been advocated as a means of reducing , or eliminating entirely , the cost to the nation of doing the task that is to be done . The fact that money is a medium of exchange , that it is merely a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of persons is fundamentally barter , should prevent one from making such statements . Clearly , if labor and materials are used in constructing a dam , or dredging a river , or erecting a fortification , or bombing an enemy city , a social cost has been incurred , regardless of how the money that was expended was secured , or where it was spent ; and if the product is useless , then there has been an unprofitable ? an unwise ? use of labor , service , and materials . That is , labor and materials in such a case are unwisely exchanged for the product that is secured . Confusion in thought relative to the nature of trade and money has also led to error in comparing domestic with foreign commerce . During the period of mercantilism , the argument was made that domestic trade could not enrich a nation because it did not increase the amount of gold and silver bullion within the country . This argument has been repeated occasionally since that time . But gold and silver when used as money are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money in a community is vital to the efficient conduct of enterprise , a point can easily be reached beyond which it is far less advisable to increase the supply of money than the supply of goods . Indeed , it is possible that conditions may be such that an addition to the supply of money will be positively detrimental to the welfare of a society , as will be more fully noted in a later chapter . But entirely aside from any consideration of the supply of money , it follows from what was said at the beginning of this chapter that domestic trade is a necessary part of the process of specialization by which an entire nation gains the advantages that come from utilizing the resources of the various regions of the country and the specialized ability of the different persons within its borders . A very considerable factor in making pos156 SOME FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS sible the high standard of living in the United States has been the free and unrestricted trade among all the parts of the extensive area of the nation . Credit Exchange . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , without the use of money . Indeed , a very large part of the exchange transactions in the United States while being in terms of money do not involve the use of money . They are credit transactions . Some credit transactions , however , may mean only the postponement of money payment and thus are not complete credit transactions . This is true of a large volume of exchanges in the United States to-day . The simplest case of the completion of an exchange entirely on the basis of credit would be a situation in which each of two persons sold goods to the other on credit ? the two accounts finally exactly balancing . A cancellation of the two debts would then be possible . In that way the exchanges would have been conducted entirely on credit . Such a case is illustrative of what may be called postponed barter . Due to the difficulty of carrying on exchange by barter , this use of credit can not be of much consequence . But if a large number of traders could pool their debts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible for them to buy and sell freely among themselves and to make settlement in large part at least by mutual cancellation of debts . That is , A may owe B , while B owes H , H owes Z , Z owes C , and C owes A. If each of these debts was for the same amount , the cancellation of all of them would be satisfactory to all of the claimants , and this would mean that the transactions had all been carried on and settled by means of credit ? without the use of money . Banking institutions make it possible for the debts of buyers , or credits granted buyers by sellers , to be settled by mutual cancellation somewhat after the manner of the illustration just given . Firms and individuals having accounts ( money ) in banks usually pay their bills with checks , and for the most part the sums specified to be paid are not drawn out in money but are transferred through a process of cancellation from the account of one person to that of another person , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of our economic life will be more fully discussed in the chapters devoted to money and banking . When Is Specialization Advisable ? ? The prices that prevail indicate when specialization is advisable to an individual or a group of persons , if the largest economic gain is to be secured . If a man can earn $5000 practicing law , while his services as a stenographer would command only $2500 , it is clearly advisable for him to devote himself exclusively to the work of a lawyer rather than spend any part of his time at stenography . In other words , it is better for him to specialize at the work of a lawyer and hire a stenographer rather than attempt to do such work for himself . It is on the basis of a similar common-sense comparison among different alternatives that most individuals choose a specialty and devote themselves to it . But sometimes this simple price test is abandoned in popular discussion and the position is taken that whether specialization is advisable depends upon whether one is more efficient than another at a given task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that if the lawyer is more efficient as a stenographer than is the person whom he hires , it will then be better for him to do his own stenographic work . A simple illustration , however , will show that such a test would not guide the lawyer to do the work that will give him the largest economic income . He may be a very efficient stenographer , in fact , better than anyone else ; but he may also be an efficient lawyer . While he may not be among the best lawyers , he may be good enough so that he can make much more at devoting himself to legal work than he can if he works at stenography either all of the time or only part of the time . The choice turns , then , not upon a comparison of the relative efficiency of different persons at a given task , but upon the relative efficiency of one person at different tasks . This principle is often stated in terms of costs . If the lawyer can make ten dollars per day as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half day , the cost to him of the stenographic work which he does will be five dollars . If he can hire someone to do this work // in a day 's time at the rate of four dollars per day , he will find it advisable to hire the work done , even though it takes the stenographer all day to do what he could do in half a day . The comparative costs to the lawyer of the two ways of doing the work would be unequal in this case . The lesser of the two would be incurred when he hires someone to do the stenographic work , while he devotes himself to legal affairs . There may , of course , be considerations other than that of economic gain in determining the advisability of specialization . Many men prefer to do several different tasks rather than only one . Disinterested observers insist that the extreme specialization that is so characteristic of our society to-day is detrimental to welfare . Assuming that there is a net advantage in favor of our prevailing high degree of specialization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in well-being to many persons by forcing them to engage in repetitive operations that are very monotonous . Trade Compels Men to Specialize . ? Exchange relations not only make it possible for men to specialize at various tasks , it forces such specialization upon them . In the case of the lawyer considered above , it is necessary for him to specialize if he is to serve his economic interests . He , however , might choose to do his own stenographic work and make less money than he could make by devoting himself more exclusively to the practice of law . But in the case of different geographic regions there is but little , if any , choice in the matter of specialization so far as most business men are concerned . In New England , for example , it is economically impossible for very much wheat to be grown . Trade relations with the Northwest force the people of New England to do something other than raise wheat . Let us assume that men can make four dollars per day working in manufacturing plants in that region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in the fields . But at this rate per day it is impossible , in view of the low soil fertility in New England , for farmers to produce much wheat and stay out of bankruptcy . Their expenses per bushel would be in excess of the price that they could get in view of the competition of the // wheat producers of the Northwest . And the expense of raising wheat , be it noted , depends upon what can be made in the manufacturing industry . Trade relations thus force the people of New England to specialize very largely at manufacturing and to purchase their wheat from outside their borders . This situation can easily be stated in terms of comparative costs . The comparative costs to the people of New England of the two ways of getting wheat ? raising it themselves or producing something else and then buying it ? are unequal with the lesser of the two being in the method of purchase with money secured by the production and sale of something else . Also , of course , the comparative costs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting wheat are unequal , but in this case the lower cost is incurred if wheat is produced rather than purchased with the proceeds of some other line of production . Likewise , the comparative costs of the two methods of getting shoes are different to the people of these two regions ? being lower to the people of New England if shoes are produced , and lower to the people of the Northwest if shoes are purchased with the income received from wheat farming . Further , even if one of these two communities were superior to the other in the production of both of these commodities , specialization would be advantageous for this community if it were more superior in the producing of one ' ' commodity than in the producing of the other , as was shown above in the illustration of the lawyer-stenographer . A further illustration is perhaps in point . Suppose that a region such as California is superior to other regions in the manufacture of shoes , and is largely engaged in that specialty . Suppose , further , that it is then found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruit . It would then , we may assume , be more efficient than other regions in the production of both shoes and fruit , but relatively more efficient in the production of the latter . This would then tend to cause all persons engaged in the shoe business to leave that occupation and begin growing and shipping fruit . In terms of wages , the superiority at shoe manufacturing may be assumed
