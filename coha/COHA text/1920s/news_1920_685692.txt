txt It is good law and common sense that the members of Congress should have lafge immunity for statements made on the floor . Popular myths are exploded in that way , because there are always plenty of members to draw out the facts and make the loose talker look ridiculous . But no immunity has ever been extended to candidates for Congress or for the Presidency . Governor Cox pleads such an immunity . He charges his opponents with collecting a fund of $15,000.000 to corrupt the voters . This is a statutory offense , involving the subscribers , the collectors and the distributors . Challenged to prove his statement , Governor Cox says : " I think it will he recognized that as a candidate I have the right to make such use of the information I have as may seem desirable . " " Seem desirable " to whom ? To the man who utters the libel ? Or to the officers of justice prepared to consider his or anybody 's evidence as to the commission of a crime ? The Kenyon committee , formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for use in the primaries , is still in existence . It has invited Governor Cox to substantiate his charges . If he could substantiate them , is there the slightest doubt that he would do so instantly ? The only inference is that he is making loose statements without evidence , in a way often done by Democratic candidates before . Obviously he does not like being pinned to chapter and verse . But what Governor Cox'likes or dislikes is beside the point . The Kenyon committee has ample power to call witnesses , including Cox . It should forthwith proceed to do so . Ile is not the judge as to when , where or how these charges should be passed upon . Is there no Democratic campaign fund ? So far as the facts of record go , the Republican party managers and its candidate have limited the amount of a subscription to $1,000 , with the fullest publicity for contributors and for the expenditure of the money . The Democratic party has all the jobholders in the country to draw upon , and their tenure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding is elected that they may he expected , even without solicitation , to pay insurance on their jobs . And the Democratic party has specifically refused to limit contributions . Are there no profiteers emerging front the war , rich beyond their fondest dreams , who are prepared , in this way , to pay for immunity and silence ? They got something else than nitrates out of the air . The costly construction of camps , the extravagant purchases of worthless building sites , the launching of wooden steam -- cm which sailors refuse tit navigate , ? these and countless other things were done under Democratic patronage . Ni , wonder Governor Cox is not worrying about his own campaign fund ! Nothing iv to be hoped from the Department of tire . But the Kenyon committee can nail this lie to the counter . Governor Cox himself discarded all rules of fair play ** started shouting " Foul ! " before the campaign opened . There will he nothing unsportsmanlike in placing him in the witness box . If you are asked 25 cents for sugar do n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less if you will take the trouble to look for them .
