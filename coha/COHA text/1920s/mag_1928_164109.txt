Thirteen of those 15 grave men who have been directing the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Railway Co. to crescent prosperity last week made themselves comfortable in the directors ' room of the company 's Manhattan suite and , having digested the predigested reports of the road 's efficacy during the past year , made a decision which they knew would be pleasing to their stockholders who are to meet at Topeka , Kan. , the last Thursday of this month . <P> Among those Atchison directors are such bishops of U. S. finance as : William Benson Storey , President of the Atchison ; Edward Julius Berwind , Manhattan holder of coal , shipping and transportation enterprises ; William Chapman Potter , President of the Guaranty Trust of Manhattan ; Arthur Twining Hadley , President Emeritus of Yale ; Charles Steele , Morgan partner ; Henry Smith Pritchett , President of the Carnegie Foundation since 1906 ; and Myron Charles Taylor , Chairman of U. S. Steel 's finance committee . <P> Their prudence is undebatable . Last week they raised the dividend rate on Atchison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this rate would be maintained for many a year . <P> The Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe is the richest of U. S. railroads . Its assets are approximately a billion and a quarter dollars . It has 2,324,095 shares of common stock outstanding . Great institutions as well as little people own that stock . It yields them now $23,240,950 each year . <P> And 33 years ago the road was bankrupt , made so by the panic of 1893 . A foreclosure sale wiped out hobbling debts ; a new management revitalized it . Someone with good persuasive powers brought the late Edward Payson Ripley ( 1845-1920 ) , to be its president . Ever since , the Atchison has paid its preferred dividends . Common dividends began in 1901 , with $3.50 . They changed successively to $4 $4.50 , $6 , $5 , $5.50 , $6 , then ( 3 years ago ) $7 . For more than a year there have been extra $3 dividends on the common stock . That extra-fruit of " Old Man " Ripley 's tillage , of present President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week regularized.
