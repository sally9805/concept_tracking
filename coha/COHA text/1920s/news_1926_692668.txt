txt Dealing With the Turks . There is a point where we think the advocates of the ratification of the treaty with Turkey are greatly mistaken . We Armenians have lived with the Turks for centuries and we are supposed to know something about their psychology . The Turk respects one who shows real energy and power and at the same time deals Justly , and despises him who shows him favor because he fears his mischief . The European nations have learned this by sad experience over and over again . We , hope the United States will not ignore this phase of the Turk 's mentality , Even If the treaty is to be ratified , let it be in such a way that the Turk will not feel that America Is helpless before him , or because the Americans are afraid that the Turks will drive the missionaries out of the land and close their schools or massacre the remaining Armenians . Since the American victory in the great war the Turks have been holding a very ' high opinion of America 's influence In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the treaty may be ratified not lessen this respect the Turk has for the United States .
