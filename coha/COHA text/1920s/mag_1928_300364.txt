A red flower upon the coat lapel is the authentic badge of Bolshevism , but even this fact does not dissuade the Grand Duke Alexander Michailovitch Romanov-surviving cousin and brother-in-law of Tsar Nicholas the Last-from wearing whenever he chooses a red boutonniere . Thus last week His Imperial Highness , who is now lecture-touring U. S. cities , received smart Manhattanites in his suite at the Hotel Ritz with a blood-red rosebud peeping from his buttonhole . The thing was urbanely and genuinely done . " I am of no party , " smiled the Grand Duke , and presently charmed his guests by chatting not only of himself and Russia but about the two other Romanov grand dukes who were most in the public eye , last week : 1 ) The Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch , onetime Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armies on the Western Front ( 1914-15 ) and brother-in-law of Queen Elena of Italy , who lay in a dying condition last week at Nice ; and 2 ) The Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovitch , grandson-in-law of British Queen Victoria , who continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in succession to his assassinated cousin Tsar Nicholas II . &; Last . <P> Terrible Things ! Ensconced at the Ritz , last week , Grand Duke Alexander said , in fluent but slightly stilted English : " A proletarian visited me this morning . Yes , a proletarian-the clothes very rough and dirty ! He had just returned from Russia . He told me terrible things ! . . . But I look-the Imperial Family looks-for a change . <P> " You ask how this will come . I think it must come through Spirituality , through the awakening of all Russians to universal oneness with the Spirit Supreme . . . . That is my doctrine , the subject of my books and lectures . . . When that awakening has taken place Russia will have found herself . Then there may be a Head-some one man above others ( gesturing in the air ) - but perhaps very different from the Tsar . What will it matter , then ? " <P> " Tsar Cyril . " Unlike most expounders of Spirituality , the Grand Duke Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paced toweringly about his hotel drawing-room , last week , it was not hard to see him as once he was , as the stern quarterdecker , " The Admiral of the Fleet " to Tsar Nicholas the Last . <P> When asked in whom the Imperial succession should now reside , he rapped : " Unquestionably in the Grand Duke Cyril ! If it is a question of law-of right-he must be Tsar . Who else ? The Grand Duke Nicholas-no ! <P> " What is Cyril doing ? He is not exactly doing-he is making propaganda . Only little pamphlets ! Books are impossible-he can not get them into Russia . . . . We are good friends . Very often I go to see him and explain my ideas . He does not go so far toward Spirituality as I do-but more or less . He is more anxious to make propaganda and tell the people he is Tsar . " <P> Popular Nicholas . A trace of resentment was shown by the Grand Duke Alexander in speaking of his cousin the Grand Duke Nicholas : " Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason why anybody thinks he should be Tsar . He is too old ! He is exactly 72 . I saw it in the New York Times , this morning , where they say he is very sick on the Riviera . Such an old man could not have the strength to lead such a cause .
