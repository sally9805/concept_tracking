N editorial on the Ruhr occupation in the May number of the North American Review presents the following picture of the conduct of the French in the invaded terri  --  tory : One of the achievements of great significance and moral value , thus far to be credited to the French occupation of the Ruhr , is the fine vindication of France herself . The inexorable resolution with which she entered upon that policy has been fully matched by the moderation , the self-restraint , even the considerate kindness toward the vanquished which have marked her execution of it . In striking contrast to the swaggering brutality of the German army of occupation after the war of 1370-71 , the French have borne themselves with a courtesy and clemency , even in the face of atrocious provocation , such as probably no other people have ever shown in like circumstances . The most impressive testimony to this effect has been given by the Germans of the Ruhr themselves , who have generally acquiesced in the occupation , save as they were incited from Berlin to commit murders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this glorification of the humane methods and aims pursued by the French in occupying the Ruhr , I shall not enter into the right or wrong of the Ruhr occupation itself . This question seems to me to have been settled by the note of the British Government of August 11 , 1923 , affirming its illegality under the Treaty of Versailles . Nor shall I enumerate the frequent acts of murder and other outrages committed by the French and Belgian troops in the Ruhr and Rhineland ever since the invasion was undertaken . These acts were the natural concomitants of a policy of military aggression . What I am going to speak about is a question of the admin  --  istration of justice in the invaded territory , the question : What has been the fate of the hundreds of German citizens who upon one charge or another were arrested by the French or Belgian authorities ? How were they treated when arrested ? How were they brought to trial ? What was their lot in prison ? The material from which I have drawn is all documen  --  tary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Red Cross sent out to study prison conditions in the occupied territory or of sworn statements of prison ? =ers made before the regular German courts or other authori  --  ties . I owe this material to the courtesy of the president of the German Red Cross , Herr von Winterfeld , and his assistant , Herr von Esebeck . It would have been easy to multiply the cases by scores and scores . The few cases selected by me from the large mass of material placed at my disposal stand each for a numerous class of similar cases , and together are typical of the whole situation . I shall present the subject under four main heads : First , reports about French prison management in general . Sec  --  ond , reports about the treatment of hostages imprisoned in reprisal for actual or alleged acts of German sabotage . Third , sworn statements of persons arrested , but released without trial . Fourth , sworn statements of persons arrested , tried , and imprisoned for shorter or longer terms . J have taken care to rule out testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have erred by giving preference to testimony of marked moderation and restraint . For a general report on prison conditions under French rule , I select a comparatively favorable statement made to a Red Cross representative by former inmates of the prison at Germersheim in the Bavarian Palatinate . This state  --  ment was made at the request of the prisoners still there , since they had no chance to talk with the Red Cross repre  --  sentative except in the presence of the French prison offi  --  cials . The chief points of this statement , dated June 2 , 1923 , are the following : The individual treatment of the prisoners in Germersheim is better than elsewhere . Never  --  theless , there is much room for improvement in the gen  --  eral management . In particular , the food is entirely inade  --  quate . The Red Cross is allowed to furnish two pounds of bread per week to each person , but this amount is deducted from the daily prison ration . It often happens that the Moroccan prison guards before the very eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soup . The table utensils are usually dirty . In consequence of undernourish  --  ment , 70 to 80 per cent of the prisoners are virtually ill . Nevertheless , it rarely happens that a prisoner petitions to be placed on the sick list , since that usually leads to a still further reduction of food , prohibition of the daily walk , and similar retrenchments . The sanitary conditions are extremely bad . On account of the overcrowding of the prison , the shower bath can be used by a given individual only at long weeks ' intervals . Instead of being allowed to use the lavatory , the prisoners must attend to their evacua  --  tions within their cells , in pails with loose covers . Of visi  --  tors , only relatives bearing the same family name are gen  --  erally admitted ; others have the greatest difficulty in secur  --  ing admission . The prisoners resent the fact that food , clothing , and books sent by the Red Cross are distributed by the guards not only among the political prisoners , but equally and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . As particulars of prison life will fully come to light in the account of individual experiences which I shall cite later , I shall refrain from dwelling on other reports of a general character . I rather proceed at once to a specific and par  --  ticularly aggravating account of French prison manage  --  ment , an account of how German hostages , i. e. , citizens arrested in order to bring pressure upon a whole com  --  community , are treated under French military prison rule . During the night of June 29-30 , 1923 , a very deplorable disaster happened on the railway bridge crossing the Rhine near the city of Duisburg : an explosion on a Belgian mili  --  tary train , killing and wounding scores of soldiers . The cause of the explosion was obscure . The railway track was practically undamaged , no suspicious person had been seen on it . On the other hand , the train had carried ammunition ; this ammunition exploded  --  was it not well to investigate whether the explosion had come from within or without ? The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that it had come from without , that this was a case of German conspiracy , that the city of Duisburg was implicated and must be punished for the crime . The chair  --  man of the local Duisburg Red Cross committee , under date of July 7 , reports : In consequence of the deplorable event on'the llochfeld bridge during the night of June 29-30 , more than twenty prominent citizens of Duisburg have been arrested as hostages by the military authorities and have been quartered in the Duisburg court prison . These hostages are deprived of all advantages , even the smallest , which are accorded even to criminal prisoners arrested on whatever charge . Although the hostages have now been kept in prison for a whole week , they have not , like the other prisoners , been allowed a daily walk in the prison court  --  yard . The denial of this small chance for exercise , ordinarily granted to even the worst criminals , affects the hostages all the more terribly since they have been crowded with other prisoners , three , even four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , so that even within their cells they have hardly any chance to move about . The air in these cells is intolerable , all the more so since all the inmates must attend to their evacuations in the cell . The hostages are entirely separated from the ' outer world . No relative , no clergyman , no representative of the Red Cross is allowed to see them . Only the prison physician is admitted to the sick among them , and this only in the presence of a Belgian guard . The hostages are not allowed to receive fresh underclothing from relatives . They are not allowed to do any reading . It is a clear demand of humanity that the hostages , who belong to the foremost families of the city and are mostly of advanced age , should not , by being treated worse than criminal prisoners , be made to suffer intolerable physical and mental tortures . This demand of humanity is all the more urgent since the hostages , in common with the whole Duisburg com  --  community , most severely condemn the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime , and not an accident , and would have done everything in their power to prevent it if they had had the slightest inkling of it . ( Signed ) STEINBACK , Chairman , Red Cross Committee for the Care of Prisoners . I now pass on to- sworn statements of persons arrested by French or Belgian soldiers , taken to guard-houses , but soon released without trial . To judge from the large number of such statements collected by the Red Cross  --  they run into the hundreds  --  such arrests and speedy releases belonged for months to the daily occurrences in the Ruhr . Whether they are as frequent now I can not tell . The main point in all these cases is not the arrest itself or the subsequent re  --  lease , but the way in which the victims were treated in the interval by the French and Belgian soldiery . From a mass of similar cases I select a few belonging to the months of February and March . They are almost monotonous in the repetition of the same revolting details. * Police Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - District Court on February 12 , 1923 , under oath , as follows : February 7 , toward 11 p.m. , I was on my round in Haltern Street . At the corner of Spring Street I was halted by a French guard . I was accompanied by Police Officer Stermans . In. front of us some civilians were walking , one of whom called out : " Deutschland , Deutschland tilor Alles ! " I was accused of having sung : " Deutschland , Deutschland fiber Alles , " which was not the case . I was taken to the Churchyard School , where a French Alpine chasseur thrust me into the guard-room . Several civilians were already there . I was told to stand in the corner , away from the civilians . After about ten minutes two non-commissioned officers appeared and told me to step into the middle of the room . They then belabored me with kicks and fisticuffs without giving any reason for it . Only one of them said in a questioning tone : " Deutschland , Deutsch land caber Alles ? " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said : " Deutschland , Deutschland unter Alles ! " Then the other soldier lifted me up and kept on maltreating * The medical certificates about injuries received , which accompany these testimonies , it seemed hardly worth while to reproduce.me , kicking me in my back and sides and beating me with his fist in the face , so that I almost lost my hearing . Even now . it is hard for me to hear . Then I was told to stand in the corner again . A broom was pressed into my hand and I was told to sweep the room , while they called out at me : " Capital  --  ist ! Nationalist ! " The room was also a place of detention for arrested French soldiers . These looked on while I was being maltreated , laughed and clapped their hands . Mean  --  while Police Officers Stermans , Ficht , and Pauli had also been brought in . We were ordered to sit on . the bare , dirty floor . This we did and finally we stretched out for sleep . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers were examined . About 5 p.m. three mining students were brought in . These were placed with the face against the wall and had to stand at attention . As soon as any one of them moved a foot , the guard standing behind them knocked him with the butt of his gun against the legs . At 7 p.m . I and the other police officers were dismissed . The officer who discharged us told us to keep our mouths shut . The following is sworn testimony of a Bochum railway official , Ludwig Riibsamen , made at the Bochum Court March 8 : Sunday morning about 9 o'clock a troop of 15 to 20 French soldiers and two French civilians appeared at my house . They asked whether I was yardmaster R. , and when I answered in the affirmative , they arrested me , shouting : " Sabotage , sabotage ! " A search of my house and office yielded a receipt from the railway administration at Hanover for plans and maps sent by me there . At this there arose again the shout : " Sabotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was put in shackles on the street . In front of Section 37 of the Bochum railway yard there stood some boxes belonging to the yard which had been dug out by the French on that spot . What their contents were , I could not ascertain . The French pointed at the boxes and again shouted : " Sabotage ! " At the same time a French civilian knocked me with a heavy stick over the temple so that I toppled over . Then the troop took me to the square in front of the railway station , where I was left standing , guarded by soldiers , until 12 o'clock . At that time an auto-truck , con  --  taining the aforesaid boxes , drew up and took me to the Oberrealschule . Here I was brought before an officer , who ex  --  amined me as to my identity . Then , after having been locked up in the cellar for some time , I was brought before a French civilian official , who examined me again , took my finger-prints , and put down my statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was then taken by auto , with three other prisoners , to Weitmar , near Bochum . In Weitmar I was locked up with three others in a single cell . Then , being handcuffed once more , I was taken to a private house for still another examination . During this examination , in which I could only repeat my former statement that I knew nothing about the boxes , a French civilian , standing behind me , in order to force some confession out of me , repeatedly struck me over the head with a heavy stick . At this , some French civilians present said : " This is not the way to treat decent people , " and indignantly left the room . Next morning there was still another examination , again leading to nothing . Then I was provisionally discharged , without apologies for the injuries received , and with the warning that , if further exca  --  vations of the military authorities should bring more objects to light , my wife would be expelled without any of her household belongings and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious maltreatments may briefly be referred to . On March 7 a sixteen-year-old pupil of the Oberrealschule at Reckling  --  hausen , Ferdinand Basch , was knocked down on the street by French Alpine chasseurs on the groundless allegation of having distributed pamphlets . For some time he lay un  --  conscious . When he regained consciousness , he found him self in the guard-room of the city hall . He was pressed by questions ; and , not being able to make any revelation , he was knocked over the head , pounded in the face , spat at , thrown on the floor . Thus he was left for the night . Early in the morning he managed to escape . About 12 o'clock in the night of March 20-21 Professor H. , in crossing the Lippe bridge at Dorsten was halted by Belgian guards and asked for his passport . While the Belgians examined his papers , a French customs inspector stepped up , took the papers from the Belgians , read them by the light of a street lantern , and exclaiming : " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist on the left eye , knocking him down thereby . Having pulled himself together again , the professor was led into the guard-house of the bridge , where the Belgian soldiers present fell upon him and mercilessly maltreated him . Later he was taken to the Duisburg prison , but , since nothing could be found against him , discharged . A medical examination showed that he had lost the sight of his left eye . I shall close with a category of testimonies which is per  --  haps the most damaging of all , since in these cases even the excitement of the moment can not be adduced as a miti  --  gating circumstance for cruel treatment : testimonies of persons , sentenced to longer or shorter terms of imprison  --  ment , about their experiences during the transport to the prison and their daily prison routine . On March 27 , before the French military court at Diissel  --  dorf , Postmaster Triimpler of Hiickeswagen , a little town south of Elberfeld , was tried for disobedience to military orders . Wherein this disobedience consisted , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-office officials for " disobedience , " he may have refused to attend to mail matters for the French . At any rate no criminal act was involved . At the trial , Trampler declared that as a man of honor and as a German official he could not have acted otherwise . The French public prosecutor designated the case as slight and asked for one month imprisonment and a fine of 300,000 marks . The court , however , fixed the sentence at three months and 600,000 marks . From here on I give Triimpler 's story in his own words : On April 2 , i.e. , six days after the trial , which I spent in the military prison at Diisseldorf , I was called at 4 o'clock a.m. and told to get ready for the transport to Zweibriicken ( in the Bavarian Palatinate ) . With about forty-five other prisoners , three each of whom were manacled together , I was taken in an auto-truck escorted by Moroccan soldiers to the station and there placed in a third-class railway coach . About 6 o'clock the train started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonn , etc. , with long stops at each station , and reached Mainz at 10:30 p.m. , where the escort , consisting of gendarmes and infantry , changed . Here our chains were taken off . We had worn them uninterruptedly during the whole trip , a circumstance which made locomotion , eating , etc. , very difficult and , for instance , forced each manacled taco to go together if one of them had to go to the closet . The food which we received during the trip had been arranged for by the Dtisseldorf Red Cross . We reached Ludwigshafen at midnight and stayed there till 9:30 . Yiext morning , crowded together in such a manner that there was no chance for sleep . In Neustadt and Landau there were again stops of several hours . In Landau the French train people called a crowd of black soldiers to our coach , pointed us out to them , and joined with them in making fun of us . At 9 p.m. we reached Zweibriicken . Escorted by black soldiers , we were marched , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prison . When on the way I translated an order of the French gendarme marching at our side to athrust into the unlighted rooms . remained lying outside . I got with four others into a cell , entirely dark and very cold . The window was open , and as we could not see enough to find out what the mechanism of closing it was , we had to leave it open . I stumbled upon a bedstead with a seaweed mattress , which , as I saw the next day , was soiled all over with blood stains . Except a short , ragged , diaphanously thin blanket , there was nothing on it . During the last part of the trip we had greatly suffered from thirst . In the cell there was not a drop of water . I was shaking with cold and , like my comrades , slept next to nothing . The next forenoon about 11 o'clock , some eatables were handed to us through the shutter of the door : boiled potatoes , with a small piece of boiled beef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , about three , we were told to step in front of the cell to have our things searched once more . Everything of our belongings was taken away , except the clothes themselves and a pillow , blanket , and some food which the Red Cross had furnished for our trip . These were thrown at our feet with contemptuous gestures . Then , for the first time , we got water for drinking and washing , but in dirty vessels . Towels we got only a fortnight later through the Red Cross . In the closet there was only a broken piece of a cover , so that an intolerable stench spread in our cell . An old convict jacket , which we found in the cell and fastened over the seat of the closet , was taken away by the guards with insulting remarks . Later in the afternoon of the same day we received some rice soup and a piece of bread . Early the next day the shutter was suddenly opened . As we did not immediately stand at attention , we were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of repetition would never get anything but bread and water ; whereupon the shutter flung back again . Later on we did get coffee regularly in the morning . But the daily food ration remained entirely inadequate throughout and the meals were often so revolting that both in the forenoon and the afternoon ' nothing could be done with it except pour it into the closet , so that actually we often lived for days together on dry bread and water . From fellow-prisoners I heard that the cooking was done by Moroccans . On April 20 ? I had meanwhile been transferred to a cell with nine inmates ? I was attacked by violent diarrhea . I did not care to report to the French physician , because he had treated other prisoners with disdain and neglect and even designated them as makebeliefs . A few days later a German physician was admitted . So , on April 24 , I reported to him . He recognized my case as dysentery and promised to see to it that I would be given sick diet and be transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick diet through the Red Cross , but the transfer to a hospital came to nothing , the prison administration objecting to it . After two days , during which I had to use the same closet vessel with my eight cell comrades , I was placed in a single cell . Here I had my meals in common with a diphtheritic patient . Once we had to eat from the same dish ; once , in consequence of neglect by the guards , we were for twenty-four hours without food . A little night vessel , entirely inadequate for a proper and sanitary evacuation , served as a closet in this cell . This I had to rinse myself in the common sink . After three weeks , during which I received good Red Cross diet , my bowels improved . From that time on I was permitted to have the regular Red Cross fare accorded to convalescents above fifty years of age . It should be added that general prison conditions had im  --  proved at this time , due to representations made by the Swedish Red Cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Protestant Consistory of Bavaria , who had all visited and inspected the Zweibriicken prison . On June 11 , at three o'clock in the morning , I was taken by a gendarme to the railway station , and thence via Landau to Germersheim . There the gendarme led me across the Rhine bridge and dismissed me , saying that I was expelled from the occupied territory . My question whether I was to have this order in writing was answered in the negative . I am not one of those who fight hatred with hatred . I belong to those who believe that only by toleration and rea  --  son can moral progress in the relation between nations as well as individuals be achieved . As a believer in toleration and reason I deplore the seeds of hatred which France has been sowing and is now sowing in the Ruhr and the Rhine  --  land . What can be achieved by a policy of toleration and reason is strikingly proved by the friendly feelings and sincere regrets with which the Rhineland population accom  --  panied the departure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now there is a chance for American public opinion to be of still greater service to the cause of toleration and reason by helping to put an end to this vicious and ruinous policy of hatred in the Ruhr and Rhine  --  land .
