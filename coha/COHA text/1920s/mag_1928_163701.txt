The Lion and the Mouse . " Father , I love her " and " Now I must act " fell on the ears of the audience at the Vitaphone 's latest offering . They were uttered boldly and flatly by a weak-chinned young cinemactor named William Collier Jr . He played the son of Wall Street 's rich and cruel lion ( Lionel Barrymore ) . The girl he loved ( May McAvoy ) was the daughter of an innocent judge that the lion had ruined financially . The throbbing drama , an old one , was arranged so that the end was happy . It was an unfortunate vehicle for the Vitaphone ; the lines were terrible , making the audience laugh in tense moments . The girl had a throaty voice . Only Lionel Barrymore sounded convincing . He is the Vitaphone 's best bet at the present stage of development . Women 's voices are the most annoying problem ; they either take on a lisp , or else they sound husky . <P> A Certain Young Man . Made two years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramon Novarro starts out with a monocle , a mustache , a high hat , a wife ( Renee Adoree ) . In short , he is a smart Englishman . For the love of a U. S. girl ( Marceline Day ) he throws away the above accoutrements and woos her in the accepted manly fashion . The film should have remained in cold storage . <P> <P> Fools for Luck . Well , if it is n't W. C. Fields and Chester Conklin , again . Goodness me , how those boys are turning out the cinemae . This time , Mr. Fields is an oil stock salesman from the big city . He dupes the folk of Huntersville , including its richest inhabitant ( Mr. Conklin ) . But Nature , happily , brings oil to Mr. Fields ' long dry wells . Slapstick , rather sour .
