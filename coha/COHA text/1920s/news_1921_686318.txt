txt ' THE SILVER CRIME OF 1921 . ' Comments on the Sale and Purchase of Silver by the Treasury . To the Editor of The New York Times : In , justice to the silver producers of the United ' States , who are interested in the Treasury purchases of silver , certain statements in your leading article , " The Silver Crime oft 1921 " of date , should not go unchallenged . Silver producers and traders today are not interested in bimetallism . Your references to President Hayes and President Cleveland ar ? - not pertinent to the issue . But as a matter of information , of imbortanbe to ' the public , I take the liberty:of quoting - the following reference to . silver from the Trade Supplement of The London Times of Feb. 5 : " The question of refixing the heavily I depreciated Continental currencies in a new ratio to gold can not , of course , be ' touched until budgets are equated , but when equation has been made it will probably.be found that gold will not be . in sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that silver will , temporarily at any rate , have to be resorted to in some cases in order to provide a definite measure of value in some commodity . The use of silver , however , would be a relatively poor substitute for gold , since the silver exchanges would fluctuate widely in terms of gold and vice versa . But silver would be a deal better than paper as . a measure of value . " You state : " It seems to have escaped attention that silver now is demoralizing our currency in a similar manner , and that the Treasury is borrowing money , when it has a floating debt of two billions , in order to buy silver at nearly twice its worth for coinage of dollars which nobody wants , or at least which nobody needs for currency . " . It was up to ' the Treasury and Congress to have sold the ' silver dollars outright to the British Government . The fact remains that they did not do no ? for very pertinent reasons . To those who know the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason is quite clear . The British Indian Government started negotiations at a time when silver was in great demand . Producers in the United States and our companies who controlled production in Mexico , Canada , Peru and Chile could have fixed their own price in any negptiations with the Indian Government for several years to come . But the silver was needed urgently . Producers , just as much . as the Administration , were quite willing to help an ally In a time of stress . But they felt that $1 an ounce was far below the right price , and not equitable . Congress , again , did not feel inclined to get rid of the dollars " which nobody wants " at a time when silver values were rising . - Therefore an arrangement , which was considered just until now , was made , according to which the Government agreed to purchase silver and recoin dollars , and producers of silver in the United States were assured of $1 per ounce for a period of about four years , under the Pittman act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British . Indian Government paid at the rate of $1 an ounce for the silver it . purchased , and the amount is included in the total of . advances to Great Britain . The special arrangements entered into for the provision of Indian exchange to us are of little value at present , because Indian exchange has declined heavily . On the silver shipped to China under the Pittman act during the three months beginning December , 1019 , the Treasury obtained $1.29 an ounce and an additional profit besides . The producers co-operated with the Government at great sacrifice to themselves . Silver was the one metal that was controlled before there was time to profiteer in it . The increase in price in 1919 took place after the war , and was mainly at the cost of China . That the suggestion of the repudiation of the Government 's engagements to the producers should come at a time when the industry is. in sore straitsi  --  mainly from temporary and artificial causes ? is especially ungracious . The bill only obtained the fate it deserved . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the law attempting to ' unite the money values of gold and silver at a false ratio . " The Indian Currency Commission did not fix any ratio between gold . and silver . It attempted to " chain " the rupee to gold instead of to the . pound sterling , whose value varied from day to day , the rupee being a token coin , India . being under the gold exchange standard since 1593 . SRINIVAS R. WAGEL . New York , Feb. 25 ; 1921 . English Friends of Ireland . To the Editor of The New York Times : Thousands of Erin 's best friends are Englishmen who are really displeased , if not disgusted : with the attitude of their Government toward Ireland . Among the Englishmen who want , justice for Ireland none is more sympathetic than Sir Philip Gibbs . If any Irishman in this country or any Irish-American , or even a professional heckler , doubts the sincerity of Sir Philip 's sympathy , he need but turn to the files of The National Weekly of London and read " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant war correspondent . HENRY GARRITY . ' New York , Feb. 25 , 1921 . Lost Irish Sympathy .. To the Editor of The ew York Times : Matters certainly have ' come to a very bad pass when . a citizen of a friendly country can not speak in New York City without being howled down . What sympathy I have had for the aspirations of the Irish I have lost after reading of the receptions that Sir Philip Gibbs , Major Putnam and others have received from Sinn Feiners . If such " fairmlndedness " is the Sinn Fein idea of democracy , give me British " autocracy . " ARTHUR DE HAVEN . New York , Feb. 26 , 1021.
