YES , many stories portray animal life as a tragedy , to be sure , and scientific books commonly speak of it asa struggle for existence ; but forget all such notions here in the budding woods , where the tragedy ' appears as a romantic invention and the ' struggle ' as a bookish theory . To quote Darwin as an authority is to deceive yourself , since Darwin borrowed the whole notion of struggle from the economist Malthus , who invented it not as a theory of nature ( of which he knew nothing ) , but to explain from his easy-chair the vice and misery of massed humanity . Open your eyes and see , or ask now the beasts and they will tell you , that natural life is from beginning to end a gladsome comedy . " Nature herself seems to whisper the lesson as I look out from my commoosie at the sunrise on Moosehead , the sunrise of a spring morning . A loon blows his wild bugle from the lake below . A multitude of little warblers , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exultation , singing as they go . Frogs are piping , kingfishers clattering , thrushes chiming their silver bells ? everywhere is the full tide of life , the impulse of play , the spirit of happy adventure . Above these voices of rejoicing sounds another note , a jubilant hammering , in which there is no hint of struggle or tragedy ; rather , does it seem to announce that comedy , light of foot and heart , has again renewed her lease of the wilderness and is everywhere throwing out her living posters . On the top of a towering hemlock a log-cock has his sounding-board , dry and resonant , and is making all the hills echo to his lusty drumming . The morning light gleams on his ebony bill or flames on his scarlet crest as he turns his head alertly , this way for the answer of a mate , that way for the challenge of a rival . Nearer , on the roof of my fishing-camp , a downy woodpecker is thumping the metal cover of the stovepipe , a wonderful drum , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log-cock . Daily before sunrise that same little fellow appears on my roof , so punctually that one wonders if he keeps a clock , and bids me " Top o ' the morning " by sending a triphammer din clattering down the stovepipe . It is a love-call to his mate , no doubt ; but the Seven Sleepers in my place must be roused by it as by dynamite . This morning he exploded me out of sleep at four-twenty , as usual , and so persistent was his racketypackety that I lost patience and threw a stick of wood at him . Away he went , crying " Yip , yip ! " at the meddlesome Philistine who had no heart for love , no ear for music . He was heading briskly for the horizon when , remembering his mate , he darted aside to the shell of a white pine , where he drummed out another message , only to meet violent opposition from another Philistine . IIe had sounded one call , listened for the effect , and was in the midst of a vibrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking of boughs , and Meeko , the red squirrel appeared , threatening , death and destruction to all drummers . Evidently Meeko was projecting a nest of his own in that vicinity , and had no mind to tolerate such a noisy fellow as a neighbor . As he came headlong upon the scene , hurling abuse ahead of him , the woodpecker vanished like a wink , leaving the enemy to threaten the empty air ; which he did in a fashion to make one shudder at what might happen if a red squirrel were half as big as his temper . Once I saw a bull moose accidentally shake a branch on which Meeko happened to be sitting while he was eating a mushroom , turning it around in his paws as he nibbled the edges ; and the peppery little beast followed the sober great beast two or three hundred yards , running just above the antlered head , calling down the wrath of squirrel heaven on all the tribe of moose . Now , in a greater rage because the object of it was so small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , kilch-kilch ! to be his property and warning all woodpeckers , zit-zit ! to keep forever away from it . He had hardly ended his demonstration of squirrel rights and gone away , swearing , to his interrupted affairs when another hammering , louder and more jubilant , began on the same pine shell . Here was defiance as well as trespass , and Meeko came rushing back to deal with it properly . Sputtering like a lighted fuse , he darted up the pine and took a flying leap after the drummer , determined this time to make an end of him or chase him clean out of the woods . Into a thicket of spruce he went , shrilling his battle yell . Out of the thicket flashed the woodpecker , unseen , and doubled back to the starting-point . And there a curious thing happened , one which strengthened my impression that all birds have more or less ventriloquial power to make their calling sound near or far at will . The woodpecker lit on precisely the same spot which he had used before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now his drum sounded faintly , distantly , as if on the other side of the ridge . Growing bolder , he changed his note , put more hallelujah into it , and was in the midst of a glorious rub-a-dub when Meeko came tearing back through the spruce thicket and hunted him away . So the little comedy ran on , charge and retreat , till a second Meeko appeared and held the fort , while the first ran after the drummer . Now , as I watch the play , there is triumphant squirrel talk on the pine shell , and the woodpecker is again drumming lustily on the stovepipe cover . To follow these or any other creatures of the wild , keeping your eyes and your heart open , is to learn for yourself the immense , the unchanging cheerfulness of nature ; it is also to enter with the sympathy of understanding into the spirit of that play which runs day and night in the big woods . Around your summer camp , for example , the red squirrels are the most numerous and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you ever attempt to interpret the astonishing variety of sounds which squirrels use to voice their little comedy ? When angry they scold ; when surprised they snicker ; at other times they fling jest or abuse or repartee at one another , their voices changing noticeably with their changing moods . Now and then , as you follow Meeko about , he utters a long , vibrant , and exultant call in sheer delight at being alive , you think ; or he stops short in a gambol and puzzles you by sitting very still , very attentive , his nose pressed against the branch between his paws . Gone suddenly are all his jeers , his exultations , his mischief-making ; he has a sober , introspective air , as if trying to remember something , or as if listening to what his other self might be saying . If you study Meeko 's eye at such a moment , noting its telltale lights , you will have a different opinion of his silence . He is listening , indeed , but to something so fine or distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather what it says . Therefore does he use the branch as a sounding-board , pressing his nose or teeth against it to catch the faint vibrations in a way to help his ears , just as woodpeckers use their tongues for the same purpose . There ! you hear the sound faintly now , and Meeko hears it distinctly enough to understand it , if one may judge by his actions . It comes from another squirrel out yonder , a truculent fellow who is proclaiming his heretical opinion to the universe , and to this little dogmatist in particular . Watch Meeko now ; see his silent abso-rption change to violent rage . He barks ; he seems to curse in his own way ; he springs up and down on the same spot , like a Quebec lumberman who jumps on his hat to work himself up to the fighting pitch . Out of breath , he stops a moment to listen , to ascertain whether he has silenced his opponent . A jeer floats in from the distance . Mceko says , " KiIch-kilch ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and away he goes headlong . To follow him is to witness a characteristic squirrel argument ? a challenge , a rush , an upset , a furious chase up and down , over and under the swaying branches , till your head grows dizzy in following it . And then one long , triumphant yell to proclaim that another heresy is silenced forever . Very different from the irate Meeko is his cousin Chick'weesep , the friendly little chipmunk , who comes to eat from your hand or to explore your pocket , if you take a few quiet hours to tame or reassure him . Even at first acquaintance he commonly shows that he is intensely curious about you ; and this is the way of it : From a distance your eye happens to catch him sitting motionless on his favorite stump , where his coat blends perfectly with the sunshine and the wonderful forest colors . Heading in his direction , you aim to pass close by , but not too close , as if you were seeking something far ahead . Chick'weesep watches you keenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so excited , that he can not keep still . His eyes sparkle ; his feet dance ; his whole body quivers as he wavers between the lifelong habit of concealment and his evident desire to be noticed by this big passing animal who is surely a stranger in the woods , since his eye is dull andhis foot noisy . On you come steadily , paying no heed to the tiny atom of life that watches you , like a child at a window who hopes to be saluted , and Chick'weesep follows your every step with questioning eyes till you have passed him and are plainly going away . Up to this moment he has been a little afraid that you might see him ; now , fearful that you will not see , he blows a loud whistle to tell you that he is there . A hundred times I have had a heartwarming over that little comedy , which always follows the same course . There is the first start of surprise when the little fellow sees you , the eager look , the quivering feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pass with apparent indifference . And when you turn quickly , as if surprised , Chick'weesep dodges out of sight with a different cry , a cry with mingled pleasure and alarm in it ; but the next moment he is peeking at you with dancing eyes from a rrevice . Then , if you bide quietly where you are , he may come nearer , talking as he comes ; and within a short time , should you have food that he likes , he will be sitting with entire confidence on your knee , stuffing all you offer into his cheeks till they bulge as if he had the mumps , or pulling with all his might at a choice morsel which you hold tightly to tease him . A red squirrel would nip you if you teased him like that ; but Chick'weesep braces himself with soft paws against the tips of your fingers and tugs till he gets his titbit . This in the deep wilderness , where he has not been made to know the fear of man , and where he is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the squirrel . While watching a chipmunk one summer , a fascinating little fellow who often came to beg with eloquent eyes for nuts or rice or sweet chocolate , I learned first the location of his den , and then , when he abandoned it for a more roomy storehouse , the whole secret of his building . For years our naturalists have soberly debated the mystery of the chipmunk 's den , how he can construct a tunnel without leaving any fresh earth to betray him ; but when I was a boy almost any farmer 's lad in the whole countryside could have given instant explanation . " How does the chipmunk dig a hole without leaving any earth at the entrance ? Why , very simply ; he begins at the other end . " And though the answer is true , beyond cavil or gainsaying , some doubting Thomas must make a deeper mystery of the chipmunk 's craft by demanding , But how does he get to the other end ? " That also is simple ; but you will not appreciate the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He trusts nature for that , and contents himself with furnishing the tunnel and the doorway . In some way ( probably by sounding or tapping the earth ) Chick'weesep learns that there is a den under a certain tree or rock , a natural hollow engineered by frost or rain or settling earth . During the summer he locates two or three such places , and explores them till he finds one which offers him a dry nest for sleeping , a colder room near the frost-line for provisions , and a little free space for winter life and exercise . Starting at a distance of several feet , he first runs a slanting shaft down to see what the den may offer . This working shaft is as straight as he can make it , and the earth from his digging is thrown out mostly in a loose pile at the entrance . When he reaches the den below , and finds it satisfactory , lie starts another tunnel upward , a long and devious tunnel which follows beside roots where the digging is easy , or where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this second tunnel is thrown back into the den , and from there is pushed upward into his working shaft , which is thus filled solidly from end to end . The finished den has , therefore , but one opening , and there is no sign of earth about the doorway , for the simple reason that the whole tunnel was excavated from below . To fashion such a den and fill its storeroom full to overflowing in the beautiful autumn days must be a joyous experience , I fancy , even to an unthinking squirrel . On the farm the happiest days of the whole year are not those of the spring planting ( for sowing of seeds is an artificial work , the result of our thought and calculation ) , but rather in the rewardful autumn , when man 's primitive instincts are deeply stirred as he gathers the fruits of the earth into his winter storehouse . Likewise in the wilderness , the happiest days which ever conic to a man are those in which he builds a shack by the labor of his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , with eager anticipation of snappy days afield or stormy nights before the fire , looks upon his finished work and says in his heart , " Now welcome , winter . " If spoiled man can feel this simple , instinctive joy of providing for creature comforts , why not an unspoiled squirrel also ? In the woods all natural creatures , man included , seem to be made of the same happy , elemental stuff . As with the little , so also with the larger woodfolk , even those whom we ignorantly call savage ; when you meet without frightening them in their native woods , they all seem to be playing at comedy for the greater part of their days . I suppose there are no animals that have given rise to more fearsome stories than have the wolves and bears , the one the symbol of ravin , the other of ferocity ; but when you meet the real wolf he turns out to be a very shy beast , one that has a curious , doglike interest in man , but is afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far from being the terrible creature of literary imagination , is in reality a harmless kind of vagabond whose waking life is one long succession of whims and drolleries . The trouble is , on first meeting a bear , that one is so frightened by the innocent beast , or so eager to kill , that one never opens his eyes frankly to see what kind of fellow-blunderer is before him . Several times , when I have had the luck to find bears among the blueberries of the burnt lands , I have crept near to watch them ; and their greed , their endless interest in something to eat , their comical ways of stripping a berry-bush or robbing an ants ' nest , their watchfulness lest one of their number discover something good and eat it all by himself , their surprises and alarms , their sudden , pig-like fits of excitement , their whimsical and everchanging expression ? all this is so unexpected , so entertaining , that a few minutes of it will be enough to change your whole opinion of the bear 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast ; you leave him , or he leaves you , with the notion that he is the best of all natural comedians . Here , for example , is a simple but illuminating show of bear nature , one of a score which you will uncover with surprise as you follow Mooween 's trail . When a cub finds a toothsome morsel he sweeps it into his mouth on the instant , if it be small enough to swallow quickly ; but if it offers several mouthfuls , the first thing he does is to look alertly about to see where the other cubs are . If they are near or watching him , he promptly sits on his morsel and pretends to be surveying the world ; but if they are busy with their own affairs , he carefully comes between them and his find , turning his back on them while he eats . One might think this little deception a mere accident until it is repeated , or until this supplemental bit of bear psychology bubbles up to the surface . When a cub sees another cub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he first stares hard , his face an exclamation-point , as if he could not believe his eyes . Then he cries , " Ur-rump-umph ! " and comes on the jump to have a share of whatever the fortunate one has uncovered . Knowing what it means when he turns his own back , I suppose , lie jumps to the conclusion that he is just like all other greedy cubs , or that all other cubs are just like him . To a spectator the most amusing part of the comedy is that when a cub is discovered in his greediness he seems to treat it as a joke , gobbling as much as possible of his find , but showing no ill temper if another cub arrives in time to have a bit of it . " Get away with it if you can , but do n't squeal if you are caught , " seems to be the sporting rule of a young bear family . As they grow older they become unsociable , even morose , and occasionally one meets a bear that seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a family of black bears , my position on a high rock preventing them from getting my scent , I saw one of the cubs unearth a morsel and gobble it greedily . It was a bees ' nest , I think , and it was certainly delicious ; the little fellow ate it with gusto , making a loud smacking as he opened or closed his mouth and afterward licking his chops again and again , as if he could never have enough of the taste . Twenty yards away another cub suddenly threw up his head , smelling the sweets , undoubtedly , for they can wind a disturbed bees ' nest at an incredible distance . Rolling his fur in anticipation , the hungry little fellow scampered up and nosed all over the spot , sniffing and whining . Finding nothing but a smell , he sat down , crossed both paws over the top of his head , and howled a wild falsetto , " O000-wow-ow-ow-ow ! " twisting about and shaking his whole body like a petulant child . Meanwhile the other little cub looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side ; every now and then he would run out a slender red tongue and lap it around his lips as if to say , " Yum-ymn , it was good . " When their stomachs are filled the cubs take to playing ; and one who watches them at their play has no more heart to kill them . They are too droll , and the big woods seem to need them . They hide , and the mother , after vain calling , must go smell them out ; but as the end of that game is commonly a cuffing , it is not repeated . Then , mindful of their ears , the cubs begin to wrestle ; or they face each other and box , striking and fending till one gets more than he , wants , when they clinch and go rolling about in a rough-and-tumble . But the most fascinating sight is when two cubs climb a tree on opposite sides , a tree so big that they are hidden one from the other . The one in your sight goes humping aloft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward by powerful digs of his hind claws , till he thinks lie is well above his rival . In the excitement , what with eying chips and the loud scratching of bark , he hears nothing but the sound of his own going . Then he peeks cautiously around the tree , and very likely finds a black nose coming to meet him . He hits it quickly and dodges away to the other side , only to get his ? own nose rapped . So they play hide and peek , and hit and dodge and peek again , till they scramble into the high branches . And there they whimper awhile , afraid to come down . Not till they are sharply called will they try the descent , sagging down backward , looking first over one shoulder , then over the other . But if they are in a hurry and the branches are not too high , they simply turn all loose , like a coon ; they tumble down in a heap , hit the ground and bound away unhurt , like rubber balls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd mixture of fondness and discipline , with temper enough to give variety to both . Sometimes she mothers the cubs with a gruff , bearish kind of tenderness . When they bother her by hiding , or when they are heedless of some warning or message , she cuffs them impatiently ; and a bear 's cuff is no love-pat , but a thud from a heavy paw which sends a cub spinning end over end . If you are near enough to read her expression , you will hear her at one moment say : " That 's my little cubs ! Oh , that 's my little cubs ! " A few minutes later she will be sitting with humped back , her great head on one side , her paws between her outstretched hind legs , and in her piggy , disapproving eye the question , " Can these greedy little unfillable things be my offspring ? " So they move across the berry-field , a day-long comedy . What they do at night nobody has ever seen . The fox is another comedian whose cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but whose amusing side has not yet found a worthy chronicler . Young foxes play by the hour , with an endless variety of games , mock fights and rough-and-tumble capers which make the antics of a kitten almost dull by comparison . That they are glad little beasts , without fear and with only a saving measure of caution , is plain enough to any one who has ever watched them with the understanding of sympathy . Moreover , unlike the bears , they keep the spirit of play to the end ; a grown fox will chase his tail in sheer exuberance of animal spirits , or will forget his mousing or even his hunger in the pleasure of pestering a tortoise when he finds one of the awkward creatures loafing about the woods . One summer day I watched a fox-andwoodchuck drama in which keen wits were pitted against dull wits , a drama to which only the genius of Uncle Remus could do justice . It was late afternoon , and the chuck had ventured away from his den to a clover-field for a last sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox came out of the woods , leaped to the top of a stone wall , and looked keenly over the clover . I think Eleemos knew that this particular field had a promising den , and that he was planning to catch one of the young woodchucks . Hence his lofty station on'the wail , with bushes bending over to shadow him , and the expectant look in his bright yellow eyes . He gave a quick start as he caught a. waving of grass , the cautious motion of a grizzled head ; then he dropped back into the woods , ran down behind the wall , slipped over it under cover of a bush , crept fiat on his belly to a rock , and peeked around it to measure his chance . Oh yes , he could catch that slow fellow yonder , surely , without half trying ! Inch by inch he pushed clear of the rock , waited with his feet under him till the chuck dropped out of sight to feed , and then launched himself like a bolt . Now a woodchuck is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , to be caught napping in the open . Like the beaver , he often sits up for a wary look on all sides ; after which he drops as if to feed , but immediately bobs up a second time . A young chuck may be foolishly content with a single survey ; but a veteran is apt to make at least two false starts at feeding , with the evident purpose of fooling any one who may be watching . So it befell that , just as the fox leaped from cover , the woodchuck 's head bobbed up from the clover . He saw the enemy instantly and scuttled away for his den , his fat body shaking like a jelly-bag as he ran . After him came the fox with swift jumps ; into the hole dived the woodchuck , sending back a whistle of defiance ; and the fox , grabbing at the vanishing tail , fetched up bump ! against the earth with a shock that might have dislocated a less limber neck . He had the tail , however , firmly gripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to drag his game out bodily ? a hard job , as any one knows who has ever tested a woodchuck 's holding power . Eleemos pulled steadily at first ; but he might as well have tried to pull up a young hickory as to move that anchored creature with hind feet braced against opposite sides of the hole and paws gripped about a roCk . or a root . Then the fox began to tug , bracing his forefeet and jerking his whole body to the rear , like a terrier on a rope . In the midst of a mighty effort something gave way ; the fox went over backward , turning end over end down the pitch of the hill . He picked himself up in a shamefaced sort of way , sniffed a moment at the empty hole , and trotted off to the woods with a small piece of scrubby tail in his mouth . Such little comedies arc not uncommon ; they go on at all hours , in all unspoiled places , the only uncommon thing being that now and then some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The few squirrels , bears , woodpeckers and other creatures which I have here pictured are typical of all natural birds and beasts ; gladness and comedy prevail among them until some sportsman appears with his needless killing , or a scientist invents an absurd theory of natural struggle to account for unnatural human depravity , or a literary artist with imaginative eye creates a world-embracing tragedy out of a passing incident . The accepted fashion now is to put yourself in the skin of a fox running before the dogs , or of a buck that springs up alert at the hunting howl of a wolf-pack , and from your own fears , your vivid imagination , your weak legs or weak heart , and your ignorance of animal psychology , to fill the quiet woods with advancing terror and tragedy . Now I have followed many fox-hunts in the New England woods , and have yet to meet the first fox that does not appear to be getting more fun out of the chase than comes to the heavy-footed hounds as their particular portion . Except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes him take to earth , a fox runs lightly , almost leisurely , stopping often to listen , and even snatching a nap when his speed or his crisscrossed trail has put a safe distance between him and the hounds . He has a dozen fastnesses among the ledges , where he can find safety at any time ; but the simple fact is that a red fox prefers to keep his feet in the open , knowing that he can outrun or outwit any pack of dogs if he be given a fair field . Also , I once witnessed the death of a buck at the fangs of a wolf , and it was utterly different from what I had imagined . The buck ran down a ridge through deep snow and out on a frozen take , where he might easily have escaped Aad he put his mind into the running , since his sharp hoofs clung securely to the ice where the wolf 's paws slithered wildly , losing grip and balance at every jump . Instead of running for his life , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or curious to know what the chase was all about . The wolf kept easily close at heel , stopping when the buck stopped , until he saw his chance , when he flashed in , threw his game , and paralyzed it by a single powerful snap over the kidneys . Before that buck found out what was up he was dead or beyond all feeling . The wolf raised his head in a tingling cry that rang over the frozen waste like an invitation , and out of the dark woods beyond the lake raced a wolf-pack to share in the feast . That might appear as a tragic or terrible ending , I suppose , if you viewed it imaginatively from the side of Hetokh , the buck ; but how would it appear if you looked at it imaginatively from the viewpoint of MaIsuni , the wolf , a hungry wolf , who must take whatever good thing his mother Nature offers to satisfy his hunger ? And if you elect to stand by the buck , as the better animal , it is still unreasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ignoring all the happy days that went before . He had lived five or six years , as I judged from his development , and he died in a minute . Moreover , this also is to be remembered , that the idea of death and the fear of death are wholly the result of imagination . And of imagination ? that marvelous creative faculty which enables us vividly to picture the unseen or to follow the unknown , and which is the highest attribute of the human mind ? the buck had probably very little ; certainly not enough either to inspire or to trouble him . Life was all that he knew when the end came quickly . He had absolutely no conception of death , and therefore no fear of it . Any such thing as tragedy was to him unthinkable . The point is , you see , that in our modern view of nature , a view which we curiously imagine to he scientific when it is merely bookish and thoughtless , we are prone to let the moment or the passing incident of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , its changing seasons , its work and play and rest . To go out-of-doors and look upon nature with unprejudiced eyes is to learn that death is but a curtain letdown on a play . Of the stage to which the play is removed , as of that other stage whence it came here , we have as yet no knowledge ; but this much we see plainly , that for its completion every life , however small or great , must have its exit as well as its entrance . The quality of that life is to be judged not by either of its momentary and mysterious extremes , but by the long , pleasure-seeking , pleasure-finding days which lie between its end and its beginning .
