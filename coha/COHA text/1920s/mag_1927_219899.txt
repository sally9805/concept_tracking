At the invitation of an Assistant U. S. Attorney , one Kenneth Simpson , there arrived in Manhattan from Paris last week Alexander Feodorvich Kerensky , to stop with Mr. and Mrs. Simpson at their Park Avenue residence . New York newspapers welcomed M. Kerensky in editorials of praise , of friendship . The Herald Tribune , usually synchronous with the Administration , stated that " Kerensky will have the help and support of all good Americans , " Overnight this wiry , medium-sized man , with slightly bowed legs , a cropped head , and habitually narrow , squinting eyes , seemed to have become almost a national hero to the press . <P> Peroration . Through an interpreter M. Kerensky , who speaks no English , said : " I do not think the agents of Soviet Russia are fomenting trouble in Mexico or elsewhere in foreign countries . They lack the power to do so . ... I , myself , never think of a return to power . My episode is over . But I am continuing and will continue until the last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must settle their own internal affairs . . . . " <P> Comet . This was the man and these were the words which came as unheralded as though a comet had struck Manhattan and dissipated far and wide its gaseous tail . Where does the four-month Kerensky regime fit into the ' ten years elapsed since Nicholas II signed his abdication on March 15 , 1917 ? Significant years : <P> 1881 . At Simbirsk the wife of a school principal gave birth to Alexander Feodorovich Kerensky , a pale , sickly , bright-eyed child . <P> 1912 . After graduating from the University of St. Petersburg and becoming a lawyer famed for his moving and impassioned defense of numerous Socialists , M. Kerensky was elected to the Fourth Duma as a Social Democrat . He belonged to the " Lesser Group " or " Mensheviki " of his party , in contradistinction of the " Larger Group " or " Bolsheviki. " + <P> 1917 . Menshevik Kerensky was present in Petrograd** when there began a curiously leaderless and random series of riots and disorders among the people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaderless disorders reached such a pitch that the Duma found the Tsarist authority had vanished and set up a Temporary Governing Committee which two days later became the Cabinet of Prince Lvov in which M. Kerensky was Minister of Justice . Next day representatives of the Duma obtained the abdication of the Tsar . Russians were all but stupefied that the Tsarist regime was so rotten at the core as to topple after four days of disorder in Petrograd . Troops ordered to shoot down the mobs flung away their guns and embraced the rioters . Never was a revolution less bloody . <P> Soon M. Kerensky became War Minister , and in May he began an extraordinary oratorical campaign which so far restored the morale of the army that it launched a last desperate offensive against Germany in June . When this failed and the army collapsed the power of the Mensheviki became shadowy ; but Minister Kerensky as the outstanding Menshevik leader assumed the Premiership which he held for four months .                  @ @ @
