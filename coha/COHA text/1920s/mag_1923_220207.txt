The Leviathan , formerly the German Vaterland , now owned by the U. S. Shipping Board , will leave her drydock at Newport News about May 1 to resume her place as the second largest ship in the world . She will ply the Atlantic passenger trade as a rival to the Majestic , the largest vessel , and the Mauretania , the fleetest . Nearly 3,000 workmen were employed in her refitting-an $8,500,000 job .
