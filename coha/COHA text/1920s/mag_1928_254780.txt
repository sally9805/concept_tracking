DUE RECKONING-Stephen McKenna - Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . This is the last volume in the series of three called The Realists . The central figures in the series are again three : Ambrose Sheridan , titan and punching politician , who marries Auriol Otway who loves Max Hendry . In Due Reckoning , the Gordian knot of this situation is not sliced but neatly untied by Author McKenna . That he had the untying in mind when he first pulled the strings tight is sufficiently obvious ; and Auriol 's prayers for the one chance in a hundred that will release her from a marriage that was never more than a duty gladly borne are quite apparently going to be answered by Author McKenna who is their instigator . <P> Britishers delight in reading about such supermen as Ambrose Sheridan ; supermen who rise to journalistic and then political eminence , who marry beautiful and frail aristocrats , who carry a bee in their derby bonnets about resuscitating the human race or the working classes of England . Author McKenna writes about his superman less pompously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Galsworthy , less romantically than did Michael Arlen , more rapidly than did W. L. George . Youthful and prolific , Author McKenna knows his subject at first hand ; through the War and until two years after Sonia , in 1917 , brought him bows and plaudits , he served the British government in diplomatic or other capacities .
