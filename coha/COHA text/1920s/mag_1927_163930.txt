President von Hindenburg sought to end the Cabinet crisis ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) by calling upon Minister of Economics , Herr Doktor Julius Curtius to form a Cabinet . Herr Doktor Curtius , who could pass in most assemblages for a smooth-shaven U. S. businessman , dickered earnestly all week with his political peers but was unable to get sufficient support to keep even a " Little Coalition Cabinet " afloat . Subsequently the President called upon Herr Wilhelm Marx , whose Cabinet has resigned but functions ad interim , to try to form a Government .
