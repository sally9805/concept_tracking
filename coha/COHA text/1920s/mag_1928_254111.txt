Clarence Dillon and Walter Percy Chrysler were eating lunch at a Manhattan club , some four miles from Wall Street , May made fair weather outdoors . Mr. Dillon had just returned from one of his frequent idlings in Europe ( this was three weeks ago ) and looked almost robust . <P> Physically he is frail , and , when working hard , fidgety . The condition is largely the result of an accident a score of years ago . He was on a week-end visit at the country home near Milwaukee of Ann McEldin Douglass , his fiancee. * Mrs. Douglass with the young people was at the railroad station . Along the tracks went an express train , and across the tracks a huge St. Bernard dog . The train batted the huge dog through the air . The dog struck Mr. Dillon in the stomach and knocked him toward a lamp post . On the way he struck Mrs. Douglass and broke her arm . At the post he struck his head . There was a concussion of the brain , fear of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became well he and Miss Douglass were married , and went to Europe for two years ( $8,000 railroad damages paid expenses ) . Although he spends one to three months each year in the woods with his son , hunting and fishing and strolling , he has never recovered the vibrant strength of his childhood in Texas , of his youth in Massachusetts ( Worcester Academy , Harvard ' 05 ) . He still has a bump on his head from that accident . <P> Walter Percy Chrysler , sitting opposite Mr. Dillon at that mid-Manhattan luncheon , seemed a mighty smith . But when he spoke , his words were as precise , his phrases as concise as Mr. Dillon 's suaver ones . <P> They talked about motor cars . Mr. Chrysler spoke of his four models-the four cylinder Chrysler " 52 " selling at $670 f. o. b . Detroit , and of his three sixes , the " 62 " in the $1,000 class , the " 72 " at $1.545 &; up , the Imperial " 80 " at $3,000 and up . He mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soto , " to be made by a separate corporation ; and to be sold for $900 .

He , motor maker , asked questions of Clarence Dillon , investment banker , about Dodge Bros , factories , dealers and finances . Mr. Dillon asked about Chrysler Corp . ' s factories , dealers and finances . <P> Postprandially the two men decided that Dodge Bros , and Chrysler Corp . might in some fashion consolidate to the benefit of their stockholders , employes , dealers , customers . <P> There followed action of amazing and utterly unprecedented speed . Engineers and accountants for both met the very next week in a Detroit hotel . Before each other they placed statistics and reports on every detail of their respective operations . Great businessmen trust each other in such fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened to Manhattan with analyzed data . Mr. Dillon , solitary in the great silence of his soundproof office downtown , studied them . Mr. Chrysler , less sensitive to racket , studied them at his office in midtown Madison Avenue . When he went to his Park Avenue home four blocks away he was preoccupied , and servants avoided disturbing him .
