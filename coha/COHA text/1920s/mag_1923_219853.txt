Shelby , Mont. , is to take its place beside Goldfield , Nev. , as the scene of a great conflict . Jack Dempsey , heavyweight champion , has signed articles to fight 15 rounds to decision with Tom Gibbons of St. Paul in Shelby on the afternoon of July 4 . Shelby is populated by slightly less than 1,000 persons and is seldom dignified by mention on the map . Montana promotors have guaranteed the champion $300,000 , nearly $700 a minute , for his part in the ceremonies . Gibbons will take a gambler 's chance with a percentage of the gate receipts . <P> Expert critics agree that Gibbons , who is little more than a middleweight , will have " no chance . " Others , equally expert , insist that the whole announcement is merely a bit of ballyhoo and that Tex Rickard will step in at the critical moment and transfer the fight to Boyle 's Thirty Acres . <P> Meanwhile Dempsey and Gibbons have started training .               @ @ @ @ @ @
