Whether or not it is ever built to dam water , the proposed 675-ft . Federal power and irrigation dam in the Boulder Canyon of the Colorado River has already backed up an enormous supply of attention , irrigated the U. S. with rushing streams of propaganda and oratory , generated powerful currents of controversy . The purposes for which the actual dam is proposed are : <P> 1 ) To provide a water supply for Arizona and Utah farmers and for California suburbanites ( Los Angeles ) . <P> 2 ) To furnish electricity to the seven Colorado Basin States ( Arizona , California , Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico , Utah , Wyoming ) . <P> 3 ) To protect from floods the inhabitants of California 's Imperial Valley , which is below the Colorado 's bed-level . <P> The causes of Boulder Dam controversy are : <P> 1 ) The difference in the cultures of Arizona and California-rancher v. realtor . <P> 2 ) The facts , that only 2% of the Colorado basin lies in California ; that practically no California water drains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Arizona , whose streams furnish 28% of the river 's flow at Boulder Canyon . Reflecting these facts in the provisions of the bill in such a manner as to satisfy Arizona has to date proved impossible . <P> 3 ) The activities of the U. S. public utilities-the " Power Trust " - private interests opposing the Government 's entry to the electricity industry . So widespread , so penetrating , so energetic , so determined , so covert has been the propaganda of these interests that , as it is exposed bit by bit by the Federal Trade Commission 's current investigation , the issue between California and Arizona has been twisted from its cultural base . <P> 4 ) All seven States in the Colorado Basin agree that it would be advantageous to obtain Federal development and control of their common natural resource . But California , a boom state , presses for immediate action . And Arizona , slow-growing , temporizes to protect its future . <P> The House let the Senators fight it out , this session , and a long fight it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Utah 's Smoot aided Arizona 's Ashurst and Hayden , first indirectly , then directly , in delaying the debate . Maryland 's Bruce and Tydings and Tennessee 's McKellar helped the Arizonans too . But it was the orotund Ashurst and the dogged Hayden who , with desks stacked high with time-consuming documents , talked and talked and talked the bill to a standstill last week . <P> In one of his more magnificent sentences , Senator Ashurst enunciated the whole spirit of a filibusterer , as follows : " Although of superb physical strength , you can take the heart even out of an elephant , the stomach out of an ostrich , and you may finally pierce the hide of a rhinoceros if you keep at him so great a time as the long and weary months that I have been practically on the gridiron , trying to prevent the great injustice this bill would perpetrate upon Arizona ! " <P> Senator Johnson 's solace in defeat was consent of the Senate to consider the dam again first thing next autumn . A resolution by Senator Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and report on Boulder Dam once more this summer , was also passed . This report will doubtless be decisive .
