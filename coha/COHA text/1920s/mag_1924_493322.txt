What Is An Elephant ? ? A Fable for Critics POLITICS , I have learned from literature , is not the only manufacturer of strange bedfellows . He was hardly a politician who called for a lion to lie with a lamb , and ladies have lain down with lap dogs long before Barnum . Not the strangest of bedfe/lowships , either , is that of the players of the critical game with certain blind men and of the game itself with an elephant , more or less white . This beast is celebrated in fable because of a high disputation the blind men once held on the theme , " What is an Elephant ? " each deriving his arguments from an accidental pawing of a pachyderrnan part . The disputation has gone down in legend as a light o ' logic , but there has been , as usual , no profit in example , also in so significant an example as this . Experience , it would seem , even when it brings disillusion , never quite kills hope , and with regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always both disillusioned and hopeful . What criticism is in America , ' how it stands and what it does are inystifications I have more than once sought enlightenment upon , from the works and wisdom of the great arbitr ? elegantiae and censores morum of the land ? from Mr. Irving Babbitt , and Mr. H. L. Mencken , from Mr. Stuart Sherman and Mr. J. E. Spingarn , from Mr. Van Wyck Brooks and Mr. T. S. Eliot . When I saw that their several wisdoms , and those of two or three others , had been collected in a book ? , and that the book offered a revelation of the function and status of criticism in the United States , I said to myself " Aha I At lastl Here at last I shall rest from my searchings , here at last is resoluLion for the perplexities of my mind .

" Criticism 's creative , " apodicat ? Mr. Spingarn . " It 's an art . It 's expression . All art is expression . Do n't express Willie . Express yourself about Willie , and you 're a critic . " " I am , " retorts Mr. Babbitt , " but you 're not . Expression my all-standardizing eye ! That joke had whiskers before your grandfather 's grandfather was born . Worse than mid-Victorian . Eighteenth Century . Bahl Criticism is conscience . Criticism is standards . Criticism owns ' the ethical and generalizing imagination . ' " " Bunk ! " cuts in Mr. Mencken . " Booboisie ideology ! You and your schools and your standards . How do you get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to think that a critic ought to know something besides himself . But I 've changed my mind . I hold with Spingarn . A critic does n't even have to know himself . He should be something of a superman . Criticism is certainly an art and the critic certainly must express himself . What else has he to express , anyhow ? " " What defilement ! How unAmericen I " exclaims Professor Sherman . " The critic must know the difference between good and evil . He most be a voi ? of the national genius . He most share the moral idealism of American society . He must help it make the ten commandments work and Puritanism beautiful . " " Never ? " breaks out Mr. Brooks indignantly . " The ten commandments work art out of existence . Puritanism has been an ugly escape from the realities of American life , not their substance . It has rendered literature ' mere ' , and made of art an amusement or a soporific . We do n't How what America is , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an experiment , the great American experimes.ment . America is an object of faith . The job for criticism is to discover the faith . " " Now I 've another idea , " Mr. Spingarn says , taking the last word . " To express himself a critic has to be a philosopher . He has to be well-informed and he has to have a deep sensibility . " Mr. Woodberry opines that historical criticism is an essential preliminary to expression , or aasthetic criticism , in which you become one with the soul of the artist . Mr. Brownell thinks that a criticism should convey a correct judgment as well as a portrait of a work of art , while Mr. Eliot wants the critic to be very intelligent , to refrain from making judgments of worse and better , and simply to inquire and elucidate . Doing this , he thinks , requires both sensibility and intellect . He calls criticism a development of sensibility , a critic 's statement in language of the structure of his perceptions . And , yes ? Mr. Boyd denounces Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature to be Nordic , Protestant and blond . Then there is an appendix of " passages illustrating the growth of an American tradition of criticism . " Al ? the gentlemen cited in about ten pages ? Jefferson , Emerson , Poe , Thoreau , Margaret Fuller , Lowell , Moffat , Walt Whitman , Bascom , Timrod , Parkman , Burroughs , Henry James , Howells , Henry Adams , Queenslet , P. E. More , T. Roosevelt , J. Huneker , John Macy , Amy Lowell , James B. Cabell ? seem to sustain the doctrine of Mr. Spingarn ; but from what I blow of them I feel sure that Mr. Sher- m can find citations from most if not all that will sustain thean doctrine of Mr. Sherman . That , however , is another story . It is the case in hand that is bothersome . You can see why my head was in a whirl , reading the stuff . These master-critics go off like members of Congress before election , contradicting them- se/ves and one another . Each , as you read him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinces . But their arguments spin you round like a tectotum . At first you tell yourself that they ca n't be all Congressmen or all right . Then you ask yourself " Why ca n't they ? " Then you recall how insistent each is on his own unique and exclusive rightness and the complete wrongness of the others . And each is a great man . Very reputable . Very respectable . With large respectable and reputable congregations of cornmuni- cants that hang upon his words .. It 's when your headache becomes almost unbearable that you remember the fable of the Blind Men and the Ele- phant . The fable of the Blind Men and the Elephant teaches how a whole , even a whole Elephant , may sometimes be quite other than any of its parts . That this teaching should apply also to criticism and to critics of criticism , need , the world being aggregated as it is , cause no shock even to the most pious communicant of any critic 's confession . Criticism is first and 1. t a name for certain ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women . The makers of the ways and the makers of the works are each of variegated origin , environment , sensibility , discipline and interests . Neither the artist our the critic is a suddencreation , vocalizing in a void ; the critic certainty is not . He has a biography , and his biography is the indemiscible corapenetration of origin , sensibility , discipline and interest , re . sponding as it may to a manifold and changing environment of men , things , institutions and ideas . His character as critic consists of these responses . They are not primary , but eventua/ . They are last terms of the give and take that goes on continuously between him and the total contents of his experience . Among the items of this give and take are works of art . Whenever any person 's totality of responses are brought to a focus and drawn into a pattern by a work of art , the potentiality of criticism has come awake in him . When he utters those responses in words , the awakened potentiality becomes operative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elaboration and refinement of his verbalized responses will then make him professional . What , however , the critic , whether professional or amateur , says about a work of art or about the artist who made it is not alone determined by the character of his theme one his own character . The effective determinants are in the pattern of his relationships to the world he lives in , and the place that the theme finds among the processes of experience which make up this pattern . In these , his ruling passions are the lines of force . His criticism , hence , will be an expression primarily of the fortunes of his ruling passions , conscious and unconscious , as those are prospered or defeated by the contact with his theme . It will reveal how the work of art or its author is modifying the critic 's destiny . That is , it will be a moral judgment , a verdict regarding better and worse . It can not , in the nature of things , be anything else . To denounce criticism for moralizing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ethical " judgment ? is an absurdity of the classifying habit of mind . In living ex. per once there are no such compartments . Thought invents them as methodological conveniences . Living means simply to prefer one standard or instrument or purpose to another ? Mr. Sherman 's to Mr. Mencken 's or Mr. Spingarn 's to Mr. Babbitt 's . But a choice among standards is not a rejection of standards . Rather is it a confirmation of their reality and an acknowledgment and demonstration of their variety and multiplicity . Their confrontation , conflict , dissolution or integration are no less the nature and life of crit- icism than of any other discipline of the mind or the body . How entirely and perfectly this is so stands out in the fact that critics of the school of Messrs . Spingarn and Mencken do write to be ' read , and to speak to be heard , Expression , an and file sich , is soliloquy . It intends no communication ; it only registers an impact , like the meow of a cat whose tail has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over and done with . Not on with the expressions of the critica/ expressionists . They are addressed to an audience . They carry meanings which their authors intend their audiences to share . They are communications , and their function is not served unless they do effectively communicate . The audiences ? their powers , interests , needs , wishes , prejudices , fears and hopes ? are automatically and ineluctably constituents of the conditions which make the expression what it is . They are conditions which the expression is designed to alter into greater harmony with the ruling passions of the copressors . That is the latter 's hope and purpose , and these are served only in so far as the artist or critic is , in Mr. Babbitt 's admirable phrase , disciplined to reality , to the reality , the stubborn and resistent reality , particularly , the far from easily pliable reality , of the ruling passions of the public to whom , willy-nilly , all expressions are expressed . Now the expressions of the critic must be made under still another limitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses his audience directly with his own meanings . The being of these is inwardly-governed ; their qualities are autonomous ; they need not be ? though , of course , they often are ? referred to anything else , to be accepted or rejected . They are not interpretations , not mediations . The critic 's works are almost always interpretations and mediations . His communications are about something else , out there , which evokes them , and which they envisage and appraise to somebody else , out there , to whom he addresses them . If , in fact , the only meaning that he can convey to that somebody is himself , then Mr. Somebody has been sorely deceived . For Mr. Somebody does not heed the critic because he is interested in the critic . Mr. Somebody heeds the critic because he is interested in that which the critic is talking about . In the turmoil and welter of books and pictures and dreams whose number , variety and quality have been an overwhelmingly increased with the extension of industry through our civilization , Mr. Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek the more excellent for himself . He will not adventure like Childe Roland . He looks to gUidance . He tools to expert guidance . The critic , whatever his class or status , and whatever his conceit may be of his own function , whether priestly or Ciceronic , or Napoleonic , supplies this guidance . His craft is to be Taster of the Area to the Public . The act of guidance may be elaborated with all sorts of flourishes and ornamentation . It may be called " creation " ? and why should it not ? ? " expression " or any-thing else you like , but it is the foundation for whatever this else is . A cornmunicative expression , it advises the public about an artist or a work of art . If , in creating the presumption that it is doing so , the critic makes it communicate only himself , simulating the artist or work of art , what is the critic ? But the practice of the very expressionists who imply that the critic is joist that , is far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has entirely nullified himself . There is nobody mediating between the work of art and the audience . Its members can each on his own account become a purple cow . Assume , on the other hand , that it is the purple cow that is assimilated by the critic instead of the critic by the cow , then there is nothing left for the critic to mediate to the audience hanging upon his word for illumination and judgment regarding this same Juno ; In sum , even if the expressionist utterance purposes only to convert the public to expressionism and to stretch all the worts of man on a Pro-Croceian bed , there is more to the critic 's activity than just expression . A function is added , above and beyond expression , and it is precisely in this added function that criticism consists . For the fundamental dogma of the Moses of the expressionist sect , that all expression is net and that all art is expression , is either an empty paradox reached by dialectic or an altogether obvious , ancient and trivial truism . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former it is not worth a quarrel . In either event , the recent much ado about it is much ado about nothing . This world of ours of time and change and chance yields no event for us to experience and none for us to conceive except as arising out of another going before and merging into another coming after . What , then , can anything be , save an expression of something else , an effect pointing to a cause behind it ? Not only art , everything , is expression . Everything ; including the criticisms of Messrs . Sherman , Babbitt , Brooks and Brownell . In this world of chance and change and time , where new things are constantly coming to be out of old things , everything is creative ; the criticism of the moralists no less than the criticism of the expressionists . But ? creation and expression are the merest beginnings of the story . The history and significance of any work of man are eventual , not constitutive . They accrue to it after it has been expressed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accretion . Chance and fortune play no mean reles in it ; its maker 's purpose or its critic 's good intentions are no more than starting points in its career , whose changes may alter its direction and tram-form its nature beyond all recognitiot by the first intention that made it or the first insight that envisaged it . For it happens into a world with which its fitness is not a forgone conclusion , but a hazardous achievement . It becomes one more item in a fluxful crush of competing groups , institutions , and individuals whose alignments , shifting ever into new patterns , make up all the life that society possesses ; and among them it must establish its place , and with them struggle to maintain this place . Those which it fits will initiate it into their community ; those it clashes against will reject it . Its function and status will arise out of these dual activities of initiation and rejection . Such beauty or ugliness as is attributed to it will accrue from these relationships ; so also such goodness or truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he too often repeated , are not intrinsic but adventitious . They are uses , modifications of fortune and status . And intrinsically , nothing has a use ; everything simply becomes . Uses are eventual , special and propitious relationships betters different things , and beauty supervenes on them as their integration upon a system of interests . Criticism is what occurs at the critical point invents history where initiation , rejection or integrationan takes place . The standards and methods of the critics are as wide and as varied as the groups whose organs of expression they willy-nilly are . The cross-fire of their disputation is but one of the battle-noises of the classes and sects into which mankind are patterned , the one which is dialectically projected as an " azsthetic philosophy , " or a theory of Mu Only a vicious abstractionism , an aesthetic and moral imperialism will demand to reduce their multitude and variety to one only method and one only form . Only a reforming zeal , a dogmatism as arbitrary and puritanical on its own behalf as traditional Puritanism is on its , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what vision he shall follow or what method he shall apply . Tide . Van Wyck Brooks is of the Genro of the Younger Generation ; but he is a critic with as reformist an ardor as Mr. Stuart Sherman . Mr. Joel Spingarn is the chief , and happily perhaps , the only major , prophet in America of the revamped and italianate neo-Hegelisms of the dialectician Croce ; but 4 is he therefore less eager a missionary than that puritanical mossback from the academic Main Street , Mr. Irving Babbitt ? As for Mr. Mencken ; is there anybody but Mr. Sumner who can match his drive and forthrightness m a preacher and reformer ? It is in the direction of their reforms that they are opposed ; not in the urge to reform . Criticism , seen truly and seen whole , appears as a labile and indefinite enterprise engaging all kinds and varieties of men , and developing , under the organizing pressure of the various social forces of which it is an expression and to which it is a response , into a definite institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their loose hierarchies , from the sophomore making his start on a daily paper to the oo/yumnist seeing his finish there ; and from the colyumnist to the high churchmen and metaphysicians of the craft , the Menckens , the Babbitts , the Brooks et al . Each bears his part in an enterprise that is not an essence which can be deduced from general principles , but a pat- terned aggregation of an many similar activities of as many different individuals ; activities going on in a world in which business , science , politics , fashion , disease , war , religion and what not else ineluctably interpenetrate with the arts and letters . They can not , without artificiality and violence , be separated out in such a way that a residue called art may in fact be left . Unfortunately for those desiring or asserting such a separation , it happens that the arts , and therefore criticism , are significant precisely in the degree in which they are conver.nt with exactly those to-be-rejected matters . Criticism is like politics and critics are like politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerities and philosophies ; with their practice of claiming exclusive integrity to the pretensions of their own party and compromising as practical men with the integrities of whatever others are powerful enough to force recognition . There is no mystery about politics , however , and no sacerdota/itin about the politician . We automatically discount the claims of parties and partisans to be the sole bearers of political salvation . But for obvious reasons , critics carry a priestly aurea about themselves ; criticism is distended with a large sizing of mystification and hokum in the shape of " aesthetic philosophy " and the like ; its position of authority naturally makes it pontifical . The arts and their criticism are all too often suffused therefore with that familiar dim religious light on which authority most thrives . ' Nufi sed . And where , finally , in ail this ratiocination , does America came in ? America , alas , does not c ome in. except a , cidentally , and by way of illustration . It is true that Mr. Van Wyck Brooks and Mr. Stuart Sherman and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members of the galaxy take pains to declare its deficiencies in the line of criticism . But that is all by the way . There is no real specification of the status and function of criticism in America . The argument is a confrontation of opposed philosophies of art criticism it-hose range is , of course , universal and whose validity is independent of time , place and circumstance . We are permitted to infer the implications for America of these universals . This , in my view , is most unfortunate . The events of criticism are unhappily no more amenable to universals than any other social occurrences . They can not be deduced from general rules , even though they are general rules themselves . To exhibit the function and status of criticism in the United States would require the exhibition and analysik of the specific sequence of the critical literature of the country from the first , with its processes and permutations in the complex of the national life of which they are an active and activated part , and of whose tradition they are , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would emerge from such a study , perhaps many . But only such a study , empirical , particularistic , genetic and inductive , could envisage the staus and function of criticism in the America as fact . What Mr. Spingarn and his moralizing fellow-reformers set up is legislation for description and prescription for analysis .
