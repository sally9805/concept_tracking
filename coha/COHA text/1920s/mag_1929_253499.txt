The House and Senate , in joint session in the House 's chamber , went through the ceremonious anachronism of counting the electoral vote and making the official discovery that Herbert Clark Hoover had been elected President , and Charles Curtis Vice President , of the U. S. <P> In the green days of the Republic , this Constitutional rite was . a solemn thing , freighted with great uncertainty . Last week 's vote-counting became an occasion for 40 minutes of horselaughs and whoopee . The outward forms , the ancient lines and cues , seemed as comical to those Congressmen who bothered to attend , as would have been the spectacle of a gentleman in knee breeches and powdered wig riding down Pennsylvania Avenue in a sulky . <P> Vice President Dawes was master of ceremonies . Senate Pages Milburn McCarty Jr . of Eastland , Tex. , and John Gordon Logan , carried the two shiny mahogany boxes in which reposed the solemn electoral certificates . Page McCarty is a squint-eyed little boy with a round face , a slight lisp , freckles , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brown Derby during the campaign as personal messenger . He wept honestly when Nominee Hoover was elected . Alert , respectful , he is the Senate 's favorite page . Page Logan is Senator Smoot 's grandson . <P> Senators , strolling in , took front-row seats . Senator Curtis went for a stroll in the Capitol grounds . His runner-up , Senator Robinson of Arkansas , dallied in the vacant Senate cloak room . Four tellers-California 's Shortridge and Utah 's King for the Senate ; Alabama 's Jeffers and Massachusetts ' Gifford for the House-ranged themselves importantly before the rostrum . The boxes were unlocked . To Mr. Jeffers was handed the first envelope . He broke the red registry seal and announced : <P> " The certificate of the electoral vote of the State of Alabama seems to be regular in form and authentic and it appears therefrom that Alfred E. Smith received 12 votes for President and Joseph T. Robinson received 12 votes for Vice President . " <P> This formula was followed through the 47 other States , alphabetically , Senator Shortridge 's sepulchral voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island 's full name-The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantation-was carelessly omitted . Mr. Gifford modified the formula when he announced that Massachusetts " seemed " to have gone for Smith . " Whoopee ! " cried the Democrats . A Republican rebel yell punctuated the Texas and Virginia votes . <P> The tellers made a perfunctory count , handed up a tabulation to Vice President Dawes who read : <P> " Herbert Hoover , for President , 444 votes ; Alfred E. Smith , 87 votes . Charles Curtis , for Vice President , 444 votes , Joseph T. Robinson , 87 votes . This announcement of the state of the vote . . . shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected President and Vice President of the United States . . . . "
