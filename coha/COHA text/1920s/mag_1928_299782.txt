Oh , Kay ! There were three outstanding reasons for going to see the music show whence this cinema derived its name , part of its plot . Those reasons-Gershwin music . Gertrude Lawrence , Oscar Shaw-are missing in the movie . Instead there is Colleen Moore , never a great inducement for movie going , hardly more than usual in this offering , which tells of a noble English girl who , besieged by ennui and an unwanted suitor , goes down to the sea in a small ship , drifts into a storm , is rescued by rum-runners . <P> The Sawdust Paradise . Than Esther Ralston few are more lovely , than Hobart Bosworth few more noble . Somehow La Ralston failed to be convincing as the circus Hallie whom an evangelist ( Bosworth ) denounced because she ran a shell game . She was arrested , paroled in the evangelist 's care . She gets religion , almost loses her boy friend ( Reed Howes ) , but inevitably wins him over to the cause of righteousness . <P> Submarine . Handsome Jack Dorgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was much horseplay and jostling , which , as every cinemaddict knows , is the way strong men have of showing affection for each other . Handsome Jack ( Jack Holt ) has an affair with Snuggles ( Dorothy Revier ) , grows so fond of her ways that he actually marries her . Unknown to Handsome Jack , Snuggles seduces Best Friend Mason who happens to be a member of a submarine crew . When Jack learns that there has been an affair he is angry with his friend . The submarine in which Mason is cruising is sunk . Dorgan is the best diver in the service , but he refuses to try to reach the boat . Not until he discovers that his wife , not his friend , was the seducer , does he go into the water . <P> In the part of wily Snuggles Dorothy Revier has good moments . She had sinned , was therefore abandoned when her husband rescued her lover . Husband , lover renewed their friendship ; the faithless wife was left to her own vices.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
