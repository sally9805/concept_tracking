" We cheerfully accept the will of the majority . . . . " - John Raskob . <P> Michigan 's chief prohibiter , the Rev. R. N. Holsaple , wrote Mr. Raskob a letter . Did Mr. Raskob mean that he &; friends would now comply with the spirit-of-the-law and abstain from liquor ? <P> It sounded like a catch question , but it was doubtless put most earnestly . Prohibiters everywhere viewed the election as a final sealing if not a sanctification of the country 's war-bride , Volsteadism . <P> From his publicity-pulpit the Rev. John Roach Straton , of Manhattan , cried : " Victory was won by the preachers and by the God-honoring women of America . I pay tribute to one of the Joans of Arc of this campaign-Mabel Walker Willebrandt . I declare the feeling in my own heart when I say there has not been a finer piece of public service performed by anyone in modern days than that put across by Mrs. Willebrandt . " <P> President Miss Anna A. Gordon of the World W. C. T. U. rejoiced : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world the news that America overwhelmingly supports Prohibition . " <P> <P> Another W. C. T. U. proclamation said : " No issue other than Prohibition could have sent women to the polls by the millions . " <P> Clarence True Wilson , General Secretary of the Board of Temperance , Prohibition and Public Morals echoed the Anti-Saloon League 's prompt exultation ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) and said : <P> " The overwhelming defeat . . . should remove the issue of prohibition permanently from the field of partisan politics , where it never had a legitimate place . <P> " It is to be hoped that since prohibition is evidently not to be repealed , there will now be a subsidence of agitation against it , which can only be obstructive and prejudicial to the economic and moral welfare of the nation . <P> " It can not be too strongly stressed that this election was a referendum upon the issue of prohibition . . . . <P> " We pledge to President-elect Herbert Hoover the untiring support and earnest prayers of Methodists throughout the land to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-old evil of drink shall prevail . " <P> Making certainty doubly certain that Dryness was , at least outwardly , more ascendant than ever , were the Congressional returns . As every one knows , few Congressmen vote as they drink . Outspokenly wet Senators are especially rare . Next year they will be rarer . The two wettest-Maryland 's Bruce and New Jersey 's Edwards-lost their seats . So did Rhode Island 's Gerry , Delaware 's Bayard . Missouri 's vindictive Reed retires and Missouri 's Roscoe C. Patterson will be dry . <P> In the House , Representative John Charles Linthicum of Maryland , leader of the " wet bloc , " was re-elected and so were most of his most vigorous bloc-mates-New York 's Sirovich , La Guardia , Black ; Illinois ' Sabath , Britten ; Missouri 's Dyer . But Representative S. Harrison White , wet Coloradoan , is out and Maryland 's John Philip Hill , Leader Linthicum 's predecessor , failed to get back into Congress . All this in the face of the best efforts of the Association against the Prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
