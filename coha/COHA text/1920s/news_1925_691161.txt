Thus on the more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper profits are calculated , roughly of course , because no one but Mr. Durant knows the exact Size of his holdings , at $2,5061 , 000 . Excited by ' the pyrotechnics in this stock , which has advanced almost perpendicularly from $150 per share to its closing price of $235.50 at last night 's close , the story has been frequently started in the financial district that there is a " corner " in it .

Expensive for Bears . Incidentally , this stock has cost the bear party on the Stock Exchange a great deal of money in the last few months . Individual bears have bucked the market almost every day , usually to " cover at a loss , " having been outguessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one-half of the capital stock in his own accounts but also with being able to locate almost every other share of the entire capital . Almost every day some bold speculator tries to " feel for the top " and sells some shares . He has usually found that he has sold them directly to Mr. Durant . ?

This was voted by directors on Jan. 22. when $5.01 was paid , thus clearing up the arrears . The preferred dividend for the year also was declared at that time , Rumors of a Dividend . The flame of speculation in this stock has been fanned by the report that it soon will be split up , on a four-for-one or a five-for-one basis , and the new stock put on a. dividend basis . This , however , is only stock market rumor , and the actual advance has been through determined buying by Mr. Durant , his associates and the following he has been able to build up in Wall Street . The come-back of William C. Durant from the time he was " taken over " by bankers and the General Motors Cor- poration , of which he had twice been the head , was taken away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent market history . His fall occurred in the period of deflation . Since that time , through his effsii is as head of the motor company which bears his name , but mostly through his successful stock market operations , the name of Durant has become the best known in Wall Street .
