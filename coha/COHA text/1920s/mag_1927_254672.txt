Along shaded campus walks of Washington University , St. Louis , last week strolled a procession of St. Louis notables , of university professors , of college-departing seniors . <P> On every head but one rested a flat-topped , tasseled cap ; all but one pair of legs marched swathed in the folds of the academic gown . The lone exception was Vice President Charles Gates Dawes , who , with silk hat , striped trousers , frock coat and pale blue , pearl-studded tie headed the parade. * He was to deliver the Commencement Address to the 1927 Class of Washington University . <P> Platitudinous , innocuous as may be most commencement speeches Vice President Dawes observed not the bromidic tradition . Mounting a platform fringed with potted plants , he put his manuscript on a pedestal before him , gripped the pedestal with both hands , read . Soon those members of his audience who may have been acquainted with developments concerning the appointment of U. S. delegates to the Geneva Conference , sat straight up , leaned forward or otherwise shifted their persons to positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " War lessons should make us distrustful of too great an extension of the policy ... of educating and using career men for diplomacy . For the routine diplomatic work in peace time it may be well enough , but the psychology engendered by a peacetime career in diplomacy is often fatal to diplomatic emergencies . Career men , capable of a career , can be and now are being used in our diplomacy , but care must be taken lest the development of a right of seniority in promotion . . . does not have its dire result on the future of American diplomacy . . . . <P> " We need to be cautious about putting up career men , simply because they are career men . . . against the able negotiators in first authority now practically conducting the diplomatic negotiations of European countries . ... I do not have individuals in mind . But . . . any custom of appointments and promotions involving career men must never dull the sharp discretion which the appointing power should employ in selecting our best men for our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his speech , the Vice President attended a luncheon , then changed to a brown checked tweed suit and grey fedora hat , watched a ball game in which the Boston Nationals defeated the world 's champion St. Louis Nationals , 12 to 5 . <P> Next day Washington fussed , buzzed . For had not Ambassador ( to Belgium ) Hugh S. Gibson just been appointed to head the U. S. delegation to the approaching Geneva Arms conference ? Is not Mr. Gibson eminently a " career man " ? Both England and Japan have appointed " able negotiators of first authority " to attend the Conference . The very question discussed generally by Mr. Dawes had been discussed specifically with regard to Mr. Gibson for weeks preceding his appointment . It had been rumored that Charles Evans Hughes had been asked , had refused , to take the post . <P> In view of these circumstances , had not Vice President Dawes selected rather an inopportune time to debate career men v. special emissaries ? This question , impertinent , found no official answer . <P> <P> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has refused them steadfastly .
