The famed port-city of Tientsin , from which Peking is reached , was surrounded on three sides , last week by Nanking Nationalist Armies and then quietly occupied . <P> . Of Tientsin 's former militarist masters the last to evacuate was blunt , bearish Marshal Chang* Tsung-chang , notorious during the present Civil War for his ruthless cruelty ( TIME , March 7 , 1927 ) . As Chang 's armored train pulled out for Manchuria , he growled to correspondents : " I wo n't answer questions ! How should I know how many men I 've got left , or how much money I 've got left , or how many wives I 've got left ? " <P> . Luckless Chinese businessmen of Tientsin were " squeezed " by Chang Tsung-chang , last week , for over $300,000-a bribe which this Super-Brigand shamelessly exacted with threats that if it were not paid he would sack the city before evacuating . <P> . With the capture of Tientsin following that of Peking ( TIME , June 4 ) the Nationalist flag now flies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not part of " China proper , " but lies out side the Great Wall . <P> . Flushed with new potency the Nationalist Government issued last week an open declaration to all the Powers . <P> Excerpts : <P> " For eighty years China has been under the shackles of unequal treaties . . . . <P> " We are pleased to note since the latter part of 1926 that the spokesmen of the Powers have expressed their willingness to negotiate new equal treaties . <P> " Now that the unification of China has been consummated , we think the time is ripe ... to begin at once to negotiate . . . new treaties on the basis of complete equality and mutual respect for each other 's sovereignty . <P> " With profound sincerity , the National ist Government in the name of the people of all China makes the foregoing declaration to the whole world . " <P> . Statesmen thought that the Nationalist Declaration will lead to negotiations of the very largest world import , IF , and only if the vast and various armies and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work themselves ing solidarity . Such professed National ists as Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang , who has a personal army of 195,000 men , are capable of resuming the status of regional dictators they have held in the past . <P> The North China Daily Mail said significantly last week : " Whether he uses his strength for good or evil , Feng Yu-hsiang is the strongest man in China today . . . . <P> " Despite opinions to the contrary , we cherish the hope that it will be for good . " <P> . Prospect of further conflict loomed when fiery Nationalist General Pai Chung-hsi , " The Hewer of Communist Heads , " declared at Peking , last week , that the Nationalist Armies will now extend their authority over Manchuria , while their enemies " scatter like dead leaves before the rising wind . " <P> . Since Japanese colonists teem in Manchuria , the spread of Chinese civil war to that province would be of gravest international concern ; and the Japanese Government has long since averred that it will intervene to prevent such an eventuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
