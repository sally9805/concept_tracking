The Lords <P> Welcomed into their House with a quaint five-minute ceremony , the Most Reverend Father in God Cosmo Gordon Lang , new Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of All England . <P> Entered the Primate and the Bishops of Southwark and London , his introducers , wearing black caps . Solemnly stalwart Cosmo Gordon Lang presented his great patent of office to Baron Hailsham , the Lord High Chancellor . Next the three black caps paraded solemnly around the chamber to the back bench of the Lords Spiritual . Seating themselves , the Primate and Bishops faced the Lord High Chancellor , rose , bowed , removed their black caps , and lastly with finality and weight resumed their seats . <P> The Commons <P> Virtually ignored the most historic event of the week , though attention was duly called to it by His Majesty 's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , bleak , precise Sir Austen Chamberlain . The event ( see China ) was formal recognition by the greatest empire ( British ) of the most populous Republic ( Chinese ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order fired , last week , by a British warboat , the first salute ever received by the new President of China from one of the Great Powers . Three months ago the U. S. State Department was on the verge of ordering such a salute , but procrastinated , thus allowing Britain to steal the 21-gun thunder . Since long-memoried Chinese attach extreme importance to such events and are apt to celebrate them with " anniversaries " for decades or centuries , the salute of last week may be deemed the smartest move made by Sir Austen Chamberlain in 1928 . <P> Shouted down Sir Austen Chamberlain when he resumed his exasperating habit of telling the House both too little and too much about what his Foreign Office is doing . In touching upon last fortnight 's meeting of Europe 's " Big Three " - Chamberlain , Briand , Stresemann-during the regular Winter Session of the Council of the League of Nations , Sir Austen confirmed by implication sensational rumors that the Allies plan greatly to accelerate their evacuation of the Rhineland . <P> Pressed for details , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations the impression that circumstances are favorable to a solution of the Evacuation and Reparations problems if further polemics can be avoided while the experts are performing their task . That is all I can say at present in the public interest and in the interests of peace . " <P> Laborite shouts of disapproval caused Sir Austen to ask if he might make a personal plea to the House against " polemics ; " whereupon " Noes " were hurled until the Foreign Minister sat down , growling testily , " Oh , very well-very well ! "
