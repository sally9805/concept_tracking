Six months silent , the Capitol on Monday again rumbled and bumbled with the confusion of many voices that tells the country Congress is in session . Like reluctant school boys , Senators and Representatives came trooping back to open the second session of the 70th Congress . <P> A bare breeze riffled the three flags atop the nation 's law factory . The air was mild and misty . Many people , spectators , workers , newsmen , scurried around the wide plazas . Big autos zipped back and forth importantly . <P> It took the House 60 minutes to plow through the hoary formalities of getting down to legislative business , the Senate 15 . Then , exhausted , they both adjourned , to receive the President 's message ( see p 9 ) . <P> Ahead of them stretches a flexible program . Nine apropriations bills must be passed before March 4 to finance the governmental machine after July 1 . Boulder dam , 15 new cruisers for the Navy , the Kellogg anti-war treaty-these are the Senate 's immediate job . In the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reapportionment . Farm relief casts a streaky shadow of uncertainty across all plans and farther in the background lurks tariff revision . <P> Long before the noon hour of meeting , members congregated on the House floor to talk , to listen , to laugh , to mill around , to exude cordiality , to slap backs , to wring friendly hands , to encircle familiar shoulders . Two prime conversational topics predominated : <P> 1 ) The election and how it went , precinct by precinct , in each Congressional district . <P> 2 ) The unwelcome possibility of an extraordinary session of the 71st Congress after March 4 . <P> Little reception knots formed about the House floor . Veterans , committee chairmen , held court . The four women members , all in black , greeted their many admirers . New York 's Snell ( Rules Committee ) stood behind his aisle table , frowning , sharpening a pencil with a blunt watch chain knife . Leader Tilson beamed at his flock and rearranged neatly typed resolutions on blue paper . The galleries , splotched with color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker 's wife , was there , incognito , because she failed to remove her brown hat and reveal her gleaming hair . <P> Suddenly lights flashed on in the glass-paneled ceiling , with theatre footlight effect . Instead of a rising curtain , Speaker Longworth , with jaunty step , mounted the rostrum , struck his gavel twice upon the block and called above the din : " The House will be in order . " Opposite him the hands of the big gilt clock exactly met at the top of the dial . <P> Chaplain Montgomery prayed for three minutes . From gallery corners cameras clicked and movie men cranked , grateful for the brief immobility of the house . Its membership was caught by the prayer in disordered patterns . <P> " Alabama-John McDuffie-Here. "
