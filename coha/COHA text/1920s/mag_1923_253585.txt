Senator Cummins of Iowa , Chair-man of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce , called at the White House to discuss the railroad situation . After the meeting , he gave fairly clear indication of how the Administration will try to handle the politico-railway problem . <P> On one hand are the railways themselves , who want to continue operation under the Esch-Cummins Law of 1920 . On another hand are farmers and shippers in general , clamoring for lower freight rates . From still another quarter the railroad workers are prepared to demand any arrangement to the advantage of the workers-government ownership , if practical . Then there is the public- mutely desirous of the best possible service ; the La Follette-Brookhart radical group in Congress-prepared to push attempts for drastic changes . <P> Said Senator Cummins : <P> " I think consolidation of the railroads as initiated by the Transportation Act offers the only means of gaining for the country the efficiency the people require . To me it seems to be the only method through which we may bring down freight rates . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its program the plans being drawn by the Interstate Commerce Commission . The 1920 Transportation Act directed the Commission to prepare tentative plans for consolidating the railroads . This was done , and in August , 1921 , a plan for uniting the roads into 19 systems was announced . Then the Commission set about comparing notes with the railroads and getting their suggestions on consolidation . Hearings were held for the railways west of the Mississippi and for the railways south of the Ohio . On May 16 hearings will be opened at Washington for the railroads of the north and east . By Fall the final plan of the Commission should be ready .
