txt Mr. LA FOLLETTE accepted the nomination of the Conference for Progressive Political Action before he was nominated . It was hard to prevent the conference from nominating him before he accepted . Such is the enthusiasm of his miscellaneous devotees at Cleveland . There is nothing new in his long letter . He 's going to run as an Independent Progressive candidate , not as that of a third party . The distinction seems metaphysical , though it pains some of the Socialists . He is the regular Republican boss in his own State . He will have an electoral ticket in every State ; but in the interest of his bloc in Congress he does n't want a complete third party ticket next Fall . Some of the faithful Senators and Representatives might be defeated . Most of these gentlemen are conspicuous by their absence from Cleveland . They know which side their bread is buttered on . In Iowa and Nebraska . for instance , they will continue to " bore in , " preferring ' to help themselves at the polls in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The convention system Mr. LA For. - LETTE views with alarm . He has tried it every four years for the last sixteen ; and his candidacy and platform have n't thrived under it . Now he has got a body that will eat out of his hand as does his Republican Party in Wisconsin . With his wonted disdain of facts , looking Inward and not outward , he reiterates the ancient Ocala-Omaha wail : In a land of untold wealth , dedicated to the principles of equal opportunity for all , special privileges to none , %life has become a desperate struggle for the average man and woman . The millions at work on the farms . in the mines , in transportation , In the factories and shops and stores , with all their industry , and saving , find themselves poorer at the end of the year than at the beginning . Some of the railroad brotherhood plutocratic chiefs at Cleveland must have grinned when they heard that . As usual , this is " the most women " tous crisis which has confronted the " nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " most momentous crisis " ; and " the supreme issue , " equally as usual , " in " volving all , others , Is the encroach " ment of a powerful few upon the " rights a the many . " Mr. ' LA FOLLETTE is opposed to class legislation , except for farmers , laborers and soldiers . He is ferocious against private monopoly . He merely wants to create a Government monopoly of railroads and water power . Shrewd railway employes must be more than a little doubtful about the promised boon of Government ownership of railroads . The Government as an employer might interfere with the privileges and powers of the ' labor unions . The Anthracite Coal Commission intimated as much to the miners and notably cooled their zeal for " nationalization . " ' But the La Follette platform , the Wisconsin primary platform , has been spread . before the country . often enough ; and Mr. LA FOLLETTE will dilate upon it for months without mitigation or remorse of voice , . if his health permits . We content ourselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and his interesting statement that " had Faig " land , France and Germany been " under Liberal Governments in 1914 , " there would have been ? no World " War . The surest reliance against " war is democracy . " It is a curious fact that the opposition of Mr. LA FOLLETTE and his followers , some of them still in Congress , to the war seemed to be founded less upon objection to , war in general than to war against Germany . The course of most of the American Socialists on that subject is too Weil known . ' " We shall be/falsely accused , " says Mr. LA FOLLETTE , " of advocat " ing radical and destructive policies , " even while we alone are fighting " for the old principles upon which " this Government achieved its great " ness . " The accusation Is true . He is a Radical , not a Progressive . Was it by shackling the courts and private enterprise that the United States grew great ?          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
