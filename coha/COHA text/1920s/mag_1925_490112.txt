SINCERELY and respectfully we extend to Mr. Theodore Roosevelt Pell our congratulations on having bought the Clipper Ship Benjamin F. Packard and turned it into a public museum . It was a most civilized and altogether decent act . We only wish George F. Baker , who is even richer , had done as much for the Brevoort House when he bought it , instead of consigning the delectable old mansion to the wreckers . AS ever one hundred percent 1 1 American , Bishop Manning gave thanks on Thanksgiving Day for the decline of intolerance , and the Anti-Saloon League gave thanks for the decline of drinking , while elsewhere the Methodists gave thanks for being virtuous enough to want to abolish New York and the jewelers of Fifth Avenue gave thanks for an increase of 250% in the cocktail shaker business . WE observe that the newest apart- ment houses are advertising Fireplaces that Work . This means real chimneys . Avoiding the obvious joke about another flue epidemic , we may say it is a grate improvement . Fires are becoming . It is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE annual Report of the Direc- tors of the Illinois College Fund laments the passing of W. J. Bryan ' 81 as the " institutions 's most distinguished son since its foundation . " We understand that the reason the Directors say this is not to give Illinois a black eye , but to prove that Red Grange ( their other great man ) is a good football player because he knows he is not descended from a monkey . ALL doubt as to what makes music the California ear subsided last week . After hearing Paderewski , we met a Californian at dinner . " Oh yes , Paderewskil I saw in the paper he was here , " she said . " I suppose you know he has a ranch out in our State , " etc. , etc . We did n't mind  --  the lady on our other side was prettier anyway . WE are not entirely convinced that debutantes as a class object seriously to stags drinking . We used to believe that the poor girls were sacrificing their self respect to satisfy a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debs did n't exercise the boycott , which would have cured the drink evil in short order . But age has altered our opinion and put to rest our wonder . We now believe that the female always objects to the way the male treats her , and loves it . HOWEVER fashionable it may The for women to ride astride , our heart nevertheless went out to the few who last week in the Armory still clung to the pommel of their side saddle . It looks so much better . We do n't care who disagrees with us . The Week THIRTY thousand attend hang- ing in Greece on Thanksgiving Day and Gerald Chapman declines to accept commutation of sentence .

Triumph OUR weekly advice from Haysi- land informs us that Hollywood is again in the throes of one of the itches for authorship which occasionally sweep that intellectual center . There is a recurring aspiration among the more gifted and splendid males there to achieve the He-Man pinnacle in fiction and share honors with such lions as Mr. Zane Grey and Mr. James Oliver Curwood . The latest victim of this intellectual stirring has been one of the screen 's perfect profiles , who has been laboring on a novel . " How many words are there in a novel , anyway ? " he inquired from a scenario writer , who might be presumed to be a literary authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenarist . " Fine , " exclaimed The Perfect Profile . " That means I 've finished mine . " The New Order L : VE RYBODY tacitly agrees that it was an off year at the Horse Show ; but for an off year , it was a very good year . Everything was slightly altered . Even the management was changed . Mr. Moore is dead . And Mr. Bowman , famous for his hotels , has stepped in , which should mean , if nothing else , good food from now on . These things count . There was everywhere last week the touch of a younger hand and a modern day blotting out the old . The old Garden atmosphere was gone . But by way of compensation , the brass band was better than ever before ; the decorations were more complete ; the whole machinery moved with a precision not altogether in the tradition of the old regime . An eye , they say , was ever and anon leveled at the gate receipts . On the verandah of a replica of Mount Vernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debutante and her boy friend , whom the Horse Show used never to bother about . One guesses that the annual deficit , which Mr. Moore used to meet so placidly with his hand in his pocket , will be no more . Mr. Reginald Rives is credited with having got the exhibitors together , and he did a good job . He is Secretary and Treasurer of the new organization , and he and William du Pont , Vice President , and Mr. Bowman make up the triumvirate now in charge . Entries were varied and colorful , with plenty of European officers to give a cosmopolitan air , and young ladies in breeches , from California to give the title , National Horse Show , some meaning . Almost the most active exhibitor of all was Jean Browne Scott , who they say has a rein in her hand six days out of seven in all seasons . James Cox Brady , under the pseudonym of Hamilton Farms was not far behind her in energy . J. M. Willets nobly upheld the hackney end of things ; and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Fuller . Some of the exhibitors this year were old in the Horse Show , but not most of them . Alfred G. Vanderbilt is dead , and so is Reggie Vanderbilt . The clientele , on the whole , is younger . At the moment , the triumvirate wo n't say definitely what they plan for next year . The reason why the show was held in the Armory this year was that Rickard 's Garden was not completed in time to take care of it . Had this not happened , there probably would n't have been any off year ; and everyone supposes that next year Rickard will have it , and will make it once again the foremost event in the horse world . Another indefinite point is the future date . It used to be coincident with the Opera opening , but was changed on account of the strain the double function put upon enthusiasts who would rather die than miss either . Since then it has been first earlier and then later . Staggering it with the Opera is probably a good idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show is worth building up again , and there would he no sense in running it in competition with the most colorful event of the entire Fall Season . Original Hamlet THE forthcoming production of Hamlet with no clothes at all , which is to succeed the version of the classic in modern dress , has been the subject of no little conversation about town . We arc able , after investigation , to report that the idea originated from a witticism shared by no less than Mr. John Emerson and Miss Anita Loos ; but since their early inception of the idea , there has been a deluge of suggestions for casting the production , changes , replacements , THE NEW YORKER 3 new arrangements . It may still , however , be of interest to publish , of the many which have passed through our hands , one of the most complete prospectuses . It ran as follows : Negotiations are under way to secure Mr. Bernarr Macfadden for the part of Hamlet , and it is hoped that Miss Gaeta Grey will he the Ophelia . The Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the King by Mr. Ernest Boyd . Messrs . H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan will be the Gravediggers , and PoJunius will be played by Mr. Augustus Thomas . Voice of Ghost , Miss Ganna Walska ; Y crick ( Alas ! ) , Mr. Sam Shipman ; Horatio , Mr. Charles Hanson Towne ; Laertes , Mr. Maury Paul ( Chony Knickerbocker ) . The part of Rosencrantz , will be filled by Mr. Frank Munsey and other roles as follows : Guila'enstern , Mr. Cyrus H. K. Curtis ; fl Priest , Mr. David Belasco ; A Gentleman , Mr. Michael Arlen ; Fertinbras , Prince of Norway , the Marquis de la Falaise de la Coudrais ; English Ambassadors , Messrs . Noel Coward , Freddy Lonsdale , Cyril Maude , Ashley Dukes . In charge of Ladies Lounge , Mr. Rudolph Valentino ; vice versa , Miss Peggy Hopkins . Costumes by Elizabeth Arden . Bedroom settings by A. H. Woods . Fig leaves by John Sumner . A private undress rehearsal will be held February .2 gth next . Colosseum THE plumber was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seven days , and that money was n't worth it . This was the new Madison Square Garden  --  the Six Day Race . Plumbers , glaziers , electricians , plasterers madly looking for their foremen ; the lobby paved at five o'clock the afternoon of the opening ; the last board nailed to the track forty minutes before the doors were opened ; and Colonel J. S. Hammond , Mr. Rickard 's vice-consul standing around in knickerbockers and explaining , " Yes , we have a special runway for elephants in Forty-ninth Street , and we 've made the door extra wide in case they invent a bigger animal . " The new Madison Square Garden ( the gods forgive us ) is a veritable Foresight Saga , a masterpiece . Ice can be made in eight hours and melted in two . You can leave a boxing match at midnight and come back in the ? morning before the office opens and see a hockey match . In the afternoon a circus or an opera . There are steam pipes and compressed air pipes and twelve miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire , including the wire the Dare Devil slides down in Barnum 8 : Bailey 's . Under every seat is a ventilator . In the roof are great fans forcing ozone in at a rate that will change the air of the whole place in eleven minutes  --  dry ozone , warm in Winter and cool in Summer . There are two floors to the new Garden , an arena and an exhibition room beneath it . The Arena is finished in the simplest fashion . Its beauty is the beauty of engineering : white beams and white concrete . Every inch is filled with seats . One gets the impression that the spectators actually arch overhead from the fact that the two galleries protrude so far . The old Garden looked cluttered with supporting pillars ; the new does not . The old Garden looked inconvenient ; the new Garden looks eminently practical . The old Garden seated 13,00o ; the new Garden seats 17,000 . As to seats : they are all good ones , and at least six and a half times as comfortable as the torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where the sideshows will be . It is a room with many pillars , looking very cryptic . It is but rough plastered , as yet , lighted only by a few bulbs hanging on naked wires , and is silent except for the tramp of workmen . From the floor you can look up through the stairwell and see the engineers walking on the trusses overhead , a mile away . It is hard for anyone but the overworked plumber to say anything against the Garden . There is no Florentine Facade of course , but at the present moment there is a blank wall against which they say a hotel will go , and which is now seen from Eighth Avenue over the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla , of proportions that Picasso would call stunning . Sport THE sportiest proposal of the season was made , early on a morning , lately , when the first breath of frost was stirring , to a veteran cocher , half dozing on the box of his cab . A youth approached , in meticulous eve-Mg dress but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cab , sir ? " the jehu solicited . " No ; don ' wan na ride , " said the youth , after solemn consideration . " Tell you what , though . Wrestle your horse for twenty dollars . Give you th ' twenty if I do n't throw him in five minutes . " The cabby pondered this strange proposal , and , presently , assented . " Take his shoes off , " the youth commanded . But this point the cocher would not yield . His horse must remain shod , if there was to he a contest . " Bout 's off then , " the swaying one pronounced . " Only professionals wrestle with shoes on . I 'm ' n amateur . Bout 's off . " Mrs. Insull 's Fling ON Sunday night next George Ty- -1 let 's " School for Scandal " will stop off for one invitation performance on its way from Boston to Newark and points west . This is his way of acridly calling attention to the fact that he can not get a theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himself , perhaps ) by paying the rent in advance . This custom of guaranteeing a theatre against loss is a comparatively recent exaction , exceedingly painful to an old showman like Tyler and nothing short of infuriating to him in the light of the fact that , by dint of it , a production of this very play has been pre-empting the Little Theatre for weeks and weeks by sheer weight of - money and without the question of comparative merit even being permitted to enter in . For it is a secret de Polichinelle 4 THE NEW YORKER that it is not the public which is keeping Gladys Instill at her nightly romp as Lady Teazle on the Little Theatre 's stage . Mrs. Insull ( she as was Gladys Wallis in the W. H. Crane troupe a quarter of a century ago ) is the wife of the mighty Samuel Insull of Chicago , in which city scarcely a wheel turns or a lamp glows except at his pleasure . Now she has returned to the stage after years of retirement made endurable by occasional performances in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outskirts of Chicago . The great wave of applause which shook Chicago last Spring when Mrs. Insull played Lady Teazle for charity , swept that gratified veteran right on to Broadway where , after an opening night made notable by more floral tributes than have been flung across the local footlights in a generation , her handsome production has been running at a staggering loss since early October . The wiseacres say the whole adventure will cost Mr. Instill more than $ioo , 000 even if his lady should weary of the sport ere Michaelmas . But such pin money had been well spent on the glorious fun Mrs. Insull would have had if only the critics had been less glacial and even facetious in their reviews and if only the New York public had not stayed away in droves . Hucksters OCAL journalism excelled even L. its tabloid self in reporting the clinical aspects of the Rhinelander trial , but even the pink-sheeted early editions could not muster sufficient courage to print the famous letter which , at some future date , may be incorporated in the American parallel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , that transcripts of the letter did find their way into circulation , the streets in one part of town at least being populated , one might almost say thickly populated , with hucksters who husked to the male passerby : " Th ' Rhinelander letter , dollar a copy . Th ' real thing , mister ? not a woid left out . " The Last time we encountered these foggy-toned gentry was a year or so ago during a police parade . On that Spring day , when the Finest were thumping ponderous rhythm on the asphalted Avenue , little knots of men were conspicuous on the side streets . The core of each group was a slinking figure cautiously offering postal cards for sale  --  postal cards reminiscent of those which startled the A.E.F. in Paris . Extremely wary were these salesmen , and when a lady approached there was a warning from the side of the mouth : " Gen'mun in private conversation , lady . Gen'mun talking private . " The thought occurred that this business of selling risque postal cards is probably the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one day a year  --  when the police parade . Or , perhaps , these merchants work also in other cities . " I 've got to go to Cleveland on business next week . Big police parade out there , " we can imagine one of them saying . Last Agony WERE it not for the year 1883 , crowds of the curious would not now be tramping through the W. K. Vanderbilt residence . It was in that year that Hunt , the architect , whose statue showing him with blouse and chisel was put atop the house by appreciative and roguish workmen , designed it in the style of the chateau at Chenonceaux , thereby dealing a heavy blow to the hitherto supreme brownstone . Everybody who has ever been by Fifty-second Street thanks him , including the Vanderbias , excepting the second Mrs. W. K. , who prefers Sutton Place . Like everybody else , we went through the house last week with hushed voice , gaping at the room where the famous Vanderbilt Ball was given , and also gaping at the movie screen put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professional entertainers and the slot machine against the wall . It was a two women to one man affair , so the bathrooms , the closets , the pantry and the private stairway out of Mrs. Vanderbilt 's room drew most of the crowd . The dumb waiter was the piece Is resistance . It was pulled by probably ten thousand hands with practical wedding rings on them . All in all most entertaining . We wonder if the shades of the old names that once were formally called there went through with the rest- 0 . Mills , Pierre Lorillard , the first Morgan , Ward McAllister , who lived to see his phase die . Not , by any means , incidentally , are these names which arrived with the Vanderbilt name , which did , or nearly did , arrive with the house or at least with the Metropolitan Opera House , which came the same year . That was the time when the Academy of Music in Fourteenth Street was animate . It had Mrs. Astor 's patronage , and Mrs. Astor , though she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Mrs. Vanderbilt took a box and did sit in it . The situation was critical in 1883 and almost as important as the building of Brooklyn Bridge that year . And then the Academy died and Mrs. Astor had to come to the mountain , which put the biggest feather ever in the Vanderbilt cap . ? T was not only Mr. Bret Harte 's I Heathen Chinee who contributed to fastening upon poker its enviable reputation . The game has built about itself more safeguards than almost any other form of gambling ; and one of the oldest of these came back to mind forcibly when I entered Abercrombie &; Fitch 's place , bent upon the purchase of some new equipment . " I should advise against plain chips , " said the gentlemanly clerk . " So many people complain that they find the banker 's accounts never balance when plain chips are used . " There was a significant cough . " Chips with distinctive designs are THE NEW YORKER better from every point of view , " the gentlemanly clerk confided . Emissary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its officers are flooding the town with reminiscences of their visit to Australia , most enthusiastic of national hosts . So widely were our navy men fited , it appears , that it became necessary to appoint committees of one to represent each ship at the various functions for which invitations went out . It fell to the lot of a junior officer to make the rounds of various clubs which had extended privileges to American officers during the Fleet 's stay . In each one , of course , he was greeted by the secretary , and then by the president ? " and wo n't you have another ' spot ' , al ' cleah ? " Thus it went ; club after dub , " spot " after " spot " and , as the day wore into evening , the junior officer found himself wabbling uncertainly into yet another club . His stride was unsteady , his eyes a bit glazed , but the honor of the American Navy was in his keeping . He went on . When he managed to make a fairly straight entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed with introductions . The names seemed familiar . The places mentioned certainly were . " Of New York . " " Of Chicago . " " Of Dallas . " " Where am P " inquired the befuddled junior officer . " You 're in the American Club , " he was told . " Oh , my lord , " groaned the gallant sailor . " Now I 've got to do some real drinking . " Artist TT was announced as a " one-man show " of Bessie Lasky 's paintings ; and it was really through no fault of Mrs. Jesse Lasky that her exhibition in the Anderson Galleries was identified as the work of the wife of the prominent movie producer . The artist herself tried sincerely to avoid undue publicity  --  but who could expect complete escape when sales of canvases were being made to Mr. Samuel Goldwyn , for instance , and Mrs. Bowes , and Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld ? The show itself was interesting , but so are many other shows through the year , and it was only natural that the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lasky is slim and young . She wore , on the day we saw her , a simple frock of black satin . They say she was in attendance every day during the show , and that every day she was simply attired . Mrs. Lasky likes her own paintings ; indeed , she seemed pained when a sale was made  --  for a sale meant a parting . And the is not without a philosophical twist of mind . Surveying the crowd in the galleries , she murmured , " All the invitations seem to have gone astray except those mailed to Hollywood . " Boon THIS magazine has been ap- proached by a " gentleman who has formulated a plan which , at this date , promises to be of more service to humanity than anything perfected since the discovery of fermentation . In brief , it is his purpose to issue from a central bureau , a universal certificate which will identify the bearer as a person of unquestioned honor ; and so entitled to admission to any bootlegging establishment in town . If possible , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. banknote paper in order to guard against counterfeiting . This scheme , when it has achieved its ultimate development , will put an end to the greatest nuisance of our time . It will not be necessary to go to the trouble of procuring an introduction before one can be served in a new place . The identification card will be a city-wide passport . And , of course , the old cards of admission which have cluttered our billfolds for so long will be consigned to flames .
