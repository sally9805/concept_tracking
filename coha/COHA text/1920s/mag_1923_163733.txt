Sarjyut Shankerlal , recently released from Yeravda jail , where he was a fellow-prisoner of Mahatma Gandhi , contributed an article to Young India of Bombay , in which he described the existence of Gandhi in jail . <P> Excerpts : <P> " We were allowed an unlimited supply of books also from outside . Later , for health reasons , we were both of us allowed lights and bedsteads , and recently Mahatma Gandhiji has been allowed the use of a mosquito curtain . . . . While animal comforts are well looked after , he is mentally starved . . . . <P> " The public would be naturally anxious to know about Mahatma <P> Gandhiji 's present political views . . . . I have no messages from Mahatma Gandhiji , either private or public . . . . He swears by nonviolence , Charka , Hindu Moslem unity and the removal of untouchability . He spins with a distaff regularly every day for four hours , unless his eyes do not permit him . He reads largely religious books , chiefly the Gita and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now re-reading the Bible . " <P> Mahatma Gandhi was educated in England . During the War he organized an Indian ambulance for the British . After the War he started his movement of noncooperation , which enjoined his followers to : <P> 1 ) Refuse to recognize British rights in India . <P> 2 ) Take no part in Government of British Raj . <P> 3 ) Resign all Government posts . <P> 4 ) Refuse and return all British decorations . <P> 5 ) Use no violence . <P> The Court which tried Gandhi held that although Gandhi preached nonviolence , his movement of non-violent noncooperation , invariably ended in violence wherever his doctrine was spread . The Court therefore held that Gandhi was , in effect , a dangerous and seditious agitator . Gandhi refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the Court , and considers himself as a prisoner of war .
