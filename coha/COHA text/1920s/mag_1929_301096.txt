Coolidge v. Hoover <P> Sirs : <P> I notice in TIME . Dec. 16 , that Hoover is asking for appropriations for another commission . This " beaver man , ' ' as you called him last year , is undoubtedly starting things moving . Many of us old Timers are wondering if he is not undertaking too much . Personally I prefer the policy of his predecessor , who sat still , said nothing , and acted , when he acted , chiefly on the recommendations of big bankers-men who knew what they were doing . <P> PHINEAS LAWRENCE <P> Fall River , Mass . <P> Hurley 's Faith <P> Sirs : <P> TIME YOUR JUDGMENT HAS FLED TO BRUTISH BEASTS IMAGINE A ROMAN CATHOLIC SECRETARY OF WAR IN A KLU KLUX ANTI SALOON ADMINISTRATION TIME ACT YOUR AGE PATRICK HURLEY DOES NOT PROFESS THE ROMAN CATHOLIC FAITH . <P> FREDERICK J. KIENLE <P> Brooklyn , N. Y. <P> Sirs : <P> Not that it matters very much , but Secretary of War Hurley is not a Roman Catholic . If he were , what a blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had to be shelved because he confessed that faith . It may be that the Catholics claim Pat Hurley , but I know better . As I say , not that it matters except as such things are made to matter by the press , to which your magazine stands as a shining corrective . . . . <P> ALFRED A. AMBLER <P> Washington , D. C. <P> Secretary of War Hurley 's parents were Roman Catholics . His friends in Tulsa believe he is a Roman Catholic .

Senate <P> Sirs : <P> Speaker Longworth 's remarks on the Senate and the general merriment in the House at the idea of the Senate doing " business , " ( TIME , Dec. 16 ) raises an interesting question . <P> The House of Representatives undoubtedly gets through its business with commendable speed , although often we come to believe that it is accomplished through log rolling and the docile follow-the-leader voting of men who respect the machine which elected them . In the Senate again , business is undoubtedly oftentimes outrageously delayed , but we often suspect that the delays are caused by independent-thinking Senators who refuse to vote till they have aired the entire question . <P> It would be very interesting to hear from TIME readers on this question : which is better for the country , the speedy legislation of the House , or the delayed , much debated , sometimes contrary actions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ohio <P> House Flayed <P> Sirs : <P> The picture of " Mister Speaker " frontispiecing Vol .
