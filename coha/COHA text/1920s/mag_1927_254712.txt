Namiko San , a Japanese opera with libretto and music by Aldo Franchetti , features Tamaki Miura , Japanese soprano . Little Mme. Miura 's fingers are like daisy petals in careful array . Her voice carries a suggestion of tartness . Her movements are all nicely studied . Her role is that of a 16-year-old maiden of ancient Japanese legend , in love with a Buddhist monk from the white mountain tops , possessed by a tyrannous Daimio , lord of the low , broad acres . <P> <P> Lombardi , Ltd . Every sizable town and city in the U. S. has been visited by Leo Carrillo in this play , now re-revived by Producer Murray Phillips , in which the hero , as head and heart of a modiste business , breaks a volume of English dialogue over an Italian tongue . After the old-fashioned pattern of all such plots , Lombardi must experience business failure and heart-jolt before he awakens to the fact that it is not the dazzling beauty of Phyllis Manning that he loves but the demure companionship of Norah Blake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular admission charge . But most of the fun is supplied by Actor Carrillo himself , as Lombardi , whose spirit , dammed by linguistic obstructions of all kinds , nevertheless overflows everything in an indomitable , spluttering , blustering fuss . <P> <P> Julius Caesar . Every year the Players ' Club presents a classical drama for a short run . This year , during last week only , it was Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar , with incidental music by Charles L. Safford . The confusion of brilliance in the cast resulted from William Courtleigh ( Caesar ) , James Rennie ( Antony ) , Basil Rathbone ( Cassius ) , Tyrone Power ( Brutus ) , Mary Young ( Portia ) , Homer Croy ( Mob ) , Bruce Bairnsfather ( Mob ) . <P> <P> Baby Mine . Some 17 years ago , when a primitive U. S. cinema public chewed peanuts in its motion picture palaces , Roscoe Conkling ( " Fatty " ) Arbuckle started on his way to fame . Like other actors , he preferred what was then the greater glory and emolument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine was his first vehicle ( in stock company ) . In 1910 , they say , it was a smart and even froward thing . In 1927 , it looks like a bustle in a Shubert show . Mr. Arbuckle enacts a pulpy mass who alternately stews in sweaty fear and freezes in gelatinous embarrassment , because a lady of his acquaintance tries to win back her husband with a show of triplets , the same being potentially the offspring of any male in the cast . Actor Arbuckle , exiled from cinema , was cordially received on his return to the legitimate stage .
