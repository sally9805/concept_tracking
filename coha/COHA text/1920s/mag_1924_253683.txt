Who would have believed that the Democratic Party , choosing a National candidate , would ever again have scooped up a Bryan from the fishy deep ? " Another of the men before you has the misfortune to be my brother , " said William Jennings of Charles Wayland . Probably the elder Bryan spoke the truth and yet the Democratic Party turned to the younger Bryan , gave him its Vice Presidential nomination . <P> In the beginning , Charles Wayland followed his brother . He followed him from Illinois to Nebraska . There he set up a butcher shop in Lincoln . Later he turned to retailing cigars in Omaha . He was there when William Jennings launched out on the Spirit of ' 96 . <P> Again the younger man followed the elder man . He became his brother 's private secretary , then his business manager . That William Jennings can now comfortably recline on a sunny peninsula is in no small degree due to Charles Wayland 's good management . <P> It was on the elder brother 's departure for Florida that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone . His eyes gleamed down his firm nose , his moustache bristled . He had been running a couple of farms near Lincoln . Then he decided to run Lincoln . He first became Councilman , next Mayor . He set up a municipal coal pile and brought down coal prices .

The point against him was the name of Bryan , a very ill-tasting morsel , especially in the East . <P> Governor Bryan has a wife , a son Silas who is a lawyer in Minneapolis and a daughter whose married name is Mrs. W. E. Harnsberger . <P> One political writer distinguished between the brothers Bryan by saying that William Jennings has been an office seeker and Charles Wayland an office holder . <P> <P> *Mr . Bryan is not an advocate of Government ownership . Says he : " I am not in favor of Federal , State or Municipal ownership of anything except natural resources , such as water ; but when business combinations , particularly utilities and those supplying vitally necessary products , defy all authority and endeavor to mulct the public , then I think that the Government should sternly repress them , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
