APPLETON AND COMPANY NEW YORK LONDON MCMXX COPYRIGHT , 1920 , BY THOMAS DIXON PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO WILLIAM HARRIS , JR . WHOSE COURAGE AND HIGH IDEALS AS A PRODUCER GAVE TO THE AMERICAN STAGE THE EPOCH-MAKING PLAY ABRAHAM LINCOLN HISTORICAL NOTE While the popular conception of Lincoln as the Liberator of the Slave is true historically , there is a deeper view of his life and character . He was the savior , if not the real creator , of the American Union of free Democratic States . His proclamation of emancipation was purely an incident of war . The first policy of his administration was to save the Union . To this fact we owe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I try to make a living reality in my play . The scenes relating to the issues of our National life have been drawn from authentic records . The plot of the action is based on the letter of Colonel John Nicolay to Major Hay , dated August 25 , 1864 , in which the following opening paragraph is found : " Hell is to pay . The New York politicians have got a stampede on that is about to swamp everything . Raymond and the National Committee are here to-day . R. thinks a Commission to Richmond is about the only salt to save us ; while the President sees and says it would be utter ruination . The matter is now undergoing consultation . Weak-kneed damned fools are in the movement for a new candidate to supplant the President . Everything is darkness , doubt , and discouragement . " No liberty has been taken with an essential detail of history in the development of the action except to slightly shift the dates of two incidents for dramatic unity .

PROLOGUE SET SCENE : The rough-hewn log cabin of Tom Lincoln is seen in the center surrounded by the forest wilderness of Southern Indiana , 1820 . The cabin door is cut in level with the ground . There is no shutter to the door and no window to the cabin . Right and Left of the door opening are rude benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coon and a small bear , squirrel and muskrat skins . In the foreground on the right is seen an old-fashioned wash pot set on three stones . Near the wash pot is fixed in the ground a pole , on the top of which are hung six gourds cut for martin swallows to nest in . Beside it are a rude bench and two wash tubs . On the left is a crude settee made of a split log with legs set in augur holes and a rough back made of saplings . An old-fashioned doctor 's saddle-bags hang across the back of the settee . The trees are walnut , beech and oak  --  undergrowth of dogwood , sumac and wild grapevines . These vines , festooned over the cabin , give a sinister impression . A creek winds down through the hills behind the cabin . AT RISE : SARAH is seen softly tiptoeing toward the cabin door . She pauses , listens and slowly peeps inside . She listens again and then slips away and calls . SARAH Abe ! Abe ! SARAH goes back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe  --   --  ! Ma 's awake now ! She returns to the door , peeps in again and runs once more to the gate . Abe  --   --  ! He 's feelin ' her pulse ! Come on in  --  do n't stay out there in the woods .... ABE enters slowly . ABE What does he say ? SARAH He ai n't said nothin ' yet . ABE He 's a dumb doctor , anyhow . I could n't get him to say a word comin ' , last night . SARAH Well , he 's here now , and there 's his saddle-bags full of medicine . You 've been ridin ' all night  --  you look terrible tired !

Eagerly to DOCTOR . You can do somethin ' for her , Doctor ? DOCTOR Hesitates . Yes  --  Get me a clean towel and a bowl  --   --  ABE Run , SARAH  --  quick  --   --  SARAH Running to cabin .

There 's no doctor in thirty miles  --   --  You 've been the doctor and nurse  --  mother and father to ' em all . And when they die , you go into the woods , cut down a tree , rip out the boards , make the coffin , dig the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to cuss you , Tom Lincoln  --  but I ca n't  --  damn ye  --   --  ! TOM I 'm sorry , Doctor  --  but I just could n't let ye bleed her  --   --  DOCTOR All right  --  good-by  --   --  With a snort of anger , the DOCTOR throws his lancet into his saddle-bags , snaps them together , and starts for the gate .

DOCTOR I 'd stay and do something if I could , Sonny , but to tell ye the truth , I do n't know what to do  --  I 'm not quite sure I 'm right about the bleedin ' , or I 'd stay and make you both help me  --   --  He pauses . But I 'm not sure  --   --  ! I 'm not sure ! And I do n't know what else to do  --  I 've got no medicine  --  so I ca n't stay . All I can tell ye is to keep her warm  --  and give her everything good to eat that she can take  --  she 's in God 's hands  --  Good-by  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABE and TOM gazing forlornly after him , as SARAH comes from the house .

TOM Yes  --   --  NANCY enters by door of cabin . NANCY 'S sudden appearance in the door swings ABE around with a quick cry of pain . The sun is tinging the eastern sky with the splendor of an Indian Summer morning . The mother 's figure in blue homespun suggests against the dark background of the cabin door the coming of a spirit from the unseen world . She pauses a moment in the doorway and smiles at her son . ABE Oh , Ma , you must n't  --   --  TOM Following . Nancy  --   --  ! NANCY I 'm better , I 'm a lot better  --   --  ABE You 're too sick to come out here , Ma  --   --  NANCY Smiling .

ABE But the Doctor says you must keep warm  --   --  NANCY Well  --  I have on the warm stockings that Sarah knit for me and the coon skin moccasins you made  --  do n't you see , I 'm better now  --   --  ? ABE Joyfully . Look , Pa , she 's better ! SARAH Yes  --  she 's better ! TOM Alarmed . Do n't try to walk  --  set down , honey ! NANCY Sinking on bench . Yes  --  I will  --   --  The boy comes closer , staring eagerly into his mother 's face . NANCY Come closer , my boy  --   --  ABE kneels at her feet . TOM I 'm a feared of this , Nancy  --  you better let me git a hot rock and wrap it up for your feet . NANCY Yes , Tom  --  and bring me the Bible . I want Abe to read to me . TOM goes into the cabin worried over her . ABE Feel all right , Ma  --   --  ? NANCY She nods and breathes deeply  --  her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the trees ! You remember the day you cut down your first tree to begin the clearing and the sunlight came through the hole you 'd made to the sky  --   --  ABE Yes  --  I remember . NANCY You called me to come and see it  --   --  ABE In a whisper . Yes  --   --  NANCY I was proud that morning as I saw you stand with your ax on that big log  --  anything my boy starts to do  --  he does  --   --  Pauses . Your father taught you to use the ax and  --   --  Turns and looks at ABE . Your father 's a good man , my son  --  kind-hearted and true and everybody likes him . They made him road supervisor of his township in Kentucky once . If he could read and write he would have gone to the legislature  --   --  TOM enters from the cabin with the rock and Bible , he crosses to NANCY , and ABE takes the rock and puts it under her feet  --  SARAH kneels and helps him . NANCY 'S hand drops on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill of it worries him . ABE and SARAH rise . NANCY Read to me , son  --  I like to hear your voice  --   --  ABE Brightly . All right  --  what  --   --  ? NANCY The Twenty-third Psalm . ABE looks for the place . I love to hear you read , my boy . It means that you can do what any other man can  --  it means so much ! ABE Reads . The Lord is my shepherd  --  I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . He leadeth me beside still waters . He restoreth my soul . He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake  --   --  NANCY In a whisper . Yea , tho ' I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for thou art with me  --   --  ABE stops , looks up at his mother in amazement . ABE Ma  --   --  NANCY Remember always , my boy , that God is with you ! He is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wind , the trees and the grass  --  and not a sparrow falls to the ground without He knows . You recollect the year you put up those gourds there  --   --  She points to the pole. for your martins  --   --  ? You cried when they circled away in the fall  --   --  ABE nods . I told you God would send them back in the spring , did n't I  --   --  ? She laughs softly . You said that He 'd forget to tell them and they 'd never find the way  --  but they came  --  did n't they  --   --  ? ABE Yes , Ma , and I know now they 'll come again next spring . NANCY So  --  I want you never again to doubt God , my boy , and I want you never to doubt yourself . Your bare feet , your ragged clothes , how poor you are  --  this is nothing ! It does n't count here  --  it 's what you feel , it 's what you believe  --  it 's what you see that counts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you can do anything ! If God takes me  --   --  She pauses exhausted . ABE But you must n't say that , Ma  --   --  ! NANCY " The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether ! " ABE No ! no , Ma ! Do n't talk that way ! You 'll give up if you do  --   --  ! NANCY If He calls , my son , then my work is done  --  and you can do all I 've tried and failed to do  --   --  ABE Alarmed . Had she better talk so much , Pa  --   --  Stoops to fix her feet . TOM Feeling her hand . Nancy  --   --  ! NANCY Just a minute more , Tom  --   --  ! Do n't let him know yet  --  you know  --   --  ! TOM With upward look of faith . Yes , I know  --   --  To ABE . It 's all right  --  boy  --   --  NANCY Come back close , my son , I want to tell you something I saw last night ! I had a dream  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . You had grown a man  --  strong and brave  --  wise and gentle . The people hung on your words , and did you homage . But you remembered this cabin here in the deep woods and you were humble . I walked with you between two white pillars . It was still and solemn , in there . Outside I could hear the people calling your name . You bowed low and whispered in my ear : " This is all yours , my Mother . I bought it for you with my life . All that I am I owe to you  --   --  " Her voice sinks to a whisper that is half a laugh of religious ecstasy . ABE Joyfully . See how she 's smilin '  --  Pa ! She 's getting well  --  I tell you  --   --  ! TOM Whispering . Do n't ye understand , boy  --   --  ? ABE No  --  what  --   --  ? SARAH What  --  what is it  --   --  ? TOM In deep religious awe .

TOM It 's death  --  boy  --  it 's come  --  Lord , God , have mercy  --   --  ABE springs to his feet and stares in anguish , as TOM falls on his knees beside NANCY . NANCY 'S hand rests gently on TOM 'S shaggy head , while he sobs . With her other hand she feels for ABE 'S and holds it feebly . NANCY Be good to your Father ,  --   --  She pauses and breathes with difficulty . In the days to come , he will be the child and you the man  --   --  ABE Yes  --   --  NANCY And love your sister  --   --  ABE nods . If dark hours come , my spirit will be watching , my son  --  and I 'll help you if I can  --   --  ABE Yes , I know it ! NANCY And remember that you can be a great man in this free country if you only say  --  I will  --   --  NANCY 'S body sinks in death as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great purpose .

LINCOLN Make the appointment later . They 're all distinguished men . They can wait while the humbler people have their turn . I came up here from the wilderness . I know what it means to have the great rush by me  --   --  Laughs . No  --  I 'll see the common folks first  --   --  NICOLAY I think you 'd better see this Committee right away , sir  --   --  LINCOLN Why  --   --  ? What have you heard  --   --  ?

I 'll take my bath of public opinion first . I want to see real men and women and feel their hearts beat close to mine . It tones me up for the day 's work  --  let them in . STANTON bursts into the room in a towering rage . STANTON Mr. President , I 've been kept waiting ! Confronting NICOLAY . NICOLAY turns away and laughs . Nicolay ! How dare you keep me waiting in an anteroom , while you talk to the President ! I want you to understand , sir , that as Secretary of War , I 've the right to enter this room at any hour , day or night , announced or unannounced , and by God , I 'm going to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughing . Well , you 're here now , and it 's all right , Stanton  --  Easy ! Easy , or we 'll have to put some rocks in your pocket to hold you down . What can I do  --   --  ? STANTON Mr. President , I 've come here this morning to make a square issue with you on the abuse of the pardoning power which you are making daily  --   --  LINCOLN As Chief Magistrate of the people , I have been clothed with that power , Stanton  --   --  STANTON Angrily . You have no right to exercise it under the present conditions ! Discipline in our armies must be maintained . You are hamstringing me and every General in the field  --  by suspending the death penalty of our Courts-Martial . Men are deserting in thousands and we 've got to put a stop to it . LINCOLN That 's what I say  --   --  ! Bring to me the traitors who are causing them to desert , and see what I 'll do to them ! STANTON You ca n't evade the issue I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to pardon a deserter . I call a halt here and now  --  will you stop to-day the use of this pardoning power  --   --  ? LINCOLN I 've got to hear both sides  --  it 's my solemn duty  --   --  STANTON All right , I 'm done . There 's my resignation as your Secretary of War  --  Good-by ! STANTON strides angrily to the door and LINCOLN speaks as he puts his hand on the knob . LINCOLN Wait a minute  --   --  STANTON It 's no use  --   --  LINCOLN Come back here . I 've something to say to you . STANTON returns . STANTON You 're wasting your breath  --   --  LINCOLN Stanton , I appointed you Secretary of War against the advice of every man about me . You were a cantankerous Democrat and my enemy . You had said the meanest things about me that were ever spoken in Washington  --  and that 's putting it pretty strong . You called me a low clown  --  the original gorilla . In spite of all this , I saw your great qualities ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that your nerves were made of steel and your capacity for work was boundless . Even in your passions and hatreds , you showed a loyalty to the Union that rose above the parties and creeds of a lifetime . I like men of your strong personality . They stand between a nation and hell . And so , I appointed you , my bitter foe , to my cabinet . I 've never regretted it for a minute in these years of blood and anguish . You 've made the best Secretary of War this country ever had . In spite of your mean traits and your awful profanity , I 've learned to love you ! Now , you 've resigned , and done your duty , as you see it . I 've accepted your resignation , conscripted you again , and reappointed you  --   --  ! Pauses and strokes his shoulder .

LINCOLN Easy  --  easy now ! You 'll know they 're very urgent , and will admit of no delay on account of red tape  --   --  STANTON Throws his hands up in wild gesture of despair . Oh , my God ! STANTON exits . LINCOLN John , the old Fox was trying to head me off , was n't he  --   --  ? Get them in here quick  --  who 's the first in turn  --   --  ? NICOLAY A young lady to plead for the life of her brother  --   --  LINCOLN Bring her in ! As NICOLAY goes to the door , LINCOLN follows to meet the young woman . She enters , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is plainly dressed in homespun cloth and does not wear hoopskirts . The President greets her with the utmost deference . Taking both her hands .

THE SISTER Seizing the pardon . Wiz all my heart ! LINCOLN To NICOLAY . Send her to Stanton , and tell him to rush that order to stay the execution . They shall not shoot this poor boy , ignorant of our laws , but if he can find the man who put that little book  --   --  Holds up book. into his hand , advising desertion  --  I 'll hang him on a gallows forty cubits high ! He lays the booklet on his desk . NICOLAY writes on the back of the pardon . THE SISTER Joyfully .

I demand the right to see you  --  to ask the pardon of one of my constituents . LINCOLN All right ! Out with it ! CONGRESSMAN He is one of the solid citizens of Massachusetts ; a slave trader whose ship has been confiscated . He has spent five years in prison , and can not pay the heavy fine in money imposed  --   --  He is not a bad man at heart . LINCOLN And he wants me to pardon him  --  this slave-trader  --   --  ! CONGRESSMAN I ask it as a matter of justice  --  he has paid the penalty  --  five long years in prison  --   --  LINCOLN Laughs . I might pardon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this war  --  but a man who can make a business of going to Africa and robbing her of helpless men , women and children and selling them into bondage  --   --  ! He pauses and stiffens.  --  before that man can have liberty by any act of mine , he can stay in jail and rot ! NICOLAY To the Congressman . Now , you 've got it  --   --  ! CONGRESSMAN Crestfallen . Yes  --  I heard it  --   --  LINCOLN Turning back to his desk , and examining his papers . Good  --   --  Bring in the next one , John ! As NICOLAY exits with the Congressman who continues to talk in loud tones , a sweet little girl of twelve slips by and reaches the President 's desk unannounced . The President has taken his seat and is writing . While the President continues to write , the little girl slips close and watches him wistfully . He lifts his head , sees her , and smiles . Why , what a wee girl  --  and you got in here all by yourself  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  LINCOLN Did you ? What did you do that for ? VIRGINIA I was afraid they would n't let me in , if they knew what I wanted  --   --  LINCOLN Tenderly . And what do you want ? VIRGINIA If you please , sir  --  a pass to go through the lines to Virginia  --  my brother 's there  --  he was shot in the last battle  --  and I want to see him . LINCOLN Of course , you do  --  and you shall too . He seizes his pen , writes a pass and hands it to her . VIRGINIA Breathlessly . Oh , thank you  --  thank you ! LINCOLN Casually placing his hand on her head . Of course , you 're loyal  --   --  ? VIRGINIA 'S lips quiver , she hesitates , looks up into his face through dimmed eyes , and her slender body stiffens as she slowly speaks . VIRGINIA Yes  --  loyal  --  with all my heart  --  to Virginia ! The trembling little fingers hand the pass back as the tears roll down her cheeks . LINCOLN looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes her hand in his . His voice is low and tender and full of feeling . LINCOLN I know what it cost you to say that , child . You 're a brave little girl ! And I 'll love you always for this glimpse you 've given me of a great spirit and a great people . That 's why I ca n't let the South go  --   --  They ca n't leave this Union . We need them  --   --  Now I can trust you  --   --  ? VIRGINIA Eagerly . Yes , sir ! NICOLAY enters with a young mother and baby and hesitates at sight of the little girl . LINCOLN Come on in , John  --  it 's all right . I 'm about through with this young lady  --   --  NICOLAY brings the young mother to the desk and LINCOLN takes VIRGINIA down stage . Come down here , dear , so old man Nicolay ca n't hear us  --  he might n't understand . He sits on a chair and draws the girl close . You see , I understand you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back this and let you go  --  will you promise me that no word shall pass your lips of what you 've seen inside our lines ? VIRGINIA Oh , yes  --  I promise  --   --  ! LINCOLN Handing her the pass . May God speed the day , child , when your people and mine shall no longer be enemies  --   --  VIRGINIA Thank you , sir ! LINCOLN Run now ! VIRGINIA exits . At the door she throws him a kiss . LINCOLN comes quickly to the mother and greets her cheerily . Well , little mother , what 's the matter ? She hesitates and appeals to NICOLAY . NICOLAY Tell him yourself  --   --  THE MOTHER Trembling . If you please , sir , we ai n't been married but a little over a year , and my husband 's never seen the baby  --   --  LINCOLN That 's too bad  --   --  THE MOTHER He 's in the army and I could n't stand it any longer  --  so I came down to Washington to get a pass to take the baby to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Office  --   --  LINCOLN Laughs . I 'll bet old Mars would n't  --  Phew ! Pauses and turns to NICOLAY . What do you say . John  --  let 's send her down ? NICOLAY The strictest orders have been issued to allow no more women to go to the front  --   --  LINCOLN Humph  --   --  ! Well , I 'll tell you what we can do  --  give her husband a leave of absence , and let him come up here to see them ! THE MOTHER Laughing and crying . You do n't mind my laughing , do you ? I just ca n't help it  --  I ca n't stop ! I ca n't stop laughing ! LINCOLN Laugh and cry as much as you please  --  but tell me where are you stopping ? THE MOTHER Nowhere yet , sir  --   --  LINCOLN How 's that ? THE MOTHER I went straight from the depot to the War Office and then I just walked the street blind with crying till I made up my mind to come here . LINCOLN We 'll fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take you and your baby to a good hospital and care for you till your husband comes  --  and fix it so he can stay here a week with you  --   --  THE MOTHER Laughs . I just ca n't thank you ! I 'm so happy , all I can do is to laugh ! LINCOLN Laugh on , little mother  --  and off with you now  --  clear out ! The mother goes out laughing . NICOLAY shows the little mother out and returns to LINCOLN . NICOLAY The deputation of colored men whom you asked to come this morning are waiting , sir  --  will you see them now ? LINCOLN At once  --   --  LINCOLN turns to his desk and takes up a document containing his plan of Colonization and examines it as NICOLAY and three well-dressed colored men enter . They are typical Africans . FIRST NEGRO Bowing deferentially . Mr. President  --   --  ! SECOND NEGRO Tenderly . Our Father Abraham  --   --  THIRD NEGRO With religious feeling . We salute our Savior ! LINCOLN Welcome , my friends . I have sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my plan for colonization and to ask your help  --   --  FIRST NEGRO Yes , sir  --   --  The ebony faces with their cream white teeth showing in smiles and their wide rolling eyes make a striking contrast to the rugged face and poise of the President . LINCOLN Your race is suffering , in my judgment , the greatest wrong inflicted on any people . But even when you cease to be slaves , you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race . On this broad continent , not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours  --   --  FIRST NEGRO It 's so  --  yes , it 's so  --   --  ! LINCOLN Go where you are treated best and the ban is still upon you . I can not alter it if I would . It is better for us both , therefore , to be separated . For the sake of your people you should sacrifice something of your present comfort . FIRST NEGRO Let our great leader show us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one , and it is open to you . I am now arranging to open another in Central America . You are intelligent and know that success does not so much depend on external help as on self-reliance . If you will engage in the enterprise I will spend the money Congress has entrusted to me for this purpose . I ask you to consider it seriously , not for yourselves merely , nor for your race and ours for the present time , BUT FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND . FIRST NEGRO We will , sir  --   --  ! LINCOLN The practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of able-bodied men with their wives and children to go at once  --  men who " can cut their own fodder " so to speak  --   --  ? Take this plan , show it to your people  --   --  Hands the document to the First Negro.  --  and find this out for me  --   --  FIRST NEGRO We 'll do our best  --   --  THIRD NEGRO Bowing out with religious ecstasy . Praise God forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Negroes and shows in a stately black-robed figure in mourning for her dead . She walks quietly to the President and extends her hand with a gracious smile . THE WOMAN Perhaps I 've done wrong to take up your time  --   --  LINCOLN My time belongs to the people , Madam  --   --  THE WOMAN I 've come to you , Mr. President , under an impulse I could not resist . Mr. Stoddard , your third Secretary , is my friend . He told me this morning that all night the sound of your footfall came from this room . He heard it at nine , at ten , at eleven . At midnight the Secretary of War left the door ajar and the steady tramp came with heavier sound . The last thing he heard at three was the muffled beat upstairs . The guard said it had not stopped at daylight . I saw you staggering alone under a Nation 's sorrow and I wondered if you had been given the vision to see the dawn of a new life for our people . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word can stop this war and divide the Union  --  I have come to tell you that I lost my first born son at Fredericksburg  --  a lad of twenty  --   --  She pauses and LINCOLN bends and presses her hand . May God help you in your trials , Mr. President , as he has helped me in mine  --   --  LINCOLN Startled . You lost your first born at Fredericksburg and come to say this to me ? THE WOMAN And I 've been praying for you , day and night since  --   --  LINCOLN Softly . Will you say that again , Madam  --   --  THE WOMAN I have been praying for you , day and night , and I 've come this morning to bring you this message  --  Be strong and courageous , and God will bring the Nation through ! LINCOLN You say this to me  --  standing beside the grave of your son ? THE WOMAN And beside the cot of my other boy of sixteen who was dangerously wounded in General Grant 's last battle . I am proud of two such sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tell you that I 'm praying for you . LINCOLN closes both hands over hers and holds them a moment in silence . LINCOLN With upward gaze . How strange that you should come to me in this black hour with such a message . I 've often wondered if the soul of my mother were not speaking to me ! The day she died in the woods of Indiana , she told me that if dark hours came , her spirit would be watching , and she 'd help me if she could ! While you were talking to me  --  I got the tremor of her voice and the quiver of her lips  --  how strange ! Looking down into her face . Thank you , Madam ! You have brought me medicine for both body and soul . LINCOLN presses her hand again and she quietly goes as he gazes after her . NICOLAY starts to follow her to the door  --  LINCOLN lifts his hand . John , I 'm rested now  --  I 'm ready for any work  --   --  ! NICOLAY The National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  let them in ! LINCOLN resumes his place beside his desk and the Committee headed by HENRY RAYMOND , Editor of the New York Times , enter and solemnly range themselves about the President . To HENRY RAYMOND  --  taking his hand formally . Raymond , this is an unexpected honor you and your Committee do me . I thought you were at your desk in the Times office pouring hot shot into the flanks of our enemies , and the boys were all at home fighting for the victory that must be ours on the first Tuesday in November . Not that you 're unwelcome . You are the leaders of public opinion . The people rule this country , and I am their servant  --  what is it  --   --  ? RAYMOND You may be sure , Mr. President , that our mission is of the gravest importance . These gentlemen have brought such startling reports from their several states as to the bitterness and closeness of the fight , that they have reached a unanimous conclusion  --   --  LINCOLN And that is  --   --  ? RAYMOND That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Democratic opponent  --  the election for us is lost . LINCOLN Your statement is blunt . But , as I have been renominated for a second term , my administration has been endorsed by our party , and the election is only eight weeks off  --  there is but one conclusion possible  --  and that is , that you should roll up your sleeves and get to work . RAYMOND The National Committee , Mr. President , has reached a different conclusion  --   --  LINCOLN Yes  --   --  ? RAYMOND In view of your unpopularity , in view of the criticism of your policies , and your conduct of the war  --  they have decided to ask you to withdraw from the ticket and permit them to name a new candidate  --   --  LINCOLN Springing to his feet . What  --   --  ! RAYMOND I have stated it bluntly  --   --  LINCOLN And this is your unanimous verdict , gentlemen  --   --  ? ALL Yes . LINCOLN Paces the floor a moment and then faces the Committee . It surpasses human belief ! Future generations will hold it incredible  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult upon the man who led you to your first and only victory . That you should come here to-day to ask me to quit under fire , to sacrifice without a blow all I hold worth fighting for on this earth  --   --  ! RAYMOND The Committee made their request solely on the ground of patriotic duty  --  and ask you for the sacrifice upon the same grounds . They have found it impossible to defend your policies  --   --  LINCOLN Brusquely . What policies ? RAYMOND Understand me , Mr. President  --  I am telling you the conclusion of this Committee  --   --  LINCOLN All right , Raymond  --  fire away  --  spare me the oratory , please  --  just give me the plain reasons , one at a time , why you wish me to get off the ticket  --   --  RAYMOND The first policy found indefensible has been your handling of the border slave states of Maryland , Kentucky and Missouri . You have not yet declared the slaves free in these states , the only ones in which you actually have the power to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration has been to save for the Union the great border states  --  for the simple reason  --  with these border slave states , we have such a balance of power that the Union may be saved ! Without these states , the Union can not be saved ! Therefore in my Proclamation of Emancipation , I purposely did not raise the question of the right or wrong of slavery . If slavery is not wrong , nothing is wrong . But the Constitution of the United States , which I have sworn to uphold in the border states of Maryland , Kentucky and Missouri , guarantees to their people the right to hold slaves if they choose . RAYMOND But why pat on the back the slaveholder of Maryland and strike at the slaveholder of South Carolina ? LINCOLN Because Maryland is loyal to the Union , and South Carolina is fighting it . My Proclamation was not a sermon on the rights of man  --  black or white . It was an act of war  --  a blow aimed at the heart of the seceding South to break its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union . I know the spell of State loyalty in the South , gentlemen . I was born there . Many a mother in Richmond wept the day our flag fell from their Capitol . But they brushed their tears away and sent their sons to the front the next day , to fight that flag  --  in the name of Virginia ! So would thousands of mothers in these border slave states , if I put them to the test . In God 's own time slavery will be destroyed . I have saved these states for our cause by conciliation and compromise . I will not apologize for this act . He lifts his hand to stop interruption . My paramount object is to save the Union , and not , either to save or destroy slavery . If I could save the Union , without freeing a slave , I would do it . And if I could save it by freeing all the slaves , I would do it . And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored race , I do because I believe it helps to save this Union ! Pauses and faces his accusers . I 'll test this question right here  --  will the three Committeemen from Kentucky , Missouri and Maryland stand up for a minute ? The three Committeemen rise . Will the gentleman from Kentucky tell me what would have been the effect if I had included his state in my proclamation freeing the slaves  --   --  ? THE KENTUCKY COMMITTEEMAN The state would have seceded from the Union , sir . LINCOLN Just so , and in Missouri ? THE MISSOURI COMMITTEEMAN The Legislature would have joined the Confederacy within twenty-four hours . LINCOLN And Maryland  --   --  ? THE MARYLAND COMMITTEEMAN Maryland would have promptly cut the railroads leading into Washington , isolated the Capital and joined the South . LINCOLN And with the loss of our Capital , Europe , eager to strike , would have recognized the Confederacy , would they not ? THE MARYLAND COMMITTEEMAN Undoubtedly , sir  --   --  LINCOLN So I hold  --   --  THE MARYLAND COMMITTEEMAN Our State believed you when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists ! " LINCOLN Then you three gentlemen , at least , are with me on this issue ? ALL THREE Yes  --  ! Yes  --  ! Yes  --  ! LINCOLN I thought so  --   --  To Raymond . What next ? RAYMOND Your plan to colonize the Negro race as expressed in your Proclamation of Emancipation and in the bill which you have had passed through Congress has hurt your best friends  --   --  LINCOLN And why should it ? My views on that subject were known to all men before you nominated me first in Chicago , four years ago . I said then that I believed there is a sharp physical difference between the white and black races , and I have always linked colonization with freedom . The Negro can not remain in a free democracy unless we absorb him into our social and political life . Therefore , we must colonize him . We owe it to ourselves , we owe it to future generations  --  above all , we owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cruel force . At our own expense , therefore , we should return him to the home of his fathers , and build there a free republic for his children . We should give him our language and our ideals , and we should give him millions of our money , until he can stand alone . We must face this problem squarely now . RAYMOND Yet you compromise on other issues . LINCOLN Only because I must to save the Union . Trim and hedge on this issue , and future generations will feel their way back to it through blood and tears . I have always held that the happiness and progress of this Union of Free Democratic States will be secure only in the separation of the white and black races , and I will not eat my words !  --   --  Pauses.  --  the next charge in your bill of indictment , gentlemen ? RAYMOND I now present the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens , leader of Congress , the representative of the radical wing of our party , who have split our organization by nominating another candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEVENS Pompously to the Committee . The radical wing of the party , gentlemen , has been the only creative force within it  --  and is the only thing that gives it an excuse for being to-day . LINCOLN Firmly . Which means that you think that I am superfluous and always have been  --  I thank you  --  proceed ! STEVENS We denounce first your policy of reconstruction in the South as weak and vacillating  --  a civil and military failure . As the army advances , the South should be held as conquered soil , its civilization torn up by the roots , the property of the Southern white people confiscated and given to the negroes . The ballot must be taken from the whites and given to their slaves . We demand this just vengeance and we will be content with nothing less ! LINCOLN Stevens , I greet with shame your demands ! Surely the vastness of this war , its grim battles , its heroism , its anguish , its sublime earnestness , should sink all schemes of revenge . Before the grandeur of its simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil ! The South has never been out of this Union . Secession was null and void from the beginning . I say to the South now , as I have always said : " Come back home ! You can have peace at any moment , by simply laying down your arms and submitting to the National Authority . " When the South lies crushed at our feet , God 's vengeance shall be enough . STEVENS The life of our party , sir , demands that the Negro be given the ballot and made the ruler of the South . This is not vengeance . It is justice  --  it is patriotism . LINCOLN The Nation can not be healed until the South is healed . Let the gulf be closed in which we bury strifes and hatreds . The good sense of our people will never consent to your scheme of vengeance . STEVENS The people have no sense ! And a new fool is born every second . LINCOLN I have an abiding faith in their honesty and good purpose . I have trusted the people before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  ! LINCOLN I ca n't tell you , Stevens , how your venomous plans sicken me . I 'd rather work with you than fight you , if it 's possible . But the line is drawn now  --  we 've got to fight  --  and I 'm not afraid of you . STEVENS You had better listen  --   --  LINCOLN I 'll suffer my right arm to be severed from my body before I 'll sign one measure of revenge on a brave , fallen foe ! STEVENS I have always known you had a sneaking admiration for the South ! LINCOLN I love the South  --  it is a part of this Union ! And when the curse of slavery is lifted , it should be the garden spot of the world  --  I love every foot of its soil  --  every hill and valley , and every man , woman and child in it . I am an American ! STEVENS The kind of an American that makes the election of your opponent , General George B. McClellan , a certainty  --   --  LINCOLN Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAYMOND and STEVENS , and dead silence follows . Come on  --  out with his name  --   --  ! They remain silent . You ca n't name him ? Let me try to nominate him for you  --   --  On a platform of proscription and revenge , the hanging of rebel leaders , the confiscation of the property of the white people of the South and its bestowment upon the negroes , the taking of the ballot from the whites and setting their slaves to rule over them  --  on this program I resign as your candidate and nominate for President , the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens  --   --  THE COMMITTEE In a wild uproar . No ! No ! No ! Not by a damn sight ! To hell with Stevens ! LINCOLN quietly laughs and STEVENS angrily lifts his hand to quiet them . STEVENS Now that you 've had your joke  --  let me remind you that the radical wing of the Republican Party has already named General John C. Fremont against you  --   --  LINCOLN To the Committee . What say you , gentlemen  --   --  ? Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictate to you your platform and your candidate before your convention met ? Do you ask me to resign in favor of General Fremont ? THE COMMITTEE No ! No ! Down with the bolter ! To the devil with Fremont . No ! No ! No ! Damnation  --  no  --   --  RAYMOND quiets the uproar . STEVENS I am not asking you to nominate Fremont . We split the party and named Fremont because we would n't have you . Get off the ticket and we will withdraw Fremont and put up a man who can be elected ! Whatever the chances of General Fremont at this moment the election of McClellan on a Democratic Copperhead Platform is conceded by your own party councils . McClellan is even now choosing his Cabinet  --   --  LINCOLN They say it is not wise to count chickens before they 're hatched  --  we still have our chance ! STEVENS You have no chance ! You have already been weighed and found wanting ! In the Congressional election , what happened ?  --  your majorities were wiped out . Maine cut you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indiana deserted us . In Pennsylvania even , we lost by four thousand . New York elected Horatio Seymour against us . New Jersey turned you down . Wisconsin was a tie . In your own state of Illinois , the Democrats won by seventeen thousand  --   --  ! LINCOLN Even so , Stevens  --  the ballots in this election have not yet been counted ! My faith in the ultimate good sense of the people is unshaken . You can fool some of the people all the time . You can fool all of the people sometimes . But you ca n't fool all the people all the time ! STEVENS That 's why we ask you to get off the ticket ! You are to-day the most unpopular man who ever sat in the Presidential chair . For the first time in our history the effigy of a living President  --  your effigy  --  has been publicly burned in the streets of American towns and cities , amid the curses and jeers of the men who elected you ! Your administration is a failure  --  your conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example  --   --  STEVENS Furiously . For one thing  --  you have never yet chosen a successful General . The South has not changed Commanders since Jeff Davis appointed Robert E. Lee . In thirty days of the last campaign in a series of massacres , Lee has killed and wounded sixty-two thousand of our men  --  more than he himself commanded  --  and Grant has only reached the point where McClellan stood in 1862 . He could have marched there by McClellan 's old line without the loss of a man . Washington is piled with the wounded , the dying and the dead . Your mail is choked with letters demanding the removal of this butcher as our Commander , and you refuse  --  why ? LINCOLN Smiling calmly . Well , now that you 've really let off steam , I think you 'll feel better , Stevens  --   --  ! STEVENS I demand , sir , an answer to my question  --  why have you not removed Grant ? LINCOLN Quickly . Because I ca n't spare him ! He is the one General we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to reach any particular spot where McClellan stood . McClellan was generally standing somewhere  --  he was a great engineer  --  of the stationary type  --   --  Grant is a fighter . His business is to find and destroy Lee 's army  --  and his sledge hammer blows are winning this war ! STEVENS Winning  --  is he ? And yet Lee sends a division under Jubal Early and reconquers the Valley of Virginia  --  invades Maryland and Pennsylvania , throws his shells into Washington and burns the home of one of your Cabinet  --   --  LINCOLN And if old Jubal Early had been a little earlier , he would have burned Washington , too  --  but thank God , Grant got here in time  --  did n't he ? What have you got to say to that ? STEVENS That Lee 's strategy has been superb , his moral victory complete ! He holds Grant by the throat while he invades the North , and shells our Capitol  --  a feat that not one of your generals has yet done for Richmond in four years  --  and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , I 'm going to talk plain English to you , Stevens . You 're an Abolitionist , and you ca n't do Grant justice . Your crowd demanded his removal after the battle of Shiloh  --  and you made it so hot for me then , I had to appoint General Halleck his superior , to save him for the country . You ca n't forget that Grant is a Democrat , and therefore he may vote for McClellan against our party , in this election ! STEVENS I 've heard that he is for McClellan . LINCOLN Exactly ! And you ca n't forget that his wife is a Southern woman whose dowry was in Slaves , and therefore at this moment , Grant is constructively a slaveholder , whose slaves I have not freed  --   --  STEVENS I protest  --   --  LINCOLN It 's no use  --  I know the process of your mind  --  I can see the wheels go round inside ! You tell me that the star of Grant has set in a welter of blood before Lee 's army . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the witnesses of our agony . I know that every city , town and village is in mourning . From these stricken homes there has arisen a storm of protest against the new leader of the army . The word butcher is bandied from lip to lip . They tell me that Grant is merely a bulldog fighter  --  that he can win only as long as thousands are poured into his ranks to take the place of the dead  --  They tell me that he has no genius , no strategy , no skill . My reply to this is simple but unanswerable . We must fight to win . Grant is the ablest general we have developed . His losses are appalling  --  but the struggle is on now to the bitter end ! Our resources are exhaustless . The South can not replace her fallen soldiers  --  and therefore her losses are fatal ! If we continue to fight , five millions can not whip twenty millions  --  the end is certain  --  and we 're now locked in the last death grapple before  --  VICTORY ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ! LINCOLN I 've thought so from the first , but I 've tried to be polite  --   --  STEVENS Trying to go . Good day , sir  --   --  ! LINCOLN Cordially . Good day , Stevens  --   --  Pauses . You know this meeting reminds me of what happened in Illinois once  --   --  STEVENS Throwing up his hands in anger . I wo n't hear it , sir ! You and your stories are sending this country to hell  --  it 's not more than a mile from there now ! LINCOLN I believe it is just a mile from here to the Capitol where you sit ! STEVENS Going in rage . Damnation ! STEVENS goes muttering furiously . RAYMOND You will consider our request , Mr. President ? LINCOLN Raymond , this is the most brutal insult ever offered to a man in my position in the history of this country . I 'm going to waive the insult and give your request my earnest thought . If I can save the Union  --  that 's the only question  --  that 's the only question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINCOLN Firmly . No . I must have time to think . As I 've listened to you , the conviction grows on me that the life of the Union may be bound with mine now , and I 'm not going to give up  --  without a fight . RAYMOND Brusquely . We can not leave Washington without your answer , Mr. President . LINCOLN You 'll get it in due time . RAYMOND The time is short  --   --  LINCOLN It may be long enough yet , to save the Nation  --   --  RAYMOND Firmly . The Committee must take definite action before we leave  --  we will give you ten days to decide  --   --  LINCOLN I understand . Good day , gentlemen ! ALL Bowing out . Good day , Mr. President . LINCOLN stands erect , with NICOLAY watching them go in silence . When the last man is gone , he turns to NICOLAY . LINCOLN It 's infamous , John ! Infamous ! MRS . LINCOLN enters hurriedly . Do n't tell her the nasty things old Thad said to me . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINCOLN Tensely . What is it , Father  --  what did they say ? He pauses and she presses him tremblingly . What did they say ? What did they say ? LINCOLN With dreamy look . They told me in plain English that I am the most unpopular man in the United States  --  that my conduct of the war is a series of blunders , my administration a failure ! MRS . LINCOLN Relieved . Oh !  --  is that all ! LINCOLN What more  --   --  ? MRS . LINCOLN I thought they had something important to tell you  --   --  LINCOLN Laughs . Oh !  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN That is of no importance , because it 's a lie  --   --  LINCOLN But , if they believe it , and millions of people believe it  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Well , they wo n't . I 've something important to ask of you  --  Betty Winter 's in my room and wants to bring her lover here to see you alone for an hour to-night  --   --  LINCOLN I 'll see Miss Betty Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it nine o'clock . MRS . LINCOLN Going . At nine  --  do n't forget now ! LINCOLN I 'll not  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN exits . John , is General McClellan at home ? NICOLAY I saw him to-day , sir . LINCOLN Go to his house immediately and tell him I want to see him here at eight o'clock to-night . Say that it 's a matter of the gravest importance  --  both to him and to the country  --  he ca n't refuse . NICOLAY Yes , sir . LINCOLN Say to General McClellan that I would come to him but for the fact that it would attract attention which I wish to avoid . It will be the best for both that this meeting should not be known . Ask him to come in a closed carriage . Assure him that you will meet him at the door and he will see no one but me  --   --  NICOLAY You ca n't take me into your confidence , Chief ? LINCOLN Pauses . Partly  --  I 'm going to put McClellan to the supreme test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Copperhead issue which I will ask of him , I 'll name for this Committee a candidate they 're not looking for  --  I 'll give them the surprise of their life  --  so help me God ! NICOLAY I do n't think the General will give that pledge , sir . LINCOLN Gazing upward and folding his arms . I wonder !  --  I wonder if he will ! NICOLAY exits . I wonder if he will  --   --  CURTAIN ACT II SET SCENE : The same as Act I at a quarter to eight the same evening . AT RISE : EDWARD , the old Doorman , is straightening the furniture in the room . He clumsily clears the floor of a litter of letters and places them in the corner with the unopened bag . He draws the heavy draperies of the windows and adjusts them so that no ray of light can reach the outside . MRS . LINCOLN enters and watches him fix the draperies . MRS . LINCOLN Speaking suddenly . Edward  --   --  ! EDWARD Jumping in fright . Yes , Madam ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here  --   --  ? EDWARD In terror of MRS . LINCOLN . Just  --  er drawin '  --  er the curtains , Madam . MRS . LINCOLN Sternly . These curtains have n't been drawn in a year  --   --  EDWARD Stammering . **30;4941;TOOLONG  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN You know they have n't ! EDWARD Gulping wind . Yes 'm  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Who told you to draw them ? EDWARD Colonel Nicolay ! MRS . LINCOLN Where is he ? EDWARD Down-stairs , on the door . MRS . LINCOLN In your place ? EDWARD Yes 'm  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN While you 're up here acting as house maid ? EDWARD Embarrassed . Well , so it seems , Madam  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Sternly . What does this mean ? EDWARD I do not know , Madam  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Sarcastically . And you have n't the slightest idea  --  I suppose ? EDWARD Not the slightest . My experience as Doorman of the White House has taught me that my first duty is to obey the orders of my Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain on duty here to-night ? EDWARD Bows . Asked me as a particular personal favor to him , that I remain on duty until eight o'clock and dismiss all the other White House attendants  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN The guard has been dismissed ! EDWARD Yes , Madam , both of them  --  inside and out . MRS . LINCOLN Ask Colonel Nicolay to come here  --   --  EDWARD Hesitates . Yes 'm  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Sharply . Quick ! EDWARD Jumps . Right away , Madam ! MRS . LINCOLN quickly examines the President 's desk , looking for a memorandum of his appointments  --  she finds a pad and reads . MRS . LINCOLN At eight o'clock  --   --   --   --  At nine o'clock  --  Miss Betty Winter  --   --  NICOLAY enters hurriedly . NICOLAY What is it , Madam ? MRS . LINCOLN Who has this mysterious appointment with the President at eight o'clock  --  the name is blank . NICOLAY I am forbidden to discuss it with any one . MRS . LINCOLN Angrily . Indeed ! NICOLAY I am sorry . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Do you know the subject for discussion at this meeting ? NICOLAY I wish to God I did  --   --  LINCOLN enters and glances at his wife in surprise . LINCOLN Will you go back to the door , John  --   --  NICOLAY At once  --  sir  --   --  LINCOLN And tell Edward I 'm much obliged to him for staying , but he can go now  --   --  NICOLAY Yes , sir  --   --  LINCOLN See that he goes before our visitor arrives . I have asked him to say nothing about this appointment . NICOLAY You can trust him implicitly , sir  --   --  NICOLAY exits . MRS . LINCOLN But , you ca n't trust your wife , to-night , it seems  --   --  LINCOLN Whimsically . Well , you know you 're a woman , Mother  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Angrily . Thank God  --   --  LINCOLN Amen ! So say I ! MRS . LINCOLN You 're afraid to tell me  --  who this man is  --   --  ? LINCOLN I may tell you to-morrow  --   --  MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mistake this time  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Then why are you afraid of my woman 's intuition  --   --  LINCOLN Smiling . I 'm not afraid of your intuition , Mother  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Thank you . LINCOLN I did n't say it !  --   --  Laughs.  --  But you know you do talk too much sometimes ! MRS . LINCOLN Angrily . And I 'm going to say something to you now . I thought this morning that you would treat those scoundrels with the contempt they deserve when they dared to ask you to sacrifice yourself and the cause of the Union to the ambitions of some traitor behind them . LINCOLN No ! No ! They 're honest in what they say  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Furious . You 're too good and simple for this world ! Do n't you know that some schemer is behind all this  --   --  ? LINCOLN Maybe  --   --  It 's not a crime , Mother , for a man to aspire to high office , if the bee 's in his bonnet . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  MRS . LINCOLN Do n't  --  do n't  --  do n't say such foolish things . You need a guardian . You kept three men in your Cabinet who used their position to try to climb into the Presidency over your head . And you did n't kick them out . LINCOLN The country needed them . MRS . LINCOLN With earnest dignity . The country needs you  --  you are the man , and the only man who has the simple common sense to save this Union first , and settle all other questions afterwards  --   --  LINCOLN That may be so  --  too  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN Tell me one thing  --  is the man who has this appointment at eight the traitor whom Raymond 's Committee is trying to put in your place  --   --  ? LINCOLN No ! Yet  --  if there is anywhere a better man who can render the country a greater service than I can , he ought to be in my place  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN But do n't you see that it is n't really the man who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherous fight ? It 's the liar and the hypocrite who may win . LINCOLN I have no right in such an hour to think of my own ambitions . My personal desire for a second term is the biggest thing in my life , God knows  --   --  He pauses as his voice breaks  --  he struggles a moment and lifts his hand as if to throw off an obsession with a determined smile . And yet , my personal desire is a petty thing ! My duty to-day is the biggest thing in the world ! MRS . LINCOLN You wo n't take my advice and send these men about their business ? LINCOLN Mary , I 've got to fight this thing out alone , with myself and God  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN I sometimes think , Father , that you 're the stubbornest man the Lord ever made ! LINCOLN I 've got to be  --  to do this job  --   --  MRS . LINCOLN exits . LINCOLN paces the floor with his arms locked behind him in tense thought . NICOLAY enters . NICOLAY The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear ? NICOLAY Yes . Edward has gone  --   --  He pauses . You , of course , realize , Chief , the importance of a cool head in dealing with McClellan  --   --  LINCOLN I wo n't lose my temper , John . NICOLAY McClellan may lose his  --   --  LINCOLN I 'll watch out  --   --  Looking over his desk . That report of Baker 's on the Copperhead Societies  --   --  NICOLAY Pointing . Under that paper weight , sir  --   --  LINCOLN Oh , yes , I see  --   --  Picks up report , glances at it , and lays it back on his desk . I 'm ready  --  bring him in . See that we are not interrupted , and when he goes , I 'll not need you any more to-night . I 'll let in the young people myself , at nine o'clock . NICOLAY Yes , sir . NICOLAY exits and LINCOLN returns to his desk and writes . NICOLAY enters with GENERAL MCCLELLAN . The General is thirty-eight years old , dressed in a uniform of immaculate cut , flashing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in striking contrast to the President , he is a man of commanding appearance , and gives one the impression of a born leader of men . He enters with quick military precision and salutes with studied formality the President as his superior officer . The President answers his salute , as NICOLAY exits . LINCOLN I suggest , General McClellan , that we forget for the moment that I am the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy  --  and we have a little heart to heart talk in a perfectly informal way  --   --  McCLELLAN Stiffening . May I enquire , Mr. President , at once , to what I owe this extraordinary summons ? LINCOLN Cordially . Will you be seated , General  --   --  ? McCLELLAN Thank you , I prefer to stand . Angrily . What right have you to send for me or ask anything , after the foul injustice with which you have treated me as Commanding General  --   --  LINCOLN Interrupting . Just a moment  --  I have not treated you with injustice  --  I have treated you with more than justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of a father for a wayward boy  --   --  McCLELLAN Really ! LINCOLN I have . When I appointed you to the chief command of our Army , you were but thirty-four years old . I did it against the bitterest opposition of my party leaders . They told me you were a pro-Slavery Democrat  --  a political meddler , and that you were opposed to me on every issue before the people . I refused to listen . I asked but one question : Is McClellan the man to whip the new army into a mighty fighting machine , and hurl it against the Confederacy ? I said to them : " I do n't care what his religion is , or his politics may be . The question is , not whether I shall save the Union  --  but that the Union shall be saved . My future and the future of my party can take care of themselves "  --  and I appointed you . McCLELLAN And forced me to march against Richmond before I was ready ! LINCOLN I ordered you to move , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 180,000 men had gone into winter quarters around a glittering camp over which a young Napoleon presided . Fools about you daily advised that you proclaim the end of the Republic and establish yourself as Dictator . You do not deny this  --   --  ? McCLELLAN No . The fact is well known . Besides , Stanton , your Secretary of War , was at that time my attorney , and he knew  --   --  LINCOLN Exactly . I took the bull by the horns and ordered your grand army to move on Richmond . When you failed and retreated , I refused to dismiss you against the fierce protest of my Cabinet . I left you in command of half our men and appointed General Pope to lead the other half . McCLELLAN Sneeringly . And he led them to overwhelming disaster at the second battle of Manassas  --   --  LINCOLN Quickly . For which disaster , you must share the blame . You were ordered to join Pope . You did n't move . Pope was broken by a deliberate design , that was little short of treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your trial by court martial , I did the most unpopular act of my life . I reappointed you to the chief command of the whole army  --  defied public opinion , and faced a storm of abuse in my party councils . McCLELLAN And when I led that superb , reorganized army to our first victory at Antietam , you removed me from my command before I could win my campaign . LINCOLN I removed you from your command because , after you had cut Lee 's army to pieces , and he had but 23,000 men left , and you had 75,000  --  three to one  --  you lay down on your arms and allowed Lee to escape across the river without a blow  --  while Jeb . Stuart with his cavalry once more insulted you by riding around your army . Come now , ca n't we leave to posterity to settle the merits of our controversy over the command of armies ? Ca n't you believe me to-day , when I tell you with God as my witness , that I have never allowed a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have made  --   --  ? McCLELLAN I can not believe it  --   --  LINCOLN In spite of the fact that when I reappointed you to the chief command of the army after the disaster to Pope , you thought that my messenger was an officer with a warrant for your arrest ! You still say no  --   --  ? McCLELLAN I still say no  --  you had to do it  --  and you know that you had to reappoint me . LINCOLN Well , I 'll not pretend that I did n't understand the seriousness of that hour . The Army was behind you , to a man ! I sounded the officers , I sounded the men . They were against me and with you . If the leaders had dared risk their necks on a revolution , they might have won and set up a Dictatorship ! McCLELLAN Just so ! LINCOLN This power over men which you possess , General McClellan , is a marvelous thing . It is a dangerous force . It can be used to create a Nation , or destroy one . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed you were the ablest General in sight , and I called you back to your high position . McCLELLAN With a smile . Very kind ! LINCOLN You had to win or lose at Antietam . If you had won I was vindicated , and your success would have been mine ! But when Lee 's army escaped , you lost the power over the imagination of your men , the threat of a Dictatorship had passed  --  the supremacy of the civil government was restored , and I removed you from command  --   --  McCLELLAN Angrily . I repeat that your act was one of foul injustice ! LINCOLN Cordially . All right then . I 've given you my side . Granted for the sake of argument that I have treated you unfairly , I 'm going to put you to a supreme test . I am going to propose , on a certain condition , to the man whom I have wronged , an amazing thing  --   --  McCLELLAN Hence the secrecy with which I am summoned ! LINCOLN Yes . I have just written out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and addressed to Henry Raymond , Chairman of our National Committee , my resignation as a Candidate for the Presidency for a second term  --  and I will give it to him to-night , if you will agree to take my place and save the Union ? McCLELLAN Overwhelmed with excitement . What-can-you-mean  --   --  ? LINCOLN Exactly what I 've said . McCLELLAN Paces the floor trembling . And your conditions  --   --  ? LINCOLN Very simple . Agree to preside to-morrow night at a great Democratic Union Mass Meeting in New York , and boldly put yourself at the head of that wing of your party which stands for the preservation of the Union  --   --  McCLELLAN And you  --   --  ? LINCOLN I will withdraw from the race , secure your endorsement , or prevent my party from naming a successor , take the stump for you and guarantee your election . McCLELLAN Studies LINCOLN a moment with suspicion . You are in earnest  --   --  ? LINCOLN I was never more so . McCLELLAN And there is no string to this offer ? LINCOLN On my word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to say that I came into this office with high ambitions to serve my country . My dream of glory may be at an end and I have left only the agony and the tears  --   --  He pauses , breathes deeply , and struggles with his emotions , recovers himself , and goes on wistfully . I did want a chance to stay here for another term to see the sun shine again , to heal my country 's wounds , and show all the people , North , South , East and West , that I love them . But I ca n't risk the chances of this election  --  if you and I can come to a perfect understanding , and you agree to take my place upon the solemn pledge to save the Union without division . I 've made up my mind to this , because I have on my desk here a report from our Secret Service  --   --  Pauses and picks up the report. showing that the Copperhead Societies are of your party and are thoroughly organized in every state of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a division of the Union  --   --  McCLELLAN Interrupting . What has this to do with me , may I ask  --   --  ? LINCOLN Evenly . This report shows that they propose to end the war on the night of the election by a revolutionary uprising which will result in the recognition of the Confederacy . I am now being urged to arrest their leaders . He pauses and watches McCLELLAN closely . I shall answer no . Let sleeping dogs lie . One revolution at a time . If the Union candidate wins the election , they wo n't dare to rise . If he loses , it 's all over anyhow  --  and it makes no difference what they do . McCLELLAN A sensible decision  --   --  LINCOLN I 'm glad you agree with it . Now the Democratic Convention meets in Chicago next week  --  you have no opposition . Your nomination will be unanimous . The question is ,  --  what will they do on the issue of the war ? The leaders of the Copperhead Societies are now in touch with the rebel government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir  --  even about Copperhead Societies  --   --  LINCOLN I have the proofs in this document  --   --  Touches BAKER 'S report . My fear is , that they may get complete control of your Convention  --   --  McCLELLAN Angrily . Indeed  --   --  ? LINCOLN I have heard the ugly rumor that they are counting on you  --   --  McCLELLAN Advancing . Stop  --   --  ! LINCOLN Going to meet McCLELLAN and holding his gaze firmly . Well  --   --  ? McCLELLAN No man can couple the word Treason with my name , sir  --   --  ! LINCOLN Have I done so  --   --  ? McCLELLAN You are insinuating it ! LINCOLN Am I ? McCLELLAN I demand a retraction ! LINCOLN Smiling . Then , I apologize for my careless expressions . I am glad to see you meet the ugly subject in this way ! I have never believed you a traitor to the Union . That 's why I sent for you to-night . Will you denounce these men publicly at a Union Mass Meeting , and let me resign and take the stump for you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election without your help , sir ! LINCOLN You ca n't be  --   --  McCLELLAN A straw vote was taken yesterday in the Carver Hospital . The wounded soldiers gave me three votes to your one . Straws show which way the wind is blowing . I know that your party is divided  --  that John C. Fremont has split your organization , and is daily gaining ground  --  that unless he retires , you ca n't be elected ! Your party is in a hopeless panic  --  and my election is conceded . Yet , you ask me allow you to dictate the policy of my administration ! LINCOLN Evenly and pressingly . Will you denounce these conspirators within your party  --   --  ? McCLELLAN No  --   --  ! When I need your advice on any public utterance , I 'll let you know . LINCOLN Will you preside over this Union Meeting ? McCLELLAN Firmly . Never ! I 'll do my best to save my country , but in my own way without suggestion or assistance from you  --   --  LINCOLN With firm conviction . Then , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of this Union ! I suspected it  --  but I had hoped for the best  --  good night ! The General bows stiffly and leaves the President standing in sorrowful silence , his deep eyes staring into space , seeing nothing as NICOLAY enters . Pausing , and looking up . I thought you 'd gone  --   --  ? NICOLAY I hope there may be something else I can do for you , sir  --   --  ? LINCOLN Yes  --  there is  --   --  NICOLAY What ? LINCOLN Bear witness with me to this , the blackest hour of my life  --  I have touched the depths of despair  --   --  Springs to his feet . But I ca n't give up  --  there 's too much at stake ! NICOLAY Corruption , intrigue and malice are doing their work , Chief  --  but you ca n't be beaten ! Unless you should give up ! LINCOLN Well ! I wo n't give up ! NICOLAY McClellan refused the pledge you asked ? LINCOLN Yes . He is bound hand and foot to the Copperhead leaders who will control his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , if I could win one man out of the inner councils of the Copperhead orders  --  one man who really loves his country  --   --  NICOLAY Can a Copperhead love his country  --   --  ? LINCOLN Why not  --   --  ? A rattlesnake might love his own fence corner ! There are plenty of honest misguided men among them . I have been studying Baker 's report this afternoon  --   --  If I could just get hold of one Copperhead who knows the signs and passwords of their inner council , I 've worked out A PLAN THAT CAN WIN THIS FIGHT ! NICOLAY Suddenly . The very man may be on the way here at this moment ! LINCOLN Eagerly . What 's that  --   --  ? NICOLAY Thinking . Miss Winter is due here with her lover  --  a young Captain of Grant 's Army  --   --  Pauses . LINCOLN Well  --   --  ? NICOLAY Slowly . In view of the attempts to take your life  --  I made some inquiries to-day about him  --  I knew the White House would be without guards to-night  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ! What about him ? NICOLAY He was on McClellan 's staff at one time  --   --  LINCOLN That 's promising  --   --  ! NICOLAY He 's a McClellan man  --  then  --   --  LINCOLN Beyond a doubt  --   --  NICOLAY In the hospital the past two months he has heard a lot of bitter talk  --   --  LINCOLN Quickly . And may have joined The Knights of the Golden Circle  --   --  ! NICOLAY It 's almost a certainty  --   --  LINCOLN Of course . Their infernal agents haunt our hospitals daily , and pour their poison into every open wound  --   --  NICOLAY Prove to this boy to-night that these men are liars  --   --  LINCOLN If he 'll listen  --   --  NICOLAY He 's got to listen ! He comes to ask of you a great favor  --   --  LINCOLN I wonder what ? NICOLAY I could n't find out . But you can use the opportunity to gain his confidence . He is engaged to a girl who is Mrs. Lincoln 's intimate friend  --  a girl who admires and trusts you . You can win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With excited emphasis . Do n't you worry  --  I 'm going to try  --   --  ! Pauses.  --  You wait and show them in . I 'll report to Mother my talk with McClellan . She 'll be uneasy about it . I 'll be back in a minute  --   --  NICOLAY All right , sir . LINCOLN exits . NICOLAY watches him go with deep sympathy , shaking his head as BETTY and VAUGHAN enter . Oh , Miss Winter  --   --  BETTY Captain Vaughan ,  --  Colonel Nicolay  --   --  NICOLAY Studying VAUGHAN . Pleased to meet you , Captain  --  the President will be back in a moment . He has just stepped in to speak to Mrs. Lincoln . He is expecting you  --  make yourselves at home  --   --  BETTY Thank you , Colonel  --   --  NICOLAY exits . What 's the matter , dear  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Nothing  --  nothing  --   --  BETTY But your arm is trembling  --   --  I did n't realize you 're so weak  --  I keep forgetting that you 're just out of the hospital  --   --  VAUGHAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid of the strain of this interview  --   --  ! Pauses.  --  You 've never told me , dear  --  for what was your father imprisoned ? VAUGHAN Deliberately . He made a speech against the war in our town in Missouri and printed it in a pamphlet  --   --  BETTY Oh  --  for making and circulating seditious writing  --   --  VAUGHAN Technically , yes  --  in reality for exercising the right of free speech on a policy of the government  --   --  BETTY It may be very serious  --   --  Pauses.  --  I 've an idea  --   --  ! Let me stay and help you  --   --  VAUGHAN But I may have something to say that a girl 's ears should not hear  --   --  BETTY Please do n't say it ! You differ with the President in politics . You must say nothing to offend him  --   --  VAUGHAN I 'll not  --   --  ! I think I love my country as well as I love my father  --   --  BETTY Let me stay ! VAUGHAN You must n't  --  I do n't need a chaperone  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitterly . He does wield a terrible power , does n't he ? BETTY Yes  --  with the tenderness and love of a father  --   --  VAUGHAN Lightly . All right , dear , run along now , see Mrs. Lincoln and get the President to come  --   --  BETTY Ca n't I stay and help you  --   --  ? VAUGHAN No , no  --   --  BETTY It means so much to me now  --   --  ! She nestles in his arms and VAUGHAN kisses her . VAUGHAN I 'll know how to plead my cause  --   --  BETTY All right  --  good luck . I 'm sure you 'll win  --   --  BETTY exits . VAUGHAN walks to the door leading to the Lincoln Apartments , and listens a moment , and walks to the President 's desk . His eye rests on the worn copy of the Bible which LINCOLN always kept on his desk . He gazes at the thumbed pages in amazement . VAUGHAN The Bible  --  My God ! Turns its leaves . And every page thumbed  --   --  ! He continues to turn the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heard outside talking to MRS . LINCOLN . LINCOLN Outside . Go back , and talk to Miss Betty ! VAUGHAN quickly places the Bible back on his desk and takes his stand near the door to the hall , as if he had just entered . LINCOLN enters from the other door , still talking to his wife who follows him . Do n't worry , Mother ! Who cares for a few old dresses more or less in these times ! But if I 'd known they cost that much , I 'd taken a second look at them and tried to get my money 's worth ! MRS . LINCOLN You 're sure it wo n't influence your decision ? LINCOLN Not a bit ! If we stay here  --  it 'll be all right . We can skimp a little . If we do n't stay  --  the old sign still swings on the door in Springfield  --  Billy Herndon 's waiting for me and the law business will be better than ever . Go back now , and do n't worry ! It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door after she goes , and comes down toward the desk , lifts his haggard eyes in a dazed way and looks about the room . Anxiety and suffering again mark his rugged face . He sees VAUGHAN , and at once throws off the spell of his troubles , advances to meet him and takes his hand . I 'm glad to see you , my boy  --  Will you pull up a chair ? LINCOLN drops wearily into his chair and his voice has a far-away dreamy expression in its tones while he studies VAUGHAN carefully . And what can I do for you ? VAUGHAN My name is Vaughan  --  the elder son of Dr. Richard Vaughan of Palmyra , Missouri  --   --  LINCOLN Thoughtfully . Vaughan  --  Richard Vaughan  --  I 've heard that name  --  But you 're one of our boys fighting with Grant 's army ? VAUGHAN Yes  --   --  LINCOLN Looking him over . You 've been very ill , I see  --  wounded of course ? VAUGHAN Yes  --   --  LINCOLN Rises , takes VAUGHAN 'S hands in both his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for one of our wounded boys  --  if I can  --   --  VAUGHAN Thank you  --   --  LINCOLN What is it ? VAUGHAN With cold precision . My mother writes me that my father has been arrested without warrant , is held in prison without bail , and denied the right of trial  --   --  He pauses , trembling with excitement . LINCOLN Go on  --  my boy  --   --  VAUGHAN I have come to ask for justice  --   --  LINCOLN He shall have it  --   --  VAUGHAN I ask that he be confronted by his accusers in open court and given a fair trial  --   --  LINCOLN Interrupting . For what was he arrested ? VAUGHAN For exercising the right of free speech . In a public address , he denounced the war  --   --  LINCOLN Oh !  --  And his address was printed ? LINCOLN picks up the little booklet and looks again at the title page and then at VAUGHAN . VAUGHAN He had as much right to print as to speak it  --   --  LINCOLN No , he had n't  --   --  Pauses and looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaughan  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Yes  --  Dr. Richard Vaughan  --  and I ask for him a fair trial confronted by his accusers  --  I ask for justice  --  will you grant him this trial  --   --  ? LINCOLN lays the pamphlet down on his desk and rises . LINCOLN Shakes his head . I can not  --   --  ! I can not do it ! He folds his arms behind his back and paces the floor , unconscious of the glitter of murder in VAUGHAN 'S eyes . VAUGHAN slowly draws his revolver and is about to lift to fire , when LINCOLN suddenly turns and speaks . With sharp emphasis . That little pamphlet , sir , found its way into the ranks and caused a number of soldiers to desert  --   --  VAUGHAN Who says this ? LINCOLN I happen to know it ! LINCOLN pauses and shakes his head sorrowfully . You see , my boy , your house is divided against itself  --  the symbol of our unhappy country . Of course , I did n't know of this particular case . Such things hurt me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They tell me that Seward and Stanton have arrested without warrant and hold in jail more than thirty-five thousand men at this moment . I hope the number is exaggerated  --  still it may be so  --   --  VAUGHAN Angrily . It 's true  --  I 've learned it since my father 's arrest ! LINCOLN Tenderly . But , come now , my son , put yourself in my place ! I 'm here to save the Union for which you are fighting  --  for which you have poured out your blood . I 've armed two million men and we are spending four millions a day , to fight the South for trying to secede . My opponents , taking advantage of our sorrow , harangue the people and elect hostile legislatures in the Northern states . They were about to pass ordinances of Secession and establish a Northwestern Confederacy ! Shall I fight Secession in the South and merely argue with it here ? I was compelled to suspend the civil law , arrest these men and hold them without bail or trial  --   --  VAUGHAN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINCOLN Shaking his head sadly . I have been entrusted with that power for a brief term by the people . I am using it sorrowfully but firmly  --  and I am backed by the prayers of the mothers whose sons are dying for our cause  --  and the silent millions out there , whom I ca n't at this moment see  --  but whom I love and trust . VAUGHAN With angry tears . The Constitution of the Republic guarantees to every freeman the right to trial in open court , confronted by his accusers  --   --  LINCOLN Passionately . But we are fighting a war for the life of the Constitution itself ! I did not begin it . Once begun it must be fought to the end and the Nation saved . We must prove now that among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bayonet . To preserve the Constitution of the Republic I must in this crisis strain some of its provisions  --   --  VAUGHAN In hard tones . And you will not interfere to give these accused men a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be suspended for the moment  --  as the law of life is suspended while the surgeon cuts a cancer out of bleeding flesh ! I can not shoot one soldier for desertion if I allow the man to go free who causes him to desert  --   --  He pauses , and puts his hands on VAUGHAN 'S shoulders . Do n't think , my son , that all the suffering of this war is not mine ! Every shell from those guns finds my heart . The tears of widows and orphans  --  all , the blue and the gray  --  are mine ! For we are equally responsible for this war ! When I came here from the West , I found a panic-stricken North , strangling with the poison of Secession . Our fathers had only dreamed a Union  --  they never lived to see it . The North had threatened Secession for thirty years . Horace Greeley in his great paper on the day of my inauguration was telling the millions who hung on his word as the oracle from Heaven , that Secession was inevitable ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " was his daily cry . I could not have prevented this war , nor could Jefferson Davis . We are in the grip of mighty forces sweeping in from the centuries . We are fighting the battle of the ages  --   --  He pauses again . But our country 's worth it , my boy , if we can only save it ! Out of this agony will be born a united people . There has never been a democracy in this world because there 's never been one without the shadow of a slave . We must build a real Government of the people , by the people , for the people . It 's not the question merely of four million black slaves . It 's a question of the life of freemen yet unborn . I hear the tread of these coming millions . Their destiny is in your hands and mine . A mighty Union of free democratic states without a slave  --  the hope , refuge and inspiration of the world  --  a beacon light on the shores of time ! Pauses.  --  There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light , and that is that this blood we are now pouring out shall have flowed in vain , and these brave men shall die for naught , that the old curse shall remain , the Union be broken into hostile sections and these battles must be fought again . He pauses , breathes deeply , and lifts his figure as if to throw off another nightmare and slips his arm around VAUGHAN . My enemies call me a tyrant and usurper ! I who came up here from a pioneer 's cabin in the wilderness , out of rags and poverty  --   --  Pauses.  --  How well I remember when my mother looked at them and said  --  " This is nothing  --  it does n't count here  --  it 's what you feel  --  it 's what you believe  --  it 's what you see that counts  --   --  " Struggles with his emotions . Now I 'm going to show you something , my son , and I 'll let you be the judge as to whether I 'm a tyrant  --  He takes up the booklet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VAUGHAN Reading in amazement . " Why Should Brothers Fight ? " By Dr. Richard Vaughan . LINCOLN That pamphlet was taken by his sister from the pocket of a poor ignorant boy , who was sentenced to be shot for desertion to-morrow at sunrise  --   --  VAUGHAN No ! No !  --   --  LINCOLN I pardoned him this morning  --   --  VAUGHAN sighs his relief . Your father wrote and printed that poison , and has forfeited his life for that boy 's act  --   --  VAUGHAN Trembling . I know you could order his execution  --   --  LINCOLN I said to-day that I 'd hang such a man on a gallows forty cubits high  --  but now that I see you trembling  --   --  He pauses . I shall not order his execution . I shall only hold him until the war is over , and then let him and all the others go  --   --  Pauses . Tyrant and usurper they call me ! And I 'm the humblest man who walks the earth to-night ! VAUGHAN Slowly sinking to a seat and covering his face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  my God  --   --  ! LINCOLN Bending in sorrowful amazement and touching VAUGHAN 'S head . Why ,  --  what 's the matter , my boy  --   --  ? I 'm the only man to despair . You 're just a Captain in the army . You have only to obey your superior officer . If to be the head of hell is as hard as what I 've had to undergo here , I could find it in my heart to pity Satan himself . And if there 's a man outside of perdition who suffers more than I do , I pity him  --   --  ! VAUGHAN Springing to his feet and throwing his hands up in anguish . You do n't understand  --   --  ! You do n't understand  --   --  ! LINCOLN Understand  --  what  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Impetuously . When I lay in the hospital suffering from my wounds , I received the letter telling me of my father 's imprisonment . I must have gone mad  --  for when you refused to-night to give him a trial  --  I started to  --  kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . LINCOLN To kill me  --   --  ! You are the second man to try it . He 'll get me the next time  --  I who envy the dead their rest ! Laughs . What a strange thing this life of ours ! Pauses . Why did n't you do it  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Because , for the first time you made me see things as they are , and I got a glimpse of the inside  --   --  LINCOLN Eagerly . Then , I won  --  did n't I  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Yes  --  and I can never forgive myself the thought of harming you  --   --  ! LINCOLN Ignoring his grief . If I 've won you , I can win others , if I only get their ear and make them know as you know ! All I need is a little time ! And I 'm going to fight for it now  --   --  With quick uplift of spirit . I 've told you the truth and the truth has turned a murderer into my friend ! If only the people can know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'll win  --  ! Look here  --  I 've won you now  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Eagerly . Just give me a chance to prove it  --   --  ! LINCOLN studies VAUGHAN thoughtfully . LINCOLN You doubtless said many bitter things in Washington ? VAUGHAN Many of them  --   --  LINCOLN Then , you were approached by the leaders of a Copperhead Secret Order called The Knights of the Golden Circle  --  were you not ? VAUGHAN Yes  --   --  ! LINCOLN I thought so  --   --  Cautiously . You  --  joined the Order  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Hesitates . I joined , and I 'm one of their officers  --   --  LINCOLN Carefully . Of their inner council ? VAUGHAN Yes  --   --  LINCOLN You  --  know  --  all their signs and passwords ? VAUGHAN Every one  --   --  LINCOLN With sudden deep excitement . Young man , you may have thought you came here to-night with murder in your heart  --  but Almighty God sent you for a different purpose  --   --  ! VAUGHAN What do you mean ? LINCOLN You 'll stand by me now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count it an honor to die for you  --   --  ! LINCOLN Well , I 'm going to ask you to do something harder than that for a man of sensitive honor . These Copperhead traitors took advantage of your illness and grief over your father to inveigle you into a scheme of high treason  --   --  VAUGHAN What  --   --  ! LINCOLN You believed their purpose to be patriotic  --  did n't you  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Of course  --   --  LINCOLN Seizing BAKER 'S Report . This document from Baker 's Office contains the original order of their Chief for an uprising on the night of the election  --   --  VAUGHAN Uprising for what  --   --  ? LINCOLN To overturn the Government , recognize the Confederacy , and divide the Union  --   --  VAUGHAN Is it possible  --   --  ! LINCOLN You know  --  after what has passed between us to-night  --  that I speak the truth  --   --  VAUGHAN Yes  --   --  ! LINCOLN You came in here to demand a trial for your father  --  and find him in reality justly condemned to death . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongs and your own tragic mistake , by placing yourself with the signs and passwords of that Society at my disposal . You have been basely deceived and betrayed  --  will you do it ? VAUGHAN If my country calls  --  yes  --  and I 'll thank God for the chance to atone  --   --  ! LINCOLN Good  --   --  ! You are the one man on earth to-night whom I need and did n't think I could get ! I 'm going to send you on a dangerous mission . I need two things to carry this election and save the Union  --  a single victory in the field to lift our people out of the dumps , and a word from Jefferson Davis that there can be no peace save in division ! I know Davis . We were both born in Kentucky , on almost the same day . He holds that position . But the peace party of the North refuse to believe it . They say he will compromise . Now I 've sent two men down there  --  Colonel Jacquess , a Methodist clergyman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tribune , old Greeley 's paper . They go as private citizens of the North , who desire peace . They are to draw Davis out , and get his declaration for me . Technically , they are spies  --  for they have no credentials . They may be imprisoned or executed . They passed through our lines but twenty miles from Richmond , seven days ago . I have n't been able to hear from them . The silence is ominous . VAUGHAN And you wish me to find out what has happened to them  --   --  ? LINCOLN Eagerly . I want another man in Richmond , quick  --  whose identity will be unknown  --  a man who can win the confidence of Judah P. Benjamin , Davis ' Secretary of State , who is preventing my interview with the Confederate President . Benjamin is the ablest and by far the most dangerous man in the South to-day . I know from this document on my desk  --   --  Touches BAKER 'S Report. that he is in close touch with the Copperhead Societies of the North  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their signs and passwords . It seems too good to be true ! If you carry to Benjamin a special report of this planned uprising , you can gain his confidence , and persuade him to let my men see Davis . If you can only get through the lines and reach him before being arrested  --   --  ! VAUGHAN I 've a brother in General Lee 's army  --  sir  --  for whom I 've often been mistaken before the war  --   --  LINCOLN That 's great  --   --  ! VAUGHAN He is an officer too  --  a First Lieutenant . LINCOLN Fine ! Before you go , confer with Baker . He will give you the names of our agents in Richmond and decide on your disguise . He will probably put you in Confederate uniform and make out in your brother 's name a rebel leave of absence to use in an emergency . You are a Southern man . Your accent is perfect . Your chances of success great . I want you to leave within an hour  --   --  He writes on two cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINCOLN If you can get for Jacquess and Gilmore a hearing and they are allowed to return and tell their story , all right  --  your work in Richmond is done . But if they are imprisoned or executed , report this fact and Mr. Davis ' answer , and it will be doubly effective  --  you understand  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Perfectly , sir  --   --  LINCOLN That 's your first job . Your next will be to get a special message through from inside the Confederacy to General Sherman , who is laying siege to Atlanta . Takes up telegram . This message from him , received this morning , says that he has as yet been unable to locate and count up Hood 's second line of defense which he must fight in a flank movement . Take the train from Richmond to Atlanta . Keep your eyes open every foot of the way . Find out from inside , the position of this second line , and the number of regiments holding it . Make no mistake about it . Break through to Sherman , and report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I believe I can do it  --   --  LINCOLN That 's the way to talk , my boy  --   --  ! When you reach General Sherman , you will deliver to him a verbal message  --  I 'll give you a sign that will identify you . This is the big thing I 'm sending you to do . I could telegraph my order direct to Sherman , but it would have to be filed in the War Office , and might offend General Grant . As an officer , you understand that  --   --  VAUGHAN Clearly , sir  --   --  LINCOLN For this reason I 'm sending you on this urgent and dangerous business . Tell General Sherman for me , that if he can take Atlanta at once , the blow will lift our people from despair , carry the election , and save the Union ! I send by you the order for him to strike . If he wins , the order will remain a secret  --  the credit shall all be his ! If he strikes and loses , I 'll publish my order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do this  --   --  ? VAUGHAN Quietly . I 'll do it  --  or I 'll die trying , sir  --   --  LINCOLN Writing on the back of his card . All right , take this card to Stanton 's Office and tell him what I 've told you . Ask him to arrange to send you by boat to Aquia , Virginia , by horse from there . This card to Baker 's Office  --  Return here for your papers , and say good-by to your sweetheart  --   --  VAUGHAN At once , sir  --   --  LINCOLN My boy  --  I trust you implicitly ! My mother 's God has been talking to me since you entered this room ! You 've lifted my spirit to the heights ! VAUGHAN exits . CURTAIN ACT III SCENE I SET SCENE : Jefferson Davis ' room in the Confederate Capitol at Richmond , two days later . A long table is on the right . Two small tables on left . Doors right and left , and mantel center . AT RISE : A DOORMAN in Confederate uniform arranges the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meeting . BENJAMIN enters . BENJAMIN Mr. Davis has not yet arrived  --   --  ? THE DOORMAN Not yet , Mr. Benjamin  --  I am expecting him at ten o'clock  --  it 's now a quarter of  --   --  BENJAMIN I 've asked a young man to wait in your room for me  --  has he come  --   --  ? THE DOORMAN He 's there now  --  sir  --   --  BENJAMIN You 've talked with him freely  --   --  ? THE DOORMAN Laughs . Oh , yes , sir  --  we 've been swappin ' yarns for half an hour  --   --  BENJAMIN I thought so  --  that 's why I asked him to wait in your room  --   --  THE DOORMAN Well , I always try to be sociable  --   --  ! BENJAMIN I know ! Did you get much out of him ? THE DOORMAN Why , how  --  how do ye mean ? BENJAMIN Find out anything about his people  --  where he came from , where he 's going to  --  what he 's doing in Richmond ? THE DOORMAN Oh , no , sir ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most o ' the time  --   --  BENJAMIN I see  --   --  ! Laughs . He knows his business . Show him in . THE DOORMAN Yes , sir  --   --  BENJAMIN seats himself at one of the small tables at left and examines his schedule for the day 's work . THE DOORMAN opens the door and shows VAUGHAN in , dressed in Confederate uniform . BENJAMIN rises and greets him cordially . BENJAMIN Good morning , young man  --   --  Gives VAUGHAN the Sign of the Knights of the Golden Circle . VAUGHAN Returns Sign . Good morning , Mr. Benjamin  --  I hope you 've rested well ? BENJAMIN Not so well as usual  --  the truth is I 've been wrestling all night with the problem of Jacquess and Gilmore . I 've confirmed your view that they have given their real names . Gilmore is a reporter of the New York Tribune and Colonel Jacquess is a Methodist clergyman well known in the hospital service , in fact famous for his kindly treatment of Southern prisoners  --   --  VAUGHAN Just as I told you  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been holding them in custody to bring them here this morning  --   --  VAUGHAN Good ! BENJAMIN Last night , I made up my mind to take your advice and to let them see Mr. Davis  --   --  VAUGHAN I 'm glad  --   --  BENJAMIN This morning I 'm puzzling over it ! VAUGHAN Showing his disappointment . Why  --   --  ? BENJAMIN I agree with you that we could use the interview for our own purposes . But the trouble is , Mr. Davis is soft-hearted sometimes . He may refuse to take my advice . He may let these men go . VAUGHAN You surely can depend on his allowing you to hold them in Libby Prison until after the election ? BENJAMIN I 'm not sure of it . If he takes a notion to let them go  --  he 's as stubborn as a mule . VAUGHAN All right  --  Let me be present at the interview and take notes . If Mr. Davis makes an important declaration about peace and lets them go , I 'll beat them to the North and give your version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do that  --  yes  --   --  ! VAUGHAN I could not only head off any injury from their report , but I could give it a twist that would make it a boomerang on Lincoln  --   --  BENJAMIN hesitates while VAUGHAN watches him breathlessly . BENJAMIN Thinking . You could act as my special secretary for the meeting and take shorthand notes  --  or pretend to  --   --  VAUGHAN I take shorthand . I 've been a reporter in Washington  --   --  BENJAMIN Then it would be easy . VAUGHAN No matter what is said , I can make a report that will harden the purpose of our Societies to swing the uprising on the night of the election . BENJAMIN You are sure the order for the revolt against the Lincoln Government has been issued ? VAUGHAN Absolutely sure . BENJAMIN I know they have discussed it and may have decided to do it , but are the actual preparations under way ? VAUGHAN In every Lodge of the Knights of the Golden Circle , the command is now on record . Our forces are being drilled . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander  --   --  BENJAMIN Elated . It 's great news you 've brought us , young man  --  great news ! BENJAMIN hesitates and VAUGHAN watches him . All right , we 'll risk it  --   --  ! VAUGHAN shows his secret joy and deep excitement . These men are Lincoln 's spies beyond a doubt  --  but we 'll dig out of them all the information possible , and then use them for our purpose  --   --  THE DOORMAN enters . THE DOORMAN Judge Ould , the Commissioner of Exchange  --   --  OULD enters . OULD Our visitors are outside , Mr. Benjamin . BENJAMIN You understand , Judge Ould , that these men are prisoners of war in your charge as Exchange Commissioner ? OULD I am painfully aware of that fact , sir  --  and the responsibility is not to my liking . BENJAMIN While in Richmond , they are to be held under the strictest guard and on no conditions allowed a liberty except by my order , or the order of the President . OULD I can trust them here with you , I hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in . VAUGHAN takes his seat at the small table near BENJAMIN who gives him a note book and he prepares to take notes . OULD reenters conducting JACQUESS and GILMORE . OULD Colonel James F. Jacquess and Mr. John R. Gilmore ,  --  Mr. Secretary of State  --   --  OULD bows and exits , while BENJAMIN advances with marked cordiality to greet his visitors . He does not shake hands but bows politely . BENJAMIN I am delighted to see you , gentlemen  --  pray be seated . The two men sit and GILMORE shoots at VAUGHAN a look of startled recognition which VAUGHAN fails to return . You bring overtures from your Government I trust . JACQUESS No , sir , we bring no overtures  --   --  GILMORE We have no authority from our Government . JACQUESS We have come simply as private citizens to know what terms will be acceptable to Mr. Davis for ending the war ? BENJAMIN You are acquainted with Mr. Lincoln 's views , however ? JACQUESS One of us is fully  --   --  BENJAMIN I supposed so . May I ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? GILMORE No , sir . We came on his pass through the lines , of course , but not by his request . JACQUESS We came , Mr. Benjamin , simply as men and Christians , not as diplomats , hoping in a frank talk with Mr. Davis to discover some way by which this war may be stopped . BENJAMIN On my advice , gentlemen , Mr. Davis will see you  --   --  JAQUESS AND GILMORE Thank you  --   --  BENJAMIN I think he is here now  --   --  BENJAMIN exits . GILMORE In low tones to VAUGHAN . What are you doing here ? VAUGHAN Writing ! I do n't know you  --   --  GILMORE The hell you do n't ! VAUGHAN No ! GILMORE We worked on the same paper in Washington , once  --   --  VAUGHAN Never saw you before  --   --  GILMORE Get-word-through-will you ! We 're in a trap ! VAUGHAN Shut your damned trap ! or we 'll both make our breakfast on lead at sunrise to-morrow morning ! Get back to your seat ! The sound of approaching steps are heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BENJAMIN Gentlemen : The President of the Confederate States of America ! DAVIS enters and bows to his visitors , who rise . His figure is about five foot ten and quite thin . His features are typically the Southern scholar and thinker with angular cheeks and high cheek bones . His iron gray hair is long and thick and inclined to curl at the ends . His whiskers are thin and trimmed farmer fashion , on the lower end of his strong chin . His eyes flash with strong vitality . His forehead is broad , his mouth strong . He wears a brown suit of foreign cloth which fits him perfectly . His shoulders slightly droop . His manner is easy and graceful , his voice charming and cultured . DAVIS I am glad to meet you , gentlemen . You are very welcome to Richmond . GILMORE We thank you , Mr. Davis . DAVIS Mr. Benjamin tells me that you have asked to see me  --   --  He pauses and waits for his visitors to finish the sentence . JACQUESS Yes , sir . Our people want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask how it may be brought about ? DAVIS Very simply . Withdraw your armies from the South , let us alone and Peace comes at once . JACQUESS But we can not let you alone so long as you seek to divide the Union . DAVIS I know . You deny us , what you exact for yourselves  --  the right of self-government . JACQUESS Even so , Mr. Davis , we can not fight forever . The war must end sometime . We must finally agree on something . Can we not find the basis of agreement now , and stop this slaughter ? VAUGHAN takes notes rapidly . DAVIS I wish peace as much as you do . I deplore bloodshed . But I feel that not one drop of this blood is on my hands . I can look up to God and say this . I tried to avert this war . I saw it coming and for twelve years I worked day and night to prevent it . The North was mad and blind and would not let us govern ourselves , and now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls in his tracks and their children seize their muskets and fight our battle  --  unless you acknowledge our right to self-government . We are not fighting for Slavery . We are fighting for independence and that or extermination we will have  --   --  JACQUESS Protesting . We have no wish to exterminate the South ! But we must crush your armies . Is it not already nearly done ? Grant has shut you up in Richmond , and Sherman is before Atlanta . DAVIS Laughs . You do n't seem to understand the situation ! We 're not exactly shut up in Richmond yet . If your papers tell the truth , it is your Capitol that is in danger , not ours . Lee 's front has never yet been broken . He holds Grant , invades the North and shells Washington . Sherman , to be sure , is before Atlanta . But suppose he is ? His position is a dangerous one . The further he goes from his base of supplies , the more disastrous defeat must be . And his defeat may be at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . How can you hope for success in the end ? DAVIS My friend , the South stands for a principle  --  their equal rights under the Constitution which their fathers created . This country has always been a Republic of Republics  --  not an Empire . We are fighting for the right of local self-government which we won from the tyrants of the old world . The states of the Union have always been sovereign . We never paused to figure on success or failure , sir . Five million Southern freemen drew their sword against twenty millions because their rights had been invaded . JACQUESS And yet , Mr. Davis , you know as well as I that five millions can not hold out forever against twenty . Have we not reached the end ? DAVIS Hardly ! Do you think there are twenty millions in the North still determined to crush us ? If so , let me tell you that I am better informed on the present situation inside your lines than you are . The North at this moment is hopelessly divided , sir  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then with your government is narrowed to this  --  union  --  or disunion ? DAVIS Let us say independence or subjugation . We mean to govern ourselves . We will hold this principle if we have to see every Southern plantation sacked and every city in flames  --   --  JACQUESS and GILMORE rise . VAUGHAN catches GILMORE 'S eye . JACQUESS I am sorry , sir . DAVIS takes JACQUESS ' hand in both his in the same way LINCOLN did . DAVIS I respect your character , Colonel Jacquess and your motives and I wish you well  --  every good wish possible consistent with the interests of the Confederacy  --   --  He presses GILMORE 'S hand and follows them to the door . JACQUESS Thank you . DAVIS At door . And say to Mr. Lincoln that I shall be pleased to receive proposals for peace direct from him , at any time , on the basis of our independence . It will be useless to approach me with any other . JACQUESS and GILMORE exit and OULD reenters . OULD To Davis . And shall I conduct these gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these men are spies straight from Lincoln 's desk . It 's the slyest trick the old fox has ever tried to play on us . He knows that McClellan 's election on a peace platform is a certainty . He 's after ammunition for this campaign . We dare not play into his hands ! Our very life may depend on it ! Make no mistake  --  these men must be locked up to-night and shot at sunrise . OULD Shakes his head . I would n't do it if I were you  --   --  BENJAMIN Why ? OULD For one reason this  --   --  OULD unfolds a note . Ben Butler sent this note to me by their hands . It was sealed . Read it . DAVIS Interrupting . Just a moment  --   --  To THE DOORMAN . General Lee is in the War Office  --  ask him if he can see me for a few minutes , please . THE DOORMAN bows and exits . Go on , gentlemen . OULD To BENJAMIN  --  handing him the note . Read it ! BENJAMIN Reading . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days , I shall demand them , and if you do n't produce them  --  I 'll execute two for one . " ( Signed ) B. F. BUTLER . " Angrily . Bluff ! Bluff ! DAVIS He 's a beast . He 'll do it . BENJAMIN All right ! Let him try it ! Two can play that game . We can execute four for one  --   --  DAVIS I do n't like these bloody reprisals . There 's no end , once we begin . BENJAMIN The decision is yours , sir . DAVIS I reserve my decision . I 'll give it to you presently . I want a word with General Lee  --  first  --  if you will give me this room . BENJAMIN Certainly , we 'll retire until you 're ready . This way . BENJAMIN conducts VAUGHAN and OULD into the room right  --  opposite the door through which JACQUESS and GILMORE made their exit.  --  THE DOORMAN enters and announces . THE DOORMAN General Lee ! DAVIS Advances cordially and takes LEE 'S hand in both of his . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a peculiar matter  --  of small importance from one point of view  --  of tremendous importance from another . Two men have been passed into our lines to sound me on the question of Peace . I have just talked with them . I am certain  --  so is Benjamin  --  that they come straight from Lincoln though they have no credentials . Benjamin demands their execution  --  Judge Ould protests . Are they spies ? LEE Technically , yes  --  morally , no . DAVIS Thank you . Before I decide whether to let these men go with a message to the North , I must ask you one or two questions  --   --  LEE At your service , sir . DAVIS How long can you hold Grant ? LEE Certainly a year  --  unless  --   --  DAVIS Yes ? LEE Unless Atlanta falls . DAVIS And then ? LEE If General Hood fails to hold Atlanta , Sherman can cut the South in two and my supplies fail . My men are living now on parched corn . If Sherman takes Atlanta , I can not get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment , General ? LEE A more formidable force was never set in motion than the army I command , sir . They are our stark fighters  --  men who individually or in the mass can be depended on for any feat of arms in the power of mortals to accomplish . I know them from experience . They will blanch at nothing  --  yet they must have food . DAVIS You shall have it . But after one year  --  then what ? LEE It 's solely a question of man power , sir . I must have more men . DAVIS And you suggest ? LEE That you immediately begin to arm and drill 500,000 negroes for my command . DAVIS And you think they would make good soldiers ? LEE Led by their old masters  --  they 'll fight  --  to a man . DAVIS It would be necessary to give each black volunteer his freedom ? LEE Of course . I , as you know , freed my own slaves before entering the service of the South . It is one of the ironies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I who refuse to own a slave and my opponent General Grant is through his wife 's estate a slaveholder . Slavery is doomed , sir . It can never survive this tragedy . The Legislature of Virginia came within one vote of freeing her slaves , years ago . DAVIS I know . But the great Gulf States and South Carolina with their majority of Negro population will never agree to the arming of half a million slaves . LEE And you will allow Mississippi , Louisiana , and South Carolina to defeat a plan necessary to save the life of the Confederacy ? DAVIS The States are sovereign , General Lee  --  for this principle we are fighting . LEE Then I think it may be time to ask ourselves , heart to heart , the question whether the Confederacy , as organized , does not carry within its own body the seeds of death ? The rights of a state must somewhere yield to the supreme power of a nation . The Negro will make a brave soldier , and he can save the South . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General , but I ca n't see it  --  I ca n't see it now . I wo n't detain you longer . GENERAL LEE salutes and exits  --  DAVIS goes to the opposite door  --  opens it and calls . I am ready , gentlemen . OULD , BENJAMIN and VAUGHAN reenter . BENJAMIN You have decided ? DAVIS Yes . He sits and writes a pass . It is probably a bad business for us  --   --  BENJAMIN There can be no doubt about that , sir  --   --  DAVIS But it would alienate many of our Northern friends if we held these men . I have decided to let them go . Give them this pass . Hands pass to OULD . Show them through the hospitals and Libby Prison and conduct them back to General Grant 's lines . OULD You have acted wisely , sir . BENJAMIN With deep feeling to VAUGHAN . He has made exactly the blunder I feared  --   --  VAUGHAN With elation . We 'll hope for the best , sir ! With the twist I 'll give the news  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acts I and II , except that a small table has been placed down center on the side near Lincoln 's desk . A telegraph instrument has been installed on this table . AT RISE : At rise , the audience sees only LINCOLN and OPERATOR , the lights gradually rise until full day shows the entire room . It is the morning of September 3 , 1864 . LINCOLN Bending over the key . Try to get Atlanta again , my boy . The OPERATOR tries again and again to get Atlanta . OPERATOR It 's no use , sir  --   --  LINCOLN We do n't seem to have any luck , do we ? My messenger should have reached Sherman ! He must be there now . He must be there  --  he ca n't be lost ! Laughs forlornly . Two whole days I 've listened to that thing click  --   --  The OPERATOR calls Atlanta , with a peculiar loud call . Is that the word Atlanta you 're clicking off ? OPERATOR Yes , sir  --  calling  --  over this wire we have a direct connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer either . LINCOLN Call Atlanta again . Do it slowly . I want to learn it  --  Uncle Billy  --   --  The OPERATOR clicks off each letter in the Morse Code , spelling it slowly . Must be there by this time ! OPERATOR A  --  T  --  L  --  A  --  N  --  T  --  A  --  G  --  A  --  Atlanta , Ga . LINCOLN Once more . The OPERATOR repeats the call and LINCOLN follows it repeating after him . I want to catch that as quick as you do  --  when it comes ! Aside . Oh , my God , why do n't it come !  --  Why do n't it come ! NICOLAY enters . NICOLAY The time 's up . Raymond and his damned Committee are here , sir , and insist on your final answer at Once  --   --  LINCOLN Hold them back awhile . We 're bound to hear something to-day . I promised them my decision this morning , I know  --  but I 'm still full of foolish hopes . NICOLAY They are not foolish hopes ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . The darn fool thing will talk one way but wo n't chirp the other . NICOLAY What shall I tell them ? LINCOLN Listening at the instrument . Anything  --  tell them a funny story ! Listening . They need a laugh  --  the bunch of undertakers ! Waiting for me to deliver my corpse to them !  --  Restless , because I have n't given it up sooner ! The sharp click of the telegraph receiver catches his ear and he starts to the table . No  --  that was n't it  --   --  Turns again to NICOLAY . Tell them positively , I will see them within half an hour . NICOLAY exits and LINCOLN returns to his vigil by the telegraph table . How close can you get to Atlanta over the Chattanooga line  --   --  ? OPERATOR Twenty miles out is the last station that answers and he do n't know what 's the matter with the line . LINCOLN Strange  --  we got closer than that yesterday  --  Sherman 's on the move .... BETTY enters timidly . That 's certain . Looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want . BETTY Nothing yet from General Sherman ? LINCOLN Nothing  --   --  BETTY And no message of any kind from John since he left ? LINCOLN Not yet . BETTY Why  --  why has n't he reported ? LINCOLN Hopefully . I 'm sure  --  remember , sure to a moral certainty  --  that he left Richmond safely . BETTY Eagerly . You have a message then ? LINCOLN Indirectly  --   --  BETTY Oh  --   --  LINCOLN To EDWARD at door . Edward , ask Mr. Gilmore to step in here a minute . EDWARD Yes , sir . LINCOLN Gilmore 's report ought to be worth half a million votes for me  --  it may be worth something to you  --  GILMORE enters . Gilmore , did you see a handsome young fellow in Confederate uniform taking notes at your interview with Davis  --   --  GILMORE Yes , sir , and I knew him too  --   --  BETTY Eagerly . It was Captain Vaughan ? GILMORE Sure ! He denied it , of course , but I knew him all right . BETTY He was well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared stiff , of course , and so were we  --   --  BETTY Thank you ! LINCOLN That 'll do , Gilmore . I wish you 'd help Nicolay choke that Committee off a little while  --  and you come with them when they break in  --  will you ? GILMORE Gladly , Mr. President . GILMORE exits . LINCOLN To BETTY lightly . Now you 've had some good news  --   --  BETTY Forlornly . How long since any word came from General Sherman ? LINCOLN Two days . I know the hole where he went in at . But I ca n't tell where the old varmint 's going to come out  --   --  BETTY Chokes . If he ever comes out ! LINCOLN Oh ! He 'll come out  --   --  He stops and listens at the telegraph instrument again , and sighs in disappointment . He 'll come out somewhere  --  It 's a habit Uncle Billy has  --   --  BETTY Hopelessly . They 've no news at the War Department either . LINCOLN No news is generally good news from Sherman . BETTY turns away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come , come , my dear  --  these tears wo n't do ! You 've got to help me now ! BETTY brushes the tears away . I may have sent your lover to his death . I know that ! But he went with a smile on his face and a great joy in his heart for the service he was doing his country  --   --  BETTY Yes  --  I know  --  I know  --  I 'm proud of the honor you did him . LINCOLN Whispering . Give me a little lift , then  --   --  Pauses . I 'm just whistling to keep up my courage ! He pauses again in an agony of suffering . I know that he got to Atlanta  --   --  Pauses . Sherman has disappeared ! BETTY Forgive me  --  I forgot . You 're going to win . I feel it . I know it ! LINCOLN That 's the way to talk ! That 's the way I 'm talking to myself though I 'm scared within an inch of my life  --   --  He pauses and goes over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you beat it a little harder and make the blame thing talk for us ? OPERATOR I wish I could , sir . LINCOLN Try him again  --   --  - The OPERATOR calls Atlanta and pauses  --  LINCOLN and BETTY bend over with breathless suspense . The instrument gives one click  --  LINCOLN starts . The instrument stops . Did n't the thing start to answer ? The OPERATOR shakes his head . Call the War Office and ask Stanton to step over here  --  My God  --  why ca n't we hear ! BETTY Wistfully . I 'm not going to cry again  --  but I just want to ask one question  --  you wo n't mind ? LINCOLN As many as you like ! BETTY He  --  he  --  had to enter Atlanta a spy , did n't he ? Sobs and catches herself . LINCOLN Yes  --  of course  --   --  BETTY Well , if he should be captured  --  could  --  they execute him without our knowing it ? LINCOLN They might  --  but he 's a very bright young man ! He 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know  --  I do n't know  --   --  ! LINCOLN Now listen  --  ! I 'm going to tell you something  --  I know ! I 've a sort of second sight that tells me things sometimes , my dear . After the battle of Gettysburg I saw General Daniel E. Sickles in the hospital . They told me that he was mortally wounded and could not possibly live . I told General Sickles that he would live and get well , and he did ! I saw his living body that day at work in health and strength as plainly as I see you ! We have not heard from Captain Vaughan yet , but it will come  --  ! He has reached Atlanta . The General got my message . I know that . I felt it flash through the air from his soul to mine ! I can see you and your lover at this moment seated side by side smiling and happy  --   --  BETTY In awe . You  --  see  --  this  --   --  ! LINCOLN In dreamy tones . As plainly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --   --  STANTON enters and LINCOLN turns to meet him eagerly . STANTON You 've no news ? LINCOLN I sent for you , to ask that  --   --  STANTON Nothing  --   --  LINCOLN In low tones . What does it mean ? STANTON A storm swept Atlanta yesterday  --  the wires may be all down  --   --  LINCOLN You think that 's it  --   --  ? STANTON No  --  I do n't . LINCOLN Neither do I  --   --  STANTON Something big has happened ! Sherman has either taken Atlanta or Hood has cut his communications and his army may be imperiled . LINCOLN His head droops . That 's what I think too  --  God help us ! The sharp click of the telegraph instrument causes him to start quickly , cross to the table and listen . The committee headed by RAYMOND and STEVENS crowd through the door against the protests of NICOLAY . NICOLAY I promised you an answer in half an hour , gentleman !  --  you must wait . RAYMOND Not another minute ! STEVENS Waving a telegram . The matter is too urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  --  I 'm ready . RAYMOND We have just heard a most painful and startling piece of news from the War Department  --   --  LINCOLN To STANTON . War Department  --   --  Low voice.  --  What is it , Stanton ? STANTON Something I did n't believe and would n't repeat to you . LINCOLN Whispering to OPERATOR . Pull for me , boy , pull for me  --  keep picking at that thing ! STEVENS Triumphantly . You were advised to withhold the new draft of men until after the election ! Well , read that copy of a telegram from New York , just received by General Halleck , sir ! Offers telegram to LINCOLN and he refuses to take it . LINCOLN I do n't want to read it , Stevens . Your face is enough for me . It must be bad , or you would n't be so happy . You 're almost smiling ! STEVENS Read it ! LINCOLN Ignoring the proffered telegram . You know , Stevens , you remind of an old farmer I knew in Illinois  --   --  The committee gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STEVENS Go on , give ' em the joke . It 's your funeral  --  not mine ! LINCOLN Facing the committee . This old farmer raised the biggest hog ever seen in the county . He was so fat the news of his size spread over the country and people came from far and near to see this wonder in pork . A stranger came up one day and asked the farmer to see him . The old man said : " Wal I 've got sech a animal an ' he 's the biggest one I ever seed . I 'll say that . But so many folks are comin ' here pesterin ' me to look at him , I 've decided to charge a shillin ' a look . " The stranger put his hand in his pocket , pulled out the money , paid the shilling , stared at the old man , turned and walked away . The farmer called after him  --  " Hi  --  there  --  ai n't yer goin ' ter see the hog ? " " No "  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got my money 's worth . " All laugh except STEVENS . During the laugh LINCOLN bends over the telegraph instrument  --  in low tones . How goes it , boy ? How goes it ? The OPERATOR shakes his head . Not a click  --   --  ? Operator shakes his head again  --  and LINCOLN 'S face contracts in suffering . STEVENS Just a minute , Mr. President ,  --  I 'll give you the telegram if you wo n't read it . LINCOLN Fire away , Stevens , if it makes you happy . STEVENS Reading . " New York , Sept. 3 , 1864 . " The Federal authorities have just discovered a nation-wide conspiracy to resist by force of arms the new draft . It will be necessary for General Grant to detach half his army from Lee 's front immediately to put down this counter revolution . Send these soldiers without delay to our great cities . " The signature is in code . RAYMOND It 's the blackest news yet , sir  --  and it 's true . STEVENS You must realize that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the ticket . There is a moment of dead silence while all watch LINCOLN 'S face . Suddenly the sharp click of the telegraph instrument begins to spell the word A-T-lanta . LINCOLN starts  --  his face flashing with excitement . LINCOLN What 's that ? He follows breathlessly the spelling of the full word  --  his face expressing his joy . OPERATOR Mr. President  --  It 's come ! It 's here ! LINCOLN rushes to the table , the crowd following . It 's for you , sir ! LINCOLN Out with it , boy , word for word as you get it ! OPERATOR Click-click . Atlanta  --  Click-click . Georgia  --  Click-click-click . September 3 , 1864 . LINCOLN Glory to God !

LINCOLN Unto thee , O God , we give all the praise now and forever more ! MRS . LINCOLN enters with BETTY and rushes to meet the President . He takes her in his arms . Mother ! It 's all right !  --  Uncle Billy 's there ! MRS . LINCOLN You 'll never doubt again ? LINCOLN Never !  --   --  Turning to the committee . My friends ! A poem is singing in my heart ! " Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord ! He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored : He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword  --  His truth is marching on ! " He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat ! He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat : Oh ! Be swift my soul to answer Him ! Be jubilant my feet ! Our God is marching on ! " STANTON That draft will be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all sing . LINCOLN listens with bowed head . We are coming , Father Abraham , three hundred thousand more , From Mississippi 's winding stream and from New England 's shore ; We leave our plows and workshop , our wives and children dear , With hearts too full for utterance , with but a single tear , We dare not look behind us but steadfastly before , We are coming , Father Abraham , three hundred thousand more ! CHORUS We are coming , we are coming , our Union to restore ! We are coming , Father Abraham , three hundred thousand more , We are coming , Father Abraham , three hundred thousand more ! LINCOLN And remember , gentlemen , U. S. Grant sent Sherman on that mission . You know I did n't remove him ! Well , Raymond , what say you , now ! RAYMOND It 's glorious . It 's a miracle ! Lee 's army ca n't survive . The end is sure ! McClellan is beaten  --  the Union is saved ! LINCOLN What say you all ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep the nation , sir !

STEVENS You 're not elected yet , sir  --  and such levity ill becomes a Nation 's Chief in these tragic hours  --   --  LINCOLN Laughs . If I could n't laugh I 'd have died long ago at this job ! CURTAIN EPILOGUE SET SCENE : The great pillars of the Capitol at Washington fill the entire stage from arch to arch . In the foreground stands the platform on which the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States , headed by Salmon P. Chase , Chief Justice , are grouped about the President , who is delivering his Second Inaugural . JOHN VAUGHAN beside BETTY WINTER is conspicuously leading the applause . AT RISE : The President is reading his Inaugural . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing before the curtain rises : LINCOLN Before rise .

Fondly do we hope  --  fervently do we pray  --  that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away . Yet , if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman 's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said , " The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether .
