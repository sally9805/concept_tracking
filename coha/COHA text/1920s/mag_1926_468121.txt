RECENTLY there came to me from a city which I have long known and admired for its fervent American normalcy , tidings of such unusual import as to suggest to a naturally timorous mind the impending dissolution of an era . A friend brought them to me when , as occasionally happens , he stopped over between trains to invigorate the lonely leisure of an editorial office with the gossip of a world of busy men . In his own community my visitor is famous as " the most regular fellow in town . " He has a reputation not only for being ready and willing to join anything for anybody but also for being able to get almost anybody to join anything for him . On account of these rare gifts he has assisted at the births , sickbeds , and triumphs of more civic , service , and commercial organizations than any living contemporary . Under these circumstances I quite naturally asked him first what movement for bigger and better impossibil-ities he was organizing now . " Nothing , " he said with an unexpected jauntiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He knew , he went on , because a few weeks before he had been chosen for the solemn duty of telephoning to twentyfive leaders of his community and seem ' - ing their attendance at two successive dinners for the discussion of a certain civic project . The auguries were propitious . The gentlemen were congenial and of the same level of prominence . The projectrequired nothing of them in uplift enthusiasm , sustained moral effort , or financial support . It was delicately conveyed that the party would be wet . Nevertheless , it foozled . " They were afraid , " my friend explained , " that if they came the organization lightning would strike them and it would turn into some new kind of a luncheon club . " Only eight of the twenty-five showed up at the first dinner , and the second was never held . Still more scandalous , by my friend 's account , was the conversation of those who took the risk . They discussed with admiring gusto rumors that one of the absentees was resigning from the Kiwanis Club and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he has " been converted by the American Mercury " and desired more time to attend to his business . They talked of Mr. Mencken 's Prejudices and Mr. Sinclair Lewis ' novels . They concluded amiably and with no dissent that in pillorying the back-slapping and forced ballyhooing orgies of business gentlemen in comradeship , Messrs . Mencken , Lewis , and their tribe " were doing the service clubs a lot of good . " " But what about the red peril ? " asked not without malice . " I thought you organized , constructive-minded people were the last thin white line against the apocalyptic beast . " " The only red peril nowadays , " he aired his new sophistication , " is more luncheon clubs . " A few days later there came to my desk the marked copy of one of those numerous national periodicals which , ostensibly devoted to the dissemination of better business methods , actually cultivate their field by flattering the business man 's pet complacencies . The article suggested for my attention reminded its readers that , far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause for pride and glory to the regular he-man to be a booster and a Babbitt . Critics might sneer , it went on unctuously , but the Babbitts ' constructive genius alone had built American civilization and made it superior to all other civilizations . Did not these scorned men of worth comprise the only class in. the republic which paid its bills and lived with one wife ? Did they not , single-handed and with mighty toil , produce the wealth which made it possible for these narrow-chested critics to educate themselves into finished knockers of the good , the true , the efficient , the patriotic ? Were they not actually providing these degenerate parasites , who criticized only because they could not be successful go-getters themselves , with a market for their works of bolshevism and destruction ? Finally , the way to stop this vicious and dangerous flippancy was for a little group of would-be sophisticates and approval-seekers among business men ? worse than the critics because they were renegades to their class and their intelligent self-interest ? to stop giving the professional yelpers a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend with a marginal query . Had he joined the new decadents ? Whether or not II the taunt was justified , the sociological horizon is crowded with signs that the new decadence is increasing . Its growth , indeed , is historically foreshadowed . This will not be the first time the American business man has proved that no builder of a nation 's destinies was ever so sensitive to criticism , so easily changed in mannerisms , ideas , and mores by harsh words and unkind ridicule . For example , in the republic 's romantic youth , when its aristocracy aped the social traditions of feudal Europe , the business man labored under the reproach which had afflicted the bourgeoisie almost from the hour when social traditions were invented . He was " in trade , " and trade was , for inexplicable reasons , a low station . Hence , the colonially descended first families in the northeast and the flamboyant plantation peerage of the south patronized him as a good but humble creature in their literature and failed to invite him to their more exclusive parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slur by becoming a social leader himself . Perhaps this ancestral victim of the inferiority complex had no natural inclination for the bland joys of ballroom dictatorship , but the attainment was worth the incidental pangs . If the pangs and the difficulties were too great at home , somewhere he must go where he could be " as good " as his scorners . Thus Texas and the wilder frontiers of the old South claimed him and , there , assisted by the chaos of pioneering and the later crash of insecure social values in the Civil War , he proved that storekeeping was as genteel and elevated as planting . Or scourged out of the North Atlantic states by his sense of humble origin , he descended upon . the new towns of the Middle West , won wealth and preempted a new social leadership , all his own and uncontested . Pushed on by his wife and daughters , he mastered the arts of dining out , of polite entertaining , of round dancing and dignified euchre-playing in mixed company . Often he cultivated connoisseurship in wines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Pacific growing little cities swarmed with these resourceful Mel Harringtons , these selfmade arbiters of elegance whose social lives were devoted to disproving an ancient reproach . Here a wholesale grocer audited invitation lists with an almost fanatical eye to gradations of prominence and tones of breeding . There a Nordic clothing merchant censored rowdy manners . Furniture dealers set the pace for fashionable gayety in the consulship of Chester A. Arthur . In their old age , patricianship sat so securely upon them that as a matter of course they became first presidents of the new and swagger country clubs . Perhaps they had forgotten that in the republic of equal opportunities but by no means of equal social positions the reproach of " trade " had ever existed . Certainly their sons and grandsons never heard of it until confronted by the desolating blasts of modern sophisticated literature . Thus on the first apt occasion , the go-getter 's courtly ancestor proved his ability to give his critics what they wanted . Another occasion was for a long while lacking , but it came . The era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1896 . There had been rumbles of heresy before , in the abortive labor movements of the ' 70s and ' 80s , in the two Cleveland victories , in the Populist uprising , and the free silver cult . But now that prosperity had returned and the country could afford it , the disillusionment spread to all society . There was a sudden turning against the old folk heroes by the humble employes and the climbing " little fellows " who before had yearningly admired the lordly ways of the Crcesi , local and national ; had worshipped their very corruptions as the symbol of " smartness , " their hideous mansions and formal manners as symbols of aristocratic worth . Journalistic typewriters found tongue and , with the august Roosevelt for master of the hounds , the full frowzy outcry of the muck-raking pack burst upon the ears of a delighted republic . Amid the bedlam , however , the accusations could be plainly distinguished . The business man was a narrow , brutal , soulless monster of rapacity , lusting after the sweat of his employes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors , undermining the virtue of politicians , the integrity of government , accomplishing the rack and ruin of all that was earnest and forwardlooking in the face of human nature . The grandson of the self-made oldschool gentleman who had so exquisitely responded to a subtle social slight was no personage to miss the implications of this direct frontal attack . He would again show the world that America was a country where these social critics got what they wanted . Was he harsh with his employes ? Behold the business gentleman , stung to the quick by the accusation , putting on welfare programs , getting behind the Y. M. C. A. and the local recreation efforts , and thereby removing the cause of his stinging . Was he grasping toward his customers ? At the height of the muck-rake age there was formed the Rotary Club of Chicago , with the motto , " Service above self . " Though no one yet knew it , this foreshadowed countless imitations and the most glorified orgy of selfadvertising service seen on earth since the early days of the mendicant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove his Christian love for them by journeying from the ends of the continent to meet them in national conventions where , in more or less deep potations , he would resolve that he and they had common interests , and in roaring ditties of boon companionship would exalt their mutual affections with the sentiment that " Old George Smith , he ai n't what he used to he . " Was he the boss of governors and the debaucher of legislators ? He would remove the curse by following the zealously reforming Roosevelt , by banding himself with his kind in local young business men 's leagues to see that only the earnest and the " clean cut " should serve the people . He would form Chambers of Commerce to show municipal government where it should go and how much of the responsible taxpayer 's money it should spend . Was he the foe of the national virtues ? Watch him attach himself to the efficiency cults , the prohibition movements which proposed , by law , to extend compulsorily the blessings of his new virtues to the reactionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth-century mannerisms and conformities , George Follansbee Babbitt , was born in the year of the first Rotary club ? the child of the muck-rakers by the guilty and repentance-seeking conscience of the muck-raked . He was the darling pledge of American business that it can give its critics what they want . Alas , / fear his days are numbered , because a new generation of critics now wants something else , HI Such an alarming prophecy rests , fortunately , upon more than a thinly attended dinner at which the conversation was mildly unorthodox . From the constant defensive and propitiatory tactics of charter members and from the introspective clamor of the official organs , it is clear that the soul of what has been perhaps too ritualistically called Babbittry is in a ferment . It seethes hardly less with a desire to blunt the edge of satirical criticism than with a yearning for what experts in its efficiency jargons might call a new direction of development . Indeed , one 's sensations on consulting the recent files of the Rotarian and four or five of its leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedlam of printed self-consciousness . One encounters eagerness to prove that the American business men , in luncheon clubs assembled , stand for all the demonstrably solid virtues , that criticism is intolerably unjust and can only proceed from a desire to tear down each and all of our fundamental institutions . Yet often on the next page one is touched with pleas that the misunderstanding should be explained away to the critics by public announcements that the service clubs , far from being the parents of standardization , are the nurturers and the brightest hope of individualism in the contemporary republic . A little farther on one reads a savagely selfanalytical review of the spirit of these organizations leading up to the confession that the ostentatious and too loudly speaking exponents of " the service spirit " justify the criticism and that something ought to be done about this . Some of the gentlemen ? especially the letter contributors ? write in high temper , and few if any write with personal detachment . Some debate with one another openly , others clash with the chance gusto of wandering planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends at first to a genuine bewilderment . But , with fuller study , the struggle begins to take on definite proportions and directions . Out of the welter of opinions and remedies the central fact emerges that the creature so universally called Babbitt is as conversant with the current castigation of his codes and social activities as he was of the muckraking onslaughts of twenty years ago . If the testimony of his printed oracles is to be accepted , the American Mercury and the fiction of the Sinclair Lewis school bulk almost as large on his intellectual landscape as his business . Indeed , if the number and vehemence of the references be taken into account , such gadflies bulk even larger than his alleged-to-be-beloved Saturday Evening Post . And always , whether he react to the gadfly 's torments with wrath or with candid self-examination , his concern as to what his critics are saying about him , and as to their justice in saying it , is profound . Furthermore , his desire for the critic 's approval appears to be winning . Although the great house-organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organization problems , and as such necessarily admit much contentious and protesting matter , it is plain that , with both official and editorial blessing , tactics are being modified in the direction of conciliation . Has it been part of the criticism that the stricken Mr. Babbitt was an isolated provincial and proud of it ? If so , Mr. Babbitt , via his Rotary club , will show them . To achieve this , all of Rotary from San Diego to Bangor bustles this year ? a trifle self-consciously , but nevertheless bustles ? to attain its famous and hitherto admittedly neglected Sixth Object . This is nothing less than its effort to bring about better international understandings , not only through club contacts and correspondence , but through actual study of political and social problems abroad . Hence , the luckless members no longer practice their voices for merry noon songfests and denunciations of the local communists , but actually hone up on the political principles of fascism and the Mexican agrarian question to the point of being able to discuss these matters with almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again is it alleged that Babbitt is an intolerant apostle of standardization , yearning to pattern himself on some fair go-getting archtype and to cram the rest of society into the same mold ? Then watch Rotary 's editorial inspirers ? followed by hasty flurries of imitation among the journalists of similar organizations ? lead out their campaign for a bigger and more ardent individualism . Why the very plan of membership , it is proclaimed , this representation of all the known forms of commerce and the professions on the muster roll , is a symbol that the service clubs are the patrons of variety in human tastes and temperaments . If standardization has crept in here and there , it is a perversion of the principles of a fundamentally individualistic order . If the service clubs are to achieve their beneficent purposes insociety ? they still admit they have them ? they will do so , the Rotarian has recently discovered , never through the pressure of the mass , but through the distinctive actions of each member acting for himself . There are rifts , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last international convention of Rotary solemnly recommended by resolution that the American brotherhood obey the Volstead act and quit making humorous remarks about it . Nevertheless , it has become a dangerous time for a member to write in suggesting that the clubs take a firm and public stand even for such hitherto respectable objects as the home town 's moral and social improvement . The last gentleman to try this was painfully bombarded with letters informing him that it was not the purpose of Rotary to reform society . Finally , is the villain of the intellectual 's epic accused of self-righteousness , of a disposition to gloat ostentatiously over his virtuous achievements and to flaunt his glorious fellowship and peculiar folk ways a little too publicly and noisily ? If so , editorial and official persuasion now leads him as rapidly as possible toward quashing these indictments by penance and personal amendment . Again and again , he is warned by his mentors not to " tell the world how to do it . " In his international relations be is cautioned not to entertain the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . Of late he has read a graphic warning of the dangers latent in his former assumption that because President Bob 's administration provided Hometown with a bigger and better swimming pool , President Jim 's administration must carry on the precedent by providing it with a bigger and better brass band . Ile is being openly discouraged from seeking space in the newspapers for his accounts of his public benefactions and righteous resolutions . Hence , his local news space quota declines with the highest official blessings , and the reporters who formerly served the clubs as official press agents now have one more free luncheon hour a week ? to many a caustic city editor 's relief . Above all , Babbitt is being lectured on being more businesslike and restrained in his rituals of fellowship , less obvious and sophomoric . Thus the official organs tend more and more to boast that the last international convention was as quiet and serious as a bank directors ' meeting , that fellow hotel guests hardly knew a convention was on . In fact , so gloomy and restrained was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open letter that he missed his old-fashioned good time . He was promptly jumped on by members who accused him of lacking the " new spirit , " and evidently thought of him as lacking in decent maturity besides . IV Nevertheless , symptoms of the new yeasting are not predominantly journalistic . With a growing volubility , the vaguely thoughtful soldiers of the late army of standardization are beginning to talk the language of individualism as well as read it . In fact , it seems more probable that conversational disapproval of the standardization-urge produced the editorial abandonment of it , than that the literary leaders of Babbittry courageously and of their own accord instituted a crusade for a bigger and better nonconformity on which the gods of social transition now begin to smile . Into this obscure evolutionary change diverse factors appear to have entered . There were always in most communities a few business and professional person ages of some local eminence who stood apart from the open revels , the giddy publicity , and the violent conformity pressures of the organized boon-bearers and discreetly but persistently satirized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained suavely aloof ; and the ways of major magnates are everywhere worthy of prayerful observation . Of late years this body of patronizing dissent has tended rather rapidly to augment itself . Youths entering the business and professional world since the war , and brought up on the literature of protest rather than that of flattering approval , are openly cynical . Here and there a dribbling of disillusioned and resigned service club members spread the heresies ? alas , not infrequently , by means of small but choice burlesque organizations . Precisely while all this was going on , the worth of standardization judged by its sacred token , Results , began to be cast into doubt . Standardization had conferred , for example , the blessing of prohibition upon a de-individualized republic . But prohibition either did n't work and thus set up a backfire of lawless individualism horrifying to standardizers , or it did work and proved to the standardizers how drab and depressing their regime could be . Also , it was suddenly discovered that standardization could be something more than a convenient device for defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , and what good men and true should think about the flag and the labor problem . The Ku Klux Klan , the anti-evolution worldsavers , the labor unions , the farm bloc , half a hundred manifestly silly or oppressive reform movements suddenly began adapting the standardization technic to their own peculiar , and frequently annoying , uses . It suddenly grew clear to the more far-seeing Babbitts that standardization not only worked one way , did not even stop with working both ways , but could be made , with the help of zealots , legislators , and policemen to work almost any idiotic way . The danger of even the mildest and most beneficent form of fascism was seen to be that somebody might come along some fine morning with a symbolical whip in his hand and successfully " faseize " you . THE NEW Finally , along with the original glamorous confidence in the sure " Results " of standardization , there petered out also the more obvious motives for its soul-ofthe-nation-saving activities . After the war and its emotional hang-over were done with , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . After the Coolidge landslide had checked the late Senator La Follette 's timid advance toward black anarchy , it was not plausible to say that every righteous citizen must think , dress , and behave like the president of his Chamber of Commerce , or the republic would become prey to red revolution . The fundamentally sane apostles of standardization began to realize that the mere fact of their ever having cherished such assumptions made them slightly ridiculous . So quietly at first , but with hints of a gathering crescendo , began the conversational propaganda of de-standardization . One began to meet gentlemen , not critical outsiders but personages high in their various service orders , who gravely granted that the process of remaking the world in Mr. Babbitt 's fair image was " going too far . " One encountered scorn and ridicule for the cruder practitioners of the conformity codes ? the fine confidential superciliousness of the aristocratic Rotarians toward the imitative organizations ; the dismay and indignation of all the service clubs over the wanton eagerness of impetuous fundamentalists to enact religious standardization legally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics runs a note of half-humorous , half-shamed deprecation ? like that of the wives of a city 's first magnates who observe the ladies of the lower mystic orders imitating their fashions of dress and mannerisms a bit extremely and several months too late . If any sense of guilt underlay the new attitude , it must be relieved by the quick adoption of a scapegoat , and the scapegoat was found . During the war the four-minute patriotic orator became the epic hero of our rising fascism . For at least half a dozen years after his discharge from the military service he traded for prominence in the bolshevist menace , less subtly but hardly less magnificently than the estimable Mr. Coolidge himself . Now suddenly on the lips and publications of the men of service he becomes a by-word , almost a villain , the false prophet who has led the people astray into worship of the gilded calf of mere rhetoric . The periodicals devoted to a broadening of the Babbitt vision berate him as the " loud speaker " - 1926 American for the " false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open meeting . The serious-minded inform you in confidence that he does not accurately represent his organization 's genuine spirit . He bangs on to his glory only in the smaller metropolises of the backwoods . Elsewhere he has been demoted from office and its speechmaking perquisites . He is tolerated only as college juniors tolerate the classmate who can not rise above the fatuous enthusiasms of his early youth to his new and proper dignity . Hence , in any city within mental shooting range of the centers of sophistication , it is a fairly safe wager that President Al of Kiwanis cultivates the restraining suavity of a Harvard professor and that President Hal of the Rotary subscribes to The Nation . Moreover , the followers know this and are proud of it . Indeed , one of the symptoms of the new decadence is their eagerness to conciliate the critics by bragging about it . For example , an old friend , a loyal " organization man " from the corn belt , descended upon me recently , bursting with an account of how a district official of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been threats of a contest , and one of the declining breed of standardizers had hastened to the candidate to secure his pledge that , if elected , he would set a good example by pledging himself to observe and verbally respect the 18th amendment . " I 'll set a good example , your grandmother , " the candidate had replied tartly and in the hearing of an able group of gossip-spreaders . " Everybody knows Jim Jennings takes a drink when he wants it and is n't going to fall in love with the Vo'stead Act as long as there 's a good bootlegger left . In other words , Jim Jennings is himself , and if you elect him , you 're going to get himself on the job and not a phony imitation of a W. C. T. U. Chairman . " The news of this rebellion spread , the opposition collapsed . The ribald Mr. Jennings was unanimously elected , as my friend gleefully expressed it , " on the one hundred per cent Be Yourself ticket . " This , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One needs to have only the slightest local standing as a mocker , and the " organization men " of one 's acquaintance make haste since the first of last January to admit that much mockery is just . True , they blame it all on the new sociological villain , " the loud speaker . " He it was , they imprecate his all too recent memory , who made the novel Babbitt a short four years ago only too true . But he 's gone now , thank goodness , and grounds no longer exist why broad-minded citizens like the really up-and-coming service club men and their critics should not get together and agree that this is rapidly becoming the best of all possible worlds . As they talk on , this happy consciousness of their new liberalism swells almost to gloating . They flaunt their fine scorn of the go-getting systems which lately so intrigued them , declaring that their salesmanship is not a matter of mechanical technic but of making good with the customer in the most individualistic way you know how . They tell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate Mr. Sinclair Lewis on its platform , and gave it back to him ashot as they took , and in the same spirit-They prove their yearning for bigger and better sophistication by expatiating on the deep regret of the Chicago club , the mother of Rotary , that Mr. Mencken could not accept an invitation to address them . Mr. Mencken , I gather , declined on conscientious grounds , and so far as I know the transaction was private . Nevertheless , each Rotarian I have met during the past forty days repeats the edifying incident as though it were the choicest bit in his current folk poetry . Midway in all this , the magazines formerly devoted to the standardization cult , tuned in , and already their passion for the new individualism approaches the fervor of a crusade . Midway , too , a certain expression , not slang precisely , but carrying all the cheerful undertone of a genuine popular slogan , began its progress toward ultimate universality . I suspect that it arose out of the flapper 's demonic possession , which includes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for burlesquing even herself . However that may be , " Be yourself " is the charmed phrase which threatens to make the new decadence irresistible . When , as seems imminently probable , it becomes as common to the cigar vendor and the international butter and eggs convention as " do n't take any rubber nickels , " I fear that the conformity compulsions of Mr. Babbitt will be as dead as the tradesman 's humility of his great-grandsire . When , however , the new decadence reaches this exotic stage , the incurable optimist must believe that another school of social criticism will rise to face it . Time and the knocking instinct may be trusted to wither lunatic individualism into a new conformity with the same caustic breath with which criticism now threatens to wither madcap conformity into individualism . But in a land where the critic gets what he wants , with a bonus , social criticism must remain classed near the top of the hazardous occupations .                    @
