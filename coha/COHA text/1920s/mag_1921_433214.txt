Tars is a very nice view , is n't it ? ' ' the warden was speaking ? a tall broad-shouldered man in the early forties , with a rugged complexion , powerfully thick hands , and an open face with twinkling eyes . A self-made man , who bed risen from the rank of a guard to his present position of responsibility in one of the largest prisons in the country . He had taken me to the old prison , and pointed to the place on the wall where , twenty years before , he had started his career , pacing the wall with a rifle on his shoulder . He was proud of his newly won responsibility and conscious of it ? it was a new thing . We sat on the porch facing the prison . A broad , quiet river flowed by the house , with a distant range of low hillS , green and bright . It was a wonderful summer morning ! The sun barely rising above the tree-tops , the dew still glistening in the shade , the birds singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all gave the setting a cheerful atmosphere that filled every fibre with the love of life . In front of as was the prison ? long gray walls partly covered with ivy , the ground round about planted with flowers , and the green grass neatly kept . The sun , thriving the shadowed curtain of early dawn from the upper turrets of the inside building , made everything vibrant and happy . We were sitting in soft chairs , smoking our pipes , looking at the prison , and talking about its manifold problems . The warden was a very good fellow , kind-hearted and well-intentioned . He was , however , a man of no learning , almost illiterate . His whole training was the training he had received in the prison ; his equipment was that which the prison environment provided . A varied contact with many men who had come under his observation , combined with a natural exuberance and intelligence , with a background of good-will that had remarkably well escaped the corroding influence of the prison atmosphere , had given him a really unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been trained under the greatest of prison men , and considered himself a good disciple . These men can only be treated in one way ? that is , strict and steady discipline . Always be just to the men , but punish them quick and sharp when they break the rules . ' This completed his philosophy of life ? strictness , justness , treat all men alike , and let punishment follow the breaking of a rule as the night follows the day ? without exception , without fuss , constant and inevitable . He liked to talk about himself , his experiences , the men he had met , the characters he had handled , and was proud beyond words that the men considered him square . ' We sped the rising sun into the upper sky by exchanging stories and adventures . Once , years ago , he had visited New York City , and the marvel of it still dwelt with him . He told me how he had been taken down the subway , had watched the crowds on Broadway , and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in front of the Stock Exchange . The tall buildings impressed bins , and the rumbling Elevated ; but , most of all , the crowded East Side . I did n't tell My wife and children half that I saw , because they would n't have believed MO anyway ; and would you think that people would live like a lot of pigs , when they could come out hero in the open and free West ? But man is a funny creature , ai n't he ? and there is no explaining ' him . ' It was Sunday , and chapel-time came . He turned us ? my wife and me ? over to the assistant warden , with instructions to take us to chapel . The assistant warden was a smaller man , stocky , a little gray , quiet , answering questions in monosyllables , and watchful . As the gates swung open , we followed him into the prison . This is one of the new structures , a model of the Auburn type ? probably the best of its kind in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings , the halls , the brass , the marble floor ? all looked shiny . It would have been difficult to find a speck of dust . In answer to a question , the assistant warden said , We make ' ens spruce ' er up . ' The halls wore strangely silent . We could hear the echo of our steps go rumbling down the line . Nothing was visible but an occasional guard in his blue uniform and yellow buttons , standing in a corner , and saluting with Iris club as we went by . The chapel , a half-circular room with something like fifteen hundred seats , was empty when we walked in and seated ourselves in the last row , the assistant warden standing at our back . Thu stained windows with their steel bars , the gray walls , heavy and barren , gave the whole chapel a sombre and dull setting . After a few silent and restless moments , a door opened . The assistant warden nodded his head , and a second later a brazen gong struck upon the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tramp of a thousand prison feet , marching on us from all sides . They came down four aisles ? in single dressed in gray suits , their heads bare , their arms folded , shoulders stooping , bodies bent a little forward as if they were falling into the chapel rather than walking , eyes to the ground and faces turning neither to the right nor to the left . There was a listless weariness about these spiritless men , a kind of hopeless resignation , an acceptance of an unrelenting fate and a broken submission , that made the metaphor of ' being broken on the wheel ' seem a real , stalking , ghost-like apparition . About every twenty feet a guard in blue uniform and Sunday suit , with shoes nice and shiny , and armed with a heavy loaded cane , kept company . As they reached the end of the aisle , the guard struck the marble floor with his loaded ' butt , ' and the linen turned half around , and filed in front of their seats . He struck the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front the stick , and this sound seated the men . This continued row after row , until all the men were in their scats . When the doors were closed , the guards placed at their proper distances , facing the men , with their sticks in front of them , another rap on the ground and the hands of the men dropped to their sides . In all this time not a head had been turned , not a sound , not a whisper , not a word , nothing ? not even a verbal command ? had escaped the thousand men in the room . Nothing but the tramping , shuffling feet , the iron clang against the marble floor ? and the stooping forms dressed in gray . A few minutes later , a signal from the watchful master of ceremonies at our back , and a side door on the stage opened . A man dressed in black was ushered on to the platform . He was a little man , bald-headed , with thick eyeglasses and a red puggy face . As he crept across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , pulled out a yellow paper folded many times , and began to ? open it . He placed the paper on the speaker 's desk in front of the platform , pulled out a red handkerchief , mopped his face , cleaned and adjusted his thick glasses , hemmed and coughed a few times , stuck the paper against his nose , and began to read . He had a thin , squeaking voice , which did not reach half across the room . It is difficult to describe the setting and the bearing of the spiritual leader of this silent and subdued flock without seeming unkind and ungenerous . I write without prejudice and without bias ? but one must tell the truth . He was an ignorant man . He stumbled over the big words , would get half-way through them , only to turn back for another start . There was nothing inspiring about him , nothing cheerful , nothing interesting . It was dull , stupid , insipid . The men could not hear what he read as he read to himself , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole performance lasted some fifteen minutes , including a few prayers ; and then the little man on the platform folded his yellow paper and scuttled off through the side door . // ? As the door closed , the first sound of the keeper 's stick against the marble floor roused the noon in the last row . They stood up , folded their arms , faced half-about and began to shuffle out , followed by the next row and the next , and so until the end . Each movement was determined by the sound of the keeper 's stick . As they canoe out , we got a better look at the men . Most of them were young and tall , broad of shoulder and well built ? men reared in the West , on farms , who had come into the cities and been dragged into the whirlpool of undercurrents that brought them to prison . Their faces were gray , their eyes sunken , dim , drill , and moody . As they noticed us sitting in the last row , their eyes shifted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors to be seen downstairs in the chapel , ? but hastily , fearfully , their eyes turned to the ground again when they noticed the little silent and grins figure at our back . The tramp , tramp , tramp of the men could be heard as they crept down the distant hails . Silence fell upon the chapel ? a hard silence , a feeling of horror , suppression , and distortion pervaded the air and filled it with something of infinite sadness . I turned my head to look at my wife , and the tears were running down her cheeks ? tears that would not be controlled . When the last sound had died down , a keeper appeared at one of the doors , nodded his head , and the guardian at our back said , ' We can go now . ' I asked if the men load to attend chapel . He said , Yes , prayers is good for them . ' I have been haunted by the chapel service . Never before had I seen anything quite so humiliating , inhuman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , I have seen others more cheerful , less grim ? places where laughter and applause could be heard , where prayers were intermingled with other things . I have seen services where there was some eloquence and a manly voice ; but this picture is typical of the spiritual stagnation in prison . It is typical of the order and the discipline in prison ? of the system , regularity , formalism , and , too frequently , of the silence . There is no spiritual life in the average American prison . There is no hope , no inspiration , no stimulus , no compulsion of the soul to better things . It is hard , cold , frozen , dead . This is so true , so general , so all-pervading , that one might describe the whole prison system in these few words ? and I say this after seeing something like seventy penal institutions this summer . The little Ford engine labored mightily as we barely climbed the steep hill to the State Reformatory at Y ? . As the car reached the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a mile away , a massive building with many towers , surrounded by most beautiful grounds . An uninitiated person would have taken this for some strange mediceval castle magically transplanted to this most favored spot , set off against many hills , with a clear blue sky above and mile upon mile of smiling rich fertile farm-lands below . This , however , was no castle of an ancient knight ? it was the stony home of many a. poor lad who had been placed there for the good of his soul and the safety of the community . This , at least , is what the kindly people would have said . This was a reformatory to make bad boys good . As I rang the bell and presented my credentials to the keeper , he looked at use doubtfully . ' Whom do you want ? ' said he , with the sharpness of a rasped temper . ' The warden , ' said I. ' The warden is busy . ' ' Yes , I know he is busy ; but as I shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take these in to him now . ' After a while I was presented to the warden ? a tall , bony , straight-barked old man , of about sixty-five or seven iv ; gray , thin-lipped , sullen , and obviously displeased . As I came in , he motioned me to a chair and then turned suddenly on me . Pointing a long sharp finger in my face , he said : ' I know you . You are from one of them damned reform committees who believe in coddling the prisoners . Well , I do n't . I have been in this business forty years , and know what I am talking about . You ca n't coddle these fellows ? you ca n't do it . Let me tell you . I do n't like these sniffling committees that come around and investigate ? that come around and tell a man like me , who has been in this business forty years , how to run his prison . It is just like telling a general how to run his army . But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown the sum total of nothing . But in his blustering way , he told me everything I wanted to know . I have nothing to hide . I treat the men right ; they can learn a trade , and if they are willing workers , they can earn some money ? and work is good for them . This is not a bad prison . Men who are here from other prisons always tell me this is better than most . But I run this prison . No rough-neck can come here and think he is going to rough-house it . If he tries to , I fix him . I fix him . This is my job . A little while ago they transferred a fellow in here who said that this place was like a kindergarten , and that he would show everybody how to eat out of his hand . Well , I fixed him . He started by getting into a fight with one of my officers . I took him out into the yard , put him over a barrel , stripped him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane to him ? I have a good birch cane . I fixed him good and fine . No hones broken , no rough stuff , no permanent marks . It will wear off in good lime . And when I had given him plenty , I riveted a seventy-pound ball and chain round his ankle and put him lack in the shop from which he came . It did n't take long , only a little longer than it does to tell . But I fixed him . Ile has been a good dog ever since . ' The warden stopped ; his face relaxed a little , he looked at me as if he were well pleased , wiped his thin lips with the back of his hand , reflected a minute , and then said , ' Would you N. , . Neve it ? I told this story to a bunch of women the other day when they asked me to speak , and they hissed me for it . ' Be was sincerely perplexed , and naively thought that the women must either have been ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . This story brings me straight to the question of prison discipline in the United States , There has been so much agitation about this particular question , ? and it is a crucial question , ? that a survey of how things stand at present is bound to be of interest as well as significant . I must begin by saying that the agitation has mainly bees outside of prison ? that those affected by it were mostly people who have little or nothing to do with the prison situation . There are a few- exceptions , it few indications that all the agitation has not been entirely in vain : a few changes in method , a possible reduction in the number of men punished , a relaxing of the rules a little in regard to talking and the lock-step , the abolition of such things as the strait-jacket ( I am not so sure about this : rumors of as existence reached me in more than one place , but I did not actually see it ) , and the abolition of what was once a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging their bodies off the floor . Let me introduce into this discussion of the situation the following quotation from the Detroit News of January 27 , 1920 : ' Harry L. Hulburt , warden of the prison , explained to the committee how the flogging apparatus is worked . The man to be flogged is blindfolded , handcuffed , and shackled at the ankles . Then he is stretched out on a long ladder , which is made to fit snugly over a barrel . The prisoner is blindfolded , the warden said , so that he will not see who is flogging him . The wardens told rise , when I visited the institution , that he did it himself , as he thought that no one else should be allowed to do it . His back is bared and a piece of stout linen cloth is placed over the bare spot . The instrument used in the paddling is a heavy strap about four inches in width , punched with small holes about an inch apart and fastened to a handle . The strap is soaked in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Dr. Robert McGregor one of the best and most conscientious prison doctors that I met on the trip , prison physician , holds the pulse of the loan being flogged and gives the signal for the flogger to stop . ' The article then goes on to detail three different cases of flogging . We will quote only the first . Thomas Shultz , boy of twenty-one years old , seven months after being sent from the insane asylum , was given 181 lashes and kept in the dungeon during the period of the flogging for nine days and fed on bread and water . . . . Nov. 3 , assaulted guard . For this and other minor offenses , none of them serious , he was sentenced to receive 181 lashes . Nov. 4 , he received 40 lashes . . Nov. 5 , he received 35 lashes . Nov. 6 , he received 28 lashes . Nov. 9 , he received 40 lashes . Nov. 13 , he received 40 lashes . Total , 181 lashes . ' Now Jackson , to which this refers , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word good ; but there are no good prisons , any more than there are good diseases ) . If I were asked to pick the least objectionable prisons in the United States , after seeing something like seventy , I should have to include Jackson among the first ten , or possibly even among the first half-dozen . The warden is unusually intelligent , interested in his job , an advocate of the honor system , who also practises it on a large scale . He is certainly among the most humane of the wardens in the country ; and , by and large , his prisoners have more freedom inside the walls than is common . I do not repeat this quotation to give it extra publicity . I repeat it to show what happens even in those prisons which are least antiquarian and hide-bound . This does not mean that all prisons have whipping . A large number still do , ? more than I expected , ? but old methods of punishment are still prevalent in practically all prisons . There is hardly a prison where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement is for a few months , in some cases for a few years ; and in not a few there is such a thing as permanent solitary . Some prisons have a few men put away ; some have as many as twenty ; and in one case there are about fifty men placed in solitary for shorter or longer periods . Why do the ward6ls do it ? Well , they do not know what else to do . They run to the end of their ingenuity , and do that as a last resort ? that is , the best of them . Some do it as a matter of common policy . I recall climbing a flight of stairs with a good-natured warden in a Western prison , and being shown a specially built courtyard with some dozen solitary cells . There were four men put away there permanently ? one had been there for three yaws . They were not even allowed to exercise . They were not allowed to talk , they had no reading-matter , they could not smoke . There had at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warden permitted him to smoke ; but when the others were put in , he told him not to pass any tobacco to them . This is , of course , an impossible demand . The insistence for a share of that mighty joy in solitary ? a smoke ? is irresistible . He did what was inevitable , ? passed his tobacco and a ' puff , ' to the other fellows , ? and the warden deprived him of the privilege . ' He should have obeyed what I told him if he wanted to hold on to his privilege , ' we , the reason given . What is true of solitary confinement is true also of the dark cell . Practically all prisons have and use dark cells . It is common to find from one to a dozen men put away in the dark cells , kept on bread and water ? that means a little bread and about a gill of water every twenty-four hours . In MOM prisons ? about ninety per cent . ? t his punishment is added to by hawkeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door during the clay , that is , for a period of ten to twelve hours each day that he is in punishment ? the time varying from a few days to more than two weeks . In some institutions the handcuffs have been abolished and replaced by an iron cage made to fit the human form , which , in some cases , can be extended or contracted by the turning of a handle . A man put in the dark cell has this cage placed about hint and made to fit his particular form ? and it is usually made so ' snug ' that he has to stand straight up in the cage . Ile can not bend his knees , he can not lean against the bars , he can not turn round ; his hands are held tight against the sides of his body , and he stands straight , bike a post , for a full day , on a little bread and water ? and for as many days as the warden or the deputy sees be I was always asked to observe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , a dark , pitch-black cell , with your hands pinned against your sides , your feet straight all day , unable to move or shift your ground , for ten and twelve hours a day , on bread and water , is the reform ! In one or two institutions where the cage is used , but is not adjustable , ? the man having to squeeze into the flat space as best he can , ? they added the handcuffs . In one institution , ? a commendable institution , as such things go , in some ways , ? in one of the states that has always prided itself on being progressive , I found that they added to the dark cell the handcuffing of the man while he slept . In the particular institution I have in mind the arrangement was as follows . A bar was attached to one of the walls , and slanted down until it reached within about three inches of the floor . On this bar was a ring . At night , the board on which the man slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcuffs was put on the prisoner 's wrists , another pair connected with his hands was attached to the ring on the slanting iron bar . This means that he had to lie on one side all night long , handcuffed and pressing on this board , which served him as a bed . This does not complete the list of prison punishments as they are now practised . The underground cell is still in existence ? probably not in many prisons , but I saw it in at least two different institutions . In one state prism : , ? an old prison , dark and damp inside , ? I found a punishment cell in the cell-block . It was built underground . In the centre of the hall there LS an iron door , flat on the ground , which one lifts sideways ? like an old-type country cellar-door . It creaks on its rusty iron hinges . I climbed down a narrow flight of rickety stairs . When I got to the bottom , I had to bend double to creep into a long narrow passage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty tin covering . It was not high enough to stand up in , hardly high enough for a good-sized man to sit up in . The warden above closed the door on me . I was in an absolutely pitch-black hole ? long , narrow , damp , unventilated , dirty ( there must be rats and vermin in it ) ; and one has to keep a bucket for toilet purposes in that little black hole . As I came out , the warden said naively , When I put a man in here , I keep him thirty days . ' Let the reader imagine what that means to human flesh and blood . I do not want to make this a paper of horrors . Just one more case . On my way back I stopped off at a certain very well-known prison that I had heard about since childhood . For the last ten years it has been famous as one of the great reform prisons of the country . I remember seeing pictures of the warden with prisoners out on a road-gang . The article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom these men had ? they guarded themselves away from the prison proper , out in the hills , building roads . The state in which this prison is situated has constructed many miles of prison-built road ? and in fact it was one of the first in the country to undertake to build roads with convict labor , without guards . When I knocked on its gates , I thrilled with expectancy . Here , at least , would I find a model prison , unique , exceptional , a pride to the state and an honor to the man who was responsible for it . In fact , I had heard that the warden was being considered for political advancement to the office of governor because of his remarkable prison record . I found a remarkable institution ? remarkable for its backwardness and brutality . The first thing that I saw as I entered the prison yard was a strange and unbelievable thing . Nine men kept going round in a circle , wheeling wheelbarrows , while a heavy chain dangled from each man 's ankle . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy iron ball attached to the chain . In the centre stood a guard ; and the men kept circling about him all day long , wheeling the iron ball in their barrows , their bodies bent over , their faces sullen , their feet dragging . They did that for ninety days each , I was told by my guide . At night they carried the ball to their cells , and in the morning they carried it to the dining-room . For three months this iron ball and chain stayed riveted about their ankles ? a constant companion and , I suppose , from the warden 's point of view , a stimulus to better things ? oneof the ways of making bad ' men good . ' There , too , I found all the other characteristics of the average prison ? dark cells , bread and water , solitary , handcuffs , and , in addition , a hired colored man to do whipping when that was called for ? as no one else could be got to do it . This negro was never permitted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The report that I sent to the National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor , for which I was traveling , reads as follows : ? I have just visited the famous reform prison at C and this is what I found : ? Nine men going around a circle , wheeling ball and chain . Whipping-post , with special colored man to do the task . Dark cells . Solitary . Men handcuffed to the doors . Bread and water . No work for the siren . In addition to loss of privileges and good time , which is usual as a means of discipline . A traveling prison chaplain had visited the institution the Sunday before I came , and made a speech to aloe noon . In beginning his speech , he remarked upon the fame of the warden with the world abroad , and upon the fortune of the men for being under such humane treatment . Some of the men hissed . For that the moving-picture machine had been torn out from its place in the chapel , and the men were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told also that Sunday yard-privileges had been rescinded . In telling me about it , one of the guards remarked : We will show them the prisoners ! that this can be a real prison . ' I wonder what they think it is now ? and what else they can add to make it one . Let this conclude the description of current disciplinary methods . IV The use of man by man is the basic test in the evaluation of any institution , especially one designed to make the bad " good , ' the hard " soft , ' and the unsocial " social . ' The test of 0 penal institution is its disciplinary methods . The picture I have drawn is one-sided and not sufficiently comprehensive . If one desires to secure a general view of the technique of penal administration as it is at present practised , he must look at other elements of the picture . There is the problem of labor . The opportunity to keep busy during the day , ? to do something that will hasten the passing hours , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , that will exercise one 's fingers and use one 's body , ? this simple craving of the human organism is denied on a much larger scale than one can int unless he is actually brought in eontart with the fact . I should say that at least one third of the prisoners in the American state prisons are unemployed . That means that in some prisons all men are working , in some practically none , and in others only a part . The warden was an aggressive , opinionated , ignorant , and coarse individual . He had grown stout , his lower lip had hardened , his jaw jammed against his upper teeth as he talked , and at every second sentence he banged the table for emphasis , stopped , looked at you to see if you agreed with him , and if there was any doubt in his mind about this , he repeated what he had said , adding , am talking straight fact . ' I first saw him in the evening , swinging in a soft hanging rocker on the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immaculate white suit , with a silk handkerchief in his con-pocket , and smoking a big cigar tilted at the proper politician 's ' angle . Ile was round-headed , his face shiny and smooth-shaven . I felt uncomfortable sitting there in front of him and talking about the men inside . A feeling of disgust crept over me , as if he were some fat ever-dressed pig ? and self-assertive . ' I run this prison by psychology ; if you want a lecture on psychology I will give it to you ; it is all in psychology , ' he told me . I begged to be excused that night . I was tired . I had driven all day ; and perhaps I would enjoy it better after I saw how he managed the prison . ' All right ; but remember the whole trick is psychology ? it is as simple as that . ' It was a typical prison ? only it had an Idle-house . ' The ' idle-house ' is so called because it houses the idle men ? men who do nothing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , every day of the week , every week of the year , and every year of their prison term ? a term that may range from one year to a lifetime . It is a large bare loft . There I found four hundred men , dressed in their prison suits , sitting , all facing one way . Around the room there were keepers , seated on high stools , watching these idle men . In the morning after breakfast the men were marched to this idle-house . At noon they were taken to the dining-room ; after lunch they were marched back to the idle-house . They were being made good by sitting . This is better than in some prisons , where the men who have nothing to do are kept in their cells . And yet ? how little ingenuity it would have taken to put most of these men to work at something useful , if not remunerative . It would not have been difficult to find enough public-spirited citizens who would have provided a dozen old and broken-down automobiles and typewriters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them apart and putting them together ? learning something and keeping busy , doing something . It would not have been difficult to put a number of these to studying Spanish , French , Italian ? every large prison has men who would like to teach these languages and others who would like to learn them . There are a hundred ways in which these men could ? at least , most of them could ? have been occupied in doing something : learning how to draw , to box , to play an instrument , to typewrite ? anything that would have taken the burden of eternal idleness off their hands . All it needed was a couple of days ' use of the imagination . But the warden lacked the imagination . He was not really vividly conscious of the problem . When I had seen the prison and was ready to go , I asked him if he would give me that lecture on psychology , and he said with an emphatic bang on the table , My boy , psychology is common sense . ' What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no imagination in the American prison field ? or so little that one has to look far and wide to find it . Take the question of housing . Practically all American prisons are built on the same plan . That is the Auburn type . The best way to describe it is to begin from the outside . The first thing is the high stone wall . After you get into the prison yard made by this wall you come face to face with a large square building about five stories high . It has narrow windows , heavily barred ? in some cases these windows are so narrow that it would not be possible for a mars to get through them . When you enter the stone building , you find another building inside . This inside building is the cell-block , a square stone structure standing four stories high . Each tier , or floor , is divided into a large number of little cells ? each cell looks like every other . Each floor is like the one below it . The cells vary in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most of the prisons are old ? the cells are about three and a half feet wide , seven feet long , and seven feet high . Some , as in Sing Sing prison , are even smaller . In the newer prisons they are larger ? in some cases more than twice this size . The cells are set back to back . The space of a cell is so small that it is inconceivable for one who has not been in it . You can not spread your hands , you can not lift your hand above your head , you can not take more than three steps without hitting your toe against the wall . A cell is not larger than a good-sized grave stood on end . It is dark , half-dark , all the time . There is no window in the cell . The windows are in the outer wall and the cell is set about thirty feet away from the outer wall . The windows in this wall are generally narrow , and are always heavily barred . The sun must first get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the cell is not made to receive the sun . In tire older prisons one half of the front facing the window is walled up . The other half has a door . In the very worst prisons , this door is completely closed at the bottom ? that is , the lower half is made of solid steel . To get around this , as in Situ Sing , they have drilled holes in that part . The upper half is closely netted with heavy bars , in some cases leasing only little square holes for the sun and air to get through after it finds its war into the prison . In the older cell-blocks these cells have no internal ventilation at all ! All the air must come in and out through the limited space of the front door . In others , more modern , there is a ventilator in the cell ? a hole grin ; up through the wall , about six hides square . In all the old prisons the cells have no toilet system ; buckets are used for toilet purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mar can get his own back ; but not always . As the men are put into their cells at about five in the afternoon , and taken out again at about six in the next morn . ing they are in this cell-block for at least thirteen hours . Think of what it means to have eighteen hundred Merl in a prison under such conditions . Think of a hot July night , and picture the air on the top tier . No words can describe the pollution of the air under these conditions . Add to this the fact that , in most prisons , the man are kept in practically all day Sunday . half a day Saturday , and , if Monday happens to be a holiday , all day Monday , and you will have a sense of the torture that life under these conditions imposes upon the sensitive , and of the callousness it implies in those who hoot ceased to be sensitive . This , however , is not all . The prison ' can not be kept clean , ? certainly not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ought to heclone . These old stone structures , standing in half-darkness for a hundred years , never having proper ventilation , never ) ( I airing , are infected with bugs pro ! o. and vermin . In my own case ? and this is typical of the old prison ? the old cell-block in Blackwell 's Island was beg-ridden . In my day there were thousands of bugs in my cell . I struggled valiantly , constantly , and industriously . But it was a hopeless fight . I had sonic books , and the bugs made nests in them . They crept over me when I slept ? they made life miserable . I am not blaming the warden for this . I am describing a fact that We might as well face . But the sense of sanitation is not very keen among prisa 11 officials taken as a whole . There are a few exceptions , mostly in the new prisons . The meaning of cell-life under these conditions can not be conceived . I recall the clay when I was first put in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls seemed drawn together , and I halted at the door . A little yellow half-burned bulb was stuck up in the corner ; there was a narrow iron cot against the wall . I heard the door be , hind me slam , and I felt myself cramped for space , for air , for movement . I turned quickly after the retreating officer , and called him back . What do you want ? ' Will ? will I have to stay in this place all night ? ' He laughed . ' You will get used to it soon enough . ' I turned back to my cell . The walls slowly retreated and made more room for me , so that I crept in and away from the door . The yellow glimmering light hurt my eyes . It was fully half an hour before I adjusted myself to the fact that I was there for the night . On my little narrow iron cot , I found two dirty blankets . I rolled them up , shoved them against the wall beneath the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . When I came into the prison that morning , I had some books , but they were taken away . I protested that I had to have something to read ? I simply had to have something . The keeper objected that it was against the rules . He looked at my books carefully , and then picked out a little paper-covered volume , which he gave me with the remark , ' You can have this . We permit men to bring in anything that is religious . ' It was William Morris 's News from Nowhere . The little glimmering light on the yellow page , and in a few minutes I was off in dreamland ? I followed Morris 's idyllic picture and perfect beings into a world where there were no prisons and no unemployed . This happy setting was interrupted by the sobs of a boy next to my cell ? he too was a newcomer . He sobbed hysterically , ' My God , what shall I do ? What shall I do ? ' I climbed clown from my cot , knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to him . But he paid no attention to me . He just sobbed and cried like a child torn from its mother , as if his heart would break . Finding no response , I clambered back to my place , and was soon off in dreamland again . I did not wake until the lights were turned out at nine o'clock . I looked out of my cell and saw , through the far-off window in the outer wall , a star glimmering ; then , without undressing , straightening my blankets , I fell asleep and , in my sleep , dreamed of the free fields of early childhood . I mentioned the dirty blankets on the cot . I used that word deliberately . It is not uncommon for the blankets which a man gets in prison to be dirty . They are rarely cleaned or fumigated . One man goes out and another goes in ? receiving the blankets the other used , without any attempt to clean or wash them ; and of course there are no sheets . I have seen blankets so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you moved them . This is not true of all prisons , but is of many . It is not uncommon to find a prison where the men have not their own individual underwear . The underwear is sent to the laundry , and a man gets what luck will bring him ; some is too long , some too short ; some has been used by healthy men , some by men who were sick with contagious diseases . In some prisons the email cells have two men to a cell . There.are two cots , one above the other ; and these men live in this narrow cramped place ? and at times the health of the men so crowded is not examined . They use the same bucket and drink out of the same cup . Practically none of the prisons pay the men for their work . A few places make it possible for a few men to earn what might be considered a fair wage , but the mass of the prisoners earn little , in many cases nothing . Just at random : New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; California and Ma Ma , chusetts pay them nothing . And yet , it is asked why the men are not interested and ambitious ! Practically none of the prisons make a serious attempt to educate their prisoners . The eight grades for illiterates are in use in places ? but as a rule they amount to little , both the system and the method being antiquated and the spirit poor . In only one or two places is there a real attempt to use for educational purposes the extraordinary advantages of time and control which prisons imply . San Quentin is conspicuous by the fact that it is making a real attempt in that direction . What I have said about education is Ante of health . Health is neglected . Here and there the fact that crime and health , both physical and mental , have a relation to each other , is gradually being recognized , but not as much or as fully as one would expect . This rather sketchy description of American penal conditions is unfair to the exceptions ? but the exceptions arc few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , in so far as I have seen them , that does not fall into this general picture in one or more of its phases . Of the worst prisons , all that I have said is true . Of the better ones , some of the things I have said are true . For the casual visitor , who is taken around by a guard or by the warden , who is told all the good things and not permitted to see the bad ones , whom lack of experience and knowledge makes gullible , this may seem a startling story . If it is startling , it is not more so than the facts are . There are other things about the prison ? developments of parole , education , self-government , farm-labor ? which are more hopeful than the picture painted here . These , however , must be left over for another time . I have separated the hopeful things in he prison situation from the outstanding shortcomings , deliberately . To combine them is to give the optimist ? and we are all ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to rationalize and escape the burden of present evil . The present prison system is bad . I have hardly described all its evils . Some can not be written about without greater finesse and literary subtlety than I possess . Others were hidden from me . There are indications of a possible way out , of better things , of more hopeful use of human intelligence ; but to data all of these are negligible and limited , even if a significant contribution to penal methods .
