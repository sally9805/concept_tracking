txt When the stock market has advanced to heights undreamed , over a period of more than four years , showing individual advances measurable In the hundreds with an average advance of over two hundred points In the Industrials of the Dow-Jones average and seventy points in the Railroads , a decline , on a weighted average , of ten points in a single day may not be so formidable as it looks . Such a decline is equivalent to no more than two points at an average price of 60 although the weighting of the Industrial average makes a difference With this premise it can still be said that ' Thursday 's break in the stock market conveyed a warning . It says much for its intrinsic strength that the market did not get out of hand even with a large public margin account open . Traders have grown used to wide fluctuations even if for a time they have all been one way . For the sensible observer the comment would be not that the decline was severe but rather that it should have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many years ' experience that everybody 's judgment is not so good as somebody 's . There is obviously , and has been for some time past , an enormous amount of money in the country available for speculation , even irrespective of the New York call money market . We are still in a period of high prosperity , perhaps somewhat unevenly distributed , and with high wages considerably more general . It is sometimes claimed , on entirely insufficient evidence , that this represents what the worker would in the old unregenerate days have spent upon liquor . But high wages must have been greatly influenced by Immigration restriction , keeping down the supply of labor , and mass production largely based upon individual efficiency . In an economic sense wages are not high relatively to per capita production . It may be that the rich are growing richer , as the Socialists say , but it is certain that they are not growing richer at the expense of the poor , or of those with relatively modest means . The average income compares favorably with the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in manufacturing prosperity because our domestic markets are largely based upon the consumer of moderate means . The Wall Street millionaire does not buy radio sets , furniture or even motor cars on the instalment plan . But admitting all this latent strength in the general situation it was time to call a halt in speculative activities because of their unsettling effect when they have extended out of Wall Street into every considerable town or city in the country . The people who have been active in the stock market , pyramiding their speculative position in the usual way , are . for the most part those with affairs of their own which should not be neglected or minimized. ft is not everybody who is built for successful speculation but it takes a check in a great bull market to disclose , that important fact , There is nothing said here on the barometrical indication of the averages because it is altogether too soon to draw useful inferences . To be hoped reported improvement of ventilation , in Congress ' Chambers will include that of Ideas .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
