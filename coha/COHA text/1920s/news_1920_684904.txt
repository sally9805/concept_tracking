txt Declaring that the Democratic Party could not go before the country in the Presidential elections to defend the failure of the Democratic minority in the Senate to effect a compromise with .. the Republican majority on the treaty and the League of Nations , William Jennings Bryan came forward again last night as the champion of immediate ratification and as an individual Demo , crat outlining proposals for the settlement of grave domestic problems . Speaking trom rouge notes and not from a prepared manuscript , the man who has thrice been an unsuccessful candidate for the Presidency asserted his belief that no campaign speaker could go before any audience in the country with the treaty Its an issue and defend the position of the Democratic Party in the Senate . The occasion was a dinner given in his honor in the Hotel Astor by the Society of Arts and Sciences . In the first part of his speech uprm the treaty and the League of Nations he used almost word for word the text of his prepared speech delivered at the Jackson Day dinner in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehemence and eloquence that made the name of the Commoner famous over the world , he launched into an extemporaneous amplification of his views that held his audience in their seats for more than an hour . So tense was the interest that only at rare intervals did the 1,500 members of the society burst into applause . When he sat down the applause was thunderous . He pointed out that the treaty and the League of Nations had been accepted by the European nations , although many of their statesmen had criticised some of its provisions , and that while " anarchy and Bolshevism is beginning on the other side we are silent and do n't help . " Calls Treaty Delay " a Disgrace . " " It is a shame , an outrage and a disgrace on our kind of Government , and we ca n't allow it to last . " he asserted in this part of his speech , dealing with his premise that the delay in the Senate made it appear that it was more difficult for a democracy to settle a war and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another delay of fourteen months , the time necessary for an appeal to the voters through elections , Mr. Bryan said that he " loved his party too well to allow it to commit this crime " of delaying the treaty for another such period . He pointed out that . it was extremely difficult to foresee whether , at the end ' of that time , either party would be able to come to a decision in the treaty without compromise because no one could foresee what would be the politics of the next Senate . One-third of the Senators would retire , he said , and no great swing of votes to either side would be sufficient to settle the treaty issue in the Senate without some compromise . Former Ambassador Gerard , Introducing Mr. Bryan , referred to the fact that the Commoner had vigorously supported the fight for equal rights for women , and he had also urged the enactment of welfare laws for minors . He referred to Mr. Bryan 's work in connection with the so-called " Bryan treaties . " When Mr. Bryan arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech earlier in Brooklyn he remarked that the dinner last night , which he said was a sort of surprise to him , gave him " an opportunity to speak in New York on subjects I thought I would have to pass by this time . " He ocapmended the political attitude of Senator Owen and former Governor Folk , and also paid tribute to the work of Mr. Gerard while Ambassador in Berlin . " I am glad to welcome the entrance of woman into the political arena , " said Mr. Bryan , " for she enters that arena at a time when she is needed most . My friends , great issues are ' impending . Ju : as the great liquor trust , with its corrupting influence , retires from the po- litical arena , woman , the greatest force for righteousness , , enters it . Her in the future will be tremendous . " I want to take up some of the questions ' before the country , and I do not want to speak as a partisan , for I do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party above my country . I think that the individual should think for himself , and- the citizen , without . office , is sometimes more free to express his opinions than those who are in official posts . I am in this class . " Then , referring to the Jackson Day dinner in Washington and the President's. letter that was issued on the eve of Mr. Bryan 's speech there , he continued : " I do n't think- that the President , had he known my speech , would have changed his letter . " - Then , - in the pause that succeeded the laughter , he went on , " And I do n't think that I would have changed my speech . I wbuld n't belong to a party that prevented one from expressing an opinion on ? a great issue . " The man who talks about a split between the President and a man , because they happen to disagree on methods . but agree in - purpose , is more in ' terested in partisanship than anything else . The way to find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 the President . He is not in a position to say what his reservations are . He . made the treaty . I stood with the Democrats who stoutly opposed reservations , and I believe that I ' made as many speeches against reservation as any man in the country . " . Commends President 's Treaty . The speaker then outlined the great scope of the treaty 's effect once it was in force , and continued : " I believe that the President got a better treaty than any one had a right to expect . We were in a different position at the Peace Conference than the other nations . They had suffered more . Why , if they had added up all of the things they had lost through the war the total of all Germany 's credits would not have compensated them . " It was perfectly natural that they should ask for all that they could get . Our attitude was different . We sought nothing material out of the peace compact ; our only thought was to make future wars impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations and I repeat that he brought back a treaty better than any one " had reason to expect . " My position from the outset was that any changes that might be needed in the treaty or the League might better be made after beth , were in force . The treaty was n't perfect , but it - was the best that could be obtained . That was the attitude of these in favor of the treaty in the Senate , but we were defeated ; we did not have a majority in the Senate . " I think , " he continued , with increased earnestness , " that it is incomparably better that a compromise should be reached by both parties that will result in ratification . That will take . the treaty out of politics . I would like to have the treaty ratified by a big majority  --  that would have a great effect abroad . 1 am also hopeful that sentiment from without will coerce raised his voice ? " the Senate into compromise and ratification . Tlig.t is what I want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free than some Senators . I have had people differ with me for so long that I would feel uncomfortable if I found myself any thing but a minority . Opposes Fourteen Months ' Delay . " I do not think that the Democratic Party can go before the country carrying the burden for fourteen months ' delay to the Peace Treaty . I did not want the party to hide behind a provision of the Constitution "  --  a reference to the . three-quarters of the Senate in agreement claim ? " to filibuster for fourteen months while the world waits . I would not defend the right of a minority to block the will of the majority . " My faith in popular government does not depend on the people wanting what I want ; I believe in the popular government of what the people . want . The three-quarters provision refers to war , and God forbid that it should be more difficult to get out of- a wa ? , than to get into one . " Then , as to the differences down in Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I learned in conege was that heat expands things . I think the heated debaees down in Washington may have expanded things : " Referring to the preanmie offered by the Republicans , and the chances that it would inspire foreign nations to make demands on their own behalf , he said : " I think that the Republicans must concede the . withdrawal of that reservation . I do not doubt that when the time comes they will drop that preamble . I think that we have very much , exaggerate the importance of Article X. I think that we must get togethe , r and get the outside influence to vloek and break the shell that surrounds that section of the treaty . Why , some of our People talk as if changing Article X. would destroy the treaty . This talk is not big enough to base a campaign on . . ? " These are some of the things they 've quarreled about down in Washington . I do n't think they are big enough to base a campaign on . What the people want- is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We 'll take it to the people , ' and the other side says ' Go ahead . ' That Is a fine attitude to take with the world on fire . " Nobody who takes the map and studies it doubts that neither party is going to get three-quarters of the members of the next Senate . There are only one-third going out , and there are States which the Republicans wo n't get , and there are States which the Democrats ca n't possibly carry . My friends . I love My party too well to be silent when there ? is danger of its committing this crime . " ' ? " apparently an allusion to continued delay on the treaty ? " and love my , country too well , to remain silent when it overlooks this unprecedented opportunity . " It is a shame , " he went on , " an- outrage , a disgrace that we ca n't get together and settle this . ' We ca n't permit . the thrusting of this issue into the next campaign to the confusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' lie Denounces Profiteering . " Take profiteering . My friends , I think that the darkest blot on this war was conscienceless profiteering . Profiteering going on while our boys were over there bleeding , profiteering at home bleeding the people . The bleeding overseas halted , bet , the bleeding here has continued . " He told of instances of profiteering that he personally had heard about , told of the number of millionaires that had been created out of the war , and then , digressing to the coal strike , asserted that the coal operators had made " tremendous " profits and had held firm when the miners sought their increases . " We must give the people the machinery to protect themselves from profiteers , " he continued . " The Government says to the average citizen , ' You ca n't use violence , no matter what this man has done to you . ' And the Government by this statement assumes a solemn obligation to protect that man . But , may I. ask , where are the courts , the tribunals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that there ought to be established in every city , town and village trade commissions to deal with ' this matter . " Another great issue is the ' question of the suppression of free speech . I think ' that every man has a right to express himself , no matter whether one agrees with him or not . The man who advocates , however , the overthrow of the Government by force  --  there is not a spot under this flag for him . These are questions that ca n't afford to wait while we talk about the treaty for four- , ! teen months . " There is , then , the great issue private ownership , or monopoly , and Government ownership . I think that wherever there is a question about competition being impossible ? I think it ' ought to be Government owned , The progress from private ownership to Government ownership has been steady and consistent . Says Monopolies Are Messing . " ' Wherever the people have taken charge , they have demonstrated that they can reduce the price and give better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monoply  --  they extort . they rob and they corrupt politics . Today we have all the great private monopolies massing for one great assault on the right of the people to attend to their own affairs , their own business . " Mr. Bryan bitterly condemned the advertising campaigns of some industries , and declared : ' Whenever there is a fight between a great franchise holding corporation and the people , the people 's side is n't heard . " Now , these are questions that must be heard . I recognize the embarrassment of presenting a case like this to an audience like this . But , you must remember that this audience is n't the American people  --  the American people also includes farmers and workers . " But these are things that I feel I must speak about . 1 will join with you to destroy the man who seeks the destruction of this country by force , and I want you to join with me to destroy the man who seeks to destroy this country by money . I believe that the plutocrat carries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mosquito carry the germ of yellow fever . " ? Turning then to " another great issue , " Mr. Bryan put forth the initiative and referendum . He enumerated the States that had embraced the doctrine and declared his belief that the mass of people wanted it . He thought that this matter also should- , be thrested out 1- , the forthcoming campaign . Owen for Political Amnesty . ' Another speaker who pleaded foe an immediate settlement of the issue was Senator Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma . who called an informal conference of the Senators from his party three days after ' the Jackson Day dinner in the hope that some plan for a compeernise with the Republicans might be evolved . He spoke also in favor of the wiping out of old war animosities , of amnesty for certain political prisoners , and criticised certain bills before Congress which , he said , were framed to eradicate sedition and anarcny nut might be used by some men in official life for the stripping-away of some of the liberties of the American people . ? JarnesW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency , reiterated his remark made at the Jackson Day dinner that some settlement of the treaty ought to be made at once and that " whoever keeps peace from the world  --  the responsibility is his . " Joseph W. Folk , ex-Governor of Missouri . asserted his opinion that " the treaty should be Americanized by reservations and then promptly ratified . " One of the guests at the dinner was Homer S. Cummings . the Democratic National Chairman , who jokingly protested as he came into the hall that lie should not be assigned to'a place at the same table with Mr : Bryan and a Presidential possibility such . as Mr. Gerard lest too great an ' official air be given to the function . He sat at one of the tables not on the dais , although , one of the places at , the long speakers ' table was occupied by William F. McCombs , the former National Democratic Chairman . On Mr. Bryant right sat Mayor Mylan , and others at the table include . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present city administration . Eleven seats from Mayor Hylan sat his inveterate foe , Public Service Commissioner . Lewis Nixon . The presence of Mayor Hylan and Commissioner Nixon at the same table caused some comment in view of their verbal exchanges upon traction problems .
