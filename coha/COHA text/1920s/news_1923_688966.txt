txt Two decisions of national interest were rendered by the Supreme Court Monday . In 1915 , when the du Pont Powder Company of New Jersey was reorganized as the du Pont Powder Company of Delaware , Mr. ALFRED I. Du PoNT received some 75,000 shares of the common stock of the new company . In his income return for 1915 , and his amended return , he did n't reckon the new shares as taxable income . The Supreme Court decided in the case of another stockholder , to whom had been issued two shares of the new company for one of the old , that this transaction was a distribution to stockholders of past profits on the capital of the original company and the income taxable . After an investigation of more than two years , on Dec. 31 , 1919 ; the Government assessed Mr. du PONT for an income tax of $1,575,000 on the Delaware shares . He contended Viat , since his 1915 return was filed before March 15 , 1916 , the three-year period for additional assessments was over . On that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on income under the law he filed a claim in abatement . The Commissioner of Internal Revenue having denied his claim , Mr. DU Porer obtained in the District Court an injunction restraining the Government from collecting the assessment . The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the injunction . The Supreme Court now reverses the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and directs the District Court to dissolve the Injunction . Can the Government be enjoined from collecting a Federal tax ? No. says the court ; a Federal statute forbids the maintenance of a . suit for such restraint . Both in regard to customs duties and internal revenue taxes , the Government has the right , and the courts have sustained it , to lay down the conditions of its submission to judicial decision in the collection of its revenue . Mr. DU PONT took the wrong remedy . He is directed to pay the additional assessment . He might have paid It at once , filed his claim for abatement , sued in tee Court of Claims for recovery , as ether stockholders of the two companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment " until his right to sue it back ex " pired , make a case so extraordinar ? ? ily and entirely exceptional " as to escape the prohibition in the Federal statute of suits to restrain the assessment or collection of any tax . Has he no remedy ? Yes . He is " given ? the right now to pay the tax and sue to recover it back , and in such " a suit to raise the question as to the ? value of the stock and the amount " of the resulting tax and also the bar ' ? of time against the assessment ? which he attempted to raise in the " bill of complaint . " In the case of the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company of Missouri , the court held . Justice BRANDEIS and Justice HOLM ES dissenting , that in the regulation of public utility rates the " present costs " of labor , material , and so on , must be considered . Rates that will give a fai , r return upon me property ca n't be ascertained without consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it . Ls not the owner nor the general manager of public utilities .. In short , the Supreme Court holds in regard to public service property as in regard to railway property that valuations mush conform with current costs of  --  -- comstruction , or reproduction . - Thus , - confiscatory rates will not he auSitainet by the . Supreme Court , it least the present Supreme Court .
