WITH LAWRENCE IN ARABIA-Lowell Thomas-Century ( $4.00 ) . This is an age when romantic adventure is supposed to be dead . Yet , not ten years ago , Thomas E. Lawrence , young Oxford graduate , archeologist and poet , entered Arabia on leave from irksome military duties in Cairo and left that country some years later-the " uncrowned King of Arabia . " For sheer romanticism , coupled with history-making events , surrounded by names which moved the whole world not so long ago , the story that Mr. Thomas has written about Arabia and Colonel Lawrence has not been surpassed during the present century . <P> At a time when recent events have shaken Arabia from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf ( see THE HEJAZ ) , the publication of this book can not alone be described as apposite , but as an extremely useful exposition of Arabia 's fight for independence which brings the reader virtually to the door of yesterday 's events .                   @ @
