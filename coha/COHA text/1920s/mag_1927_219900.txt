The grand old Duke of York He had ten thousand men . He marched them up a hill one day Then he marched them down again . <P> CHORUS <P> And when they were up they were up ! And when they were down they were down ! But when they were only half way up , hey were neither up nor down ! <P> Major General John Duncan , Commander of the British expeditionary forces at Shanghai ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) shrewdly ordered , last week , a maneuver similar to that of the great Duke of York in the above nursery chanty . General Duncan saw that something must be done to impress the Northern Chinese in Shanghai and the Southern Chinese who are trying to capture it with the idea that Britain has a real army in China , will soon have 30,000 men at or near Shanghai , and means to protect her interests permanently. * How could all this be better said to Chinese than by a parade of British might ? Soon General Duncan ordered 1,100 British troops to parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Two days later the statesmanship of U. S. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg assumedly prompted Vice Admiral Clarence S. Williams , commanding the U. S. forces at Shanghai , to imitate the British parade , though in more cautious fashion . Twelve hundred U. S. marines marched , but they did not venture beyond the international city . None the less Chinese knew this meant that the U. S. is standing with Britain in the present crisis . <P> Along the Chinese battlefront west of Shanghai all was suspiciously quiet last week .

Simultaneously the Southern generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek launched a swift attack to cut the Shanghai-Nanking railway at Soochow . The fall of Soochow ( reported but unconfirmed ) would cut off the Northern armies of the " two great Changs " + from hastening to defend Shanghai and leave the Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cantonese .
