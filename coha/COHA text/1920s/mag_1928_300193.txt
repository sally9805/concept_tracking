A slender , sparkling woman came down the gangplank of the S. S. Paris a fortnight ago , said a few fast greetings in French and moved down the pier to the luggage space allotted those whose names began with A. There were 22 trunks to be passed on , trunks filled with costumes which were white and ruffled , sleek and black , cloudy and lacey : trunks for gay mantillas , for red and green and golden slippers . Even customs officers looked their awe . Such colors , such stuffs were rare . Such charm was rare too , but at the moment no commensurate assurance swelled the breast of the sparkling creature . To be sure she was La Argentina , the Spanish dancer* who as a child was premire danseuse classique at the Royal Opera in Madrid , as a mature artist the rage of Berlin , of Paris . But the U. S. was different . Her art was subtle , its lines tickling , fine . The U. S. might not understand . . . . <P> Last week La Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusky curtain for her background , Pianist Carmencita Perez , billed as soloist of the Royal Spanish Court , to make her music . Pianist Perez played first but the evening began with the clicking of castanets in the wings and the gliding entrance of La Argentina . She was tired and languorous as the sun that used to warm her ; she was glittering and remote ; she was a primitive thing driving away evil spirits to the fire music made from de Falla 's Amor Brujo , snapping her fingers , clucking her tongue ; a comic spirit cavorting on a peasant 's holiday . She danced without accompaniment , was herself the musician , playing a busy bass with her heels while her castanets turned the tune of a Seguidillas . <P> Like all great musicians her flawless technique seemed almost beneath notice . Her personality had absorbed it and it was that consummate artistry that made a blase audience break into cheers , demand encore after encore . Musical critics have scant use for dancers . La Argentina turned the tables , sent them fairly scampering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a Kreisler . <P> <P> * Born Antonia Merce , in Buenos Aires , of a Castilian father and an Andalusian mother . Her father was premier danseur in the Madrid Opera ballet in which she herself made her debut at 9 . <P> +Hailed as her U. S. debut but technically incorrect . Some 12 years ago , when she was much less of an artist , La Argentina gave a few matinee recitals , had small notice .
