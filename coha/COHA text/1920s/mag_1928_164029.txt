Melted Wax <P> Thirty years ago , rural visitors to Manhattan were careful to see the Eden Muse which , like Madame Tussaud's* in London and the Grvin in Paris , was a gallery of wax statues . The collection was at that time situated on 23rd Street ; of late years , its patronage lessened but not destroyed , the Eden Muse has been located on Coney Island . <P> Last week a fire started in the Eden Muse . It began burning near Charlie Chaplin 's effigy ; the sad and funny little man subsided mournfully into smoking grease . The flames leaped from figure to figure , stroking their oily faces with a hot and magic hand . Before long , all the ugly famous criminals , the sly and silent actresses , the solemn , musty presidents and the fake policemen stationed to fool visitors-all these people with their stiff faces and their blind , secretive eyes , sharing also with their no less sly , no less secretive models the total inability to escape destruction , became puddles or streams of burning wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frail knife which he had held so long in a poised and useless threat . All this frail company of famous people dwindled , slipped , leaned and perished into a huge and hungry flame . The owner of the Eden Muse , one Gumpertz , was away in the South . Firemen came , the manager 's 16-year old daughter , Lillian Seeger , pleaded with them and stared and cried . The fire went on burning ; nobody could stop it . <P> <P> Fat Woman <P> In Jamaica , L. I. , one Mrs. Florence Schlenbaum , weight 580 lbs. , appeared in court . She was charged with leaning against Mrs. Katherine Link , a neighbor , " She called me a large , fat , red-hot mamma . . . in the heat of the moment , perhaps I did get too close to her . . . " said Mrs. Schlenbaum and paid a fine of $25 . Then she waddled slowly away , accompanied by her sister , Anna , weight 576 lbs . <P> Miller 's Misfortune <P> In Dahlonega , Ga. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the clock on his mantelpiece had stopped going round . Mr. Miller pulled out his watch so that he might set the stopped clock . In doing so he pulled out $120 which fell to the hearth and began to burn . Mr. Miller dropped his clock key thereby breaking his clock spring in his haste to get water to extinguish his burning money . When he got the water and poured it on the fire , the steam which arose scalded Mr. Miller 's child . Mr. Miller 's money was completely burnt up . <P> Poor Hantz <P> In York , Pa. , one Joseph Hantz , bum , was arrested for trespassing . Hearing of this arrest , L. D. Hantz , Assemblyman , no relative but proud of the name of Hantz , went to court to plead for Joseph . When his pleas were successful , proud Assemblyman Hantz gave slouching Bum Hantz the price of his fine together with a oneway ticket to Washington , D. C. <P> <P> * Madame Tussaud 's wax works partially burned up in March 1925.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
