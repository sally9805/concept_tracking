SCENE : A darkened room . After a moment the door opens , admitting a streak of light . A man peers in cautiously . As soon as he is sure that the room is unoccupied , he steps inside and feels along the wall until he finds the switch which floods the room with light . He is dressed in impeccable taste  --  evidently a man of culture . From time to time he bites appreciatively on a ham sandwich as he looks about him , apparently viewing the room for the first time . Nothing pleases him until a vase over the mantel catches his eye . He picks it up , looks at the bottom , puts it down hard , and mutters , " Imitation . " Other articles receive the same disdainful verdict . The whole room is beneath his notice . He starts to sit down before the fire and enjoy his sandwich . Suddenly he pauses to listen , looks about him hurriedly for some place to hide , thinks better of it , and takes his stand opposite the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman enters with a man at her heels . As she sees the thief she stifles a scream and retreats , backing the man out behind her . The thief smiles and waits . Soon the door opens again , and the man enters with the woman clinging to him . They stand opposite the thief and stare at him , not sure what they ought to say or do . THE THIEF pleasantly . Good evening ! Pause . Good evening , good evening . You surprised me . Ca n't say I expected you home so soon . Was the play an awful bore ? Pause . We-e-ell , ca n't one of you speak . I CAN carry on a conversation alone , but the question-and-answer method is usually preferred . If one of you will ask me how I do , we might get a step farther . p. 3 CLARA breathlessly . You  --  you  --  With growing conviction . You 're a thief ! THE THIEF Exactly . And you , madame ? The mistress of the house , I presume . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to catch the first ? CLARA This  --  this is OUR house . Charles , why do n't you do something ? Do n't stand there like a  --  Make him go away ! Tell him he must n't take anything . Advancing toward the thief and speaking all in one sentence . What have you taken ? Give it to me instantly . How dare you ! Charles , take it away from him . CHARLES apparently not afraid , a little amused , but uncertain what to do , finally adopting the bullying tone . I say , old man , you 'd better clear out . We 've come home . You know you ca n't  --  come now , give it up . Be sensible . I do n't want to use force  --  THE THIEF I do n't want you to . CHARLES If you 've got anything of ours  --  We are n't helpless , you know . He starts to draw something black and shiny from his overcoat pocket . It might be a pistol , but he does not reveal its shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them here . Takes them from the uncertain Charles . Perhaps they 're better than mine . Fine cases . Tries them . Humph ! Window glass ! Take them back . You 're not armed , you know . I threw your revolver down the cold-air shaft . Never carry one myself  --  in business hours . Yours was in the bottom of your bureau drawer . Bad shape , those bureau drawers were in . Nice and neat on top ; rat 's nest below . Shows up your character in great shape , old man . Always tell your man by his bureau drawers . Did n't it ever occur to you that a thief might drop in on you some night ? What would he think of you ? p. 4 CHARLES I do n't think  --  THE THIEF You should . I said to myself when I opened that drawer : " They put up a great surface , but they 're shams . Probably streak that runs through everything they do . " You ought to begin with real neatness . This other sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Talking to US about honesty  --  in our house ! THE THIEF Just the place for honesty . Begin at home . Let 's  --  CLARA Charles , I wo n't stand this ? Grab hold of him . Search him . You hold him . I 'll telephone . THE THIEF You ca n't . CLARA You 've cut the wires . THE THIEF Did n't have to . Your telephone service has been cut off by the company . I found that out before I came . I suspect you neglected the bill . You ought not to , makes no end of trouble . Inconvenienced me this evening . Better get it put in right away . CLARA Charles , do I have to stand here and be insulted ? THE THIEF Sit down . Wo n't you , please ! This is your last ham-sandwich , so I ca n't offer you any , but there 's plenty of beer in the cellar , if you care for it . I do n't recommend it , but perhaps you 're used to it . p. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him preach to us all night ! I wo n't have it . Being lectured by a thief ! CHARLES You ca n't stop a man 's talking , my dear , especially this sort of man . Ca n't you see he 's a born preacher ? Old man , while advice is going round , let me tell you that you 've missed your calling . Why do n't you go in for reform ? Ought to go big . CLARA Oh , Charles ! Do n't talk to him . You 're a good deal bigger than he is . THE THIEF Maybe I 'll jiu-jitsu him . CLARA He 's insulting you now , Charles . Please try . I 'll hold his feet . THE THIEF No doubt you would . But that would n't stop my talking . You 'd be taking an unfair advantage , too ; I could n't kick a lady , could I ? Besides , there are two of you . You leave it to Charles and me . Let 's have fair play , at least . CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIEF Ple-e-ase , do n't screech ! My head aches and your voice pierces so . Let 's sit down quietly and discuss the situation like well-bred people , and when we 've come to some understanding , I 'll go . CLARA Yes , after you 've taken everything in the house and criticized everything else you ca n't take , our manners and our morals . p. 6 CHARLES But he is n't taking anything now , is he ? Let the poor chap criticize , ca n't you ? I do n't suppose he often meets his  --  er  --  customers socially . He 's just dying for a good old visit . Lonesome profession , is n't it , old man ? CLARA If you WO N'T do anything . I 'll call the neighbors . THE THIEF No neighbors to call . Nearest one a block away , and he is n't at home . That comes of living in a fashionable suburb . Do n't believe you can afford it , either . WO N'T you sit down , madame ? I ca n't till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , and I 've been on my feet all day . It 's hardly considerate plaintively . I do n't talk so well on my feet , either . It will take me much longer this way . Clara bounces into a chair , meaningfully . Thank you , that 's better sighs with relief as he sinks into the easy chair . I knew I could appeal to your better nature . Have a cigarette ? Charles accepts one from his beautiful case . And you , madame ? CLARA puts out her hand , but withdraws it quickly . Thank you , I do n't care to smoke  --  with a thief . THE THIEF Right . Better not smoke , anyway . I 'm so old-fashioned , I hate to see women smoke . None of the women in my family do it . Perhaps we 're too conventional  --  p. 7 CLARA I do n't know that I care to be like the women of your family . I will have one , if you please . No doubt you get them from a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was  --  his case . Exquisite taste . Seen this case often , I suppose ? He eyes them closely . Great friends ? Or perhaps you do n't move in the same circles . Clara glares at him . Pardon me . Tactless of me , but how could I guess ? Well , here 's your chance to get acquainted with his cigarettes . Will you have one now ? CLARA I do n't receive stolen goods . THE THIEF That 's a little hard on Charles , is n't it ? He seems to be enjoying his . CHARLES Bully cigarette . Hempsted 's a connoisseur . Truth is  --  we do n't know the Hempsteds . They 've never called . THE THIEF That 's right , Charles . Tell the truth and shame with a jerk of his head toward Clara  --  you know who . CLARA Charles , there is n't any reason , I 'm sure  --  THE THIEF Quietly , please . Remember my head . I 'm sorry , but I must decline to discuss your social prospects with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should all enjoy it . There is n't time for that . Let 's get down to business . The question we 've got to decide and decide very quickly is , What would you like to have me take ? p. 8 CLARA aghast . What would we  --  what would we like to have you take ? Why  --  why  --  you ca n't take anything now ; we 're here . Of all the nerve ! What would we like  --  THE THIEF It gains by repetition , does n't it ? CHARLES You 've got me , old man . You 'll have to come again . I may be slow , but I do n't for the moment see the necessity for your taking anything . THE THIEF I was afraid of this . I 'll have to begin farther back . Look here now , just suppose I go away and do n't take anything with an air of triumph . How would you like that ? CHARLES Suits me to a " T. " How about you , my dear ? Think you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be sarcastic . You 're too big . Only women and little men should be sarcastic . Besides , it is n't fair to me , when I 'm trying to help you . Here am I , trying to get you out of a mighty ticklish situation , and you go and get funny . It is n't right . CHARLES Beg pardon , old man . Try us in words of one syllable . You see this is a new situation for us . But we 're anxious to learn . THE THIEF Listen , then . See if you can follow this . Now there 's nothing in your house that I want ; nothing that I could for a moment contemplate keeping without a good deal of pain to myself . p. 9 CLARA We 're trying to spare you . But if you care to know , we had the advice of Elsie de Wolfe . THE THIEF wonderingly . Elsie de Wolfe ? Elsie , how could you ! Now , if you had asked me to guess , I should have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning any of this bric-a-brac myself . But it must be done . Here am I offering to burden myself with something I do n't want , would n't keep for worlds , and could n't sell . Growing a little oratorical . Why do I do this ? CHARLES Yes , why do you ? CLARA Hush , Charles ; it 's a rhetorical question ; he wants to answer it himself . THE THIEF I do it to accommodate you . Must I be even plainer ? Imagine that I go away , refusing to take anything in spite of your protests . Imagine it 's tomorrow . The police and the reporters have caught wind of the story . Something has been taken from every house in Sargent Road  --  except one . The nature of the articles shows that the thief is a man of rare discrimination . To be quite frank  --  a connoisseur . CLARA A connoisseur of what ? Humph ! THE THIEF And a connoisseur of such judgment that to have him pass your Rubens by is to cast doubt upon its authenticity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from the Hempsteds  --  Clara leans forward , all interest.  --  but that would take too long . She leans back . The public immediately asks , Why did the thief take nothing from 2819 Sargent Road ? The answer is too obvious : There is nothing worth taking at 2819 Sargent Road . p. 10 CHARLES comprehendingly . Um-hu-m ! THE THIEF The public laughs . Worse still , the neighbors laugh . What becomes of social pretensions after that ? It 's a serious thing , laughter is . It puts anybody 's case out of court . And it 's a serious thing to have a thief pass you by . People have been socially marooned for less than that . Have I made myself clear ? Are you ready for the question ? What would you like to have me take ? CHARLES Now , old man , I say that 's neat . Sure you are n't a lawyer ? THE THIEF I have studied the law  --  but not from that side . CLARA It 's all bosh . Why could n't we claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had ? THE THIEF solemnly . That 's the most shameless proposal I 've ever heard . Yes , you could lie about it . I ca n't conceal from you what I think of your moral standards . CHARLES I ca n't imagine you concealing anything unpleasant . CLARA It 's no worse than  --  THE THIEF Your moral sense is blunted . But I ca n't attend to that now . Think of this : Suppose , as I said , I should take nothing and you should publish that bare-faced lie , and then I should get caught . Would I shield you ? Never . Or suppose I should n't get caught . Has no one entered your house since you have been here ? Does n't your maid know what you have ? Can you trust her not to talk ? No , no , it is n't worth the risk . It is n't even common sense , to say nothing of the moral aspects of the case . Why do people never stop to think of the practical advantages of having things stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 brooch and it 's immediately worth $15 . The longer it stays lost , the more diamonds it had in it , until she prays God every night that it wo n't be found . Look at the advertising she gets out of it . And does she learn anything from it ? Never . Let a harmless thief appear in her room and she yells like a hyena instead of saying to him , like a sensible woman : " Hands up ; I 've got you right where I want you ; you take those imitation pearls off my dresser and get to hell out of here . If I ever see you or those pearls around here again , I 'll hand you over to the police . " That 's what she ought to say . It 's the chance of her life . But unless she 's an actress , she misses it absolutely . A thief does n't expect gratitude , but it seems to me he might at least expect understanding and intelligent coperation . Here are you facing disgrace , and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get ? Sarcasm , cheap sarcasm ! p. 11 CHARLES I beg your pardon , old man . I 'm truly sorry . You 're just too advanced for us . Clara , there 's an idea in it . What do you think ? CLARA It has its possibilities . Now if he 'll let me choose  --  Is n't there a joker in it somewhere ? Let me think . We might let you have something . What do you want ? THE THIEF indignantly . What do I want ? I  --  do n't want  --  anything . Ca n't you see that ? The question is , What do you want me to have ? And please be a little considerate . Do n't ask me to take the pianola or the ice-box . Ca n't you make up your minds ? Let me help you . Have n't you got some old wedding gifts ? Everybody has . Regular white elephants , yet you do n't dare get rid of them for fear the donors will come to see you and miss them . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is write : " Dear Maude and Fred : Last night our house was broken into , and of course the first thing that was taken was that lovely Roycroft chair you gave us . " Or choose what you like . Here 's opportunity knocking at your door . Make it something ugly as you please , but something genuine . I hate sham . CLARA Charles , it 's our chance . There 's that lovely , hand-carved  --  THE THIEF Stop ! I saw it shuddering . It has the marks of the machine all over it . Not that . I ca n't take that . p. 12 CLARA Beggars should n't be  --  THE THIEF Where 's my coat ? That settles it . CLARA Oh , do n't go ! I did n't mean it . Honestly I did n't . It just slipped out . You must n't leave us like this  --  THE THIEF I do n't have to put up with such  --  CLARA Oh , please stay , and take something ! Have n't we anything you want ? Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that wo n't do any good . Talk to him  --  CHARLES Do n't be so sensitive , old man . She did n't mean it . You know how those old sayings slip out  --  just say themselves . She only called you a little beggar anyway . You ought to hear what she calls me sometimes . THE THIEF I do n't want to . I 'm not her husband . And I do n't believe she does it in the same way , either . But I 'm not going to be mean about this . I 'll give you another chance . Trot out your curios . CHARLES How about this ? Old luster set of Clara 's grandmother 's . I 'm no judge of such things myself , but if you could use it , take it . Granddad gave it to her when they were sweethearts , did n't he , Clara ? THE THIEF That ! Old luster ? That jug wo n't be four years old its next birthday . Do n't lay such things to your grandmother . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $3.98 for it , they saw you coming . p. 13 CLARA You do n't know anything about it . You 're just trying to humiliate us because you know you have the upper hand . THE THIEF All right . Go ahead . Take your own risks . CLARA There 's this Sheffield tray ? THE THIEF No . CHARLES Do you like Wedgewood ? THE THIEF Yes , where is it ? Looks at it . No . CLARA This darling hawthorne vase  --  THE THIEF Please take it away . It is n't hawthorne . CHARLES I suppose Cloisonn  --  THE THIEF If they were any of them what you call them . But they are n't . CHARLES Well , if you 'd consider burnt wood . That 's a genuine burn . THE THIEF Nothing short of cremation would do it justice . Of course I 've got to take one of them , if they 're all you 've got . But honestly , there is n't one genuine thing in this house , except Charles  --  and  --  and the ham sandwich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would treasure this as I do . It 's very dear to me . It 's grandmother  --  p. 14 THE THIEF suspiciously . Grandmother again ? CLARA As a little girl . Painted on ivory . See that quaint old coral necklace . And those adorable yellow curls . And the pink circle comb . Would you like it ? THE THIEF Trying to appeal to my sympathy . I 've a good notion to take it to punish you . I wonder if it IS your grandmother . There is n't the slightest family resemblance . Look here !  --  it is !  --  it 's a copy of the Selby miniature ! Woman , do you know who that IS ? It 's Harriet Beecher Stowe at twelve . What have you done with my overcoat ? CHARLES I give up . Here it is . Clara , that was too bad . CLARA I wanted to see if he 'd know . CHARLES There 's no use trying to save us after this . We 'll just have to bear the disgrace . THE THIEF Charles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old daub for YOU . Give it to me . CHARLES Wait a minute . You wo n't have to . Say , Clara , where is that old picture of Cousin Paul ? It 's just as bad as it pretends to be , if genuineness is all you want . THE THIEF suspiciously . Who is Cousin Paul ? Do n't try to ring in Daniel Webster on me. p. 15 CHARLES Cousin of mine . Lives on a farm near Madison , Wisconsin . THE THIEF You do n't claim the picture is by Sargent or Whistler ? CLARA It could n't be  --  THE THIEF ignoring her pointedly . Do you , Charles ? CHARLES Certainly not . It 's a water color of the purest water , and almost a speaking likeness . THE THIEF I 'll take Cousin Paul . Probably he has human interest . CHARLES That 's the last thing I should have thought of in connection with Cousin Paul . THE THIEF Bring him , but wrapped , please . My courage might fail me if I saw him face to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE THIEF While Charles is wrapping up the picture , I want to know how you got back so early . Your maid said you were going to the Garrick . CLARA We told her so . But we went to the moving pictures . THE THIEF You ought not to go to the movies . It will destroy your literary taste and weaken your minds . CLARA I do n't care for them myself , but Charles wo n't see anything else . p. 16 THE THIEF You ought to make him Men only go to the theater anyway because their wives take them . They 'd rather stay at home or play billiards . You have a chance right there . Charles will go where you take him . By and by he will begin to like it . Now to-night there was a Granville Barker show at the Garrick , and you went to the movies to see a woman whose idea of cuteness is to act as if she had a case of arrested mental development . CHARLES entering , doing up picture . Silly old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons when I 'm not here , and then drags me off again in the evening . Here 's your picture , as soon as I get it tied up . Ca n't tell you how grateful we are . Shall we make it unanimous , Clara ? CLARA I have n't the vote , you know . Clumsy ! give me the picture . THE THIEF Do n't try to thank me . If you 'll give up this shamming I 'll feel repaid for my time and trouble looking at watch . By Jove ! it 's far too much time . I must make tracks this minute . I 'll feel repaid if you 'll take my advice about the theater for one thing , and  --  why do n't you bundle all this imitation junk together and sell it and get one genuine good thing ? Clara leaves , apparently for more string . CHARLES Who 'd buy them ? p. 17 THE THIEF There must be other people in the world with taste as infallibly bad as yours . CHARLES Call that honest ? THE THIEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as relics . You could n't in the first place , except to a home for the aged and indigent blind . But I know a man who needs them . They 'd rejoice his heart . They 'd be things of beauty to him . I wish I could help you pick out something with your money . But I do n't dare risk seeing you again . CLARA rentering , with the picture tied . Why not ? There 's honor among thieves . THE THIEF There is . If you were thieves , I 'd know just how far to trust you . Now , I 'd be willing to trust Charles as man to man . Gentleman 's agreement . But looking at ClaraI do n't know  --  CHARLES Clara is just as honest as we are  --  with her own class . But your profession puts you outside the pale with her ; you 're her natural enemy . You have n't any rights . But you 've been a liberal education for us both . THE THIEF I 've been liberal . You meet me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I  --  I 've waited too long . Here I 've stood talking  --  p. 18 CHARLES Well , stop it now , ca n't you ? I do n't see how you 've ever got anywhere . Hide ! THE THIEF No , it ca n't be done . If you 'll play fair , I 'm safe enough here in this room , safer than anywhere else . Pretend I 'm a friend of yours . You will ? Gentleman 's agreement ? He shakes hands with Charles . CHARLES Gentleman 's agreement . My word of honor . CLARA offers her hand as Charles starts for the door . Gentleman 's agreement , but only in this . I have n't forgiven you for what you 've said . If I ever get you in a tight place  --  look out . THE THIEF taking her hand . Do n't tell more than one necessary lie . It 's so easy to get started in that sort of thing . Stick to it that I 'm a friend of the family and that I 've been spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try to stick to that . But ca n't I improvise a little ? It 's such fun ! THE THIEF Not a bit . Not one little white lie . CHARLES entering with a young man behind him . It 's a man from the News . He says he was out here on another story and he 's got a big scoop . There 's been some artistic burglary in the neighborhood and he 's run onto it . I told him we had n't lost anything and that we do n't want to get into the papers ; but he wants us to answer a few questions . p. 19 REPORTER Please do . I need some stuff about the neighborhood . CLARA I do n't know , Charles , but that it 's our duty . She smiles wickedly at the thief . Something we say may help catch the thieves . Perhaps we owe it to law and order . REPORTER That 's right . Would you object if I used your name ? Charles and the thief motion to Clara to keep still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic signals , and sails serenely on . CLARA I do n't know that we should mind if you mention us nicely . Will the Hempsteds be in ? I sha n't mind it , if they do n't . REPORTER Good for you . Now , have you  --  CLARA We have missed something . We have n't had time to look thoroughly , but we do know that one of our pictures is gone . The men are motioning to her , but she goes on sweetly . REPORTER A-a-ah ! Valuable picture . He has n't taken anything that was n't best of its class . Remarkable chap . Must be the same one that rifled the Pierpont collection of illuminated manuscripts . Culled the finest pieces without a mistake . THE THIEF interested . He made one big mistake . He  --  stops short . p. 20 REPORTER Know the Pierponts ? THE THIEF Er  --  ye-es . I 've been in their house . Retires from the conversation . Clara smiles . REPORTER Well , believe me , if he 's taken anything , your reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master , I suppose ? CLARA A family portrait . We treasured it for that . Associations , you know . REPORTER Must have been valuable , all right . Depend on him to know . He does n't run away with any junk . Who was the artist ? CLARA We do n't know  --  definitely . REPORTER Never heard it attributed to anybody ? CLARA We do n't care to make any point of such things . But there have been people who have thought  --  it was not  --  a  --  a Gilbert Stuart . CHARLES Clara ! CLARA I do n't know much about such things myself . But our friend nods toward the thief , Mr.  --  Mr. Hibbard  --  who has some reputation as a collector , has always said that it was  --  not . In spite of that fact , he had offered to take it off our hands . CHARLES Clara , you 're going too far  --  p. 21 REPORTER She 's quite right . You 're wrong , Mr. Hibbard . You may be good , but this fellow KNOWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking was good . This fellow never sells . Of course he ca n't exhibit . Just loves beautiful things . No , sir , it was real . THE THIEF between his teeth . It was n't . Of all the  --  CLARA smiling . You take your beating so ungracefully , Mr. Hibbard . The case , you see , is all against you . THE THIEF Be careful . The picture may be found at any minute . Do n't go too far . CLARA I hardly think it will be found unless the thief is caught . And I have such perfect confidence in his good sense that I do n't expect that . REPORTER Lots of time for a getaway . When was he here ? CLARA He was gone when we came from the theater . But we must almost have caught him . Some of our finest things were gathered together here on the table ready for his flight . How he must have hated to leave them , all the miniatures and the cloisonn . I almost feel sorry for him . CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Garrick for the Granville Barker show . Mr. Hibbard took us she smiles sweetly at him . I 'm devoted to the best in drama and I always insist that Charles and Mr. Hibbard shall take me only to the finest things . And now we come home to find our  --  you 're sure it was a Gilbert Stuart ?  --  gone . p. 22 THE THIEF I 've got to be getting out of here ! Ca n't stay a minute longer ! Charles , I wish you luck in that reform we were speaking of , but I have n't much hope looking at Clara . There is such a thing as total depravity . Oh , here ! taking package from under his arm . What am I thinking of ? I was running away with your package hands it to Clara . CLARA refusing it . Oh , but it 's yours , Mr. Hibbard . I could n't think of taking it . Really , you must keep it to remember us by . Put it among your art treasures at home , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it remember us and this delightful evening , from which we are all taking away so much . You must keep it  --  that 's part of the bargain , is n't it ? And now are we even ? THE THIEF Even ? Far from it . I yield you your woman 's right to the last word , and I admit it 's the best stoops and kisses her hand . Good-night , Clara . To the reporter . May I give you a lift back to town ? REPORTER Thanks . As far as the Hempsteds ' corner . Good-night . Thank you for this much help . Exeunt . CHARLES Thank goodness , they 've gone . What relief ! That pace is too rapid for me . You had me running round in circles . But he 's got the picture , and we 're safe at last . But do n't you think , Clara , you took some awful risks . You goaded him pretty far . p. 23 CLARA I had to . Did you hear him call me Clara ? CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't a bad fellow , was he ? I could n't help liking him in spite of his impudence . CLARA You showed it . You took sides with him against me all the time the reporter was here . But , you know , he was right about our house . It 's all wrong . The Hempsteds would see it in a minute . I believe I 'll clear out this cabinet and have this room done over in mahogany . CHARLES Too expensive this winter . CLARA Birch will do just as well  --  nobody knows the difference . Listen ! is he coming back ? REPORTER in the doorway . Excuse me  --  listen . Mr. Hibbard says you 've given him the wrong package . He says you need this to go with the picture of your grandmother . And he says , sir , that you need to get wise to your own family . He 's waiting for me . Goodnight ! Exit . CHARLES angrily . Get wise to my own family ? He may know all about art undoing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Looks at picture , which represents George Washington . Clara ! you did that ! laughs uproariously
