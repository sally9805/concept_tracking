Weeping bitter salt tears last week by the bitter salt waters of Port Said was plump Amanullah , exiled King of Afghanistan . He stood by the rail of the P. &; O. liner Mooltan and moaned to a battery of sympathetic reporters : <P> " Kingship no longer has any charms for me . I wish I could be allowed to settle down as a mere farmer in the country I love . <P> " I am sure that the present rgime in my country is doomed to failure sooner or later . In fact I am thinking of returning within a year after a stay in Italy , where I know I have the friendship of King Vittorio Emanuele and Premier Mussolini . " <P> One newsgatherer had the temerity to ask grief-stricken Amanullah if it were true that Col. Thomas Edward ( Revolt in the Desert ) Lawrence , British secret agent , had a part in stirring up the revolution . <P> Amanullah shook his head and said : <P> " Any of the mullahs Mohammedan religious teachers were better able to incite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interview , Amanullah 's wife , Queen Thuraya , lay , heavy and silent , in her deck chair . She had just borne another child ( a daughter named India ) at Bombay and looked more like a poor emigrant than an exiled queen . Amanullah complained of poverty , said he had only $30 , had had to abandon his clothes when he fled from Kandahar , Afghanistan . <P> Only one year ago , sad Amanullah had ten thousand times $30 , dozens of suits of clothes . Touring Europe he rode with Kings , witnessed sham battles , inspected shops in each country he visited , blithely accepted magnificent gifts bestowed in the hope that he would make even more magnificent purchases . <P> In spite of his vaunted present " poverty " King Amanullah and his party of 24 were met by four large limousines at Marseilles where they left the Mooltan and proceeded to Italy by rail .
