There have already been biographies and more biographies of Woodrow Wilson . Hardly had the War President died last February , when Josephus Daniels rushed down to his private domain in North Carolina to pen one . Last summer , William Allen White undertook another . But at last an official and authorized biography is to be produced . Mrs. Wilson has announced the undertaking . <P> She chose as biographer Ray Stannard Baker , of Amherst , Mass . Mr. Maker , a man of 54 , is the author of a number of books on public questions and ( under the pen name of David Grayson ) of a number of essays . After leaving the University of Michigan , he was connected with McClure 's Syndicate and McClure 's Magazine , served as an editor of the American Magazine . During the War he was attached to the State Department , and afterward served as Director of Publicity for the American Commission at the Paris Peace Conference . It was there that Baker - the spectacled , professional , earnest man with his deep chin-dimple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wilson gave him access to his papers , and Mr. Baker produced , two years ago , Woodrow Wilson and World Settlement , a three-volume exhaustive study of the Versailles Peace . It was probably Mr. Wilson 's perception that he was a writer of earnestness , intelligence and accuracy as well as of force and spirit that won him the opportunity of making his three-volume study . <P> Just a year ago , less than ten days before his death , Mr. Wilson dictated one of his last letters-to Mr. Baker : <P> Every time that you disclose your mind to me you increase my admiration and affection for you . I am glad to promise you that with regard to my personal correspondence and similar papers , I shall regard you as my preferred creditor , and shall expect to afford you the first-and if necessary exclusive-access to those papers . <P> But I have it on my conscience that you should know that I have not made the smallest beginning towards accumulating and making accessible the papers we have in mind . I would rather have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I trust that you will not think it unreasonable that I should ask you to accept these promises in lieu of others which would be more satisfactory , but which , for the present , would be without practical value . <P> Last week , Mrs. Wilson announced that this promise was to be made good . She was turning over to Mr. Baker " the entire private record in letters and documents of Mr. Wilson 's service as President . " The letters alone number 30,000 . In addition there are many of Mr. Wilson 's own memoranda made in shorthand , as well as notes which he had typed himself . Mrs. Wilson declared : <P> " Mr. Baker will have no restrictions whatever upon a full and truthful account . It will be an unhurried work , carefully verified at every point , and studied with co-operation of many of Mr. Wilson 's friends and associates . "
