Art , like Liberty , is made to stand sponsor for a variety of things . License is their little sister , without whom they would be sad indeed , yet whose excesses are frequently embarrassing . <P> Last week License sported , as is her wont every June , on her favorite bank of the Seine , the left one . All one afternoon the cafs and bars along the Boulevard de Montparnasse filled slowly with semi-nude men and women , daubed and stained , and greasepainted brown , black , crimson , orange , vermilion , blue and green , with headdresses , beads and anklets intended to indicate that they were Aztecs of ancient Mexico . They were students , and eager friends of students , and joyful models of students at the Academie des Beaux Arts . The year 's work was over and preparations were in order for the annual Quatre Arts ball where all cares are lost at 9 o'clock , all caution at 12 , all scruples and costumes at 3 , all sanity before the dawn . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the year-offered no objections to the staggering rout that chortled , hiccuped and quarreled homeward with grease paint run amuck and hardly enough draperies among the multitude to have warmed a frog . Scenes of Saturnalian abandonment had been enacted-frenzied dancing , delirious overtures , posturing , French embraces and the parade of " beauty unadorned , " in which " La Belle Hlne , " a highland peasant wench but lately come to Paris , had been elected " Empress of the Voluptuous Contours " and suitably saluted by one and all . . . . Cabled the urbane United Press : " One of the worst orgies in the history of Paris . " <P> * Invitations to the ball are issued only to enrolled members of the Beaux Arts Academy but many an outsider scrambles and scrimmages for the few extra tickets reserved .
