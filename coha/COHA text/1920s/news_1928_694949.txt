txt Three hundred years ago today there landed on Manhattan Island the Rev. JoNAs MICHAELIUS , the first minister of the Dutch colony and organizer of the first religious body on Manhattan Island and of " the oldest church of settled min " istry and continuous service in the United States . " There was one of earlier founding in Virginia , but with prolonged periods without a minister or services . Dutch New Yorkers boast a priority even over the Pilgrim Church in Plymouth , Mass. , which " did not have an or " dained minister in charge till " 1629 . " Before all these were the missionary priests following the northern streams and penetrating the forests , of whom BANCROFT said : " Not a cape was turned nor " a river entered but a Jesuit led " the way . " MICHAELIUS was the pioneer pastor of this island . It is stated that he was the first university man to settle in the Middle Colonies . He preached both in Dutch and French and later to the Indians in their native tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , 1628 , is the earliest known to be extant written from Manhattan Island , or " the " Island of the Manhates in New " Netherland , " as he called it . In this letter he speaks of the temporalities of the little colony . The air is very healthful , but the changes of heat and cold are unusually sudden . The country produces many species of good things which would greatly serve to ease life , but " all is uncultivated . " He sends back to Holland two small bones ( taken from beavers ) which the savage women wear upon their bodies. , eihey would , if obtainable , be choice exhibits for the new City Museum . A second letter , written a few days later , speaks ' of establishing " the form of a church , " the Honorable Director , PETER MINUIT , the man who purchased the island for $24 , and his brother-in-law , a " storekeeper , " being his elders . The description of the first communion deserves to be recalled in his language : At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was observed , not without great joy and comfort to many , we had ' fully fifty communicants  --  Walloons and Dutch ; of whom , a portion made their first confession of faith . before us , and others exhibited their church certificates . Others had forgotten to bring their certificates with them , not thinking that a church would be formed and established here ; and some who brought them , . had lost them unfortunately in a general conflagration , but they were admitted upon the satisfactory testimony of others to whom they were known , and also upon their daily good deportment , since one can not observe strictly all the usual formalities in making a beginning under such circumstances . From this modest beginning the Reformed Church has spread from the lower end of Manhattan Island to every part of the United States with its educated ministry and its concern for the material needs of its members , till now it spends $5,400 , - 000 through 735 churches .
