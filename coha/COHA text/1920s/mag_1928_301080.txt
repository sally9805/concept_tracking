When U.S. telephone subscribers ask for West 4251 and get East 4391 , they slam down indignant receivers and call the New York ( Boston , Denver , Los Angeles , Savannah ) telephone system the worst in the world . Of course they really know that the U.S. telephone system is the best in the world . And if they have tried to use South American telephones , they realize the shocking extent of their exaggeration . <P> For south of the Mexican border , Latin American telephone systems are now on a par with the U.S. systems of 30 years ago . Some of their equipment actually dates from that period . Important cities have no direct links ; rural telephones scarcely exist . Around each densely settled community is spun a small network of telephones , having no relation to neighboring networks . In all Latin America , there is less than one telephone for each 100 inhabitants . The present U.S. ratio is 16 to 100 . <P> Reasons for laggard Latin American communications are 1 ) lack of capital ; 2 ) lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notoriously well-supplied with all three of these desirable attributes are U. S. communication companies . An enterprising executive , therefore , might well ask himself this question : Why should my company not invade this deplorably backward continent , consolidate its scattered , ineffective companies , modernize its lines , link its capitals ? <P> Last week , it became apparent that such an executive had both asked and answered such a question . The executive was Col. Sosthenes Behn . His company was the 8-year-old International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp. , which last week announced plans to pay $60,000,000 for the British-owned United River Plate Telephone Co. , serving 185,000 subscribers in Buenos Aires and four Argentine provinces . <P> By this purchase , Col. Behn drew into I. T. &; T. 's system the second largest telephone company in South America . British stockholders recalled , last week , that he had already gained control of the third largest ( Chile Telephone Co. ) and fourth largest ( Montevideo Telephone Co. ) , both wrested from British interests . Last June , I. T. &; T. celebrated an extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its telephone lines across the 13,000-ft . Andes , linking Valparaiso , Buenos Aires , Montevideo . <P> Col. Behn 's great design thus became obvious to the most casual observer . I. T. &; T. cables stretch to the west coast of South America . Here they connect with the trans-Andean cable and telephone lines . And these lines in turn connect with the domestic telephone systems of Chile , Uruguay and now , Argentina . Thus a fast message may be relayed from New York to a house in the suburbs of Montevideo without once leaving I. T. &; T. wires . <P> Only one major South American telephone company remains outside I. T. &; T. control . Canadian-owned , this company operates from Rio de Janeiro , is the largest on the continent . It would be rash to forecast the plans of silent Col. Sosthenes Behn . But no one would be surprised if the next purchase by I. T. &; T. carried its network into Rio de Janeiro . <P> To finance its purchase , I. T. &; T. announced an issue of $57,300,000 ten-year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 , into I. T. &; T. common stock . Heading the banking syndicate will be , of course , I. T. &; T. 's early friend and first banker , the great house of J. P. Morgan &; Co.
