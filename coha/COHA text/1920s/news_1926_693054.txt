txt Bishop Pascual Diaz , Secretary of the Mexican Episcopate , issued a statement today declaring that the Catholics were prepared to wait for months and possibly for years for a satisfactory settlement of the conflict between the Church and State caused by the enforcement of the religious articles of the Constitution . The statement refers to the case of the German Catholics who , it says . were forced to obey the drastic laws of Bismarck , but who finally triumphed and recovered their religious liberty . Bishop Diaz , who is the official spokesman of the Church , states that the Catholics can not rely on promises but must face the facts . He declares that the Catholics can not accept any proposal until the Government 's religious regulations are changed and the constitutional clauses amended . Priests and people alike , says the statement , are at one in agreeing to maintain this stand , although it . may take years to achieve their end . God will help the Catholics to win , it declares . Text of the Statement . The statement reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are following the religious controversy that when Senor Saenz , the Minister of Foreign Relations , arrived in Mexico City he was forced to say that the statements said to have been made by him in San Antonio were incorrect . " The Minister does not say what parts of the statements are incorrect . We have tried to find out what the inaccuracies might be , and the truth is that we are unable to find them . " His reported statement was that there exists in Mexico a faction discontented and agitated by the religious policy of General Calles , and that legal mandates must be respected and obeyed , but if these mandates are ' against the welfare could correct . " Without doubt the Minister was obliged , when he arrived in Mexico City , to deny affirmations which he included ( in his statements in San Antonio , such as the one that the discontent and agitation of the Catholics could be quieted through amendments of the clauses of the penal laws and the articles of the Constitution which the Catholics believe are against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These statements made in San AnI tonio have the air of liberty and jus // tice peculiar to the Americans of the North , so much so that we were inspired with confidence for the future , believing that this would serve as a lesson for the Congressmen when studying the question of a reformation of the laws . " But the new statement caused us to despair . The Minister states that he only expressed his opinion , based upon statements made by President Calles , that as long as the laws existed the Government has an obligation to enforce compliance with them and , without denying that in the future . it might reform them , the Government would proceed within the criterion that the same laws show . " This is what the Minister calls his ' own opinion . It is a truth so common that we have no need to repeat it and we can not call it his opinion but an elemental principle of public morals that ' the true law must be obeyed , ' but the legal regulations and precepts of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sees No Hope in " This Wavering . " " In the face of this wavering , we can see no hope of betterment of the situation , and even less still when The Excelsior of today states that ' a per-1 son who is known as a real official Government spokesman ' said that if the Episcopate accepts with good faith the legal dispositions and resumes public worship , establishing normality , the regulations of Article 130. which are now ' being studied . would eliminate all harshness that would make the practice of religion difficult . " But , on the other hand , it was stated , if these proofs of good faith were not shown the situation would change , and instead of the resumption of worship being left in the hands of the Episcopate the Government would become the arbitrator in this matter , as the churches are in the hands of citizens and before the priests again can take charge of the churches each one must recognize the law and satisfy all the requirements demanded of the clergy . Will Hold Out " For Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repetition of what the entire world knows : The attitude not only of the Episcopate , but of priests and Catholic people is that they will not resume public worship in the churches until the regulations are removed and the Constitutional articles which are against the liberty of conscience and I the right of religious teaching are amended . Perhaps months and years may pass , but we are disposed to wait patiently and to work on through whatever legitimate means we can employ . " We are confident that , with the help of God , our priests and the Catholic people will know how to obey their prelates and will not help in the least the schismatic work that is clearly seen at this moment . " The regulation of Article 130 , with which we are threatened , if it stifles the liberty of Catholics , will only make us stronger in our stand and will bring to us a renewal of the enthusiastic approbation of the entire civilized world . " For many years the Catholics of Germany were forced to endure the tyranny of Bismarck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iron Chancellor ' saw his work a failure and died alone in his castle . " Newspaper Asks for Amendments . Reform of the religious clauses in the Constitution is advocated in an editorial today in The Impartial . The writer begins with a reference to a conversation he had with the late President Carranza , under whom the Constitution of 1917 was drafted , and quotes the former President as saying : " We have gone far beyond where we should have . " The editorial continues : " Just as we deemed it necessary to abolish the death penalty , as we believed that criminals might be regenerated , we should place the clergy in a position where they can rectify their past errors instead of reviving old hatreds . " To do this reforms are necessary in Articles 3 , 27 and 130 of the Constitution . They have too much revolutionary color . " As a majority of the people , more than 80 per . cent . of the citizens , desires retards in the Constitution , the Government should study means of removing the radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotically defend the same as we do our language , for these constitute the principal characteristerles of our nationality . " If we were Protestants instead Of Catholics and spoke English Instead of Spanish there would be no practical reason leg the existence g the Rio Grande dividing line between the two countries . " The writer adds that the situation in Mexico now is much different from that of 1917 , when the Constitution was framed during the heat of the revolution , and concludes : " But now we are more serene and have less passion . We should re-study those clauses which , in my opinion , were written without study of or adaptation to the national characteristics and the circumstances of our national life . " Cabinet Minister Opposes Change . Adalberto Tejada , Secretary of the Interior , in a statement published here today , says of the proposition to amend the religious clauses of the Con , stitution : " My personal opinion has been ' clearly defined in previous statements . The amendments which the clergy speak of would throw us back to before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new fight to regain their liberty of conscience . " Such amendments , moreover , would be hurtful , as the demands of the clergy are against the national aspirations in the economic , moral and intellectual order . They would put us in a situation like that which preceded our reform wars . " Catholic organizations here say they are preparing to take an active part in politics with the object of electing Catholics to the House of Representatives and to the Senate in the next elections two years hence . They say they are working slowly and will enter the field in the next municipal election with carefully selected candidates pledged to work for the advancement of Catholic interests and the re-establishment of normal conditions for the Church . The Catholics say they will not form a party bearing a religious name , as this is prohibited by the decree of July 2 , but they will join other political groups with the same aims as themselves and will confine their activities within legal limits . Mexicans Here Held Calles Backers . Aaron Saenz , Minister of Foreign Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said today that he found the majority of Mexicans in the United States in favor of the religious policy of the Administration of General Calles . He said some groups had declared they were solidly behind the President in his present program . Senor Saenz said that the Bishop of Tucson , Ariz. , had attacked the Mexican Constitution and advised Mexicans not to obey it because it was the work of fanatics . Senor Saenz thought ft strange that the Bishop should thus attack the fundamental law of Mexico , which , he said , was of interest only to Mexicans . Senor Saenz said that particularly in the southern part of the United States intense agitation against the Mexican Government was being carried on , especially by Spanish priests recently expelled from Mexico . He said the priests had requested Mexicans living in the southern part of the United States not to take part in the celebrations on the anniversary pf Mexico 's independence , Sept. 16k but that the Mexicans were refusing to pay any attention to the appeals . The Foreign Minister also declared that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico .
