Censorship need not be official to be effective . One Manhattan publishing house has lately learned this truth . The publishers are Charles Scribner 's Sons . The unofficially censored book is Edwin Franden Dakin 's Mrs. Eddy : The Biography of a Virginal Mind , published by Scribner 's last August , now unobtainable at many a bookstore . The unofficial censors are Christian Scientists . <P> Last week the book department of Lord &; Taylor , Manhattan department store , leased by the Doubleday-Doran Book Shops , Inc. , stopped displaying Mrs. Eddy . Simultaneously The New Republic , Manhattan liberal weekly , appeared with an article by Newspaperman Craig F. Thompson of the New York World , entitled " The Christian Science Censorship . " Said Newspaperman Thompson : " The Church maintains in every state . . . a Committee on Publication . . . ' to correct in a Christian manner injustices done Mrs. Eddy or members of this Church by the daily press , by periodicals or circulated literature of any sort . ' " <P> Author Thompson quoted letters from booksellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle , Atlanta , Cleveland , telling of complaints against the book , threats to withdraw custom unless sale of the book was stopped , testifying to the effective activities of Christian Science Committees on Publication . Author Thompson reminded his readers of the fate of an earlier biography of Mrs. Eddy , The Memoirs of Mary Baker Eddy , by Adam &; Lillian S. Dickey , published in 1927 by the Merrymount Press of Boston . This book was recalled at the behest of the Board of Directors of the Mother Church in Boston so thoroughly that now only four copies exist . <P> What Christian Scientists have objected to in all but the authorized life of Mrs. Eddy ( The Life of Mary Baker Eddy by Sibyl Wilbur ) are alleged misstatements , " obnoxious , " libelous , about the founder of Christian Science . Author Dakin 's book says that Mary Baker Eddy plagiarized , took morphine , made no miraculous cures . <P> Though denying that the boycott was or would be successful in stopping the sale of the Dakin biography , Publisher Maxwell Evarts Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously affected sale of the book in four-fifths of the bookstores of the country . It should have sold three times as well . "
