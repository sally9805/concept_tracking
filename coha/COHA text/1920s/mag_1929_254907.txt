In Hollywood are the new $75,000,000 studios of Fox Film Corp , Throughout the U. S. are some 1,200 theatres controlled by Fox Theatres Corp . In almost every country are Fox distributing agencies . In sole command of the Fox organization was , until last week , William Fox who from an investment of $1,667 built the entire structure , amassed a personal fortune once estimated at over $50,000,000 . <P> During the summer , Cineman Fox , proud of the quick expansion that had brought his organization Loew 's Inc. , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , and the Gaumont Theatres in England , decided to consolidate all his holdings into one In September the authorized Class A stock of Fox Film was increased from 900,000 to 4,900,000 shares , but the consolidation never took place . Last summer Mr. Fox , injured in an automobile accident ( TIME , July 29 ) , was away from his office for almost two months . When he recovered he scarcely had time to start his plan with an attempt to distribute Fox Theatres stock to his patrons ( TIME , Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture companies stockmarket breaks do not mean diminished profits , for like tobacco companies they are " depression proof . " But at this particular time the stockmarket decline brought severe trouble to Cineman Fox . During the recent period of expansion he had needed great sums of cash . These he had obtained by short-term loans upon the stock of acquired companies . With $91,000,000 of these notes falling due , with his collateral down , with conditions bad for refinancing , Cineman Fox for the first time needed assistance . Last week he summoned aid by appointing a trustee-triumvirate consisting of himself , a banker , a manufacturing engineer . <P> Triumvirate . Banker of the triumvirate is Harold Leonard Stuart , bachelor president of famed Halsey , Stuart &; Co . In 1927 his firm issued a booklet , The Motion Picture Industry as a Basis for Bond Financing , at the same time underwriting their first Fox issue . Trustee Stuart will represent his firm as Fox bankers and his firm 's customers as large investors . <P> John Edward Otterson , president of Electrical Research Products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn a subsidiary of American Telephone &; Telegraph , is the third member of the triumvirate . Twenty million dollars of sound equipment in the 1,200 Fox Theatres was installed by his company . In addition , Western Electric receives royalties on its patents used by Fox , is therefore concerned with the future business of the company . <P> Almost the first act of the trustees was to appoint Charles Evans Hughes counsel . To him will come not only the routine problems of passing on the legality of the triumvirate 's financing , but the problem of facing the suit brought against Fox last fortnight by the Government , charging violation of the Clayton anti-trust law by its ownership of Loew 's . <P> The object of the triumvirate is not to change the policy of the company but to arrange a method for meeting the obligations incurred by Cineman Fox . Assurance that the affairs of the company will remain in such conservative trustees ' hands for five years will make lenders more willing .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
