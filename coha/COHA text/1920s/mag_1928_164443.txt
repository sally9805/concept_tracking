There are almost as many seasick cures as there are sufferers . Last week Drs . J. Frank Pearcy and Daniel B. Hayden of the University of Chicago Medical School advocated a new one , in the American Medical Association Journal . They had been working on ears and eyes in hospital and laboratory ; they noticed that lowering the normal blood pressure by means of sodium nitrite decreased the dizziness and " seasick " feeling of subjects after they had been rapidly rotated . Believing that seasickness is caused by overstimulation of the labyrinth of the ear by the constant changing motion of boats , they decided to give sodium nitrite a public trial . Dr. Hayden had planned a European trip ; he made the liner his laboratory . During a tempestuous passage he rounded up 16 tormented travelers . After each had been given a well-known treatment ( subcutaneous injections of epinephrine chloride ) , he started his experiment . To eight he gave three to five grains of sodium nitrite every two hours . All eight were cured after the second dose . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill for two days . <P> Recently Drs . O. Brunns and E. Hornicke in the Mnchener Medizinische Wochenschrift offered a diametrically opposed therapy . Their observations showed that people with high blood pressure rarely suffer from seasickness ; that there was a drop in blood pressure at the worst point of the disease . They suggested , therefore , drugs to raise blood pressure . <P> No drug will help all of the people all of the time . Mothersill 's Seasick Remedy guaranteed " in every case " is sometimes efficacious ; it contains , as its advertisement asserts , " no cocain ; " instead it has 45 per cent chlorbutanol , a cocain substitute often used as a local anesthetic . Wise ones , when seasick , will consult a doctor .
