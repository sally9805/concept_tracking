SCENE . The parlor of the Jordan Homestead at Veazie , Maine . It is late October , and through the two windows at the back one may see a bileak countryside , the grass brown and lifeless , and the bare limbs of the trees silhouetted against a gray sky . Here , in the room that for a hundred years has been the rallying point of the Jordan family , a group of relatives are gathered to await the death of the old woman who is the head of their clan . The room in which they wait is as dull and as drab as the lives of those who have lived within its walls . Here we have the cleanliness that is next to godliness , but no sign of either comfort or beauty , both of which are looked upon with suspicion as being signposts on the road to perdition . In this group are the following characters : HENRY JORDAN , a heavy-set man of fifty , worn by his business cares into a dull sort of hopeless resignation ; EMMA , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a look of chronic displeasure ; NETTIE , her daughter by a former marriage , a vain and shallow little rustic beauty ; SADIE , a thin , tight-lipped woman of forty , a widow and a gossip ; ORIN , her son , a pasty-faced boy of ten with large spectacles ; ELLA , a " Maiden lady " of thirty-six , restless and dissatisfied . ELLA and SADIE , true Jordans by birth , are a degree above EMMA in social standing , at least they were until HENRY 'S marriage to EMMA made her a somewhat resentful member of the family . In EMMA 'S dialogue and in her reactions , I have attempted a rather nice distinction between the two grades of rural middle-class folk ; the younger characters here , as in most other communities , have advanced one step . Rise : At rise there is a long silence ; the occupants of the room are ill at ease . EMMA is grim and frowning . NETTIE sits with a simper of youthful vanity , looking stealthily at herself from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap vanity case . ELLA and SADIE have been crying and dab at their eyes a bit ostentatiously . HENRY makes a thoughtful note with a pencil , then returns his notebook to his pocket and warms his hands at the stove . There is a low whistle of a cold autumn wind as some dead leaves are blown past the window . ORIN , who has a cold in his head , sniffs viciously ; the others , with the exception of his mother , look at him in remonstrance . An eight-day clock in sight , through the door to the hall , strikes four . EMMA sternly . Four o'clock . p. 3 HENRY looks at watch . Five minutes of . That clock 's been fast for more'n thirty years . NETTIE looks at wrist watch . My watch says two minutes after . HENRY Well , it 's wrong ! EMMA acidly . You gave it to her yourself , did n't you ? FELLOWS sighs . Good land ! What does it matter ? NETTIE offended . Oh ! Does n't it ? Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blood relation . EMMA Nettie loves her grandma , do n't you , dear ? NETTIE Some folks not so far off may get fooled before long about how much grandma and I was to each other . EMMA sternly . You hush ! Again there is a pause , and again it is broken by a loud sniff from ORIN , as the women look at him in disgust . SADIE speaks up in his defense . FELLOWS He 's got kind of a cold in his head . HENRY The question is , ai n't he got a handkerchief ? p. 4 FELLOWS Here , Orin ! She hands him her handkerchief . ELLA The idea ! No handkerchief when you 've come expectin ' some one to die ! ORIN I had one , but I used it up . He blows his nose . HENRY After four . Well , I expect they 'll have to close the store without me . ELLA I left everything just as soon as Jane sent me word ! FELLOWS Why should Jane be with her instead of you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her nervous , and I guess she 's pretty low . He looks at his watch again . I said I 'd be back before closin ' time . I do n't know as I dare to trust those boys . EMMA You ca n't tell about things , when Sadie 's husband died we sat there most all night . FELLOWS angrily . Yes , and you grudged it to him , I knew it then and it is n't likely I 'm going to forget it . ELLA Will was a good man , but even you ca n't say he was ever very dependable . EMMA My first husband died sudden  --  She turns to NETTIE.  --  you ca n't remember it , dear . p. 5 ELLA You did n't remember it very long , it wa' n't much more'n a year before you married Henry . HENRY sighs . Well , he was as dead then as he 's ever got to be . He turns and glances nervously out window . I do n't know but what I could just run down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FELLOWS You 're the oldest of her children , a body would think you 'd be ashamed . HENRY Oh , I 'll stay . There is a silence . ORIN sniffs . ELLA glares at him . ELLA Of course he could sit somewheres else . SADIE puts her arm about ORIN and looks spitefully at ELLA . DOCTOR CURTIS , an elderly country physician , comes down the stairs and enters the room , all turn to look at him . DOCTOR CURTIS No change at all . I 'm sendin ' Jane to the drug store . ELLA rises eagerly . I 'll just run up and sit with mother . SADIE jumps up and starts for door . FELLOWS It might be better if I went . ELLA Why might it ? They stand glaring at each other before either attempts to pass the DOCTOR , whose ample form almost blocks the doorway. p. 6 FELLOWS I 've been a wife and a mother . DOCTOR CURTIS Hannah 's with her , you know . I told you I did n't want anybody up there but Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DOCTOR CURTIS You do n't have to tell me , I brought both of you into the world . The right nursing might pull her through , even now ; nothing else can , and I 've got the two women I want . He crosses to HENRY at stove . Why do n't you put a little wood on the fire ? HENRY Why  --  I thought ' t was warm enough . ELLA Because you was standin ' in front of it gettin ' all the heat . HENRY fills the stove from wood basket . JANE CROSBY enters on stairs and crosses into the room . JANE is twenty-four , a plainly dressed girl of quiet manner . She has been " driven into herself " as one of our characters would describe it , by her lack of sympathy and affection and as a natural result she is not especially articulate ; she speaks , as a rule , in short sentences , and has cultivated an outward coldness that in the course of time has become almost aggressive . CROSBY I 'll go now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah 's frightened . p. 7 DOCTOR CURTIS Get it as quick as you can , Jane ; I do n't know as it 's any use , but we 've got to keep on tryin ' . CROSBY Yes . She exits ; DOCTOR warms his hands . DOCTOR CURTIS Jane 's been up with her three nights . I do n't know when I 've seen a more dependable girl . ELLA She ought to be . HENRY If there 's any gratitude in the world . DOCTOR CURTIS Oh , I guess there is ; maybe there 'd be more if there was more reason for it . It 's awful cold up there , but I guess I 'll be gettin ' back . He crosses toward door . HENRY Doctor ! He looks at his watch . DOCTOR CURTIS stops in doorway . Well ? HENRY It 's quite a bit past four , I do n't suppose  --  I do n't suppose you can tell  --  DOCTOR CURTIS No , I ca n't tell . He turns and exits up the stairs . ELLA There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear him ? " Did n't know when he 'd seen a more dependable girl than her ! " p. 8 EMMA Makes a lot of difference who 's goin ' to depend on her . I ai n't , for one . NETTIE If I set out to tell how she 's treated me lots of times , when I 've come over here to see grandma , nobody would believe a word of it . FELLOWS Mother took her in out of charity . ELLA And kept her out of spite . HENRY I do n't know as you ought to say that , Ella . ELLA It 's my place she took , in my own mother 's house . I 'd been here now , but for her . I ai n't goin ' to forget that . No ! Me , all these years payin ' board and slavin ' my life out , makin ' hats , like a nigger . NETTIE smartly . Oh ! So that 's what they 're like . I 've often wondered ! ELLA rises . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insultin ' me , Henry Jordan , or I wo n't stay here another minute . EMMA angry . Common ! NETTIE Mother ! HENRY sternly . Hush up ! All of yer ! FELLOWS It 's Jane we ought to be talkin ' about . p. 9 EMMA Just as soon as you 're the head of the family , Henry , you 've got to tell her she ai n't wanted here ! HENRY Well  --  I do n't know as I 'd want to do anything that was n't right . She 's been here quite a spell . FELLOWS Eight years ! ELLA And just a step-cousin , once removed . HENRY I guess mother 's made her earn her keep . I do n't know as ever there was much love lost between ' em . EMMA As soon as your mother 's dead , you 'll send her packing . HENRY We 'll see . I do n't like countin ' on mother 's going ; that way . FELLOWS hopefully . Grandmother lived to eighty-four . HENRY All our folks was long-lived ; nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ELLA Of course she 'll divide equal , between us three ? HENRY doubtfully . Well , I do n't know ! FELLOWS Orin is her only grandchild ; she wo n't forget that . HENRY Nettie , there , is just the same as my own . I adopted her legal , when I married Emma . p. 10 EMMA Of course you did . Your mother 's too  --  just a woman to make distinctions ! NETTIE Yes , and the funny part of it is grandma may leave me a whole lot , for all any of you know . ELLA Nonsense ! She 'll divide equally between us three ; wo n't she , Henry ? HENRY sadly . She 'll do as she pleases , I guess we all know that . ELLA She 's a religious woman , she 's got to be fair ! HENRY Well , I guess it would be fair enough if she was to remember the trouble I 've had with my business . I do n't know what she 's worth , she 's as tight-mouthed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quite a little sum . ELLA Well , you wo n't get it . Not if I go to law . EMMA It 's disgusting . Talking about money at a time like this . HENRY I like to see folks reasonable . I do n't know what you 'd want of a third of all mother 's got , Ella . FELLOWS to ELLA . You , all alone in the world ! ELLA Maybe I wo n't be , when I get that money . FELLOWS You do n't mean you 'd get married ? p. 11 EMMA At your age ! ELLA I mean I never had anything in all my life ; now I 'm going to . I 'm the youngest of all of you , except Ben , and he never was a real Jordan . I 've never had a chance ; I 've been stuck here till I 'm most forty , worse than if I was dead , fifty times worse ! Now I 'm going to buy things  --  everything I want  --  I do n't care what  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Anything I want ! NETTIE A man ! NETTIE looks at ELLA in cruel amazement and all but ORIN burst into a laugh  --  ELLA turns up and hides her face against the window as ORIN pulls at his mother 's skirt . ORIN Mum ! Mum ! I thought you told me not to laugh , not once , while we was here ! HENRY You 're right , nephew , and we 're wrong , all of us . I 'm sorry , Ella , we 're all sorry . ELLA wipes her eyes . Laugh if you want to  --  maybe it wo n't be so long before I do some of it myself . HENRY thoughtfully . Equally between us three ? Well , poor mother knows best , of course . He sighs . FELLOWS She would n't leave him any , would she ,  --  Ben ? p. 12 ELLA shocked . Ben ! HENRY in cold anger . She 's a woman of her word ; no ! FELLOWS If he was here he 'd get around her ; he always did ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was him , and she 's had to pay for it . Sometimes it looks like it was a sort of a judgment . HENRY There has n't been a Jordan , before Ben , who 's disgraced the name in more'n a hundred years ; he stands indicted before the Grand Jury for some of his drunken devilment . If he had n't run away , like the criminal he is , he 'd be in the State 's Prison now , down to Thomaston . Do n't talk Ben to me , after the way he broke mother 's heart , and hurt my credit ! NETTIE I do n't remember him very well . Mother thought it better I should n't come around last time he was here ; but he looked real nice in his uniform . FELLOWS It was his bein ' born so long after us that made him seem like an outsider ; father and mother had n't had any children for years and years ! Of course I never want to sit in judgment on my own parents , but I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call proper . NETTIE to EMMA . Mother , do n't you think I 'd better leave the room ? p. 13 FELLOWS angrily . Not if half the stories I 've heard about you are true , I do n't . HENRY Come , come , no rows ! Is this a time or place for spite ? We 've always been a united family , we 've always got to be ,  --  leavin ' Ben out , of course . You ca n't make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . ORIN Mum ! Say , Mum ! He pulls at SADIE 'S dress . Why should anybody want to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear ? ELLA Ca n't you stop that boy askin ' such fool questions ? FELLOWS Well , as far as that goes , why should they ? It never sounded reasonable to me . HENRY sternly . Decent folks do n't reason about religion ; they just accept it . ORIN You could make a skin purse out of a sow 's ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk purse out of one . I 'll bet God could n't . HENRY Are you going to let him talk about God like that , like He was a real person ? ELLA I do n't know as a body could expect any better ; his father was a Baptist ! FELLOWS angrily . His father was a good man , and if he talked about God different from what you do , it was because he knew more about him . And as for my being here at all  --  She rises with her arms about ORIN.  --  I would n't do it , not for anything less than my own mother 's deathbed . p. 14 HENRY This family do n't ever agree on nothin ' but just to differ . EMMA As far as I see , the only time you ever get together is when one of you is dead . ELLA Maybe that 's the reason I got such a feelin ' against funerals . The outside door opens and JANE enters , a druggist 's bottle in her hand ; she is followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better dressed than any of the others and is a man of a more cosmopolitan type ,  --  a New Englander , but a university man , the local judge and the leading lawyer of the town . CROSBY I met Judge Bradford on the way . JUDGE BRADFORD John Bradford . Court set late . I could n't get here before . Jane tells me that she 's very low . HENRY Yes . JUDGE BRADFORD I ca n't realize it ; she has always been so strong , so dominant . ELLA In the midst of life we are in death . ORIN Say , Mum , that 's in the Bible too ! FELLOWS Hush ! ORIN Well , ai n't it ? FELLOWS Will you hush ? p. 15 HENRY It 's our duty to hope so long as we can . JUDGE BRADFORD Yes , of course . CROSBY I 'll take this right up . She exits up the stairs . JUDGE BRADFORD removes his coat . I 'll wait . FELLOWS She ca n't see you ; she ai n't really what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Jane said . He crosses to stove and warms his hands . ELLA sighs . It 's a sad time for us , Judge ! JUDGE BRADFORD She was always such a wonderful woman . HENRY An awful time for us . Did you come up Main Street , Judge ? JUDGE BRADFORD Yes . HENRY Did you happen to notice if my store was open ? JUDGE BRADFORD No . HENRY Not that it matters  --  FELLOWS Nothing matters now . HENRY No  --  Mother was n't ever the kind to neglect things ; if the worst does come she 'll find herself prepared . Wo n't she ? Wo n't she , Judge ? p. 16 JUDGE BRADFORD Her affairs are , as usual , in perfect order . HENRY In every way ? JUDGE BRADFORD looks at him coldly . Her will is drawn and is on deposit in my office , if that is what you mean . HENRY Well  --  that is what I mean  --  I 'm no hypocrite . EMMA He 's the oldest of the family . He 's got a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENRY honestly . If I could make her well by givin ' up everything I 've got in the world , or ever expect to git , I 'd do it ! FELLOWS All of us would . HENRY If it 's in my mind at all , as I stand here , that she 's a rich woman , it 's because my mind 's so worried , the way business has been , that I 'm drove most frantic ; it 's because , well  --  because I 'm human ; because I ca n't help it . ELLA bitterly . You 're a man ! What do you think it 's been for me ! FELLOWS with arm about ORIN . His father did n't leave much , you all know that , and it 's been scrimp and save till I 'm all worn to skin and bone . p. 17 ELLA Just to the three of us , that would be fair . HENRY Judge ! My brother 's name ai n't in her will , is it ? Tell me that ? Ben 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talk about it , Henry . ELLA She 'd cut him off , she said , the last time he disgraced us , and she 's a woman of her word . FELLOWS eagerly , to JUDGE . And the very next day she sent for you because I was here when she telephoned ; and you came to her that very afternoon because I saw you from my front window cross right up to this door . JUDGE BRADFORD Possibly . I frequently drop in to discuss business matters with your mother for a moment on my way home . FELLOWS It was five minutes to four when you went in that day , and six minutes to five when you came out , by the clock on my mantel . JUDGE BRADFORD Your brother has been gone for almost two years ; your memory is very clear . ELLA So 's her window . NETTIE I know folks in this town that are scared to go past it . FELLOWS to her . I know others that ought to be . p. 18 HENRY discouraged . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs and into the room JUDGE BRADFORD looks at her . Well , Jane ? CROSBY No change . It 's  --  it 's pitiful , to see her like that . SADIE sobs and covers her face . HENRY It 's best we should try to bear this without any fuss , she 'd ' a ' wanted it that way . FELLOWS She did n't even want me to cry when poor Will died , but I did ; and somehow I do n't know but it made things easier . HENRY When father died she did n't shed a tear ; she 's been a strong woman , always . The early fall twilight has come on and the stage is rather dim , the hall at right is in deep shadow ; at the end of HENRY 'S speech the outside door supposedly out at right is opened , then shut rather violently . ELLA startled . Someone 's come in . FELLOWS Nobody 's got any right  --  She rises as someone is heard coming along the hall . HENRY sternly . Who 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mum ! Who is it ! He clings to his mother afraid , as all turn to the door , and BEN JORDAN steps into the room and faces them with a smile of reckless contempt . BEN is the black sheep of the Jordan family , years younger than any of the others , a wild , selfish , arrogant fellow , handsome but sulky and defiant . His clothes are cheap and dirty and he is rather pale and looks dissipated . He does n't speak but stands openly sneering at their look of astonishment . CROSBY quietly . I 'm glad you 've come , Ben . BEN contemptuously . You are ? CROSBY Yes , your mother 's awful sick . BEN She 's alive ? CROSBY Yes . BEN Well  --  He looks contemptuously about . Nobody missin ' . The Jordans are gathered again , handkerchiefs and all . HENRY You 'll be arrested soon as folks know you 've come . BEN scornfully . And I suppose you would n't bail me out , would you , Henry ? HENRY simply . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , all of you . You stink of the Ark , the whole tribe . It takes more than a few Edisons to change the Jordans ! ELLA How 'd you get here ? How 'd you know about mother ? BEN nods at JANE . She sent me word , to Bangor . FELLOWS to JANE . How 'd you get to know where he was ? CROSBY quietly . I knew . HENRY How 'd you come ; you do n't look like you had much money ? BEN She sent it . He nods toward JANE . God knows , it was n't much . ELLA to JANE . Did mother tell you to  --  ? BEN Of course she did ! CROSBY quietly . No , she did n't . HENRY You sent your own money ? CROSBY Yes , as he said it was n't much , but I did n't have much . BEN astonished . Why did you do it ? CROSBY I knew she was going to die ; twice I asked her if she wanted to see you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent for him ? CROSBY Yes . HENRY Why ? CROSBY He was the one she really wanted . I thought she 'd die happier seeing him . ELLA You took a lot on yourself , did n't you ? CROSBY Yes , she 's been a lonely old woman . I hated to think of her there , in the churchyard , hungry for him . BEN I 'll go to her . CROSBY It 's too late ; she would n't know you . BEN I 'll go . CROSBY The doctor will call us when he thinks we ought to come . BEN fiercely . I 'm going now . HENRY steps forward . No , you ai n't . BEN Do you think I came here , standin ' a chance of bein ' sent to jail , to let you tell me what to do ? HENRY If she 's dyin ' up there , it 's more'n half from what you 've made her suffer ; you 'll wait here till we go to her together . EMMA Henry 's right . FELLOWS Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impudence to show his face here , after what he 's done . BEN I 'm going just the same ! HENRY No , you ai n't . Their voices become loud . EMMA Henry ! Do n't let him go ! FELLOWS Stop him . ELLA grows shrill . He 's a disgrace to us . He always was . HENRY You 'll stay right where you are . He puts his hand heavily on BEN 'S shoulder  --  BEN throws him off fiercely . BEN Damn you ! Keep your hands off me ! HENRY staggers back and strikes against a table that falls to the floor with a crash . NETTIE screams . CROSBY Stop it  --  stop ! You must ! JUDGE BRADFORD Are you crazy ? Have you no sense of decency ? DOCTOR CURTIS comes quickly downstairs DOCTOR CURTIS What 's this noise ? I forbid it . Your mother has heard you . HENRY ashamed . I 'm sorry . p. 23 BEN sulkily . I did n't mean to make a row . HENRY It 's him . He looks bitterly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought trouble into the world with him when he came , and ever since . HANNAH , a middle-aged servant , comes hastily half-way downstairs and calls out sharply HANNAH Doctor ! Come , Doctor ! She exits up the stairs , as the DOCTOR crosses through the hall and follows her . ORIN afraid . Is she dead , Mum ? Does Hannah mean she 's dead ? SADIE hides her head on his shoulder and weeps . CROSBY I 'll go to her . She exits . ELLA violently . She 'll go . There ai n't scarcely a drop of Jordan blood in her veins , and she 's the one that goes to mother . EMMA coldly . Light the lamp , Nettie ; it 's gettin ' dark . NETTIE Yes , mother . She starts to light lamp . HENRY I 'm ashamed of my part of it , makin ' a row , with her on her deathbed . p. 24 BEN You had it right , I guess . I 've made trouble ever since I came into the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JUDGE BRADFORD sternly . You should n't have come here ; you know that , Ben . BEN I 've always known that , any place I 've been , exceptin ' only those two years in the Army . That 's the only time I ever was in right . JUDGE BRADFORD sternly . I would find it easier to pity you if you had anyone to blame besides yourself . BEN Pity ? Do you think I want your pity ? There is a pause . JANE is seen on stairs , they all turn to her nervously as she comes down and crosses into room . She stops at the door looking at them . HENRY slowly . Mother  --  mother 's  --  gone ! CROSBY Yes . There is a moment 's silence broken by the low sobs of the women who for a moment forget their selfishness in the presence of death . HENRY The Jordans wo n't ever be the same ; she was the last of the old stock , mother was  --  No , the Jordans wo n't ever be the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 DOCTOR CURTIS It 's no use tryin ' to tell you what I feel . I 've known her since I was a boy . I did the best I could . HENRY The best anybody could , Doctor , we know that . DOCTOR CURTIS I 've got a call I 'd better make  --  He looks at watch.  --  should have been there hours ago , but I had n't the heart to leave her . Who 's in charge here ? HENRY I am , of course . DOCTOR CURTIS I 've made arrangements with Hannah ; she 'll tell you . I 'll say good night now . HENRY Good night , Doctor . CROSBY And thank you . DOCTOR CURTIS We did our best , Jane . He exits . FELLOWS He 's gettin ' old . When Orin had the stomach trouble a month ago , I sent for Doctor Morris . I felt sort of guilty doin ' it , but I thought it was my duty . JUDGE BRADFORD You will let me help you , Jane ? CROSBY Hannah and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . You might come over for a minute this evening and we can talk things over . I 'll make the bed up in your old room , Ben , if you want to stay . p. 26 EMMA rises and looks at JANE coldly . Now , Henry Jordan , if she 's all through givin ' orders , maybe you 'll begin . ELLA Well , I should say so . Let 's have an understandin ' . FELLOWS You tell her the truth , Henry , or else one of us will do it for you . HENRY hesitates . Maybe it might be best if I should wait until after the funeral . ELLA You tell her now , or I will . CROSBY Tell me what ? HENRY We was thinkin ' now that mother 's dead , that there was n't much use in your stayin ' on here . CROSBY Yes ? She looks at him intently . HENRY We do n't aim to be hard , and we do n't want it said we was mean about it ; you can stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral , maybe a little longer , and I do n't know but what between us , we 'd be willing to help you till you found a place somewheres . CROSBY You ca n't help me , any of you . Of course now she 's dead , I 'll go . I 'll be glad to go . ELLA Glad ! CROSBY turns on them . I hate you , the whole raft of you . I 'll be glad to get away from you . She was the only one of you worth loving , and she did n't want it . p. 27 EMMA If that 's how you feel , I say the sooner you went the better . HENRY Not till after the funeral . I do n't want it said we was hard to her . JUDGE BRADFORD quietly . Jane is n't going at all , Henry . HENRY What 's that ? ELLA Of course she 's going . JUDGE BRADFORD No , she belongs here in this house . HENRY Not after l say she do n't . JUDGE BRADFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JUDGE BRADFORD From the moment of your mother 's death , everything here belonged to Jane . HENRY Not everything . JUDGE BRADFORD Yes , everything  --  your mother 's whole estate . BEN Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! He sits at right laughing bitterly . CROSBY That ca n't be , Judge , you must be wrong . It 's a mistake . JUDGE BRADFORD No . HENRY My mother did this ? JUDGE BRADFORD Yes . p. 28 HENRY Why ? You 've got to tell me why ! JUDGE BRADFORD That is n't a part of my duties . HENRY She could n't have done a thing like that without sayin ' why . She said something , did n't she ? JUDGE BRADFORD I do n't know that I care to repeat it . HENRY fiercely . You must repeat it ! JUDGE BRADFORD Very well . The day that will was drawn she said to me , " The Jordans are all waiting for me to die , like carrion crows around a sick cow in a pasture , watchin ' till the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to fool them , " she said , " I 'm going to surprise them ; they are all fools but Jane  --  Jane 's no fool . " BEN bitterly . No  --  Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Jane 's no fool ! JUDGE BRADFORD And she went on  --  He turns to JANE . You 'll forgive me , Jane ; she said , " JANE is stubborn , and set , and wilful , but she 's no fool . She 'll do better by the Jordan money than any of them . " ELLA We 'll go to law , that 's what we 'll do ! FELLOWS That 's it , we 'll go to law . HENRY to JUDGE , We can break that will ; you know we can ! p. 29 JUDGE BRADFORD It 's possible . HENRY Possible ! You know , do n't yer ! You 're supposed to be a good lawyer . JUDGE BRADFORD Of course if I am a good lawyer you ca n't break that will , because you see I drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar , after waitin ' all these years ? JUDGE BRADFORD There are small bequests left to each of you . FELLOWS How much ? JUDGE BRADFORD One hundred dollars each . ELLA shrilly . One hundred dollars . JUDGE BRADFORD I said that they were small . BEN You said a mouthful ! ELLA Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! She laughs wildly . HENRY sternly . Stop your noise , Ella . ELLA I  --  Ha ! Ha ! Ha !  --  I told you I was going to have my laugh , did n't I ? Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! ORIN pulls SADIE 'S dress . Mum ! What 's she laughin ' for ? FELLOWS You hush ! p. 30 EMMA faces them all in evil triumph . If anybody asked me , I 'd say it was a judgment on all of yer . You Jordans was always stuck up , always thought you was better'n anybody else . I guess I ought to know , I married into yer !  --  You a rich family ?  --  You the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! ORIN pulls SADIE 'S skirt . Ai n't she still dead , Mum ! Ai n't grandma still dead ? FELLOWS angrily . Of course she is . ORIN But I thought we was all goin ' to cry ! FELLOWS Cry then , you awful little brat . She slaps his face and he roars loudly ; she takes him by the arm and yanks him out of the room , followed by HENRY , EMMA , NETTIE and ELLA  --  through his roars , they all speak together as they go . EMMA to HENRY . One hundred dollars ! After all your blowi ' . HENRY It 's you , and that child of yourn ; you turned her against me . NETTIE Well , I just wo n't spend my hundred dollars for mournin ' . I 'll wear my old black dress ! ELLA And me makin ' hats all the rest of my life  --  just makin ' hats ! The front door is heard to shut behind them . JANE , BEN and JUDGE are alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking out at the deepening twilight . BEN sits at right. p. 31 BEN Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! " Crow buzzards " mother called us  --  the last of the Jordans  --  crow buzzards  --  and that 's what we are . JUDGE BRADFORD You ca n't stay here , Ben ; you know that as well as I do . I signed the warrant for your arrest myself . It 's been over a year since the Grand Jury indicted you for arson . BEN You mean you 'll give me up ? CROSBY You wo n't do that , Judge ; you 're here as her friend . JUDGE BRADFORD No , but if it 's known he 's here , I could n't save him , and it 's bound to be known . CROSBY to BEN . Were you careful coming ? BEN Yes . JUDGE BRADFORD It 's bound to be known . BEN He means they 'll tell on me . He nods his head toward door . My brother , or my sisters . JUDGE BRADFORD No , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What do I care ? I 'm sick of hiding out , half starved ! Let ' em do what they please . All I know is one thing ,  --  when they put her into her grave her sons and daughters are goin ' to be standin ' there , like the Jordans always do . p. 32 CROSBY quietly . Hannah will have your room ready by now . There are some clean shirts and things that was your father 's ; I 'll bring them to you . BEN uneasily . Can I go up there , just a minute ? CROSBY To your mother ? BEN Yes . CROSBY If you want to . BEN I do . CROSBY Yes , you can go . BEN turns and exits up the stairs . JANE crosses and sits by stove , sinking wearily into the chair . JUDGE BRADFORD And she left him nothing , just that hundred dollars , and only that because I told her it was the safest way to do it . I thought he was her one weakness , but it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRADFORD She was a grim old woman , Jane . CROSBY I think I could have loved her , but she did n't want it . JUDGE BRADFORD And yet she left you everything . CROSBY I do n't understand . JUDGE BRADFORD She left a sealed letter for you . It 's in my strong box ; you may learn from it that she cared more about you than you think . p. 33 CROSBY No . JUDGE BRADFORD There was more kindness in her heart than most people gave her credit for . CROSBY For her own , for Uncle Ned , who never did for her , for Ned , for the Jordan name . I do n't understand , and I do n't think I care so very much ; it 's been a hard week , Judge . She rests her head against the back of the chair . JUDGE BRADFORD I know , and you 're all worn out . CROSBY Yes . JUDGE BRADFORD It 's a lot of money , Jane . CROSBY I suppose so . JUDGE BRADFORD And so you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel ? CROSBY Just tired . She shuts her eyes . For a moment he looks at her with a smile , then turns and quietly fills the stove with wood as BEN comes slowly downstairs and into the room . BEN If there was only something I could do for her . JUDGE BRADFORD Jane 's asleep , Ben . BEN Did she look like that , unhappy , all the time ? JUDGE BRADFORD Yes . p. 34 BEN Crow buzzards ! God damn the Jordans ! Front door bell rings sharply , BEN is startled . JUDGE BRADFORD Steady there ! It 's just one of the neighbors , I guess . Bell rings again as HANNAH crosses downstairs and to hall . Hannah knows enough not to let anyone in . BEN slowly . When I got back , time before this , from France , I tried to go straight , but it was n't any good , I just do n't belong  --  HANNAH enters frightened HANNAH It 's Jim Jay ! BEN to JUDGE . And you did n't think my own blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly man of middle age , enters JAY I 'm sorry , Ben , I 've come for you ! JANE wakes , startled , and springs up . CROSBY What is it ? JAY I got to take him , Jane . BEN turns fiercely . Have you ! JAY quietly . I 'm armed , Ben  --  better not be foolish ! p. 35 CROSBY He 'll go with you , Mr. Jay . He wo n't resist . JAY quietly . He must n't . You got a bad name , Ben , and I ai n't a-goin ' to take any chances . BEN I thought I 'd get to go to her funeral , anyway , before they got me . JAY Well , you could , maybe , if you was to fix a bail bond . You 'd take bail for him , would n't you , Judge ? JUDGE BRADFORD It 's a felony ; I 'd have to have good security . CROSBY I 'm a rich woman , you said just now . Could I give bail for him ? JUDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't enough . You want all us Jordans fawnin ' on you for favors . Well , all of ' em but me will ; by mornin ' the buzzards will be flocking round you thick ! You 're going to hear a lot about how much folks love you , but you ai n't goin ' to hear it from me . CROSBY turns to him quietly . Why did you come here , Ben , when I wrote you she was dying ? BEN Why did I come ? CROSBY Was it because you loved her , because you wanted to ask her to forgive you , before she died  --  or was it because you wanted to get something for yourself ? p. 36 BEN hesitates . How does a feller know why he does what he does ? CROSBY I 'm just curious . You 've got so much contempt for the rest , I was just wondering ? You were wild , Ben , and hard , but you were honest  --  what brought you here BEN sulkily . The money . CROSBY I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even then the money was in your mind  --  well  --  it 's mine now . And you 've got to take your choice ,  --  you can do what I tell you , or you 'll go with Mr. Jay . BEN Is that so ? Well , I guess there ai n't much doubt about what I 'll do . Come on , JIM ! JAY All right . He takes a pair of handcuffs from his pocket . You 'll have to slip these on , Ben . BEN steps back . No  --  wait  --  He turns desperately to Jane . What is it you want ? CROSBY I want you to do as I say . BEN after a look at JIM and the handcuffs . I 'll do it . CROSBY I thought so . She turns to JUDGE . Can you fix the bond up here ? p. 37 JUDGE BRADFORD Yes . He sits at table and takes pen , ink and paper from a drawer . I can hold court right here long enough for that . JAY This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He puts warrant on table . CROSBY First he 's got to swear , before you , to my conditions . BEN What conditions ? CROSBY When will his trial be , Judge ? JUDGE BRADFORD Not before the spring term , I should think  --  say early April . CROSBY You 'll stay here till then , Ben ; you wo n't leave town ! You 'll work the farm ,  --  there 's plenty to be done . BEN sulkily . I do n't know how to work a farm . CROSBY I do . You 'll just do what I tell you . BEN Be your slave ? That 's what you mean , ai n't it ? CROSBY I 've been about that here for eight years . BEN And now it 's your turn to get square on a Jordan ! CROSBY You 'll work for once , and work every day . The first day you do n't I 'll surrender you to the Judge , and he 'll jail you . The rest of the Jordans will live as I tell them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives , they 'll live on what they earn . Do n't forget , Ben , that right now I 'm the head of the family . p. 38 JUDGE BRADFORD to BEN . You heard the conditions ? Shall I make out the bond ? BEN reluctantly . Yes . He sits moodily at right , looking down at the floor . JANE looks at him for a moment , then turns up to window . CROSBY It 's snowing ! JAY Thought I smelled it . He buttons his coat . Well , nothin ' to keep me , is there , Judge ? JUDGE BRADFORD No . He starts to write out the bond with a rusty pen . This pen is rusty ! JAY I was sorry to hear about the old lady . It 's too bad , but that 's the way of things . JUDGE BRADFORD writes . Yes . JAY Well  --  It 's early for snow , not but what it 's a good thing for the winter wheat . He exits. @x SCENE . Sitting room of the Jordan Homestead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces of a family 's daily life , and to that extent is less desolate than the " parlor " of the first act , although the stern faith of the Puritan makes no concession to the thing we have learned to call " good taste . " The old-fashioned simplicity seen in such a room as this has resulted from poverty , both of mind and of purse , and has nothing akin to the simplicity of the artist ; as a matter of fact , your true descendants of the settlers of 1605 would be the first to resent such an implication ; to them the arts are directly connected with heathen practices , and any incense burned before the altars of the Graces still smells to them of brimstone . At back center folding doors , now partly open , lead to dining room . In this room may be seen the dining table , back of the table a window looking out on to the farm yard , now deep in midwinter snow . At right is an open fireplace with a log fire . Below fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestibule in which is the outside door . Down left a window overlooking a snowbound countryside . The clock above the fireplace is set for quarter past four . Several straight-backed chairs and a woodbox by fireplace . A sewing table and lamp at center . A sewing machine near window at left . A wall cupboard on the wall right of the doors to the dining room . An old sofa down left , two chairs at right . When the door at left , in vestibule , is opened , one may see a path up to the door , between two walls of snow . Discovered : ELLA sits right at sewing machine , hemming some rough towels . ORIN and NETTIE are by fireplace . SADIE sits right of center . SADIE and ORIN are dressed for outdoors . NETTIE 'S coat , hat and overshoes are on a hatrack by door at left . ORIN , as the curtain goes up , is putting a log on the fire . FELLOWS acidly to ELLA.Why should n't he put wood on the fire if he wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wood . FELLOWS No , it 's hers ! Everything is hers ! ELLA And maybe she just do n't know it . NETTIE at fireplace.Ah ! She bends closer to the fire as the log blazes up . I do love a good fire ! Oh it 's nice to be warm ! FELLOWS There 's somethin ' sensual about it . NETTIE Mother told me that the next time you started talkin ' indecent I was to leave the room . FELLOWS Tell your mother I do n't wonder she 's sort of worried about you . I 'd be if you was my daughter . ELLA I do n't see why you ca n't let Nettie alone ! NETTIE She 's always picking on me , Aunt Ella ! To hear her talk anybody would think I was terrible . FELLOWS I know more about what 's going on than some folks think I do . NETTIE Then you know a lot . I heard Horace Bevins say a week ago that he did n't know as it was any use tryin ' to have a Masonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was a Bevins yet did n't have his tongue hung from the middle ; the day his mother was married she answered both the responses . p. 41 ORIN Mum ! Mum ! Shall I take my coat off ; are we going to stay , Mum ? FELLOWS No , we ai n't going to stay . I just want to see Cousin Jane for a minute ELLA She 's in the kitchen with Hannah . FELLOWS Watchin ' her , I bet ! I wonder Hannah puts up with it . ELLA If you was to live with Jane for a spell , I guess you 'd find you had a plenty to put up with . FELLOWS It 's enough to make the Jordans turn in their graves , all of ' em at once . ELLA I guess all she 'd say would be , " Let ' em if it seemed to make ' em any more comfortable . " JANE enters . She has apron on and some towels over her arm CROSBY Are those towels finished ? ELLA Some is ! Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a centipede . CROSBY Oh ! I did n't see you , Sadie . FELLOWS Oh ! Ha , ha ! Well , I ai n't surprised . CROSBY with ELLA , selecting finished towels.Well , Orin , does the tooth still hurt you ? ORIN Naw , it do n't hurt me none now . I got it in a bottle . He takes small bottle from pocket. p. 42 NETTIE Oh , you nasty thing . You get away ! FELLOWS angrily. What did I tell you about showin ' that tooth to folks ! CROSBY Never mind , Orin , just run out to the barn and tell your Uncle Ben we 've got to have a path cleared under the clotheslines . ORIN All right . He crosses toward door . CROSBY Hannah 's going to wash tomorrow , tell him . I 'll expect a good wide path . ORIN I 'll tell him . He exits . FELLOWS I must say you keep Ben right at it , do n't you ? CROSBY Yes . She takes the last finished towel and speaks to ELLA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses.First I thought he 'd go to jail before he 'd work , but he did n't , did he ? CROSBY No . She exits right . FELLOWS Yes . No ! Yes . No ! Folks that ai n't got no more gift of gab ai n't got much gift of intellect . I s'pose Hannah 's out there . ELLA Yes , she keeps all of us just everlastingly at it . p. 43 FELLOWS When Jane comes back , I wish you and Nettie would leave me alone with her , just for a minute . ELLA as she works over sewing machine.It wo n't do you much good ; she wo n't lend any more money . FELLOWS Mother always helped me . I 've got a right to expect it . ELLA as she bites off a thread.Expectin ' ai n't gettin ' . FELLOWS I do n't know what I 'll do . ELLA You had money out of her ; so has Henry . FELLOWS shocked.You do n't mean to say your father 's been borrowin ' from her . This to NETTIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he borrow the hundred dollars grandma left me ? I 'm not going to stand it much longer . ELLA Henry 's havin ' trouble with his business . FELLOWS We 're fools to put up with it . Everybody says so . We ought to contest the will . ELLA Everybody says so but the lawyers ; they wo n't none of ' em touch the case without they get money in advance . FELLOWS How much money ? Did n't your father find out , Nettie ? p. 44 NETTIE The least was five hundred dollars . ELLA Can you see us raisin ' that ? FELLOWS If we was short , we might borrow it from Jane . ELLA We 'd have to be smarter'n I see any signs of ; she 's through lendin ' . FELLOWS How do you know ? ELLA I tried it myself . FELLOWS What do you want money for ? Ai n't she takin ' you in to live with her ? ELLA I do n't call myself beholden for that . She had to have someone , with Ben here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . NETTIE Everybody 's callin ' you the chaperon ! She laughs . Not but what they ought to be one with him around ; he 's awful good lookin ' . FELLOWS You keep away from him . He 's no blood kin of yours , and he 's a bad man , if he is a Jordan . Always makes up to everything he sees in petticoats , and always did . NETTIE Thanks for the compliment , but I 'm not looking for any jailbirds . ELLA It will be awful , Ben in State 's Prison ,  --  and I guess he 'll have to go , soon as he stands his trial . p. 45 FELLOWS He got drunk and had a fight with the two Kimbal boys , and they licked him , and that night he burned down their barn ; everybody knows it . ELLA He 's bad , all through , Ben is . NETTIE He 'll get about five years , father says . I guess that will take some of the spunk out of him . A sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's coming . BEN enters at right with a big armful of firewood and crosses and drops it heavily into woodbox , then turns and looks at them in silence . FELLOWS Seems kind of funny , your luggin ' in the wood . BEN bitterly.Does it ? FELLOWS Did you see Orin out there ? BEN Yes , he went along home . FELLOWS How do you like workin ' ? BEN How do you think I like it ? Workin ' a big farm in winter , tendin ' the stock and milking ten cows . How do I like it ? As he stands by fire NETTIE looks up at him . NETTIE I think it 's just a shame ! FELLOWS turns to ELLA.Are you going to make towels all the afternoon ? p. 46 ELLA I am ' til they 're done , then I expect she 'll find somethin ' else for me to do . NETTIE to BEN.Do you know I 'm sorry for you , awful sorry ? She speaks low . ELLA and SADIE are at the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NETTIE Maybe I am , but I 'm like that . BEN Another month of it , then State 's Prison , I guess . I do n't know as I 'll be sorry when the time comes . NETTIE Oh , Uncle Ben ! No , I 'm not goin ' to call you that . After all , you 're not really any relation , are you ? I mean to me ? BEN No . NETTIE softly.I 'm just going to call you Ben ! BEN You 're a good kid , Nettie . NETTIE Oh , it is n't that , Ben , but it does just seem too awful . As she looks up at him , the outside door opens and HENRY and EMMA enter . They see NETTIE and BEN together by the fire . EMMA sternly.Nettie ! NETTIE sweetly.Yes , mother ? p. 47 EMMA You come away from him . BEN angrily. What do you mean by that ? EMMA You tell him , Henry . HENRY I do n't know as it 's any use to  --  EMMA sternly.Tell him what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it 's best Nettie should n't talk to you . BEN Why do n't you keep her at home then ? You do n't suppose I want to talk to her . EMMA Oh , we ai n't wanted here , I guess . We know that , not by you , or by her ;  --  and Henry 's the oldest of the Jordans . All this would be his , if there was any justice in the world . NETTIE Father would n't have taken that hundred dollars grandma left me if there had been any justice in the world . That 's what I came here for , not to talk to him . To tell Cousin Jane what father did , and to tell her about Nellie Namlin 's Christmas party , and that I 've got to have a new dress . I 've just got to ! FELLOWS A new dress , and my rent ai n't paid . She 's got to pay it . My Orin 's got to have a roof over his head . p. 48 HENRY I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pestering Jane all the time . ELLA She 's always wantin ' something . FELLOWS What about you ? Did n't you tell me yourself you tried to borrow from her ? ELLA I got a chance to set up in business , so as I can be independent . I can go in with Mary Stanton , dressmakin ' . I can do it for two hundred dollars , and she 's got to give it to me . HENRY You ought to be ashamed , all three of you , worryin ' Jane all day long . It 's more'n flesh and blood can stand ! NETTIE to him.Did n't you say at breakfast you was coming here today to make Cousin Jane endorse a note for you ? Did n't you ? EMMA fiercely.You hush ! BEN at back by window.Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Crow buzzards . HENRY Endorsing a note ai n't lending money , is it ? It 's a matter of business . I guess my note 's good . BEN Take it to the bank without her name on it and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to ask her favors , but Henry 's in bad trouble and she 'll just have to help us this time . p. 49 BEN There 's one way out of your troubles . One thing you could all do , for a change , instead of making Jane pay all your bills . I wonder you have n't any of you thought of it . HENRY What could we do ? BEN Go to work and earn something for yourselves . FELLOWS Like you do , I suppose . EMMA The laughing-stock of all Veazie ! ELLA Everybody 's talkin ' about it , anywhere you go . NETTIE Jane Crosby 's White Slave , that 's what they call you . Jane Crosby 's White Slave . BEN fiercely.They call me that , do they ? ELLA to NETTIE.Why ca n't you ever hold your tongue ? BEN in cold anger.I 've been a damned fool . I 'm through . HANNAH enters HANNAH She wants you . BEN Jane ? HANNAH Yes . BEN I wo n't come . HANNAH There 'll be another row . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . He sits . HANNAH She 's awful set , you know , when she wants anything . BEN You tell her I wo n't come . HANNAH Well , I do n't say I hanker none to tell her , but I 'd rather be in my shoes than yourn . She exits . FELLOWS Well , I must say I do n't blame you a mite . EMMA If the Jordans is a lot of slaves , I guess it 's pretty near time we knew it . HENRY worried.She 'll turn you over to Judge Bradford , Ben ; he 'll lock you up . It ai n't goin ' to help me none with the bank , a brother of mine bein ' in jail . BEN So they 're laughing at me , are they , damn them ! NETTIE at door right.She 's coming ! There is a moment 's pause and JANE enters door right . HANNAH follows to door and looks on eagerly . CROSBY I sent for you , Ben . BEN I wo n't budge . CROSBY wearily.Must we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to move out of this chair today . You do what you damned please . CROSBY I am sorry , but you must . BEN Send for Jim Jay , have me locked up , do as you please . Oh , I 've said it before , but this time I mean it . CROSBY And you wo n't come ? BEN No . CROSBY Then I 'll do the best I can alone . She crosses up to wall closet and opens it and selects a large bottle , and turns . BEN rises quickly . BEN What do you want of that ? CROSBY It 's one of the horses . I do n't know what 's the matter with her . She 's down in her stall , just breathing . She wo n't pay any attention to me . BEN Old Nellie ? CROSBY Yes . BEN What you got ? He steps to her and takes the bottle from her and looks at it . That stuff 's no good . Here ! He steps to cabinet and selects another bottle . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have had a better chance . He exits quickly at left . HANNAH I allers said ' t was easier to catch flies with honey than ' t was with vinegar . p. 52 HENRY What 's Ben know about horses ? CROSBY A lot . HENRY I did n't know that . CROSBY Neither did Ben , six weeks ago . She exits . HENRY Mother was like that , about animals . I guess Ben sort of takes after her . EMMA shocked.Ben ! Like your mother ! HANNAH Of course he is . He 's the " spit and image of her . " She exits . NETTIE She made him go ! It would n't surprise me a mite if she 'd pushed that old horse over herself . JANE enters CROSBY He would n't let me in the barn . For the first time in the play , she laughs lightly . Well  --  She looks about at them. we have quite a family gathering here this afternoon . I am wondering if there is any  --  special reason for it ? HENRY I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FELLOWS So do I. CROSBY Anybody else ? She looks about. p. 53 ELLA I do . NETTIE So do I. CROSBY I 've a lot to do ; suppose I answer you all at once . I 'm sorry , but I wo n't lend you any money . HENRY Of course , I did n't think they 'd call that note of mine ; it 's only five hundred , and you could just endorse it . CROSBY No ! FELLOWS I was going to ask you  --  CROSBY No ! ELLA I got a chance to be independent , Jane , and  --  CROSBY No . I have n't any money . I wo n't have before the first of the month . EMMA No money ! HENRY I bet you 're worth as much today as you was the day mother died . CROSBY To a penny . I 've lived , and run this house , and half supported all of you on what I 've made the place earn . Yesterday I spent the first dollar that I did n't have to spend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of yours . I am worth just as much as the day I took the property , and I 'm not going to run behind , so you see , after all , I 'm a real Jordan . EMMA Seems so . I never knew one of ' em yet who did n't seem to think he could take it with him . p. 54 HENRY Well , Jane , I do n't know as it 's any use tryin ' to get you to change your mind ? CROSBY I 'm sorry . EMMA You can leave that for us to be . I guess it 's about the only thing we 've got a right to . Get your things on , Nettie ! NETTIE I 'm going to stay a while with Aunt Ella ; I wo n't be late . HENRY I do n't know what I 'm goin ' to do about that note . I s'pose I 'll find some way out of it . CROSBY I hope so . EMMA Thank yer . Of course we know there 's always the poorhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the outside door open . HENRY Emma is a little upset . I hope you wo n't mind her talk . I guess her part of it ai n't any too easy . He exits , shutting the door . ELLA to JANE.Poor Henry ! Of course I s'pose you 're right not to lend it to him . But I do n't know as I could do it , but I 'm sensitive . CROSBY Perhaps it 's harder to say no than you think . HANNAH enters HANNAH I got everything ready for tomorrow 's wash , but the sheets off your bed , Miss Ella. p. 55 ELLA Good Land ! I forgot ' em . Nettie will bring ' em right down . NETTIE to JANE.After that , I 'm going to stay and help Aunt Ella . I was wondering if you 'd be here all the afternoon . CROSBY Yes . NETTIE charmingly.Nothing special , you know . I 'd just like to have a little visit with you . She exits at left with ELLA . HANNAH looks after her.Every time I listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROSBY Fur ? HANNAH Like when my dyspepsia 's coming . There 's two things I ca n't abide , her and cucumbers . She crosses to door left . CROSBY Hannah ! HANNAH stops.Well ? CROSBY rather shyly.We are going to have rather a special supper tonight . HANNAH doubtfully.We are ? CROSBY Yes . That 's why I had you roast that turkey yesterday . p. 56 HANNAH firmly.That 's for Sunday ! CROSBY No , it 's for tonight . HANNAH angrily.Why is it ? CROSBY It 's my birthday . HANNAH I did n't know that . CROSBY No , it is n't exactly a national holiday , but we 'll have the turkey , and I 'll get some preserves up , and I want you to bake a cake , a round one . We 'll have candles on it . I got some at the store this morning . HANNAH shocked.Candles ? CROSBY Yes . HANNAH Who 's going to be to this party ? CROSBY a little self-conscious.Why  --  just  --  just ourselves . HANNAH Just you and Mr. Ben and Miss Ella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that cake , you want crape on it . She exits door left . JANE crosses up and starts to clear the dining-room table of its red table cover , as BEN enters door left. p. 57 BEN cheerfully.Well , I fixed Old Nellie up . He puts his bottle back in its place in the wall cabinet . Just got her in time . Thought she was gone for a minute , but she 's going to be all right . CROSBY That 's good . She folds the tablecloth up and puts it away . BEN in front of fire.She knew what I was doin ' for her too ; you could tell by the way she looked at me ! She 'll be all right , poor old critter . I remember her when she was a colt , year before I went to high school . JANE crosses into room , shutting the dining-room door after her . CROSBY You like animals , do n't you , Ben ? BEN surprised.I do n't know . I do n't like to see ' em suffer . CROSBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't to blame for it . I mean what comes to ' em ai n't their fault . If a woman thinks she 's sick , ' til she gets sick , that 's her business . If a man gets drunk , or eats like a hog , he 's got to pay for it , and he ought to . Animals live cleaner than we do anyhow  --  and when you do anything for ' em they 've got gratitude . Folks haven't. p. 58 CROSBY Hand me that sewing basket , Ben . She has seated herself at left center by table . BEN at left of table , hands her the basket as she picks up some sewing . BEN It 's funny , but except for a dog or two , I do n't remember carin ' nothin ' for any of the live things , when I lived here I mean . CROSBY I guess that 's because you did n't do much for them . BEN I guess so  --  Sometimes I kind of think I 'd like to be here when spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world  --  I should think there 'd be a lot a feller could do , to make it easier for ' em . CROSBY Yes . BEN Everybody 's always makin ' a fuss over women and their babies . I guess animals have got some feelings , too . CROSBY sewing.Yes . BEN I know it  --  Yes , sometimes I sort of wish I could be here , in the spring . CROSBY You 'll be a big help . BEN I 'll be in prison . He looks at her . She drops her head and goes on sewing . You forgot that , did n't yer ? CROSBY Yes . p. 59 BEN What 's the difference ? A prison ai n't just a place ; it 's bein ' somewheres you do n't want to be , and that 's where I 've always been . CROSBY You liked the Army ? BEN I s'pose so . CROSBY Why ? BEN I do n't know , there was things to do , and you did ' em . CROSBY And some one to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody that knew better'n I did . It galled me at first , but pretty soon we got over in France , an ' I saw we was really doin ' something , then I did n't mind . I just got to doin ' what I was told , and it worked out all right . CROSBY You liked France , too ? BEN Yes . CROSBY I 'd like to hear you tell about it . BEN Maybe I 'll go back there some time . I do n't know as I 'd mind farming a place over there . Most of their farms are awful little , but I do n't know but what I 'd like it . CROSBY Farming is farming . Why not try it here ? BEN Look out there ! He points out of the window at the drifted snow . It 's like that half the year , froze up , everything , most of all the people . Just a family by itself , maybe . Just a few folks , good an ' bad , month after month , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , that really do n't amount to nothin ' , but get to be bigger than all the world outside . p. 60 CROSBY sewing.Somebody must do the farming , Ben . BEN Somebody like the Jordans , that 's been doin ' it generation after generation . Well , look at us . I heard a feller , in a Y. M. C. A. hut , tellin ' how nature brought animals into the world , able to face what they had to face  --  CROSBY Yes , Ben ? BEN That 's what nature 's done for us Jordans ,  --  brought us into the world half froze before we was born . Brought us into the world mean , and hard , so 's we could live the hard , mean life we have to live . CROSBY I do n't know , Ben , but what you could live it different . BEN They laugh over there , and sing , and God knows when I was there they did n't have much to sing about . I was at a rest camp , near Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French lady with all those children that I got billeted with . CROSBY Yes . BEN They used to sing , right at the table , and laugh ! God ! It brought a lump into my throat more'n once , lookin ' at them , and rememberin ' the Jordans ! CROSBY I guess there was n't much laughing at your family table . BEN Summers nobody had much time for it , and winters ,  --  well , I guess you know . p. 61 CROSBY Yes . BEN Just a few folks together , day after day , and every little thing you do n't like about the other raspin ' on your nerves ' til it almost drives you crazy ! Most folks quiet , because they 've said all the things they 've got to say a hundred times ; other folks talkin ' , talkin ' , talkin ' about nothing . Sometimes somebody sort of laughs , and it scares you ; seems like laughter needs the sun , same as flowers do . Icebound , that 's what we are , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly out window . CROSBY Not all . I laughed a lot before I came here to live . BEN turns and looks at her . I remember , you were just a little girl . CROSBY I was fourteen . See if there 's a spool of black sewing cotton in that drawer . BEN looking in drawer.You mean thread ? CROSBY Yes . BEN This it ? He holds up a spool of white thread . CROSBY Would you call that black ? BEN looks it over.No  --  it ai n't black . He searches and finds black thread . Maybe this is it ! p. 62 CROSBY Maybe it is ! She takes it . You were with that French family quite a while , were n't you ? BEN Most a month ; they was well off , you know ; I mean , they was , before the war . It was a nice house . CROSBY sewing.How nice ? BEN hesitates.I do n't know , things  --  well  --  useful , you know , but nice , not like this . He looks about . CROSBY looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be . I could make it . BEN If you did , folks would be sayin ' you was n't respectable . CROSBY Tell me about the dinner they gave you the night before you went back to your company . BEN I told you . CROSBY Tell me again . BEN smiles to himself at the remembrance.They was all dressed up , the whole family , and there I was with just my dirty old uniform . CROSBY Yes . BEN lost in his recollections.It was a fine dinner , but it was n't that . It was their doin ' so much for me , folks like that  --  I 've sort of pictured ' em lots of times since then . p. 63 CROSBY Go on . BEN All of the young ones laughing and happy , and the mother too , laughing and tryin ' to talk to me , and neither one of us knowing much about what the other one was sayin ' . He and JANE both laugh . CROSBY And the oldest daughter ? The one that was most grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know as ever I 've seen a girl like her , before or since . CROSBY Maybe ' t was that dress you told me about ; seems to me you do n't remember much else about her ; not so much as what color her hair was , only just that that dress was blue . BEN thoughtfully.Yes . CROSBY sewing.Sometimes you say dark blue ! She is watching him closely through half-shut eyes . BEN absently.I guess so . CROSBY And then I say , dark as something I point out to you , that is n't dark at all , and you say , " No , lighter than that ! " BEN absently.Just  --  sort of blue . CROSBY Yes , sort of blue . It had lace on it , too , did n't it ? p. 64 BEN Lace ? Maybe  --  yes , lace . CROSBY There 's more than one blue dress in the world . BEN Like enough . Maybe there 's more'n one family like that lady 's , but I 'll be damned if they live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle . I might as well run out and see how the old mare is getting on . He selects bottle from shelf . CROSBY And you 've got to shovel those paths for the clothes-lines yet . BEN I know . CROSBY Well , do n't forget . BEN It ai n't likely you 'll let me . He exits at door right . JANE laughs softly to herself , and runs to closet and takes out a large cardboard box and putting it on the table , she cuts the string and removes the wrapping paper , then lifts the cover of the box and draws out a dainty light-blue gown with soft lace on the neck and sleeves . She holds it up joyfully , then , covering her own dress with it , she looks at herself in a mirror on wall . As she stands smiling at her reflection , there is a sharp knock on the outside door . JANE hastily returns dress to box and as the knock is repeated , she puts the box under the sofa at left and crosses and opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , it 's you , Judge ! Come in . JUDGE BRADFORD I thought I 'd stop on my way home and see how you were getting on , Jane . CROSBY I 'll take your coat . JUDGE BRADFORD I 'll just put it here . He puts coat on chair . Have you time to sit down a minute ? CROSBY Of course . They sit . JUDGE BRADFORD looks at her.That is n't a smile on your lips , is it , Jane ? CROSBY Maybe  --  JUDGE BRADFORD laughingly.I 'm glad I came ! CROSBY It 's my birthday . JUDGE BRADFORD Why , Jane ! He crosses to her and holds out his hand . She takes it . Many happy returns ! CROSBY thoughtfully.Many  --  happy returns  --  that 's a lot to ask for . JUDGE BRADFORD You 're about twenty-two , or twenty-three , are n't you ? CROSBY Twenty-three . JUDGE BRADFORD Time enough ahead of you . His eye falls on the box , imperfectly hidden under the sofa ; out of it a bit of the blue dress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66 CROSBY My birthday present . JUDGE BRADFORD Who gave it to you ? CROSBY I did . JUDGE BRADFORD Good ! It 's about time you started to blossom out . CROSBY I ordered a lot of things from Boston ; they 'll be here tomorrow . JUDGE BRADFORD I suppose that one 's a dress ? CROSBY Yes . JUDGE BRADFORD bends over to look.Light blue , is n't it ? CROSBY smiles.Just sort of blue  --  with lace on it . JUDGE BRADFORD Oh , you 're going to wear it , I suppose , in honor of your birthday ? CROSBY startled.Tonight  --  oh , no  --  soon maybe , but not tonight . JUDGE BRADFORD smiles.How soon ? CROSBY Soon as I dare to ; not just yet . JUDGE BRADFORD You have plenty of money ; you ought to have every comfort in the world , and some of the luxuries . CROSBY gravely.Judge ! I want you to do something for me. p. 67 JUDGE BRADFORD And of course I 'll do it . CROSBY I want you to get Ben off . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to State 's Prison . JUDGE BRADFORD But if he 's guilty , Jane ? CROSBY I want you to go to old Mr. Kimbal for me and offer to pay him for that barn of his that Ben burned down . Then I want you to fix it so he wo n't push the case , so 's Ben gets off . JUDGE BRADFORD Do you know what you are asking of me ? CROSBY To get Ben off . JUDGE BRADFORD To compound a felony . CROSBY Those are just words , Judge , and words do n't matter much to me . I might say I was n't asking you to compound a felony , I was askin ' you to save a sinner , but those would be just words too . There 's nobody else ; you 've got to help me . JUDGE BRADFORD thoughtfully.I 've always thought a lot could be done for Ben , by a good lawyer . CROSBY It does n't matter how , so long as it 's done . JUDGE BRADFORD He was drinking , with a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat him up rather badly . That 's about all we know , aside from the fact that Ben was drunk , and that that night the Kimbals ' barn was set on fire . p. 68 CROSBY Just so long as you can get him off , Judge . JUDGE BRADFORD I think a case of assault could be made against the Kimbal boys , and I think it would stand . CROSBY What of it ? JUDGE BRADFORD It is quite possible that the old man , if he knew that action was to be taken against his sons , and if he could be tactfully assured of payment for his barn , say by Ben , in a year 's time , might be persuaded to petition to have the indictment against Ben withdrawn . In that event , I think the chances would be very much in Ben 's favor . CROSBY I do n't care what names you call it , so long as it 's done . Will you fix it ? JUDGE BRADFORD Well , it 's not exactly a proper proceeding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd do it . JUDGE BRADFORD Yes , and I think you knew why , did n't you ? CROSBY Ever since she 's died , you 've helped me about everything . Before she died you were just as good to me , and nobody else was . JUDGE BRADFORD I am glad you said that , because it clears me from the charge of being what poor Ben calls " one of the crow buzzards , " and I do n't want you to think me that . p. 69 CROSBY No , you 're not that . JUDGE BRADFORD I love you , Jane . CROSBY No ! JUDGE BRADFORD Yes  --  I 've done that for a long while . Do n't you think you could get used to the thought of being my wife ? CROSBY gently.No . JUDGE BRADFORD I think I could make you happy . CROSBY No . JUDGE BRADFORD I am afraid being happy is something you do n't know very much about . CROSBY No . JUDGE BRADFORD It is n't a thing that I am going to hurry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that I am going to give up hoping for . CROSBY When you told me , that day , that Mrs. Jordan had left me all her money , I could n't understand ; then , afterwards , you gave me the letter she left for me . I want you to read it . JUDGE BRADFORD What has her letter to do with us ? CROSBY Maybe , reading it , you 'll get to know something you 've got a right to know , better than I could tell it to you . JUDGE BRADFORD Very well . p. 70 CROSBY It 's here . She opens drawer , and selects a letter in a woman 's old-fashioned handwriting , from a large envelope of papers . She was a cold woman , Judge . She never let me get close to her , although I tried . She did n't love me . I was as sure of it then as I am now . She holds out the letter . Read it . JUDGE BRADFORD If it 's about the thing I 've been speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROSBY reads . " My dear Jane , the doctor tells me I have n't long to live , and so I 'm doing this , the meanest thing I think I 've ever done to you . I 'm leaving you the Jordan money . Since my husband died , there has been just one person I could get to care about ; that 's Ben , who was my baby so long after all the others had forgotten how to love me . And Ben 's a bad son , and a bad man . I ca n't leave him the money ; he 'd squander it , and the Jordans ' money came hard . " JUDGE BRADFORD Poor woman ! It was a bitter thing for her to have to write like that . CROSBY reads on . " If squandering the money would bring him happiness , I 'd face all the Jordans in the other world and laugh at them , but I know there 's only just one chance to save my boy ,  --  through a woman who will hold out her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has on mine . " p. 71 JUDGE BRADFORD in sudden fear.Jane ! CROSBY reads on . " Who 'd work , and pray , and live for him , until as age comes on , and maybe he gets a little tired , he 'll turn to her . And you 're that woman , Jane ; you 've loved him ever since you came to us . Although he does n't even know it . The Jordan name is his , the money 's yours , and maybe there 'll be another life for you to guard . God knows it is n't much I 'm leaving you , but you ca n't refuse it , because you love him , and when he knows the money is yours , he will want to marry you . I 'm a wicked old woman . Maybe you 'll learn to forgive me as time goes on  --  It takes a long time to make a Jordan . " Jane drops her hand to her side . Then she just signed her name . JUDGE BRADFORD Is the damnable thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDGE BRADFORD And you 're going to do this thing for her ? CROSBY No , for him . JUDGE BRADFORD bitterly.He is n't worth it . CROSBY I guess you do n't understand . JUDGE BRADFORD ' No . He crosses and picks up his coat. p. 72 CROSBY You ca n't go like that , angry . You have to pay a price for being a good man , Judge  --  I need your help . JUDGE BRADFORD You mean he needs my help ? CROSBY Yes , and you 'll have to give it to him , if what you said a little while ago was true . JUDGE BRADFORD after a pause.It was true , Jane . I 'll help him . He picks up his hat . CROSBY I 've an errand at the store . I 'll go with you . She takes hat and coat from rack and puts them on . JUDGE BRADFORD Is it anything I could have sent up for you ? CROSBY putting on coat.I guess not . You see , I 've got to match a color . JUDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ribbon , for my hair . JUDGE BRADFORD I did n't know women still wore ribbons in their hair . CROSBY It seems they do  --  in France . They exit together at left to the outside door and off . NETTIE and ELLA enter quickly , after a slight pause , NETTIE running in from right , followed more sedately by ELLA p. 73 NETTIE You see ! I was right ! She went with him . She has run to window left and is looking out . ELLA That 's what money does . If mother had n't left her everything , he would n't have touched her with a ten-foot pole . NETTIE Well , if she 's fool enough to stay in this place , I guess he 's about the best there is . ELLA Then trust her for gettin ' him ; by the time she gets through in Veazie , this town will be barer than Mother Hubbard 's cupboard by the time the dog got there . Her eye falls on JANE 'S box , partly under sofa . What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? ELLA I never saw it before . She draws it out . Looks like a dress . See ! Blue silk ! NETTIE Open it . ELLA hesitates.Must be hers ! Maybe she would n't like it . NETTIE Maybe she would n't know it . ELLA A cat can look at a king ! She opens the box and holds up the blue dress . NETTIE Oh ! Oh ! p. 74 ELLA really moved.Some folks would say a dress like that was n't decent , but I would n't care , not if it was mine , and it might have been mine  --  but for her . NETTIE Yours ! Grandma would n't have left her money to you . She hated old people . Everybody does . She 'd have left it to me , but for Jane Crosby ! ELLA looks at dress.I always wanted a dress like this ; when I was young , I used to dream about one , but mother only laughed . For years I counted on gettin ' me what I wanted , when she died ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLA Maybe , but not me . Oh , if I could have the feelin ' of a dress like that on me , if I could wear it once , where folks could see me  --  Just once ! Oh , I know how they 'd laugh  --  I would n't care  --  NETTIE almost in tears.I ca n't stand it if she 's going to wear things like that . ELLA I 'll put it back . She starts to do so . NETTIE catches her hand.Not yet . ELLA I guess the less we look at it , the better off we 'll be . There is a ring at the front door. p. 75 NETTIE Who 's that ? ELLA Here ! She hands the box to NETTIE . Shove it back under the sofa . I 'll go and see . She turns and crosses to door left and out to the vestibule . NETTIE , with the box in her arms , hesitates for a moment then turns and exits at right taking the box with her . ELLA opens the outside door at left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him angrily . For time 's sake , what are you ringing the bell for ? ORIN Mum says for me not to act like I belonged here . ELLA Well , I 'm goin ' to shut the door . Git in or git out ! ORIN I got a note . He enters room as ELLA shuts door . It 's for her . ELLA holds out hand.Let me see it . ORIN Mum said not to let on I had nothin ' if you came nosin ' around . JANE enters from left CROSBY I just ran across to the store . I have n't been five minutes . She takes coat off . ELLA He 's got a note for you , from Sadie . p. 76 CROSBY Oh , let me see it , Orin . ORIN gives her note.She said , if you said is they an answer , I was to say yes , they is . CROSBY Just a minute . She opens note and reads it . ELLA I must say she did n't lose much time . CROSBY after reading note.Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes checkbook from the drawer and writes . Just take this to your mother . ELLA You do n't mean you 're goin ' to  --  CROSBY Be quiet , Ella . Here , Orin . She hands him check . Do n't lose it , and run along . ORIN All right . Mum said we was goin ' to have dinner early , and go to a movie ! Good night . CROSBY again writing in checkbook.Good night . ORIN exits . ELLA So you sent her her rent money , after all ? CROSBY Here ! She rises and hands a check to ELLA . ELLA What 's that ? p. 77 CROSBY Two hundred dollars . You can try that dressmaking business if you want to , Ella . ELLA looks at check.Two hundred dollars ! CROSBY You need n't thank me . ELLA That ai n't it . I was just wonderin ' what 's come over you all of a sudden . BEN enters CROSBY It 's my birthday , that 's all . Did you know it was my birthday , Ben ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He crosses and sits by fire . CROSBY Ella 's going into the dressmaking business , Ben . BEN moodily.What of it ? ELLA That 's what I say . It ai n't much of a business . She exits at right ; outside it grows to dusk . CROSBY Are you tired ? BEN Maybe . He stretches his feet out toward fire . CROSBY You 've done a lot of work today . BEN And every day . p. 78 CROSBY I do n't suppose you know how much good it 's done you , how well you look ! BEN Beauty 's only skin deep . CROSBY Folks change , even in a few weeks , outside and in . Hard work do n't hurt anybody . BEN I got chilblains on my feet . The damned shoes are stiffer than they ever was . CROSBY Icebound , you said . Maybe it do n't have to be like that . Sometimes , just lately , it 's seemed to me that if folks would try , things need n't be so bad . All of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else . BEN If I was you , I 'd go out somewheres and hire a hall . CROSBY If you 'd put some pork fat on those shoes tonight , your feet would n't hurt so bad . BEN Maybe . He sits looking moodily into the fire . After a moment 's hesitation , JANE crosses and sits in the chair beside his . The evening shadows deepen around them but the glow from the fire lights their faces . CROSBY I 'm lonesome tonight . We always made a lot of birthdays when I was a girl . BEN Some do . CROSBY Your mother did n't . She found me once trying , the day I was fifteen . I remember how she laughed at me. p. 79 BEN All the Jordans have got a sense of humor . CROSBY She was n't a Jordan , not until she married your father . BEN When a woman marries into a family , she mostly shuts her eyes and jumps in all over . CROSBY Your mother was the best of the whole lot of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I always thought a lot of her , in spite of our being relations . CROSBY She loved you , Ben . BEN She left me without a dollar , knowin ' I was going to State 's Prison , and what I 'd be by the time I get out . CROSBY Maybe some day you 'll understand why she did it . BEN Because she thought you 'd take better care of the money than any of the rest of us . CROSBY And you hate me because of that , the way all the rest of the Jordans do ? BEN Sometimes . CROSBY sadly.I suppose it 's natural . BEN But I ai n't such a fool as Henry , and the women folks . They think you took advantage and fooled her into what she did . I thought so at first , now I don't. p. 80 CROSBY What do you think now , Ben ? BEN She 'd watched you ; she knew you were worth more'n all of us in a lump . I know it , too , but some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROSBY That 's silly ! BEN with growing resentment.Do n't you suppose I know what you 've been doin ' to me ? Tryin ' to make a man of me . Tryin ' to help me . Standing up to me and fightin ' me every day , tryin ' to teach me to be decent . Workin ' over me like I was a baby , or somethin ' , and you was tryin ' to teach me how to walk . Gettin ' me so upset that every time I do n't do what I ought to do , I get all het up inside ; I never was so damned uncomfortable in all my life . CROSBY And I never was so happy . BEN I s'pose God knew what he was about when he made women . CROSBY Of course he did . BEN Anyhow , he gave ' em the best of it , all right . CROSBY You do n't mean that ! You ca n't ! BEN I do . Let a man get miserable , and he is miserable . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I 'm having an easier time right now than you are . p. 81 BEN I know it . CROSBY They all hate me , and they all want something , all the time . I ca n't say yes , and it 's hard to always say no . Then there 's the farm , big , and poor , and all worked out . The Jordans have been taking their living out of this soil for more than a hundred years , and never putting anything back . BEN Just themselves , that 's all . CROSBY Worked right , like they do out West , this place could be what it ought to be . How can I do that ? It needs a man . BEN I been thinkin ' lately things could be done a whole lot different . CROSBY By a man , if he loved the old place  --  You Jordans robbed this soil always . Suppose one of you tried to pay it back  --  it would mean work and money , for a couple of years maybe , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done ; it ought to be . CROSBY By you , Ben ! BEN No  --  I guess I ai n't got the judgment . CROSBY You 've got it , if you 'd learn to use it . BEN Anyhow , I 've got just a month , that 's all . CROSBY Maybe you 'll have more . p. 82 BEN I 'm as good as convicted as I sit here . I 've only got a month . CROSBY Then help me for that month . We could plan how to start out in the spring . I 've got books that will help us , and I can get more . We could do a lot ! BEN I do n't know but what we could ! CROSBY bends toward him.Will you shake hands on it ? She offers her hand . BEN surprised.What for ? CROSBY Oh , just because we never have . BEN We ai n't goin ' to change everything , are we ? CROSBY One thing . We 're going to be friends . BEN takes her hand awkwardly.You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe . CROSBY And now for the surprise . BEN The what ! CROSBY draws her hand away and rises. You 'll see . I want you to sit right here , until I open those doors . She points to doors to dining room . BEN I was n't thinkin ' of movin ' . p. 83 CROSBY Just sit right there . BEN And do what ? CROSBY Think . BEN What of ? CROSBY Oh , anything  --  so long as it 's pleasant  --  of the spring that 's coming  --  BEN In the prison down at Thomaston . CROSBY Of France then , of the family that was so good to you  --  of the beautiful lady  --  of the daughter , if you want to , the one that was most grown up  --  and of the wonderful blue dress . Just shut your eyes and think , ' til I come back ! She exits through doors to dining room and closes the doors after her . BEN sits in glow from the fire , his eyes closed . In a moment the door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the light from the hall falling on her . She has on JANE 'S blue dress and is radiant with youth and excitement . NETTIE Ben ! Look at me ! Look , Ben ! BEN What ? NETTIE Look , Ben ! He looks at her and for a moment sits in stupid wonder , then rises slowly to his feet . BEN It 's  --  It 's Nettie ! p. 84 NETTIE Did you ever see anything so lovely did you ? BEN You 're  --  you 're a woman , Nettie ! NETTIE Of course I am , you stupid ! BEN crosses down to her.God ! How I 've starved for somethin ' pretty to look at ! God ! How I 've starved for it ! NETTIE That 's why I came down , I wanted you to see ! I waited there in the hall till she went out . BEN And you 've been here all the time , and I have n't so much as looked at you ! NETTIE softly.You 've been in trouble , Ben ! BEN I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight . I ai n't goin ' to let ' em take me now . NETTIE Honest , Ben ? BEN Not now . Oh , you pretty kid ! You pretty little thing ! He catches her fiercely in his arms . NETTIE You must n't , Ben ! BEN triumphant.Must n't ! You do n't know me ! NETTIE Just one then ! She holds up her lips , and as he kisses her ardently , the dining-room doors back of them open and JANE stands in the doorway , looking at them . She has removed her apron and has made some poor attempt at dressing up . Back of her we see the table bravely spread for the festive birthday party . There is a large turkey and other special dishes , and a round cake on which blaze twenty-three tiny candles . They turn their heads , startled , as JANE looks at them , and BEN tightens his arms defiantly about NETTIE . Let me go ! p. 85 BEN holding her and looking past her to JANE.No ! Then to JANE . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go . BEN to JANE.To hell with your dream of grubbing in the dirt . Now I know what I want , and I 'm going to get it . NETTIE Let go , dear . She draws away . I 'm ashamed about wearin ' your dress , Cousin Jane . I 'll take it right off . CROSBY You need n't . I guess I do n't want it any more . For the first time her eyes leave BEN 'S face . She turns and steps past them to the door at right and calls . Supper 's ready , Ella ! HANNAH enters at back in dining room with a plate of hot biscuits@@ SCENE . Same as Act One . Parlor at the Jordans ' , two months later . At rise the characters are grouped exactly as they were at the opening of the play . The white slip covers , however , have been removed from the chairs , and the backing through the window shows partly melted snowdrifts . HENRY sighs ; the clock strikes two . HENRY looks at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and BEN enters and looks about . BEN Well  --  here we all are again . FELLOWS sadly . Yes . HENRY I ai n't been in this room before since the funeral . FELLOWS And I ai n't , and the last time before that was when father died . EMMA I sat right here , in the same chair I 'm settin ' in now , but to your grandfather 's funeral , right after I married Henry , I was treated like one of the poor relations ! I had to stand up . HENRY I remember ; it made considerable trouble . ELLA I do n't know as it was ever what I called a cheerful room . HENRY severely . A parlor 's where a person 's supposed to sit and think of God , and you could n't expect it to be cheerful ! p. 87 ELLA looks about . Seems like we 'd had trouble and disgrace enough in this family without her takin ' all the slip covers off of the chairs and sofa ! EMMA It ai n't right ! FELLOWS That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street ai n't so much as goin ' , to have a parlor . I stopped her right on the street and asked her what she was plannin ' to do soon as the first of ' em died . EMMA What did she say ? FELLOWS Said she tried not to think about such things . HENRY sternly . We got Atheists enough in this town right now . BEN Well , if Jane 's coming I wish she 'd come ; this ai n't exactly my idea of pleasant company . ELLA She says we 're all to wait in here for Judge Bradford . FELLOWS What did she send for us for ? ELLA I do n't know . EMMA Why did n't you ask her ? ELLA I did , and she most bit my head off . BEN She most bites mine off every time I see her . I must say she 's changed , Jane has ; she ai n't the same girl at all she was a few weeks ago . p. 88 NETTIE She 's actin ' just awful , especially to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one to say anything against her , but  --  BEN But nothin ' ! There ai n't one of you here fit to tie her shoes ! FELLOWS We ai n't ? BEN And I ai n't ! The only difference between us is I ai n't worth much and I know it , and you ai n't worth nothin ' and you do n't . EMMA I guess you 'd better be careful how you talk ! NETTIE If anybody says anything about Jane lately , that 's the way he always talks ! The worse she treats him the better he seems to like it . FELLOWS Well , I do n't know as I 'm surprised more about his insultin ' the rest of us , but it 's sort of comical his talkin ' that way about you , Nettie . EMMA Nettie ! What 's Nettie got to do with him ? FELLOWS Oh ! Excuse me ! I did n't know ' t was supposed to be a secret . EMMA What is ? FELLOWS About the way those two have been carryin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! p. 89 NETTIE afraid . Stop her , Ben , ca n't you ? BEN If I knew a way to stop women like her I 'd patent it and get rich ! EMMA sternly . Him and Nettie ? FELLOWS They passed my house together once a week ago Wednesday , once the Tuesday before that , and twice the Sunday after New Year 's . HENRY Together ! FELLOWS And Eben Tilden 's boy told Abbie Palsey that Tilly Hickson heard Aaron Hamlin say he 'd seen ' em together at the picture show ! HENRY to BEN . Is it true ? EMMA You 've been with him after all I told you ! BEN It ai n't going to hurt her none just to talk to me , is it ? EMMA Them that touches pitch gets defiled ! HENRY to NETTIE . I want you to tell me everything that 's took place between you two . FELLOWS Wait ! HENRY What ? FELLOWS Orin ! Leave the room ! p. 90 NETTIE He do n't have to leave the room . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NETTIE Well  --  Ben and I  --  We  --  Just for a few days  --  anyway , it was all his fault . BEN She threw me down because I was going to prison . NETTIE He said he 'd get out of it somehow , but he ca n't , and I just wo n't have folks laughing at me ! BEN It 's all right , it never meant nothin ' to her , and I guess it did n't mean much to me . It 's just as well it 's over . NETTIE It 's a whole lot better . HENRY Well  --  what 's passed is passed . Folks that plant the wind reap the whirlwind ! There 's no use cryin ' over spilled milk . ORIN Say , Mum ! What do you s'pose Uncle Henry thinks he means when he says things ? HENRY Somehow I ca n't help wishin ' you was my son for just about five minutes . HANNAH and JUDGE BRADFORD enter HANNAH They 're all in here , Judge . JUDGE BRADFORD Good afternoon . HENRY How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mild day ; winter 's most over . Stop scratching yourself . This last to ORIN who seems to be uneasy and frequently scratches himself . HANNAH at door . I 'll tell her you 're here , Judge . She 'll be right down . HANNAH exits . ELLA Wo n't you sit ? JUDGE BRADFORD Thanks . He sits by table . HENRY What 's it about ? Why did she say we was to all be here at two o'clock ? JUDGE BRADFORD She will probably be able to answer that question herself , Ben . FELLOWS to ORIN . Do n't . ORIN What ? FELLOWS Scratch ! ORIN Oh . JANE enters . The JUDGE rises JUDGE BRADFORD Well , Jane ? CROSBY Do n't get up , Judge . JUDGE BRADFORD Will you sit here ? JUDGE turns to get a chair for JANE . ORIN scratches himself . ELLA rises. p. 92 ELLA What is the matter with this brat ? ORIN I itch ! FELLOWS It 's warm , and he 's got on his heavy flannels ! He 's as clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said to heat this room up and wait here for you and the Judge . Why ? I got my stock to tend . HENRY It 's a bad time for me to get away from the store ; what was it you wanted of us ? CROSBY I 'm afraid it is n't going to be easy to tell you . JUDGE BRADFORD Wo n't you let me do it , Jane ? CROSBY No . I 've come to know that your mother did n't really want that I should have the Jordan money . FELLOWS What 's that ? CROSBY I put it as simply as I could . BEN You mean a later will 's been found ? JUDGE BRADFORD No . CROSBY In a way , Judge , it 's like there had . Your mother left me a letter dated later than the will . ELLA Leavin ' the money different ? CROSBY Tellin ' what she really wanted . p. 93 BEN Well , what did she want ? CROSBY It was like she left me all her money in trust , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopin ' for come , and in a way it did come , not quite like she wanted it , but near enough so I can give up a burden I have n't strength enough to carry any more . She stops . JUDGE BRADFORD Let me finish , Jane . Jane has asked me to draw a deed of gift , making the Jordan property over to Ben . BEN Why ? CROSBY She wanted you to have it . BEN Why did n't she will it to me , then ? CROSBY She was afraid to trust you . BEN Well ? CROSBY You 've learned to work ; you 'll keep on working . HENRY You mean to say my mother wanted him to have it all ? CROSBY Yes . HENRY I am a religious man , but there was a time when even Job gave up ! So  --  all our money goes to Ben  --  and he ca n't even buy himself out of prison ! CROSBY after a pause . Ben is n't going to prison . p. 94 BEN Why ? Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JANE . Kimbal agreed not to press the charge against you . It seems that there were certain extenuating circumstances . A motion has been made for the dismissal of the indictment , and it wo n't be opposed . BEN Why did he ? Who fixed this thing ? CROSBY Judge Bradford did . She looks at JUDGE . BEN slowly . It means a lot to me . There 's things I 'd like to do . I have n't dared to think about ' em lately  --  now I 'll do ' em . There is a pause . HENRY Well , Ben , so you 've got the money ! I guess maybe it 's better than her havin ' it ; after all blood 's thicker than water ! We 'll help you any way we can and  --  er  --  of course you 'll help us . BEN Why will I ? HENRY We 're brothers , Ben ! We 're old Jordans ! BEN What was we when I got back from France ? There was a band met us boys at the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only somehow , in just a little while you forgot about it . I was a Jordan when I was hidin ' out from the police , and all that kept me from starvin ' was the money Jane sent me ! I was your brother the night mother died , and you said you would n't go my bail . p. 95 ELLA You ai n't going to be hard , Ben ! BEN I 'm the head of the family now , ai n't I , and you can bet all you 've got I 'm going to be a real Jordan . HENRY I think , Ben  --  BEN From now on , there ai n't nobody got any right to think in this house but just me ! So run along home , the whole pack of you , and after this , when you feel like you must come here  --  come separate . ELLA Turn us out , Ben ? BEN Sure , why not ? NETTIE crosses to him . Sweetly . There ai n't any reason why we ca n't be friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's only one way I could ever get to trust you . NETTIE What way , Ben ? BEN I 'd have to go to jail for five years and see if you 'd wait for me ! EMMA It 's an awful thing for a mother to have a fool for a child . ELLA goes upstage with NETTIE . Well , I must say you made a nice mess of things ! NETTIE exits with ELLA . Well , I do n't care ! I do n't see how anybody would expect me to be a mind reader ! p. 96 FELLOWS Come , Orin  --  say good-by to your Uncle Ben . ORIN What will I do that for ? FELLOWS Because I tell you to ! ORIN Yesterday you told me he was n't worth speakin ' to ! FELLOWS Are you going to move , you stupid little idiot ? She drags him out . ORIN as they go . What did I say ? You let me alone ! HENRY I was wonderin ' , Ben , how you 'd feel about endorsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I do n't know what I 'm going to do about it . BEN As far as I care , you can go nail it on a door . HENRY and EMMA start to exit . No , hold on , I 'll pay it . HENRY You will ! BEN Yes , I do n't know as it would do me much good at the bank , havin ' a brother of mine in the poorhouse . BEN laughs as HENRY and EMMA exit . JUDGE BRADFORD Well , Ben ? " Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown . " BEN down to stove . Depends on the head . Mine 's thick , I guess . Anyhow , none of them is going to bother it . I 'm boss here now . p. 97 JUDGE BRADFORD You 'll find a copy here of the inventory of the estate , and other legal papers . Everything is in order . CROSBY And my accounts , Ben ; you 'll find the exact amount your mother left . I spent some money about six weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since and I 've made up for it . BEN You said , Judge , she did n't have to go by that letter of my mother 's , if she did n't want to ? She did n't have to give anything back at all ? JUDGE BRADFORD No , she did n't . BEN Then if I was you  --  To JANE . I would n't talk so much about the little you spent on yourself . I guess to look at you it was n't much . CROSBY Yes , it was . BEN Well , we 'll fix things so you can keep on spendin ' . Only let 's see somethin ' come of it . I never was so damned sick of anything in my life as I am of that old black dress of yours ! Crosses stage up and over right . CROSBY I 've got plenty of clothes upstairs . I 'm sorry now I ever bought them , but I 'll take them with me when I go . BEN Go ? Go where ? CROSBY To Old Town . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill . p. 98 BEN You ! CROSBY Yes . BEN But what about me ? JUDGE BRADFORD Do n't you think Jane has done about enough for you ? BEN She 's done a lot , she 's given up the money . I do n't know as I like that ; ' course I like gettin ' it , but not if she 's going away . CROSBY I could n't stay now , and I would n't want to . BEN I do n't suppose you remember about plannin ' what you and me was to do with this old farm ? CROSBY I remember . BEN Well  --  then what are you going away for ? CROSBY Because I could n't be happy here , Ben  --  It 's been harder than anything I ever thought could come to anybody , the last few weeks here  --  and so I 'm going . She turns to JUDGE . I 'll go upstairs and get my things . I 'll stop at your office , Judge , on the way to the station . JUDGE BRADFORD Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before I order my new farm machinery or anything ? You 're goin ' to leave me with all this work on my hands ? CROSBY Yes , Ben . She exits . p. 99 BEN Well  --  that 's a lesson to me ! Oh , she 's a good woman ! I ai n't denyin ' that  --  but she 's fickle ! JUDGE BRADFORD You 're a fool , Ben ! BEN I been doin ' kitchen police around this town for quite a spell now , Judge , but from this day on I ai n't goin ' to take that sort of talk from anybody . JUDGE BRADFORD I assure you that you wo n't have to take any sort of talk at all from me . He starts for the door . BEN I did n't mean that . I do n't want you to think I ai n't grateful for all you 've done for me . JUDGE BRADFORD coldly . I have done nothing for you . BEN If it was n't for you , I 'd want to die ; that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , just a coward about it . Now I 'm a free man , with a big life openin' ' out ahead of me  --  I got everything in the world right here in my two hands , everything  --  and I owe it to you ! JUDGE BRADFORD I am very glad to say that you do n't owe me anything . I do n't like you , I have n't forgiven you for what you did to your mother 's life . Nor for a worse thing , one you have n't brains enough to even know you 've done . Do n't be grateful to me , Ben , please . I think nothing could distress me more than that . p. 100 BEN You 've been a good friend to me . JUDGE BRADFORD I have n't meant to be ; as I said , I do n't like you . I have n't any faith in you . I do n't believe in this new life of yours . You made a mess of the old one , and I think you will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get away from me . I 'll be grateful till I die . But for you I 'd have gone to that damned prison ! JUDGE BRADFORD But for Jane . BEN How Jane ? JUDGE BRADFORD How Jane ? Jane went your bond the day your mother died . Jane took you in and taught you how to work , made you work , taught you through the one decent spot in you something of a thing you 'd never known , self-respect . Worked over you , petted you , coaxed you  --  held you up  --  Then you hurt her  --  but she kept on  --  She went herself to Kimbal , after he had refused me , and got his help to keep you out of prison  --  then , against my will , against the best that I could do to stop her , she turns over all this to you  --  and goes out with nothing  --  and you ask " How Jane ? " BEN Why ? Why has she done this , all this , for me ? The JUDGE looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left in deep thought . JANE comes downstairs dressed for a journey with a handbag , etc . She enters p. 101 CROSBY Good-by , Ben . She crosses to him , her hand out . Good-by . Wo n't you say good-by ? BEN First , there 's some things I got to know about . CROSBY smiles . I guess there 's not much left for us to say , Ben . BEN she crosses to door , but he gets ahead of her . There 's things I got to know . She looks at him but does not speak . The Judge tells me ' t was you got Kimbal to let me go free . He looks at her  --  she half turns away . Answer me . Pause . The Judge tells me you gave up what was yours  --  to me  --  without no other reason than because you wanted me to have it . That 's true , ai n't it ? Pause . You sent me every cent you had , when you knew mother was dying , then you went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all them other things . I do n't know as any woman ever did any more  --  . I want to know why ! CROSBY Why do you think ? BEN I do n't know  --  I sort of thought  --  sort of hoped  --  CROSBY bravely . It was because I loved her , Ben  --  p. 102 BEN Oh . He turns away disappointed . CROSBY You 're forgetting , I guess , how long we was alone here  --  when you was in France  --  then the months we did n't know where you was , when the police was looking for you  --  She used to make me promise if ever I could I 'd help you . BEN Well  --  all I 've got to say is you 're no liar . CROSBY Good-by . She turns . CROSBY No . I wo n't do that . I 've done enough ; you 're free , you 've got the money and the farm . BEN crosses in front of table and sits left of table . They ai n't worth a damn with you gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they ai n't . CROSBY It 's sort of sudden , the way you found that out . BEN Oh , it do n't take long for a man to get hungry  --  it only takes just a minute for a man to die ; you can burn down a barn quick enough , or do a murder ; it 's just living and getting old that takes a lot of time  --  Ca n't you stay here , Jane ? p. 103 CROSBY There 's Nettie . BEN Nettie  --  that could n't stand the gaff  --  that run out on me when I was in trouble . CROSBY It does n't matter what folks do , if you love ' em enough . BEN What do you know about it ? I suppose you 've been in love a lot of times ? CROSBY No . BEN Then you be quiet and let an expert talk . I was lonesome and I wanted a woman ; she was pretty and I wanted to kiss her  --  that ai n't what I call love . CROSBY You . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEN That do n't worry me none  --  I guess the feller that wrote the dictionary was a whole lot older'n I am before he got down to the L 's . CROSBY You 've got good in you , Ben , deep down , if you 'd only try . BEN turns . I know , it 's always been that way ! You 've never tried for long ; you 've never had a real ambition . BEN When I was a kid I wanted to spit farther than anybody . CROSBY Good-by . She starts up to door . BEN And so you 're going to break your word ? JANE turns , hurt. p. 104 BEN I do n't know what ' t was you promised mother , but you 've broke your word . No man ever needed a woman more'n I need you , and you 're leaving me . CROSBY That is n't fair . BEN It 's true , ai n't it ; truth ai n't always fair  --  You ai n't helped me none , you 've hurt me  --  worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CROSBY It do n't seem like I could stand to have you talk like that . BEN What you done you done for her . I did n't count , I never have , not with you . CROSBY When you 've been trying to do a thing as long as I have , it gets to be a part of you . BEN You done it all for her  --  well  --  she 's dead  --  you 'd better go . CROSBY Maybe I had , but if I do it will be with the truth between us . Here 's the letter she left for me , Ben  --  I got a feeling somehow like she was here with us now , like she wanted you to read it . She holds it out . It 's like she was guiding us from the grave  --  Read it . Crosses up to window . BEN reads . " My dear Jane : The doctor tells me I have n't long to live and so I am doing this , the meanest thing I think I 've ever done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since my husband died there has been just one person I could get to care about , that 's Ben , who was my baby so long after all the others had forgotten how to love me . He mumbles the letter to himself , then brings out the words . Hold out her heart and let him trample on it , as he has on mine . " Slowly he breaks down , sobbing bitterly p. 105 CROSBY Do n't , Ben  --  BEN Look what I done to her . Look what I done . CROSBY hand on his shoulder . Oh , my dear  --  my dear ! BEN I did love her , more'n she thought , more'n I ever knew how to tell her ! CROSBY kneels beside him . It was n't all your fault  --  you were a lonely boy  --  she never said much  --  she was like you , Ben , ashamed to show the best that 's in you . BEN bitterly . The best in me . I ai n't fit that you should touch me , Jane  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ben , and I think you do . BEN I love you  --  more'n I ever thought I could  --  tenderer  --  truer  --  but I 'm no good  --  You could n't trust me  --  I could n't trust myself . CROSBY Spring 's coming , Ben , everywhere , to you and me , if you would only try . BEN Can a feller change  --  just ' cause he wants to ? CROSBY I do n't want you changed . I want you what you are , the best of you  --  just a man that loves me  --  if you do love me , Ben . p. 106 BEN Ca n't you help me to be fit ? CROSBY I 'm going to do the thing I always meant to do  --  good times and bad , Ben , I 'm going to share with you . BEN God knows I  --  CROSBY Hush , Ben  --  I do n't want another promise . BEN What do you want ? CROSBY You said I was a good sport once  --  You shook hands on what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plenty to be done . I 'll stay and help you if you want me . BEN A good sport ? He takes her hand . I 'll say you 're all of that . HANNAH enters HANNAH If you ai n't careful you 'll miss that train . CROSBY That 's just what I want to do . HANNAH You ai n't going ? CROSBY I 'm never going , Hannah . HANNAH You going to marry him ? BEN You bet your life she is ! HANNAH I guess you 'll be mighty happy  --  marriage changes folks  --  and any change in him will be a big improvement . She picks up JANE 'S bag and exits  --  JANE and BEN laugh.
