txt The most adventurous and dangerous trip ever taken by members of the staff of the Museum of Natural History was described yesterday by James L. Clark , Assistant Director , of the museum , who , - with William J. Morden , leader of the expedition , found : the home of the ovis poll : in ; Turkestan ; traversed a part of Mongolia.and Was ' captured and tortured . by he wished they would - shoot ! him - to put him out of his misery . ' ' - He escaped death ' probably because of the interference of Russian officials , who , he said , are now worried by the unruly aspect of this savage people fl whom they have armed and inflamed . The burden of Mr. Clark 's story was , " Take a chance . " He and Mr. Morden took chances because there was nothing else to do if they were to accomplish their mission . The peril of storms in the black passes between India and Turkestan , the horror of heat on the alkali plains and the uncertainty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their trip . Mr. Clark admitted yesterday that he was glad the trip is now in the realm of reminiscence . Obtained Museum Specimens . The expedition went after large animals of the Russian Pamirs , which is usually forbidden territory ; the TianShan Mountains , and of Central Asia , such as the ovis poli , roe deer , ibex , gazelle and others needed to complete the museum 's collections . Despite the mishaps vs ; : dch befell Mr. Morden and Mr. Clark , it was completely successful . The first adventure was into the jealously guarded Pamirs , where Russian Turkestan abuts on Chinese and British territory , and three nations watch each other across the borders . Outsiders are not welcome in the Pamirs ; those who go there are suspected of looking for oil or gold or of wishing to start a railroad . Hunting for pleasure is inconceivable and a museum means nothing . " Do n't go over , " the natives told Mr. Harden and Mr. Clark when they approached the border . " They will strip you and turn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked it over and decided to take a chance , " said Clark yesterday . They started over the Burzil Pass . between great peaks 16,000 feet high , a month before the pass was officially open . There were storms ahead of them and storms behind them , blinding whirlwinds of snow that beat in their faces and hid the trail as fast as it could be made . ? - Burned by Sun Amid Snow . " But we had to travel early in the morning , at the first hint ' of light , " said Mr. Clark , " for In those passes the heat of the sun is terrific , and when it reaches its height it melts the snow and softens it so that anything will start an avalanche . A footfall , a rolling stone , the vibration of a voice . between those great walls of snow-clad rock will bring down a mountain of snow . " The sun was so hot that frequently when my feet were frostbitten it , would burn the exposed parts of my face . Three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . " Once in the . Pamirs they were treated well by the Russian officers on post there . They found herds of ovis poll , and discovered , as Mr. Morden had suspected , that it was the breeding place for them and was one of the spots through which Marco Polo , for whom the sheep are named , wandered on his trip to the east . They saw 225 rams in a morning . From the Pamirs they went on to the Tian-Shan Mountains , where there are 7,000 glaciers . From there they went over the Muzat Pass , 11,000 feet high , over a glacier , to a fertile area , well watered and covered with spruce trees and grass . It is known as the Tekes Valley  --  and is unique in that arid region . Get News of Andrews 's Plight . There they heard that.Roy Chapman Andrews , whom they had intended to meet in the interior of Mongolia , could not get through because of the war in China . They did not want to go south because the passes might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cided to go 5 ; 500 miles to Urga and take an automobile from there to Pekin , a journey , of only four days . They went through the great Turfan depression , the deepest place on the earth 's surface not filled with water , a place where the dried alkali Is broken up in cakes like ice in a jam , and on to - Urumchi , the capital of Chinese . Turkestan . Then came the problem of crossing Mongolia . Every one they asked told them that it would be safe , although they learned later that nobody in that part of the world knows what Is a day 's journey away from him . They sent back their specimens , and with only one servant went on to Kutchengtze , where they obtained a camel train . On Noy. 1 , last year , they entered Mongolia . Captured by Mongol Raiders . " We had gone about 100 miles , " said Mr. Clark , " when , one night at dusk , we were surrounded by armed men . They took us to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our baggage , touching our boxes and our rifles . They had Russian caps and the star of the Russian soldier . " When we reached a round tent the Mongols took us. inside . We left our rifles and all our equipment outside . There in the dusk was a little fire , with men sitting around it , silently , smoking short pipes with tiny bowls . " They paid no attention to us. and although that is the native way , they were more aloof than usual , it seemed to us . They just looked at us now and then and said nothing . " We asked for the officer in charge and there was no response . I took out a folding lamp and put a candle in it , so that I could show them my passport . It meant nothing to them ; they had never heard of America . They threw it aside . Then we used a letter in Russian to the Russian Consul , because we had heard the ' Moneols were controlled by the Russians , but they threw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weapons Taken by Captors . " We learned later that they had taken our guns and revolvers and bags off our saddles and also stripped our camel train . Finally they began to whisper , and that looked bad . One man would come in and whisper and then go out , and another would come in and whisper and go out . " I . said , ' we 're in wrong . ' " I'started to get up and go out and a man shouted to me . Bill said he thought that meant he wanted us to stay , so we stood there . Then one of the men put his hand on our servant 's face and pushed him over backward , contemptuously . Then we set down again . We did n't want to force trouble . " Things , began to happen quickly then . Men shouted and others came in with ropes and got behind me . I thought they were going to strangle me with the rope , so I kept my eye on them as much as possible , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of them tool , me by the shoulders and threw me down , and two others did the same to Bill . Then they sat on us and tied the rope around our wrists , pulling ' it as tight as two men could pull it . It cut into the flesh and hurt a good deal . " When we were on our feet a big man looked over at ' me and for some reason took a - swing at me with his hand . I do n't know whether he was ' aiming at my pipe , which was still in my mouth , or my head . I ducked and he knocked the bowl of the pipe right off the stem . Showers of sparks went flying through the air . The stern stayed in my mouth and he knocked that out . Water Tightens Wrist Cords . " They looked bad then . Their eyes were glary , like the eyes of men excited by cruelty . One of them took a pan of boiling water from the fire , and Bill yelled , ' They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see at first - what they were doing , and I'could n't have helped him anyway , but after a while I saw they were pouring - the water on the rope around our wrists to make it tighter . That was to be - the torture , apparently , for the rope was as . tight as the men could make it . " After that they . went through our pockets and emptied- them of everything . I supposed they were doing it because it would be easier to do It while . we were alive than when we were dead . We could n't possibly get away . If we got outside we ? would freeze to death , as it was way below zero . The only reason we could see for tying us was that they might finally kill us . " Our servant had been talking to one of the men and I asked him what he had heard .. He said they were going to kill us . That was no news ; it sounded reasonable . Our hands got cold and , we put them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men pushed Bill over . Our hands were swollen then . They felt like balls of fire , and there were pains up our arms . " We wondered how long it would take to find out what had become of us and how the news would leak out . We were glad we had insurance , and each promised that if by any chance he came through and the other did n't he would look after the other man 's wife . We were n't afraid any more ; we did n't care what happened , except that we hoped they would shoot us and make it snappy instead of torturing us to death . Our arms hurt so then that even being shot would have been a relief . Tried Fainting to Escape Pain . " I tried to , faint and so did Bill , so we would n't feel the pain . I would keep quiet and so would he , and then I would say , ' Bill , are you out yet ? ' And he would say , No , how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say . After a while men came in with guns and Bill said , ' Well , we are going to ' get it now . ' " They took us out and tied us back to back to a pole in another and smaller tent . We were placed sitting down , our elbows fastened together , and ropes , from ? our elbows to our knees . That did n't matter ; a little ' more did n't make any difference . " They put ray cap on my head and it fell down over my eyes so .1 could n't see , and . that did make it worse . There was no fire in this tent , but we did n't feel the cold because of the pain . We were so nervous we were sweating . " After a while they came in and felt ' our hands . We thought they must be frozen , and we wondered what we I would do if we got out without our hands . I said I would n't go home to my wife and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't thought that far ahead . I do n't know how long that night was , but they finally took the ropes off and we got back a spark of hope . " Then they brought us tea , and we got more hopeful that we were n't to be tortured to death . It was amazing how quickly our hands got back to normal . In an hour they were almost all right , although some of the nerves are broken , and I still get little electrical shocks in them where the nerves are smashed . Cried on Regaining Caravan . " They had more long conferences about us , and refused to , let us go forward or back . the way we had come . They told us we would have to go as we were , without equipment , a distance of 250 miles over the mountains , with the temperature sometimes 40 below zero , accompanying a party of soldiers . I knew we could n't stand that , and finally they agreed to let us have our caravan and go on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our caravan , which meant life to us . I was so unnerved from the reaction to suspense and torture that I cried . " That was the end of their suffering . They were released in Kobdo through the intervention of a Russian , and made their way to the Transsiberian Railroad and Peking , where they arrived on Jan. 1 . They had been in the interior of Asia nine months and had traveled thousands of miles . The expedition brought back , in addition to the specimens for the Asiatic Hall of the museum , more than 18,000 feet of moving picture film and 4,000 still photographs .
