In Holland to deliver lectures on " War and Revolution , " Count Czernin , statesman of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire , said : " As long as America and other nations , such as Germany and Russia , stay out of the League of Nations , that body means nothing at all . Without America the League has no future . First and foremost , America must become a member of the League , and , secondly , Germany and Russia . As it now stands it is not a league at all , but merely a trust of victorious states . " Czernin was Foreign Minister during the last phase of the Habsburg rule over the Austro-Hungarian Empire - 1916- 1918 . He is considered by the " big men " of Central Europe the brains of post-war Austria . It was largely owing to his initiative that trade agreements with Czechoslovakia were negotiated whereby Vienna will retain her industrial supremacy . Before the war the factories of Vienna were dependent largely upon raw materials from the region now under the sovereignty of the Czechs and the Slovaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Germain , Austria was left with machinery , but with practically no coal or raw materials ; Czecho-Slovakia received the raw materials , but had hardly any factories with which to manufacture them . Czernin 's perspicacity was , therefore , of great mutual benefit . Although an ardent royalist , supporting a party which favors a return to the old empire , he is working independently at the moment to facilitate the reconstruction of Austria .
