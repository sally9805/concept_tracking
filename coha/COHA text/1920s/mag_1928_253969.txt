Last week newspapers paid a debt to crime . It is one of their greatest news assets but seldom do editors have a chance to say nice things about men who have committed crimes . <P> The subject , and beneficiary , of last week 's articles was one Joseph ( " Jake " ) Pensendorfer . The press " discovered " him at the head of a woodworking factory near Camden , N. J. He and his 15 employes are all ex-convicts . <P> At the turn of the century , in Philadelphia , Joseph Pensendorfer was sentenced to hang for the murder of his father-in-law who had attacked his wife . Two days before his death day , the sentence was commuted to " life . " Nine months ago he was pardoned and released from Pennsylvania 's Eastern Penitentiary , after an exemplary term during which he had made himself a master carver and inlay worker . He had patented tricks of his own in woodworking and had a $50,000 bank credit ( royalties ) awaiting him . <P> Free , he went home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled its walls with windows . " Some of us have not seen much sunshine , " he said . Then he took in men he had known -a pardoned murderer , an embezzler , a forger-and let them work on at the trade they had learned in prison , rigging ship models , turning radio cabinets , joining chairs . <P> " During my time , " said Mr. Pensendorfer , whose business already flourishes , " I saw that the released convict had no chance in the world . I saw them come in , serve their term and go out with the determination to go straight . <P> " Then I saw them come back-licked . They had tried but their prison records and the cops were too much for them . . . " <P> In the Pensendorfer factory at West Berlin , N. J. , the workmen need have no names . They have only three rules to obey : keep straight , shun booze , work hard . Ex-convicts skilled at woodworking are welcome at West Berlin .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
