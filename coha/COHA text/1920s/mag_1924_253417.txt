Not long ago , Secretary of State for the Colonies , J. H. Thomas , announced himself as an Imperialist when he said that the Government intended to do everything in its power to develop the Colonies and aid the Dominions to develop themselves . This streak of Imperialism , which once called forth scorn from Labor , was again manifested when the Government announced that it had no intention of surrendering the Sudan to Egypt ( TIME , July 7 ) . <P> The Sudan , apart from its strategical importance to Anglo-Indian communications , is abundantly watered by the tributaries of the River Nile . Its great plains are , by a combination of this fact and their geographical position , eminently suited to the raising of cotton . This caused that veteran Socialist-publicist , Sidney Webb , and his wife to become parties to the Government 's Imperialist designs . <P> Mr. Webb , President of the Board of Trade and Member of the British Cabinet , recently affirmed the Government 's intention not to quit the Sudan . To a Manchester audience , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that region and fired the imagination of his audience by referring to " COTTON : SUDANESE WHITE GOLD . " He said that the Government was making great efforts to increase the cotton production of the Commonwealth , not only in the Sudan but in other British-African possessions and in India . He said that a Nation could prosper by the " smell of the market " and to make the odor appetizing he announced that he was setting up an inquiry " into conditions of industry , particularly with reference to the industries working for the export trade . " <P> It must be noted that in Europe each nation is striving to develop itself as far as possible by increasing its supply of raw materials , with a view to becoming economically self-sufficient . The nations following this policy most vigorously are France and Britain . <P> ... <P> Sidney Webb , a picturesque little man with a big beard , once a civil servant , was , with Bernard Shaw and Graham Wallace , one of the leading lights in the Fabian Society-organization of Socialism which has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound economic lines , and is responsible in no little part for the moderation displayed by British Socialists today . The members of this Society founded the celebrated London School of Economics , which is now one of the most important centres of economic teaching in the world . <P> Beatrice Potter was also an authority on Socialist economics before she married Sidney Webb in 1892 . It is said that she married for her husband 's ideas , but there seems to be no doubt that she is the cleverer of the two . She also had some money . <P> These two people were soon to become famous , chiefly for their exhaustive book , The History of Trade Unionism , which has been well received by all shades of political thought as an authoritative work . Their most recent book , The Decay of Capitalist Civilisation , did indeed meet with severe criticism and is unquestionably faulty-although a highly illuminative book . Again , they are probably the greatest authorities on municipal affairs in Britain and certainly the greatest Socialist-economists of their time . It is said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can quote from memory the export and import figures for any commodity in any given year .
