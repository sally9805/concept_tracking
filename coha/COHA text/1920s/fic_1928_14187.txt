IN a little ravine or sort of valley close by the college town is part of a larger Negro settlement called Johnson 's Gully . Of late years the more respecting inhabitants have restyled the place Johnstown . Here the laborers , many of whom have come from different parts of the state and from neighboring states for the building of the greater Institution , herd together , sleeping and eating as best they can . In the evenings you will find them laughing , singing , and sitting before the shacks with their girls , or walking out if the weather is fine towards the hilly fields that lie west of the town . Swarms of kinky-headed children shoot marbles or roll battered automobile tires along the crooked roads called streets . At times they stop and look on in awe as BELLE 'S sweetheart from Raleigh comes cadillacking along in his flashy wire-wheeled Ford . And the " sport " calls to a girl sitting in the yard with a man . She rises and goes with him . Her companion left alone growls wrathfully to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ride like that some day , goddam he will . But he wo n't , for the crapshooters know his soul . On the porch of old QUIVIENE LOCKLEY 'S shack across the street sits EDDIE UZZELL , a man past fifty now , with his head bent despondently in his hand . BAD ED he had been called in the old Memphis days . Bootleg liquor , women and cards have caved him in . He looks out towards the west where the sun is setting behind the smokestacks of the cotton-mill and hums a song to himself about BRADY the rounder who broke the hearts of the women in Gawgy . He too was like that once . And remembering the gal in Winston-Salem and the three kids which once were his , he hits the side of his chair and spits softly in the yard . After such a life , swinging a pick in a ditch for two bucks a day and all the manhood gone out of you is a hell of a way to end . And then too them white men stand around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big-bugs come down from Durham and Raleigh and the Lord knows where , rolling around in their Packards and Franklins and Studebakers . They walk about with the president and point with their canes . O God A'mighty . Spitting again , he gets up , takes a step or two and then reseats himself with his head in his hand . The sun goes down , other boarders come out of the house and join him on the porch . They light their pipes and cigarettes , they talk a bit now and then . The little valley fills with dusk , and darkness rolls up to cover them . Now and then a spurt of a match lights up a face , and the coal of a smoker intermittently glows and subsides , like a dull firefly . Silence comes over the sort of town , voices up and down the streets grow softer , come less often . The boarders on OLD QUIVIENE 'S porch sit in long stretches of motionless silence . Each grows busy with his thoughts of tomorrow and yesterday , each withdrawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one by one , " see you all tomorrow , " and mosey off to their bug-ridden beds in different parts of the valley . Ignorant and blind , valiant of the Lord ! Then a soft voice tinkles in the darkness . SEENY GRAY , the bold-eyed dishwasher in a cafeteria uptown , asks if MILLY has been heard from lately . OLD QUIVIENE spits a stream of snuff before her and answers , " Nun-unh . " And her thoughts like those of the others on the porch go back to a night last winter when things went wrong . Nothing particular happened , but still things went wrong . It happens that way sometimes , they all had said . In our words , matters get tangled up , explosions occur like thunder and lightning in a storm and then quiet comes again as after a rain . Still the twisted and torn can not be straightened and eased when the quiet does come . " Poor MILLY . Poor TOM STERLING . poor everybody . " AUNT QUIVIENE said . Weather or not , things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain it is that the cold huddles these poor ones together indoors , and sickness makes the days and nights more difficult to bear . And at times things other than sickness break out among them as if an invisible and malignant devil were sicking them on to blood and murder . Ask him afterwards why it happened and he will reply , " I du n no , suh I went blind , crazy-mad all of a suddent . " " He called me a son of a bitch and no man kin do that and live . My mother was " Nobody except the orthodox knows why , but still at times all goes wrong . It happened so one cold night last January there in OLD QUIVIENE 'S place  --  at least the beginning of it . It is about seven o'clock in the evening and OLD QUIVIENE is setting the supper for her boarders on a long rakish table in the rear of the room . She brings the dishes from a sort of lean-to a step lower at the back where a stove can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large tin heater almost red-hot with a roaring fire is near the right wall , a cot near it , a door opening out , and farther to the left of the room a wide ragged bed . At the foot of the bed and nearer the front a low door leads into another room . The men come in from the lean-to shed and sit down by the stove where two others are sitting . They snuggle down in their chairs humped over , warming themselves by the stove and saying nothing . The weariness of the day 's labor is upon them and the warmth of the fire makes them drowsy . Presently there is a knock at the door to the right . LEVIN FARROW raises his head up alertly . LEVIN is always alert . He is quick on the call and lives as if always expecting something or somebody . FARROW Come in . JOHN HENRY , a heavy stolid man with a bluish soot-black crafty face , comes in . He wears a derby , a yellow overcoat and gloves , and carries a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , everybody . The men around the stove raise their heads , stare at him a moment , and then return to their rest . Only FARROW remains watching him  --  and that attentively . FARROW How you come on ? HENRY Tell me youg'n git meals here . FARROW Ax her in there . QUIVIENE Coming in . Good evening , suh . HENRY Git meals here ? QUIVIENE Make yourself at home . HENRY Can I git supper ? QUIVIENE Wo n't be a speck of trouble . HENRY Taking off his overcoat showily and folding it carefully on his suitcase by the wall . How much ? QUIVIENE We wo n't fall out over that , Mister  --  HENRY Never mind the name , grub taste the same . He lays his derby on his overcoat , slowly takes off his gloves , and sits down near the stove . QUIVIENE waits a moment and then returns to the kitchen . FARROW Smiling friendly . Cold out . HENRY turns sleekly about and stares at him patronisingly , saying never a word . FARROW raises the lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes suh , cold and a snow maybe . p. 4 QUIVIENE Calling from the shed . Willie , git me some stovewood . WILLIE , a slender Negro of about thirty with a childish face and cloudy eyes , stretches his hand vainly towards the warmth of the stove , grins mulishly at the men , hesitates and then goes out . FARROW Jollily . Hep , some husband ! HENRY Brain 's dead on him . FARROW How come , stranger ? HENRY Just is . FARROW Sho ' . Smart whah you come from , ai n't they ? HENRY Smart and sharp . FARROW How sharp ? HENRY Coldly . So sharp they got p'ints on their fists like a needle . Stick ' em right through a man , git ' em wrong . FARROW Uh-uh .

Pass everything on de road but a filling station . BAD-EYE fingers his jewsharp and looks piteously at FARROW . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece with your harp . BAD-EYE turns his face upwards and begins plucking and humming . FARROW pulls his plug hat out of his pocket and passes it around , taking up imaginary pennies . Presently he tires of it and sits down with all the fun gone from his face. p. 6 FARROW Supper ' bout ready , Aunt Quivie ? QUIVIENE Be ready time the rest ' rives . WILLIE comes in and sits meekly by the stove . FARROW His fun turned to bitterness . Git yo ' mammy her wood ? WILLIE Ai n't my mammy . FARROW What is she ? WILLIE snickers and blinks at FARROW . Weaned you yit ? WILLIE bursts into squeals of laughter . Damn ! the old cow 's been dry forty year . He bends his head between his hands and is silent , his face hardened with spitefulness . Now and then he stares brightly at UZZELL whose head is bowed on his breast . SMITH Dem fish smell lak de new life . WILLIE Fish and oysters . FARROW Suddenly warm again and smiling . Fish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What for ? He sees HENRY smiling patronizingly at him . Oh , sho ' . HENRY Softly . Sho ' ? p. 7 FARROW Mysteriously . Ne ' mind . HENRY Brutally . Such a fool .

SEENY GRAY , a young bold-eyed girl of twenty , is seen entering the shed at the rear .

BAD-EYE sleeps away , WILLIE looks on with open mouth , now and then wiping his dripping chin with his sleeve . UZZELL 'S face again seems live and full of interest. p. 12 FARROW Cracking out the words in the open air . Heighp , Lord-a-mercy ! Listen that fool talk and say nothing . HENRY A rasp in his voice .

Oh yes , sho ' . Grunting . He prophesies . HENRY starts to reply and then fastens his eyes on SEENY GRAY who comes tripping in . GRAY With a round , resonant voice . How you-all come on ?

' Fore God he said you and me 'd have trouble  --  trouble between us maybe to-night . SEENY giggles and looks at HENRY with luminous , inviting eyes . Silently HENRY turns and walks abstractedly up and down the room . In a moment TOM STERLING comes in and stands by the stove warming himself . He is a tall , broad-shouldered young fellow , twenty-eight or thirty , with a square jaw and wide-set direct eyes . He reaches out playfully and scuffs BAD-EYE 'S wool around . STERLING How you come on , old 97 ? SMITH Awright . Looking up at him with humble admiration . She ai n't come yit. p. 15 STERLING Oh yes  --  working late again .

Throwing the cup against the floor and breaking it to pieces . And that 's the end of my say . He pulls a coin out of his pocket and goes over to OLD QUIVIENE . Bad luck not to break the cup , and here 's a quarter for it . QUIVIENE Lord-a ' - mercy , keep it back from me ! He puts the coin on the table and sits down silent by the stove . SMITH I 'm gwine to dat garage ! He grabs his hat and dashes out of the house at the right . QUIVIENE Willie , go build a fire in Milly 's room . WILLIE looks fearfully at the darkness in the shed , hesitates a moment and goes out . Presently he is heard cutting wood on the wood-pile . FARROW Well , Seeny  --  I was about to forget , Zeb .

Rubbing his hands and slapping his thighs in anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Charlie Chaplin . Funnier ' n you , John Henry , I say , funnier ' n you , John Henry . HENRY makes no reply but sits bent over the stove . And a white momma what scorches the screen . UZZELL , now gloomy once more , goes to the wood-box , replenishes the fire and sits down again with his head in his hands . FARROW calls with sly softness. p. 34 FARROW When I get about sixty-five dollars , Take my hammer to de captain , &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell him I 'm gone , boys , &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell him I 'm gone . He takes SEENY by the hand and starts towards the rear . I say , John Henry , I mean John Henry . But JOHN HENRY is silent as before . SEENY jerks her hand from FARROW , goes to the stove and warms herself . GRAY Blandly . Too cold outside to be going anywhere . HENRY chuckles softly to himself . FARROW Here 's your coat .

HENRY Putting his arm around SEENY and drawing a knife out of his pocket , his face brutal and malevolent . Eigh , by God do n't you bother him . MILLY Take Sonny in there and be putting him to bed . She pushes him towards the door and he goes in . Then she takes the other child in after him .

He throws the new coat at ZEB , grabs him by the hand and bursts out of the house . HENRY drops his knife back in his pocket , clutches SEENY to him and turns up and down the room with her in his arms . She giggles in a sort of terrified joy . GRAY Whispering . Ai n't never no man been like you before . UZZELL sits up and looks at them with sceptical condescension , and OLD QUIVIENE , throwing out her hands in despair , begins clearing away the table. p. 36 HENRY His face buried on SEENY 's shoulder . Can you do the hot-box from Georgia ? GRAY Anything , anything . Trying to disengage herself . But later , later . Whispering . I ca n't breathe . WILLIE comes timidly in with an armful of wood , looks at them in amazement , then tip-toes into the room at the left . SEENY breaks loose from HENRY and flies to help OLD QUIVIENE . HENRY emits a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two and then sits down again at the stove , looking heavily at his watch . UZZELL Hoarsely . What time by your squash ? HENRY Bed-time for working men that needs sleep . I do n't need it . UZZELL Do n't work ? HENRY Engineer at night , a brakeman in the day , Tell the women in the townsI 'm on-a my way . WILLIE comes in and sits down . QUIVIENE Come dry the dishes , Willie ! He sighs forlornly and goes out . STERLING and MILLY are heard talking in low tones as they put the children to bed . SEENY comes in from the rear for the last pile of dishes . UZZELL goes quickly over to her , his sombre face filled with a hungry look. p. 37 UZZELL Hand me a drink of water . With one hand he takes the dipper , with the other catches SEENY 'S outstretched palm . GRAY Softly as she looks at HENRY 'S bowed back . Ed , Bad Ed you used to be . UZZELL With a wretched sigh . Seeny girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Ed . UZZELL Glancing carefully behind him and looking at her hungrily . Do n't do it . I 've travelled the road . I know . GRAY With quiet hardness . Old crows and young birds , Ed . You 've said so , you know . UZZELL His writhing smile playing about his lips . All right Whispering sadly . I like you . SEENY goes out with the dishes . UZZELL returns the dipper to the bucket and stands thinking , his hands shoved deep into his pockets . He speaks softly to himself and then to HENRY . Dig a new foundation for the old . Eigh , brother ? But HENRY bakes himself by the stove and says nothing . UZZELL gathers up the fragments of the broken cup and lays them on the table . SEENY comes to the door with a dish-cloth in her hand. p. 38 GRAY Aunt Quivie 's all upset , Ed . UZZELL Let Zeb go on . With a glance out of his shaggy eyes . The old crow , the young bird . Jocularly . Eigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Gov'nor 'll be back in the morning . Shrugging his shoulders and pulling his coat-collar around his neck . See you at breakfast . If I do n't , worry ' bout me . He whistles softly and goes out through the shed . In a moment he pokes his head back through the shed door . Oh Seeny GRAY Yeh . UZZELL Tra-la-la , girlie ! He closes the door and is heard whistling again as he goes away . QUIVIENE In a sharp , rasping voice . Quit slubbering them dishes . Muttering .

QUIVIENE Looks like plenty others need training around here , sho ' God do if my eyes got any sight in ' em . The door at the right opens and BANTAM WILSON comes cautiously in . On seeing him , HENRY closes the door to the shed. p. 39 BANTAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY Shaking hands with him and hugging him around the shoulders . Early . Did n't expect you till tomorrow night . Crow , little rooster . BANTAM Come on a th'ough train . Glancing around the room . Whah 's everbody ? Sho ' a hell of a dump . He is an ebony black little negro , squat , agile and ape-like , with slender legs and powerful shoulders . His massive hands hang down below his knees . HENRY All the better though . We can shove off towards Washington on the midnight from Durham . BANTAM Mebbe so and mebbe not . Winking at HENRY . Mought wanta spend a little sleeping wid my ' oman . Soberly .

And dey laugh , and deir laugh sound cool , but dey stand way off . Ax Henry , he know .  --  Fiercely . And all de time , my ' oman heah mommicking up wid him . Even in his fierceness there is the suggestion of pleasantry. p. 46 HENRY Coolly . A little something , not much . In MILLY 'S room a child whines and there is a noise of a window being raised . BANTAM darts across the room . BANTAM Ho , little birdie , do n't fly away . He opens the door and catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . MILLY Tom , Tom ! STERLING I kill that Wilson . HENRY Stepping before him . For God 's sake , stay out'n that room . He 's got a gun on him . BANTAM As a struggle is heard . Dere , dere , honey . Gi ' us a kiss . With a loud smack . Dat 's it , several of ' em . A whole armful . STERLING Git out o ' my way . HENRY As the women whimper and plead with TOM . For God 's sake  --  But he gets no further , for STERLING hits him a blow in the face , laying him flat on the floor . GRAY Flying at him . Stop it , Tom . Do n't do that . Something terrible  --  p. 47 HENRY Standing up , a knife in his hand . No man hits me like that and live . He moves towards STERLING . MILLY is heard moaning , as BANTAM coos over her . BANTAM Momma , momma , pritty baby ! GRAY Turning from STERLING and throwing her arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , le 's go . HENRY Trying to pull her arms from around him . I 'll kill de goddamn snake , I 'll kill him . GRAY Kissing him and drawing him towards the rear . Come on , come , I 'll go with you . Whispering , her face against him . You know , you know , anything , anything . HENRY waits a moment and then , pulling her to him goes quickly out through the shed . OLD QUIVIENE sits down with a gasp and lays her head on the table . WILLIE turns foolishly about , sees SEENY 'S coat hanging on the wall , gets it and goes into the shed . WILLIE Whimpering . You done forgot your coat . STERLING starts cautiously across the room to the left , when the door opens and BANTAM stands forth , hugging MILLY to him with one hand and carrying his pistol in the other. p. 48 BANTAM Put ' em up . WILLIE comes in at the rear , carrying the coat . He stops , terrified . MILLY Gasping . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll kill you . BANTAM I tell you to stick dem hands up in de air . QUIVIENE Flinging herself before TOM and beating on his breast . Git out'n the house . For God 's sake , git away , and do n't bring trouble on us . BANTAM I gi ' you one minute , den trot . He waits . STERLING stares at him blankly . MILLY Oh Lord . BANTAM Here goes den . He fires twice in close succession . MILLY screams and OLD QUIVIENE falls in a chair , rocking and moaning in grief . WILLIE looks on with eyes astart and then with a shriek flees through the door at the right . MILLY tries to claw at BANTAM 'S face , but with one arm he holds her suffocatingly against him . Do n't git wild , honey , I ai n't killed him . Des ' brushing his britches to let him know I means business . STERLING looks dully at MILLY for a long while and then , turning without a word goes slowly out at the rear . BANTAM lowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good-bye fohever . Turning and drawing MILLY into the room , his huge hands spread fanlike on her breast . Honey babe , you 's a soft bunch o ' flowers . Nunh , sweet ! He closes the door behind him. p. 49 QUIVIENE Crawling up and making her way to the door at the right . Willie , come back honey ! Ai n't nothing to hurt you now ! She turns around and goes heavily to the bed . Sitting down , she rocks her head back and forth in her hands . Presently she pulls off her shoes , drops her skirt , turns down the cover and wraps herself up . WILLIE comes cautionsly in . WILLIE Whah is he ? QUIVIENE Her shoulders jerking with suppressed sobs . Blow out the light and get to bed , son . He blows out the light , takes off his shoes and trousers and lies down on the cot at the right . The room is dark save for the dim light that comes from the grate of the stove . The shadows on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broken by MILLY 'S low sobs , comes into the room . The bed is heard creaking as the ex-convict goes to his long-awaited rest . MILLY 's sobs gradually die away to low moans , and presently BANTAM is heard snickering , even giggling . MILLY 'S moans now take on a different tone . QUIVIENE Sitting up in bed and snickering also . Hear that , Willie ? WILLIE Whimpering . I skeered over heah . Sees dat man wid de pistol . p. 50 QUIVIENE Come and git into bed with me , honey . With alacrity he runs and jumps into the bed . She hugs him up close to her and he pulls the covers down tight over his head . The faint outlines on the walls disappear . The peace of darkness , night within and without , enfolds the house and its troubled souls . The door at the rear springs open and BAD-EYE comes trampling in . SMITH Whah is you , folkses ? Half sobbing . Dat man fooled me ! QUIVIENE Who 's you ? SMITH Mournfully . De old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SMITH Plucking his jew 's harp in the darkness . Whah dat man ? QUIVIENE He gone out .

Gon na say my prayers . QUIVIENE Yeh , honey , do . In the dim light he is seen crouching by the bed. p. 51 WILLIE Mumbling . Our Favver who art QUIVIENE Joining in fervently . Thy Kingdom come , thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven . BANTAM Inside . Somebody at dat window . He is heard getting out of the bed . QUIVIENE AND WILLIE Fohgive us our trespasses as we fohgive those who trespass against us . MILLY Within . Ai n't nobody , Bantam . Come back to bed . BANTAM Uhp , dere he is ! I kill de goddam snake . The report of his pistol is heard , followed by the crash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with WILLIE . QUIVIENE Moaning aloud . Lord have mercy on us , Lord have mercy . BANTAM Cracking the door and peering out . Shet up your screeching . Jest teachin ' him to stay from my window . QUIVIENE Standing up and wringing her hands . Go ' way from here ! Go ' way from here ! BANTAM Ai n't gon na be no trouble . De p'lice come , you ai n't heerd nothing , ai n't been no shooting . Somebody in de hollow killing cats . Angrily . Git in yo ' bed . He closes the door and is heard returning to his bed again cooing to MILLY . Sweety babe , sugar lump . p. 52 WILLIE Springing into bed and wrapping himself up . Come hyuh stay wid me . QUIVIENE Yeah yeah , honey . She goes to him and they both lie wrapped in each other 's embrace under the quilts . She croons over him and quiets him like a child . WILLIE De p'lice , will dey bodder me ? QUIVIENE They wo n't bother you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . QUIVIENE I wo n't , honey . Rest yourself . WILLIE Dat man wid de pistol ! QUIVIENE HE done gone . Sleep , sleep . Willie whimpers and jerks beneath the covers . We ai n't heard nothing , ai n't seen a thing , been asleep , all the time been asleep . And soon quiet comes over them and they are asleep . The light goes out of the stove , the shadows are gone from the wall , and all is darkness within and around . Somewhere under the stars TOM STERLING is abroad eating his heart out with grief . He will return at dawn . Ah , BANTAM , pillow your head well ! In the bright glare of day some months later six striped convicts are digging on a blazing road , swinging their picks aloft and bringing them down . Four others come behind piling out the dirt with shovels . The white dust hides the blackberries in the hedge , and the willow clumps are bent under its weight . The heat of July shimmers across the land as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiendish dance . The sweat pours down , the only dampness in the world for the ten mourners on the road . On a stump to the left a guard squats , drowsy , vapid , like a toad . The rifle in the crook of his arm keeps alert , as watchful as LEVIN FARROW , its muzzle warns like an eye , it threatens . Fall , picks , and heave arms ! On the bankside to the right another guard sits . He also is sleepy , drowsy . His rifle also keeps alert and watches , its muzzle threatens . The convicts dig with their backs to the guards , their faces set down the infinite stretch of road that disappears in a point on the horizon . Like so many soulless puppets , they lift their hands towards the sky and bring them down , never any slower , never any faster . And as the picks come down against the earth with a thud , a husky desperate groan bursts from their baked lips . As rhythmic as the beating of their hearts the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over long maddening hours of pain until the sun sinks cooling in the west and the guard stirs and says , " Call it a day . " At times their voices are raised in a chant , level , patient , as eternal and tough as the earth in which they dig . Sometimes they talk as they work , but not so often , for the staccato of conversation breaks up the rhythmic routine of labor and that 's what they 're there for  --  labor , labor , working on the roads . Ninety days on the roads TOM STERLING and sixty days for you , BANTAM WILSON . The judge dropped his tobacco by his foot , rose and gave sentence . Disturbance of the peace . Assault with intent to kill . These niggers , these everlasting niggers , always fighting , always shooting . They 've got no sense , they 'll never have no sense . Give ' em the law , let ' em feel it . Obedience , peace , peace . This is the republic , these are the institooshuns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Dig , dig . Side by side they dig  --  BANTAM WILSON and TOM STERLING . Misery has made them friends , sorrow companions . BANTAM 'S spirit still walks unbroken , STERLING 'S has gone under . The feel of iron and abuse of tongues have broken him . His great shoulders are bent , his legs hardly sustain his weight , and his arms fling up the pick and let it fall hour after hour , day after day , with slowly decreasing power . And all the while his lightless face stares at the earth beneath . These are the children  --  hanh . These are the brethren . The guard on the right stirs in his sleepiness and beats at the flies with his hat . p. 53 FIRST GUARD Rain or shine the old dog-flies stay with you . SECOND GUARD Lighting a cigarette and passing the package on to the first . And the damn musketeers allus drilling for water . FIRST GUARD Heigh you , Sterling , raise up that pick and let ' er come down . The convicts dig on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " saying never a word . You hear me ? I say put some pep in that digging . BANTAM After a moment  --  without looking round . He 's sick , ai n't able to work . SECOND GUARD You bastard monkey runt , who 's talking ? FIRST GUARD Hell 'll be frozen ' fore you git this little digging done . They lapse into silence again . The second GUARD stretches his arms in a yawn . SECOND GUARD Lord , I 'm sleepy  --  sleepy . FIRST GUARD Better leave her off a few nights . The convicts with the shovels burst into a snicker . SECOND GUARD Brutally , his voice sharp with hate . Somebody begging for the little rawhide . The four convicts , terrified , push their shovels deeper into the loose earth and pile it out. p. 54 FIRST GUARD I want some water . SECOND GUARD The goddamed water boy 's fell in and drownded . Standing up and calling . Water boy ! Water-jack ! Could a-been there and half way back ! The diggers begin a low working chant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it calls . " Water , water , give us some water . Where is it ? Where is he ? Where is the Great I Am , the Almighty God . Listen now , while us gi ' you de call . Eigh Lawd , come wid de ' sponse ! " CONVICTS I called my people  --  hanh , I said my people  --  hanh , I mean my people  --  hanh , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eigh , Lawd ! FIRST GUARD That 's right , sing him out'n the bushes . SECOND GUARD If it ai n't water it 's grub , ai n't that it 's something else . Bear down on them picks ! Jesus Christ ! ( STERLING suddenly tumbles over and falls with his face flat in the dirt . A convulsive shudder seems to run through the other convicts , but they carry on their digging , never any slower , never any faster . CONVICTS I called my friends  --  hanh , I said my friends  --  hanh , I mean my friends  --  hanh , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heigh now , none o ' that , none o ' that ! BANTAM His voice rising in a whine . He sick , bad sick ! FIRST GUARD Better got cured ' fore he come here . Marching up to the prostrate body . Get that mouth out'n the dirt . Whirling towards BANTAM . Nobody asked for your jowing . Eyeing him . Want the little cat-tails ? BANTAM Slinging his pick . Jesus , Jesus ! FIRST GUARD Snap out'n it , Sterling . SECOND GUARD Getting a leather thong from his coat . Put a firecoal on his tail and rise him . FIRST GUARD Gon na step to it , Sterling ? But STERLING makes no answer . He 's a stall boy . Hell , he 's stalling ! SECOND GUARD Damn right he 's stalling . FIRST GUARD This ai n't no party . SECOND GUARD Hell it ai n't no party ! He smoothes the thong with his hand and looks at the first guard. p. 56 FIRST GUARD Make ' em work , make ' em work  --  that 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're here for  --  work ! FIRST GUARD Work  --  work  --  let him taste it . SECOND GUARD Raising the strap above his head . Thirty-nine , thirty-nine . His voice coming out stronger now , more sharply . The law , the law ! But still he holds the leather poised without bringing it down . A low murmur of horror rises among the convicts , growing into their chant , full of hate now , full of begging , but hopeless withal . CONVICTS I called my sister  --  hanh , I said my sister  --  hanh , I mean my sister  --  hanh , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eigh , Lawd ! FIRST GUARD Hold her a minute , we 'll see , we 'll see . He goes up to STERLING and pokes him gently in the ribs with the muzzle of his rifle , but only the twitching back makes answer . SECOND GUARD Try him in the collar . He cuffs him gently in the collar , then with more insistence , at last with vehement roughness . A low whine is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bending down . Goddamn it , we 'll see ! SECOND GUARD And what song is he singing now ? FIRST GUARD Do n't say nothing . Moans and whines . He do n't say nothing . SECOND GUARD By God , we 'll see . Oh yes , he 'll talk . He 'll tell us a mouthful ! The convict working chant grows fuller , the rhythm begins to shape the picks , to hold the rising and falling arms to their labor . The cry for help , for peace , grows stronger  --  and with it the baffled will , the confused soul sends forth its cry . CONVICTS I called my brother  --  hanh , I said my brother  --  hanh , I mean my brother  --  hanh , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eigh , Lawd ! FIRST GUARD Let him have it . The Second Guard hands his rifle to the first and then looking around the world as if for a witness of justification , begins to beat the prostrate figure . Again a shudder and the gust of a groan sweep the convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never any faster , never any slower . CONVICTS I called my mother  --  hanh , I said my mother ,  --  hanh  --  p. 58 SECOND GUARD Six  --  seven  --  eight  --  nine  --  ten . FIRST GUARD And now you 'll work  --  and I reckon you 'll work . SECOND GUARD Eleven  --  twelve  --  thirteen  --  fourteen . And the watchers in the skies cry blood , blood  --  earth , earth , sweet earth receive it . Keep it , save it till the next harvest . FIRST GUARD Oh yes , he 'll work , and I reckon he 'll work . The WATER BOY bursts through the hedge at the left , stands teror-stricken a moment , and then dropping his bucket with a clatter tears down the road . The precious water sinks into the dried earth . Now they chant in hopelessness , and the four with shovels wag their heads , their parching tongues protrude through baked lips . Ah , hope is no more  --  life is no more  --  death  --  death all around us . Grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep us . SECOND GUARD Fifteen  --  sixteen  --  seventeen  --  eighteen . Now TOM STERLING has reached the end . In a last burst of life he staggers to his feet , his eyes glazed with madness . FIRST GUARD Go to work . Look out  --  The SECOND GUARD turns to grab his rifle but STERLING is upon him . He strikes him in the face and beats him to the earth , crushing the stems of the early goldenrod by the ditch and tearing the clumps of knotted lady-thumb. p. 59 STERLING His voice coming out in a great animal scream . Hah  --  hah  --  hah . He beats the GUARD 'S upturned face with his fists . SECOND GUARD Kill him ! Kill him ! The convicts sing on , now their chant rises louder , fresher . Revenge ! Revenge ! Hope is not perished from us . Our arms are still strong . CONVICTS I called my father  --  hanh , I said my father  --  hanh , I mean my father  --  hanh , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eigh , Lawd ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUARD stands stupefied . Then as if suddenly awakening he steps back , raises his rifle and shoots STERLING through the back . He rolls over and lies with face upturned in the burning sun . The SECOND GUARD crawls over to the bank and lies stretched out in the grass , his body heaving and jerking with angry , strident sobs . The FIRST GUARD stands looking foolishly down at the dead Negro . The four convicts drop their shovels and hover together in a shuddering group , the six sing on , beaten  --  darkness , night  --  God sits high in heaven , his face from the Negro , his hand towards the white man . The poor and needy cry in vain , the iron palings hold them. p. 60 FIRST GUARD The goddamned fool , he 's dead , dead ! SECOND GUARD Sitting up with a high laugh as he wipes the blood from his face . Had to kill him , we had to kill ! Peering forward . Dead as a fly . Moaning . They 's something wrong , something wrong here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sons of bitches ! And the body lies still . Once it knew swiftness , legs that ran by the cabin , played in the cornfield . Eyes that knew starlight , knew moonlight , tongue that knew singing . As they say in the song , and I lay this body down . In the cool hedge the fly says " zoom . " And a buzzard wheels by the flat disc of the sun . And they dig and they sing . O earth , give us answer ! Jesus hear us !
