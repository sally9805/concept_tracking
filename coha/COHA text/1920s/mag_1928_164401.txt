There was a new judge . There was a new jury . There was a certain amount of new evidence . But it was the same old case-the U. S. v. Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair for alleged conspiracy to defraud . <P> The same old Teapot Dome hung upon legal pothooks . The same old stories were expected from the defense : how , in 1921 , the Navy Department wanted oil storage tanks in case of War ; how , in 1922 , Oilman Sinclair took the Teapot Dome lease for " patriotic " as well as private reasons ; how he invested in Liberty Bonds for like reasons , and gave wads of these bonds to Albert Bacon Fall , the Secretary of the Interior who leased him Teapot Dome , not as a gift but to buy an interest in Fall 's ranch in New Mexico . There was the same Fall son-in-law , Rancher Mahlon T. Everhart , to testify how this ranch transaction was made . <P> The chief differences between this trial and Oilman Sinclair 's last one were : 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2 ) that Son-in-law Everhart was now obliged to talk , a Federal law having been changed for his benefit ; and 3 ) that the jury was locked up , as the result of Oilman Sinclair having had his last jury , which was left at large , followed about by private detectives . <P> The Judge . The judge before whom Oilman Sinclair last started to be tried in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia , was Justice Frederick Lincoln Siddons of the famed theatrical family of that name ( TIME , Nov. 14 ) . Justice Siddons lost much prestige through having to declare a mistrial that might not have occurred had he locked up the jury . The new judge , Justice Jennings Bailey , set out to conduct a different sort of trial by examining the talesmen himself , and curtly overruling many an elaborate objection by Sinclair 's lawyers . Moreover , he announced that court would convene at the unheard of hour of 9 a. m. , and served notice on the Sinclair lawyers that special pleading would not be permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like boys at a spelling-bee , the new jury gazed with undisguised wonder at chunky Oilman Sinclair , whose broad face expressed confident determination . " Any time the truth comes out it is bound to help , " was still Sinclair 's attitude , but he was pale now as well as jaunty . <P> The jurors also gazed at the Mesdames Sinclair , the defendant 's wife and mother . They seldom miss a day at his trial . The wife entered court the first day of this trial wearing orchids . <P> They were simple folk , the jurors , but all of them were able and accustomed to read newspapers . Justice Bailey saw to it this time that they were no collection of citizens so dormant that they had no knowledge of the Oil Scandals . He excused only those talesmen who said they had formed a firm opinion as to Sinclair 's guilt or innocence . The twelve that were sworn were three grocers , a steamfitter , a repair man , an auto salesman , two clerks , a merchant , an expressman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them knew it , all these men had been investigated and watched by Sinclair detectives before being sworn as his jury . While they were being picked , Sinclair , surrounded by his lawyers , ticked off their names on the sleuths ' report and scrutinized their faces .
