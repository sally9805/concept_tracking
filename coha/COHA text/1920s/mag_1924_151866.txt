There are two fields of public endeavor in which women have equalled or eclipsed men . One of these is the formation of clubs . The other is public reform . In the field of reform , it will be years before the name of Carrie Nation is forgotten . With a fame not so flamboyant as Carrie Nation 's , but equally enduring , the name of Lucy Page Gaston will survive . Miss Gaston passed away last week . <P> At Delaware , Ohio , in 1860 , Miss Gaston first came into the world . At an early age she evinced a desire for improving it . In 1899 , she founded and became Superintendent of the Anti-Cigarette League of America . She joined heartily in the reform work of the W. C. T. U. She prosecuted cigarette dealers whenever the law enabled her to . She agitated for anti-cigarette laws and ordinances . She edited reform papers . <P> In 1919 , after a rumored disagreement within the Anti-Cigarette League of America , Miss Gaston resigned and announced that she was a candidate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and fearless law enforcement . " She retired from the campaign , however , before the election . <P> About the same time Miss Gaston undertook to write to Queen Mary , reproving her , if press reports had been corect , for enjoying a cigarette after luncheon . She declared that it would be " exceedingly unfortunate " if English standards were lowered by a Queen 's example . Miss Gaston aided in the campaign which put a law against cigarette smoking on the statute books of Kansas . She also entered another organization , the National Anti-Cigarette League , but departed when the Board of Directors decided that her methods were too " drastic . " <P> Some months ago she was injured in a street car accident ; since then her health has failed . She died last week in Chicago , and press dispatches ascribed her demise to a " malignant growth in her throat " - surely not a cancer derived from too much smoking . <P> Her funeral services were held at the First Presbyterian Church and were attended by a few friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who arose , pointed to the coffin , recited : " Miss Gaston , we thank you for what you have done for us , " and followed this by repeating the " Clean Life Pledge , " which Miss Gaston had taught . <P> Afterward Miss Gaston 's body was taken to a cemetery and cremated , according to her wishes .
