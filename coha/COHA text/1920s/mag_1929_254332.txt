Some years back , when George Leon Loft , son of George W. Loft , famed " penny-a-pound-profit " candyman , was a member of the New York Stock Exchange , he appeared on the trading floor in a smart new spring suit . Knowing his reputation for being ready to buy or sell anything , friends of Mr. Loft surrounded him and began to auction off the suit . When the price reached $100 , George said " sold . " Into a telephone booth he stepped , removed the suit , tossed it out to the purchaser , remained in seclusion until another suit was brought from his home . <P> Last week this same Mr. Loft was busily engaged in trying to keep , not a suit , but a job . He is president of Loft , Inc. , candy chain which for more than 50 years has been a Loft property . Now a group of stockholders is attempting to oust the Loft family ( Mr. Loft Sr. is cruising in the Mediterranean ) and elect as two of the eleven directors Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , and Mr. Edward T. Williams , vice president of Page &; Shaw . At a stockholders ' meeting last week ( reminiscent of the late Rockefeller-Stewart and Childs-Barber controversies ) the Page &; Shaw interests rounded up an apparent majority of the company 's stock . But President Loft challenged so many of the Page &; Shaw proxies that the meeting was adjourned with no decisive action .
