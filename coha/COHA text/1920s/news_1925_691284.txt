txt With " Nervousness and Its Cure " the subject of his sermon at the Jewish Science service yesterday morning at the Hotel Majestic , Rabbi Morris Lichtenstein held up President Coolidge for emulation as a follower of the simple life . " President Coolidge is setting an example of quietness and lack of ostentation which the citizens of the country would do well to follow , " he said . " Amid the turbulence or public life he has kept his inner quietude and simplicity ; he has shielded his family , too , partidularly his offspring , from the hectic and deteriorating effects of spotlight publicity . In other words , in his personal life he has made no attempt to ' keep up . ' " I use the words ' keep up ' In a derogatory sense , for it is the mad desire to ' keep up ' with everything and with every one that has made our generation signally neurotic and restless . Day by day new Interests , new problems are crowding in upon us . We rush at each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . It is sufficient that our neighbors have taken up their pursuit . We must ' keep up ' too . " We throw ourselves into the whirlpool because others are there .

" But there is no reason why life should be such a worrisome thing . Life can just as well be beautiful and serene and purposeful . It is necessary , however , to first change our outlook upon life , to cease pursuing that which brings us only strain and worry . Our fundamental needs are much less than we think them to be our actual wants involve no strain , no worry , no fear . A return to a simple mode of living will bring with it calmness and serenity .

Ribourg , rector of St. Andrew 's Protestant Episcopal Church , said in part : The law of sacrifice makes nations great . A selfish nation is to all intents and purposes a dead nation . Self-sacrifice is a national necessity as well as a Christian virtue . No amount of wealth or power can save from decay a nation which lives only unto itself . " DECRIES THOUGHTLESSNESS Father to Many Present-Day Ills , Says Dr. John E. Heindel . " Thoughtlessness is father to many of our present-day ills , " said the Rev. Dr. John E. Heindel In his sermon . yesterday at the English Lutheran Church of the Redeemer , Jersey City . " God has given to normal man the ability to think , " the minister declared . " Man often does not make use of that ability . This is especially true of the crowd . Its brain is carried in its feet . It is surprising how far crowds will go and what they will do when their thoughts come from their feet . Miles shorten into human steps until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
