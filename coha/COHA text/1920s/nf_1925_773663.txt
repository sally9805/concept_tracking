txt WHY WE BEHAVE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS Of less power of resistance . To some bacteria we are naturally immune ; to others we are naturally susceptible . The problem is to acquire immunity . How can we get exemption from disease ? By having smallpox we acquire immunity from smallpox ; also by vaccination . Against typhoid , from plague and Asiatic cholera , we acquire immunity by vaccination with dead bacteria ? " cultures . " With a secretion ( or excretion ) of living bacteria we acquire immunity from diphtheria . In other words , we become actively immune by incorporating into our body " live virulent bacteria , less virulent bacteria , dead bacteria , bacterial secretions , or bacterial products from broken-down dead bacteria . " An anti-bacterial serum is a protective ; an antitoxic serum is a curative . Much is known of the " how " of immunity , almost nothing of the " why . " But great advance in the future will come from specific artificial remedies ? drugs , chemotherapy . The problem is to find a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " magic bullets charmed to fly straight to a specific objet ? tive , turning aside from anything else in its path . " Quinine is specific death for malaria germs ; ipecacuanha for the ameba which causes amebic dysentery . Possibly chaulmoogra oil is a specific cure for leprosy ; asphenamin ( " 606 " ) , for syphilis , relapsing fever , and yaws ; atoxyl , for sleeping sickness . The list of specific cures is pitiably small ; yet . Bacteriology is new , immunology is newer . Only re . cently have the chemotherapists had real targets to shoot at . The problems which confront them to-day are vastly mo important than the puny worlds Alexander exhausted in his conquests. // THE ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND THE CAUSES OF DEATH 1 WHILE life remains in the body , the duct glands furnish the necessary chemicals for heat and energy metabolism and for the preparation of materials for growth and repair . If they fail to supply fuel , the body dies ; if they fail to furnish wilding material , the body stops growing . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then appears that the body hich began as a fertilized ovum develops into a 9-pound infant in 9 months . Why does it not develop into a 90-pound child in 90 months , or a 900-pound prodigy in 900 months ? Even if it only kept up its first two years ' rate-growth , it would weigh 500 pounds in twenty-four years . It does not grow so big . It stops . Sometimes too soon ? it is dwarfed ; sometimes not soon enough ? it is gigantic , though rarely , if ever , surpassing the nine feet three inches of Machnow , the Russian . But it stops . Why ? Meanwhile the growing body keeps changing in size , shape , roportions . Certain parts or organs appear before others art to appear . For a while the brain grows faster than the // motor mechanism ; at other times the motor mechanism grows more rapidly . The teeth have their special periods for growth . The infant 's thigh bone at birth has 2,000,000 bone-building cells . When that bone is a finished adult product it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few ? How do the leg bones know when to stop growing longer , the skull bones to stop growing larger ? Why does the body grow by fits and starts and finally seem to be complete ? What regulates the growth of all these parts and of the body as a whole ? Moore replaced a rat 's ovaries with the sex glands fro a male ; her body and behavior took on decided male chary ters . By the same operation which converts the unruly bu into a docile ox and the stringy cock into a tender-flesh capon , the Sistine Chapel in Rome up to 1878 maintained i male sopranos . Why does the boy 's voice begin to era and his face , almost overnight as it were , begin to grow beard where there was no sign of one ? Is sex also , like grow and individuality , a whim of " heredity , " or are our sex , i dividual traits , and physical growth under the control definite regulators ? Fifty years from now we shall begin know the details , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretions to open up not only a new chap ' of life , but new accounts with life . They regulate sex , ra of growth of tissues and organs , and consequently physic traits . The secretions of the ductless glands are discharged dir into the blood , hence they are also called glands of inter secretion , or endocrines ( endon , within ; krino , I separat There are commonly said to be seven endocrines proper : roid , parathyroid , and thymus , in the neck ; pituitary pineal , in the center of the head ; adrenals and spleen , in abdomen . But it is not yet proved that the thymus , pin and spleen are true glands . The liver , pancreas , and glands also function as endocrines . Endocrine secretions are chemical in nature and are // a l l y called hormones ( exciters ) . They are also called autavoid substances : from acos , a remedy ? they act like drugs . They are drugs , some of them of astounding potency . In fact , no man-made drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug-store glands . Mere regulation is not , of course , confined to the secretions of glands . For example , the chief regulator of the respiratory system is carbon dioxide , given off by every cell of our lady ; thus liberated , it functions as a hormone or " exciter . " But , as Abel puts it , the hormones actually known are definite and specifically acting indispensable chemical products which edify development and growth of other organs , especially wring embryonic life , and the entire metabolism , including at of the nervous system , during adult life . Then , too , ere is a collective operation of the endocrines , as yet not definitely known , but summarized by Barker as follows : More and more we are forced to realize that the general form and the external appearance of the human body depends to a large extent upon their functioning . Our stature , the kinds of ( ices we have , the length of our arms and legs , the shape of the Avis , the color and consistency of our integument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount and distribution of it on our bodies , the tonicity of our muscles , the sound of the nice and the size of the larynx , the emotions to which our " exterieur " gives expression ? all are to a certain extent conditioned the productivity of our hormonopoietic glands . We are , in a se , the beneficiaries and the victims of the chemical correlations our endocrine organs . In short , as the discovery of enzymes and antibodies gave dew insight into the problem of the nature of living process , the discovery of the hormones opens up anew the whole conception of heredity . We can now say that men are alike use they inherit the same kind of blood and similar sets glands to secrete hormones for the blood to carry ; but that soon differ because they do not meet the same physical and chemcial conditions during life and as a consequence do not // develop the same catalyzers , the same immunity agents , or the same regulating agents . Or we can say , with Loeb , that the organism itself molds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human ovum , into a human being , because the genus Homo and species sapiens inhere in the specific protein of the human ovum ; but that the traits of individuality or " Mendelian characters " are determined by the enzymes regulating metabolism and the hormones in control of growth and so of personality . 2 The endocrine gland best understood is the thyroid ( shieldlike ) astride our Adam 's apple . It varies individually and with age . It is relatively largest in fetal life . At birth its weight in proportion to the entire body is as 1 to 300 , by the third week as 1 to 1,160 , and in the adult as 1 to 1,800 . It is generally larger in women than in men . Why this is so is not yet known . The thyroid usually consists of two equally developed lobes two inches long , an inch and a quarter broad . They vary greatly ; one lobe may be much larger than the other , or may be quite absent . Generally the two lobes are connected by an isthmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may be accessory thyroids down the trachea as far as the heart . Only in higher fishes does the thyroid become a ductless gland , take on new functions , and start a new career . In man , a duct is sometimes found in the isthmus ? vestige of a condition found in lowest fishes , echo of millions of years ago . It is prone to trouble . Frogs ' eggs develop into fish-like tadpoles . Tadpoles 1 their tails and gills , develop true lungs , and become fro Remove the tadpole 's thyroid : it never becomes a frog ; remains a tadpole for life . Feed a tadpole with thyroid : it becomes frog in a hurry , the fish stage of its existence being // reduced from a year to two weeks ; but the frog is only as big as a fly . Feeding thyroid to tadpoles evidently produces two results : it hastens metamorphosis but retards growth . Children with deficient thyroids , through removal , atrophy , or injury , become heavy-featured , gibbering , idiotic dwarfs known as cretins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin is dry and hairless ; their sex glands are under-developed ; their pubic hair and puberty develop late or not at all ; their temperature is subnormal ; they are potbellied because their pelvis remains small , their limbs short and thick . The corresponding adult condition is known as in myxedema : white , hairless , and thick , dry , rough skin ; obesity ; lowered temperature and metabolism ; pulse slow and weak ; mind dull . These appalling results in both children and adults have been corrected by feeding thyroid extract . The changes thus produced have been little short of miraculous . Cretins have increased in stature several inches in one year . The first myxedema patient to be treated died in 1920 after twenty ! line years of good health due to thyroid feeding . Enlargement of the thyroid from whatsoever cause is called oiler , or Derbyshire neck . But an over-developed or overlive thyroid produces a definite disease known as toxic or exopthalmic goiter , or Graves ' disease . This is characterized by increased metabolism and blood pressure , rapid pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeballs  --  hencee the name , " exopthalmic . " The remedy is still in the ads of the surgeon . The cause and significance of change the thyroid in toxic goiter and the cause of endemic goiter not yet understood . Nor is it understood why women are re prone to toxic goiter than men , the disproportion in e localities being as high as fifteen to one . It is believed that the activating principle of the thyroid ' none is thyroxin , isolated by Kendall in 1918 . Thyroxin a crystalline compound of three molecules of iodine fixed // in a protein derivative : **28;36;TOOLONG propionic acid , or 65 per cent of iodine . Only the thyroid secretes thyroxin , and apparently it is the iodine in thyroxin that tells the story . Iodine is found in many seaweeds ; is three times more abundant in codfish than in human beings ; is found in traces in milk and in drinking water ; and gets its name from its violet ( iodes ) color ! Possibly no life exists without iodine . Certainly normal human life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Three and a half grains of thyroxin a all that stands between intelligence and imbecility . B there are , of course , dozens of causes of subnormal mentali other than hypothyroidism . No limit of function can yet be assigned to any one e docrine , because they are parts of an organic whole and fun tion as parts of living individuals . So with the thyroid much is known , its whole story is far from known . But ' from what is known Hoskins characterizes it as a regulator of energy discharge to aid in adapting the animal to its environment . To Carlson it is a specific necessity for th development of the reproductive mechanism in males a for the lunar cycle in adult females . Both views are found in facts and are not in conflict . 3 Closely associated with the thyroid are two other endocrine which develop in the epithelium of an embryonic branch cleft or gill-arch . Of these the parathyroids are so close associated in post-natal life in some animals that it is imp sible to remove the thyroids without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1880 . They are about as big as peas and are paired , generally t on each side and near the thyroids . They also vary in number , size , and position ; they may extend far down the traches . Their function is not yet understood , nor is it yet known // they are glands of internal secretion . It is known that death follows their removal , generally in from twelve to forty-eight hours . Sometimes recovery seems assured , but death has only been postponed ? and not beyond fourteen days . Death is accompanied by tetany ? acute muscular convulsions , and not to be confounded with tetanus , or " lockjaw . " In some vases the hair and nails fall off , the teeth become loose and shed , and cataract of the eye develops . Hence it is inferred that they have to do with calcium metabolism . It is claimed that tetany may be cured by parathyroid feeding , but Carlson maintains that true tetany has not yet been cured by this method . Improvement may result from transplanting parathyroid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tetany and death follow . Parathyroid function is a condition of life . What is tetany ? Infantile tetany is called " fits " ; it is thought to be due to defective parathyroids . The calcium metabolism is upset : bad bone growth , the teeth do not calcify . The phosphate metabolism also seems to be upset : not enough phosphates are excreted . Also a tendency to acidosis in the blood , probably due to defective carbohydrate metabolism . A substance called methylguanidin appears in the urine and blood ; it is bad poison . Guanidin is also found in decomposing horseflesh , in culture of the anthrax bacillus , etc. ( ; tianidin increases neuromuscular excitability : fits , cramps , tetany spasms . A strychnine salt also does it . The ' motor responses to stimuli are no longer co-ordinated , but become convulsive ? " tetanized . " That is why the lockjaw germ is called the bacillus of tetanus . With it at work releasing its specific toxin , muscles of jaws and other skeletal muscles " lock . " Spasms follow the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synapses of the neuromotor system ? as strychnine and tetanus toxin supposed to . We seem to be far from the parathyroids . It is not known // if they secrete a hormone or if they are glands , but whatever they are they are vital structures , and certain death ? and death with certain accompaniments ? follows their removal . But Collip has recently reported that he has prepared an extract from animal parathyroids , which he calls parathyrin . With this he claims to control tetany in dogs , and to have treated a child in desperate condition with successful results . No one knows yet what constitutes a normal human parathyroid . There is even more doubt as to what is a normal thymus , or whether it is a gland , or what happens when it is removed . It lies just under the upper end of the breast bone , is well developed in the fetus , better developed at the age of two , largest at puberty . It then begins to lose its character and becomes connective tissue , lymphatic tissue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence it is assumed to hold back the development of the sex glands until puberty . Post-mortem examination of 400 idiots showed no thymus in 75 per cent . Its removal in young animals retards growth but hastens sexual development ; the sex glands remain weak , the body flabby and dwarfed . Riddle claims that the thymus lost its value for man and mammals when their ancestors began to incubate their eggs within their body and ceased laying them , as do birds and reptiles , with albumen and shells . That was the original function of the thymus . Pigeons whose thymus has been removed lay eggs without shells ; but if fed thymus , will lay normal eggs with shells . If your hens ' eggs have . too little albumen or a soft shell , feed your chickens dried thymus of an ox . And thank the thymus because its secretions made it possible for our reptilian ancestor to invent an egg that could evolve into a human ovum. 4 The adrenals , or suprarenals , get their name from their position just above the kidneys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large bean . But they vary : one or , in rare cases , both ? may be absent ; there may be accessory adrenals varying in size from a pin head to a large pea . Removal of one adrenal produces no known result . Removal of both is always fatal , often within a few hours . When death does not follow their removal it is because accessory adrenals are present and can function . The adrenal in some fishes is two separate organs . In the human embryo it begins as two ; these unite to form one body with two distinct parts : an outside cortex , or bark , and a medulla , or core , completely inclosed by the cortex . The cortex arises from the middle germ-layer and is derived from the Wolffian body , which also assists in the development of the urogenital system . The medulla is part of the outer germlayer and is derived from the same embryonic tissue as is the autonomic nervous system ; it is largely composed of nervelike tissue . Its importance is possibly second only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body is so well supplied with blood . Removal of the cortex is always followed by profound prostration , loss of appetite , apathy , labored respiration , weak and irregular heart , paralysis , and , within a few hours or days , death . Its secretion has not yet been isolated ; it is trot certain whether it is a secreting or a detoxicating organ . t is a vital organ . It appears to stimulate sex-gland growth and bring on sexual maturity . Its over-activity , as , for example , when involved in a tumor , makes for precocious sexual development . When it is infected , as it sometimes is in tuberculosis , a disease results called " Addison 's , " from its discoverer in 1855 . This is the only disease definitely known to he caused by insufficient adrenal cortex . It is as yet inurable and ends in death . Nor has the attempt to overcome cortical deficiency , due to disease or removal , yet met with access . Addison 's disease is accompanied by great muscular eakness , nervous depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the skin that a white skin looks like bronze . The medulla of the adrenals is possibly more important than the cortex . As it can not be removed without injury to the cortex , it is not yet certain that it is a vital organ as the cortex is known to be . Adrenin , the hormone of the medulla , was the first endocrine secretion to be isolated . Its derivative was discovered by Abel in 1897 and named " epinephrin " ; its pure form was isolated in 1901 by both Takamine and Aldrich . By 1908 it was so well understood that it was artifically produced from a coal-tar derivative . It is now a drug on the market and sold as epinephrin or adrenalin . Abel describes it as a **29;66;TOOLONG benzine or an " aromatic amino alcohol . " Here is its formula : And here is a curious fact . This remarkable drug is found in man in a gland of internal secretion . The principle of this drug is the constituent of a gland of external secretion in the skin of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonists , but Toad Ointment was known . Abel quotes the recipe : Good-sized live toads , 4 in number ; put into boiling water and cook very soft ; then take them out and boil the water down to half pint , and add fresh churned , unsalted butter , 1 pound , and simmer together ; at the last add tincture of arnica 2 ounces . What was Toad Ointment good for ? Sprains and rheumatism ! The Chinese still treat or " cure " dropsy with toad skin preparations , as did Europe up to 1775 , when it was supplanted by digitalis . But if the colonists had persevere they might have isolated from their toads , as did Abel , crystal composed of C18H24O4 and called bufagin ( but toad ) with the property of a powerful heart stimulant a thereby good for dropsy . But they could not have derived epinephrin from their toads because they did not have // right kind of toads . Epinephrin is found in the skin glands of external secretion of an Upper Amazon toad . The secretion of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natives , so powerful that in a few moments it will kill a deer or a jaguar . The skin of that Amazon toad contains both epinephrin and bufagin , both powerful drugs , acting fatally on the heart and blood vessels . Imagine what happens to the animal that eats that toad ! Which brings us back to adrenin , a powerful drug , a powerful cardio-vascular stimulant . Normally our blood contains about eight milligrams of it , which means that the proportion of adrenin to arterial blood is one part to a billion . Administered as one part in twenty million , it acts on the uterus and a useful drug in hemorrhages following delivery . It influences some tissues when diluted to one part in 100,000 , - ( M00 . It depresses the intestinal canal when diluted to one part in 330,000,000 ! What such dilution means has been worked out in terms of street sprinklers each of 625 gallons rapacity . A procession of such sprinklers twenty miles long and 200 to the mile would hold just enough water to dilute one ounce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adrenin is a drug , one of the most potent our body concocts . Yet adrenal feeding leads to no known or proved reIts . The administration of the drug adrenalin does lead profound results . Our body blood contains this drug . Whether it is made by or excreted by the adrenals is still an n question , but that adrenin has specific action on the ocular system , the nervous system , the blood , the alimentary nit I , and on sugar mobilization , there is no doubt . Nor tinge any doubt that when administered as a drug it inases the action of local anesthetics by constricting the blood vessels , thus preventing local loss of the anesthetic . And as this reduces the amount of anesthetic required , it s reduces the amount of toxin danger from the anesthetic. cheeks hemorrhages . It allays the spasms of acute bron. // chial asthma . It also stimulates weak hearts and fortifies the hearts of the old and infirm against the shock of operation . In short , adrenalin exerts an influence upon all smooth muscle enervated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its responsibility enormous , its influence on human destiny second to none . What , then , is the nature of this tiny but potent capsule tucked away in the depths of the abdominal cavity , nestling above the great excretory organs of the blood ? Recall the potency of a toad 's bufagin to control the heart , the potency of a toad 's epinephrin to kill a strong animal . Try to picture a molecule of human adrenin from the above formula . Realize the close association of the fundamental vital processes with the autonomic system . Is the human adrenal a " brain " which takes charge of us when we are confronted by emergencies which mean life or death ? It may be thought of in that way . 5 In crises our body goes on a " war footing " ? as our country did a few years ago . Piano manufacturers began to make airplanes . Artists turned from painting corset advertise . ments to camouflaging battleships . Our sugar rations were cut that the fighters might have enough . The entire plant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the engines of war . Life had become a dog-fight . Ever try to take a bone from a dog ? Or observe a cat when a dog suddenly appears ? Or a mother when some one injures her child ? How do you feel when you are " horror ; stricken , " " sick with disgust , " " paralyzed with fear , " " crazy with pain , " or so mad you " choke ? " Tongue cleaving tol the roof of the mouth , " cold-sweat , " pupils of the eyes dilateds pounding heart , hurried breathing , hair on end , muscles of face and especially of the lips trembling and twitching : su are among the obvious symptoms of pain , of horror , of fe etc. // We recognize many emotional states and are subject to them iu varying intensity : pain , anger , fear , rage , horror , sorrow , anxiety , grief , terror , disgust . An insulting word may literally alter our entire nature . We feel these states ; we observe the results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body itself often undergoes profound physiological change . The mechanism by which our natures can be suddenly altered is to be found in the middle or sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system and ? according to the theory ? the secretion of the medulla of the adrenal gland . The way these two work together and the striking , sudden , and far-reaching consequences of their actions , form the basis for Cannon 's claim in 1914 that adrenin is nature 's reply to the crises , the unexpected do-or-die emergencies of living animals . Emotional behavior gets its kick from adrenin . With adrenin cowards may fight for their lives , brave men may surpass themselves , and all of us can run as we never ran before ; or shed tears of sorrow over the loss of friends . There are three divisions of the autonomic nervous system . The upper , or cranial , is concerned with the joys and sorrows of life . Its nerves conserve the body , building up reserves and fortifying the body for times of crises . By narrowing the pupils they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heartbeat they give the heart muscles longer periods tor rest . By causing the mouth to water they set the juice owing and supply muscular tone for the alimentary canal 's useless movements . The lower , or sacral , division covers r emptying mechanisms of large intestine and urogenital " system ; relief and comfort acts . Between cranial and sacral is the sympathetic division- enormously important . It dilates the pupils of the eyes , hurry up heartbeat , stands hairs on end by causing each smooth hair-muscle to contract , opens sweat glands ( pouring out cry , heat ) , stops movements in stomach and intestine , rearm sugar ( the best fighting fuel ) from the liver ; and releases adrenin . The medulla of the adrenal , alone of all the // endocrine glands , is connected with the autonomic nervous system . Here is the point . Adrenin itself , injected into the blood , will dilate pupils , stand hairs on end , constrict blood vessels , stop the vegetative activities in alimentary canal , and release sugar from the liver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificially : adrenin will cause it to release sugar . The real business of the adrenal glands , according to Cannon 's theory , is emergency function . When we must fight or tun for our lives , our body has no time to fool with a mouth watering for its appetite or several yards of alimentary canal activity . The test tubes for chemical action , and the fires to keep these actions going , must be neglected for the moment . Their energy must be made available for action in the big striped muscles of the motor fighting-or-fleeing mechanism . When a joy is so strong or a sorrow or a disgust so deep that it breaks over the threshold of the cranial division and enters the sympathetic , we lose our appetite : no saliva , no gastric or pancreatic juice , no movement in the intestine . Even an empty stomach stops growling and holds its peace when war is on . And war is on when any of life 's instinctive acts with emotional trimmings are thwarted . Anger . The body is prepared to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to kill , how to avoid death . It has had to learn to count on its muscles and its nerves when the test comes . Adrenin is supposed to be the answer . According to Cannon 's theory , adrenin bucks us up . It speeds up the heartbeat . Draws blood from spleen , kidneys , intestines , and other inhibited organs of the abdomen ? thus also reducing their size . Drives blood to the skeletal muscles , brain , and lungs . Relaxes the smooth muscles of the tiny air sacs in the lungs , thus facilitating the exchange of carbon ' dioxide waste for the greater oxygen required in great effort . Orders the liver to give the blood more sugar , the optimum source of muscle energy . Drives fatigue from the muscles . // Contracts the blood vessels of the skin and makes the blood coagulate more quickly , so lessening our liability of bleeding to death in case of wound . Adrenin wins battles and makes men brave ; lack of it may make them cowards . It has been urged against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is proved is that without adrenals ? or accessory adrenals ? no man lives ; with adrenin far-reaching changes occur which , combined , transform the vegetation body into a fighting machine . Nor is there any doubt as to what our emotions do to us . The role that Cannon ascribes to the adrenals is reasonable and plausible ; it has proved to be a working hypothesis in biology . 6 The pituitary gland is about as big as the tip of the little finger , hangs from the base of the brain by a hollow stem ( hence also called the hypophysis cerebri ) , and is housed in a pocket of the sphenoid bone called the Turk 's saddle . It is as near the center of the head as it can get ; hence operation on the pituitary is enormously difficult . But if the patient - - dog or man ? does not die from brain injury , removal of the pituitary itself is not fatal . It is not a vital organ , but a normal pituitary is essential to normal life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and probably different in function . The anterior lobe is much the larger and is an ectoderm structure , arising as a fold of the lining of the mouth . Its structure is that of a gland and it has a rich blood supply . It does not remain constant in size . It seems to be associated with rate of growth and sexual development . Its removal is followed by many symptoms , but which are due to its removal , which to injuries to the brain , is uncertain . A substance called tethelin prepared from this lobe has been used experimentally and otherwise , but no chemical individual has yet been isolated . It is // claimed , but not proved , that tethelin hurries sexual maturity in the young and promotes sex activity in adults . The posterior lobe arises from the floor of the third ventricle of the brain and is largely nerve tissue . For a dozen years its active principle was known to science and used as an extract called pituitrin by physicians and surgeons , especially as a rival to ergot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childbirth , it caused several deaths , because it can so act on the uterus as to tear it open . Abel is convinced that the posterior lobe has only one hormone and not four , as had been claimed by German chemists . From it he has only recently isolated a pure tartrate which he characterizes as " extraordinarily potent " and endowed with several different and distinct properties . It is a thousand times more powerful than any hitherto known stimulant for non-skeletal muscle tissue ? a thousand times more powerful than the " extract " pituitrin which , wrongly used , could tear a uterus asunder ! Recall the twenty-mile procession of street sprinklers required to reduce an ounce of epinephrin to a test dose : to reduce an equal amount of Abel 's pituitary hormone would require not twenty miles of sprinklers , but 5,000 miles ! The actual test was made on a virgin guinea-pig 's uterus ; it contracted when suspended in a solution of one part hormone to 18,750,000,000 parts water . Such facts , as Hoskins says , make endocrinology kin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By restricting the small blood vessels it causes prolonged rise of blood pressure . It acts upon the respiration , causing a rhythmic increase of breathing up to a certain degree of rapidity , then a gradual decrease again to a temporary stoppage of breathing . When injected daily it has proved a remarkable remedy in the disease known as diabetes insipidus , not to be confounded with sugar or mellitus diabetes . In the latter the kidneys eliminate sugar that belongs to the blood and is needed by // the body . In insipidus , it is claimed the kidneys leave so much sugar in the blood that the body gets fat . But the danger in diabetes insipidus is the excessive and uncontrollable elimination of water by the kidneys and a consequent incessant thirst . " Joe , " the fat boy of Pickwick Papers , had a fat chest , flabby muscles , and sexual infantilism . To-day " Joe " would be diagnosed as dystrophic adiposogenitalis . The anterior lobe of his pituitary was probably diseased and consequently under-functioned . Too much activity in the anterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to gigantism , in later life to acromegaly . There seems to be no doubt that the pituitary gland is closely related to growth , especially in connective tissue , cartilage and bone , and sex-gland activity . But where abnormal growth occurs it is rarely possible to say whether it results from specific activity ? too much or too little ? in the gland , or from the pressure of a tumor on or in the gland or on the floor of the third ventricle of the brain . Other glands than the pituitary may he involved when the pituitary itself is abnormal . Whether the pituitary was the primary or the secondary cause of the upset in response to growth stimuli is not yet known . Abnormal adult growth changes known as acromegaly are characteristic and unmistakable : enlarged bones of the head , hands , and feet , general lassitude , pains in the muscles , lack of interest , and depressed sex activity often leading to impotence or amenorrhea . The famous Irish giant Magrath had a pituitary as big as a hen 's egg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a massive appendage to a huge face . A diseased pituitary in a normal adult caused the face to grow massive and ugly , with bulging masses about the eyes , the nose huge , the lips thick ; the chest huge and barrel-shaped ; the hands and feet of enormous size . A dwarf of twenty years with an under-developed pituitary had the bones of a // child a few weeks old . Another dwarf of mature years and .4o tiny as to have been " served " in a pie at the Duke of Buckingham 's table in honor of the Queen of Charles I , began a second period of growth . Some alteration in the pituitary , possibly . That the pituitary is concerned in sex growth is inferred from the fact that it becomes enlarged following castration ; as it also does during pregnancy when the ovaries temporarily change their function . It is suggestive also that at that time the hands sometimes enlarge and the face changes . Perhaps no structure , in proportion to its size , is more interesting or of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grain of wheat , it lies high up in the base of the brain behind and above the pituitary . It reaches full development at the seventh year , then begins to atrophy , and in adults has become connective tissue and " brain sand " : minute grains of phosphate and carbonate of lime . This " sand " is often found elsewhere in the brain , even in fetal life . Descartes held that the pineal is the seat of the soul . He was long on philosophy , but short on comparative anatomy . Yet possibly he was nearer the truth than he realized . Millions of years ago the pineal was a third eye and looked straight up to heaven . Extinct reptiles have a hole in tli skull for this pineal eye . The sphenodon , an almost extinct New Zealand reptile , is the only living animal with a pineal organ that resembles a true eye . Most lizards have a pineal organ , and , above , a hole in the roof of the skull . The hole is covered by a scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true eye , it may serve as an organ for sensing lights and shadows . Except the lowest fishes , all vertebrates have a relic of this " eye . " In Man the " relic " has a vestige of the optic nerve . No pineal hormone has yet been discovered , nor is it yet certain that it is a gland . Nothing certain is known of its function , nor is it certain that it has any importance beyond // pre-adolescence , if it has any then . From the fact that tumors of the pineal are often associated with precocious mental and sexual development , it is inferred that its business is to promote early physical growth and retard sexual development . But this is only inference ? the tumor may also have involved the mid-brain. 7 To Lavoisier 's dictum : " Life is a chemical function , " we might add , " and ceases to function without sugar . " At any rite , we eat more sugar than we should , because our body finds sugar where we little suspect it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep life on the move . When anything happens to our sugar refinery , sugar storage , or sugar delivery , we suffer from one of several more or less fatal diseases . The regulator of sugar metabolism is a group of secreting organs known as the islands of Langerhans , in the " sweetbreads " or pancreas , and which act as a gland of internal secretion . Its hormone , insulin , is delivered direct to the blood . Pancreatic juice , an important digestive fluid , is delivered by the duct of Wirsung to the alimentary canal . Diabetes ( from the Greek " to go through " ) follows when the islands of Langerhans stop functioning . The isolation of insulin , chiefly due to Banting and McLeod , ends a search of many long years and closes one of the most interesting chaprs in the new science of endocrines . There is a remedy for diabetes mellitus , but no cure . Life can be prolonged " infinitely " ; but insulin feeding alone will not prevail without control of diet . It is significant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country 90 per cent are overweight ; and that of those over fifty years of age there are twenty fat for every thin diabetic sufferer . From which we infer that the human pancreas as regulator of sugar metabolism tends // to break down when we take on more fat than we require . We take on fat when we eat more sugars and fats than we use up . The pancreas is a very vital organ . Its removal , or the removal of seven-eighths of it , is followed by a condition like that of diabetes : increased urine , abnormal thirst and hunger , death . Its hormone , delivered to the blood , regulates the output of glycogen from the liver , and is necessary for the building of glycogen and the oxidation of sugar by the body tissues . This is the route : The portal blood carries glucose to the liver . The liver converts glucose into glycogen ( animal starch ) . The liver itself is not an endocrine gland , although it does deliver sugar to the blood direct . It stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stores vitamins ; it destroys fat ; it stores glycogen . It is a vital organ . Nothing takes its place or can do its refining . All its processes depend upon its own liver cells . How it converts sugar into animal starch for storage purposes and how it reconverts it into sugar when the secretion from the islands of Langerhans tells it to do so , are not known . It does . If the islands stop sending messages , the liver gives up all its sugar to the blood , but the body cells can not store or burn it and so it is filtered by the kidneys from the blood and passed on to the bladder . The spleen has no duct ; it has no secretions . It is not a gland . Just what it is no one knows . Its functions are not specific , nor does its removal seem to impair health , growth , or longevity . In the fetus it is probably an incubator for red blood-cells ; after birth it seems to be an incinerator of red blood-cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from ten to fifteen days . Perhaps 10 per cent of all red blood-cells are destroyed each day . It is possible that an " enlarged " spleen destroys red cells faster than it should ; it may therefore be responsible for chronic anemia . It does produce a chemical catalyzer ; its enzymes convert nucleins into uric acid . The secretions of the stomach and small intestine ? gastrin // and secretin ? are drugs to be used on the spot . They are dangerous drugs if used elsewhere in or on the body . Stomach and intestine may produce hormones . May . If they do , they presumably regulate the pancreas , gastric glands , etc . Neither lymph nor lymph " gland " has any endocrine function . Nor has the blood . A quart of my blood may tide you over until you can make enough to supply your loss . But my blood is my blood ; it is in dynamic equilibrium , constantly changing to meet the specific requirements of the particular families of cells on its route in my body . Kidneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are good as food . But " extract of kidney " is as good to repair a faulty kidney , or to treat uremia or nephritis , as powdered glass is to restore a watch crystal . The kidney is not a gland , it secretes nothing . It is a filter or excretory organ . Other " extracts " are doped out to meet the demand . Brains for dementia praecox , tetanus , epilepsy , etc . Such treatment , says Carlson , is " less rational than the principles and practices of Mrs. Eddy . Perhaps we could make for greater rogress if the manufacturers of dried brains could be Evinced to use the brains of horses instead of asses and sheep for their raw material , and the finished product was taken by the doctor instead of being given to the patient . " Dried lungs , tonsils , retina , iris , nasal mucous membrane , and such can be had in the drug stores ; " cures " for tuberculosis , tonsilitis , etc . Rubbish . The few hormones that are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they have encouraged imitators . The result is a new crowd quacks , ready to " feed " anybody anything that sounds like something and is therefore presumably a remedy . 8 Gonads is Greek for seeds . As the organs or glands of production of both sexes produce seeds , it is a convenient NI polite word for testes and ovaries . But the newspapers in // referring to gonad operations , rejuvenescence , etc. , always speak of " glands . " Only the context makes it certain that the " glands " referred to are not the parotid or thyroid or some other equally " respectable " gland . This reluctance ? which Robinson characterizes as " shamefaced , prudish , and squeamish " ? to face the facts necessary to solve some of the simple but vital problems of everyday life is almost a chronic psychosis , with signs now and then of a tendency to sanity . Psychology has diagnosed the " impurity complex " and shown us what is back of the blatant prude who advertises his or her " purity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when purchased at the price of a stifled natural curiosity , is not a safe and sane " purity . " The study of biology has begun to break down this impurity complex and the unholy , unnatural doctrine begun by early Christian monks that the sex impulse is man 's sign of degradation and the source of his most devilish energy . Nature knows better . Sex is a primary biologic function of all life above the lowest . Its characters and qualities have an ancient lineage . Its impulse is as real as is the force which makes the tides to ebb and flow . It has profoundly influenced structure and behavior . It is a fundamental element of all higher life ; its external characters a neat advertising dodge of Nature by which she sells her wares and thereby insures her family . To sex we owe more than poetry ; we owe the song of birds , all vocal music and the voice itself , the plumage that comes to supreme glory in the bird of paradise , the mane of the lion , the tresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard of men , and all higher forms of life in plant and animal world . It is woven into every fabric of human life and lays its finger on every custom . To the debit side of the sex account we must charge many silly stupidities and some of the foulest injustices which go to make the thing we call human culture the amazing and variegated mosaic that it is . We are more enlightened than we were , but we have not // yet reached the stage where the mere mention of sex will not provoke some one to respond with a reproach or an insult . Whole blocks on Main Street assume that " sex knowledge " is of questionable propriety , or , at best , to be kept dark in " doctor-books " ; or regard it as the banal possession of the frankly shameless . As a result , most pseudo-scientific " sex " literature slops over into the emotions and lets facts alone , or presents facts under disguises . Much of it has no biologic background or anything of the laws of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is fear ( sometimes called " reverence " ) that makes us " let sex alone . " It is mock modesty and foolish shame , masquerading under the name " decency , " that compels museums to clothe marble Fauns and plaster Joves and bronze Cupids with plaster-ofParis fig leaves , often awry or nicked at the corner . Back of much of this confusion and nonsense is the paradox which culminated in Puritanism : Marriage is a divine institution and the god of Love is a saint , but sex is shameful and Cupid is a carnal beast . Man is " high , " " animals " are " low " ? without minds and of course can have no " souls . " We have . Ours is a " divine " parentage , our bodies " sacred . " Hence art , from Phidian sculpture to sophomoric poem , tends to the greater Iory of Man : men and women more like gods and godesses ; gods and goddesses glorified men and women . And so it came about that the commonest thing in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven . Love begins with a capital " L " because it is sacred . So it is . Without it the world of man stops . There would be no more fishes in the sea if the males did not like the females . Love is fine . Put it on a pedestal , magnify it , glorify it , deify it . But why leave Cupid on the pedestal ? To worship him blindly is on a par with any other fetishism , and quite as intelligent . Take him down and dust him off , repair his broken ears , mend his battered nose , refeather his // arrows and restring his bow . Why not have a look at him ? What is he made of ? 9 Certain glands are essential to life . Their removal is followed by death . Not so the gonads proper . They may be removed , in fact are constantly being removed ? especially those of women ? in the operating rooms . What happens ? The patient lives . The gonads are not necessary for individual life , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between men and women are sexual . There are primary and secondary differences . The secondary characters begin to assume definite form in both sexes at the beginning of puberty . These characters are byproducts of the male and female gonads . The gonads are like true duct glands in that they discharge their secretion through ducts , but this secretion , unlike that of other duct glands , is not discharged into and consumed by the parent body . The gonads have an additional function : they secrete a hormone which regulates the appearance and growth of the secondary characters and supplies the impulse hack of sex behavior . In this they are like true endocrines , which deliver their regulating secretions direct to the blood stream . Thus the gonads are also glands of internal secretion . For ages it has been known that boys or girls deprived of their gonads before puberty develop into " womanly " men or " manly " women and throughout life retain an infantile typ. of body . Eunuchs ( " guardians of the couch , " created fo religious and social ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ; in women similarly altered the mammar glands remain undeveloped , their bodies do not become s ? feminine . Experiments on chickens show that when the ovaries ar . completely removed from a young hen , she begins to take // on the secondary sexual characters of the male : she develops comb , wattles , and spurs ; her plumage becomes more brilliant ; she grows larger ; she takes on the typical behavior of the rooster . This can only mean that the ovary itself , by its own internal secretion taken up into the blood stream , has power to modify the body in the direction of the female sex . It has been inferred that secondary male characters were potentially present in the hen , but were inhibited by the ovaries . Moore implanted a piece of ovary in a young male guineapig . His body was modified ; his teats came to resemble those of a pregnant female . His behavior showed no sign of acquired feminine instincts . Another investigator reports " timid , shy , and mothering-the-young " behavior of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male gonad transplanted into an altered young female leads to change in both body and behavior . She becomes aggressive , quarrelsome , and behaves like a typical male toward other males and toward females in general . Her physical modification is equally profound . Cattle breeders have long known that the female of bisexual twins is generally sterile and tends toward the male In physical characters . Such sterile females are called freemartins . Lillie investigated . The twins , it seems , develop Independently in the two horns of the cow 's uterus , but join below in the outer fetal envelope . Through this they exchange blood . The precocious hormone of the fetal male fertilizes the fetal female ovary ! It seems so extraordinary a to be almost incredible . But there is no doubt about sterile freemartins , nor about fact of their intercommunicating arterial blood stream fetal development . Lillie 's conclusions mean that the ale fetus secretes a specific gonad hormone before its grinds are really formed ; this male hormone sterilizes the tale gonad . The fact that both pancreas and thyroid hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight to the inference that the sex hormones themselves are produced by the primitive germ cells . That there is no exchange of gonad hormones between the human fetus and its mother seems evident from the fact that the developing male fetus does not influence the sex life of the mother . In other words , while the nature of the sex impulse is the same in the two sexes , the sex hormones themselves are not the same . But they are not antagonistic . " Maleness " can be produced in females ; " femaleness " in males . The male hormone in a young spayed female modifies both her behavior and her body . The female hormone in a castrated young male body modifies only the body . The male fetus does not modify its mother : she is still in possession of her own gonads . The male fetus modifies the behavior and sterilizes the gonads of its twin female fetus . Human twins , if " identical , " are always of the same sex ; if not identical there is no exchange of blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult female gonads in mammals contain ova in varying stages of ripening and interstitial stroma or cells . Both seem to have an identical origin and both pass through similar changes in development . The ova or germ-cells develop in Graafian follicles . When ripe they burst through the wall of the ovary . The ovum escapes . The ruptured follicle reassembles and enlarges for about a week , filling the rent in the ovarian wall . Then it breaks up and is absorbed before the next follicle matures . But if the ovum. is fertilized , the follicle continues to develop for three months and then persists until the end of pregnancy . The ruptured and changing follicle is called the corpus luteum ( yellow body ) because of its color after the escape of the ovum . Corpora lutea are supposed to produce a // hormone . The ovary does produce hormones , how or where is not well understood ; nor , in fact , has the ovary itself parted with half of its mysteries . Removal of the ovary or its absence or atrophy in the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The primary sexual characters , including the breasts , remain in an infantile condition . The lunar cycle does not appear . The body tends toward fat . Removal in the adult leads to atrophy of the primary sexual characters , the suppression of all sex functions , and of most sex behavior . The ovary can be transplanted from one part of the body to another ; it long continues to function as an endocrine gland , no femininity is lost , nor does the lunar cycle cease . When transplanted from one body to another it may form blood connections , but it eventually degenerates . But as long as a piece of it remains alive in its new hostess her sex life , including lunar cycle , continues " normal . " For transplantation purposes a bit is as good as the entire ovary . Where , then , does its hormone come from ? It produces one : Carlson thinks probably several . None has yet been isolated or can be detected hi the human blood . But Allen and Doisy claim to have isolated a mammalian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of romance and literature . " Female animals treated with it take the initiative in courtship , even at an early age . " Injected into young animals , they " become mature before they normally would . " ' Phis hormone is an " extract of the contents " of the Graafian follicles . Why not ? It is all plausible . Nothing seems more certain than that the sex impulse and all secondary sexual characters in all mammalian females are dependent upon the normal functioning of the ovaries . The physiological and anatomical changes in the Graafian follicles during the life cycle are both profound and significant . As they are the source of the ova , it is reasonable // to suppose that they carry the control of sex impulse or behavior and the acquired secondary characters . When the follicle erupts and discharges the ovum , it becomes the corpus luteum . When the corpus luteum is destroyed , pregnancy ends and ovulation is resumed . Hence the inference that the corpus luteum is responsible for uterine changes leading to the implantation of the embryo and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fed to hens , they lay no eggs ; hence the inference that during pregnancy they inhibit the ripening of the Graafian follicle and so prevent ovulation and menstruation and restrain the sex impulse . They influence the mammary glands , but the development of these during pregnancy is believed to be due to hormones from the fetus to the maternal blood . The mamma themselves are not known to have any endocrine function . Their removal does not prevent child-bearing or have any other effect than " psychic and cosmetic , " according to Carlson . But removal of the ovary is removal of feminine nature . No mammals below Primates have anything approaching the specific lunar cycle of a woman 's life between puberty and the menopause . While slight menstrual hemorrhage occurs in many species of Primates , it is essentially a human process regulated by the normal and mature ovum , but its function is not yet understood nor is there agreement as to just what takes place or why there is such wide range of individual variation . The climacteric is reached when no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menopause ? in woman may be due to other than ovarian deficiencies : other endocrines may be involved , perhaps the adrenals or the pituitary . It is not certain that ovarian extracts are anything but . extracts and so of possible value only through suggestion . Nor can luteal extracts check human ovulation ; the corpus luteum can . Nor is it at all certain that any ovarian extracts on the market contain any hormone . It is certain that the // normal ovary , through its hormones , functions for all secondary female characters and has the specific sex functions for such distant organs as uterus , placenta , and mammae . The functions of personal incubation assumed by one-half of the race ages ago necessitated an elaborate internal mechanism . For its perfect functioning , elaborate and complicated controls were necessary . It follows , and is biologically inevitable , that the sex life of the female of the human species is far more complex than is that of the male . But it is biologically conceivable that in a no great distant future reproduction in the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ovaries of only physically sound individuals would be used and to the limit of their two hundred ova ; these would be fertilized artificially and developed in man-made incubators . Such control of human life seems quite attainable ; much more so than the synthesis of life in any form . 11 The male gonads contain spermatogonia . These develop into germ-cells and fertilize the ovum . This involves two factors : the ovum is stimulated to develop ; the male inheritce is afforded a vehicle . The gonad performs this unction through external secretions . But as the spermatogonia themselves are cells early set aside in embryonic development and are not products of chemical change as are du . secretions of other duct glands , the gonads in their reproductive functions are not comparable to other glands . They , the ovaries , are arsenals where ammunition for life is cultivated Between the cell clusters where spermatogonia develop are other groups of cells , the interstitial cells of Leydig . These gills appear in the embryo before the spermatogonia cells . rider the X-rays they are not affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend , or in one transplanted into // another body , the germ-cells atrophy ; the Leydig cells are unaffected or may increase in size . Thus they show greater power of resistance than the germ-cells ; they are embryologically older . Absence , atrophy , or extirpation of the gonads in the young male prevents the appearance of the secondary sexual characters ? beard , change in the larynx and character of skeleton ? and checks development of the reproductive mechanism . It also delays the final ossification of the heads of the long bones and the sutures of the skull . It lowers the rate of metabolism , increases the tendency to take on fat , and lowers vasomotor irritability . It perhaps leads to changes in the endocrine system , enlarging the adrenal cortex and the pituitary , diminishing thyroid growth , checking thymus involution . It changes behavior : less bold , less pugnacious , more infantile ; it shuts off the sex impulse . In the adult , loss of gonads stops the sex impulse and tends to atrophy of the reproductive mechanism , to obesity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortened , nor mental or physical efficiency impaired . Hence , as Carlson points out , " growing old " is not to be charged to gonad dysfunction , but to damage by age to all the tissues of the body . Gonad removal leads only to loss of structure and function specific for sex life . Curiously , evidence seems to indicate that gonadectomy in the two sexes leads to opposite changes in the adrenals : in males , to an increase of 15 per cent ; in females , to a decrease of 20 per cent . The net result is to increase the resemblance between the two sexes . The spermatogonia cells are simply future germs . This throws the responsibility for the regulation of the development of sex mechanism and function on the interstitial cells . Moore has recently furnished new proof of this . In cryptorchic individuals ( the gonads remain within the abdominal cavity ) there may or there may not be spermato- // gonia ; if not , the individual is , of course , sterile , but if the Leydig cells are present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behavior . When the vas deferens or excretory duct of the gonad is ligatured , the spermatogonia are said , but not proved , to atrophy ; the germ-cells can not , of course , be discharged and consequently the individual is sterile . But as long as the Leydig cells are intact , sex life is unimpaired . This is the basis of the famous operation of Steinach , and is based on wo assumptions : that ligation of the vas deferens increases Leydig cell growth ; that it causes the spermatogonia appatalus to atrophy . Neither of these assumptions is yet proved ; in fact , Oslund asserts that both assumptions are contrary to fact , that vasectomy produces no testicular changes and " can not be looked upon as a method of causing rejuvenescence . When gonads are transplanted into other male bodies , the individual maintains sex life as long as enough Leydig cells remain alive . This was Steinach 's first method of " rejuvenation " : " a biological futility , a catering by the surgeon to the elements of sex degeneracy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from goat or monkey , " the surgeon is the monkey , the patient is the goat . " Grafts of goats or monkeys are not yet known to become ascularized , nor is it known that the Leydig cells survive p to two years . It is known that the sperm-cells do not rvive transplanting . It is not settled how long a gonad will have after removal : " most glands die in a few hours . " At ost , the graft can only temporarily restore the sex impulse ; y true " rejuvenescence " of mind or body can only come from suggestion . Suggestion likewise , thinks Carlson , is all that backs the bole tribe of " genital " extracts on the market and which are guaranteed " cures " for everything from growing pains 1a melancholia , including goiter , scurvy , cholera , anemia , delirium tremens , and syphilis . // The adrenal cortex and Leydig cells have a common embryonic origin , but they come to have quite different functions . No gland can play the role of the Leydig cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only compensation possible is in the direction of general metabolism . In both sexes , gonad hormones are specific regulators of sex characters up to puberty ; the hormones that sustain sex life during maturity are possibly quite different from those which determined development . They are the catalyzers of development ; they must vary with the stage or degree of development . 12 The race of bisexual animals depends on the coming together of male and female . Moths find their mates by their olfactory antennae ; fishes , by color and behavior ; frogs , by voice and touch ; birds , by voice and sight ; mammals , by scent . Man is a mammal , but he has traded his scent organ for a nose and he kills his odor with soaps or artificial scents . He discovers his mate , as do birds , by voice and sight . Either sex , deprived of the gonads , has no need for secondary characters ; nor do they appear unless the gonads function as endocrine or " puberty " glands . That is the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing structure that the two sexes already determined in prenatal development will not look or sound alike , but will look and sound good to each other . Secondary sex characters , therefore , are additional devices of nature for making each sex easily recognized by and more attractive to the opposite sex . Hence the " instinctive " repugnance of normal men for " manly " women ; of normal women for " womanly " men . Puberty means sexual maturity ; the individual is ready - to assume the next stage in normal development : parentage . Modern life departs from the normal ; it pays no attention to the facts of puberty . The age of marriage tends to become // more and more remote from sex maturity ; the education of the youth proceeds as though there were no such thing as puberty . In normal life in girls , as in the females of all mammals , the milk glands at puberty take on rapid growth . The most noticeable changes in the boy are the appearance of hair on the face and a startling change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larynx . The voice at first breaks ; by the time it becomes normal again it has , as a rule , dropped one full octave . Meanwhile the boy outgrows his collars faster than he does his hats . In both sexes hair n ! pears on the pubes . While early growth depends on the amount and nature of the food and on general hygienic conditions , puberty as a rule appears earliest in individuals of short stature . Thus , it comes earlier among Italians than Scandinavians , the difference agreeing with the relative statures of the two peoples . Girls of European descent grow faster than boys between the ages of ten and fifteen . Between eleven and fourteen the iris are actually taller ; between twelve and fifteen , heavier . t fifteen the rate of the girl 's growth begins to diminish . e skeleton begins to mature , for both sexes , at puberty . e girl 's pelvic girdle undergoes a marked change in width . . also becomes more plump . Between the fourteenth and eighteenth years for girls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new impulse enters life . This impulse , only vaguely present fore , is now the impelling force . For this reason : puberty means more than mere physical change , it means sex maturity ; it is a result as well as an event . Besides the ysical changes which increase the demands for foodrgy , the whole organism is involved in maturity . The boy or girl is now preoccupied with a new order of lei affairs . This necessarily involves the entire nervous ' hnnism ? not in its structure , but in the nature of the // situations to which it must now adjust the individual . The second great crisis in life is at hand . It is a different individual , the world itself is different . Up till now the primordial instinct of self-preservation has had only one main drive : food-hunger ; to this is now added the drive of mate-hunger . It enters the race fresh and will have its say . The body itself , under both direct and indirect influence of the sex mechanism , is stirred to its depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the susceptibility of the brain is increased through the vasomotor nerves . The outcome of the conflict is determined by many factors . In animal life and the majority of the human race , the result is courtship and mating . We generally solve the problem satisfactorily , but promiscuity and certain unbiologic and unsocial habits , with sex complexes leading to neuroses , seem to be increasing . But the real point in all this is that the gonads normally do function as endocrine glands . As a consequence the two sexes do differ , in bodily structure , in behavior , in organic necessity . As Ellis puts it : " A man is a man to his very thumbs , and a woman is a woman down to her little toes . " Specialization in bodies is older than civilization , and there has always been a real difference between men and women beyond that of the primary sex organs . Which prompts Keith to remark : " No legislation can blot out structural differences that have taken geological epochs to produce . " But substitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of female birds that laid eggs and were in all respects true females ; they ceased to be females , became males in form and function , and fathered young . No surgical operation involved : only destruction of female organs due to tuberculosis ; male organs replaced them , followed by male behavior . What all this signifies is not yet known . But this much , at least : sexual characters depend on sex hormones ; complete sex-transformation in adults is possible . // 13 Shorn of her locks and dressed in man 's costume , woman is still woman . Yet how many times she has passed for a man ? as a sailor , a soldier , a coal-miner ! Her femininity tends to disappear beneath the male 's make-up . The two sexes differ in degree rather than in kind . The assumption that women are not as " adult " as men has no basis in fact . Yet we keep hearing about the " infantile " character of woman ! Her body does more nearly resemble the infant 's than does the male 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is essentially " human , " her body is more human than man 's . The adult male may be less infantile than the adult female ; he is also less essentially " human . " The typical female skull is so delicate and smooth that sex can be postulated nineteen times out of twenty . It has none of the asperities , ridges , and prominences which mark the skull of the male . The bones of her face , especially of the jaws , are much more " human " than are the corresponding hones in man 's jaws . The weight of the skull compared with the weight of the long bones shows this interesting progression : greatest proportionate weight of skull , children first , women next ; then abort men , tall men , apes . In weight of skull compared with at of thigh bones , the advantage again is with woman . Our pelvic girdle is in some respects more " human " than the skull itself . It is the distinguishing sex trait in the skeleton . To the trained observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that of a male . A moment 's reflection will show why this should be so . In man , the pelvis supports the abdominal viscera and continues the support of the upright body from the legs . To perform these two functions it became modified in two directions : broader , by expansion of the iliac crests ; more compact and substantial , by a greater , broader sacrum . The sacrum is the key of the // pelvic arch ; it carries the backbone , and incidentally the entire upper part of the body . Woman 's pelvis has traveled further than man 's in this regard . Her breadth across iliac crests is proportionately greater than the depth from pubic symphysis to top of sacrum . Her sacrum also is more distinctively human in its great breadth . The two bones which form the basin of the pelvis ? of which the iliac crests are easily felt beneath the skin at the sides of our abdomen ? meet in front to form the pubic symphysis . The joint of the symphysis is made by a strong ligament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ligament is narrow ; in the female , wide . The slope of the pubic bones below the joint is also greater in the female , an additional factor in enlarging the outlet of her pelvis . Can our pelvic girdle become more " human " ? The upper rim might become better adjusted to support the body , but a girdle so narrowed as to prevent childbirth stops variation in that direction . This seems to set a limit to the size of the human brain at birth . In most still-born deliveries the head is too large to pass the bony outlet of the pelvis . We may assume that the limit of brain size at birth has been reached . Man 's pelvis is long , narrow , strong ; woman 's , broad , shallow , delicate , roomy . Her thighs are relatively greater . Her carriage differs from man 's because the heads of her thigh bones are farther apart . As she transfers her body from one thigh to the other in walking , she must make a greater effort . Her pelvis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet to make childbirth possible . Women among so-called savages are notoriously as strong as men , although there is always a division of labor between the sexes . The most splendid human bodies I have ever seen were those of black women working under extremely primitive conditions in gold and emerald mines in South America . Their backs , shoulders , and arms spoke of great strength , but there were no bulging muscles . Even apart // from their breasts , their bodies were unmistakably " feminine . " The luxuriant head hair of women of European descent is not a mark of sex : it is the barber that makes ? or made ? the difference . Chinese and Indians were proud of their hair and had as much of it as their spouses . Head hair is a race and culture and not a sex factor . Sex differences are strongly marked in brain size among man and apes . The male gorilla 's brain is 18 per cent larger than the female 's ; the orang 's , 14 per cent ; the chimpanzee 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the disparity is due to general disproportion in size between the two sexes . Structurally the brains of the two sexes are the same , and as compared to weight of body are heavier in women than in men . If a relatively large brain is a " human " trait , the brain of the child stands Highest , woman next . More males are born than females ; in the so-called white races , about 105 males for every 100 females . Yet woman 's longevity counter-balances the disproportion ; at the age of fitty , unless migrations or wars upset the calculation , we may expect to find as many women as men . Differences between the two sexes , yes . The male specializes in the direction of brute strength and the courage at goes with it ; the female retains her youthfulness in body general and especially in face and neck .

" // 14 The endocrines are new to science ; some have only recently been discovered ; the function of some only recently suspected ; not one is yet perfectly understood . Yet their astounding importance , and the claims quacks make that gland " extracts " are cure-alls and gonad operations a Fountain of Youth , conspire to whet the appetite for facts faster than the laboratories can sift them out . Hence new crops of quacks who dispense pills or elixirs or their services with a knife or a ligature ; and a raft of literature which , as Hoskins says , " for its vagaries , fantastic exuberance , and wholesale marvel-mongering , is without a peer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of endocrine co-operation , or what takes place in some when others fail . No gland or other organ functions for or by itself , or lives a life of independence ; the entire body mechanism makes up the organism . The business of the glands is the business of the body as a going concern , to keep it fit and enable it to function , as infant , as youth , as adult , as senility overtakes it . Carlson thinks the following endocrine teamwork probable : the gonads can not function if the thyroid and possibly the pituitary and adrenal cortex are subnormal ; removal of thyroid and probably of gonads stimulates the pituitary ; thyroid extract seems to stimulate the adrenals and the pituitary , as it does the heart , liver , and kidneys ; removal of the thyroid stimulates the parathyroids ? at least in tad . poles ; tumor of the adrenals induces gonad precocity ; removal of the gonads retards atrophy of the thymus an . leads to change in pituitary and adrenal cortex . It seems certain that removal of the thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; of the para . thyroids , by death ; of the pancreas , by death ; of the adrenals , by death ; of the pituitary , by infantilism in children , b impotence in adults ; of the thymus , by sexual precocity ; of // the gonads , by sex infantilism in children , by atrophy of secondary sex characters in adults ; of the pineal , by no known endocrine effect . Most of each endocrine may be removed from an animal without apparent loss of function of its internal secretion ; the inference is that no endocrine normally works to its full capacity . A normal thyroid stores up enough to last several weeks ; the adrenin reserve only suffices for a few hours . But in general almost nothing is known of the storage capacity or rate of production of hormones . It is known that symptoms may not appear after removal of the thyroid for weeks or months . Removal of the pancreas is followed by symptoms within ten hours ; of the parathyroids and adrenal cortex , almost at once . Post-mortems prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Addison 's disease and death ; pituitary with infantilism ; pancreas with diabetes . Known positive results from large endocrines or excessive endocrine secretions are few ; it is not yet proved that large lands yield large results . It is only inference that excessive yroid secretion causes toxic goiter ; of the anterior lobe of the pituitary , gigantism ; of the adrenal medulla and the thyroids , excess pep ; of the adrenal cortex , the pineal and pituitary , sex precocity ; of the gonads , excessive sex urge ; f the thyroid , diabetes . Results claimed for excessive thymus and pineal activity are not yet proved . As their loss produces no known effect , what could necessarily result from 1eir increased function ? Can endocrine disorders be " cured " through the nerves of endocrine secretion ? The pineal , the posterior lobe of the pituitary , and the medulla of the adrenals are themselves modified nerve cells . But , except the medulla , neither the gutting of all the nerves to all the endocrines nor artificial Stimulation shows any effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the endocrines seemingly have little or nothing to do with their secretions . But most // quacks feed their patients " gland extracts . " Few hormones are yet known . Apart from insulin , adrenalin , pituitrin , and thyroxin , the quacks themselves know nothing further of any of the various extracts they often feed for unknown diseases . With " diet and rest , " extracts are as potent as the bread pills of old . The endocrines are part of the body , and so subject to heredity , tumors , lesions , tuberculosis and other infections , especially to faulty metabolism . The influence of the thyroid and pancreas on general metabolism and growth is fundamental . They must , therefore , influence all the body , including all the glands . The thyroid normally functions only if there is enough iodine in the food . If in doubt , take codliver oil or eat sea grass . 15 The endocrine glands are intrinsic parts of the body , in intimate touch with living processes . Muscular activity starts the sweat glands , the muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the blood to neutralize the toxins of fatigue , and so on . Arrest of development or over-stimulation of the endocrines brings about change which may be harmful or of benefit to the body . Giants , fat women , cretins , men and women under-sexed and over-sexed , imply variation in the structure and functioning of these glands . Apparently some individuals are better fitted for the work of life than others ; still others are so well fitted that they overdo it . No two human beings are exactly alike ; they do not and can not act alike . We should hesitate before passing harsh moral judgments upon activities due to inherited or acquired physical structure . Possibly several generations must pass before the real and definite function of the endocrines is fully understood . Possibly new drugs will replace the old ; pills compounded on // formula learned in nature 's laboratory , elixirs for all the ills of body and mind we are now heir to . The fact that the emotions are expressions of states under control of the glands and closely bound up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for speculative possibilities . Russell thinks it will be possible to make people hot-headed or timid , strongly or weakly sexed , and so on , as may be desired . In case of war the timid souls will simply be injected with certain glandular extracts or synthesized regulators ! There is another angle . Almost nothing has yet been done on the racial anatomy of the endocrines . Are shape and size of head , face , nose , eyes , teeth , lips , length of limbs , and stature , character and shape of hair , due to the activity of the endocrines ? Keith thinks this possible and suggests that whites are what they are because they have more thyroid , adrenal , pituitary , and gonad hormones than other races , and that inherited condition of glands points a mechanism through which heredity controls development and established type variations . Racial character ? such as emotional reactions , intellectual capacity , and personality in general ? would thus vary likewise , and for the same reason . This compounding of elixirs for all ills from endocrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual variability by reference to variation in glandular mechanism and functioning , take us too far from reality , too far into possibilities . We of to-day are going concerns and our interest In the past is only in the light it can shed on what we are anal can do to-day . And that is a personal question ? for this reason : No two human beings are alike . Every human being continues throughout life to change . The question , What is good for the human machine as a going concern ? is , therefore always personal and individual ; it all depends . Some want to go fast , others prefer to go slow . One may see ideal life only in the chest of Hercules ; another , in the wings on // the feet of Mercury . But most humans are born right ; there is nothing the matter with our inheritance . There is a normal rate of growth and of growing old . Too much or too little upsets the normal rate . With nothing to chew on , normal development of jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected . Without work or play , normal development of the bones and muscles of the motor mechanism is not to be expected . " Exercises " and " physical culture " are too often taken as pills and drugs : controls , but not cures . Glued to a chair with head tied to an account book or a last makes for less than the normal work designed by nature for heart and lungs . By and by lungs and heart lose their original capacity for work , as do muscles which are never extended . Man has inherited a body of a certain type which functions best under certain conditions of food , work , rest , sleep , etc . These conditions also are part of each individual 's inheritance and consequently must vary with individuals . Sauce for the goose is not necessarily sauce for the gander . It is true that some Jack Sprats can eat no fat , their wives can eat no lean . The real question , then , for adults , is personal . Is my machine capable of giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ? Many are ready enough to answer , No . But they are not willing to distinguish between hunger and appetite or count calories instead of cost ; and , they will walk a mile for a cigarette , but not a foot for health 's sake . But every child is entitled , in civilization as in savagery to the full development of its normal inheritance . Civilization has taken curious , often monstrous , bents ; and even " now in many places does not hesitate to deny children the . free exercise of their human birthright to develop soun ? minds in sound bodies . // 16 " How can a man be born when he is old ? " asked Nico. demus . And answered his question with another , " Can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb and be born ? " Life does grow old and young again , but nature knows of no such rebirth as puzzled the brain of Nicodemus and has become entangled in the folk-customs of so many peoples . ( . rowing old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child 's words , " merely one aspect of Werden and Vergehen , the Becoming and Passing-away which make up the history of the universe . " What is it that grows old and young again ? " Life " grows Did . What is " life " ? We have certain criteria ? none too good ? for living beings ; and certain criteria for death . But life itself , can it be defined or described ? Is it a thing or action , a process or a function ? There are living beings d processes or functions of living . But life can not be restricted by this or that process or function , nor described this or that chemical compound ; nor as any one certain particular form . Life is something more than process or notion , compound or form . Life is a result of action in something . The " something " u physical body of protoplasm . The " action " is change , many and complex and dynamic . Dynamic changes and physical body are inseparable ; they influence and condition ell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic changes . What disturbs this system disturbs the being ; the Mg is the system . If the disturbance is so great that the rig can not readjust itself , the system breaks down , the Mg dies . Probably we shall never know just how life itself began . we could concoct a reaction-complex capable of living , might not know just when life begins . The complex // structure and the dynamic process known in living beings are always bound by a bond which , broken , ends life . Hence life is unlike any machine made by man . In machines , dynamic processes take place in complex structures , but we can always distinguish between process and structure . Nor can the machine function until the structure is completed . But the living being always functions and has been functioning since life began . The structure determined function , function determined structure . In other words , life constructs its own machine by living . Living means changing . Living processes depend on change . The body during growth adds to itself certain chemical compounds which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a nature that they can be built into the body . The energy used up during the building or growth period is furnished by the oxidation of less stable compounds . The growing child is a rapidly changing being . We age fastest during childhood . The rate of metabolism is then highest . In old age it slows down . In starvation , new compounds are not synthesized as fast as old compounds are broken down . But starvation only ends in death after many weeks because the most vital functions are carried on in the most active organs . Because of their activity they are fed , first by stored fuel or fats , next by muscle . When this fuel is exhausted , death soon follows . Thus , growing and growing-old are simply two aspects of the same complex dynamic activity . Both are phases of production and progress . We shall know how to grow young when we know how to increase the rate of metabolism or vital change , and how to change the cells of the body so that an increase in rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hinges on the interna I. secretions of the sex glands is not part of the problem raise , by Nicodemus . A man " renewing his youth " is one thing . Life growing young again is quite a different thing . Life resides only in living beings ; the way they are bor // again when old is one phase of evolution . The process is called reproduction , of which there are many methods . Have they all something in common ? Or is there some unique quality in reproduction in man and higher animals not found in the lowest animals ? Whether there is or not , the fate of the individual organisms concerned is different . Those that reproduce by division do not die ; at any rate , as Weismann , aid , there is no " corpse . " Death does overtake those that reproduce bisexually . But reproduction in man is bisexual . Man , as individual , dies ; he can not be born again when he is old , or young . The life that is in him can grow young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That i the nature of reproduction . Rebirth , then , as that word is commonly understood , is biologically inconceivable . It is possible that to-day complex chemical substances are in process of becoming of the nature of protoplasm in which living reactions take place , and which , roll Id we observe them , would be recognized as living beings . tut the laws of chance are against it and all our conceptions evolution are against it . A possible " rebirth " is quite as probable . All that is known of the facts of evolution and all theories to the mechanism of evolution favor the idea that every n and every being alive to-day have been alive since life s evolved . It is even more certain that every man and ry organism alive to-day began life as part of an adult or hi " organism . But as man and all organisms begin their ividual existence as young organisms , it follows that tithing , somewhere , somehow , has renewed its youth , has on-e young again . Call this " something " life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that is in man and in all living ngs is old , millions of years old ; it grows young through reduction . There are only two great kinds of reproduction : without or agamic ( no wife ) , and with sex or gametic ( wife ) . // In agamic reproduction , a new individual arises from part or parts of the body which have come to lie beyond the physiologic limit of size ; they are physiologically isolated parts of the body . In gametic reproduction , as in man , the germs of life are also isolated ? so far as the parent individual is concerned , " dead and shed , " Child says . But by adult life they are also already highly specialized and have already completed their growth . Weismann assumed that the germ-cells are young and that they are special only in the sense that they are set aside at once in embryonic development for the purpose of reproduction ; hence the doctrine of the " continuity of the germ. plasm . " He also assumed that nothing could influence these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character acquired by the body of the individual carrying these cells . But germ-cells in bisexual reproduction are in no sense " young " ; they are no more " special " than any other group of cells of the body . aside to become the store of future germ-cells . Ovum and sperm are old cells , especially the sperm . They - are as differentiated as almost any cells of the body . They have ceased to grow ; they have a low rate of metabolism but the dynamic substratum present in both is old protoplas grown old during the long years of evolution . As a res it has become stable , highly individualized . Otherwise the could have been no evolution of such structural permanence . and complexity as we find in man and higher animals . Hence evolution is not chiefly change in form , but than : in the dynamic reaction system of protoplasm . As in , vidual man develops and grows old , so evolution itself repr sents a change from a less stable to a more stable conditi in the dynamic reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a res of that evolution , it has reached such a stage of differentiati. that it can no longer react alone , as it does in lower orgy // isms . Only by marriage of ovum and sperm is the carrier of life brought back to pre-embryonic conditions . Fertilization is the only rejuvenescence known to man and higher animals . By fertilization the old protoplasm of the ovum is reconstituted , reduced , rejuvenated . The fertilized ovum is younger than ovum and sperm were before they united in fertilization . It begins life anew ; and as a parasite . Having escaped from the old individual , it is no longer subject to the inhibitions of the old . Not until it begins its post-natal existence will it be subject to the inhibitions of human society . The fertilized human ovum is possibly less an " individual " than a protozoon , but that ovum is protoplasm which has been evolved to the point that within it is potentially present the foundation of the structure and form of an adult man or woman . That ovum can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials that it can build some into new protoplasm and incorporate the new within its body ; it can Oxidize other food materials to set free the energy it uses in building its body . This transformation of food materials is metabolism , change , the foundation of the function of life . Life itself , then , is change in protoplasm , itself a dynamic entity . Change or reaction is determined by its physicochemical constitution and by its relation to the external world . Adaptations are thus seen as simply special features of this relation . The mechanism by which life renews its youth is such an adaptation . I agree with Child that it is impossible to conceive of evoluand of so-called " adaptations " without assuming that equired characters " can be inherited . But often , as Child jets out , tens of thousands of generations may have been necessary for such inheritance to become appreciable . Without such adaptation there would be no such living beings as man and higher animals . There might be something else " just as good , " for , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man is superior to the ameba ; we // can have no idea what the ameba would think of the proposition . Nor need it necessarily disturb our self-esteem to realize that only our own conditioned human eyes see man as a " finished product " of evolution . Pearl aptly argues that Omnipotence could have made a much better machine than the human body ? " that is , if he had first learned the trick of making a self-regulating and self-reproducing machine . Each part of the human body is only just good enough to get by ? workmanship like that of an average man . If evolution happens to be furnished with fine materials it has no objection to using them , but is equally ready to use shoddy if it will hold together long enough to get the machine by the reproductive period . " Which is another way of saying that evolution 's main concern is the continuation of life rather than of this or that kind of living beings . But this does not necessarily mean that senility and death are the inevitable ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 17 Man and other warm-blooded animals are killed by freezing or by boiling , or by cutting off their air or food supply . Death comes also in other ways : foreign substances are taken in , or get into the body , which can not be eliminated or combated ; or vital parts of the body are injured by mechanical or other means . In other words , we die when the conditions necessary for life have been so changed that life becomes impossible . We are specific mechanisms in which certain physicochemical changes occur in a certain routine order . We live as long as the mechanism is in good repair and the changes take place . Mechanism and changes are one . They onl seem two when life is looked at from different angles . Together , they represent life : they balance ; they are in // equilibrium ; they are adjusted ; they harmonize . Normally they go through life together , always preserving this harmony . Cut off a leg : the blood does not stop circulating ; it readjusts itself to the changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of the machine stops . Anything which necessitates serious readjustment is pathologic . The body is diseased when under conditions to which it is not adjusted . There are almost as many diseases as there are cells in the body ; certainly many more than there are tissues or organs . Disease in any cell , cell-group , tissue , organ , or system , is felt everywhere . The noise of a toothache may be faint by the time it reaches the toe , but the toe is none the less interested . A gallstone may be of particular concern only to the liver , but the liver 's concern is the body 's concern . Life is played to a certain tune ; it need not be a monkeywrench to set its chords jangling . An undigested bean will do , or a bean in the windpipe ; or any one of a thousand things . But despite the nicety of the balances and co-ordinations which make for normal health , the body 's capacity for readjustment is remarkable . It is not we who fight for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in spite of much e do to discourage them . This fighting power is part of our inheritance . We can not prow a new limb , much less a new head or a new trunk , as some animals can . We can store fuel fat as no lower animal can ; and experience , as no other animal can . It is not to be charged to our inheritance if we fill our experience-loft with rubbish . We can make repairs ; in some tissues , very extensive repairs . We can make antibodies . These antibodies illustrate the vast numbers and the enormous complexity of the processes that go on under our in , and the fine adjustments that must always be going on keep the body tuned up for the business of life . Something seems to happen when the body faces civilizat . There is probably not a single adult in this country // with a body in perfect tune : what the life-insurance companies would call " Class AA risk . " Of 1,000 employees examined by one motor company , just 1,000 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 10 per cent had " slight defects , " the other 90 per cent had " defects not so slight . " Nearly 40 per cent of the white school children of Washington have defects ? teeth , vision , hearing , etc. ? which can be located without removing their clothes . Over 45 per cent of Pennsylvania 's youth were not physically fit to be sent overseas to be shot at . This means two things . More get past Cultural Selection than Natural Selection ; the openings in the sieve are larger , the nature of the struggle is different . Runts which grow to Roosevelts and Steinmetzes in civilization die early in nature . Runts which become nothing but charges on society also survive in Cultural Selection . In other words , individuals with inherited or postnatal defects live because society supplies that which their bodies lack to maintain a balance on life . A freak in nature does not live long ; in civilization , it makes good money . Millions of minor defects are due to bad food-digestion . We inherit omnivorous teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food but cooked and predigested . Also , powerful muscles hung to strong bones , leveraged for work . The body was built on the theory that these muscles would be worked . The very work the muscles are supposed to do is part of the process of living . The flow of lymph and the circulation of the blood in general depend on a mechanism built to function best when the motor apparatus is in motion . That is why we have bones and muscles , and that is why we have blood and lymph . One bad tooth in an ancient skull or among savages is an anomaly . A perfect set in an adult American is a far greater anomaly . Toothache means that the cavity is almost in to the nerve . That means almost in to the entire body . Our // body is a double sack , each sealed up tight . Whatever breaks through the wall of either sack ( skin or alimentary canal ) is a foreign body and potential death . Apart from congenital influence , most defects originate in the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gums , bad tooth germs , narrow palate , stunted jaws , adenoid growths , or diseased tonsils . Our inheritance is usually all right ; we do not use it according to directions , The newborn comes with a full set of tools for building a full-grown , sound , healthy , defectless body ; too often it is treated as a cunning little toy to a doting household for six years or so , and is thereafter chiefly of interest to the statistician collecting Defects or Defectives . Metabolism is adjustment for the functions of life . We inherit an adjustment machinery adapted for a certain kind of active life , but before it is of age we have taught it a " civilization " that was never contemplated by the designer of the machine . Civilization is kept busy keeping the machine in repair . One good defect deserves another . Defects lead to other defects . Many bodies are kept so busy repairing leaks in the lungs , or picking cinders out of the fuel , or keeping foreigners out of the blood , that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owner a lifelong joy-ride. 18 Weismann held that death is an " advantageous adaptation . " For what ? To whom ? Looks like nonsense . Osier mid that man is as old as his arteries . There was enough both in this to make it take . It means even less to say that man is as old as his endocrine glands . Arteries and glands are as old as the man . Metchnikoff held that because of " disharmonies " in the body , the phagocytes devoted too much time to eating pigment hair and too little to the bacterial flora of our digestive // tract . Result : fermentation , poison , death . His theory beat the gland-treatment theory into the drug stores , but sour milk is losing ground as a cure for old age . Puberty is a period , but a kind of sex life begins at birth ; for many , real sexual maturity never comes . So it is with adults ; some are more adult in body and mind at fifteen than others at thirty-five ; some hurry through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal old age is physiological ; it is no more a disease than adolescence , and should be as agreeable . In pathologic old age , senility is premature and is a disease . The seat of the disease may be anywhere or may be due to bacterial infection . In natural death , we die by inches . But while there is only one path by which we may enter the world , as Pearl points out in his remarkable book on Death , there are many that lead to the River Styx . Death does not strike at random , but in an orderly way ; and there are many ways of dying . We die when an essential part of our body breaks down . From an analysis of the mortality tables of England and Wales , the United States , and Sao Paulo , Brazil , Pearl found that over half the deaths in all three countries are due to faulty wind and food canals . While both canals are inside the body , they come in contact with air , food , and water from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is armorplate against foreign invasion . Wind and food canals have no such protecting layer of pavement cells as has th e skin . Outer skin and lining of wind and food canals con stitute the body 's first line of defense against invasion o bacteria . The next chief cause of death is the circulatory system ; the blood is the body 's second line of defense . When th. first fails to check the enemy , the way to the blood is open . Hence the great part played by the circulatory system as the second great cause of death . As Pearl says , we should live much longer if our lungs were as good as our heart . The death rates show certain important age and sex fluctu // at ions . Early infancy deaths are heavy . There is then a . sharp drop until the 10-15-year period , when the rate begins to rise to the 20-25-year period . Thereafter the rate rises lowly until the 50-55-year period , when it begins to rise gain rapidly . The death rate from failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , when it ows down . But between the fifth and thirty-fifth years this to is higher in females than in males , presumably because changes accompanying puberty are graver . Up to the ty-fifth year deaths from breakdown of the sex apparatus e also much greater in females . The chief cause of death among males during the first year from the food canal ; after that , to the sixtieth year , the piratory system ; after the sixtieth year , the circulatory system . Nearly 60 per cent of the deaths were from organs derived n the endoderm or inner germ-layer ? the layer that originally was outside the body . In the developing embryo that layer comes to be folded within the body and lines the food canal and accessory organs of digestion . It is an old-fashioned , out-of-date relic of antediluvian ectoderm . As a lining r the food canal it is our weakest spot . Our strongest spots are the skin cover of our body and our vous system . Both are derived from the ectoderm or ter germ-layer . Deaths from structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the total . Almost germs get through a healthy skin . The cells of skin and es have differentiated most from their primitive structure . The remaining 30 per cent of deaths are from the mesoor middle germ-layer , circulatory and urogenital ems and muscles . The breakdown of the female reproductiveetive organs is also a heavy factor in infant mortality . While mortality due to breakdown in ectoderm organs is t the same for the two sexes , female mortality from // mesoderm is as great as from endoderm breakdown twenty years before it is in males . Death comes , then , according to Pearl , because our bodies are made up of systems specialized in structure and function . In becoming specialized , their cells have become so differentiated that they have lost the power of indefinite and independent existence . Thus the cells lining our lungs can be nourished only if the cells of the food tract and the blood keep on the job . Some systems are better made than others . The brain outwears the heart , the heart outwears the lungs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl finds in such dissimilar countries as England , the United States , and Sao Paulo , force him to conclude that innate constitutional factors , along with environmental factors , largely determine rates of human mortality . In certain diseases , of course , environment is the important factor . The causes of death , Pearl finds , are in the following descending order : respiratory system ; digestive system ; circulatory system and blood ; nervous system and sense organs ; kidneys and related excretory organs ; sex organs ; skeletal and muscular system ; skin ; endocrine organs . Or , arranged proportionately according to embryonic germ-layer origin : endoderm diseases 5.2 and mesoderm diseases 3.8 times those of ectoderm origin . We may be as old as our arteries ? and so no good for digging a sewer ; but we are also as young as our brains ? and so , good where brains are needed . But when any vital . system breaks down , the machine stops and we are dead . 19 Medical authorities believe they could add thirteen years to life if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented . A better life insurance is to pick parents who will live to be eighty ; they will give you a twenty-year 254 ' 1'I1E ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND THE CAUSES OF DEATH better hope of longevity than parents who will die under sixty . They are the best life insurance . Why not ? Each group of animals has its normal span of life . Also man . Human beings vary ; most of their specific characters are inherited . Longevity is a specific character , longevity also is inherited . Those who live to great age as a rule are children of parents who lived to great age . If one can not choose both parents who will live to old age , it is better to choose a longlived father than a long-lived mother . Four per cent more children lived to be eighty where the father , but not the mother , lived to be eighty , than where the opposite condition prevailed . Karl Pearson concluded from a study of the life span of brothers that environment is not the important factor in ongevity ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at birth by inheritance factors . This confusion has never been advertised by health resorts or elixir a manufacturers . Death rates and life spans are but two phases of the probem of longevity . If environment ? including health resorts , elixirs , poverty , and bacteria ? is not the factor in death fates , it can not be the factor in the life span . From one-half to three-fourths of the death rate is selection : death comes when one has used up one 's inherited capacity for life . Adults of sound body are more likely to leave offspring than those of weak ; their children are more likely to survive . Weaklings may survive to maturity , their children are less likely to survive . Hence the high infant death rate in the first two years ; the unfit are weeded out . Natural Selection is still at work ; it has always been at work . This rate is especially high among children of unsound parents . Hygiene and prevention lower the rate during these two dangerous years ? prolonging lives to succumb at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as old as a man of ninety // years . Twenty-four hours after emerging from the pupa stage , the female fly lays eggs . These in one day become larvae , pups three days later , adults five days later ; ten days to a generation . Pearl tested the life-span inheritance theory on these flies . More females than males survived ? as in man . The only fly that lived to be eighty-one days old was a female . Long-lived parents bred offspring that lived long . Pearson was right : duration of life is an inherited character . How about germs of diphtheria , tuberculosis , etc. ? Loeb tested this on flies , with the surprising result that those kept free from bacteria were possibly shorter-lived than germ ? laden flies , certainly no longer . The experiments indicated " that higher organisms must die from internal causes even if all chances of infection and all accidents are excluded . " We are never without bacteria ; we could not live without them ; there is no habitable spot on earth free of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent have been infected at one time or another with the bacillus of tuberculosis ; in less than one in ten does it become active . Death rates in the poverty lanes of Paris and London do not tally . In Paris the excess death rate in the poorest as against the richest quarter is 104 per cent ; in London , only 30 . The lowest death rate in London is not in the riches quarter . The real influence of poverty on death rates could only be determined by transposing the inhabitants of the two . groups and comparing rates . The " poor " of Paris an . London are not necessarily biologically poor . It is the pace that kills . " General Sherman , " the gian redwood , was killed at the age of 2,171 years . He was seedling in 271 B. C. He never knew what hurry meant Nor did the tortoise that lived 350 years . The faster w - live , the sooner we live life up . Rate of living is a facto. in longevity . Slonacker tested this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them race . The average life span o the marathoners was 29.5 months ; one lived thirty-fou months and ran 5,447 miles . Three other rats were reared // in squirrel cages , but were not permitted to race ; their average span was 48.3 months . Loeb tried flies . Cold makes flies sluggish ; those at cold temperature lived longer than those at high . At 86 degrees , his flies lived 21 days ; at 68 degrees , 54 days ; at 60 degrees , 124 days . From which he inferred that if we could keep our blood temperature at about 45 degrees , we might hope to live about 1,900 years . But life would be at a low level ! Unfortunately , our early ancestors left no trustworthy vital tistics . But from trustworthy inferential data there is anon to believe , as we might expect on purely biologic ounds , that longevity is on the increase . At least , life expectancy has improved during the last 2,000 years . Of 100 Romans born in Egypt in the days of the Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English alive at 0 , 39 live to be 68 . Women especially had less expectancy f life in Roman days than now ? they were in luck to be live at 25 . But a Roman of 78 years was a better risk than American of the same age ; a Roman had to be very hardy live beyond 70 . In America , many weaklings are carried to 60 ; beyond that age their expectancy rapidly diminishes . From which we conclude that modern environment is ter for man , or that man is fitter for modern environment . 20 Life goes on : only individuals ( lie . Some individuals apparently are also endowed with immortality ? such are the otozoa or one-cell organisms . Nearly all Metazoa or any-cell organisms die ? their endowment is mortal . Man also is a Metazoon . All men die . Must they die ? until recently this would have been a foolish question . It can not yet be answered , but experiments now going on for twenty-five years give us food for thought . Since boys have been boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not die until the sun goes down . For ages it has been well known that many animals have the power to grow certain missing parts . A fish-worm cut in two grows into two worms ? the head grows a tail , the tail a head . Cut a crab 's eye from its stack , it grows another eye just as good . Cut a leg from a crayfish , it grows another leg . Cut a finger off the human hand ; no finger grows on . But our hair keeps on growing ; it may grow even after the last heartbeat . Cut a nerve fiber of a finger ; the fiber " dies " from the point where cut to the end of the finger and so paralyzes that end of the finger . But the live end begins to grow again and finally reaches the end of the finger . Even though the finger had been mangled , the nerve finds its way , if it has to go around bone and muscle . At the end of its journey it stops growing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loeb informed the world that he was growing frog nerve in a glass jar . Biologists began to grow pieces of tissue from other animals in glass jars . Wilson chopped up a sponge and squeezed the pieces through close-woven cloth to separate its cells . He " cultivated " one cell ; it grew into a whole sponge . Carrel cultivates all sorts of adult tissue in glass jars ; even cancer cells . He has cancer cells that have outlived several hosts . He cut a piece from the embryo of a chick ; after nine years it was still alive and growing . He cut muscle cells from a chick embryo 's heart ; they grow and beat . That opened the coffin again . Tissues cut from living . bodies , it was thought , should not grow , they should die ! They are not germ-cells , they are only body or soma-cells . Soma cells were not supposed to be endowed with immor . tality . Yet under cultivation they live , they multiply , they grow . In a jar . Soma cells also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is our saliva full of dead cells and the skin of our body covered with dead cells ? Why is the body that was living now dead ? 258 7 ' I'IIE ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND THE CAUSES OF DEATH What is death ? No one yet knows . No one knows what fife is . We only know the living from the dead . We know more about the causes of death than we did . But are we checking disease , postponing death ? Can we renew our outh ? Are we about to make death merely an accident ? n we synthesize life ? Man by nature is not too modest , or by training without hope or the habit of stretching his magination . Our answer , then , is , " Yes , why not ? " And pleasant time is had by all . Molasses catches more flies a n vinegar . Such important functions of our body as heartbeat , breathing , digestion , and absorption are beyond the control of our ills ; they have their own centers or systems of control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and systems f control are located . When we know just what takes place when a sweet becomes sour , or how a cell converts sugar into glycogen , or why heart beats in a certain solution and stops dead if the cidity of that solution is increased by one billionth part , we an begin to talk about prolonging life . Not one single process that goes on in any one cell of our body has yet been completely analyzed . When some of the rocesses of life have been even fairly well analyzed , it will e possible to speak of the artificial synthesis of life . Nevertheless , there is every reason to believe that we may look forward to a greatly increased control over evolutionary processes . Why not ? Think of the already enormously increased ability to control growth in living organisms . This control has only come with an understanding of the nature of the stuff of organisms in which energy is transformed , and of the relation of organisms to the external world . With wider understanding will come wider control . But progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we deal with internal conditions which are the result of millions of years of alternating change . It is all so new . There are to-day a half-dozen flourishing // sciences devoted to the study of life where a few years ago there was not one . For the first time in human history man has trained his new-found instruments of precision on newly conceived problems . He can at last ask questions about himself and about life in general . Direct questioning has replaced vague and childish speculation . Problems have been formulated and solved . And every problem solved has opened wider vistas ? and more problems . But no problem was ever solved by propaganda . Nor is disease checked by mere optimism ? though digestion can be checked by a bill collector and a mouse 's heartbeat increased from 175 to 600 per minute by a mouse trap . The death rate is declining ; it has been declining for centuries . Men born to-day can expect longer life than me born twenty , fifty , five hundred , or five thousand years ago Why this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline i s death rate in modern times is as true of " backward " countries as it is of Germany , England , the United States . The dro is also as true of the non-preventable diseases as of thos which are supposed to be subject to control . The part that health officers , etc. , play in this decline uncertain . War has been increasingly waged against tube . culosis for nearly a century ; the tuberculosis rate has droppless than that for diphtheria , croup , typhoid , and dysenter The cause of many diseases is yet unknown , of others only partially surmised . Man responds to his environment , a does all life ; but he is changing his environment , in places an extraordinarily rapid rate . What is the result or wh : will be the result of these changes is not yet known , nor can be predicted with any degree of certainty . We hand public health , as we do government , over to power which we expect thereafter to run of its own actor ' But neither ever gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry . Meanwhile , for every one that knows what to e : and why , there are a hundred who eat for their tongue 's sake and let it go at that , not knowing that a double chin may 260
