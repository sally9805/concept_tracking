The Shenandoah Valley , where snow fell last fortnight , was bright last week with drifts of apple blossoms . Governor Harry Flood Byrd , himself a big cider , applesauce and vinegar producer , flew by blimp from Richmond to Winchester to crown the queen of the valley 's blossom festival , Miss Mary Wise Boxley of Roanoke . It was a lyric occasion . Visitors waxed ecstatic over the scenery , the verdure , the marching schoolchildren . Newsgatherers tasted real Virginia applejack . None had a more gladsome time than his suave and swarthy excellency , Mahmoud Samy Pasha , Egyptian Minister to the U. S. , who , with Mme. Samy , had been warmly persuaded to attend . His Excellency enjoyed himself , at least , until Mrs. Francis M. Reynolds , a member of the ceremonial committee , spying the portly dark-complected Samy Pasha in his place of honor on a school-house porch , requested him to depart . She did not " want him around , " said Mrs. Reynolds . Insulted , Samy Pasha and his party returned to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Reynolds ' stupid race-blindness did Samy Pasha shrug his smooth shoulders and say , good-naturedly : " It 's all right . We forget it . "
