WITH the Opera season ap . proaching , it becomes clear that a number of people are urging the Metropolitan managers to patronize more American composers than they have hitherto done . It is a worthy movement  --  that is , if suitable operas and suitable people willing to pay high prices for American opera seats can be found . It is not worthy if these two essentials are lacking ; for every time an American opera is pronounced a failure at the Metropolitan , the entire company of native composer 's receives an ugly blow . We , for one , do n't blame GattiCasazza for balking . He has had too many American operas fail . For what is the Metropolitan ? It is an enormous building ideally suited to German opera with its Gods and Heroes , a little less suited to Italian opera , and not suited at all to French Opera . The modern trend in music is to something less bombastic by far . And if American money desires American opera , our suggestion is a smaller opera house .

And we notice that dresses this year are so short as to make the gesture of covering the knee obviously insincere . It is only good psychology that just so soon as the knee is shown intentionally it will be made as beautiful as possible . This means covering it with a stocking .

" This musical troupe , it will be remembered , was composed of fourteen picked artists , each one a concert soloist on his instrument . Returning from Texas , Mr. Barrere found that his booking bureau had arranged a concert in Ephrata , Pennsylvania . Here , on the evening of the concert , the manager of the opera house sought out the manager of the " Little Symphony . " He did not know what was the custom , the local manager explained ; so would he have the curtain raised first and let the troupe come on , or would the troupe be seated and then have the curtain raised ? The novelty of not having to troop cut before the audience appealed to the fourteen soloists ; they decided that being seated on the stage before the curtain went up would be a welcome change . It was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nod from Mr. Barrere . " Let her go , boys , " he called , and the stage hands leant on the ropes . Slowly the curtain rose , to disclose the fourteen musicians to their audience . And , as the footlights came into view of the waiting soloists , the local five-man orchestra , in the pit , broke lustily , if somewhat tinnily , into an overture " If you knew Susie , like I know Susie ? " For Posterity THE Hall of Fame , sombre and still in its stone dignity on University Heights , is not given to tremulous excitement . Hardly a sniff it gave , for example , to Mayor Hylan 's late proposals to build a garbage incinerator one hundred and fifty feet under its uptilted nose . Yet to-day , who can grudge the unblinking colonnade a quiver of anticipation ? The quinquennial election is over ; only the final approval of the august Senate of New York University stands between an avid public and the announcement of names chosen when the balloting of one hundred and seven gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deeper is the interest this year , because the electors have fallen behind their quota of five nominees every five years and this time may choose as many as twelve names , filling seven vacancies which the last twenty-five years have seen accumulate . THERE is appropriate solemnity in the choice of immortals . Twenty-five years , they must be dead . Slowly the machinery of decision grinds for posterity , hemming itself in with safeguards lest it give way to rash enthusiasm , cringing behind minor mysteries of its own contriving . The present wait for approval is a final precaution , taken to filter the more carefully . Until the last moment there is always the grim danger of some unexpected blotch appearing to blacken the name of an elect , Dr. Robert Underwood Johnson , the present director of the Hall of Fame , impresses one as a fitting figure to conduct an election to immortality , " with dignity , restraint , breadth of view and a sense of proportion and value , " as the handbook of his editing explains . " We are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight of our choosing . Most obvious candidates have been elected ; the electors are voting upon those on the borderline . " Many who are alive to-day , he will add , will have niches ; perhaps that is why the quota is not now filled . Edison , perhaps ; Wilson , when twenty-four years more have elapsed . There is also Roosevelt . Electors ( Dr. Johnson , of course , is not one will-ing . Who can tell twenty-five years from now . P. T. Barnum , Charles Spencer Chaplin , of course , no .

Travel Note VOYAGERS to and fro on the Berengaria will be served the following anecdote for some time , since it came to being only the last time the liner docked here . Two gentlemen , although unacquainted , were forced by the exigencies of travel to share a cabin for the sail back from Europe . One of the pair , a gruff , self-contained person , resisted the early efforts of his cabin mate to establish a reasonably cordial entente . So , after the first day out , they spoke to each other not at all . While the Berengaria was steaming up the Narrows , the gruff , self-contained one broke the week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His cabin mate said he did n't . " Sure you do n't ?

HARDLY a season that we have not some Hamlet with us , but this is a Fall when only the hardiest productions may survive and we are to have no fewer than two . In the intensity of competition it is perhaps as well for the melancholy Dane that he has had a Hampden and a Barrymore to break the ice of blase t925 audiences for him . And it is proba ble that the Hamlet in modern clothing , which is to follow , relies in part for its success on the interest aroused by this earlier opening . New York 's edition of a Hamlet in up to date raiment has already progressed beyond the rumors its creation first circulated . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basil Sydney and with a sixteen-year-old aphelia , Miss Helen Chanel/cr . It is in rehearsal , promised for the first week in November . The London production is well into its third month , and its local producers are taking the experiment very seriously indeed . They have not overlooked the potential publicity which lurks in curiosity about their treatment of stage direction in following Shakespeare 's text . Shall foils for the duel be snatched from the walls , as in the British performance ? how now is Poionizes to be murdered ? shall a Twentieth Century ghost materialize ? shall Queen Gertrude ( Adrienne Morrison ) have bobbed hair  --  boyish bob or Eton cut ? In the whetting of such interest , the performance is laid bare to the growing of accusation of being " tricky , " but in the end this may be only a further means of preCATS Of CHINATOWN serving , in the struggle for existence , an able performance . I the meantime we hear that Miss 1 Barrymore and Mr. Hampden are so satisfied with their combination that it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps also for a play based on Browning 's " The Ring and the Book . " The old Colonial Theatre , to which Mr. Hampden has courteously given his name , again makes history , this time in the northward trend of the theatre . Over a score of years ago it was Percy Williams 's ace house ; then it was bought by Keith and waxed supreme in vaudeville until the Palace to the South and the Eighty-first Street Theatre to the North stilled its thunder . The local population , on which an average vaudeville house depends for its main support , moved away and left it , an oasis among garages , and an oasis overrun by Don Juan hill towards the Hudson . Then there grew and flourished New York 's nearest approach to the epithet and penny throwing galleries of old England . Without designs on art , frankly admitting its plebian taste , the Colonial 's was the gallery which had the distinction of booing from its stage the great Yvette Guilbert , then , ten years ago , at the height of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's performance , but a displeasure as nothing to that of the actress herself . In towering rage , she stepped out of her part , snapped words of vitriol back into her critics ' teeth , and with the stroke set herself up in their eyes as a near idol . A cheerful populace , happy to be beaten at its own game . At its heyday the Colonial was the Mecca of West Side youngsters . Not to go to its Monday matinee meant ostracism . As such , its place was never filled when it succumbed at last , and it was the success of the darktown productions , riding the current vogue , which brought it back into the electric glare . Now again it is to rise to further glory , still the property of the Keith organization , but flaunting the banner of Hampden , the ghosts of its once shrill gallery silenced before a Barry-more as OpItelia . Reunion ONE is apt to encounter more in the Brevoort these evenings than the mere savory French cooking , or the impedimenta of American building construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was astonished to see prowling about the disordered lobby Mr. Dudley Field Malone , Mr. Clarence Darrow , Mr. Arthur Garfield Hays , and sundry newspaper correspOndents . But it was n't , after all , a dire and portentous occasion . It was a mere reunion , in the best collegiate style , of the Grenadiers of Dayton , Tennessee . Forty correspondents for newspapers along the more civilized segments of the Atlantic seaboard were gathered as dinner guests of the distinguished counsel for the defense in the Scopes trial . They dined , and thereafter disported themselves  --  how do you suppose ? In a mock trial . And who would you guess was the defendant ? None other than Mr. Henry L. Mencken , the sworn enemy of the Rotarian . A good time , it is said , was had by all . Chaplin I NDULGING in that careless dalli- ance but rarely seen in men of large affairs , Mr. Charles Chaplin has lingered amongst us , putting off from day to day his departure for the Canadian woods where he has promised himself that thrilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he sallies forth from his seclusion at the Ritz , he still whets his humor with whimsical adventures of the sort made fabulous by a memorable Caliph of Bagdad . The lower East Side , for example , is an unfailing lure to him . And whenever his boredom becomes heavy , he wanders , with memories of 0 . Henry , along the crowded lanes which " C'm on , dearie ! Fifteen minutes a day is all y ' need " sprout from Delancey Street . Recently , while on such an excursion , he sauntered to the outskirts of a group of urchins gathered about a windy corner , and peered through to End the cause of their hilarity . They were cheering lustily , he discovered , a particularly impish gamin who , with a battered derby and a rat-tail cane was imitating the Pilgrim himself . " Ho ! " said Mr. Chaplin , chuckling a moment or two over the lad 's antics . Then , bursting through and snatching up the cane and hat , " Just a moment , boys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a second or two , the throng stood spellbound while the dapper stranger shuffled through the familiar walk . Then the original performer came sadly forward for the return of his properties . " Sorry , Mister , " he consoled , " you 'd he all right , but you just ai n't got the feet for it . " ON the other hand , ignorance of the comedian 's identity is not wholly confined to the citizens of low estate . It was at the Meadow Brook Club , during the polo , that Chaplin 's next adventure in obscurity is recorded . For quite a time , Mr. Chaplin threaded his way among the gay and blooded throng , forced to be content with a hesitating and palpably uncomprehending nod from here and there . It was , indeed , one of his dull afternoons , until he wandered into the cloak room . The attendant there , it seems , knew his movie stars better than did his betters , and was amiable in his greeting . Quickly , it was discovered that both had originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many memories to revive on both sides . Enter , then , an international banker of vast financial sinew and precious little personal fame . He heard them say Brixton , and joined at once in the talk . He , too , it fell out , was a native of that sterling township . For half an hour old tales were bandied back and forth , with wistful glee . But it was not until half an hour later , when the banker was led unwillingly from his new and jolly friends , that a fellow club member whispered to him the identity of the little chap with the glittering eyes and faint French accent . Skeptic IF , and whenever , in future discourse the question should arise : who is the greatest skeptic in town ? the answer is , Mr. Morris Albert Kalpin , driver of an Independent taxicab . Mr. Kalpin 's taxicab , containing fare , was proceeding , with reasonable alacrity , along Sixth Avenue . Ahead , as he neared Thirty-eighth Street , was one of Mr. Du Pont 's alarming wagons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , " Explosives . " In the course of his professional duties and also of his amazing curiosity , Mr. Kalpin directed his taxicab so that a collision ensued . Perhaps it was unavoidable ; perhaps not . Mr. Kalpin 's fare can not recall having given any thought to this phase of the incident at the moment of the crash . Nothing - more explosive than language ensued , however ; and when the shouting and tumult died , Mr. Kalpin turned with a serene smile to observe : " I allus thought them darn wagons wuz duds ! " Siege AL THOUGH the vast army of realtors , after its long siege of lower Park Avenue , now holds many strategic positions along the battle front , the invaders are far from victory . The brave defense of Murray Hill still continues , despite the constant attacks of operators and builders whose object is a thoroughfare similar to the walled-in highway beyond Grand Central . On the southeast corner of Thirty-fourth Street , Mrs. Robert Bacon holds a citadel comprising her own house and three brownstone fronts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Parl  --  Avenue Corporation was formed , there was a rumor that she had sold out to the barbarians . Her reply was that she intended to spend the rest of her life in the chalet opposite the armory , and her neighboring allies were equally obdurate . Farther north , the forts of the old regime still resist the onslaughts of the apartment contractors . Miss Bowdoin 's dignified corner at Thirty-sixth Street is as safe as the Tuileries , and Arthur Curtiss James 's Alhambra at Thirty-eighth is another stronghold of the beleaguered garrison . Drills rattle against steel girders , and the dust of commerce rises from the torn field ; but the gallant old guard will not yield to the montanic cliffs now wedged between the castles of New York 's golden age . Education MR . FRANK A. MUNSEY , despite his reputation for the New England soul , is generous in his treatment of those employees who come into intimate contact with him . To the elders of his publishing houses , he is giving now a year 's vacation , in order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines , is enjoying that leisure these months . Mr. Frank O'Brien , who won a Pulitzer prize for his editorial on the Unknown Soldier , is next on the list . This new policy of a twelve-month holiday , when it was announced by Mr. Munsey , drew from one of his editorial council approving comment , " The Sabbatical year is a godsend in modern times . " " Sabbatical year , " murmured Mr. Munsey , in the throes of mnemonics . " Sabbatical year . " At the next council following , Mr. Munsey rose to make announcement . " I 've looked up this Sabbatical year , gentlemen , " said the publisher , gravely , " and I 'm in favor of it . " Artiste MR . E. RAY GOETZ is the hap-piest of immortals these days , for he has beaten the ubiquitous Mr. Morris Gest at his own game of importations . The unique and extraordinary Racquel Meller will venture across the Atlantic and will appear under the direction of Mr. Goetz , with the shadow of Mr. A. L. Erlanger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say . Once before the gay singer almost visited us . She was under contract to Mr. Charles Cochran of London , and Mr. Arch Selwyn had obtained an option on her services , but the English manager 's financial difficulties released her from all agreements . Mile . Meller will appear at special matinees , it is believed , four a week , for which she is to receive fifteen hundred dollars a performance . Even this sum can not be what influenced her to come here . To the Continental artiste , a triumph in New York means nothing . It is as slight a matter to her as would be an Argentinian debut to Miss Ethel Barrymore . It was only when she had disputes with her manager , or some similar quarrel ? or , again , when her Parisian public was showing the indifference of familiarity  --  that the Bernhardt used to visit us . Mlle. Meller  --  although she is Spanish and sings only in that tongue ? is likewise indifferent to the money involved . She is working on a moving picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two million francs . Perhaps the explanation is that , as others did before her , Mlle. Meller is putting her Continental public to the old treatment of absence as a cure for disenchantment . Whatever the reason , the town will flock to hear her , particularly if her repertoire includes " During the Procession , " for singing which she was threatened with excommunication until she personally appeared before His Holiness the Pope . And of course we shall see her in her role of flower seller . Reform IT is hereby suggested , on the basis of a recent experience , that an economic reform be effected by agreement among non-Volsteadians to take their gin in unlabelled bottles . My bootlegger informs me that he could afford to cut prices materially were it not for the cost of counterfeit labels and bottles made in imitation of the better known containers . He volunteered this information when I wanted the ingredients of a cocktail too urgently to wait for delivery and so called at his office . " What brand do you want ? " inquired my bootlegger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter , " said L " If everyone was like you I could sell this stuff for one-quarter less , " he informed me . " These counterfeit labels cost me ninety dollars for five thousand , and then there 's the cost of the corks , the caps , the bottles . That 's what makes liquor expensive . "
