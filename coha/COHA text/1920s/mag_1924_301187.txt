As a preliminary to the forthcoming International Exhibition at Pittsburgh , Paul Albert Besnard , who is to serve on the jury there , is holding exhibitions of paintings at Knoedler 's , and etchings at Keppel 's both in Manhattan . Besnard , little known to Americans , is considered by many to be the Dean of French painters . In 1890 he seceded from the Socit National des Beaux-Arts-from the Socit des Artistes Franais ; thus he was considered a radical , although he was carefully trained in technique . Besnard is President of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts , and Director of the Ecole Franaise in Rome . He has decorated many important Parisian buildings , notably the Hotel de Ville and the Thtre Franaise . His activities cover also portraiture , and life in France and India . Doubtless , the best of Besnard 's work is being saved for the Pittsburgh show , but the present exhibitions are proof of his right to fame . Such canvasses as Sous des Saules ( two women robing under willows ) and Le Bain Romain show versatility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
