An elderly and sweetly commanding lady appeared , last week in the Zoological Gardens at Bristol , where a Conservative party picnic was being held . When reporters crowded round , the lady pinked with amiability . " I was wondering as I entered the Zoo , " she said , " in what category I really belong . I am too old to play with the monkeys or quack with the ducks . I do not want to be enrolled among the geese , and still less among the boars . I wonder where I belong . " <P> " Mrs. Baldwin , " said a punctilious newsgatherer , " would you favor us with an opinion on some political subject . " <P> Soon obliging Mrs. Stanley Baldwin , beloved and industriously charitable wife of the Prime Minister , produced a broadly political and deeply feminine opinion : " A woman Labor leader at Bournemouth declared , the other day , that the Socialist party is out for power . I fancy that we Conservative women want something which is higher than power . We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a party that preaches power and warfare . " <P> Socialists failed to comprehend Mrs. Baldwin . They know , as everyone knows , that the Conservative party is historically belligerent and imperialist , while the Socialist or Labor party is pacifist.
