The diplomatic conversations ( in Tokyo ) between Toshihiko Kawakami , delegate of the Japanese Government , and Adolf A. Joffe , Soviet Envoy from Moscow , for the recognition of the Russian Union of Socialist Soviet Republics by Japan , are not proceeding without a good deal of difficulty . <P> The parleys are taking place in the bedroom of Joffe , who is sick . He remarked : " The only reason I do n't walk out is that I can not walk . " <P> A spokesman for Joffe said : " The only difference ( between the present conference and the recent futile Russo-Japanese conference at Chang-chung ) is that the Japanese seem to be more sincere in their effort to reach an agreement . " <P> The main difficulty at present is over the Japanese insistence on an indemnity for the murder of Japanese at Nikolaievsk in Russia , which they desire to be considered conjointly with the Soviet demand for Japanese evacuation of the Northern part of the island of Sakhalin .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
