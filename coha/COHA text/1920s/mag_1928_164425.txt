On Feb. 28 , it was so hot in Bulawayo ( South Eastern Africa ) that the monkeys were sitting almost motionless on the lower branches of the trees . The air was as thick as chicken gumbo . Suddenly , the animals and the natives were disturbed by a noise like nothing they had ever heard before . An airplane shot down from the sky and came to an abrupt stop in the tangled grasses of a clearing near the village . A woman stepped out unsteadily and fainted . Two natives picked her up and carried her into Bulawayo , where they gave her some sour milk . She developed a fever , and said her name was Lady Heath . That did not mean much to the natives , who wondered what business a lady could have between the tip of South Africa and the equator in an airplane painted turquoise blue . Nearly a month later , the fever left her and she left Bulawayo , flying North . <P> Behind the flight of Lady Sophie Heath there was jealousy and good British gold-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Her new husband , Sir James Heath , is 76 . She is pretty and 30 and got for her wedding present from him a turquoise blue plane to match her favorite stone . <P> The day before their marriage , last October , she had taken the plane up above London to establish an altitude record of 19,000 feet . A few weeks later , she had kissed Sir James goodbye , embarked for Cape Town , South Africa , whence she quickly began to fly across all Africa toward London . If she succeeded , a new female flight record would be hers , but a rival , an " other woman " loomed . <P> The other woman was Lady Mary Bailey . She , too , was an aviatrix and the not quite so young wife ( 38 ) of a richer but not quite so old baronet , Sir Abe Bailey , 63 . The gold of Sir Abe came from diamond mines and from other oldtime South African transactions which gained for him the dubious title of " one of Cecil Rhodes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and he had supplied a town house in London , a country place in Suffolk , a 200,000-acre ranch in Rhodesia , and plenty of airplanes . <P> No sooner did Lady Mary hear that Lady Sophie had recovered from the fever , and was really about to resume the Cape Town-London flight , than she called for her latest and staunchest Moth , and hopped over the British channel . But she had no wish to flaunt a rivalry . Therefore , since her diamond-mining husband , Sir Abe , happened to be in South Africa , she announced that she was taking the most leisurely trip to visit him and that quite incidentally she would be the first woman to fly the London-Cape Town wastes .
