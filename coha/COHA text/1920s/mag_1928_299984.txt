Flip ! The first service was spun . Into action sprang Helen Wills and Mrs. J. Saunders Taylor in the 41st annual women 's championship tournament at Forest Hills , L. I. Twenty-two minutes later they shook hands , Miss Wills a 6-0 , 6-1 victor over Mrs. Taylor . <P> John Van Ryn spent the spring at Princeton because it was his senior year ; George M. Lott went abroad on the Davis Cup squad , played tennis . Yet Van Ryn extended Lott to five sets last week before Lott turned Van Ryn into a pillar of fault , ran out the match , won his first leg on the Newport ( R. I. ) Casino singles cup . The same afternoon Lott , paired with John ( California ) Doeg , bested Van Ryn and Wilmer ( Texas ) Allison in the doubles final . Lott may play freshman tennis next spring at Brown University , which last week admitted him to its rolls . <P> Two great racqueteers have alienated public favor when it might have done them the most good . One was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup defender , whose attempt to justify his turning professional brought forth lame excuses , and turned away many who otherwise might have given him their support . The other was William Tatem Tilden II , who last week was found guilty of breaking the player-writer rule of the U. S. L. T. A. and punished by indefinite banishment from amateur tennis . <P> Just prior to a meeting of tennis moguls in the Hotel Vanderbilt , Manhattan , Tilden made two mistakes : 1 ) He told the tycoons that business prevented his defending his case , which inevitably was inferred to be a plea of guilty ; and 2 ) he released for publication a letter which he wrote to President Samuel H. Collom , of the U. S. L. T. A. , wherein he said , among other things , that he " did not intentionally violate or attempt to evade the spirit or letter of the player-writer rule and to the best of my knowledge articles under dispute do not violate the rule . " This constitutes either falsehood or an anaemic revival of his 1925 alibi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar offense . <P> The standing of Tilden would seem to be : he is out of tennis , knows it ; he may seek reinstatement , but an application for reinstatement would be taken by many to be merely a gesture which would give the U. S. L. T. A. the choice of reversing its stand or of remaining adamant , thus making Tilden appear a martyr . Yet it is unlikely that Tilden cares either way : there are thousands to be made in professional tennis , not a little to be made in exploiting his reputation . Thus , without honor , passes the man who for six years dominated world tennis , who for eight years wielded a sceptral " bat " over the American net game .
