PAUSING in the midst of the morning mail , when an invitation to speak at a book-fair , letters from publishers in praise of their new novels , and a note from a young lady seeking counsel in the business of authorship arc to be found with more urgent communications , the transplanted Englishman finds himself reflecting once again upon the peculiar problem of the expatriate . He is aware of a special duty towards the land of his adoption . He has to cultivate a reasonably agreeable attitude towards American institutions without losing , any more than he can help , that first sharp freshness of observation which gives value to the criticisms of the newcomer and the transient . Unfortunately such a combination of virtues is not easy , and they seem often to be mutually exclusive . The process of acclimating the mind dulls it to the essential peculiarities of the new surroundings . This may account for the failure of the philosophers of our day to comment upon one very remarkable characteristic of modern American life . I allude to the practice of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mail , in the profession of novel and story writing . This , however , is only the visible result of a fundamental and exclusively American attitude towards the young idea in Literature . Readers of Kipling 's Stalky and Co. will remember the schoolboy author who was good-humoredly cuffed and derided by all the schoolmasters except the Head , who showed his wisdom merely by exposing the boyto good literature in his private study . Kipling was describing his own youthful experience , and we are justified in doubting whether lie would have benefited by the modern courses in shortstory and verse writing . To quote Kipling 's case is legitimate . It is typical of the English attitude towards literary aspirants . Not only in schools , but in the home , in factories , offices , and in ships at sea , I have encountered that harsh inclement state of mind which discouraged the weaklings , so that their ambitions died away and they became reconciled to some modest and useful function in our industrial system . In America the opposite seems to he the rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintest sign , real or fancied , of the literary and artistic faculties . We have reached a point where the manufacture of authors on a quantity-production basis is in full force all over the country . It is accepted as a logical development of university work , and so it may strike many Americans as highly unreasonable to suggest that the propagation of authorship , especially of fiction , is no part of a university 's responsibilities . Nevertheless , this proposition is herewith seriously advanced , and it is especially contended that the ultimate achievement of schools for fiction is the establishment of mediocrity as the controlling influence in American literature . The general atmosphere of warm humid and profitable benevolence towards authorship , however , is not confined to our great institutions of learning . It parades the market place , and scores of gentlemen teach novel-writing and short-story writing by mail . It permeates the home , and parents whose children have revealed the shocking precocity of a poem or essay forthwith begin to plan a literary career for the little monster , instead of giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may be thought an uncharitable view . I have no hesitation in asserting that it strikes anyone raised in England as remarkable ? this lack of a sense of proportion in dealing with the adolescent beginnings of literature . I speak from experience . I wrote from the age of eight . I am convinced that the fairly happy life I have led since , and also any success in the business of writing I have achieved , is largely due to the bracing animosity of schoolmasters , fellowscholars , and the home circle . Success in any of the arts , I imagine , derives fundamentally from a profound and usually unconscious conviction , situated in the very center of the child 's being , that there is some mystical connection between itself and writing or drawing or music . It is , to speak fancifully , a sort of burning incandescent point in the child 's inmost soul , which is the promise of greatness . To imagine that family antagonism and derision will quench this conviction of the child is to ignore the almost universal lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack upon the teaching of English , or upon education , but upon the presentday infatuation for " courses " in the practice of fiction-writing . And if teachers of literature , who understand how such aids to students are straitly confined to the mere outlines of the subject , imagine the general public so regard them , I may mention an adventure of my own when I lived in New Orleans . The lady with whom I boarded for a while had a son , a youth in his teens , and when I came home at night he was to be found in the parlor , studying from series of severely practical-looking CLIL ? No. 910. - 29textbooks . He was about sixteen , and my own conjecture was that he was learning algebra and trigonometry , or possibly French and Latin . One evening . I took up the open hook and I was dumbfounded to find that he was learning how to write short stories . Another little book was devoted to electrical engineering . Sheaves of papers , received by mail from a college in Western America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet respectable lad , and I was moved to lead him into conversation . Yes , he was going in for short-story-writing . No , he did n't find it very difficult . He was " studying the structure , " he said , I bashfully remarked that some years previously I had had a small hook published . " Of course , " said this remarkable young man , " that comes later . " Now the extraordinary thing about this boy and his little textbooks was that he possessed not the remotest conception of what lie was trying to do . He had no curiosity , and the writer who has no curiosity is condemned for all eternity . Here was I , a foreigner , a stranger within his gates , sitting there telling him I had not only written a book but had got it published in London ? the Mecca of the Western World in the Nineteenth Century ? and he never even glanced in my direction ! When I was his age , anyone who had written even a magazine article was enveloped in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the subject , I can only say that literature is glamour and nothing else . If you can not master the evocation of that , all your writing is no more than a sorrowful waste of time . If your music , your painting has no glamour , you were better ? employed in a garage or a carpenter 's shop . Indeed , I would go further and say that a man can achieve that magic in the garage and joinery if he is a true craftsman . And there are many , many young men and women in this country to-day industriously fagging through courses in fiction and playwriting and short-story writing who are destined to the most tragic disillusionment in the future , and who might have had true happiness in making engines , or clocks , or tables , and cabinets . II Now this nation-wide illusion that all arts and professions can be taught by mail and works of art produced by the methods successful in commerce has engendered a correspondingly artificial state of mind in everybody connected with literature . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkable resemblance to the whitejerseyed squad at a big football game . They are , in fact , the cheer-leaders of literature . They work upon the principle that if you only believe in your side and yell loud enough you can overturn the laws of God and of nature and score a goal . This argument is sound if literature is merely a struggle between publishers , each with his team of star authors who are being trained to bear down all opposition . It is justified if literature is to be classed with motor-car and steelbillet manufacture or the stock-yard industry . But if , as we are assuming here , literature is one of the fine arts , then the cheer-leaders , the bally-hoo barkers , the artful dodgers of the advertising department and the deep-breathing press agents , the producers of the spurious exfoliations of rococo English so dear to the blurb-writers ' heart , are arrogating to themselves a position out of all proportion to their real significance . Literature as a fine art is to-day in the position of a parasitic growth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the presses rumbling . The publisher who finds the capital involved in producing the works of original thinkers and creative artists derives that capital from the production by hundreds of thousands of copies of what I call trade-goods . He probably derives it also from the sok .... of magazines which , in their turn , are supported by advertising of merchandise . The fact that a work of outstanding original beauty occasionally runs into six figures and makes money is no rebuttal of the main truth of my statement . The change in our lives during the last fifty years , the materialisation of pleasure through machinery , has thrust literature as a fine art into the discard . It is in the position of a gentleman of breeding who has fallen on evil days and whose stately residence has been bought by a lusty full-blooded young barbarian who has installed a gasoline station and a delicatessen store . I am prepared to hear vigorous protests against such a view , but an honest survey of modern life will prove the essential truth of this statement , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferance in the midst of an immense army of mechanical devices for the production of pleasure . / can explain what I mean by this new aspect of the standing of literature by a comparison and a story . I live in a small town and , like every other small town in America , we have a motion-picture theater . We are pretty well served in the matter of pictures ; but what I call trade-goods , that is to say goods useful for trading with the natives of these regions , predominate . In the movies such goods consist of pictures which are the descendants of the Nick Carter dime novel . It may surprise the motion-picture people , but it is a fact that the public which supports such pictures is not really seeking pictures at all , but stories . What they want is the dime novel without the fatigue of reading it . Here they get it . About forty per cent of the footage of such pictures is titles , and if you look round you can see your neighbors forming the words of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a picture of this kind one evening not long ago which drew us in , and the heroic cowboy with the three-gallon hat it was having a hot time with the bad men of those parts . The action consisted of an interminable series of sudden mountings , gallopings , and shootings . The theater was well patronised by small boys who applauded vigorously . But seated next , to me was an elderly woman who had just run out from her home to seek a little change from her life of drudgery . She had no hat , and her toilworn hands were ungloved . And how she clapped ! It was almost painful to watch the desperate fascination that foolish cheap picture had for her . When the hero leaped into the saddle and tore away down the street her emotion became almost ungovernable . Her lips quivered . Her eyes were full of tears . Her frame was shaken by gusts of genuine feeling . She raised a clenched fist to her lips . And it suddenly struck me that for such as she that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window looking out upon the golden country of romance . It offers in the one form which she is able to comprehend an escape from the deadening effects of our much-vaunted age of mechanism . The position of literature to-day is something like the position of religion in the mind of that poor woman . It is very fine , no doubt , and worthy of respect , but she does not understand what , it is all about . When she wants to forget her troubles she goes , not to the church , not to the library , but to the movies when there is a good " western . " It is there she is taken out of herself , and by ways impossible to you and me finds some of that glamour of which I have spoken , which justifies many despised forms of art , and which leads us back , by a reasonable transition , to my main argument . It is this , that the systematized exploitation of courses in writing assumes two major fallacies : First , that there is any real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the methods adopted are of any use for stimulating the creation of literature . It is to be understood , of course , that I am now expressing solely my own views It is possible that there is not a single other person in the United States who holds these views . As I see it , a wholesome neutrality on the part of public educational bodies would be a sound position to take with regard to the creative urge in young people . I have a suspicion that educators and their colleges have ample work before them in providing a good grounding in what used to be called the humanities . If the eager young people who want to get a story accepted by the popular magazines insist that they do n't want to bother with Beowulf and Piers Plowman and Moli ? re and Dc Musset , that they want to be taught " how to do it , " it is proper to tell them that there is nothing in the world , from the beginnings of history down to the present day , from Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire factory , which will not be of some sort of use to them in showing them how to do it . The chief duty of those who teach English should he to show how the poem , the story , the novel grows out of the writer 's own personality . If there is anything in it at all of value , it is because virtue has gone out of him into that piece of writing . I fancy it is the same with music and painting . I fancy that it is because so many young men and women are devoting their lives to literature before they have any life in their minds to devote that we discover nothing of any value in what they write . They Iack something which I have mentioned more than once in writing on this subject , something which La Farge calls " the acquired memories of the artist . " No college , no university , no institution in itself can offer as part of its curricula these acquired memories . Compared with these , the study of rules and fetiches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every age has its market conditions , and if you go back , say thirty years , you will find men in America , who are utterly forgotten to-day , who understood those conditions and became wealthy by writing for the magazines , although they had no courses in " the structure of the short story " to aid them . Someone may insist , at this juncture , that if literature is to lay claim to the title of a fine art , it must be taught to those seeking to practice it as are the arts of painting , sculpture , dancing , drama and music . It is an interesting contention and deserves some consideration . As regards the plastic arts , the analogy is defective because practically the whole of the vast paraphernalia of tuition is devoted to the teaching of an unfamiliar medium . The majority of people go through life ignorant of drawing , but they nearly all have a reasonable acquaintance with the arts of reading and writing . They arrive at the age of intelligence equipped with what we may call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some crude fashion , every day . Their daily life is carried on in a medium of which literature is merely the art-form . Painting , sculpture , and music have no such advantage in daily life . The very tools and materials of such vocations are unfamiliar to all save their practitioners . They have , in the true meaning of the word , a technic . Painters and musicians have the same road to travel as the woodcarver , the jeweler , the etcher , and lithographer . They have a world of technical difficulties to master , and the only way to master them is by practical instruction . The same thing applies to the art of the playwright and the scenario-writer , who is only a playwright after all . It is said that Pirandello writes his plays at a table on the stage , just as the Hollywood scenarist works out the intricate details of his script on the studio set . This art of providing the raw materials of a stage-play or a motion picture is so far removed from both literature and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of the novel and short story . These latter are presented directly to the reader and depend for their success upon an appeal to his imagination in the medium most familiar to him . Thescript of a play depends for its success upon the actor , the manager , and the scenic artist . It is a shot in the dark . The technical difficulties are so numerous and so elusive that after years of distinguished practice , combined with imagination and genius , the result is often flat failure and heavy financial loss . Nothing of all this applies to the art of fiction , long or short . Our problem is something utterly different . We have to compete not only with all the other arts , not only with love and business and the intercourse of daily life , but with the inevitable indifference engendered by familiarity with our medium . Four out of five bankers , lawyers , doctors , and bond salesmen , to say nothing of newspapermen , have the plot of a story in their systems , which they are going to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only doing what they simply can not find time to do . This is hound to have an influence upon their attitude towards what they read , even though it be an unconscious influence . It is so easy-to read ! The work upon which we toil for weeks and months , upon which we ruminate for years before we come to the dreadful moment of beginning to write , is scanned and scorned in a few minutes of boredom when there is nothing else to do . Moreover , the majority of authors are far from dependable witnesses as to their own methods . They attribute to technical processes the glamour deriving from their own unique and inimitable quality as literary artists . The result is that about the only book of first-hand value on this subject is a savage satire . If you wish to know how to write short stories , read How to Write Short Stories . I commend it in place of the dreary volumes of research so exquisitely derided in Leonard Bacon 's Ph.D.s . The lesson Mr. Lardner 's remarkable book teaches is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is that the quality in a story , the art , the glamour is utterly unteachable , either in class or by mail . III My own feeling in this matter is that " research " as it is called , is scarcely applicable to the business of writing . The secret of an author eludes you if you begin to analyse . How can you analyse glamour ? How can you " teach " writing short stories and novels to young people who know nothing of the world , the flesh , or the devil ? Literature comes out of our lives . It is not embedded in textbooks . The impulse to write springs from within , the sense of form can be derived only from the acquired memories of endless reading . As for the rules about " structure , " if I were to offer advice based on my own experience I would say that the best way to sell a story is to break every rule in every textbook ever published . Conrad , Sherwood Anderson , Katherine Mansfield , and A. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go through the conventional rules like a bull through a fence . Who taught them what they know ? I was once told that John Bentley , the architect of the great Byzantine cathedral in London , designed it almost on his knees . Some of our great writers give you that impression . You can perceive , wrought into their style , the years of conflict with life and its illusions . Most of them , you will find , are humble . They do not talk big about themselves and slightingly of those who have gone before . That , you will discover , is one of the prerogatives of the present-day fashionable shortstory writer . He not only feels that he is superior to John Milton because that author received forty-five dollars for " Paradise Lost " while he himself gets perhaps a couple of thousand dollars for ten thousand words , but he feels his story is superior to Milton 's . Perhaps it is . Perhaps we are now in the upward surge of a vast renaissance of literature . We are assured by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . They leap into the air before us and go through astonishing contortions of speechand gesture to evoke a burst of cheering from us for their side . Whether we are really renascent or not , we must wait a few decades to discover ; but we are certainly complacent . One of the most remarkable teams of cheer-leaders we have with us to-day is composed of the new-style reviewers . I am not blaming them , because the writers of jacket-blurbs have stolen their thunder . They have been forced by penury and the increase in the amateur literary population to adopt strange antics in order to attract attention . To be quoted you must use strong language . You must do handsprings and bellow through the megaphone at the same time . In the course of a single week recently I learned from reviews that John Galsworthy is the worst shortstory writer who ever lived ; that most of Conrad , Stevenson , and Walter Pater is sheer bad writing ; that Jack London has come back from Hell and has written a new novel under another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore , and Congreve so insignificant that a single story by Ring Lardner overwhelms all he ever wrote . One of the above reviewers complains that reviews are ignored by the public when buying books . Is it any wonder ? Not one of those statements is believed by the person who made it . They are simply frantic bids for the attention of a milling mob of people who care very little for literature anyway , who amuse themselves with radio , motoring , golf , bridge , phonographs , vaudeville , newspapers , and movies , and to whom books are furniture . Reading books are to be had from the library , while works of reference , bought during the cross-word puzzle epidemic , are now tolerated because they make a good base for the loud-speaker . These reviewers are a symptom of what I have mentioned , that literature is now a parasitic growth , and the sooner we realize it the sooner we shall come to our senses . Making incantations over it , gnashing our teeth , clenching our fists , and leaping into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coinpetition with modern iueelianical diversions . The rah-rah spirit in the literary world will inevitably react against the exploited books . People read what they will . Sooner or later they drift back to what they like . I am beginning to wonder , now that I am middleaged and acquiring a sense of proportion , whether that particular quality which we recognize a.s genius has any bearing at all upon an author 's acceptance . I think it is more a " divine accident , " to borrow a phrase from Arnold Bennett . To take a concrete instance , the extraordinary vogue of Dickens was and is in no way dependent upon those qualities we value most in him as a master of English and an unsurpassed delineator of character . As we say , people read a book for the story . This fact , however , is often used nowadays to pooh-pooh the existence of any quality in a book except the popular story . Popular authors point to the fact that authors whom nobody would ever accuse of genius have exceeded Dickens as a seller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers who demand pep and punch and zip and zoom , and art can go hang . The inference we are asked to draw is that if they chose they could produce great art , but they do n't choose to do it . They deceive themselves . They can do only what they are doing . They are the product of their century as much as are the makers of radio sets and motor cars and movies . They are very useful and estimable members of society . They are ? as I have found by personal correspondence , and an industrious perusal of interviews ? very anxious not to he regarded as artists . They have no need to worry . A few years , and they will have had their day and ceased to be . I said they deceive themselves ; but what is their error compared with those leaders of literary thought who embrace the deception and endeavor to win the favor of the illiterate public by enthroning the writers of tedious pot-boilers in the halls of light ? Are they not described with disturbing veracity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who " . . . dubs his dreary brethren Kings " ? It is possible these cheer-leaders of mediocrity are sincere , but they have no right to the positions they hold if literature is one of the fine arts . suspect that in the hack of their minds they have a confused notion that , if three or four million people buy the books of a certain author , we are obliged to concede him or her a prominent position in literature . At the risk of being regarded as conceited and high-brow , I assert that we have no right to do anything of the kind . Literature is not a democracy where numbers rule . It is an aristocracy where brains and originality are paramount . It is a fond foolishness on the part of many apologists for popular mediocrity , that to be sincere , to reach the great heart of the common people , is all that we know or ever need to know . That is very fine , but it has nothing to do with literature . Democracy is very fine , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of literature and of art . It may be said indignantly , and the cheer-leaders will support it with a crescendo of yells , that if we must choose between democracy and literature we will abandon literature . I can only retort , in the vigorous jargon of the day , that that is all right with me . It is more than likely that we shall all have to make that choice sooner or later in the coming years . The doctrine that those who have the money and the numbers should dictate the nature of religion and science , has already become established in the Republic . What more probable than that the quality of a work of art should be referred to the same omniscient . tribunal ? In that day , " when the windows of the house shall be darkened and the mourners go about the streets , " we shall have no more of the " excellent beauty that bath a strangeness in its proportion , " We shall all be thoroughly grounded in the rumble-bumble of THE CHEER-LEADER IN LITERATURE 46 9 psychoanalysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novel , and the short story , and we shall all have hearts pounding with sincerity and moral felicities . Well , it may be asked , and what then ? Is there any objection to literature being organized ? Will not the product be better than now , with no supervision ? It is quite possible . Let that pass . When that day comes 1 am going to read , not books , but advertisements . It is my guess that American originality will seek this escape from an intolerable regime . The change will be imperceptible , of course , but inevitable . Those who want fine art in what they read will turn the pages of the magazines and read the publicity . Already in many organs it transcends the text . They will buy books like Mr. Shaw 's plays ? with a small thin slice of authorship in the middle between fifty or sixty pages of clever and readable blurb . Advertising corporations will hire standardized authors to write stories to fit their new volumes of appreciations . Perhaps we shall not be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day comes into every room over the radio , the newspapers will consist entirely of brilliant comments on the season 's merchandise . When the scenarists of the movies adapt their titles to normal intelligences , the need of novels will vanish . The time may come when the very existence of literature as a fine art will depend on the advertisement . The contemplation of such a possibility leads one to conjecture whether literature , in the sense of being a manifestation of that incandescent point in the soul of man , in the sense of being the expression of an original personality rather than the common denominator of a manyheaded mediocrity , is destined to endure throughout the ages . There was a time when it did not exist and that time maycome again . " The literary art , " says Havelock Ellis , " lies in the arrangement of life . " It implies " the transforming of the facts of life into expressive and beautiful words . " For several hundred years men have been doing that in the English language , and some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of our admiration . So far from believing that their success can be duplicated by everybody who takes a course in the art of writing , we have nursed a foolish undemocratic conviction that what they did was inimitable . In this matter of art , the rules governing commerce and industry are not to be invoked . It is dangerous , in art , to do as others do , says a French writer whose name I have forgotten . He meant that it ought to be dangerous . His statement implies an attitude towards art which I suggest is worthy of our attention . It implies that the evocation of works of art by means of words and phrases is not a trade to be learned by every earnest young person who can read an advertisement , but a holy mystery , demanding a special equipment of heredity and experience . Then what is the conclusion of the whole matter ? What can we teach of English ? My own impression is that we can teach very little , but we can inspire . Our first need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and books of familiar quotations tend to he over plentiful in these days of cardindexes and specialists . More than in any other calling , has the teacher of English need of a colossal general knowledge . He should be a master of allusion . He must take all knowledge for his province . And he must maintain an indomitable faith that somewhere among those unpromising young people before him there is one at least with a spark of the divine fire .
