txt It .. is with a sentence that should stir the nation that ex-Governor LOWDEN began his address last night : " Our agriculture is decaying and we seem unable to grasp the fact . " Since 3920 the farmer would have been better off as a farmhand . No longer are farmers tearing down barhs to build bigger ; new barns and fences and farmhouses are rare . Abandoned farms are found now in nearly every State as a quarter of a century ago , before the coming of the Summer residents , they were found in New England solely or chiefly . The colleges and universities are crowded , but the agricultural schools are dwindling in attendance . It is a depressing picture , and despite all the optimistic interviews of financiers , encouraging magazine articles and ingenious index numbers to the contrary , Governor LownEN insists , it is a true one . Before there can be constructive improvement there must he a recognition and brave facing of the serious situation . It is not only ; serious " ; the ablest farm economists agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due , in their estimate , to the great disparity between the prices of the things that the farmer has to sell and of those that he has to buy . Sheer necessity , growth of population and its greater demands , will bring about some adjustment in a long period of time : but under such a laissezZaire attitude there will be disastrous consequences , perilous to the people as a whole . The problem is stated concretely in the Governor 's own experience as a farmer out in Northern Illinois : Now , I produce both corn and milk upon my farm . I feed the larger part of my corn in the form of silage to my cows . I sell it , therefore . in the form of milk . I receive considerably less ' for it than I did a year ago And so these glowing figures of the increased value of the corn crop , over which the financial writers of the great metropolitan clailies ? Float . do . not comfort ' me. much . I am indeed puzzled to know what to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty bushels of corn to the acre is a finer achievement than to produce fortyfive . I like to see the milk pall brimming full with sweet , pure milk . But when I see fortyLfive bushels of corn worth more than sixty bushels of corn , and when I see the milk pail but two-thirds full worth more than the brimming pail of another year , I become confused and hardly know what to do . He cites like experiences of others with , other crops and concludes that something is wrong with our methods of marketinis when the aggregate money value ' of a larger crop of a prime necessity is smaller than the value of the smaller crop . What can bedone to lessen the disparity referred to and hasten an adjustment before the worst has come ? ) Mr. LOWDEN 'S answer is that agriculture must conform to the practices found necessary to the success of other great industries . Organize ! Not that farmers are to adopt a corporate form of organization and operate farms through corporate management . It would be a menace to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their individualism in this ' ' Ay . " But organize for the marketing of products " at a price which " will enable them to- live and go on " producing . " Cooperative marketing is not an experiment either abroad or at home . Some associations have failed , but the mortality is no greater than among business organizations , and the prospect is that such associations . benefiting by their experience , will " occupy the entire field . " This conscious constructive effort Is , to this experienced and distinguished farmer who knows also the ways of industry and business and the concerns of a commonwealth as well , the only way out of the present depressing state of agriculture . It is the only way ' of achieving not only a " balanced ' agriculture . " but also a balanced national prosperity . For in the last resort the prosperity and happiness of the country at large rest upon the shoulders of the farmer , as the earth did , in the ancient myth , upon the shoulders of Atlas . But the relationship spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Governor LOwDEN , the desperate state of the farmer is not .
