txt THE DEMOCRATIC HOPE . In Refusing to Sacrifice Principles or Compromise on Them . To the Editor of The New York Times : It was with sinking heart that I read in your columns this morning that the Democratic Chairman had relegated the League plank to a secondary position in the campaign program . Presumably this is done in the interests of " harmony , " i. a. , - votecatching . If the Democratic Fogarty is to win this election it will not be by such methods . It can . win only by taking and holding firmly the intelligent statesmanlike position set forth in the Cummings speech and in the platform . It will surely lose if it abandon this ground in favor of " snooping around " after the votes of this group or that . Such a policy is hopelessly discredited and discreditable and is an insult to the general intelligence of the voters at large . Yet the " Peace . Progress and Prosperity " slogan clearly indicates that the trend of the management is back toward the narrow , selfish appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar sordid ideals . I know personally dozens of men who before the nominations fully intended to vote the Republican ticket . They were Democrats , but estranged by an overdose of " progressiveness . " Those men returned to their allegiance enthusiastically only when Cummings and the platform the Democratic Party where it could be called really great . If the campaign managers " pussyfoot " on the stand then taken their votes and influence will go to Harding . Far better that we should go down to defeat upon the great moral issues to which . ' we are pledged than win a sordid victory by renouncing or compromising them . CLEVELAND DEMOCRAT . New York , July 30 , 1920.
