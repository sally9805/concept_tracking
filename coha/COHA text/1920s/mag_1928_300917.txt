" <P> Poor Maudie wept and cringed as she faced her stern accuser , one F. H. Fullom , who proclaimed himself " Secretary of the All British Glasshouse+ Produce Association . " <P> " I knew she was n't selling real British tomatoes the minute I saw her price ! " roared Secretary Fullom . " Real English tomatoes are in such demand that they mostly sell for ninepence the pound , and never less than eight ! " <P> Sobbed Maudie Dallas : " They was as good tomatoes as yourn ! ' Ow was I to know they were n't English ? " <P> The Court , after lecturing Maudie Dallas sternly on her loyal duty as a British vegetable woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The newspaper of world 's largest circulation , London 's blatantly imperialist Daily Mail , headlined its indignant account of the case : <P> TOMATO FRAUD ! <P> <P> + i.e. " Greenhouse .
