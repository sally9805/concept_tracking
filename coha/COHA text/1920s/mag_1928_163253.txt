Professor William Lyon Phelps of Yale received the following letter one bright morning last week : <P> Dear Professor Billy : - <P> There comes to every man during his life a few occasions when words , the medium of expression , are altogether inadequate to convey the deep feelings of his heart . I am now experiencing one of these occasions . Nothing has ever surprised me more or touched me deeper than the receipt of the lovely set of Shakespeare sent me by the boys of your Shakespeare Class . . . . Therefore , Billy , I wish you would read this to the boys or post it on a bulletin board that they may see by my words , though insufficient , how appreciative I am of their generous thought of me . <P> I wonder if the boys , who were as much a party to the shock given the public by the Boxing champion lecturing on Shakespeare as we were , got as great a kick out of the public 's reaction as I did . <P> With deepest gratitude to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autographed set of Shakespeare ) , and with kindest personal regards , believe me <P> Always sincerely , <P> GENE TUNNEY . <P> Two hundred and twenty students had signed the Yale edition of Shakespeare , seven of them with fictitious names . Professor Phelps erased the fictitious signatures before despatching the edition to Fisticuffer Tunney.
