S. plutocrats climbs as quickly as a monkey up a stick , but to more purpose ; for this number , together with statistics on import and export , chain store business , stock and bond markets , is an index to U. S. prosperity . In 1925 there were , judging by the taxes they paid to the U. S. Government , 207 men who possessed yearly incomes of more than $1,000,000 . In 1926 , judging by the taxes that were paid in 1927 and published last week , there were 228 men who possessed yearly incomes of more than $1,000,000 . Incomes over $5,000,000 were seven in 1925 ; in 1926 there were 14 such .
