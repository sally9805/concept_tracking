DEAR SENATOR-McCready Huston-Bobbs-Merrill ( $2.50 ; . <P> <P> When he was a law student Dan Meredith had an interval of nave , idealistic love . He rescued an ambitious , desperate little actress who was just about to earn a job by her acquiescence in a hotel bedroom . Together they went to Atlantic City . Dan paid the bills for a week 's platonic companionship . Then they were seen at dinner by three leading citizens of Dan 's Midwest home town . While one of them told Dan he had a future in law and politics in his own state , another winked dirtily at the girl . Dan grew selfconscious , feared for his reputation , lost courage , quit the resort , leaving carfare to New York for bewildered Laurel Fife . She had never told him her name . <P> Laurel became a headliner . Dan learned grand-scale hypocrisy , back-room politics . When his wife , the wretched heroine of an " ideal ' ' marriage , met death in circumstances hinting of suicide , the obituaries were as respectable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in these coarsened , alcoholic , successful years , and continued to remember the week when he was Galahad . And anonymously she made the big contributions without which Dan could not have become , as he did , U. S. Senator . <P> Author Huston is an experienced newsman who has observed Midwest politics . The background of his story includes a damning portrait of the convention which nominated Warren G. Harding . Purely fictitious are the central scene and characters , the penumbrous stratagems which made Dan Meredith Senator , left him human wreckage . Yet they may well be typical of the recent degradation of politics . The novel , rich in implication , achieves tragic significance .
