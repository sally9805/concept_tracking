An additional series of the letters of Queen Victoria have just been published and simultaneously the life correspondence of Miss Gertrude Bell . The present generation fancies Miss Bell as a superwoman of the desert who died ( TIME , July 26 , 1926 ) , some time after she and certain British expeditionary forces had set King Faisal of Irak on his throne . Interesting is the fact that the sheltered Queen wrote letters no less lusty than those of the feminine " king maker : " <P> Victoriana . Her Majesty never possessed higher or more passionate epistolary powers than at the period covered by these letters ( 1879-1885 ) . * Slashingly she underlines whole sentences and underscores two or three times her more emphatic phrases . The grand themes are first her grief at the political eclipse and final death of Benjamin Disraeli , " dear Lord Beaconsfield ; " and secondly her rage at William Ewart Gladstone whom she would certainly have called a Bolshevik had the word then been invented . <P> Just before Disraeli left the Prime Ministry in 1880 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Beaconsfield , no longer in the sunset but in the twilight of existence , must encounter a life of anxiety and toil ; but this , too , has its romance , when he remembers that he labors for the most gracious of beings . " <P> Upon the death of this so suave and perfect gallant , Her Majesty wrote : <P> " I am most terribly shocked and grieved , for dear Lord Beaconsfield was one of my best , most devoted and kindest of friends , as well as the wisest of councillors . " <P> Against Gladstonian reforms she raged as follows in a letter to Lord Granville , Gladstone 's Foreign Secretary : " The Queen herself can never have any confidence in the men who encourage reform for the sake of alteration and pulling down what exists . . . . A democratic monarchy she will not consent to belong to . . . Others must be found if that is to be . " <P> Though not even Queen Victoria could concoct a more terrifying threat than this-that she might abdicate-the new series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many urging that the most truculently repressive measures be taken against natives in India , Africa , Egypt or Ireland , where " the more one does for the Irish the more unruly and ungrateful they seem to be . " <P> Miss Bell . Very natural and to be expected is the discovery that Miss Bell , who labored so long amid aboriginal peoples , did not advocate their ruthless repression , * as did the Queen . For one thing , Gertrude Bell 's whole life was led in perfect intellectual freedom and with few curbs upon her remarkable physique . After taking a brilliant First at Oxford she was for a time coquette enough to refuse to ride alone , one evening , with a young man in a hansom cab ; but not long thereafter her loves became Persia and Palestine and the wild crags of the Swiss Alps .
