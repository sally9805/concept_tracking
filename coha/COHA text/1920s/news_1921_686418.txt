txt THE GERMAN MIND TODAY . Two Incidents Which May Throw Light on Reparations . To the Editor of The New York Times : An incident recorded in the French re'view France-Etats-Unis , in the report of the committee of ladies who want from Paris to bear salutations to the American army on the Rhine , just received , reveals a state of mind which exists among the Germans at home and I fear even here . ' While the ladies were there the inhabitants of Coblenz asked permission " to celebrate officially and openly " the anniversary of the defeat of tho French in 1876 and the proclamation of the German Empire ! The American Colonel to whom it was proposed simply answered , " I am astonished that you should address such a question ; how can you imagine that I would permit something that would be disagreeable to the French ? " It is a. suggestive reminder of the incident told by Admiral Sims in his book , " The Victory at Sea . " A German submarine had been captured in the open ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their hands , crying " Kamerad " in token of surrender . When the American destroyer drew near to take them off two Gerrnan sailors disappeared below to open the seacoeks . The surrendered vessel began to settle and soon sank under their feet . The Americans picked them all up safely out of the sea , gave them dry clothes and medical care , with plenty of good food , over which they sang . The officers were for a time " stiff and surly , " only unbending when they found how they were treated , ? All the Captain had to say after the dishonorable action was in a letter to a friend : " The Americans were much nicer and more obliging than I expected . " They were in the act of launching their torpedo at the convoy when they were captured . These two incidents seem to explain the German attitude toward reparation today . HENRY A. STIMSON .
