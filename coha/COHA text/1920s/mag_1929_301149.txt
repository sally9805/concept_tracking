In Manhattan last week alert listeners at a Philadelphia Orchestra concert noticed that in the Bach Toccata and Fuge the basses had a new , if perhaps unneeded , sonority and strength . They had previously speculated about a strange black cabinet which stood in the orchestra . A few of the curious investigated afterward , discovered that the cabinet was a variety of the Theremin ether-wave instrument ( TIME , Feb. 6 , 1928 , et seq. ) being used as a regular , recognized member of the orchestra . The new instrument was made especially for Conductor Leopold Stokowski , called a Thereminophone and differed from the better known RCA Theremin in that its tone is controlled by a fingerboard ( rather than by waves of the hand ) , its volume by a pedal . Carl Zeise , regular Philadelphia ' cellist who operates it , is one of several able Theremin soloists-among them Alexandra Stepanoff , who appeared recently in Chicago , George Goldberg and Zenide Hanenfeldt , who teaches some 25 Theremin aspirants in Inventor Leon Theremin 's Manhattan studio . <P> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lately railed loudly and publicly against the " barbaric " practice of applause ( TIME , Nov. 18 ) , stepped off his dais when two of his violists distinguished themselves and happily , forgetfully , led the audience in palm-smacking.
