txt While the folk from the mountain farms are drifting into a placid Dayton today , an armistice until Monday morning having been declared by the Court , the longrange guns of science and theology kept pounding away at each other from a distance of about two miles . That is the approximate space which divides William Jennings Bryan , sitting on his lawn under a maple tree , from Clarence Darrow , reposing , suspenderless , in a cool nook of the Mansion . Mr. Bryan 's " duel to the death " has become a battle of statements . Typewriters clicked merrily in the Mansion . a ramshackle old building built by a Scotch iron man years ago . All day the typewriters have been taming out a chronicle of evolution , prepared by scientists of the defense , but they interrupted their abstruse output long enough to enable Mr. Darrow to reply to Mr. Bryan . This outline of evolution and the argu. ments of both sides are the only things left before the exodus of " foreigners " begins and Dayton settles down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest army of scientific and theological debaters ever got together Under one tent . , Town Glad ' , e1 ' Vie Interlude. , , The little town is'glaci'of alittetiide granted it by the two-day adjourn. meat , for there is only the usual Satur4 day farm crowd in the streets , and peat pie who have been doing more promiscuous entertaining of strange primates than ever before in their lives have been able to get rid of some of them for the week-end . Not that their hospitality is at all abated , but they are a bit fagged out with having twelve " foreign " guests , speaking an alien tongue and thinking alien thoughts at every meal of the day . There is , too , time for them to wonder what Judge Raulston will do about Clarence Darrow 's defiance of the Court on Friday , when he practically dared Judge Raulston to declare him in contempt and at every opportunity jabbed the Judge with his ridicule and satire . Many of the lawyers hereabout and In the larger cities of Tennessee are demanding of Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State that he demand an apology from Mr. Darrow . And in the meantime Mr. Darrow is standing pat and amusing himself by watching the local gathering of the Holy Rollers . " They are better than Bryan , " he said as he stood last night just outside the circle lighted by oil flares hanging from a tree , while men and women exhorted , sang hymns with strange syncopation and writhed in religious ecstasy . " They at least do n't demand that any one join them . They leave other people alone , and their church is free . " Bryan Opens the Word Battle . Mr. Bryan opened the long-distance encounter between himself and Mr. Darrow today by issuing a long statement in which he denounced the cruel doctrine of evolution , the survival of the fittest , and asked how many people knew that Charles Darwin , in his youth a religious man , had been robbed of his faith by evolution and died an agnostic . " The evolutionists have not been honest with the public ; even ministers who believe in evolution have assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity , " he said . " Do they know its effect on Darwin or , knowing its effect , do they dare conceal it from their congregations ? " Mr. Darrow pondered Mr. Bryan 's statement and admitted that man has a " bloody past " and a " bloody present , " and called attention to the fact that in the Great War just ended Christians " shed an ocean of blood that was not even dreamed of on the earth before , " and that ministers of all sorts prayed that their side might win . " No one ever heard of a scientific man who saw the need to call the aid of the law to enforce belief in his theories . " said Mr. Darrow . " The scientific man has always welcomed the fullest investigation , and he , himself , has been the first to consider the way over objection and modify and change his theory to conform to the facts. - Whether man should be proud of his ancestry does not concern science , said Mr. Darrow , adding : " The scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that he began with a lower form of life than to believe that he was made out of hand from dust ; every animal form is higher than dust . " Text of Bryan Statement . Mr. Bryan 's , statement follows ; " We are making progress . The Tennessee case has uncovered the conspiracy against the Bible Christianity ; those who Worship the Bible God . trust the Bible as the word of God , and believe in the Bible Christ are opening their eyes to what e ? olution really is and to its effect when accepted and followed as an Interpretation of man and a philosophy of life . ' Multitudes hate been deceived by the use of the term ' evolution ' to define things that are not evolution . In one of the science books taught in the Dayton High School and referred to in the trial there is a chapter on the ' evolution of machinery . ' Machinery does not evolve : it is an inanimate thing that man designs and improves . The various forms of growth like the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken from an egg or the growth of a human being from a small beginning  --  all these are carelessly described as ' evolution . ' . " The world is now learning  --  most of the world for the first time  --  that evolution , as the scientists teach it . is an Imaginary process , wholly unproved , that begins with life but does not attempt to explain life , and represents man as the climax of a series of changes coming up from a simple cell through millions of forms of life different from man . " This hypothesis makes every living thing known in animal life a blood relative of every other living thing in ant+oat life and makes man a blood relative of them all  --  either an ancestor or A cousin . If this hypothesis were true tee would all be murderers if we swatted a fly or killed a bedbug , for we would be killing our kin , and we would be cannibals whenever we ate any of the mammals that , according to Mr. Scopes 's teaching , are included with man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught by Scopes . Calls It a Cruel Law . " But that is not all . If the evolutionary hypothesis is true , man has come up through the animals below him by a cruel law under which the strong kill off the weak . Darwin argues that the race was necessarily impaired by the suspension of this cruel law . He commended by implication the savages who are eliminating the weak , saying that it left the survivors strong . He even suggested that vaccination had saved the lives of thousands who would otherwise have succumbed because of weak constitutions  --  the implication being that the race would have been benefitted by allowing them to die instead cf prolonging their lives and permitting then to propagate . " He complained that civilized society and medical men attempt to prolong Ilfe every last moment . No more cruel doctrine was ever promulgated . Those who helleve it are robbed of the pity and the mercy that comes of civilization . " To show that Darwin 's heartless doctrine has not been abandoned one has only to read a book that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the name of the author , for I do not care to advertise his name . In his preface he says that he is indebted to some twenty eminent scientists , ' professors and doctors . ' and he singled out for special gratitude a young man recently elected president of a great State university , a man whose career the author predicts will ' be one of the world 's events of the coming generation . ' This eminent educator read the manuscript over twice and ' made many invaluable suggestions . ' On page 34 of this book we are told that ' evolution is a bloody business , but civilization tries to make it a pink tea . ' Then he ' adds : " ' Barbarism is the only process by which man has organ:cally progressed and civilization is the only process by which he has organically declined . Civilization is the most dangerous enterprise on which man ever set out . For when you take man out of the bloody , brutal- but beneficent ha nd of natural selection you place hint at once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous hand of artificial selection . ' Sees Evolution Unmasked . " Here we nave evolution unmasked . That the readers of my statement may not question my veracity , I may say that the stile of the book is ' The New Decalog of Science , ' and that the author on Page 252 says that Nietzsche was ' the bravest soul since Jesus . ' He admits that Nietzsche was ' gloriously wrong ' perhaps , In many details of techknowledge , ' but affirms that he tfas ' gloriously right in his fearless questioning of the universe and his own " The evolutionists bring their doctrine before the public in a jeweled case and praise it as if it were a sacred thing . They do not exhibit , as Darwin did , its bloody purpose : do not boast , as the author above quoted , that barbarism is its only true expression : they do not tell the public that Darwin , who studied for the ministry and in his youth believed in a personal God , and ' in the strict and literal truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Christianity by evolution and died an agnostic , declaring that he did not believe the t there had ever been any revelation and refusing to express himself as to a future life . " The evolutionists olive not been honest with the public Even ministers who believe in evolution have assured their congregations that there is no inconsistency between Darwinism and Christianity . Do they know its effect on Darwin . or , knowing its effect , do they dare conceal it from their congregations ? The ministers should tell their congregations that evolution leads logically to agnosticism ; they should tell them of the wail of Romanes , sometimes called the successor of Darwin . who said in his book , written to prove that there is no God : " ' I am not ashamed to confess that with this virtual negation of God the universe to me has lost its soul of loveliness , yet when at times I think , as think at times I must . of the appalling contrast between the hallowed glory of that creed that once was mine and the lonely mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , I shall ever feel It Impossible to avoid the sharpest pang of which my nature is susceptible . ' " But , this trial has another important effect . The presence of Mr. Darrow here , an avowed agnostic , both as to God and as to immorality ? he has so stated in court before the Judge  --  represents the most militant anti-Christian sentiment in the country . He protested against opening the court with prayer and has lost no opportunity to slur the intelligence of those believe in orthodox Christianity . and to hurl the charge of bigotry against every one who objects to the teaching of evolution in the schools . " Mr. Darrow in the celebrated Leo- 1 pold-Loeb trial boldly arguod that the boys were not responsible for what they did , laying the blame upon their ancestors and their environment , and relieving them of all personality or power to decide between good and evil . Assails " Animus " of Xinority . " Mr. Darrow 's connection with this case and his conduct during this case ought to inform theaChristian World of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to enforce upon the : schools the views of a small minority regardless or the fact that the philosophy of life based upon evolution robs the individual of sense of responsibility to God and paralyzes the doctrine of , brotherly love . " Mr. Darrow shows that truth is be-Ing excluded from the jury merely be:cause a few so-called ' experts ' whom he ? has selected are not permitted to put their prejudiced opinions up against the ; honest conviction of the people of Ten'nessee . " These experts are selected by him : and his associates , and they do not represent unbiased science . Even the so ? ealled ' Bible experts ' whom he wanted : to call were selected by Mr. Darrow and : his associates . From Mr. Darrow 's ' point of view no Christian would be : worthy to be called an expert on the ' Bible until after scientists also selected ihy him had performed a surgical operation on these Bible experts and removed ' from them faith in the Bible as the re:atealed will of God . " The Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God or its belief in . the Bible as our only standard of : morals or in Christ as our only Saviour ' and wisest guide  --  the Christian world : will not give up these sacred things at ; the demand of these intolerant cham  --  pions ? not of science but of an unproven : guess  --  the logical tendency of which is to rob man of his moral standards in : this world and of hope of immortal life . ; in the world to come . ? ? " Yes , we are making progress , and ee can acknowledge our indebtedness ' , to quire a number for unintentional aid . we are Indebted to Professor Scopes , whose devotion to the doctrine that gives him a , jungle ancestry le , so Passionate that though a school teacher , he was willing to become a violator of the law in order to test its constitutionality . But our indebtedness is much greater to Mr. Darrow , Mr. Scopes 's chief attorney . " Mr. Darrow was chosen by Mr. Scopes himself to represent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Christianity , proclaimed for a generation , and his conduct in this case are now known to the world and will arouse the devout Christians of a nation whose prayers ascend in gratitude for the courage of the State of Tennessee , and Mr. Darrow 's attitude will also compel the Christians who take sides with him to explain to their Christian brothers why they defend a doctrine that strikes at the root not only of Christianity but of civilization . Do they know what evolution means ? If so , do they prefer it to the Bible ? " Darrow Replies to Bryan . Mr. Scopes was condemned from the beginning of this case , said Mr. Darrow , in his reply to Mr. Bryan , because of the environment in which the case was tried , but , he said , he did not blame any one in Tennessee for it , and because he does believe that man is largely controlled by forces back of him and around him he is charitable toward his fellow-men . Mr. Darrow 's reply follows : " Before the trial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one interpretatiop of religion in the world . Christianity has had in its rank thousands of able and intelligent men in all the countries of the world , but these are now all satisfied and Mr. Bryan is to be the one and only judge of what the Bible and Christianity means . " The theory of evolution as a scientific theory , was only announced about seventy years ago , and since that time it has been accepted by almost every scientist in the world . It is true that how evolution came about has always been a matter of discussion and investigation by scientific men , but none of them questioned the truth of the theory . " The believers in evolution are by no means confined to heretics , for the realms of religion and science are entirely separate . Among the most prominent evolutionists of the world are multitudes of men in high standing in all the Christian churches . " All of these are pronounced heretics by Mr. Bryan . " No doubt the law of life , through all the past , has been c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : ' Each man is id turn a guest and a dish . Life lives upon the vegetable world and upon thei animal world . Different forms of life kill and devour each other . This is the law of nature , and nothing can change it . And Christianity has not yet succeeded in taking barbarism out of the world . ' " We have just emerged from a great war , where Christians have been busy killing each other , a war which shed an ocean of blood that was not even dreamed of on the earth before . Not only this , but ministers of all sorts were each praying that their side might succeed , and seeking to align God with their cause . " Man has a bloody past , and he has a bloody present . What his future will be can not safely be prophesied . It is perfectly plain that the scientific is as kind and humane and tolerant as the Fundamentalist . In fact no one ever heard a scientific man who ever sought to call the aid of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always welcomed the fullest investigation , and he himself has been the first to consider the way over objection and modify and change his theory to conform to the facts . " Men 's religious views are Involved in this prosecution . It is true that on the subject of God and immortality I am willing to confess that I am an agnostic . I do not know . I fancy that it is a much ? higher position than that of Mr. Bryan , who says that God was made in his image , and is sure that this is true . It is hard to understand how an intelligent man can believe that a photograph of a human being needs only to be enlarged to give us a picture of God . On this subject I am not agnostic . I do not believe it , but , as to the first cause and the power that is at the heart of the universe , it seems to me that most men must confess that they do not know . Recalls Calvin 's Belief . " It Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not entirely , controlled by forces back of him and around him . I hope this has made me more understanding of my fellow-men and more kindly and charitable to them . However , this idea is not so far removed from that of the founder of Mr. Bryan 's sect , John Calvin , who believed that man was predestined for ages to do exactly what he did . " I have no doubt or no desire to have the Christian world give up its belief in God or its Bible , but at least , a very large portion of the Christian world do not regard the Bible as a book of science : they understand that it was written before men knew that the world was round and when they believed that its creation was less than 6,000 years away from the present time , and that the sun traveled around the earth each day , and that the earth was the centre of all the heavnely bodies . Every one knows better now . " Whether man should be proud of his ancestry is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the truth , and no one needs to seek the truth unless he wants to find It . " The scientists think that it is more to man 's credit to believe that he began with a lower form of life than to believe that he was made out of hand from dust ; every animal form is higher than dust . " The scientist does not believe that man has ever fallen , but that he has steadily grown forward . It is the fundamentalist only that believes man was once perfect and that he afterward fell . Sees Scopes Doomed From First , " I did object to daily praying in court . Praying is rare in court , even in the South . I objected to it because of the , peculiar situation wherein Mr. Bryan had sought to make this trial a contest I between religion and science . I thought of all cases , this was one where the court should stand perfectly free from bias . Even the Judge who presides had not followed the regular habit of opening I court with prayer until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense understands the setting and background of this case . We do not blame any one in Tennessee for it , we know that men take their views largely from environment . " But we do know that in this State and under these surroundings , and under the conditions of this trial , Mr. Scopes was condemned front the start , " We are interested in two things : First , that a higher court shall pass upon this case , - and second , that in other States those who wish to pursue truth shall be left free to think and investigate and teach and learn . " We know that the great majority of the intelligent Christians do not accept the literal interpretation for the whole Bible . We have learned here , both from laymen and clergymen , that a large part of the Fundamentalists do not accept it . This doctrine is a doctrine of the literalists , and we are perfectly satisfied that the majority of the Christian Church has long since passed beyond that . " There is a wide difference between Fundamentalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seeks to find basic truth and be governed by that is a Fundamentalist . " A new scientist , Hartley Mather , head of the Department of Geology in Harvard , arrived here today to aid the defense . He came all the way from Nova Scotia , where he was on his vacation , to testify , but as he will not be permitted to do that he will aid in the preparation of the outline of evolution to be read into the court record on Monday . Dr. John R. Neal will open the argument for the defense . Arthur Garfield Hays will follow hint , and then Dudley , Field Malone will speak . Each of these ' men will take from fifteen to forty minutes , and the rest of the defense 's time will be left to Mr. Darrow.
