THE announcement by Mayor Walker that he had gone on the water wagon was legitimate news at the time . It carried the inference , for one thing , that our Mayor had , at some period in his life , not been on the water wagon  --  which surprised all who heard it without startling them . Looking back on this official laxity in law-obedience , it seemed not to violate the conventions , any more than Ruth Elder 's flying for two whole nights over the Atlantic with another woman 's husband ( the Atlantic being one of the non-com-promising bodies of water ) . All , therefore , that we ask of Mr. Walker is that , when he decides to leave the wagon again , he announce it publicly , with the same businesslike solemnity which attended his first statement . We ask this merely for the sake of consistency and balance , and to keep the records straight . PRODUCERS think there is some question about the advisability of broadcasting scenes from their show .. N , They fear that the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend . We scout such fears . After listening in the public will hardly be able to stay away , because of its human desire to check up on itself and see if what it heard is really so . To hear anything over the radio is to be baited , tantalized , and exasperated . Furthermore , the public 's curiosity to see what it hears is not only sharp but catholic . Our desire , for example , to see with our own eyes the man who gives setting-up exercises in the morning has never been anything but overwhelming . Somehow we 've always pictured him as skinny . P- ( - , O a fuel-oil salesman , just the sight of an old-fashioned lump of coal is maddening , so we are told . Now that we think about it , this perhaps accounts for die city 's quaintest paradox  --  namely , the Standard Oil building , which is heated entirely by coal . Evidently the young oil executives are urged to start the day by standing at Beaver and New , watching tons of the hateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good mad . WE are sorry to say that traffic is now a Major Issue with us . The papers report that it took Police Commissioner Warren three-quarters of an hour to drive from Headquarters to the K. of C. Hotel . When the Police Czar himself gets stymied , things are getting to a pretty pass . Perhaps the finest expression of the existing plague was the statement of the Mayor after a day spent studying the transit situation . He declared : " I am still standing where I have always stood . " This week we have two proposals for traffic relief . One is to remove the second gear from Fifth Avenue busses and throw it away . Later the busses can be electrified . The second is to remove the ground floor from all buildings in the city ; pave everything ; abolish curbs , streets , and signals ; hang all sidewalks out of the second-story windows ; and then allow traffic to proceed directly toward its destination in a natural manner . THIS week a military tournament took place in Madison Square Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christmas tree . It arrived eight years and eleven months after the conclusion of a bigger and somewhat dirtier affair , and three years and one month after the opening of a play called " What Price Glory " before an appreciative ( except Admiral Plunkett ) audience . For as low as fifty cents , this week , you could witness  --  and applaud machines of extra-high killing value , gas that leaves sick or dead anybody who sniffs it , tanks , barbed wire , Generals , and other devices of miserable intent . Thus effectively dramatized , this glamourous Eighth Avenue war  --  which was obviously straight propaganda  --  proved as alluring as the recruiting posters on Forty-second Street that depict life in the Army as a tea party on the palmetto shore of a Polynesian Island , dusky maidens attending . The American idea of Truth-in14 OCTOBER 22 , 19 27 Advertising seems to apply to everything except the Army and Navy . With balloons , transatlantic flights , and military tournaments , these organizations are allowed to represent their product ( war ) as beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . What Profit ? WE read in the newspapers the rumor that Tex Rickard is to resign as head of Madison Square Garden , but we did n't know what the ado was all about until the situation was explained to us last Monday by a man who knew all about it  --  or nearly all . This gentleman was not , oddly enough , one conversant with sporting matters , but hailed from the realms of practical finance below the deadline . We unfold the tale . The quality of Mr. Rickard 's imagination is attested by the building and the success of the new Madison Square Garden , but who could have told in 1923 , when the Garden project was materialized , that boxing affairs would be netting two or three million dollars ? The answer is , not Tex Rickard but perhaps the financial firm of Hayden , Stone &; Company . At any rate , the final arrangements for the building of the Garden made that year provided that the building be financed from NATall Street and that Mr. Rickard sign a contract to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman from the deserts of Nevada and the dance halls of Alaska ceased to be active in his own behalf and became the instrument of the Madison Square Garden Corporation . Now when the newspapers report that Mr. Rickard makes half a million dollars on a fight it is n't Mr. Rickard at all but the company . He has a stock interest and he gets a salary , but his stock is popularly reported to he only six per cent of the total and his dividends plus his pay do not come to anything like half a million a year . These then , if we have reported them correctly , are the facts . What our informant does not know is what Mr. Rickard is thinking about . The cartoonists and columnists have been pounding him in print lately . Their jibes have been aimed at him personally rather than at his Wall Street hackers and the twelve hundred stockholders , among whom are doctors , ministers , nurses , speculators , and the traditional widows and orphans . Too , Mr. Rickard realizes that as championship boxing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better by promoting two or three fights a year on his own and not taking a year-round job which includes these as part of his routine . We have seen an analysis of the figures on the Garden issued by a stockbroker ; in it investors are reminded that Mr. Rickard is under contract and that all profits that accrue from any of his promotions anywhere in the world go to the corporation except ( for reasons unexplained ) events staged in Idaho , Arizona , Nevada and New Mexico . Spy THE dirtiest trick of the week con- cerns customs inspection and a little female person , quite well dressed . Approaching a friend of ours who had just landed , she said in a knowing way : " How did you make out ? " " I got away with murder ! " said our friend . " Then come with me , " said the little lady and led the way to the nearest inspector for another going-over . We have been unable to learn whether she works for the government or was just a volunteer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Nan Britton which we feel obliged to report . The publisher of her book , " The President 's Daughter , " in which she chronicles her love affair with President Harding and the birth of their child , decided to send out circulars advertising the work . These required one and one-half cents postage . After several thousand had been mailed , it was noted that the stamps bore Harding 's picture . Thus the former President 's portrait had accompanied every letter . As for the book , we understand it is selling at the rate of a thousand copies a day , a phenomenal sale for a five-dollar volume . The Anti-Vice Society has attempted to suppress it , and large wholesalers and retailers have made an effort to boycott it . Ninety per cent of the critics have ignored it , and magazines and newspapers have refused it advertising space . Miss Britton has been threatened , they say ; a truck carrying the plates of the book was set on fire , telephone wires to the publisher 's offices have been cut , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann Guild , which were labelled as " probable plans . " This surprise attack , however , caromed off the architectural problem , leaving it still unsolved , and burst open the delicate real-estate question . Neither Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt nor Mr. Robert Walton Goelet , it appears , have ever been satisfied with the Fifty-seventh Street site . Mrs. Kahn is said to be on their side as well as in favor of the more conservative architect . Central Park West is the location most mentioned now , architecture by Mr. Morris . Mr. Otto Kahn is reported to think that it will all end in there being no new opera house for another five years at least . Yes , It Was Tonsils CONTINUOUSLY calm in em- ergencies is the droll Edward Liman Bill , whom we reported on some time ago when he invented a fake card game because he did n't play bridge . His most recent crisis was a throat operation . When he get back to the office he was met by associates ready for a long chat . Mr. Bill was ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he handed out . These said " It was tonsils . No , they would n't let me have a local anesthetic . No , I did n't mind it . Yes , I 'm getting better . No , the nurse did n't have dimples . Thanks for the inquiry . Pardon me for writing but my throat hurts . " They say he spent a lovely day and got a lot of work done . Rodeo NE way , apparently , to get over 1 .. -1 in a social way is to come to town dressed in chaps and spurs and leading a pony . Cowboys , now here for the rodeo , arc being taken up by people who matter , and it looks as though the forthcoming Garden affair had gone definitely Four Hundred . On one of the nights , after messing around with steers and calves and bronchos , the boys will attend a supper party given by Dr. Henry C. Fleming . They are being feted in Westchester , we hear , and d.6butantes are occasionally discernible selling boxes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year the cowboys were entertained by Gerald Dempsey at his polo farm on Long Island . They went and enjoyed it . The reason society smiles on these western braves , so we understand , is that they are not particularly conscious that they are fashionable . Opposed to the patrons are the persons who fear that the rodeo is brutal . This group is headed by Mrs. Phillips A. Clark , owner of a racing stable and a horsewoman of note . Last year zealous opponents of the event were accused of giving little boys lollypops for tearing down rodeo posters . We regard it as an interesting situation no matter how you look at it . Levity in Business T " younger generation must have been more than getting into trouble lately . ' We have heard of a junior partner in his uncle 's Wall Street firm who , in the past , has derived amusement out of addressing and alluding to the mechanic who comes occasionally to repair his ticker equipment as Mr. Carlton , having in mind none other than the workman 's ultimate employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , himself . The young man had done this so often that he thought he would be thoroughly understood by a colored porter , a venerable employee , whom he summoned recently when the ticker suffered a breakdown . " Call up Mr. Carlton and tell him to come right over and fix this thing , " he said . The porter bowed and acted immeDime Novel UPON requesting , the other day , to view some of the works of the Beadle Collection of Dime Novels which is kept in the Reserve Room of the Public Library , we were asked if we had any connection with the movies . " Dr. O'Brien , the donor , " we were informed , " has reserved the right to withhold the books from motion picture people . " This deepened our interest to such a degree that we paid a visit to the author of this discrimination , who is a New York dentist and whose name is Dr. Frank P. O'Brien . He confessed having made the reservation we have mentioned and went on to exhibit to us an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred volumes which now rests aristocratically in the library . There are nearly three thousand in this second collection . They are kept in two huge safes . Dr. O'Brien permitted us to take a handful of them to hold and let us turn the pages of " Malaeska , or , the Indian Wife of the White Hunter , " the first dime novel published in America . It is by Mrs. Ann S. Stephens , and was published May 15 , 1860 , and shortly was translated into five different languages.persons are wont to remark that autumn does n't seem to he as far advanced in Central Park as it is in the country ; next spring they will note that the flora of the Park seems to be ahead of that in Westchester . We have at last met an expert in such matters who can explain this phenomenon . The Central Park season is a full four weeks longer than that in the suburbs . The crocus appears two weeks earlier and the grass stays green two weeks longer . The reason is , our informant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asphalt which is New York absorbs , retains and gives out so much heat that it moderates the climate . Some parts of the city are ten degrees warmer than the environs . This heat causes another phenomenon . It supports tons and toils of fine dust high over the town . This constitutes the perpetual cloud bank seen from nearby eminences , the Palisades for example . Constantly the dust is sifting down and , among other things , sullying all the roof-gardens in the city . For the satisfaction of those who have looked enviously at the terraces of the Sherry-Netherland we are happy to state that even this lofty structure is not immune  --  no , our authority says , not even the Woolworth Building itself . ?
