At Paris 6,000 Frenchmen donned " horizon blue shirts , dark blue collars , navy blue ties , light gray suits and blue-ribboned felt hats . " Then , swaggering 6,000 canes , they proceeded to assemble and lay the foundations of " blue-shirted French Fascism . " <P> One of their number , M. Jacques Arthuys , harangued the gathering as follows : " Salvation is in Fascism ! Certainly not in disciplined and formalized black-shirted Italian Fascism , but in Fascism adapted to the thoughtful and measured French temperament-less of words than of action . " <P> M. Philippe Barrs , son of Maurice Barrs ( late author-orator ) then defined the spirit of the new Fascism as " Faith in France . . . and a deep disgust with parliamentarianism . " Declared M. Georges Valois , Nationalist economist : " Our work will be . . . to suppress parliament and give a leader to the national state . . . . In replacing the parliamentary form of government , only one of two new forms is possible-Communism or Fascism . Can there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France can be accomplished only by a dictator of finances , who , it is easy to perceive , must be necessarily a political dictator . " <P> The " President " of the assemblage , one Pierre Taittinger , keynoted as follows : " To the violence of Communism we will oppose our force . Our aspirations are not those of the Facism of Benito Mussolini in Italy , nor of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera in Spain . What we want is another Clemenceau , as Clemenceau was and did in 1917 . We want a leader who is real , in whom we can have confidence , and whose word will have authority and power !
