Beautiful was the sight-beautiful weather , beautiful and many women , beautiful flowers and greens about the rostrum at one end of Stanford 's beautiful football stadium wherein California , last week heard the first campaign speech of its first Presidential Nominee . There was no Sidewalks-of-New York thronging . Twenty thousand automobiles were parked on Leland Stanford grounds . An ultimate total of about 70,000 , mostly women , came leisurely into the stadium . <P> First to the microphone ( 107 stations , unknown millions of instruments atune ) went California 's Governor . He told the world New Hampshire 's Senator Moses would talk next , and the smart-cracking Senator told , without smart-cracks , that the Republicans would elect Hoover whom they had nominated and who would now acknowledge his nomination . . . . <P> Long days , the Beaver Man had waited for this sunny moment . For most of a month he had been at his home on a nearby hill . There had not been the least echo of a murmur of excitement , except for newsmen pitching horseshoes nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Attorney General William J. Donovan . This Donovan , " Wild Bill , " is a man of desire and passion and reckless courage but even he seemed to walk more gently in the sun and quiet. * <P> Of course , dozens of others came to that quiet house , bursting , usually , with optimism . They bored the Beaver Man ; so much so , that he invented excuses to avoid them , as for example taking Senator Moses to practice before the Stadium microphone , a Senator who required microphone practice " as much as an oyster needs a Maxim silencer . " <P> The Beaver Man himself had done endless practicing . He had practiced for talking movies , which were sped Eastward . He had gone to the Stadium and read aloud a yellow clipping about the first telephone . He knew his speech almost literally backward . More important , it was agreed that his voice and manner are as good for radio purposes as they are bad for the auditorium . <P> Also , in this waiting time , Mr. Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given at his birthplace , West Branch , Iowa . <P> Also , he had his 54th Birthday , excitement-less , save for a postcard from Calvin Coolidge , four feet square . But , essentially , he just waited . He did so purposely . He was saving his " fireworks " for October . Said Senator Moses : " Again , the Democrats are winning in August ; again , they will lose in November . " <P> <P> * Son of red-haired Irish Tim of Buffalo , there had been a day in France when , in the full regalia of Colonel , and flashing his automatic he had bellowed : " Come on ! They ca n't hit me and they wo n't hit you . Let 's go . " The men he thus summoned at the battle near Landres and St. Georges , he had made iron by drilling them to fight each other naked to the waist and to run miles in bare feet . A poet , Joyce Kilmer , had followed him jubilantly unto death . " Hard boiled " they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
