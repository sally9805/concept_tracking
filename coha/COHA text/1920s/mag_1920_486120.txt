N investigation under way in New York City by the Joint Legislative Committee on Housing to determine the underlying reasons why housing construction has fallen off , has developed a series of indisputable facts so sinister and astounding as to shake profoundly one 's faith in our political structure and in American business morality . It is conceded that the alarming conditions uncovered in the Empire State prevail to a lesser degree in large cities in other States and a Congressio4m1 inquiry seems inevitable . The Joint Legislative Committee  --  or Lockwood Committee , as it is better known  --  is proceeding under a concurrent resolution adopted at the extraordinary session of the legislature called by Governor Smith to pass remedial rent legislation . The New York World is responsible for the resolution , having forced it through the legislature following a campaign it has waged against the Building Materials Trust since July , 1919 . Samuel Untermyer , an attorney of national reputation , had stated publicly that he would smash the combine if vested with proper authority , and the World made an arrangement with Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed to appoint Mr. Untermyer chief counsel and give him full sway if the resolution could be put through . Mr. Untermyer , considering the work a public duty , made the one stipulation that he serve without fee . The committee began its hearings October 20 and since that day each session has brought to light some nefarious method by which the public has been fleeced , house construction has been bedeviled until it has virtually come to a standstill , and prices of materials have been advanced to hitherto unheard of levels . Ample proof has been spread upon the records to show that the wealthiest and most powerful building corporations in America have given crooked and unscrupulous labor leaders wholehearted encouragement and support , while these followers of Judas not only robbed builders with thoroughness and precision , but mulcted the hard-working members of their own unions out of vast sums . That these great pillars of our economic society , controlling untold millions ( of other people 's money ) and posing as honorable men , could have brought themselves to enter upon and pursue this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the day of reckoning is near . It is needless to say that no such conspiracy as this , conceived of the war and born in greed , could withstand the light of publicity , and it is a pleasure to state that it has been thoroughly disrupted . Much remains , of course , to be done , but a remarkable start has been made , and in an incredibly short space of time . Within the two months collusion between captains of capital and leaders of labor has been stopped , permitting builders to press their construction unmolested . Fifteen combinations of manufacturers and contractors have been disrupted , and for the first time since 1916 actual competition prevails in these trades . Matched bidding , by which a great , golden harvest was reaped from municipal and private fields , has been done away with and the chief materials used in the building of homes and business structures have fallen 30 per cent in price . Documentary and other evidence shows that this systematized robbery was made possible by secret agreements entered into between the Building Trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Building Trades Council ; a code of practice plan originating in the fertile brain of John T. Hettrick , attorney for the limestone , heating and ventilating and plumbing contractors , and a " quotation card " system , devised by wholesale dealers in building commodities . These three devices interlocked and brought wealth to their operators . But they Made Brindell , labor leader , czar of the building world and gave him a throttle-hold on construction in New York . It might be remarked in passing that Brindell and Hettrick are now at liberty on $100,000 bail each ; that sixty-five indictments have been returned against the conspirators , and that the bail exacted is in the neighborhood of $1,000,000 . The Hettrick and Brindell exposures were made at the opening session of the committee . The Hettrick matter attracted the greater attention momentarily because the lawyer had so juggled the limestone bids for the proposed County Court House that the city would have lost upwards of $1,000,000 had the deal gone through . This was a large operation for Hettrick , but the total in money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken into consideration . He was a bit careless , a reporter detected the flaw , and the undoing of Hettrick followed . The " code of practice " scheme was simple enough to work well . Hettrick first combined the contractors in a given trade . Then he took the estimates for a given job and raised them . The builder accepted the lowest of the raised bids and the trick was done . A pink , green , and numerical card system served to befog the curious . For his work Hettrick received 1 per cent of the gross on all business , and 3 per cent was split among the unsuccessful bidders . The lawyer always designated who should do the work , apportioning the jobs to suit himself . As the successful bidder on a $100,000 job , for example , would receive $25,000 more than the job was worth there was no occasion for grumbling . When it came to letting the lucrative Court House contract a slight deviation in plan was made . Nine members of the limestone ring were selected to share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done for around $1,000,000 and leave a reasonable profit . For good measure the nine raised the estimate to $1,663,165 and turned it over to Hettrick . He promptly boosted the price to $2,372,000 , which so delighted the contractors that they awarded him 31/2 per cent of the gross . Then they set aside 1 per cent additional for members not in the deal . In childlike faith the Board of Estimate accepted the figure and sent the contract along for Mayor Hylan to sign . His pen was poised when the explosion occurred . This exposure led to an investigation of all schoolhouse contracts , of which $1,445,236 are outstanding , and a close scrutiny of other city contracts aggregating $61,149,265 . Hettrick 's " clients " had a hand in many of these and the Board of Estimate worked itself into a highly nervous state . Some of its perturbation came from a suspicion that Mr. Untermyer might peer into city departments and expose the whole administration . As a passing incident in this phase of the inquiry it developed that Hettrick had considerable influence at City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of certain " clients " that schoolhouse trim be changed from terra-cotta to limestone , he wrote a letter to Mayor Hylan , practically ordering the change made . He instructed the Mayor to forward his letter to the proper city authorities , and that obliging official went him one better . He had Het-trick 's orders copied verbatim on his own official stationery , signed the letter as his own , and sent it along . With great promptness the substitution was made and the city may have lost heavily . Now the Mayor says he " would n't know Het-trick " if he " saw him on the street . " It was some days before Mr. Untermyer discovered where Brindell got his power . He had all the union labor in the city under absolute control . But this did not provide it . Quaking , terrorized witnesses told of graft extorted ; prominent builders hesitatingly related how strikes had been called and maintained until they had met Brindell 's insatiable demands for " berries , " as he called thousand-dollar bills , and house-wreckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more generous favorite . But not one could , or would , tell how this man of heavy jowl and dominant personality obtained and kept his vise-like grip . Little by little , however , the tale was unfolded . December 17 , 1919 , the Building Trades Employers ' Association entered into an agreement with Brindell 's Building Trades Council , whereby the association members were to use none but Brindell workers and the Brindell men were to work for no one not a member of the association . This eliminated from the building field the few independent contractors remaining . With this club in his hands Brindell set out to extort heavy graft and in a few months he had laid away enough to keep the wolf from the door for sometime . What per cent of the victims was haled before the committee no one will ever know , but it was a small per cent . Twenty-one builders and contractors , some of them affiliated with the Building Trades Employers ' Association , reluctantly admitted that they had paid $131,871 to get back on their jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Others told how they and the poorest of paid day laborers had contributed $113,000 which went for " initiation " fees or " privilege to work " cards . These fees were exacted before Brindell would permit house-wreckers affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and whom he had summarily ousted to make room for unions of his own , to work at their trade . The contractors always submitted to a levy for " initiations , " but called on the laborers to pay for " permission to work " cards issued by Brindell . Ten dollars a week was taken from the wages of these men so long as they labored and each Saturday the cash was handed over to Brindell 's agents . Many of these cards have been put in evidence . The " initiation " fees , which ran from $50 to $75 , were paid without question by some of the country 's foremost builders , once they became convinced of Brindell 's power . " Strike insurance " came quite as easily from their pockets . If they were a bit backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of their jobs quickly brought them to time . The strike tolls exacted ran from $32,000 paid by Hugh S. Robertson , of Todd , Irons &; Robertson , to $200 given to Brindell by Israel Goldstein , a house-wrecker with a small business . A number of payments of $25,000 in cash ? Brindell always demanded cash  --  were made by responsible citizens who knew that they would otherwise be ruined . During the second week of December Mr. Untermyer showed the other side of the picture . It was established that the United States Steel Corporation and the Bethlehem Steel Company , in their fight against union labor , have refused to permit structural steel bought from them to be erected in New York or Philadelphia unless the work is done by nonunion men . These great fabricating concerns insist that their product can be handled only by members of the Iron Erectors ' League Association , an organization committed to the fight against labor and favorable to the steel trust if not wholly controlled by it . The names of Charles M. Schwab and Elbert H. Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public is an innocent spectator and has the privilege of paying the bills . Mr. Untermyer declares that this highhanded arrangement constitutes a conspiracy punishable by fine and imprisonment . Manufacturers and wholesale dealers who used " quotation cards " as a means of raising prices and maintaining them at fictitious levels were so successful that costs have been elevated all the way from 100 to 300 per cent . The latter figure is most conservative . In an effort to evade the laws covering criminal conspiracy , prices were never " talked , " but the cards were available at the headquarters of numberless associations and luncheon clubs that " competitors " might not go astray in marking their goods or estimating on contracts . Any member daring to undersell another , or underbid on a contract , was fined , suspended , or expelled . If expelled , labor refused to work for him and that is where the arrangement between the Brindell Council and the Building Trades Employers ' Association to which all belonged came into play . For instance , a marble dealer not a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn was a member of the Building Trades Employers ' Association , or an expelled member , could not set one foot of marble in the United States unless he employed non-union labor . There is none of this among marble workers in New York City , and little in the country . Outside the metropolitan district control is vested in the National Association of Marble Employers . A number of the contracting associations doing a " cost plus " business entered into labor union arrangements of their own whereby they contracted to pay slightly advanced wages . They then agreed among themselves to charge builders an increase of from 50 to 80 per cent for this labor . By way of illustration , the marble men paid $16 a day wages to a setter and his helper . They then sold this labor for $25.75 a day . Of course the men who did the work knew nothing of this arrangement . Within the last three weeks the Cut Stone Contractors ' Association and the Masons ' Supply Bureaus have disbanded . The limestone , marble , plumbing , metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire extinguishers ' combinations have dissolved , and the cement , sand , lath , and plaster trusts have collapsed . They will never be revived if legislation proposed by Mr. Untermyer is passed at the forthcoming session of the New York legislature . The sand trust has been exceptionally strong . Practically every grain used for building in New York comes from the pits of three concerns and is sold through five wholesalers . The price has been jumped from 75 cents a cubic yard to $3.50 . The Munson Steamship line which brought 1,500 tons in ballast from Holland was unable even to give it away . The cargo was finally taken to sea and dumped at a cost of $2,500 . Portland cement is held as closely . Where it formerly cost 95 cents a barrel , its price up to the time the committee became active was $5 . Brick went up from $12 a thousand in 1914 to $32 and was on its way to $56 . It is now $15 . It used to cost $75 to transport a barge of brick from Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one firm , the Cornell Towing Company , controls all the Hudson River work . Three tugs , with a fleet of barges , earn at the rate of $10,000 a day . The committee was taken lightly at first by the malefactors , but it is not now . They and the public generally have found it means business and that wealth and influence ? political or otherwise  --  counts for nothing . Mr. Untermyer saw at the outset that criminal prosecutions would be necessary and he organized a competent staff . He invited Leonard M. Wallstein , counsel to the Citizens ' Union , to become his chief aid and brought in a dozen enthusiastic young attorneys who had made enviable records in the District Attorney 's office when that highly important department meant something . Deputy Attorney General Samuel A. Berger has been assigned to the committee , three grand juries have been pressed into service , and it is not unlikely that the United States Senate Committee on Reconstruction will join hands with the Lockwood Committee . This will make it possible to reach with subpoena a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly to transfer their residences and themselves to Atlantic City and other points outside the state . Early in January , after the committee has been reappointed and given broader powers , Mr. Untermyer will seek to show that life insurance companies and savings banks should be compelled to invest a substantial per cent of their future investable income in improved real estate mortgages , instead of so large a proportion in Wall Street securities . This would relieve the mortgage market , and , with building materials back at a normal level , building operations on a large scale would be possible . The city is short 125,000 apartments and the health and morals of the residents have thereby been impaired . During the winter the counsel will draft a report which will suggest remedial legislation . He feels that if his bills are enacted into law present conditions will not return and that the housing situation will be speedily and permanently relieved . Mr. Untermyer is in the midst of a great work . The public may have faith that it will proceed to a conclusion in the brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He deserves unstinted public confidence and support .
