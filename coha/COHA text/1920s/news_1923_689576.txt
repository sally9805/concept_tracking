txt Advocates of the program for a reduction of Federal taxes by S323.0130.000. submitted to Acting Chairman Green of the House Ways and Means Committee by Secretary Mellon. felt that the early reaction from almost every part of the country was favorable to the proposal . A large - majority " Dof the messages which reached the White House today , it is said , carried an endorsement of the - Xenon plan , and practically all of those which came to the Treasury Department were in favor of legislation along the lines suggested by the Secretary . Among the prominent members of Congress who discussed the issue of ' tax reduction or bonus " were Senator 0 . B. Weller , Republican , of Maryland , and Representative Theodore E. Burton , Republican , of Ohio , a former Senator and a member of the War Debt Commission . Both endorsed the Mellon program of tax reductions and opposed bonus legislation which would make such tax reductions impossible . " It is obvious , " said Senator Weller , in referring to the bonus issue , " that taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people want higher or lower taxes ' That is the question . " Burton States the Issue . Representative Burton expressed his Viewpoint on the issue in this way : " The issue is this : Do you want a bonus , or do you desire relief from taxation ? " W. P. G. Harding , former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board and now head of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank , who is attending a meeting of the Reserve Board with its district agents , also endorsed the Mellon program today . He said the plan contained constructive suggestions for tax reductions which should receive the support of the nation . Treasury Department officials refrained today from any further statements in regard to the program , but were pleased with the general tenor of the reaction that had been awakened , as indicated by comment in the newspapers and statements made by public men The editori comment of many newspapers throw-bout the country is accepted by the tax reduction advocates as indicating that a large majority of the newspapers will support favorable action by Congress . The statement issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Legislative Committee of the American Legion , attacking the Mellon plan as misrepresenting the situation , was p  --  t aside by Treasury officials without formal comment . It was held , however , that the statements advanced by Mr. Taylor were unsound . Treasury to Draft Bill . The Treasury Department is prepared to draft a bill for the consideration of Congress presenting the suggestions made by Secretary Mellon In detail , and it is probable that there will be further consultations among the officials and administration spokesmen on the House Ways and Means Committee if President Coolidge , ; : s now expected , gives the rMellon program an endorsement in his first message to Congress . In political circles it was generally admitted that further talk of the Administration leaders refusing to open up the tax question in Congress during the next session , because of the fear of - e- hat might be accomplished by a combination of the Democratic and so-called radical forces , might as well be dropped . It was accepted as certain that revision of taxes will take its place with revision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress , and that Senator Smoot , who is to be Chairman of the Finance Committee . and any others who oppose opening the question , might as well abandon hope of having their way in the matter . In fact , among some of the leaders it now is felt that the controversy over tax reductions versus bonus will overshadow all other issues before the next Congress , even including the expected fight over changes in the Transportation act . Believe American Legion Is Divided . Some of the advocates of revision of taxes are contending that the sentiment is by no means unanimous among the members of the American Legion for the payment of a bonus , particularly if , as stated by Secretary Mellon , the granting of a bonus would defeat taxi reductions . It is held that evidence of this feeling may become more proflounced when the extent of the tax reductions which Mr. Mellon suggests Evr the smaller taxpayers is fully renii7ed . One of the features of the Mellon pro- i grain which took the bonus advocates by:surprise and gave them much foodI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller taxpayers would , be cut practically in half . It had not been expected that such a heavysaving to this class of taxpayers would be suggested . Representative Burton called at the White House today , but did not see President Coolidge . He had a talk with Secretary Siemp . As he was leaving the White House he was questioned about his stand on the Mellon tax reduction program . Believes Cut Good for tile Country . " I am in favor of the Mellon plan . " said Representative Burton . " I know of nothing that would be more important to the country as a. whole , and its real interest at this time than the reduction of taxes . It will be helpful to the men and women who work for wages , helpful to the business men , and helpful to the community in general . It is my judgment that reduction of Federal taxes as proposed by Mr. Mellon will be good for the country all along the line . It should have an important bearing on the proposition of lowering the-cost of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing could be more helpful than that . " The reductions proposed by Secretary Mellon , while not very great at this time , are nevertheless quite substantial and a step In the right direction . The moral effect of the disposition of the Government voluntarily to lower taxes should be important , and I hope other teps in that direction will be taken wherever possible . It should be possible , by careful effort at Government economy , to make still further reductions . " " Are you in favor of bonus legislation at this time ? " Mr. Buron was asked . " I am not in favor of bonus legislation , " he replied . " Certainly not unless specific provision is made for separate and closely distinguishable taxes to be levied to meet the cost of the bonus payments , so that people win be able to know , when paying such taxes , that they - are paying them for that specific purpose . " The Mellon plan puts the issue squarely up to the people of the country . The issue is this : ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from taxation ? ' Those who work for wages ? if they are to be taxed , or subjected to heavier taxes for the payment or a nonus  --  ought to be able to know that they are to be taxed for that purpose . " I am of the opinion that the real sentiment of the country is strongly in favor of reduction of taxes . Of course , when this matter comes before Congress there will be all sorts of propositions advanced in favor of tax reduction as well as for the bonus . I do not know whether Congress will enact the legislation proposed by Secretary Tls . , - Mellon , but I , for one , intend to vote for tax reduction . " Senator Weller Approves Plan . Senator Weller of Maryland gave his views on the Mellon plan as follows : " The program outlined to Representative Green , Acting Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , by Secretary Mellon , recommending legislation providing for a reduction of $323 , - 000,000 in Federal taxes next year , has my hearty approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reducing the burden of taxation , and it comes from the Federal Government . Taxes have been increasing rapidly in every State in the country , including Maryland , and they are still mounting , " Secretary Mellon 's proposals would reduce practically all Federal taxes . The smaller taxpayer would be specially benefited and the surtax rates on higher incomes would be progressively reduced . The taxes of every one of the 7.000,000 Federal taxpayers in the United States , and of the 150,000 in Maryland , would be reduced . " Mr. Mellon would make a large reduction in the tax on smaller incomes from wages , salaries and professional services ; a decrease of over 50 per cent . in the tax on incomes between $4,000 and $10,000 a year ; would repeal the tax on telegrams , telephone messages , admissions to moving picture theatres , and the so-called nuisance taxes . Changes would also be made to simplify the administration and collection of Federal taxes . " The only objection to this plan comes from those who favor a soldiers ' bonus . A bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Mr. Mellon 's proposition means a decrease of one-third of a billion dollars each year . It is obvious that taxes can not be decreased by increasing them . Do the people want higher or lower taxes ? That is the question . " Congress now is appropriating nearly $300,000,000 a year for the care of disabled war veterans , this being about one-sixth of the total annual expense of the Federal Government , and there is no thought of reducing this amount below that needed for properly taking care of incapacitated soldiers . Every one favors doing the utmost for them . " It may be that Mr. Mellon 's recommendations will not be adopted by the ' incoming Congress , but they will have my support and vote . I am in favor of taking advantage of this opportunity of lowering Federal taxes . The way to secure this relief is to bring to bear upon the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives in Washington the weight of public opinion . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
