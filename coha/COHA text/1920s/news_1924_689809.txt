txt Abandonment on March 5 , after four years of publication , of the Freeman , an independent radical weekly , was announced today by B. W. Huebseh , Inc. , the publishers . The reason given for the step was " successful conclusion of an experiment , " and emphasis was laid on the fact that the magazine retired at the highest point of its circulation . Mrs. Helen Swift Neilson , wife of Francis Neilson , one of the editors and a former member of the British parliament , who was announced for the first time as the founder of the weekly , was said to have agreed to support the Freeman for three years . " while a sufficiently large body of readers to justify a continuation " could be found . Mrs. Neilson , formerly Miss Helen L. Swift , daughter of Louis F. Swift , president of Swift &; Co. , Chicago packers , was married in 1890 to Edward Morris , who died in 1911 , leaving a fortune estimated at 440,000,000 . She married Neilson in Chicago , September , 1917. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
