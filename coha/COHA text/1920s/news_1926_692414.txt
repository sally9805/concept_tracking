txt The rise of the cities of Miami , Miami Beach , and Coral Gables has no precedent on this planet . It is not to be wondered at that many people hereabouts lose their sense of proportion and of equation in values . 411 . ? Florida had a population a year ago of 1,250,000 according to the state census and since then it has received at least 1,750,000 visitors and possibly two million . ? VIM INFLEN The Florida East Coast Railway people tell me they have been %taking 2,500 people a day into Florida right along and only 1,500 out ; and that 75C0 of the people go to Miami . There are only two motor roads into Florida from the north and these show records of 250,000 motors in a year Moving into-the state . It is estimated that they brought in a million new travelers . Hundreds of thousands of people must have come by the Seaboard Air Line and down the west coast , to say nothing of minor routes by land and sea . Of course two million visitors could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now two distinct seasons and the visiting population of the winter season is entirely distinct from the resident and business population of the summer season , and in each season the people come and go . There are probably in every month of the year 500,000 or more visitars within the state of Florida . SEVEN GREAT X. IL . S STEMS Seven great railroad systems feed directly into Florida . They have 750 millions of gross earnings and 150 millions of net earnizigs-12% of the gross earnings and 1.40 , of the net earnings of all the roads in the United States . These seven roads will spend this year more than their entire net earnings in improvements and construction , a large part of which is necessitated by the growth of Florida . The movement in and out of Florida is fructifying the whole South and helping to develop all southern Lands , resources and industries . THEM NATIONAL BENEFIT Whatever be the bad after-effects of land speculation in Florida and whatever be the individual losses hereafter , the country as a whole will be the richer . California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings of the forty-niners ; or the bones that whitened the plains of the West and the dollar losses of the pioneers . But California was thereby opened for benefit of the whole world . The people who were stranded on the Pacific were forced to dig in and produce something besides gold and that something in a few years gave greater value than all California 's gold . The development of the whole South is the great national blessing from the Florida land boom . Soon the South will really mean the sunny South  --  the bright side and not the black side of politics . Florida may soon be for Coolidge , , national protection and Republican progress . Ten million dollars appears to be the unit in Miami business plans ; but all around Miami are hundred million dollar land " propositions . " A few of them will get Eby . Most of them will fail of their goal  --  at least for this generation . SUCCESS FROM FAILtRE S. W. Young , the builder of Hollywood , says , " An success is built on failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great freeze of 1895 which ruined the orange orchards of the state . The first big freeze was in 1894 ; then on February 8 , 1805 , the mercury went down to 20 and 22 degrees and killed all the trees . They had begun to bud , but the frost not only killed the buds but cracked the trees wide open . The freeze in the December previously simply caused the trees to lose their leaves . But the frost that followed in 1895 took the trees . It came South as far as Fort Myer . Out of this failure came Florida 's great success . Orange blossoms which the frost had failed to reach were brought to Flagler from the Everglades country . The same day came the offer of Mrs. Julia T. Tuttle of Cleveland to divide her 640 acre tract at Miami with Flagler if he would build from Palm Beach into that town . He accepted both challenges  --  Miami and the development of South Florida . He went immediately to Miami and accepted Mrs. Tuttle 's donation of alternate lots and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Palm Hotel and its park and in that day located all the railroad terminals . For those two lots that were thrown in to make the Royal Palm Hotel fifteen million dollars was recently refused . THE MIAMI LOCATION Miami stands today practically on those G40 acres . But the town owns 400 acres under water in the bay that in the future , in the development of the port , may be of more value than the half of Miami Mrs. Tuttle gave Flagler . The 65 acres already reclaimed by the town by filling in the shore front ranks with the most valuable land in the town . Miami faces east on Biscayne Bay which runs north and south for many miles behind Miami Beach and the islands or keys that separate the hay from the Atlantic and the Gulf Stream . The south line of the Miami business section is the Miami River . The Royal Palm Hotel holds the southeast corner of this section . Across the river is the Brickel estate which has grown rich from the sale of land for development ItIong the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami are now the lines of beautiful villas and gardens that make Miami shores famous over the world . Here are the beautiful estates of Deering and Matheson who together own the great key Biscayne directly across the bay . There Matheson has his unmatched groves of coconut as well as orchards of mango , avocado and guava . In a single nursery are 250,000 Kentia Palms . Many trees , shrubs and flowers are unmatched on this continent . The palms drop more than a hundred thousand coconuts every year on and around his 24 miles of motor road , and only his motors traverse those roads . Dr. Matheson has been spending his winters at Miami , or rather that part of it known as Coconut Grove for more than 20 years . but has owned five of the six miles of Key Biscayne for only 12 years . His hobby there is in developing trees and plants from seed . THE ENPANSION Some people who come to Miami view the new expanding harbor front and wonder at the narrow streets leading down thereto through the business section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresight of the telephone company 's experts or of anybody else that ever attempted to measure the future of Miami and Bay Biscayne . The South Atlantic Telephone Co. sold out to the Southern Bell in 1920 and the estimate in 1921 was that Miami might have 110,000 people by 1930 . Telephone experts later revised this estimate to a possibility of 130,000 people in Miami by 1930 . Plans were made accordingly . No telephone foundations were laid for such an expansion in population as has taken place . The telephone company may therefore be pardoned if it is five or six years behind . Newspapers may criticize the telephone company but newspapers here can not keep up with the growth . Here again is an illustration of the good and the bad in a boom land . ADVEICIISI NG A.NO NE SPAPER . BOOII Frank B. Shutts started the Miami Herald with $40 , - 000 , three-fourths of it borrowed . He still runs the largest law office in town with sixty men ; but spends half his time in conference with his associates of the Miami Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking press facilities to enable it to supply fully the out-of-town demand . It broke the world record laht year in advertising , carrying*43 million lines as compared with 31 million lines in the New York Times . The advertising rate is ten cents an agate line on the average , with a maximum of twelve cents . All the papers of Miami boom Miami and Florida . The land boom booms the papers that are largely filled with page advertisements of the hundred million dollar land " propositions " that surround the town . Again here is the good and the bad of it . For what population shall the telephone company lay its foundations ? On what basis shall newspapers expand their . press ' facilities when their main source of advertising is land development or offerings of lead for Mae ? The Miami Herald is-earning a million and a quarter per annum but must erect apartments for its employes . Hence , possibly We find Mr. Shutts one of the backers of the proposed Urmey-Arras at Coral Gables to cost twelve and a half million dollars and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the largest apartment structure in the world with its 1,855 rooms . THE DAILY NEWS TONVEIt Governor James M. Cox of Ohio , defeated for the Presidency by Senator Harding , knows no defeat in the newspaper world . Both Harding and Cox were leading publishers and editors in their respective towns in Ohio . The twenty-six-storied million dollar tower that houses the Miami Daily News of Governor Cox is located on the shore front and is the most beautiful structure among all the skyscrapers . Founded in 1922 the Daily News is the leading afternoon paper , but , like all the other papers  --  the Tab owned by Vanderbilt , the Tribune , and the Miami Herald  --  is for Miami and Florida only . If it were not for the excellent financial pages dealing with the New York stock market , the Curb , and the Chicago market , the Miami papers could not be called either national or international in their scope . They are , nevertheless , very interesting and readable papers . They are not heavy reading , but ' the News can boast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOUNDATIONS The two most solid things about Miami are at the top and bottom . The solid men of finance . the bankers , stand at the top as the administrators of civic affairs and the town itself rests upon 20 feet of sand . We have thus financial and physical health . Below the first layer of sand is coral rock and alternate layers of sand and rock succeed . " Build your house on the sand , " said a wise scientist . " Then you have drainage and health . " As South Florida grows , it may have serious drainage propositions . When on November 29 and 30 more than 15 inches of rain fell in 24 hours in Miami streets , the sands could not absorb it in a day . " What is that land over there ? " I asked my boating captain . " That , " he replied , " is high land . " " How high ? " " About five feet , " was the response . They will show you at Coral Gables the Seminole Indian burying ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . GOVERN:aux ' ' , BY FINANCE Edward Romfh , president of the First National Bank , has been Mayor since 1913 and has never sought an election . He is assisted by four other bankers , and under this board of commissioners Miami prospers . The citizens elect the five commissioners and they choose one of their number for Mayor . They hire engineers and administrators at twelve or fifteen thousand dollars a year and keep their eyes wide open to meet the needs of the growing town and its land and harbor expansion . A few years ago they took 1,500 feet of the waterfront for the town for $80,000 . It is worth millions today , if not invaluable in the development of the town . At the first city election there was a contest . At the next election there was some opposition and at tl-z last election there was no opposition . When Romfh first came in there was a debt of $800,000 . At the beginning of this year there was fourteen millions of bonds out and this month of February the citizens voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has recently absorbed the suburbs of Coconut Grove , Silver Bluff , Buena Vista , Lemon City and Little River . Miami must now be in population number one of the three leading cities of Florida which showed by the state census of a year ago Tampa 94,808 , Jacksonville 99,206 and Miami 71,419 . MIAMI DIVISIONS The lot on which the First National Bank now stands represents interesting history as to Miami values . It is in the heart of the business district at the corner of Northeast First Avenue and Flagler Street , which street runs east and west , bisecting the town into north and south divisions . Addresses in Miami are very easily placed . The streets run east and west and the avenues north and south . Miami Avenue divides the town into east and west . The city is thus cut into four divisions  --  northeast and southwest and northwest and southeast and with the letters of one of these four divisions and with the number of the street or avenue , a location at Miami is quickly visualized . Roinfh says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only foolish people would tear up alligator and mangrove swamps and pour in sand . The East Coast railway over the Florida Keys was always known as Flagler 's folly during his lifetime and it was then everywhere considered that his millions had been wasted . VELISKAISLE ' VALVES " A friend of mine bought over three miles of Palm . Beach for almost nothing  --  ten or twelve thousand dol : tars or less . I asked him what he was going to do with such worthless land  --  would he raise rabbits , mosquitoes , alligators or skunks . He said it would be worth money some time . The land was really worth about as much , when he bought it , as the forty acres the man in Arkansas sold the man from the North . The seller later declared , ' I put one over on that fellow for I deeded to him also the other forty acres . ' " My friend later got a million dollars for a mile and a half of the worthless Palm Beach and then he sold Flagler one-half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was here in Miami in 1895 and when I came back later and they offered me a lot for a thousand dollars I inquired how many acres there was in the lot . I was astonished when they told me it was one-fifth of an acre . " In my youth I could buy all the land I wanted at Miami Beach ut twelve cents an acre . Now they sell business property there at New York prices .
