" Food won the war ; but it means getting loyalty and co-operation from every kitchen . . . . <P> " Do you remember meatless days ? So , too , we can have cocktail-less parties . You may say that was war-time sacrifice , and the average citizen wo n't sacrifice his desires in peace times . Of course , peace patriotism is harder , but it is not impossible . <P> " Herbert Hoover carries no timidity of defeat in his heart . He has the amazing spiritual leadership to make each law-abiding household want to do its bit . Governor Smith says it ca n't be done . With Herbert Hoover we know it CAN be done ! " <P> Thus , a third time , did Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , Assistant Attorney-General of the U. S. , do-her-bit for Hooverism before an audience of Ohio Protestants . The evening after delivering her message to the Methodists at Lorain ( TIME , Oct. 1 ) , she visited a Presbyterian men 's club at Warren . A long quotation about Tammany Hall corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had looked it up in the Encyclopaedia Britannica . She cried : <P> " Of course , Tammany 's Governor may be equal to the task of reforming Tammany , but I want to say far above a whisper that I doubt it ! " <P> It was very effective speech-making and most of the Presbyterian gentlemen of Warren , Ohio , went home shaking their heads about cocktails and parties and Tammany and all the rest . <P> But there were frowns and scowls and even growls among the " practical " element of the G. O. P. Senator Moses , himself no scorner of cocktails , said he had received " plenty " of letters protesting about Worker Willebrandt . The arch-Democratic New York World turned , of course , from anger to glee and redoubled its editorial sniping at " Mabel " and " sectarianism . " More serious was a cartoon published broadcast by the pro-Hoover Scripps-Howard newspaper chain , showing a church daubed with " Politix " and the G. O. P. spanking a naughty child . The caption was " Give this little girl a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Committeeman Maurice Maschke said she was " misguided . " In wet New Jersey , Senator Walter Evans Edge assured the public that Mrs. Willebrandt would make no visit there . From wet Wisconsin to wet headquarters in wet Chicago went a letter from Benjamin Fuelleman , a State committeeman . " Unless Mrs. Willebrandt is muzzled , " wrote Mr. Fuelleman , " Mr. Hoover is sure to go down to defeat . ... If she fails to do this return to Washington , be silent , President Coolidge should call for her resignation . . . . We can not do it if we have to carry around ' an old man of the sea ' such as Mrs. Willebrandt has proven herself . " <P> Walter Jodok Kohler , the G. O. P. 's gubernatorial nominee in Wisconsin , sped to Washington to see Nominee Hoover . What he said about Mrs. Willebrandt was not revealed . Newsgatherers plagued Dr. Hubert Work , the G. 0 . P. 's chief spokesman . This colloquy ensued . <P> Q. What is Mrs. Willebrandt 's status ? ... <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . She is a sort of free lance . . . . <P> Q. Do you approve of the speeches she has made ? <P> Dr. W. . . . I have not read them all and so I can not answer . <P> Q. You will find them very interesting .
