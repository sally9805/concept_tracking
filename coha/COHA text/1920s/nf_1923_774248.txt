txt  | eccentric orbit ; and Schiaparelli has shown that a hippopede 12 ? in length ( the mean inequality is 6 ? ) would only be twice 9 ' in breadth , so that the improved theory of the moon was quite as good as any of the other planetary theories , as long as the evection or second lunar inequality had not been discovered . While the system of concentric spheres was thus made more perfect by Kalippus , so that it could better save the phenomena ' ( i.e. account for the observed facts ) , it was fully accepted by his great contemporary , Aristotle ( 384-322 ) . According to him , the universe is spherical , because the sphere is the most perfect body , and as the quickest motion is the most perfect , the outermost sphere ( that of the fixed stars ) is the most perfect sphere of all and is the seat of unchangeable order . It is under the immediate influence of the primary divine cause of motion , which from the circumference extends its power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short account of the system of Eudoxus and Kalippus . To him the spheres are not merely representatives of mathematical formulae , but physically existing parts of a vast machinery by which the celestial bodies are kept in motion . He is therefore obliged to introduce a number of extra spheres to prevent the motion of the outer spheres from being transmitted to the inner ones . Notwithstanding the great authority of Aristotle , the modified system of concentric spheres could , however , not hold its own among people who had a more detailed knowledge of the motions of the planets . But his ideas about the immutability of all bodies in the aethereal region ' and his theory that comets originated in the upper parts of the atmosphere continued to prevail for nearly two thousand years . The great difficulty in accepting the system of concentric spheres was that according to it every planet must  | always be at the same distance from the earth . But how could that- possibly be the case , when every planet was seen to vary very considerably in brightness ? Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun ; did that not indicate that they were at that time much nearer to us than when they were nearer the sun and much fainter ? Similarly Venus and Mercury attained their greatest brightness at a certain angular distance from the sun . How could they be attached to a sphere , in the centre of which the earth was situated ? It is therefore not to be wondered at that other ways were sought of saving the phenomena ' , and this was already done by a contemporary of Aristotle , Herakleides of Pontus . His mind must have been singularly free from preconceived notions , since he accepted the doctrine held by some of the later Pythagoreans , that the earth turns on its axis once in twenty-four hours from west to east , thereby producing the apparent rotation of the heavens in the opposite direction . And Herakleides went even farther . There had been considerable difference of opinion among philosophers as to whether Mercury and Venus were nearer to us than the sun or farther off . It almost looked , judging by their changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the near side of the sun and sometimes beyond the sun . This , in connexion with the fact that they are never seen at any great distance from the sun , made Herakleides realize that Mercury and Venus move round the sun and not round the earth . Unfortunately all his writings are lost , so that all we know of his doctrines is derived from the allusions of much later writers . We have therefore no evidence as to whether Herakleides took another step forward and suggested that the other three planets also travelled round the sun . A certain passage in a lost  | book by Geminus ( about 8o B.C. ) quoted by the commentator Simplicius ( about A.D. 500 ) has been interpreted by Schiaparelli as hinting that Herakleides even let the earth go round the sun . But not only is the passage in question strongly suspected of being corrupt , it is also contradicted by positive statements that Herakleides placed the earth in the middle and let it move not progressively but in a turning manner ' . But about fifty years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indubitably advanced by Aristarchus of Samos , who flourished about 28o B.C. In his case we are not dependent on the testimony of uncritical compilers ; our authorities are Archimedes and Plutarch . The former tells us that Aristarchus published the hypothesis ' that the earth is carried round the sun in a circle , and that the sphere of the fixed stars is of such a size that this motion does not produce apparent displacements among the stars in the course of a year . Plutarch , in his little book On the face in the disc of the moon ' , says that Aristarchus in order to save the phenomena supposed that the heavens stand still and the earth moves in an oblique circle at the same time as it turns round its axis ' . In another of his writings Plutarch mentions that Aristarchus and Seleukus ( a Babylonian geographer of the second century B.C. ) held that the earth rotates , the former supposing it only , but the latter affirming it as true . But what can have made Aristarchus think that the earth travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this fine idea , which had to lie dormant for eighteen hundred years ? Simplicius , after alluding to the great brightness of Mars when in opposition to the sun and to the changes of the apparent diameter of the moon , which made the system of concentric spheres untenable , says that as-  | tronomers therefore introduced the hypothesis of eccentric circles and epicycles , if indeed the hypothesis of eccentrics was not already invented by the Pythagoreans , as stated by Nikomachus . This late writer 's testimony is not worth much as regards the origin of the system of movable eccentrics ; but that the latter was invented before the epicyclic theory is very probable indeed , and it is easy to see how the statement of Simplicius indicates the manner in which the way was prepared for the hypothesis of Aristarchus . To the Greek mind a heavenly body could not possibly move in any other curve than a circle . And as Mars was evidently nearest to us when in opposition , it followed that Mars must move on a circle which was eccentric to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle lay somewhere on the straight line through the earth and the sun . Obviously this was not a fixed line , but one which turned round one of its extremities ; consequently the centre of the orbit of Mars described a circle round the earth in a year , and everything would be explained by assuming that Mars moved round the eccentric circle from east to west in a period equal to its synodic revolution , that is , the interval between two successive oppositions ( two years and fifty days ) . Jupiter and Saturn moved similarly on movable eccentrics . We can not doubt that this system was known to Aristarchus . He must also have been acquainted with the hypothesis of Herakleides , that the centres of the orbits of Mercury and Venus lay in the sun . What then could be simpler than to assume that the centres of the orbits of the three outer planets not only lay somewhere on a line passing through the sun , but coincided with the sun ? And having got so far , Aristarchus must have been struck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he took one step farther , and instead of letting the sun , centre  | of all the planetary orbits , go round the earth , let the earth go round the sun , leaving everything else unaltered . This must have been the way in which Aristarchus was led to his brilliant hypothesis . But why did nobody accept it ? The few and scanty references to it by classical authors prove that it can never have been favourably received . We learn from Plutarch that Kleanthes the Stoic held that Aristarchus of Samos ought to be accused of impiety for moving the hearth of the world ' ; but prejudice of that kind can hardly have prevented the new hypothesis from being a success . But the Greece of the third century B.C. was very different from the aggregate of small city-states to which the poets and philosophers had addressed their works during the preceding two hundred and fifty years . Philosophical speculation had flourished there , and had been thought sufficient to solve the problems of the universe . But now the conquests of Alexander the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Hellenic culture and yet not severed from their own ancient civilization . A wider outlook ensued , and it was realized that only if based on accurately observed facts could scientific theory have a chance of succeeding . At the newly founded Museum of Alexandria observations began to be made , and it can not long have escaped attention that just as the sun 's apparent motion was not uniform ( a fact perhaps neglected by Aristarchus ) , so also were the motions of the planets subject to inequalities . These were less conspicuous than those depending on the planet 's distance from the sun , which the hypothesis of Aristarchus accounted for so well , but they could not be explained merely by assuming that the earth went round the sun . Thus the beautifully simple idea of Aristarchus fell to the ground . The aim of mathematicians by degrees became to find  | combinations of circular motion which would represent more or less closely the observed place of a planet at any time and give the means of finding this place by computation beforehand , without insisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of nearly four hundred years the theory of planetary motions , which eventually became known as the Ptolemaic system , was developed , so far as we know , solely by Apollonius ( 23o B.C. ) , Hipparchus ( 13o B.c. ) and Ptolemy ( A.D. 140 ) . Apollonius does not seem to have left any writings on astronomy ; most of the writings of Hipparchus are lost , and Ptolemy in his great work on astronomy gives very little historical information about his predecessors . We therefore know very little about the gradual development of the Ptolemaic System . Ptolemy however describes at some length the two ways in which the motions of the three outer planets could be represented . We have already given a short account of the earlier of the two systems , that of movable eccentrics . In the first figure the larger circle is the orbit of a planet P , which travels round it in the synodic period from east to west , while the centre C in a year describes the smaller circle round T , the earth , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable to Mercury and Venus , and it did not illustrate the stationary points and retrograde motions as clearly as the system of epicycles did . The latter therefore soon drove it from the field altogether . In the second figure T is the earth , round which the point C performs a revolution in the period in which the planet travels round the heavens , for Saturn 29 years , for Jupiter nearly 12 years , for Mars 687 days . For Venus and Mercury the period is a sidereal year ( the line TC always pointing to the sun ) , and this is also the period in which one of the three outer planets moves round the epicycle ( the smaller circle ) in the same direction from west to east . For the two inner planets the revolution on the epicycle takes place in the synodic period . The apparent motion of the planet as seen from T is therefore the resultant of two motions . When the planet reaches the point a , determined by lay being to Ta in the ratio of the two linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a short time be equal and opposite , so that the planet is stationary . After that the motion becomes retrograde as seen from T. This lasts until the planet reaches , 3 , after which the planet again becomes stationary for a little while and then resumes its ordinary direct motion . It is evidently possible to fix the ratio of the radii of the two circles so that the observed length of the retrograde arc corresponds exactly to that given by the theory . The line TC always points towards the sun , and the planet is in opposition to the sun when it is at  | or nearest to the earth , and in conjunction with the sun when at p . It is also possible by means of an epicycle to represent the motion of a body which like the sun and moon moves with a somewhat variable velocity without ever becoming stationary or retrograde . In this case the motion on the epicycle has to be in the opposite direction to that of the motion on the larger  | circle , or deferent as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the result is the same whether we employ the movable eccentric or the concentric deferent with an epicycle to account for the motion of one of the outer planets is shown in the figure . The dotted circles represent the former theory , the others the deferent and epicycle , and it is necessary to make the radii cP and TC equal and also Tc=CP . But as already stated , the movable eccentric theory soon disappeared . What we have here described in outline had most probably been reached before the time of Hipparchus . He was a native of Nicaea , but spent most of his time at Rhodes . He was able to make use of observations made at Alexandria in the previous 150 years , and by means of them he made his great discovery of the Precession of the Equinoxes , whereby the longitudes of all stars increase at the rate of 50 " per annum . He was also himself an indefatigable observer , and prepared a catalogue of the positions of about 85o stars , which unfortunately has been lost . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Babylonia centuries before the foundation of the Museum of Alexandria , and this enabled him to determine the orbits of sun and moon  | more accurately . In the case of the sun it was easy enough , since the unequal length of the four seasons was the only inequality to be accounted for ; and this could be done either by a simple eccentric circle or by an epicycle . The same was the case with the moon , but matters were here somewhat more complicated , as the nodes ( or points of intersection of the moon 's orbit and the apparent orbit of the sun ) travel from east to west right round the heavens in about 182 years , a fact which , as we have seen , had already been taken into account by Eudoxus . In addition to this the line of apsides ( points of greatest and least distance of the moon ) move round the heavens from west to east in nearly nine years , which was accounted for by making the motion on the deferent about 3 ? per revolution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors had only furnished him with observations of eclipses , Hipparchus could only produce a theory of the moon 's motion which represented that motion at new and full moon sufficiently well . He noticed that observations of the moon about the time of first or last quarter sometimes did not agree with his theory , but he had to leave the investigation of this to his successors . Similarly in the case of the five planets , want of observations prevented him from making any advance . The epicyclic system received its last development in the second century from Claudius Ptolemy , who embodied his predecessors ' and his own work in a great book called the Mathematical Syntaxis . In addition to a catalogue of 1,025 stars , it discusses the motions of the sun , moon , and planets . In the theory of the moon he made very substantial improvements by discovering the second inequality , now known as the evection ( dimly suspected by Hipparchus ) , and fixing its amount at 1 ? 191 ' , very near its true value . To allow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to move on an eccentric circle , but further complications had to be  | introduced in the theory , which must be passed over here . Ptolemy had also to add a somewhat similar complication to the planetary theory of Apollonius to account for the apparent irregularity which we now know to be caused by a planet moving in an elliptic orbit with variable velocity . He introduced a punctum aequans ' , so situated on the line of apsides that the earth was midways between it and the centre of the deferent . The line from the equant to the centre of the epicycle moved so that it described equal angles in equal times . Even this was not enough for the planet Mercury , the theory of whose motion was still more complicated . As a ready means of computing the movements of sun , moon , and planets , the Ptolemaic ' system is deserving of the highest praise . By its authors it was certainly not intended to represent the actually existing state of the heavenly bodies . For it could not possibly have escaped Hipparchus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations of the moon 's distance , and thereby of its apparent diameter , which never happened in reality . Owing to the state of algebra at that time , geometry had to be pressed into the service of astronomy , just as Euclid had to adopt a geometrical representation when dealing with irrational quantities or the theory of proportion . But the truth , that is the Copernican system , lay hidden all the time among the deferents and epicycles of the Greek mathematicians . We can reproduce Ptolemy 's values of the ratio of the radii of epicycle and deferent from the semi-axis major of each planet expressed in units of that of the earth as shown in the following table : Table  | But for more than fourteen hundred years the idea of Aristarchus remained dormant and unrecognized , and the Ptolemaic system was almost universally accepted . All the same , the system was totally at variance with Aristotelean Physics , the adherents of which objected strongly to the movements around points outside the centre of the world . Attempts had therefore been made even before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the deferent was assumed to be concentric with the earth , the epicycle might be supposed to be the equator of a solid sphere , rolling between two solid concentric spheres . This idea , which is described by Theon of Smyrna ( soon after A.D. 100 ) , became insufficient as soon as the deferents became eccentric circles . In the Syntaxis Ptolemy ignores it , but in a later work , the Hypotheses of the Planets , or rather in the second book of it , he sets forth a development of the system described by Theon . The epicycle sphere now fits between two eccentric spherical surfaces ( an inner and an outer one ) , near the common centre of which the earth is situated . This theory of the world , which its author made as elaborate in its way as the epicyclic system , was not a success . The Greek original is lost , but an Arabic translation of the second book of Hypotheses has been preserved and has some years ago become more accessible through a German translation . This and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern minds , and throughout the Middle Ages various combinations of spheres were proposed by some Mohammedan philosophers , who could not feel satisfied with the Ptolemaic system of circles . This was particularly the case in Spain , and was connected with the rise of Aristotelean philosophy in that country . From Spain the fight between the circles and the spheres spread to Paris and to Oxford , and it was not until about the  | year 1300 that the system of epicycles was finally victorious . Thus the Syntaxis of Ptolemy remains the acme of Greek astronomy . Whatever may be said against the Ptolemaic system of the world as being apparently complicated and difficult to believe in , it must be conceded that from a mathematical point of view it was perfect . It gave the means of computing tables of the movements of the planets , which supplied positions not differing too much from those observed with the imperfect instruments then available , except after long periods of time . It might even have been further developed , when observations had shown the necessity for doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a series of sines or cosines of multiples of certain angles . It was worthy of the great minds by whom it was started , in the days when Greek social development and intellectual life were at their best ; and of those who completed it , when Greece and the Hellenized countries had become parts of an Empire embracing most of the known world and giving its citizens opportunities for extended activities far beyond what the small Greek city-states had been able to offer . Footnote  | THE DARK AGES AND THE DAWN CHARLES SINGER The Limits of the Middle Ages of Science THE task that falls to the writer on the Middle Ages in such a volume as this might be deemed far from attractive . The epoch , by general admission , presents us with a set-back in the development of scientific ideas . During the period between the fall of the Empire and the revolution in physics carried through by Galileo in the seventeenth century , the conceptions as to the nature of the world in which they lived that prevailed among educated men was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because these views were finally shattered by Galileo and his successors that many of the authors whose works we shall have to discuss may seem insignificant . Yet some of these men , who are now well-nigh forgotten , have had their share in determining the current of human thought and with it the course of human destiny . The test of importance that we must apply is not our assent to their opinions but the influence their work has had on the period we are considering . We shall remember too that the period has the intense interest of presenting us with the beginning of something , the birth ? or rebirth ? of the scientific idea . We can not , then , pass over in silence the millennium that intervenes between antiquity and modernity . There is a continuity in the history of the human intellect , for civilization is a unique phenomenon and there is no real evidence that it has occurred more than once  | in the world 's history . To understand our own version of civilization we must trace it back to its origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages . It is beside the point to urge that the Middle Ages contributed little to the actual sum of knowledge of the external world . What we want to know is why they contributed so little , and how , contributing so little , they yet succeeded in passing on to our time the basic ideas from which science has grown . These Middle Ages , after all , were not a thousand years of cataclysm . They represent doubtless a deterioration of the human mind , but the nature and causes of that deterioration are themselves the subject of intense scientific interest . The Middle Ages can no more be disregarded in considering the general course of science than can a degenerate or parasitic series of plants or animals be passed over when considering the larger group to which they belong and from which they have sprung . The very degeneracy of such a series has an interest of its own , and often , by helping us to exclude accidental elements , enables us to detect essential traits of the group which we might otherwise overlook . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period with which we are concerned . Without attempting to define science , we may describe it as the process of making knowledge . Being a process it must also involve the idea of progress or at least of movement . The world of science is a dynamic world with its own stores of ever-acting energy . The world of the mediaeval thinker was a static one , a world in which such forces as were acting were impressed from without . When and how was this static element introduced ? We may first consider the terminus a quo of the mediaeval attitude toward the external world . The Middle Ages begin for science at that period when the ancients ceased  | to make knowledge . Now , ancient science can be clearly traced as an active process up to the end of the second century of the Christian era . Galen , one of the very greatest and most creative biologists of all time , died A. D. 201 . Ptolemy , one of the greatest of the cosmographers , was his older contemporary . After Galen and Ptolemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the longest , but with the mathematician Theon of Alexandria , who died about 400 , we part altogether with the impulse of the science of antiquity . Stoicism and Neoplatonism too , the chief systems of thought of the late Empire , are dying and are giving place to that great philosophical and religious movement , the repercussion of which is felt right through the Middle Ages and down to our own time . The standpoint of its great protagonists , Tertullian ( 155 ? 222 ) , Lactantius ( 260 ? 340 ) , and , above all , St. Jerome ( 34o ? 420 ) and St. Augustine ( 354 ? 430 ) , is outside the department with which we have here to deal , but it was assuredly not conducive to the exact study and record of phenomena . We may fix the end of Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages for science at the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century . The terminus ad quern of mediaeval science is , perhaps , less easy to determine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the action of which the human mind , failing to increase the stock of phenomenal knowledge , sank slowly into an increasing ineptitude . At a certain point the nadir of mental deterioration was reached and intellectual competence tended again upward . The time of lowest degradation of the human intellect varied according to the state of civilization in different parts of Europe . It was probably most general about the tenth century . After this may be  | discerned a slow ascent . Later , in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , we encounter considerable extension of natural knowledge . There is still , however , no widespread acceptance of the ancient view that had been voiced by the philosopher Seneca ( 3 B.C. ? A.D. 65 ) that knowledge may be indefinitely extended . That view appears to be an essential element in any effective doctrine of progress . In the scholastic period , however , there do at last appear a very few forward-looking minds such as that of Roger Bacon ( 1214 ? 1294 ) , but they are as yet very rare and exceptional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanism we encounter a larger number of forward-looking thinkers , but they are still isolated . Not until the sixteenth century is there any effort , at once organized and conscious , to translate into action this new-born hope in the future . It is only in the early years of the seventeenth century that the hope obtains formal philosophical expression once more with Francis Bacon ( 1561 ? 1626 ) and Rene Descartes ( 1596-1650 ) . By that time , however , not only are the Middle Ages past but they are so much forgotten that the reading public needs skilled interpreters to explain the mediaeval point of view . If we have to name a year for the end-point of mediaeval science we would select 1543 . In that year appeared two fundamental modern works based on the experimental method , the De fabrica corporis humani of the Belgian Andreas Vesalius ( 1514 ? 1564 ) and the De revolutionibus orbium caelestium of the Pole Nicholas Copernicus ( 1473-1543 ) . It is true that for generations before 1543 there was a dawning consciousness of the inadequacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was vague and ill-expressed , and of the nature rather of mental discomfort than of intellectual revolt . It is also true that for some generations after the time of  | Vesalius and Copernicus the characteristic doctrines of the science of the Middle Ages were almost universally taught in the schools . Such doctrines , too , were still diffused by literature , and are , for instance , displayed in the writings of Shakespeare . But the ideas on which the works of Vesalius and Copernicus had been based gain , from this time onward , an ever wider hearing . The year 1543 saw for the first time two published authoritative works that formally rejected the old views . These works , though produced by men who had steeped themselves in the old system , yet provided a new standpoint . For science , then , 1543 is the natural terminus ad quem of the Middle Ages . Now , since the human mind turned on its upward course after the tenth century , and since the process was accelerated during the great scholastic period of the thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , it may be asked , why should we not choose one or other of these dates as the end-point of the scientific Middle Ages ? The thirteenth century , the epoch of consolidation of Catholic philosophy , has been selected as one of exceptional enlightenment , and has been specially exalted by those who lay great emphasis on the continuing role of the Church in the development of the intellectual system of our modern world . There are , therefore , some who would place the division in the thirteenth rather than in the sixteenth century . There are yet others , biassed perhaps by the literary training of the classics , who would place the cleavage about the year 1400 . They would make the Revival of Learning , and especially of Greek letters , the basis of the differentiation between mediaeval and modern . Yet to make the great division at any such date as 1000 , 1200 , or 1400 would be an error , because , with very few exceptions , the point of view of the eleventh-century  | encyclopaedist , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally and essentially an effort to return to the past . It was the literature and language of antiquity , the antiquity of the fathers , of the philosophers , or of the poets , that these men sought more or less vainly to revive . In an encyclopaedia of the eleventh century nothing can be found that is not derived from patristic sources . The great Catholic scholastics of the thirteenth century believed that they were reconstructing the philosophy of Aristotle . Few first-hand students of that great man of science will now be found to agree with the interpretation supplied by them . It is true that , despite the errors of philosophical interpretation , scientific elements are not wholly wanting in scholastic writings . Yet in that age the infinity of the knowable universe was passionately denied , originality of view was furtively hidden under the cloak of authority , and knowledge ? so the knowers claimed ? was always based on the wisdom of antiquity . Imitation rather than origination was the characteristic mental attitude also of the most enthusiastic scholars of the fifteenth century . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient texts were recovered , though it may rightly be regarded as containing scientific elements , had for its motive the imitation of the past by the present , rather than the modern archaeological aim of the mental reconstruction of the past with the object of understanding the present . The ablest writers of the time sought to become the apes of Cicero ' . What is true of the literary studies of the Renaissance is just as true of the scientific studies of the period . The rescue of the Greek texts , though it enlarged the mental horizon , chained men 's minds more closely than ever to the past . Even the revolt against the ' Arabists ' , led with such enthusiasm by the  | classical scholars , had for its object a yet closer return to antiquity . There is a point , however , at which those interested in phenomena ? the physicists , and especially the physicians ? show a general willingness to turn their gaze from the past and toward the future . We may at least say of the two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in that their authors are looking to the future for the development and vindication of their views . The work of the aged Copernicus , though not published till 1543 , had been prepared many years before . It is therefore much the more conservative of the two , and still bears marks of the Middle Ages on every page . Vesalius , on the other hand , when he published his magnificently printed and illustrated Fabrica was a vigorous young man of but twenty-eight . Only four years earlier he had produced a treatise which , while rejecting the anatomical views of the Arabists , had expressed full faith in the complete reliability of Galen . His conversion had been rapid , and now he parts definitely with the Middle Ages . As an anatomical observer he has become independent . His physiological theory , however , is still based on Galen just as surely as the circular orbits ascribed by Copernicus to the planets are derived from Aristotle . With Copernicus and Vesalius , however , organized and systematic observation had found her place . Fabricius ab Aquapendente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 1601 ) in Astronomy did but practise a method which their two great predecessors had formally initiated . But for the process of free generalization on such observation and for the effective wielding of the new weapon of experiment the world had still to wait for the generation of Galileo ( 1564 ? 1642 ) , Kepler ( 1571-1630 ) , and Harvey ( 1576 ? 1657 )  | 2 . The Dark Age Thus for effective purposes we may place the limits of the mediaeval attitude towards nature between the years 400 and 1543 , with a debatable period of another half century up to 1600 . This vast stretch of time is divided by an event of the highest importance for the history of the human intellect . Between the beginning of the tenth and the end of the twelfth century there was a remarkable outburst of intellectual activity in Western Islam . This movement reacted with great effect on Latin Europe , and especially on its views of nature , by means of works which gradually reached Christendom in translations from the Arabic . In the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediaeval period into three parts , an earlier Dark Age , an intermediate Age of Arabian Influence , and a later Scholastic Age . The Age of Arabian Influence may itself be conveniently sub-divided into an earlier period of Arabian Infiltration and a later one of Arabian Translation . During all these periods the general beliefs as to the nature of the external world hardly change , but the difference in presentment of the material is such that the mediaevalist need seldom be in doubt into which category to place any document from these centuries treating of a scientific topic . The task of the first mediaeval period was the conveyance of the remains of the ancient wisdom to later ages . During the closing centuries of the classical decline , the literature that was to be conveyed had been delimited and translated into Latin , the only language common to the learned West . We may briefly discuss this classical Heritage . The work of Plato that is least attractive and most obscure to the modern mind fitted in well with the prevalent views of the Neoplatonists . The commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third century from a translation by Apuleius in the second , presents the basis of views held throughout the entire Middle Ages on the nature of the universe and of man . Thus the Timaeus became one of the most influential of all the works of antiquity , and especially it carried the central dogma of mediaeval science , the doctrine of the macrocosm and microcosm . Of Aristotle there survived only the Categories and the De interpretatione , translated in the sixth century by Boethius ( 480-524 ) . A Greek introduction to the Categories had been prepared by Porphyry in the second century , and this also was rendered into Latin by Boethius . Thus the only Aristotelian writings known to the Dark Age of science were the logical works , and these determined the main extra-theological interest for many centuries . It is a world-misfortune that Boethius did not see his way to prepare versions of those works of the Peripatetic school that display powers of observation . Had a translation of Aristotle 's Histoyia animalium or De generatione animalium survived , or had a Latin version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages , the whole mental history of the race might have been different . Boethius repaired the omission , to some small extent , by handing on certain mathematical treatises of his own compilation , the De institutione arithmetica , the De institutione musica , and the ( doubtful ) Geometrica . These works preserved throughout the darkest centuries some fragment of mathematical knowledge . Thanks to them we can at least say that during the long degradation of the human intellect , mathematics , the science last to sink with the fall of the Greek intellect , was not dragged down quite so low as the other departments of knowledge . The main gift of Boethius to the world , his De consolatione philo-  | sophiae , which preserved some classical taste and feeling , lies outside our field . A somewhat similar service to that of Boethius was rendered by Macrobius ( 395 ? 423 ) and by Martianus Capella ( c. 500 ) . The latter , especially in his Satyricon , provided the Dark Age with a complete encyclopaedia . The work is divided into nine books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clumsy style , of the marriage of the god Mercury to the nymph Philology . Of the last seven books of the work , each contains an account of one of the Liberal Arts ' , grammar , dialectic , rhetoric , geometry , arithmetic , astronomy , and music , a classification of studies that dates back to Varro ( 116 ? 27 B. c. ) and was retained throughout the Middle Ages . The section on Astronomy has a passage containing a heliocentric view of the universe , a view that had been familiar to certain earlier Greek astronomers . The cosmology of Capella , like that of Chalcidius , is Neoplatonic , as is also the work of Macrobius , whose commentary on the Somnium Scipionis of Cicero gave rise to some of the most prevalent cosmological conceptions of the first mediaeval period . In addition to the little cosmography , mathematics , and astronomy that could be gleaned from such writings as these , the Dark Age inherited a group of scientific and medical works from the period of classical decline . By far the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. D. 23-79 ) , which deeply influenced the early encyclopaedists . Somewhat akin to it are the Quaestiones naturales of the moralist Seneca ( 3 B.C.-A.D. 65 ) , whose ethical attitude toward phenomena delighted many mediaeval writers by whom he was taken for a Christian . Very curious and characteristic is a group of later pseudepigrapha bearing the names of Dioscorides , Hippocrates , and Apuleius . These works were probably all  | prepared or at least translated between the fourth and sixth centuries . They provided much of the medical equipment of the Dark Age . Such material , then , was the basis of ' the mediaeval scientific heritage . Traces of it are encountered in De Institutionibus divinarum et humanayum liteyayum of Cassiodorus ( 490-585 ) , perhaps the earliest general writer whose works bear the authentic mediaeval stamp . The scientific heritage is , however , much more fully displayed in the Origines of Isidore of Seville , a late sixth-century work which formed a cyclopaedia of all the sciences in the form of an explanation of the terms proper to each . For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isidore ( 56o-636 ) , Bede ( 673-735 ) , Alcuin ( 735-804 ) , Rabanus Maurus ( 776-856 ) , who borrow from one another successively and all from Pliny , may be said to contain the natural knowledge of the Dark Age . These writers are summarized by the early eleventh-century English writer Byrhtferth ( died c. 1020 ) , whose copious commentary on Bede may be regarded as the final product of the nature-knowledge of the Dark Age . With this somewhat belated author we part company with the Dark Age and enter upon a new period , with new forces and new movements at work . ? 3 . The Age of Arabian Infiltration The tenth century and those that follow bring us into relation with the wisdom of the East . In these centuries the relation of East and West with which we are nowadays familiar is reversed . In our time most Oriental peoples recognize the value of Western culture , and give it the sincerest form of flattery . The Oriental recognizes that with the Occident are science and learning , power and organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West does not extend to the sphere of religion . The Oriental who nowadays gladly accepts the Occidental as his judge , his physician , or his teacher , wholly repudiates , and perhaps despises , his religion . In the Europe of the tenth , eleventh , and twelfth centuries it was far otherwise . The Westerner knew full well that Islam held the learning and science of antiquity . His proficiency in arms and administration had been more than sufficiently proved ? the Occidental belief in them is enshrined in our Semitic words arsenal ' and admiral ' . There was a longing , too , for the intellectual treasures of the East , but the same fear and repugnance to its religion that the East now feels for Western religion . And the Western experienced obstacles in obtaining the desired Oriental learning analogous to those now encountered by the Eastern in the Occident . The earliest definitely Oriental influence that we can discern as affecting ideas about nature is of the character of infiltration rather than direct translation . The literary first agents of this process appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . Such influence can be traced in two works in the Hebrew language by Sabbatai ben Abraham ben Joel ( 913-982 ) , better known as Donnolo , a Jew of Otranto who practised medicine at Rossano in Southern Italy . Donnolo learnt Arabic while a prisoner in Saracen hands ; he was taught the language by a native of Bagdad , and , like Constantine the African in the next century , claimed to have studied the sciences of the Greeks , Arabs , Babylonians , and Indians ' . He travelled in the Italian peninsula in search of learning , and must thus have spread some of his Arabic science . His most important work , known as the Book of Creation , is dated to the year 946 . It is a mystical treatise of great historical and philological interest and involves a knowledge of astrology . It unquestionably draws on Arabic  | sources , and sets forth fully the ancient doctrine encountered in the Timaeus of the macrocosm and microcosm or parallelism between the external world of nature and the internal world of man 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The earliest Latin document exhibiting Oriental influence is a treatise on astrology to which the name Alchandrus ' ( Alexander ? ) is attached . This work has come down to us in a manuscript written about 950 or a little later , probably in Southern France . The repeated use of Hebrew and Arabic equivalents for the names of constellations and planets , and the occasional use of Hebrew script , leave no doubt that it also is of Jewish origin . The existence of these works enables us to understand the Oriental influence in the mathematical writings of the learned Pope Silvester II ( Gerbert , d. 1003 ) , who spent some years in Northern Spain , where Jews are known to have acted as intermediaries between Moslems and Christians . Gerbert was , perhaps , among the earliest to introduce the Arabic system of numbering , which slowly replaced the much clumsier Roman system , with its tiresome use of the abacus for simple mathematical processes . He is also believed to have instigated a translation from the Arabic of a work on the Astrolabe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life at the Benedictine abbey of Reichenau in Switzerland . He wrote certain mathematical and astrological works which were extensively used in the following century . Hermann was unable to read Arabic , and could not travel by reason of his infirmity . Yet his writings display much Oriental influence , which was almost certainly conveyed to him by wandering scholars of the type of Donnolo and Alchandrus ' . Similar though somewhat belated evidence of the influence of what we have called the process of  | Arabic infiltration is exhibited in the lapidary of Marbod of Anjou , Bishop of Rennes ( 1035-1123 ) , and in the extremely widely read work on the medicinal use of herbs , probably composed by Odo of Meune , Abbot of Beauprai ( Macer Floridus , d. 1161 ) . The Arabic learning thus beginning to trickle through to the West in a much corrupted form was , however , by no means an entirely native Saracen product ; it was derived ultimately from Greek work . There was , indeed , yet one channel by which the original Greek wisdom might still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East was very little in evidence in the centuries with which we are now concerned , but a Greek tradition still lingered in certain Southern Italian centres , and especially in Sicily . South Italy and Sicily remained for centuries under the ' nominal suzerainty of Byzantium , and the dialects of the island bear traces to this very day of the Greek spoken there and in Calabria and Apulia until late mediaeval times . But the Saracens had begun their attacks on Sicily as early as the eighth century , and their rule did not cease until the Norman conquest of the eleventh century . The Semitic language of the Saracens left the same impress on the island as did their art and architecture , so that between the tenth and twelfth centuries Sicily is a source of both Greek and Arabic learning for Western Europe . One seat of learning in the Southern Italian area felt especially early the influence of the Graeco-Arabic culture . Salerno , on the Gulf of Naples , had been a medical centre as far back as the ninth century . It is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , some traces of ancient Greek medicine lingered in Latin translation widely diffused in Magna Graecia during the centuries that succeeded the downfall of the Western Empire . Such learning as remained was galvanized into  | life by Saracenic energy and , with what we know of the carrying agents of Arabic culture , it is easy to understand the tradition that attributes the founding of the great medical school of Salerno to the co-operation of a Greek , an Arab , a Latin , and a Jew . From the latter part of the eleventh century Salernitan material is full of Semitic words , a few of which , such as the anatomical term nucha ' and the names of some drugs , linger in medical nomenclature to this day . ? 4 . Translation from the Arabic A very important agent of the Arabic revival was Constantine the African ( d. 1087 ) , a native of Carthage , who came to Italy about the middle of the eleventh century . He became a monk at Montecassino , and spent the rest of his life turning current Arabic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly Jewish writers of North African origin . In his desire for self-exaltation Constantine often conceals the names of the authors from whom he borrows , or he gives them inaccurately . His knowledge of both the languages which he was treating was far from thorough , and his translations are wretched . But these versions were very influential , and they remained current in the West long after they had been replaced by the better workmanship of Toledo students of the type of Gerard of Cremona ( 1114-1187 ) . It is interesting to note that one of Constantine 's works is dedicated to Alphanus , Archbishop of Salerno ( d. 1085 ) , who was perhaps the first medical translator direct from the Greek . The earliest Oriental influences that reached the West had thus been brought by foreign agents or carriers , but the desire for knowledge could not be satisfied thus . The movement that was soon to give rise to the univer-  | sities was shaping itself , and the Western student was beginning to become more curious and more desirous of going to the well-springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . Arabic was the language of Eastern science and letters , and its idiom was utterly different from the speech of the peoples of Europe . Moreover , its grammar had not yet been reduced to rule in any Latin work , nor could teachers be easily procured . Even in the thirteenth century we find that Roger Bacon , though he clearly perceived the importance of linguistic study and eagerly sought to unlock the literature of foreign tongues , had still not found the key . He had only time to commence laboriously the grammatical apparatus of the Greek and Hebrew languages . The only way to learn Arabic was to go to an Arabic-speaking country . Yet this was a dangerous and difficult adventure , involving hardship , secrecy , and perhaps abjuration of faith . Moreover , to learn the language at all adequately for rendering scientific treatises into Latin meant a stay of years , while the work of translation demanded also some understanding of the subject-matter to be translated . There is good evidence that an effective knowledge of this kind was very rarely attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . At the period during which Western science began to draw from Moslem sources there were only two areas of contact of the two cultures : these were respectively Spain and the Sicilies ' . The conditions in the two were somewhat similar . In the tenth century the Iberian peninsula was Moslem save for the small kingdoms of the French march , Leon , Navarre , and Aragon . Here the grip of Islam had soon relaxed , and this territory remained historically , religiously , racially , and linguistically a part of the Latin West . The Moslem South was ruled from Cordova , which  | became increasingly Mohammedanized , but at the more northern Toledo the subject population , though speaking an Arabic patois , remained in the main Christian , though with a very large Jewish element . In 1085 Alphonso VI of Leon ( Alphonso I of Castille ) , aided by the Cid , conquered Toledo , and there most of the work of transmission took place . The schools of Southern Italy and Sicily were on the whole less influential , though their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are , however , important in another respect , for from them went forth the first renderings of scientific works made direct from the Greek . These translations of scientific works direct from the Greek began to appear as early as the eleventh century , when Alph anus Archbishop of Salerno ( d. 1085 ) produced a Latin version of a work by Nemesius ( fourth century ) . Such translations increased in number and importance gradually and very slowly . A most interesting worker in Sicily was Burgundio of Pisa ( d. 1194 ) , who made translations both from the Arabic and the Greek . It is evident that the process of translation from Arabic , especially in Spain , was frequently carried on by the intervention of Jewish students , and many of the translated works were themselves by Jews . The tenth , eleventh , and twelfth centuries , a time of low degradation of the Latin intellect , was the best period of Jewish learning in Spain . Arabic was the natural linguistic medium of these learned Jews . Among them were the Egyptian physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West Isaac Judaeus , Solomon ibn Gabirol ( 1021 ? 1058 ? ) of Saragossa who was disguised in scholastic writings as Avicebron , and Moses ben Maimon ( 1135 ? 1204 ) of Cordova , more familiarly known as Maimonides . These three authors were among the more important and influential that were rendered into Latin from Arabic during the Middle Ages ,  | and their works form part of the Eastern heritage won by the translators during these centuries . All three deeply influenced Western scholasticism . In the twelfth , thirteenth , and fourteenth centuries , when the tide had turned and Islam was in retreat , it was occasionally possible for a scholar with a gift for languages , such as Gerard of Cremona ( 1114 ? 1187 ) , to find a skilled native Christian teacher . But in the tenth or eleventh century Christian learning and Christian society in Spain were subject and depressed . Like many modern peoples similarly placed , these native Christians were attached with the more fanaticism to the religion which held them together and to the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no effective Christian teacher of literary Arabic , while the very sciences which he sought to acquire were suspect as the mark of the infidel and the oppressor . It thus comes about that there is some obscurity ? much of it doubtless intentional ? as to the circumstances under which the best translations from the Arabic were made . It is apparent , however , that these earlier versions were sometimes prepared by a group of three or more who would interpret one to the other . One would turn the Arabic text , sentence by sentence , into the vernacular or into Hebrew , another would then render it into Latin and perhaps a third would turn it into literary form . Naturally , in this process many words would be encountered that could not be rendered either into the vernacular or into the barbarous Latin of the time . Especial difficulty would be encountered with technical terms . The meaning of some of these might well be imperfectly known to the translators themselves . Such words were therefore often simply carried over , transliterated , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are full of Semitic expressions . The Latin mediaeval astronomical  | and mathematical vocabularies especially abound in these Semitic words , many of which , such as azure ' , zero ' , zenith ' , cipher ' , azimuth ' , algebra ' , nadir ' , and names of stars , as Aldebaran ' and Altair ' , are still in use . Most of the Latin medical literature of the Middle Ages , too , was of Arabian origin and contained a whole host of Semitic words which , however , were almost all displaced by equivalents of Greek origin during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . The sort of translation which emerged from the process that we have described may well be imagined . When it is also remembered that to reach the Arabic from the original Greek the text had already passed through similar stages , usually with Syriac as an intermediary , it will be understood that the first scientific books that reached the West were often but travesties of the Greek originals from which they were ultimately derived . Men who may be supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured are Adelard of Bath ( c. iioo ) , who journeyed both to Spain and to Sicily , and published a compendium of Arabic science , and the wizard Michael Scot ( 1175 ? ? 1234 ? ) , who visited the court of Frederick II at Naples and produced versions or abridgements of the biological works of Aristotle . Such men , like Gerbert before them and Peter of Abano after them , were frequently accused of magical practices . More scientific in their methods and probably better equipped linguistically were Robert of Chester ( c. 1144 ) , who rendered the Koran into Latin and translated the valuable algebra of Al Khowarizmi ( fl. 83o ) as well as works on alchemy and astronomy , and Alfred the Englishman ( c. 118o ) , who translated from Arabic the corrupted peripatetic work On Plants , and thus preserved for us a fragment of a work of the Aristotelian school that would otherwise be lost . Robert and Alfred worked in Spain .  | But the greatest and most typical of all the translators from the Arabic was Gerard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Toledo and obtained a thorough knowledge of Arabic from a native Christian teacher . He is credited with having translated into Latin no less than ninety-two complete Arabic works . Many of them are of very great length , among them being the Almagest of Ptolemy on which Regiomontanus began his work in the fifteenth century , and the enormous Canon of Avicenna ( 980-1037 ) , perhaps the most widely read medical treatise ever penned , editions of which continued to be issued right down to the middle of the seventeenth century . The Canon of Avicenna is still in current use in the East . Contemporary with Gerard of Cremona , and perhaps stimulated by him , were certain native translators . One of these was Domenico Gonzalez ( Gundissalinus , fl. 1140 ) , a Christian who rendered into Latin the Physica and the De caelo et mundo of Aristotle . Another Spaniard , Johannes Hispalensis or Ibn Daud , known to the Latins as Avendeath ( fl. 1130-1155 ) , was a converted Jew . Avendeath translated , among many other works , the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the astronomical works of the Egyptian Jewish writer Messahalah ( Ma scha'a Allah = What God will ' , 770-820 ) . This Latin translation of Messahalah long formed the staple popular account of the system of the world under the name of the Englishman John Holywood ( Sacrobosco ' , d. 1256 ) . Gonzalez and Avendeath , like Gerard , worked at Toledo . The Sicilian group was less active . The Optics of Ptolemy was translated about 1150 by the Sicilian admiral Eugenius of Palermo . He rendered it from the Arabic though he had an effective knowledge of Greek . The great astronomical and mathematical system of Ptolemy known to the Middle Ages as the Almagest was  | also first translated into Latin from the Arabic in Sicily in 1163 ( some twelve years before it was rendered by Gerard at Toledo ) , and Arabian versions only of the work were available until the fifteenth century . The last translator of Sicilian origin , the Jew Farragut ( Farradj ben Selim , Moses Farachi , d. 1285 ) , was a student at Salerno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence that issued from that ancient seat of learning . Such later translators were , however , usually less influential , and at the end of the thirteenth century , we may say that the period of important translations was rapidly closing . ? 5 . Content of Mediaeval Science . The Astrological Clue We have now to turn to the actual material thus conveyed to Latin Christendom . It differed rather in degree than in kind from that of the earlier Dark Age and from that of the age of Arabian infiltration . The systems differed in the extent to which certain logical conclusions from the premises provided were pushed , and in the amount to which each was influenced by certain theological conceptions . In the late classical age there had developed the Stoic system of thought , which divided with Neoplatonism and Epicureanism all the more philosophical minds of the ancient world . This Stoic philosophy assumed that man 's fate was determined by an interplay of forces , the nature and character of which were , in theory at least , completely knowable . The microcosm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay around him . But how and to what extent did the one reflect the other ? In seeking to determine these points Stoicism , like Neoplatonism and the other philosophical systems of the classical twilight , gleaned from many sources material which it passed on  | in a corrupted state to the Latin West . In a somewhat less imperfect form such material lingered for centuries in the Byzantine East until , with the great outburst of Islam , it was caught up and elaborated by the Arabic culture . Thus elaborated , it was sent forth a second time to Latin Europe by the process of infiltration and translation . The astrological conceptions of the Stoics and of the later Christian ages drew both on Plato and on Aristotle . The hylozoism of the Timaeus , the doctrine that the universe itself and the matter of which it is composed is living , gave a suggestive outline to the hypothesis of the parallelism of the outer and inner universe . But the main details , on which the hypothesis was based , were drawn from Aristotle , whose views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed the framework on which the whole of mediaeval science from the thirteenth century onward was built . Especially Aristotle 's conception of the stars as living things , of a nature higher and nobler than that of any substance or being in the spheres below , was a point of departure from which the influence of the heavenly bodies over human destinies might be developed . Changes undergone by bodies on the earth below ? all phenomena in fact ? were held to be controlled by parallel movements in the heavens above . The theory carried the matter farther . Taking its clue from the Aristotelian conception of the perfection ' of the circle among geometrical figures , it distinguished the perfect , regular , circular motion of the fixed stars from the imperfect , irregular , linear motion of the planets . The fixed stars , moving regularly in a circle , controlled the ordered course of nature , the events that proceeded in recurring , manifest , and un tlterable rounds , such as winter and summer , night and day , growth and decay . The planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least errant in their movements , governed the more variable and less easily ascertainable events in the world around and within us , the happenings that make life the uncertain , hopeful , dangerous , happy thing it is . It was to the ascertainment of the factors governing this kaleidoscope of life that astrology set itself . The general outline was fixed , death in the end was sure , and , to the believing Christian , life after it . But there was a great uncertain zone between the sure and the unsure that might be predicted and perhaps avoided , or , if not avoided , its worst consequences abated . It was to this process of insurance that the astrologer set himself , and his task remained the same throughout the Middle Ages . In this hope , savoir afin de firevoir , the mediaeval astrologer was at one with the modern scientist . In the earlier Middle Ages , however , as in the earliest Christian centuries , the world was but God 's footstool , and all its phenomena were far less worthy of study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many patristic writers the study of the stars was likely to lead to indifference to Him that sitteth above the heavens . This is the general attitude of the fourth and fifth centuries , set forth for instance by Augustine , who speaks of those impostors the mathematicians i.e. astrologers . . . who use no sacrifice , nor pray to any spirit for their divinations , which arts Christian and true piety consistently rejects and condemns ' . By the sixth and seventh centuries , however , the Church had come to terms with astrology , and Isidore regards it as , in part at least , a legitimate science . He distinguishes , however , between natural and superstitious astrology . The latter is the science practised by the mathematici who read prophecies in the heavens , and place the twelve constellations of the Zodiac as rulers over the members of man 's body and soul , and predict  | the nativities and dispositions of men by the courses of the stars ' . Nevertheless Isidore accepts many of the conclusions of astrology . He advises physicians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence over plant and animal life and control over the humours of man , while he accepts without question the influence of the dog-star and of comets . He is followed by the other Dark Age writers on natural knowledge , who accept successively more and more astrological doctrine . With the advent of the Arabian learning the matter was carried farther , and astrology became the central interest . It retained this position until the triumph of the experimental method in the seventeenth century . We can not here follow the details of the developed astrological scheme . It is enough for our purpose to have observed that the general material law which it implies had become widely accepted in the Middle Ages , and to have traced its passage from antiquity and from the Orient into the thought of the West and of the period of which we are treating . Especial attention was always paid to the zodiacal signs and to the planets . Each zodiacal sign was held to govern or to have special influence on some region of the body , and each of the planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations of zodiacal signs , planets , and bodily parts and organs , together with their power to produce disease , had been set forth in such late Latin writers as Firmicus Maternus ( c. 330 ) and Avienus ( c. 380 ) and in innumerable Greek texts . This belief , conveyed to the Dark Age , but much corrupted and attenuated during its course , was brought back again to the West , reinforced and developed , in translations from the Arabic during the scholastic period which followed .  | ? 6 . Scholasticism and Science Doctrine of this type received into Europe was stamped with the special form of Western thought . Now , it was characteristic of the mediaeval Western thinker that he sought always a complete scheme of things . He was not content to separate , as we do , one department of knowledge or one class of phenomena , and consider it in and by itself . Still less would he have held it a virtue to become a specialist , to limit his outlook to one department with the object of increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be remembered , so far as it was material , was limited . The outer limit was the primum mobile , the outermost of the concentric spheres of which the Aristotelian world was composed . Of the structure and nature of all within the sphere of the primum mobile he had been provided with a definite scheme . The selfappointed task of mediaeval science was to elaborate that scheme in connexion with the moral world . This was first especially undertaken by mystical writers working under the stimulus of the new Arabian influence . Such authors as Hugh of St. Victor ( 1095-1141 ) , who drew on the earlier and more vague Arabian rumours , Bernard Sylvestris ( c. 1150 ) , who relied on Hermann the Cripple ( 1013-1054 ) , and Hildegard ( 1098-1180 ) , who was influenced by Bernard Sylvestris and by other Arabicized writings , all produced most elaborate mystical schemes based on the doctrine of the macrocosm and microcosm . These schemes took into account the form of the world and of man as derived from Arabian sources , and read into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind there could be no ultimate distinction between physical events , moral truths , and spiritual experiences . In their fusion of the internal and external universe these mystics have much in common with the  | mystics of all ages . The culmination of the process , so far as our period is concerned , is reached with Dante ( 1265-1321 ) . But with the thirteenth century new currents of thought set in . Arabian science had at last been won , the scientific works of Aristotle were becoming accessible and gradually entering the curriculum , the universities were firmly established , and there were the beginnings of a knowledge of Greek . A contemporary religious movement of vast importance was the foundation of the mendicant religious orders the activities of which largely replaced those of the monastic Benedictines . Among these new orders were two that specially influenced the Universities , the Dominicans or Black Friars founded at Toulouse in 1215 by the austere and orthodox Dominic ( 1170 ? 1221 ) and the Franciscans or Grey Friars founded in 1209 by the gentle and loving Francis of Assisi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hermits or Austin ( Augustinian ) Friars were less weighty . The name of Dominic is associated with the terrible extermination of the Albigenses , and the Dominicans ( the Domini canes , hounds of the Lord ) set themselves to the strengthening of the doctrine of the Church and to the extirpation of error . The work of the Franciscans led up more clearly to the scientific revival . During the thirteenth century these two orders provided most of the great university teachers , who occupied themselves in marshalling the new knowledge and making it more accessible . Alexander of Hales ( d. 1245 ) and Robert Grosseteste ( d. 1253 ) were Franciscans , Albertus Magnus ( 1206 ? 1280 ) and St. Thomas Aquinas ( 1227 ? 1274 ) were Dominicans . A foremost influence in the revival was the recovery of the writings of Aristotle . It was the interpretation of these works by a few great thinkers that gave to  | Scholasticism its essential character . Thus it is that the history of the recovery of the Aristotelian corpus has been a main theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first scholastic to be acquainted with the whole works of Aristotle was Alexander of Hales . Albert was the first who reduced the whole philosophy of Aristotle to systematic order with constant reference to the Arabian commentators , while Aquinas remodelled the Aristotelian philosophy in accordance with the requirements of ecclesiastical doctrine . As time went on , the works of Aristotle , at first represented in translations from Arabic , gradually became accessible in renderings direct from the Greek . A very important agent in this process was the Dominican William of Moerbeke ( d. 1286 ) . It is remarkable that this process of codifying the new knowledge , involving as it did a rapid development in the whole mental life , did not early develop a more passionate and more conscious faith in the reality and value of progress in knowledge . The test of such faith , so far as nature is concerned , must be the direct appeal to nature . Yet there is very little evidence of direct observation of nature in the great physical encyclopaedias of the thirteenth century , such as those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican Vincent de Beauvais ( 1190-1264 ) , or the Franciscan Bartholomew of England ( c. 1260 ) . The fact is that the mediaeval mind was obsessed with the idea of the world as mortal , destructible , finite , and therefore completely knowable both in space and in time . Thus the motive for detailed research , in our modern sense of the word , was hardly present . One . great Islamic philosopher there was , Averroes ( Ibn Roschd , d. 1198 ) , who took an opposite view . His works were available in Latin , but the great ecclesiastics set their face against him , and his theories were adopted by few but Jews .  | The mediaeval world thus knew nothing of that infinite sea of experience on which the man of science nowadays launches his bark in adventurous exploration . The task of the writers of these encyclopaedias was rather to give a general outline of knowledge , to set forth such a survey of the universe as would be in accord with spiritual truth . The framework on which this encyclopaedic scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic commentator Averroes , the philosopher whom the heads of the Church had condemned . Yet it is an amusing reflection on the incompleteness of all philosophical systems that Albert ( 1206 ? 1280 ) , who perhaps more than any man was responsible for the scholastic world-system , was among the very few mediaeval writers who were real observers of nature . It is , after all , in the very essence of the human animal to love the world around it and to watch its creatures . Naturam expellas furca tamen usque recurret . Albert , scholastic of the scholastics , drowned in erudition and the most learned man of his time , has left us evidence in his great works on natural history that the scientific spirit was beginning to awake . As an independent observer he is not altogether contemptible , and this element in him marks the new dawn which we trace more clearly in his successors . ? 7 . The Dawn of Modern Science . Roger Bacon Thus the best of the systematizers among the schoolmen were leading on to the direct observation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aquinas ( 1227-1274 ) were several remarkable scholastic writers who form the earliest group with whom the conscious advancement of knowledge was a permanent interest . These men were the first consciously forward-looking scientific thinkers since the fourth century . Perhaps the most arresting of them was Robert Grosseteste ( c. 1175 ?  | 1253 ) , Bishop of Lincoln . Grosseteste determined the main direction of physical investigation in the thirteenth century by his work on Optics . He knows something of the action of mirrors and of the nature of lenses . It would appear that he had actually experimented with lenses , and many of the optical ideas of Roger Bacon were taken straight from his master . The main Arabian source of Grosseteste was a Latin translation of the mathematical work of Alhazen of Bazra ( 965-1038 ) . Another important optical writer whom Alhazen deeply influenced was the Pole Witelo ( fl. 1270 ) , an acute mathematical investigator who worked in northern Italy . Roger Bacon was largely dependent on Witelo . The opposition between the followers of Dominic and of Francis was paralleled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no stranger and more impressive chapter in the whole history of thought than that of the early history of the Franciscans . Within the memory of men who had known the saintly founder of the order ( 1181-1226 ) , the penitents of Assisi ' , the friars minor ' , sworn as jongleurs of God ' to bring Christ cheerfully to the humblest and the meanest , ? sworn to possess nothing , to earn their bread from day to day by the work of their own hands , or at need by begging , forbidden to lay by store or to accumulate capital , this order of humble servants of Christ had produced a series of monumental and scholarly intellects . These men not only initiated what bid fair to be a renaissance of science and letters , but also aided in the formation of the bulwark which long resisted the very movement that thus emanated from the order itself .

To the former , or scientific party , as we may call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , John Pecham , Archbishop of Canterbury ( d. 1292 ) ,  | the elusive Adam Marsh ( d. 1257 ) , and above all Roger Bacon ( 1214 ? 1294 ) . To the latter or theological party are attached the names of Alexander of Hales ( d. 1245 ) , Duns Scotus ( 1265 ? ? 13o8 ? ) , and William of Ockham ( d. 1349 ) . The primary inspirer of the scientific movement was the great Bishop of Lincoln himself , as we learn from his pupil Roger . Nobody ' , says Bacon , ' can attain to proficiency in the science of mathematics by the method hitherto known unless he devotes to its study thirty or forty years , . . . and that is the reason why so few study that science . . . . Yet there were found some famous men , as Robert Grosseteste Bishop of Lincoln , and Adam Marsh , and some others , who knew how by the power of mathematics to unfold the causes of all things and to give a sufficient explanation of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in the writings of those great men , as , for instance , in their works on the impression of the elements , on the rainbow and the comets , on the sphere , and on other questions appertaining both to theology and to natural philosophy . ' The work of this remarkable group of Franciscans at Oxford extended beyond the sciences to language and literature . There was thus the beginning of a real renaissance of Greek letters which died an early death . After Roger Bacon 's death the scientific revival also languished until recalled to life by a second revival of a later century . It may be convenient to give a summary of the scientific achievements of Roger Bacon , the greatest of the Franciscan group and the first man of science in the modern sense . 1 . He attempted to set forth a system of natural knowledge . This system was far in advance of his time , and its basis was observation and experiment . He was clearly the first man in modern Europe of whom this can be said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for the accurate study of foreign and ancient languages . He attempted grammars of Greek and Hebrew along definite scientific lines . He also projected a grammar of Arabic . Moreover , he laid down those lines of textual criticism which have only been developed within the last century . 3 . He not only discussed the nature of the experimental method , but was himself an experimenter . His writings are important for the development of the following sciences : ( a ) Optics . His work on this subject was a text-book for the next two centuries . He saw the importance of lenses and concave mirrors , and showed a grasp of the mathematical principles of optics . He described a system equivalent to a two-lens apparatus , and there is trustworthy evidence that he actually used a compound system of lenses equivalent to a telescope . ( b ) Astronomy was Bacon 's perpetual interest . He spent the best part of twenty years in the construction of astronomical tables . His letter to the Pope in favour of the correction of the calendar , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally , at third-hand , produced the Gregorian correction . ( c ) Geography . He was the first systematic geographer of the Middle Ages . He gave a systematic description of Europe , Asia , and part of Africa . He collected first-hand evidence from travellers in all these continents . His arguments as to the size and sphericity of the earth were among those that influenced Columbus . ( d ) Mechanical Science . Suggestions by him include the automatic propulsion of vehicles and vessels . He records a plan for a flying machine . ( e ) Chemistry . The chemical knowledge of his time was systematized in his tracts . His description of the composition and manufacture of gunpowder is the earliest  | that has reached us . It is clear that he had worked out for himself some of the chemistry of the subject . ( f ) Mathematics . His insistence on the supreme value of mathematics as a foundation for education recalls the attitude of Plato . It was an insistence that the method of thought was at least as important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be regarded as accuracy of method , criticism of authority , and reliance on experiment ? the pillars of modern science . ' Bacon was not an isolated phenomenon , but an important link in the chain of scientific development . But during the century after Bacon , thoughhis mathematical and philosophical works were still studied in the schools , the greatest advances were to be found among the physicians . Of medical men the last half of the thirteenth and the first half of the fourteenth century exhibit an especially brilliant group . Bologna had possessed a medical school since the twelfth century , and had inherited the learning of Salerno . At Bologna had worked Hugh of Lucca ( d. 1252 ? ) and his son or pupil Theodoric ( 1206 ? 1298 ) . Here surgery may be said to have been born again with the practice of Roland of Parma ( c. 1250 ) , the successor and faithful follower of Roger of Salerno ( c. 1220 ) . At Bologna , above all , William of Saliceto ( 1201 ? 1280 ) established a practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1276 ? 1328 ) , whose work based on translations from the Arabic text of Avicenna became the general anatomical text-book of the later Middle Ages . By the fourteenth century the practice of dissection of the human body had become well recognized . Footnote  | At the end of the thirteenth century the ancient foundation of the medical school of Montpellier was coming to the fore . The Catalan Arnald of Villanova ( 1235-1311 ) , one of the most remarkable personalities of mediaeval medicine , taught there . Arnald was not only one of the earliest exponents of the Hippocratic method of observing and carefully recording symptoms of actual cases of disease , but he also deeply influenced alchemy . That study was effectively of Arabian origin so far as the modern world is concerned . It begins in 1144 with the translation into Latin from Arabic by Robert of Chester of the De compositione alchemiac which Morienus Roinanus , a contemporary hermit of Jerusalem , had edited for Calid , king of the Egyptians ' . Alchemy had taken its rise with a real effort to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmuting the baser into the more precious . Like other mediaeval studies , it became linked with astrology , and the seven metals ' were each of them controlled or influenced by the seven planets ' much in the same way as were the organs of the human body . Of such ideas Arnald was a prolific exponent . He had a knowledge of both Arabic and Hebrew . A student at Naples and Salerno , a traveller in Italy , Sicily , France , and Spain , he served as medical adviser to the Papal Curia both at Rome and Avignon , and was employed as ambassador on more than one special mission . Arnald influenced politics no less than learning , and ended his adventurous life at sea . A character somewhat similar to Arnald was the Majorcan Raymond Lull ( 1235-1313 ) , who was learned in oriental languages and deeply influenced Alchemy .  | ? 8 . Humanism In outlook no less remarkable than Arnald was the heretical Peter of Abano ( 1250-c. 1318 ) . He earned a reputation as a magician , and his natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His body is said to have been exhumed and burned . Peter ? who was a most voluminous writer ? had a knowledge of Greek , acquired at Constantinople , and he translated works from that language . He was a professor at the University of Paris and later at Padua in the generation which followed that in which the newly won Aristotelian works on physics had entered the curriculum . His greatest and best-known work , the Conciliator , expresses his mediation between the now commencing humanistic Greek school and the Arabists . From that work we learn that he had come into contact with the great traveller Marco Polo ( c. 1254-1324 ) . Among the views of Peter of Abano that are most worth record may be mentioned his statements that the air has weight , that the brain is the source of the nerves and the heart of the vessels ? all ideas that were novel in his time . He made a remarkably accurate measure of the length of the year as 365 days , 6 hours , 4 minutes . The second half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the effects of the Black Death ( 1347-1349 ) , shows a distinct falling off in the intellectual advance . In medicine the most noteworthy name is that of Guy de Chauliac of Montpellier ( 1300-1370 ) , the most influential of all the mediaeval surgeons . Outside the ranks of the physicians the most striking figure in fourteenth-century science is probably the French Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gerson ( 1288-1344 ) . His work on astronomy was important as illustrating the consciousness of a growing discontent with the Ptolemaic system of the universe .  | With the fourteenth century appeared too a great movement , the hand of which is still heavy on our own day . Humanism was born . Historians have perhaps linked the humanistic movement too intimately with a knowledge of the Greek language . Instances of knowledge of that language in the West can , however , be adduced far back into the Dark Ages ( e. g . John Scot Erigena , c. 85o ) , while many of the greatest of the humanists , including Petrarch himself ( 1304-1374 ) , were without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linking humanism with the Middle Ages , that Petrarch 's epistolary style was still moulded on St. Augustine rather than on Cicero . The backward-looking habit , strong in man from his nature and strengthened by the teaching of the Christian religion , was yet further enforced by the humanists . From Petrarch onward they were ever brooding on the past that had been Greece and Rome . Yet even from the first , the humanists had the sensation too of being builders , so that their glance was at times turned away from the past and towards what was to come , nay , what was in the act of becoming . Roger Bacon and a few isolated souls had had this double vision , but for a whole school to possess it was something new . In his Book of memorable things Petrarch says outright , Here stand I as though on a frontier that divides two peoples , looking both to the past and to the future ' . While studying the classics some of these very men were indeed visibly forging new intellectual weapons , those national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is no mere coincidence that Boccaccio ( 1313-1375 ) , friend and contemporary of Petrarch , should have been at once the first modern literary man to study Greek and the first great master of Italian prose . We must note , however , that save for reverence for the one supreme poet in their own tongue , Dante ( 1265-1321 ) ,  | the backward gaze of the Italian humanist is always fixed on the more distant classical past , not on the nearer period that came to be regarded as a yawning chasm , an abyss across which he sought to reach back to the thought of antiquity . To him the Middle Ages seemed real enough and dark enough . It stood for the period during which the sweet Greek literature had been ignored . Even in this new age it could be understood by few except in Latin dress , and the work of translation remained somewhat of a specialist 's occupation . To the end of the fifteenth century an effective knowledge of Greek continued to be a rarity even among scholars , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixteenth century who were still without it . The great influence of the masterpieces of Greece , therefore , was then as now something indirect , often conveyed through translators and special interpreters , a subtle thing that influenced men 's way of thinking rather than the actual content of their minds . The mere capacity for translation from the Greek goes back , as we have seen , to the eleventh century , the ninth century , or even beyond . It can therefore hardly have been simply the discovery of the actual Greek language which brought about the revival of letters . But if the knowledge of Greek goes back so far , can we speak of a real Renaissance at all ? How can we account for the change of heart that came over the world when humanism was born ? Or is that change of heart but an illusion , a difference of degree rather than of kind in a world where everything is in a state of becoming ? Some answer to this absorbing question we may glean by comparing the earlier Greek works which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The general character of the earlier translations was determined by the outlook of a world becoming ever more deeply Arabicized . Islam ,  | the inheritor of antiquity , entered into the enjoyment of its legacy with great spirit , but with a taste already fixed . The literary and artistic works were debarred by a definite theological standpoint . Homer and Hesiod , Sophocles and Euripides , Greek Art and Greek Architecture were chapters as closed and forbidden to Islam as to early Christian Europe . It was the philosophical , the scientific , the mathematical , the medical works that made an appeal . These gave an illusory impression of completeness to life with which Islam long rested content . It was these very works that were the first to be rendered into Latin from the Arabic , and the Latin taste being thus determined it was similar works that were the first to be turned into Latin direct from the Greek . Such material ? and it is bulky and intricate enough ? represents the Western access to Greek wisdom before the fourteenth century . It does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who think the discovery of the humanists was the Greek language ? here the humanists were but followers where others had been pioneers . It is something much deeper and more fundamental which they have handed on to us , something the nature of which they hardly knew and the meaning of which they missed in their enthusiasm . The humanists discovered the literary works of antiquity . In them they became absorbed to the exclusion of all else . The humanist eagerness passed into a literary vogue , and long cast the blight of a purely literary education on the modern world . The barren striving after form as distinct from substance , the miserable and slavish imitativeness that is no flattery but an insult to its model , these features , exhibited typically in the literature of the late Empire , were repeated by the humanists as they have been often repeated in modern times . The humanist then did not give us the knowledge of a language nor did he even give an insight into the life  | of antiquity . What the humanist really gave was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made possible a completer reconstruction of the Greek spirit . That reconstruction , indeed , he was never able to make ; it was the succeeding generations that made it for themselves . With that reconstruction Greece lived again , the modern world was ushered in , and modern science , art , literature , and philosophy were born . It is an illuminating reflection and one not without bearing on our present state that both the mediaeval heritage of Greek science and the Renaissance heritage of Greek literature proved barren by themselves . It was not until the one fertilized the other that there was real and vital growth . Modern thought , modern science , modern art , and modern letters are the offspring of that union . ? 9 . The Science of the Renaissance The humanists as a class did not exhibit great sympathy with the scientific outlook . Their interests were literary and their peculiar aversion was the Arabist tendency of the Middle Ages that they were leaving behind . That Arabist tendency was very largely expressed in the ancient scientific and philosophical themes , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement initiated by Roger Bacon in the thirteenth century a new element had been introduced . That movement had fallen into the background after Roger 's death . It had not entirely died , but it had become ' quietist ' ? if the expression may be used in this connexion ? a part of the seldom-expressed faith of a small band of philosophically-minded recluses . Faith in the appeal to nature was at last to find more open expression . With the fifteenth century , discontent with the entire mediaeval scientific scheme becomes more generally obvious , and we perceive a first hint of the idea  | that it may be possible to adjust theory by means of experiment . The earliest suggestion is made by a man of high genius and scholarship , the Rhinelander Nicholas of Cues ( 1401 ? 1464 ) , who became a cardinal and made a fruitless attempt to reform the calendar . The philosophical basis of the experimental suggestion of Nicholas of Cues is set forth in his book De docta ignorantia , which has nothing to do with the absurdity of erudition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but concerns itself with acknowledged ignorance , i. e. with the inability of the human mind to conceive the infinite . His theoretical views led him to a belief that the earth is moving , though he attained to no genuine heliocentric theory . He records a careful experiment on a growing plant ? afterward pirated by the seventeenth-century writer van Helmont ( 1577 ? 1644 ) ? proving that it absorbs something of weight from the air . This is the first biological experiment of modern times , and incidentally the first formal proof that the air has weight . In another work , De staticis experimentis , Nicholas shows that he knew how to apply the experimental method in detail , and he suggests in outline many investigations which were not taken in hand until the time of Galileo 150 years later . The tradition of the combination of scholarship and observation that Nicholas had started was carried on by several astronomers in the second half of the fifteenth century . For part of this work we are indebted to the far-sightedness of another Cardinal , Johannes Bessarion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally anxious to aid the progress of astronomical knowledge and to diffuse Greek literature in the West . Bessarion 's friendship , extended to the two German astronomers Purbach and Regiomontanus , made possible their work which formed the foundation of that of Copernicus.  | George Purbach ( 1423 ? 1461 ) followed with great avidity the study of Ptolemy . He died prematurely and had only translations from the Arabic on which to base his work . He improved on his original , however , by calculating a table for every 10 minutes , using sines instead of chords . Johannes Muller ( 1436 ? 1476 ) of Konigsberg ( =King 's mountain ) , usually known from his birthplace as Regiomontanus , though his life was hardly longer than that of Purbach , had the good fortune to work on Greek originals . He produced the first systematic treatise on trigonometry and a table of sines for every minute and of tangents for every degree . He edited too the Epitome of Ptolemy which Purbach had left behind him in an imperfect state . He died at Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long-contemplated reform of the Calendar . The important works of Regiomontanus were only published after his death . His name has become associated with an ill-founded legend that he taught the heliocentric view of the solar system before Copernicus . The statement has been made of several other contemporaries , Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452 ? 1519 ) among them . It has been verified , however , for only one of them ( Celio Calcagnini , 1479 ? 1541 ) , who perhaps borrowed the idea from Copernicus . The most remarkable philosophical teacher of the Renaissance was perhaps Pietro Pomponazzi ( 1462 ? 1525 ) , a writer who , in many respects , foreshadows the new period and the work of its great philosopher Francis Bacon . Pomponazzi was a physician who became a professor of philosophy and devoted himself to the exposition of what he believed to be the teaching of Aristotle . Though incapable of interpreting Aristotle to his hearers from the original Greek , Pomponazzi was yet a very spirited and original teacher , of great independence of thought . He was wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died repudiating the hope of Christianity . But Pomponazzi represents a movement of far more importance than any mere school of Aristotelian interpretation . He stands for Naturalism , for the attempt to explain the World and all that it contains on the basis of known or discoverable laws . That many of the laws considered by him as demonstrated now seem absurdities , that on insufficient evidence he regarded certain earthly events as related to the movements of the heavenly bodies with the same assurance that we now ascribe them to climate or meteorological conditions , these are errors in the application of his method that need not affect our judgement of the importance of his philosophical position . The Renaissance of Letters was contemporary with the Renaissance of Art , and the artists had also their reaction upon scientific thought . The great painters had begun to study nature more closely . Antonio Pollaiuolo ( 1429 ? 1498 ) and Andrea del Verrocchio ( 1435 ? 1488 ) , among others , had made careful investigations of surface anatomy , while the exquisite figures of plants in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out as a very accurate observer . There was , however , one artist of the time who takes a quite peculiar place among students of nature . Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452 ? 1519 ) stands for many as the turning-point of the Renaissance into modern times . It would be impossible to give in a paragraph the titles to fame of one of the very greatest geniuses that the human race has produced . The marvellous rapidity of his insight , the sureness of his intuitions , and his extreme versatility made earlier students place Leonardo in an isolated and almost non-human position . His very limitations , moreover , while they have increased the apparent gulf which separates him from other men , have  | hampered the comprehension of his mind . Isolated he remains by the loftiness of his genius , but more prolonged study has revealed many of the sources of his knowledge and some of his methods of work . To understand anything of Leonardo 's scientific work and of its fate we must however recognize his defects . Leonardo 's great limitation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift for language and did not acquire even an elementary knowledge of Latin till well on in life . He had no power of literary expression . The language that he employs is that of a Florentine shopkeeper of the lower class . He created no great phrase or saying . In his note-books his sentences are usually ungrammatical and often unfinished . Even allowing for the purely private nature of these memoranda , it is yet fairly evident that in a literary sense he was incoherent . The very rush of his ideas seems to have obstructed the natural channels of their expression . Of him his biographer Vasari quotes with admirable point the lines of Petrarch : E 1 ' amor di saper the m ' ha si acceso Che 1 ' opera e retardato dal desio . My love of knowledge so inflamed me That my work was retarded by my very desire . With what we now know of Leonardo the question may reasonably be raised whether his art did , in fact , consume the major part of his energy and his thoughts . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output and for the extreme slowness with which he worked . On the other hand , he left behind him a vast mass of papers , about 5,000 leaves of which have survived . These contain evidence not only of a unique scientific insight but of a tireless industry which is almost incredible . He covers the whole field of science from mathematics to physiology , and there is nothing that he touches which  | he does not illuminate . To give but a few scattered instances : he presents us not only with a model of a flying machine but with an invention of a helicopter , and he analyses the nature of flight of birds in a way that has only been surpassed during the last few years ; he has a design for a parabolic compass on a principle that was not adopted till late in the seventeenth century ; he hints at a heliocentric view of the world ; he has admirable drawings of quick-firing and breech-loading guns ; he has mastered the theoretical principles of perspective ; he sets forth the homologies of the vertebrate skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and his anatomical and embryological standpoint was not passed in certain respects for hundreds of years . Leonardo may be linked with his time by tracing some of his scientific ideas back to his predecessors . The break in continuity is much more marked if we seek to trace them forwards . He had indeed very little influence on the science of the age which immediately followed him . Save in certain ideas and drawings of a few sixteenthcentury anatomists leading on to Vesalius , the scientific work of Leonardo was without effect until modern times . If Leonardo be regarded as the topmost peak of the Renaissance , that peak , continuous with a long range of mighty mountains on one side , terminates in an almost sheer precipice on the other . Before we quite part with the Renaissance we must consider another remarkable character whose life-course was almost as isolated and aberrant as that of Leonardo . The Swiss writer Aurelius Philippus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim , commonly known as Paracelsus ( 1493-1541 ) , was a person of violent , dramatic and repellent temper , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the worship of the old idols . His symbolic act of burning the works both of the  | Greek Galen and of the Arab Avicenna , as an introduction to his lecture course at Basel , typified the position of the independent investigators of the generation that immediately followed him . A writer of excessive obscurity , an obscurity of language , of form , and of thought , very few have claimed the privilege of penetrating to his full meaning , and those few have nearly all been infected with some of the defect of expression from which the master suffered . There is , however , a general agreement among the learned and nebulous band of Paracelsists that their hero did indeed foreshadow the new instauration ' . His aim was to see the world in the Light of Nature ' . That light of his is dimmed for us because of his extreme gullibility in some matters , his violence and self-contradiction in others , and the involved and mystical presentment in all . Nature ' contained for him the influence of the stars upon the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He believed still in a relation of microcosm and macrocosm ? as in a residual sense we all do ? but his free modification of that theory paved the way for its rejection in the generation which followed . ? io . The Great Instauration Francis Bacon ( 1561-162o ) , coming at the very end of our period , grasped the nature of the truth that had been struggling to birth since the days of his great namesake . He called it the Instauratio Magna , the great restoration . Of him a modern enthusiast for research ( Mark Pattison ) has written , the great instaurator of all knowledge , in preaching the necessity of altering the whole method of knowing included the method of " teaching to know " ' . Of the reformers of the method of teaching to know , two stand . at the very threshold of the new era , Nicholas Copernicus and Andreas Vesalius.  | The Pole Nicholas Copernicus ( 1473-1543 ) , despite the vast change that was introduced in his name into men 's ideas , was himself more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cues and Regiomontanus than the more revolutionary Leonardo or Paracelsus . No man was ever more ' academic ' , and he continued to attend university courses until over thirty years of age . He studied at several Italian universities , giving attention to classics , mathematics , astronomy , medicine , law , and theology . His skill in painting suggests that he had that type of visualizing imagination frequently associated with scientific power . Copernicus was not , however , a first-hand observer on any large scale . He had , it is true , taken a number of observations of eclipses and oppositions of planets , but for the most part his results were obtained in the study . He tells us that he was induced to seek a new theory of the heavenly bodies by finding that mathematicians differed among themselves on this subject . He had counted up the various motions of the heavenly bodies involved in the old system and concluded that some essential factor had been missed . He therefore turned to antiquity and learned from Cicero ? who quotes Hiket as ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . ' Occasioned by this , ' he says , ' I decided to try whether , on the assumption of some motion of the earth , better explanations of the revolutions of the heavenly spheres might not be found . Thus assuming the motions which I attribute to the earth . . . I have found that when the motions of the other planets are referred to the circulation of the earth and are computed for the revolution of each star , not only do the phenomena necessarily follow therefrom , but the order and magnitude of the stars and of all their orbs and the heaven itself are so connected that in no part can anything be transposed without confusion to the rest and to the whole universe . '  | In this new scheme the ancient theory of the uniform circular motion of the heavenly bodies was still retained . Since it involved the retention of the theory of epicycles as well as the displacement of the sun from the true centre of the planetary orbs , the simplicity of the scheme was only apparent and comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every respect a contrast to Copernicus . Young , ardent and combative , his life 's work was wellnigh complete at twenty-eight , and its effective and creative part was crowded into the four years that preceded the publication of the Fabrica in 1543 . The contents of that great work were delivered in the form of lecture-demonstrations to crowded audiences . It contains an enormous number of first-hand observations which must have been accumulated while working under the most extreme pressure . Vigorous and fearless in the demonstration of observed fact , Vesalius becomes more timid and less effective in the discussion of theory , and he leaves the Galenic physiology practically intact . He was a man of the laboratory and lecture-room rather than of the study , and reflection was not the source of his power . Yet even his observations are by no means completely free from traditional bias . Thus some of the poses of the figures and the treatment of the skeletons in his book have been shown to be derived from scholastic sources , and there are anatomical structures figured by him which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the human body . There are important points which he may have derived by tradition from Leonardo and the artist-anatomists of the previous generation . Taken as a whole , his work is , however , one of the most marvellous efforts of scientific observation that has ever been launched upon the world . A word must be said as to the point of view of Vesalius . Nowadays the student 's dissection-manual figures for  | him the anatomy of the dead . Vesalius working in Italy in the sixteenth century was in the midst of a country of artists . He thinks always of the living body and seeks to restore the anatomy of the part into its form when living . The dramatic poses of his corpses and the landscape with which each is provided is no piece of idle artistry . It is a part of his scheme . Nor does he think so much of the actual body he is dissecting as of the idea towards which God is tending in us all . Each body is , as it were , one of that supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art . It is the anatomist 's duty to attain as near as he can to that ideal . The work of Vesalius was carried farther by a number of investigators in the latter part of the sixteenth century , but by none with greater skill and intensity than Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente ( 1537 ? 1619 ) , a successor of Vesalius in the chair at Padua , where he taught for over sixty years and where William Harvey ( 1578 ? 1657 ) was his pupil . Fabricius was one of the most successful and stimulating of medical teachers and he added an enormous number of facts to the sum of anatomical and physiological knowledge . As an investigator , however , he lacked , like all his contemporaries , complete speculative freedom . For that the time was still hardly ripe , and his physiology was still largely Galenic . While he provided many of the observations on which the view of the circulation of the blood was built , his vision remained obscured by the traditional outlook . It was left to his great English pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next century . The grasp of Galen was weakening , but it had not yet wholly relaxed . The mentality of Tycho Brahe ( 1546 ? 1601 ) , the greatest astronomer of the second half of the sixteenth century , was not dissimilar to that of Fabricius , its greatest anatomist . Tycho , like Fabricius , was a first-class observer , but ,  | like him , weak and timid in drawing conclusions . By means of newly designed but simple apparatus employed with exquisite skill , Tycho attained an unprecedented degree of accuracy in astronomical observation . His records were employed later by his colleague Johann Kepler ( 1571-1630 ) . These observations aided Kepler to purge the Copernican hypothesis of the traditional notions concerning the movements of the heavenly bodies in circles . The circles were replaced by ellipses and modern astronomy was born . The year 1600 is associated with two- important events in the history of science , which mark it out as the final parting of the ways . In that year Giordano Bruno ( 1548 ? 1600 ) , a profound student of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Copernicus , suffered martyrdom at the stake . In that year William Gilbert ( 1540 ? 1603 ) produced his work On the magnet , on magnetic bodies and on the earth as a great magnet , a new physiography 1 demonstrated by many arguments and experiments . The work is the first great scientific treatise published in England , but it is much more . It is a landmark in the history of science as a whole . Gilbert accepts fully the Copernican view of a heliocentric world and he speculates fearlessly on observed conclusions . Above all , as the title of the work tells , his views are demonstrated by arguments and experiments . It is a distinction of which he never loses sight , and he is careful to record exactly and by a special device his own personal experiences . These are clearly separated from his arguments and from the experiences of others . The book has the form and spirit of a modern scientific treatise . We have now left utterly behind the Middle Ages and all their works and ways . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is best translated by our word physiography.  | macrocosm and microcosm was no longer possible to those who had studied and understood the works of Copernicus and Vesalius . Men no longer studied macrocosm and microcosm as such , but they became physicists or physiologists , taking each of them a separated portion of the universe for special study . This disposition to base opinion on observation , involving separation of nature into departments , characterizes the modern method and distinguishes it from the mediaeval . The dawn was past and it was the risen sun that Harvey and Galileo saluted , and in the light of which Francis Bacon and Descartes prophesied . Footnote  | THE FIRST PHYSICAL SYNTHESIS A. N. WHITEHEAD THERE are in the history of civilization certain dates which stand out as marking either the boundaries or the culminations of critical epochs .

Such a date is the year 1642 of our epoch , the year in which occurred the death of Galileo and the birth of Newton . This date marks the centre of that period of about zoo years , during which the scientific intellect of Europe was framing that First Physical Synthesis which has remained down to our own times as the basis of science . The development of modern Europe from the world of the Renaissance and the Reformation is unintelligible in its unique importance without an understanding of the achievements of these two men . The great civilizations of Asia and of the classical times in the Mediterranean had their epochs of artistic and literary triumph , of religious reformation , and of active scientific speculation . But it was the fortune of modern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific speculation , two men , one after the other , appeared , each with a supreme gift of physical intuition , with magnificent powers of abstract generalization , and each with subsidiary endowments exactly suited to the immediate circumstances of the scientific problem , this one a supreme experimentalist and enough of a mathematician , and that one a supreme mathematician and enough of an experimentalist . Archimedes left no successor . But our modern civilization is due to the fact that in the year when Galileo died , Newton was born . Think for a moment of the possible course of history supposing that the life 's work of these two men were absent . At the commencement of the eighteenth century many curious and baffling facts of physical science would have been observed , vaguely connected by detached and obscure hypotheses . But in the absence of a clear physical synthesis , with its overwhelming success in the solution of problems which from the most remote antiquity had excited attention , the motive for the next advance would have been absent . All epochs pass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Locke 's philosophy would never have been written ; and Voltaire when he visited England would have carried back to France merely a story of expanding commerce and of the political rivalries between aristocratic factions . Europe might then have lacked the French intellectual movement . But the Fates do not always offer the same gifts twice , and it is possible that the eighteenth century might then have prepared for the western races an intellectual sleep of a thousand years , prosperous with the quiet slow exploitation of the American continent , as manual labour slowly subdued its rivers , its forests , and its prairies . I am not concerned to deny that the result might have been happier , for the chariot of Phoebus is a dangerous  | vehicle . My only immediate thesis is that it would have been very different . The forms of the great works by which the minds of Galileo and Newton are best known to us bear plain evidence of the contrast between their situations . In his book entitled , The Two Systems of the World in Four Dialogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past ; whilst in his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy , published in 1687 , Newton ignores old adversaries and discussions , and , looking wholly to the future , calmly enunciates definitions , principles , and proofs which have ever since formed the basis of physical science . Galileo represents the assault and Newton the victory . There can be no doubt but that Galileo is the better reading . It is a real flesh and blood document of human nature which has wedged itself between the two austere epochs of Aristotelian Logic and Applied Mathematics . It was paid for also in the heart 's blood of the author . The catastrophe happened in this way : most unfortunately His Holiness , the reigning pope , in an entirely friendly interview after the Inquisition had forbidden the expression of Copernican opinions , made use of the irrefutable argument that , God being omnipotent , it was as easy for him to send the sun and the planets round the earth as to send the earth and the planets round the sun . How unfortunate it is that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the most earnest desire to understand each other , can not rid themselves of their presuppositions . The pope was trembling on the verge of the enunciation of the relativity of motion and of space , and in his Dialogues there are passages in which Galileo plainly expresses that same doctrine . But neither of them was sufficiently aware of the full emphasis to be laid upon that truth . Accordingly the  | next precious ten minutes of the conversation in which Galileo might have cleared away the little misunderstanding were wasted , and as a result there ensued for the world 's edification the persecution of Galileo and a clear illustration of the limits of infallibility . The true moral of the incident is the importance of great men keeping their tempers . Galileo was annoyed ? and very naturally so , for it was an irritating sort of argument with which to counter a great and saving formulation of scientific ideas . Unfortunately he went away and put the pope 's argument into the mouth of Simplicius , the man in the Dialogues who always advances the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the leading interlocutor , Salviatus ? I give it in the seventeenthcentury translation of Thomas Salusbury : This of yours is admirable , and truly angelical doctrine , to which very exactly that other accords in like manner divine , which whilst it giveth us leave to dispute , touching the constitution of the world , addeth withall ( perhaps to the end that the exercise of the minds of men might neither be discouraged nor made bold ) that we can not find out the works made by his hands . Let therefore the Disquisition permitted and ordained us by God , assist us in the knowing , and so much more admiring his greatness , by how much less we find ourselves too dull to penetrate the profound abysses of his infinite wisdom . ' At this point the Dialogues end . Galileo always protested that he had meant no discourtesy . But the pope , even if his infallibility tottered , was here assisted by the gift of prophecy and smelt Voltaire . Anyhow in his turn he lost his temper and afterwards remained the bitter enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way in which every hint which reached him is turned to account and immediately made to be of importance .  | He hears of the telescope as a curiosity discovered by a Dutch optician . It might have remained a toy , but in his hands it created a revolution . He at once thought out the principles on which it was based , improved upon its design so as to obviate the inversion of objects , and immediately applied it to a systematic survey of the heavens . The results were startling . It was not a few details that were altered , but an almost sacred sentiment which fell before it . I have often thought that the calmness with which the Church accepted Copernicus and its savage hostility to Galileo can only be accounted for by measuring the ravages made by the telescope on the sacred doctrine of the heavens . It was then seen too late that the Copernican doctrine was the key to the position . But Galileo 's Dialogues plainly show that it was not the movement of the earth but the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be remembered that the heaven , which Christ had taught is within us , was by the popular sentiment of mediaeval times placed above us . Accordingly when the telescope revealed the moon and other planets reduced to the measure of the earth , and the sun with evanescent spots , the shock to sentiment was profound . It is the characteristic of shocked sentiment in the case of men whose learning surpasses their genius that they begin to quote Aristotle . Accordingly Aristotle was hurled at Galileo . The Dialogues are the record of the contemporary dispute between Galileo and the current Aristotelian tradition , and the end of the discussion was the creation of the modern scientific outlook of which Galileo was the first perfect representative ? somewhat choleric but entirely whole-hearted . So far we have been endeavouring to appreciate the climate of opinions amid which Galileo 's life was passed ? and you will remember that no climate is composed of  | a succession of uniform days , especially in its spring-time . A judicious selection could affix almost any label to the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds is that at its beginning , so far as science was concerned , men knew hardly more than Aristotle and less than Archimedes , while at its end the main positions of modern science were firmly established . I will now endeavour to explain the main revolutionary ideas which Galileo impressed upon his contemporaries . The first one was the doctrine of the uniformity of the material universe . This doctrine is now so obvious to us that we can only think of it in the attenuated form of discussions on miracles or on the relations of mind and matter . But in Galileo 's time the denial of uniformity went much deeper than that . The different regions of Nature were supposed to function in entirely different ways . This presupposition led to a style of argument which is foreign to our ears . For example , here is a short speech of Simplicius , the upholder of the old Aristotelian tradition in Galileo 's Dialogues , chosen almost at random : Aristotle , though of a very perspicacious wit , would not strain it further than needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be preferred before any reasons founded upon strength of wit , and said those which should deny the testimony of sense deserved to be punished with the loss of that sense ; now who is so blind , that sees not the parts of the Earth and Water to move , as being grave , naturally downwards , namely , towards the centre of the Universe , assigned by nature herself for the end and term of right motion deorsum ; and loth not likewise see the Fire and Air to move right upwards towards the Concave of the Lunar Orb , as to the natural end of motion sursum ? And this being so manifestly seen , and we being certain , that eadem est ratio totius et partium , why may we not assert it for a true and manifest proposition , that the natural motion of the Earth is the right motion ad medium , and that of the Fire , the right a medio ?  | In this passage we note that different functions are assigned to the Centre of the Universe to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line , and to the Concave of the Lunar Orb ( to which Fire naturally moves in a straight line ) . The idea of the neutrality of situation and the universality of physical laws , regulating casual occurrences and holding indifferently in every part , is entirely absent . On the contrary , each local part of nature has its one peculiar function in the scheme of things . It is a fine conception : the only objection to it is that it does not seem to be true . I am not sure , however , that the Einstein conception of the physical forces as being due to the contortions of spacetime is not in some respects a return to it . But let us see how Galileo in the person of the interlocutor , Salviatus , answers this speech of Simplicius . His answer is somewhat long , and I only give the relevant part : ... Now , like as from the consentaneous conspiration of all the parts of the Earth to form its whole , cloth follow , that they with equal inclination concur thither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is possible together , they there physically adapt themselves ; why may we not believe that the Sun , Moon , and other mundane Bodies , be also of a round figure , not by other than a concordant instinct , and natural concourse of all the parts composing them ? Of which , if any , at any time , by any violence were separated from the whole , is it not reasonable to think , that they would spontaneously and by natural instinct return ? and in this manner to infer , that the right motion agreeth with all mundane bodies alike . Note that in this answer Galileo , in the person of Salviatus , entirely ignores any peculiar function or property to be assigned to a Centre of the Universe or to a Concave of the Lunar Orb . He has in his mind the conceptions of modern science , in that the Earth , the  | Moon , the Sun , and the other planets are all bodies moving in an indifferent neutral space , and each attracting its own parts to form its whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiration of all the parts of the Earth to form its whole ' . Evidently Galileo is very near to the Newtonian doctrine of Universal Gravitation . But he is not quite there . Newton enunciates the doctrine that every particle of matter attracts every other particle of matter in a certain definite way . Galileo ? as children say in the game of Hide-and-Seek ? is very hot in respect to this doctrine . But he does not seem , at least in this passage , to have made the final generalization . He is thinking particularly of the Earth , the Sun , the Moon , and other planets ? and his guardian angel does not appear to have whispered to him the generalization any material body ' . Newton probably knew Galileo 's Dialogues nearly by heart . They were standard works in his time . Can not we imagine him sitting in his rooms between the gateway and the chapel of Trinity College , or in the orchard watching the apple fall , and with this passage of Galileo 's Dialogue running in his mind , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted , the consentaneous conspiration of all the parts of the Earth to form its whole ' . Suddenly the idea flashes on him ? What are the Earth and the Sun and the Moon ? Why , they are any bodies ! We should say therefore that any bodies attract . But if this be the case , the Earth and the Sun and the Moon attract each other , and we have the cause maintaining the planets in their orbits . ' In this course of thought Newton would have been assisted by his third law of motion . For by it if the Earth attracts the apple , then the apple attracts the Earth . By this conjectural reconstruction of Newton 's state of mind we see that , given a genius with adequate  | mathematical faculties , Newton 's Principia is the next step in science after Galileo 's Dialogues . Probably Galileo himself would have gone farther in this direction if his imagination had not been hampered by the necessity of arguing with the Conservative Party . It is in general a mistake to waste time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads . But in Galileo 's time and country the Conservative Party had thumbscrews at its service and could thereby enforce a certain amount of attention to its ideas . Undoubtedly the whole implication of the answer of Salviatus is that the Earth , Sun , &c.,; are mere bits of matter . It is difficult for us to estimate how great an advance Galileo made in adumbrating this position . Consider for example this statement by Simplicius , made in another connexion , enforcing a doctrine which he upholds throughout the whole of the Dialogues : See here for a beginning , two most convincing arguments to demonstrate the Earth to be most different from the Ccelestial bodies . First , the bodies that are generable , corruptible , alterable , &c.,; are quite different from those that are ingenerable , incorruptible , unalterable , &c.; But the Earth is generable , corruptible , alterable , &c.,; and the Ccelestial bodies ingenerable , incorruptible , unalterable , &c.; Therefore the Earth is quite different from the Ccelestial bodies . That is the sort of thing that Galileo was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle reasoner , but as the very texture of current notions . The primary achievement of the first physical synthesis was to clear all this away . Galileo with his telescope , his trenchant , bold intellect , and his magnificent physical intuition was the man who did it . But we have not nearly exhausted Galileo 's contributions to the general ideas of science . We owe to Galileo the First Law of Motion . Probably most of us  | have in our minds Newton 's enunciation of this law , Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line except so far as it is compelled by impressed force to change that state . ' This is the first article of the creed of science ; and like the Church 's creeds it is more than a mere statement of belief : it is a paean of triumph over defeated heretics . It should be set to music and chanted in the halls of Universities . The defeated adversaries are the Aristotelians who for two thousand years imposed on Dynamics the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . true doctrine conceives uniform motion in a straight line as a state in which every body will naturally continue except so far as it is compelled by impressed force to change that state . Accordingly in Dynamics we search for a cause of the change of motion , namely either a change in respect to speed or a change in respect to direction of motion . For example , an Aristotelian investigating the motion of the planets in their orbits would seek for tangential forces to keep the planets moving ; but a follower of Galileo seeks for normal forces to deflect the direction of motion along the curved orbit . This is why Newton , at the moment which we pictured him as he sat in his rooms in Trinity College thinking about gravitation , at once saw that the attraction of the Sun was the required force . It was nearly normal to the orbits of the planets . Here again we see how immediately Newton 's physical ideas follow from those of Galileo . One genius completes the work of the other . It has been stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Systems of the World Galileo does not enunciate the first law of motion , and that it only appears in his subsequent Dialogues on Mechanics . This may be formally true so far as a neat decisive statement is concerned . But in essence the first law of motion is  | presupposed in the argumentation of the earlier dialogues . The whole explanation why loose things are not left behind as the Earth moves depends upon it . Galileo also prepared the way for Newton 's final enunciation of the Laws of Motion by his masterly investigation of the uniform acceleration of falling bodies on the Earth 's surface and his demonstration that this acceleration is independent of the relative weights of the bodies , except so far as extraneous retarding forces are concerned . He swept away the old classification of natural and violent motions as founded on trivial unessential differences , and left the way entirely open for Newton 's final generalizations . Newton conceived explicitly the idea of a neutral absolute space within which all motion is to be construed , and of mass as a permanent intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of matter . He phrased this concept in the definition , mass is quantity of matter . He then conceived the true measure of force as being the product of the mass of the body into its rate of change of velocity . The importance of this conception lies in the fact that force as thus conceived is found to depend on simple physical conditions , such as mass , electric and magnetic charges , electric currents , and distances . We owe to Newton the final formulation of the basic physical ideas which have served science so well during these last two centuries . They comprise the foundations of the science of Dynamics , and Law of Gravitation . We also owe to Galileo 's experimental genius the telescope and its first systematic use in science , the pendulum clock ( subsequently perfected by Huyghens ) and the experimental demonstration of the laws of falling bodies . To Newton 's mathematical genius we owe the deduction of the properties of the planetary orbits from dynamical principles . To Galileo and Newton  | we must add the name of Kepler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bruges so far as mechanics is concerned . He discovered the famous triangle of forces . But in one lecture lasting one hour you will not expect me to give a detailed account of the science of the seventeenth century . In like manner we must add the name of Huyghens in mentioning the services of Galileo and Newton to the science of Optics . Huyghens first suggested the undulatory theory of light , to be revived at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Thomas Young and Fresnel . But the immediately fruitful work was due to Galileo with his studies on the theory of the telescope , and to Newton with his studies on the theory of colour . Both Dynamics and Optics reached Galileo as a series of detached truths ( or falsehoods ) loosely connected . After the work of Galileo and Newton they emerged as wellknit sciences on firm foundations . Galileo 's preoccupation with Optics doubtless helped him to another great idea which has coloured all modern thought . Light is transmitted through space from its origin by paths which may be devious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it enters your eye . You may see a green leaf behind the looking-glass ; but the leaf is really behind your head and you are really looking at its image in the mirror . Thus the green which you see is not the property of the leaf , but it is the result of the stimulation of the nerves of the retina by the light which enters the eye . These considerations led Descartes and Locke to elaborate the idea of external nature consisting of matter moving in space and with merely primary qualities . These primary qualities are its shape , its degree of hardness and cohesiveness , its massiveness , and its attractive effects and its resilience . Our perceptions of nature such as colour , sound , taste and  | smell , and sensations of heat and cold form the secondary qualities . These secondary qualities are merely mental projections which are the result of the stimulation of the brain by the appropriate nerves . Such in outline is the famous theory of primary and secondary qualities in the form in which it has held the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of essential service in directing scientific investigation into fruitful fields both of physics and physiology . Now the credit for its first sketch is due to Galileo . Here is an extract from Galileo 's work , Il Saggiatore , published in 1624 . I take it from the English life of Galileo by J. J. Fahie 1 : ' I have now only to fulfil my promise of declaring my opinions on the proposition that motion is the cause of heat , and to explain in what manner it appears to me that it may be true . But I must first make some remarks on that which we call heat , since I strongly suspect that a notion of it prevails which is very remote from the truth ; for it is believed that there is a true accident , affection , or quality , really inherent in the substance by which we feel ourselves heated . This much I have to say , that as soon as I form a conception of a material or corporeal substance , I simultaneously feel the necessity of conceiving that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that relatively to others it is great or small ; that it is in this or that place , in this or that time ; that it is in motion or at rest ; that it touches , or does not touch another body ; that it is unique , rare , or common ; nor can I , by any act of imagination , disjoin it from these qualities ; but I do not find myself absolutely compelled to apprehend it as necessarily accompanied by such conditions as that it must be white or red , bitter or sweet , sonorous or silent , smelling sweetly or disagreeably ; and if the senses had not pointed out these qualities , i Published by Murray , London , 1903.  | it is probable that language and imagination alone could never have arrived at them . Therefore I am inclined to think that these tastes , smells , colours , &c.,; with regard to the object in which they appear to reside , are nothing more than mere names , and exist only in the sensitive body ; insomuch that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and annihilated ; although we have imposed particular names upon them ( different from those other and real accidents ) , and would fain persuade ourselves that they truly and in fact exist . But I do not believe that there exists anything in external bodies for exciting tastes , smells and sounds , but size , shape , quantity , and motion , swift or slow ; and if ears , tongues , and noses were removed , I am of opinion that shape , quantity , and motion would remain , but there would be an end of smells , tastes , and sounds , which , abstractedly from the living creature , I take to be mere words . ' If we knew nothing else about Galileo except that in the October of the year 1623 he published this extract , we should know for certain that a man of the highest philosophic genius then existed . On the subject of this extract , he leaves nothing for Descartes and Locke to do , except to repeat his statement in their own language , and to emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement by Galileo is , as I believe , more accurately and carefully drawn than the usual formulations of modern times which I followed in my introductory remark . I will now quit the special consideration of Galileo and Newton . I hope that I have with sufficient clearness given my reasons for holding that they are to be considered as the parents of modern science and as the joint authors of the first physical synthesis . You can not disentangle their work . There would have been no Newton without Galileo ; and it is hardly a paradox to  | say , that there would have been no . Galileo without Newton . Galileo was the Julius Caesar and Newton the Augustus Caesar of the empire of science . But these men did not work in a vacuum . It was an age of ferment , and they had as contemporaries men with genius all but equal to theirs . Francis Bacon was a contemporary of Galileo , somewhat older ( 1561-1626 ) . I need not remind you that Bacon was the apostle of the experimental method . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a careful and prolonged examination of the facts . Like all apostles he somewhat exaggerated his message , and perhaps undervalued the importance of provisional theories . But the main point is perfectly correct and particularly important in view of the tradition of the preceding 1500 years , during which experiment had languished . Aristotle had discovered the importance of classification , and neither he nor his followers had realized the danger of classification proceeding on slight and trivial grounds . The greatest curse to the progress of science is a hasty classification based on trivialities . An example of what I mean is Aristotle 's classification of motions into violent and natural . Bacon 's writings were a continual protest against this pitfall . Again the active life of Descartes lies between those of Galileo and Newton . He published his Principia Philosophiae in 1644 , just two years after the date which I have assigned as the symbolic centre of the epoch . The general concepts of space and matter , body and spirit , as they have per.neated the scientific world , are largely in accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a property of matter and therefore rejected the idea of purely empty space . This conception of space as an essential plenum led him to speculate on the other physical characteristics of the stuff whose extension is space . He thus hit on the idea of the vortices which  | carry along the heavenly bodies . These vortices are a failure . For one thing , they show that Descartes had not really assimilated the full import of Galileo 's work in his discovery of the first law of motion . The planets do not want anything to carry them along , and that is just what Descartes provides . But for all that I hold that Descartes with his plenum was groping towards a very important truth which I will endeavour to explain before I finish this lecture . Newton 's formulation of gravitation led Newton 's followers to . insist on the possibility of a vacuum , but the nineteenth century again filled space with an ether . Finally Einstein has recurred to the inversion of Descartes ' doctrine and has made matter a property of space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very equal duel during the last few centuries . Leibniz , Newton 's contemporary , emphasized the relativity of space . This mention of relativity leads me to my last topic , which is to ask , how to-day we would criticize this First Physical Synthesis which we owe to the seventeenth century . In the first place , if we are wise , before criticizing it we will stop to admire it , and to note its essential services to science , and ( in its main outlines ) its continuing value to-day . We must do honour to the century of genius to which we owe it ? a century which will compare with the greatest that Greece can show . By a criticism of the great physical synthesis which is the legacy of this century to science I do not mean a mere enumeration of the additions since made , for example , the rise of the concept of energy , of the atomic theory , or of the theory of various chemical elements . Such homogeneous additions leave the concept undisturbed . In this way , Kelvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for the last thirty years or  | so , the great ideas of the seventeenth century have , so to speak , been losing their dominating grip on physical science . Clerk-Maxwell probably thought that he had finally established its ascendancy . In truth , he had set going trains of thought which in the hands of his followers have caused it to totter . Galileo and his followers thought in terms of time , space , and matter . They were in fact more Aristotelian than they knew ? though they wore their Aristotle with a difference . Clerk-Maxwell emphasized the importance of the electromagnetic field as an interplay of relations between various electromagnetic quantities . Maxwell himself looked on this field as merely expressing strains , stresses , and motions of the ether , a point of view quite in the Galilean tradition . But recently the field itself has come to be conceived as the ultimate fact , and properties of matter have been explained in terms of it . Thus energy , mass , matter , chemical elements are now expressed as electromagnetic phenomena . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it merely serves to allay the tortures of a metaphysical craving . But Einstein and Minkowski have gone farther . Hitherto time and space have been treated as separate and independent factors in the scheme of things . They have combined them . This is a complete refashioning of older ideas and is in many ways much more consonant with the Cartesian point of view . The world as we observe it involves process and extension . Hitherto process has been identified with serial time , and extension with space . But this neglects the fact that there is an extension of time . Conceive any ultimate concrete fact as an extended process . If you have lost process or lost extension , you know that you are dealing with abstraction . What is going on here in this room is extended process . Extension and process are each  | abstractions . But these abstractions can be made in different ways . The space which we apprehend as extension without process and the time which we apprehend as serial process without spatial extension are not each unique . In different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and different meanings to the correlative notion of time . In respect to space there is no paradox in this assertion . For us the space of this room is a definite volume ; for a man in the sun the room is sweeping through space . But it is paradoxical to hold that the serial process which we apprehend as time is different from the serial process which the man in the sun apprehends as time . Yet if you do that , you can introduce mathematical formulae expressing spatiotemporal measurements which at one sweep explain a whole multitude of perplexing scientific observation . In fact the formulae practically have to be admitted , and the theory is the simplest explanation of them . Also philosophically the closer association of time and space is a great advantage . We now come back to Descartes . He conceived extension as essentially a quality of matter . Generalize his idea : the ultimate fact is not static matter but the flux of physical existence : call any part of this flux , with all its fullness of content and happening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so is process . But the becomingness of nature is not to be constricted within one serial linear procession of time . It requires an indefinite number of such processions to express the complete vision . If this line of thought , which is that underlying the modern relativity , be admitted , the whole synthesis of the seventeenth century has to be recast . Its Time , its Space , and its Matter are in the melting-pot ? and there we must leave them .  | SCIENCE IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION CECIL H. DESCH To study the share of science in bringing about the great social change towards the end of the eighteenth century that we know as the Industrial Revolution is to turn from a time when science was the concern of a few intellectual leaders , and occasionally the amusement of a group of amateurs , to one when it came to affect the life of every member , even the least instructed , of the Western communities . It is to turn from isolated experiments in the harnessing of the forces of Nature to man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the service of industry . We may observe the distinction that has been drawn between the industrial and the mechanical revolution , closely connected in history though they are . There is much evidence to show that the transition from domestic workshops to factories , and from small-scale handicrafts to capitalist production , was in course of taking place independently of machines , but the whole movement was hastened and intensified to a most remarkable extent by the new mastery of nature that came with the introduction of coal as a metallurgical fuel and with the invention of the steam engine . These two great inventions led to a complete transformation of industry . Not only was its character radically changed , but the distribution of population was altered by the establishment of the growing industries on the coal fields , ignoring previous historical conditions ,  | so that new centres of dense population grew up , hastily and without forethought , presenting those undesirable features that we commonly associate with the idea of the industrial revolution . For the moment we have only to deal with the main outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of science . We should be wrong to suppose that organized industry on a large scale was a new thing in the history of the world . The canal system of Babylonia , the pyramids of Egypt , the great aqueducts of Roman cities , were achievements in construction comparable with any but the greatest works of modern times , demanding not only a vast supply of human labour , which the institution of slavery made possible , but a high degree of engineering knowledge and skill . It is difficult to picture the task of the ancient engineer , with primitive surveying instruments , cumbrous methods of calculation , and only the rudest of mechanical appliances for handling large masses of material . Nevertheless , the results achieved were marvellous , and modern engineers are beginning to study , with renewed interest , the methods adopted by their predecessors of Egypt and Rome . Neither was their work purely empirical . The ancient studies of geometry and physics were originally directed to practical ends , and some of the most important ancient discoveries in abstract science arose from attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the engineer . Simple mechanical devices which form the basis of elaborate mechanisms , such as the wheel and the lever , were known and commonly applied , whilst the labours of Archimedes and others had established the quantitative laws of some of them , notably of the lever . At a later date , the sea defences of Venice and Holland , which made it possible for those states to rise to power and commercial importance in spite of geographically unfavourable con-  | ditions , may be named along with the great engineering works of Rome . We may place the Pyramids , as royal tombs , in a class apart , but all the other structures named had the character of public works , carried out under the authority of states or cities for the benefit of the general body of citizens . The mediaeval cathedrals are a most wonderful example of such co-operative work on a large scale , combining majesty of conception , skill in constructional design , and resourcefulness in overcoming technical difficulties . It was not new for large numbers of men to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliances for the purpose , but it was new for goods for the market to be produced in this way . Capitalism was not new ; contractors were often responsible for the undertaking of those great works of ancient times , and certain industries , such as iron smelting , were capitalistic in their organization from early times , but the production of ordinary goods in quantity for private profit was , with some exceptions , unknown before the eighteenth century .. At that time , the textile industries and a few others started their new career , to be hastened almost inconceivably in their transformation before the century was out by the application of improved machines and more efficient mechanical power . The spirit of invention , again , which seems to us so typical of the industrial revolution , was no new thing in human history . Among the Greeks , such legends as that of Daedalus commemorate the inventors of new crafts , of casting and hammering metals , of erecting buildings , and of constructing military engines . Hero of Alexandria , with his primitive steam engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military devices , is a witness to the existence of the capacity for designing elaborate mechanisms in the first century A. D. , and Vitruvius , in the same century , in his descriptions of cranes and machines , now  | and then seems oddly to anticipate modern inventions , as when he describes a taxicab , the distance travelled by a chariot being measured by the number of balls dropped into a bowl , each ball being released after a certain number of revolutions of the wheels . To come to later times , Leonardo da Vinci , one of the most marvellous men of genius in history , was a most fertile inventor , and his note-books , most of which have only become known recently , contain sketches and designs of machines for the most varied purposes . I need only mention a machine for cutting the teeth of files , an operation even now largely performed by hand . Many inventors , from Hero to Vaucanson , busied themselves with the construction of ingenious automata , imitating the action of men or animals , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention . None of these inventions had any appreciable influence on industry . In looking for an explanation of this , we may note that , with the exception of Leonardo da Vinci , who was far.in advance of his time , so that his projects could not be carried out until industry had made much further progress , inventors had confined themselves to two main classes of objects . Either their machines were built up of timbers , with at most small connecting parts of metal , like the military engines , storming towers and catapults of the ancients , or the water wheels of mediaeval industry , or they were delicate mechanisms , like the automata of Vaucanson , calling for ingenuity and dexterity , but making no severe demands on the strength or quality of the materials used in them . Machines of the modern kind only become possible when the art of working large masses of metal has reached a high state of development . Broadly speaking , this was not the case before the latter part of the eighteenth century . There have been exceptions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to pillars and simple beams , still excite our admiration , and the art of casting bronze for statuary arrived at extraordinary perfection even in early Greek times , and was preserved and perfected by the great German and Italian masters of the Renaissance , as Peter Vischer of Nuremberg and Benvenuto Cellini . The casting of iron was limited to comparatively small masses , cannon being the largest , and forging to still smaller masses , such as could be dealt with by a tilt hammer worked by water power . The metallurgical revolution had to precede the mechanical , and it was not until iron could be handled in quantity with ease and certainty that a machine , however ingenious , had a chance of becoming a practical success . The smelting of iron had been performed from prehistoric times in a simple manner , by heating the ore with charcoal in a primitive furnace , urged to a sufficiently high temperature by a blast , the bellows being driven by hand or later by water power . With only slight modifications , this process persisted for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for small quantities , and the special skill required for the operation combined with certain elements in social tradition to place the smith in a place apart , as is shown by legends and folk-tales in many countries . From the time of the Romans onwards , the process was improved by almost imperceptible steps , due to inventors of whom we know next to nothing . The most that we can do is to trace , partly in documents but chiefly in such material remains as the destructive action of time has left to us , the passage of a new metallurgical process across Europe . Some of the most important improvements in the smelting of iron probably came to us from the Walloon country in the east of Belgium . A few men of real scientific ability devoted themselves to the study of metals , chief amongst them being Georg  | Bauer or Agricola , to whom we owe a magnificent treatise , published in 1556 , in which we have clearly set forth the processes of mining and smelting then in use , with such scientific explanations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook , and his rejection of alchemy and of all far-fetched theories of the origin of minerals in'itself entitles him to an honourable place in the history of science . For a complete understanding of metallurgical processes a knowledge of chemistry is necessary , so that a truly scientific control of the industry was not possible until much later . To fix our ideas , we may consider the state of the English iron industry in the latter part of the sixteenth century . The principal region was the Weald , most of the works lying in Sussex , with extensions into Surrey and Kent . Here blast furnaces , worked by means of charcoal , made the cast iron , and when malleable material was wanted , the same fuel was used for the conversion . Water power was necessary to blow the furnaces and to drive the forging hammers . The consumption of wood for charcoal was large , so that even in 1558 a statute was passed to prevent the destruction of forests for this purpose . At first Sussex was exempted , but later the prohibition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forest of Dean , another old smelting centre , took place . There was a constant strife between the claims of the State , which required timber especially for shipbuilding purposes , and the needs of the growing iron industry . By the beginning of the eighteenth century the scarcity of wood in England was so serious that the ironmasters of the Furness district of Cumberland were erecting works in the Scottish Highlands , where timber was still to be found and the restrictions did not apply . In the face of these difficulties , it is not surprising that attempts were made to replace charcoal by coal , already  | long a familiar domestic fuel . Dud Dudley , in the middle of the seventeenth century , was the most successful of these experimenters , but the jealousy of his rivals put an end to his work , and it was not until 1757 that coal , previously converted into coke , was successfully used in blast furnaces at Coalbrookedale in Shropshire , where also the first cast-iron bridge and the first iron rails for mine trams , in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning-point in industrial history . The greater cheapness and facility of coal made the manufacture of iron ( steel was still only made on a very small scale ) possible , and thus began the migration of industry to the coal-fields , which has led to the present distribution of the population , so different from that of the era preceding coal . The time was now ripe for the mechanical revolution . Mechanical power , for driving corn-mills and forge hammers , for blowing furnaces , and for grinding cutlery , had been hitherto derived from the wind or from the fall of water to a lower level . The wind is too variable to be applied widely , and windmills are only possible in flat countries ; but water power has wide applications . We can imagine how a great industrial civilization might have grown up , organized for production on a large scale , and based on water power . The use of the water-wheel was common throughout Europe , and the extension would have been a natural one . The damming of streams to form hammer ponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron-working districts , and the corn-mill has been a feature of agricultural life for centuries . But practical difficulties stood in the way of any such development . The very power of great waterfalls , such as the Falls of the Rhine at Schaffhausen , made it impossible to utilize them . The simple water-wheel , built up of timbers , however skilfully constructed , would have been  | crushed by the mass of falling water , and all that man could do with such a source of power was to lead off some minute fraction through a channel to supply a single wheel . Only a modern turbine , scientifically designed to take the full force of the water , and constructed of materials of exceptional strength , can serve in such a case , and for that neither the knowledge nor the means existed . Had the invention of the water turbine preceded that of the steam engine , the geographical distribution of industry would have been far other than it is . The other great natural sources of power ? the tides and the direct heat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own day . Thus , of the natural sources of power now known to us , there only remained the combustion of fuel . To convert the chemical energy of wood or coal into mechanical energy is not directly practicable , and the suggestion would never have occurred to an early inventor , since the very conception of energy , and of the mutual equivalence of different kinds of energy , did not arise until after the date of the industrial revolution . We may consider the scientific knowledge that was available in the period immediately before the invention of the steam engine . The laws of statics , the simplest of which had been established by Archimedes both for solids and for liquids , were extended by Stevin of Bruges and later by Galileo , who is also the true founder of dynamics . The great work of Newton had brought mechanics to such a state of perfection that the most difficult problems in connexion with bodies at rest or in motion could be solved , with the aid of the new mathematical methods due to Napier , Descartes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of more recent origin . Ctesibius of Alexandria , the teacher of Hero , is credited with the first ' scientific studies of air and steam , and the expansive force of gases  | was known to him , but it is with the work of Torricelli and Boyle that a firm foundation for a knowledge of the properties of gases , including steam , is first apparent . Boyle , one of the most brilliant of that group of men who established the Royal Society , and so gave practical form to the new creed of experiment as the true means of investigating Nature that was making its way in England , added more than any other man to our knowledge in this field . By discovering the relation between the volume of a gas and the pressure to which it was subjected , he made it possible to define quantitatively the behaviour of an enclosed volume of gas under different conditions . The scientific knowledge required for the construction of a simple steam engine was in existence by the middle of the seventeenth century , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hero of Alexandria had been a machine , capable of performing simple motions , which depended on the expansion of air in a partly closed vessel , forcing water into another vessel , and it was this contrivance that formed the model for the earlier inventors . Della Porta in 16o1 replaced air by steam , and suggested that the condensation of the steam might be utilized in drawing up water from below . De Caus and the Marquis of Worcester suggested similar machines , pumps rather than engines , intended for the lifting of water , but none of these ever assumed practical shape . It was not until 1698 that Thomas Savery made a working steam engine on this principle , involving several ingenious details , and finding direct application in the pumping of water from mines , a question then beginning to assume importance . As the metallurgical demand for coal increased , shallow workings became insufficient , and miners were prevented from working at greater depths by the accumulation of water in the  | mines . Savery 's engine worked with pressures sometimes as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from leakage . In principle it was not unlike the modern pulsometer pump . Denis Papin in 1690 adopted an entirely different principle . The use of a piston moving in a cylinder was already familiar in the common suction pump , and Papin , by condensing steam in the lower part of the cylinder , caused the piston to descend by atmospheric pressure . Huygens had shortly before proposed an explosion engine with piston , a crude forerunner of the modern internal combustion engine . Neither had any - practical consequences . Newcomen , in 1705 , constructed a steam pumping engine which held the field for the greater part of the century . He used a piston , but made the boiler for generating steam a separate vessel from the cylinder , and brought about the condensation of the steam by admitting a jet of water . The piston rod moved one end of a beam , to the other end of which was attached the pump rod , and in this form , the movement of the necessary valves soon being made automatic by connecting them with the beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from mines . One is even now in use in the Sheffield district . Many of these engines were built at Coalbrookdale . Great strength was not required , as the pressure never differed greatly from that of the atmosphere . So far the engines had all been examples of mechanical ingenuity , involving no new principles , and based only on the simplest mechanics . The next great step was not taken at random , but was the result of the application of new principles . James Watt was much more than a merely ingenious mechanic . Skilled workman as he was , he was the close friend of two active investigators in physics , Black and Robison , and with them and others  | of like intellectual standing he discussed his inventions . Struck by the inefficiency and wastefulness of the Newcomen engine , he rightly saw that this came from the alternate heating and cooling of the cylinder . Black 's discovery of latent heat had shown how large a quantity of heat is released when steam is condensed to water , and Watt , applying this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the condensing vessel . This is not a memoir on the steam engine , and it is impossible to enter into the wonderful record of Watt as an inventor , adding detail after detail until the crude steam pump had been converted into an efficient engine , the reciprocating action of the piston being converted into rotary motion by means of the crank , so making it possible to employ the steam engine to drive machinery in a factory or , as was done later , to fix it into a boat for steam navigation , or on wheels as a locomotive . Subsequent developments , remarkable as they have been , are essentially matters of detail . Before leaving this subject , a suggestion of Giovanni Branca in 1629 may be mentioned . This was to direct a jet of steam against the vanes of a wheel , and so produce rotation . This suggestion bore no fruit , but it is interesting in the light of recent mechanical history . Many inventors from time to time reverted to the idea of a steam turbine , but the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engine was a practical difficulty , whilst the principles were yet unknown . The theory of the heat engine , according to which the maximum efficiency of the most perfect engine is limited by the temperatures between which it works , was only established in 1824 , by Sadi Carnot . Carnot showed that heat does work when it falls from a higher level ( of temperature ) to a lower , but that an equivalent quantity of heat disappears in the process was not realized until the  | establishment of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in 1843 and succeeding years , by the labours of Joule , Mayer , and Helmholtz . It is this doctrine that controls the efforts of modern inventors , and makes immediately evident the absurdity of proposals to increase the amount of energy in a system without taking it from somewhere else . A lack of comprehension of this principle is responsible for many fallacious suggestions . The steam turbine is a quite modern invention , scarcely forty years old , and is based on a most thorough study of the properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in its construction . It could never have been arrived at by a process of happy guessing , or of trial and error . Watt 's engine could not have been constructed at an earlier period . It was not a pump , but an engine in the modern sense , and required not only relatively large masses of metal , but accurate casting and boring , things that could not yet be obtained . On reading the life of Watt , one is struck by the great practical obstacles that confronted him at every stage . Although his early engines were atmospheric , depending on the vacuum produced by condensing the steam for their action , so that high pressures were unnecessary , his cylinders had to be large to give sufficient power , and even when the casting difficulties had been overcome there was the difficulty of boring the cylinder so that the piston would make a reasonably tight fit . Gradually , Watt and his associates triumphed over their difficulties , and after many years of effort and discouragement the steam engine became the agent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand for engines for pumping , on account of their large consumption of coal , made it possible for the engines to be constructed . The Carron works in Scotland , with which  | Watt was associated through Roebuck , assisted him in the manufacture of them as well as by making use of them when made . In the meantime a revolution in the manufacture of textile materials had been going on in this country . Hargreaves , Arkwright , and Crompton had invented machines , depending on no new principle , but ingeniously combining simple mechanical movements , which could replace hand labour and allow of the production of textile fabrics on an enormously increased scale . Whilst the machines were at first driven by water power , and the mills were therefore placed near to streams having a sufficient fall , the usefulness of steam power for the purpose was soon obvious , and in 1785 the first steam cotton mill was set to work in Nottingham . Factory production on a large scale was first adopted in the metal industry . The iron and steel works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1682 . There had been textile capitalists employing as many persons much earlier , but their workers were scattered through small domestic workshops , and not collected into a single factory . With the invention of power machinery for spinning and weaving textiles came the organization of that industry also on a factory plan , and the engineering industry followed as a consequence . The change having once set in proceeded with everincreasing velocity , until the present conditions of industry were reached . In the great majority of manufactures , machine production has superseded hand work , whilst the immense developments of mechanical transport have transformed the conditions of industrial life throughout . Not all industries were affected to an equal extent . As we have seen , the invention and construction of the steam engine and of the machinery for textiles demanded  | knowledge which was supplied by the sciences of mechanics and physics , already sufficiently advanced by the middle of the eighteenth century . Scientific chemistry is only considered to date from the time of Lavoisier , so that the transformation of the chemical industries , formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only now in progress . Agriculture was improved , but for any radical transformation a scientific knowledge of biology was needed , and that is of quite modern growth . We are still only perceiving the firstfruits of the systematic application of biological science to agriculture , a reformation which may well transform rural life , and to some extent counteract the evil influences of the industrial revolution . Those evils were immense . The introduction of steam power almost immediately opened the way to the rapid and cheap production of many classes of goods . It was found that large profits could be made by employing labour in great factories . Competition became intense , and to secure a remunerative share of any manufacture the costs of production had to be kept as low as possible , hence the misery and cruelty of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . Unfortunately , the growth of facilities for manufacture was far too rapid for the essential social readjustments to keep pace with it , and evils accumulated fast . Moreover , the new discoveries came at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of a low standard . Even admirers of the eighteenth century must admit that a selfish complacency was characteristic of much of its life , and that the influence of religion on morality was then at its lowest ebb . It may seem a paradox that the Methodist movement and the Evangelical revival did practically nothing to counteract the selfishness of the new industrial era . It is remarkable that even Hannah More , in her accounts of her  | endeavours to promote a knowledge of the Bible among the poor , scarcely betrays a suspicion that the condition of the industry of her time , with its appalling misery for a large proportion of the workers , was anything but a natural and inevitable state of affairs , and her complacent reflections on the good fortune of the rich are to a modern reader strangely heartless . The fact is that the new religious fervour was so directly and intensely concerned with a future life that its influence in improving the conditions of this world was almost insignificant . A curious narrowness is perceptible in the attitude of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat later date . The leaders of the movement for the abolition of the slave trade , with a few honourable exceptions , took little notice of the virtual slavery and misery of the industrial population of our own country . The influence of the churches and the sects was small , and when the means of acquiring wealth rapidly presented themselves , there was no restraining force of adequate strength to oppose the greed of the new industrial chiefs . Dickens 's Mr. Gradgrind , although later in date , is a typical figure of the age . Suitably controlled , we can picture a mechanical revolution which would have rendered life infinitely happier , by improving comfort and lessening toil , without imposing a practical slavery on large masses of workers , or converting great tracts of beautiful country into hideous wildernesses , as has been the case in the north . Mr. Austin Freeman has made a good point in remarking that the introduction of machinery , whilst it has destroyed many handicrafts and turned many classes of skilled craftsmen into soulless machines , has done but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are still employed in the roughest of mechanical tasks that might well be performed by machines , and the housewife has derived little  | benefit in her daily toil from all the inventions of the mechanical age . This is true , and whilst it emphasizes some of the lessons preached so eloquently and so fruitlessly by Ruskin , it points a way to possible reforms in the future . One of the worst features of the industrial revolution is the wasteful treatment of natural resources . In the first enthusiasm of the discovery of steam power , it seemed that Nature had placed in the hands of Man an inexhaustible source of wealth . Coal was abundant in England , and the idea of its possible exhaustion did not present itself to the minds of those who used it . Whole counties were laid waste in order that goods might be produced cheaply , whilst smoke and slag heaps were allowed to disfigure the country . Professor Geddes has rightly said that the industrial age must be divided into two , a Palaeotechnic and a Neotechnic Age , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good subordinated to private gain , whilst in the second those conditions are reversed . We are only now seeing the beginnings of the Neotechnic Age . It would be wrong to blame science for the evils of industrialism . It was scientific discovery , misapplied in practice , that made those evils possible , but the spirit of industrial greed was not that of science . In another aspect , also , it was the imperfection of science that led to its misapplication . The waste of natural resources could hardly have been so great had the idea of the conservation of energy been present to men 's minds . It was of later growth , and was not in time to prevent the evils . Even now it is so little comprehended by the ordinary man of business that his actions are hardly affected by it . Further , the scientific study of human physiology came too late to warn men of the consequences of the unhealthy conditions of industrial life , whilst the  | fact that social science had not yet come into existence was the most potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized the system . Science , that is , the mechanics and physics of the time of Watt , might have been used to increase the sum of human happiness , and it is not the fault of science that it was not so used . Science is not responsible for its misuse by selfish men . In the last few years the cry has again been raised that materialistic science is responsible for the horrors of war , because chemistry and physics have been applied to the production of more destructive and crueller means of warfare . The danger of such misapplication still exists , and has to be reckoned with . One of the great aims of physical science of the present day is to discover a means of tapping the vast store of energy contained within the atom , and revealed to us by the phenomena of radioactivity . As Professor Soddy , one of the leading workers in that field , has remarked , the first application of that discovery , should it be made , would undoubtedly be the invention of a bomb , incomparably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , but it can not be allowed to hinder scientific investigation . The same discovery might be used to alleviate the hardships of life and to bring about a happier social state , and we must look to the control and not to the suppression of invention for a remedy for the evils of misapplied science . At the same time as the discoveries in mechanics and in the properties of gases , a new force was being studied , the knowledge of which was not to bear fruit until much later . It was in the year 1600 that William Gilbert , a court physician to Queen Elizabeth , published his treatise on the Magnet , in which for the first time experiments on electricity and magnetism were carefully described . This great work laid the foundation of a new  | science , but for more than two centuries that science grew slowly , and even the brilliant discoveries of Franklin , Cavendish , and Volta had no immediate practical consequences for industry . The discoveries of Oersted and Ampere led to the invention of the electric telegraph ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest experimenters in the whole history of science , established the principal laws of electromagnetism , that industrial applications of electricity became possible . The dynamo and the electric motor , with their more recent companion , the electric furnace , are the instruments of a new mechanical revolution taking place before our eyes , but of which only our descendants will see the full results . Electrical power will be the chief practical means of bringing about the change from the palaeotechnic to the neotechnic age . One feature of its influence is to be remarked in the geographical redistribution of industries , especially in the transference of some of them from the coal-fields to the mountainous regions where water power is abundant , with the attendant possibility of making a fresh start , untrammelled by the surroundings of a palaeotechnic industrial region . We may note in passing , although it belongs to a later period than that of the introduction of the steam engine , that electrical invention has pursued a rather different course from mechanical invention . Whilst the design of new mechanical devices has often been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error , the underlying scientific principles being established later ? the steam engine was a practical success before the theory of heat engines was worked out by Carnot ? the practical applications of electricity have followed on the theory Wireless telegraphy was not the result of a happy guess or of a process of trial and error , but was a direct application of a theoretical prediction of Clerk-Maxwell , tested  | experimentally by Hertz . The thermionic valve , which has made wireless telephony possible , is a consequence of purely scientific investigations on the emission of electrons from heated bodies ? investigations apparently remote from any practical applications . Electrical inventions are historically more recent than mechanical , and it is probable that the course of their history will be the normal one in the future , invention following on theory instead of preceding it . The time has passed when a happy guess may result in an epoch-making discovery . The growth of mechanical industry became more and more rapid as the years of the nineteenth century passed . Two factors in that growth may be selected or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rise of the chemical industries . Whilst , in the period that has been considered , iron was made on a large scale in the blast furnace by the use of coke , such steel as was required was manufactured on a relatively small scale , Huntsman 's crucible process of 1740 being used for the greater part of the production until the middle of the nineteenth century . Then two great inventions , that of Bessemer and that of Siemens and Martin , revolutionized the industry . The two were almost simultaneous , but the former sooner became a practical success . By blowing air through pig iron in a suitable vessel , a quantity of iron weighing several tons could be converted into steel in twenty minutes , and the scale of production increased almost immediately . From this point onwards the curve which shows the annual production of steel rises with increasing steepness until 1913 . The SiemensMartin , or open-hearth process , . was slower in making its way , but is now in this country by far the more important , and is everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel , which was about loo , 000 tons in 1848 , was about 76,000,000 tons in 1913 . These  | vast quantities of cheap material have transformed the construction of buildings , bridges , and ships , and we now live in a veritable Steel Age . Metallurgical chemistry has added a wide range of alloy steels , containing nickel , chromium , tungsten , and other metals , to the materials available to the engineer , surpassing the older steel and iron in strength and elastic qualities , and so making possible the construction of the motor-car and the aeroplane . The chemical industries are essentially of modern growth . The great alkali industry , the foundation of all the others , began with the invention of the Leblanc soda process in 1791 , and soon found a home in England , where it flourished . Popular attention , however , has been more constantly directed towards that part of the chemical industry which deals with artificial dyes and drugs , the industry of coal-tar products . Scientific chemists having shown the presence of definite chemical compounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first coloured compound , mauve , was prepared from it by Perkin in 1856 , since when the industry has reached an extraordinary development , many thousands of compounds having been prepared , including a wide range of synthetic colouring matters and therapeutic agents , and of such minor but yet important substances as photographic developers . The virtual capture of the industry by Germany , owing to the employment of an army of chemical investigators by the manufacturers , has caused a widespread interest in its fortunes , its social and political importance being quite disproportionate to its magnitude , which is far below that of other branches of industry . The coal-tar products have formed the text of many a homily on the importance of scientific education , but it must not be forgotten that its lessons are equally applicable to many other industries , which can only flourish and grow when scientifically controlled . Unfortunately , the manufacture of synthetic chemicals  | involves more than the production of dyes and drugs . Modern high explosives belong to the same class and are derived from the same source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have increased efficiency and diminished danger , they have made warfare more deadly and have enormously increased its scale . So , too , the knowledge of many compounds prepared in the laboratory and remarked for their noxious qualities led to the introduction in the great war of ' poison gases ' , the last refinement of horror in fighting . These are among the misuses to which all scientific discoveries are liable to be put , as long as the general conscience is insufficiently powerful to control them . Closely allied to explosives , however , are the artificial fertilisers by means of which the yield of cereals and other crops can be so largely increased . By combining the experience of the chemist with that of the electrician , means have been found of converting the nitrogen of the air into compounds which serve in time of peace to increase the fertility of the land , and in time of war to form the foundation of high explosives . Hence the importance of the synthetic nitrogen industry , which requires cheap electric power , derived from water , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new districts , on the coast of Norway , among the mountains of Central Europe , or on the shores of the Pacific . It is being followed by a number of other electrochemical industries , which associate themselves with it , and are assisting in that transfer of industry from the coalfields of which mention has already been made . The early scenes of the industrial revolution were set in England , where both invention and application advanced more rapidly than elsewhere . For many years other nations were content to follow at an interval the path traced out by British industry . It was only later that they became serious rivals , and the struggle for  | industrial supremacy belongs to a later period than that considered in this essay . There were several reasons for this industrial leadership of England . Her supremacy in shipping and in foreign trade had given the people an active interest in industrial production , and stable political conditions had favoured the growth of a large industrial population , including many skilled craftsmen . When the change in the manufacture of iron took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in abundance in the north , giving this country a great natural advantage at the start . It is remarkable how , as each successive development arose , suitable raw materials were found conveniently placed ? clay for steel crucibles , ganister for the Bessemer process , and so on . But these material factors are not sufficient in themselves to account for the English leadership in the industrial revolution . There was a practical bias of the English intellect that also played its part . The experimental method of investigation , although splendidly represented in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo , is most characteristic of English science , from Roger Bacon onwards . It is commonly associated with his later namesake , but the name of Francis Bacon was rather a rallying cry for the school than anything more . The strict Baconian method , as expounded in detail by its author , was barren of results , although the general principle was an inspiration , and the real founders of the experimental school were Boyle and the men who established the Royal Society . They fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , and it was their work , interpreted by Voltaire and d'Alembert , that influenced Continental science . The philosophy of Locke had a practical tendency , and whilst French speculative thought in the eighteenth century took mainly a political direction , that of England was essentially practical . That the advocates of experimental investigation looked  | deliberately to industrial applications of their discoveries may be made clear by quoting a passage from Bishop Thomas Sprat 's History of the Royal Society , published in 1667 . Sprat was one of the founders of the Society , and his essay is a powerful defence of the experimental method against criticisms from the philosophical and religious points of view . After showing how inventions have mostly arisen from one of three causes ? chance , the desire of pleasure or luxury , and necessity ? he goes on to show that the study of experimental philosophy , as he calls it , provides a more excellent way : It is impossible for us to administer this power of dominion over nature aright , unless we prefer the light of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , of the industry , and Works of those that labor . The Benefits are vast , that will appear upon this conjunction . By this means the Inventions of chance will be spread into all their various uses , and multiply 'd into many new advantages : By this the Productions of necessity , will be amplify 'd , and compleated : By this those of Luxury , and Wantoness may be reduc 'd to some solid ends : By this may be rays 'd almost as certain a Method to invent new Mechanics , as now any particular Mechanics can practise , to produce their own Operations . ... By this that will be amended , which has bin hitherto the misfortune of such Inventions , that they have commonly fallen into mens hands , who understood not their Natures , uses , or improvements : By this the conceptions of men of Knowledge , which are wont to soar too high , will be made to descend into the material World : And the flegmatick imaginations of men of Trade , which use to grovell too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that the industrial revolution was the consequence of the new movements in science and philosophy . Without the discoveries in mechanics and physics of the seventeenth century , the methods of industry could not have been transformed in the eighteenth . That the social consequences of the change were in  | large measure disastrous , and that a period of callous cruelty almost unexampled in history followed on an invention that might have brought material comfort to all , is to be attributed to the low standard of morality then prevailing , to a temporary retrograde movement in religion , and to the fact that the practical development of the physical sciences had outstripped the growth of abstract science . Biology was scarcely born , sociology had hardly been dreamed of as a science . In the great transition that is before us , from the selfish , wasteful , and ugly Palaeotechnic age to the peaceful organization of Neotechnic industry , all the sciences will have to take their part . Some of the most ardent advocates of the claims of science to be the guide of national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too narrowly , including in it only the physical aspects of the universe , perhaps adding the study of the animal and vegetable world . Viewed so narrowly , science is dangerously open to misapplication in the cause of commercial interests or of military ambitions , and it is only when its scope is so extended as to include the life of man in society that the reproach can be avoided . The conception of science as a whole , ranging from mathematics to sociology and ethics , is the true safeguard against its misuse in antisocial ways . Footnote  | THE INFLUENCE OF DARWINISM ON THOUGHT AND LIFE J. ARTHUR THOMSON ? T. Meaning of Darwinism IT is useful to take Darwinism ' in a large sense , as including six great ideas . First , there is the web of life , the inter-relations binding organisms together , the linkages which form an increasingly intricate system .

Second , there is the struggle for existence , all the answers-back that living creatures make to environing difficulties and limitations , partly in competition with fellows of the same kith and kin , partly in parrying the attacks of foes belonging to other races , and partly in reaction against the callous fates of the physical world . The struggle may mean girding the loins or tightening the belt , trimming the lamps of the senses or quickening the pace , putting on a garment of invisibility or attending the mind thereunto ' , to use Sir Isaac Newton 's phrase . Third , there is the idea of variability , the mysterious fountain of change which wells up from the germinal depths , sometimes resulting in a little more of this quality and a little less of that , sometimes leading to a remarkable shuffling of the hereditary cards so that the outcome is a distinct novelty .  | Fourth , there is the idea of sifting or winnowing , the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often subtle process , as Darwin always insisted . Fifth , there is included in Darwinism a vindication of the general idea of evolution , that the present is the child of the past and the parent of the future . This was indeed an old idea , but Darwin made it current intellectual coin . He showed that it was a formula that fitted ? a modal , rather than a causal description of what had occurred . But Darwin proceeded to change it into a causal theory by showing how the consistent Natural Selection of variations might work out new adaptations . Sixth , we must include in Darwinism the thesis that Man is solidary with the rest of creation and the outcome of a process of natural evolution . Such then are the six great ideas included in Darwinism . ? 2 . Changes in Darwinism The next question is more difficult : How has Darwinism changed since it was first promulgated ? For of course it has made progress , and it is with the Darwinian body of doctrine that we have to deal , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bad sign of an evolution theory if it did not itself evolve ! First of all , it may be said that the fact of evolution stands more firmly than ever ; the uncertainties concern the factors . Perhaps it is clearer than it used to be that it does not explain anything to say that it evolved , for that is merely stating the manner of its becoming . Perhaps it is clearer than it used to be that there is no way of proving the evolution theory as one might prove the law of gravitation ; all that can be shown is that it is a descriptive formula that fits , and that there is nothing to contradict it . Apart from a few heretics who profess to believe ? in  | defiance of the rock-record ? that the lower forms of life are derived by simplification from the higher , there is unanimity as to the derivation of our present-day fauna and flora from an antecedent fauna and flora on the whole simpler , and so on back and back . And apart from Professor Bateson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably be represented as an unpacking of an original complex , which contained within itself the whole range of diversity which living things present ' , there is general belief in an age-long progression from the simple to the complex , a general increase in differentiation and integration , and a frequent emergence of what must be called new . For a time naturalists spoke as if they knew everything about evolution ; now it is rather the fashion to speak as if we knew nothing about it . The fact is that while our ignorance remains immense , as Darwin said , we have come to know a good deal . The general idea of organic evolution commends itself to all naturalists , and it is justified of its children . But it is not so easy as it looks . This is plain whenever we pass from the fact to the factors . If the inquiry were not very young there would be reason for being disappointed over the uncertainties that surround the problems of variation , heredity , and selection ; and over our ignorance of the precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Backboned Animals or Birds . We have not even attained to clearness in regard to the origin of a species ? i.e. a discontinuous group of similar individuals , breeding true ( in the main ) inter se , but not readily fertile with other species . ? 3 . Changes in regard to Variation For the raw materials of evolution , Darwin relied chiefly on minute fluctuations , the origin of which he confessed he did not know . He was intrigued by brusque  | or saltatory variations , but he thought that they would be swamped by intercrossing . He inclined to a belief in some transmission of the direct organismal results of changes in environment , nutrition , use and disuse . In speaking of fortuitous variations he meant little more than that the particular combinations of causes that give rise to a new departure remain unknown . He had the idea that two or more different variations may be linked together or correlated , one involving the other . We know now that variations are even more abundant than Darwin supposed . The fountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not realize , that most of the variations ? some would say all ? are due to germinal permutations and combinations . We are very dubious in regard to the transmissibility of somatic modifications ( ' acquired characters ' ) as such or in any representative degree ; though it is premature to shut the Lamarckian door . We know that discontinuous variations or brusque mutations are common , and that they have great staying power in inheritance . In some cases it is certain that the germinal factors ' corresponding to these mutations and to all or many of the discrete non-blending unit characters ' of the organism lie in longitudinal order in the chromosomes of the nucleus of the germ-cell . In a few cases something is known of their topography . In the fruit-fly Drosophila there are known to be about 7,500 of these factors ' or genes ? hereditary cards which can be shuffled . One hereditary factor ' or determiner ' may affect several adult characters ( corroborating Darwin 's idea of the correlation of variations ) , and one adult character may be the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some experimental evidence that variations are sometimes definite or orthogenetic , i.e. occurring consistently in a particular direction .  | In other words , a variation may be congruent with what has already been enregistered in the organization of the creature . Just as an architect can not add a random new feature to a building , but only what is consistent with the given style , so it is unlikely that anyhow ' variations are common . The organism is a unity , even when it is an implicit organism , the germ-cell . As to the origin of the new , we know much in regard to the opportunities afforded for shuffling the hereditary cards during the life-history of the germ-cells , especially during maturation and fertilization . There are some facts which show that deeply saturating environmental , nutritional , and functional peculiarities may pull the trigger of germinal changefulness . And just as there is a periodic scrapping and reorganization ( endomixis ) in the nuclear constitution of a slipper animalcule , artificially kept in a pure-line culture in which conjugation does not occur , so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a germ-cell . What is particularly baffling is not the occurrence of a little more of this or a little more of that , but the emergence of something distinctively new . It looks as if the germcells made experiments in self-expression . 4 . Changes in regard to Heredity Darwin was one of the first to show that heredity is amenable to scientific treatment . He had a particular theory of his own ? an ingenious hypothesis of the centripetal passage of gemmules from changed parts of the body to the reproductive organs . In this way the changes hammered on to the individual body might conceivably affect the next generation . But Darwin had no clear idea of the continuity of the germ-plasm , and therefore did not understand the radical reason why like tends to beget like . That was made plain by his cousin Francis  | Galton and by Weismann . Most unluckily Darwin did not come to know the work of Mendel , which would have delighted him . Thus he was unaware of the precise vehicles of the factors for hereditary characters ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ-cells ) ; and he did not know how those from the two sides of the house are sorted out among the offspring in intelligible proportions . What we do not know is how these factors ' come to be , how they express themselves in development , and how changes may arise within them as well as in their assortment or distribution . Since Darwin 's day , the list of demonstrably heritable characters has been greatly increased , but many if not most naturalists would agree in excluding somatic modifications or acquired characters ' . The modes of inheritance tend to be reduced to Mendelian formulae , though many still believe that some pairs of characters , differing in the father and the mother organism , may blend in the offspring . Perhaps there has been since Darwin 's day an increased clearness as to what heredity is . It is no principle , fate , or force , but a relation of genetic continuity between successive generations , admitting of variations as well as ensuring the general persistence of specific organization . It includes the study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The distinction between re-impression of peculiarities and their transmission or hereditary continuance has become clear , as also the difference between the inheritance of a disease and the inheritance of a predisposition towards it . Of considerable practical importance also is the distinction between ante-natal infection and the hereditary continuance of a disease . There is value in the recognition of the fact that the expression of a character in the course of the development is always the resultant  | of two components ? the hereditary nature ' and the environmental , nutritional , and functional nurture ' . For this takes the fatalistic edge off heredity . Finally there is clearness in distinguishing between the natural inheritance ( to use Sir Francis Galton 's phrase ) enregistered in the germ-plasm , and the extra-organismal heritage embodied in traditions and permanent products , forming , indeed , part of the environment in the wide sense . 5 . Changes in regard to Sifting The essence of the Darwinian contribution to aetiology is the theory of Natural Selection ? the sifting of tentatives , the winnowing of experiments . Darwin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selection , broader and subtler than many since . Those naturalists are in line with Darwinian tradition who distinguish various modes of selection , e.g. lethal and reproductive , sexual and germinal . In a few cases , like Weldon 's crabs , the actual working of Natural Selection has been demonstrated . Similarly , to take a diagrammatic case , Cesnola tethered brown Mantises on withered herbage , and they escaped their enemies ; and green Mantises on green plants , with the same result ; whereas brown insects on a green background , or green insects on brown , were soon picked off . It is clearer than it once was among the non-expert that selection need not mean immediate elimination of the relatively less fit , for the same final result may be reached by handicapping , e.g. if the relatively less fit organisms have a shorter and harder life and a smaller , less successful family . The common misunderstanding is dying , that the survival of the fittest need mean more than the survival of the relatively fittest to a given environment . The tapeworm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , when we take a long view , there has been a general increase of differentiation and integration in the course of organic evolution . Of great importance is the fact that Natural Selection operates in relation to a system of inter-relations ? the web of life ? already established , for this explains why Shibboleths may have survival value . A nuance in the inter-relations between flower and bee may be decisive , and it is so all round . Moreover , the establishment of inter-relations gives some external security for progress . There has been an evolution of sieves as well as of the material to be sifted . Another step is the recognition of the importance of Isolation in its varied forms geographical , habitudinal , temporal , and temperamental ? for isolation tends to inbreeding or endogamy , which stabilizes a stock or species , whereas outbreeding or exogamy promotes variability , sometimes almost like an epidemic . Alternations of inbreeding and outbreeding have almost certainly meant much in evolution . It seems fair to say that , since Darwin 's time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Darwin once spoke of the beautiful hinge of some bivalve shells , from which men used to argue to the skill of the ' Divine Artificer ' , to use the rather terrible phrase of those days . But Darwin said that what had come about in the shell was more like the formation of the beautiful snow-wreaths which we see when there is a snowstorm in windy weather . But perhaps the comparison did not show Darwin 's usual shrewdness . For we can give , in proportion to our knowledge of the facts , a satisfactory mechanical description of what happens in the making of a snow-wreath , whereas we can not give any mechanical re-description of the origin of really new mutations , nor of the way in which the chick is minted  | and coined out of the egg , nor of the ingenuity with which animals play the hand of cards with which they have been endowed . It is true that the environment often selects organisms , but it is also true that organisms often select their environment , and in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living creatures are not passive pawns ; they play their own game . Organisms take a share in their own evolution . Purpose is a scientific concept when we are dealing with some known agent ; we may legitimately speak of the intelligent purpose of the dog and the instinctive purpose of the bee . But to speak of purpose in Nature or in Evolution is to go beyond science in the strict sense ; we are passing to philosophical interpretation . Yet we can not refrain from trying to see things whole ' . The old lady marvelled at the providential way in which big rivers ran past big towns ; are we repeating this naive mistake when we call attention to the abundant availability of C , H , 0 , N on or near the surface of the cooling planet , to the almost unique property of water which keeps pools from freezing solid and thus allows of freshwater faunas in North Temperate countries , to the broad foundations of small fry that make higher animals possible , to the conservatism in evolution that holds fast that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often seems as if a multitude of factors conspired towards a progressive result . We often seem to hear the order and purposiveness of an onward advancing melody . The institution of the order of Nature must have been well thought out . 6 . Manifold Influence of Darwinism The influence of Darwinism on modern thought and life is too big for more than illustration in an hour 's lecture . We should have liked to show how Darwinism  | was the leaven that made Psychology a new science ? comparative , genetic , and concrete ; but that in itself is a long story . We should like to have asked how far philosophy has been influenced by the demonstration of continuity in Nature and Man ; or how Pragmatism is in some measure a recognition of the struggle for existence in the world of ideas . But we must restrict ourselves to three illustrations ? the influence of Darwinism on Sociology , on Religion , and on everyday human life with its hopes and ideals . 7 . Influence on Sociology How has Sociology been influenced ? The foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , but as a definite science sociology is young , and all but its earliest development has been under the influence of evolutionism . It has been genetic from the start , and has not undergone a metamorphosis like biology and psychology . From the moment of its modern formulation , by Comte and Spencer , it has been influenced by the demonstration of man 's solidarity with the rest of creation , and by the idea of evolution going on here and now . But just because sociology has grown in Darwinian soil it has run certain risks , from which it has suffered . Ideas which had been suggested by human affairs to biology , returned to sociology with a biological imprimatur , and sometimes with a false simplicity . We mean such ideas as Division of Labour and the Struggle for Existence . For a time it was almost like a game to press analogies between the individual organism and the so-called social organism ' , between the Realm of Organisms and the Kingdom of Man . More serious was the utilization of biological generalizations to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the  | struggle for existence , and laissez-faire slackness was justified as congruent with the regime of Natural Selection . ' Leave things alone ; the survival of the fittest will follow ' : the silly cackle continued . Because there have been ' Lost Races ' among animals , extinctions without any residue of descendants , it was argued that every human race or nationality must reach its limit and then decline . Next day the talk would be about the inevitableness of progress , the previous day 's convictions in regard to degeneration and lost races being forgotten . It is not reactionary to indicate the grave danger of ' biologisms ' . Just as a materialism is the simplicist fallacy of forcing vital facts into mechanical frames , constructed for a different order of facts , so a biologism is the simplicist fallacy of trying to make sociology a department , of the study of mammals . Up to a certain point there is a legitimate biology of mankind , and one wishes one knew more about it . An albino child is a human mutation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary characters have for their vehicles twenty-four or so chromosomes in the human germ-cell ; the differential death-rate in mankind sometimes illustrates Natural Selection . All that is clear . Man is a mammalian organism , and illustrates biological formulae . But he is also a rational and a social organism , a ' political being ' , a member of a society in which the whole is more than the sum of the parts . What are the big differences which change the venue ? The sociological unit is a societary form ; variations are no longer confined to the germ-plasm ; great men , big ideas , and social organizations count supremely ; there is a social heritage ? or , under another aspect , we may call it the social environment , which is as supreme as the Natural Inheritance is fundamental . Moreover , the selective processes are now in great part rational , or , if  | not rational , more or less consciously realized . It is only necessary to state these differences to see how unscientific it is to try to force social affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verified in the higher field . This has obvious practical corollaries , for a proposal which is justifiable biologically ? the euthanasia of incurables , for instance ? may be quite invalid sociologically . Here also , we have to face the dilemma of civilization that the growth of social sentiment tends to favour the continuance and even the multiplication of undesirables , who would not be tolerated under Nature 's regime , where there is no place for the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin ? unless indeed in parasitism . Man 's kindness in the present is apt to mean cruelty in the future . ? 8 . Influence on Religion It appears that Man has usually become religious at limits of his practical , emotional , and intellectual tethers . Now Darwinism with its corollary the Control of Life means more power , and therefore , in proportion , less need for , let us say , offering gifts to propitiate the gods . On the other hand , it is only to the shallow-witted that the world has become through Darwinism less wonderful , less beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as open as before ? perhaps more clearly open . When the half-gods go , the God arrives . The Darwinian world is grander than Paley 's . And as to the limit of the intellectual tether , we get there soon enough even with all the light of Darwinism to illumine our thinking . For biology tells us little of more than chronological beginnings , e.g. that birds emerged from a reptilian stock in the Jurassic age ; it tells us nothing of essences and very little of more than the modes of becoming . What science is always saying  | is : If this , then that ' ; or this occurrence is a particular case of laws VII and IX . But the concepts of these laws or descriptive formulae are big with mystery ? organism , protoplasm , development , and the like . We venture to say that Darwinism leaves plenty of room for religion from the intellectual side . Of course we must not be taken as suggesting that religion is a sort of crutch for our weakness or a pillow for our weariness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of an enrichment , like music , if we are strong enough and open-souled enough to use it . This change , however , has come about ? a change in our understanding of the aim of science . Its aim is to describe and formulate , whereas the task of religion is to interpret transcendentally . Science is ever reducing the fractions of reality that we know to their lowest common denominator ; religion seeks for the greatest common measure ? the Will of the Absolute . In general , no conflict should be possible between religion and science , unless we try to speak two languages at once . This is no return to idea-tight compartments , science in one and religion in another ; it is simply a recognition of the fact that scientific ( empirically descriptive ) concepts and religious ( transcendentally interpretative ) concepts are incommensurable . The title of a book , God oy Natural Selection , is a diagram of the pernicious fallacy we are condemning . Science must never dance to the piping of religion or theology , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Are you sure that your Darwinian concept of the struggle for existence is accurate and adequate ? ' And there are many similar questions possible . In the uplands of mysticism , science has no right of way . The only conflict between science and religion is when particular forms of religious ideas are in detail at variance  | with scientific descriptions . Thus a literal , one may say wooden , acceptance of the Genesis poem regarding Man 's origin contradicts scientific description , but that is not to say that there is no contribution to Truth in the religious poetical interpretation . Similarly , as exoterically expounded , the theological doctrine of the Fall is unacceptable scientifically , for it is an ascent , not a descent , that we have behind us . It is not very difficult to see that a Doctrine of Creation may be rehabilitated as a religious interpretation of the Institution of the Order of Nature ; and when Dame Nature in Charles Kingsley 's Water Babies said to the child who expected to find her very busy , You see , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teleology deeper than the old doctrine of design and not inconsistent with Darwinism . On the other hand , the doctrine of the resurrection of the body in its usual literal form seems an insult to the scientific intelligence . If it be said that religious feeling and interpretation are generically independent of particular forms , then the remarks we have made will refer to the influence of Darwinism on theology rather than on religion . We have spoken , on the other side , of the right that the religious thinker has to inquire into the adequacy of a scientific statement when that passes beyond the field of exact knowledge . That inquiry may be made , for instance , in regard to the biological account of Man 's place in Nature . The demonstration of Man 's affiliation to the highest order of mammals was certainly a great gain . It gave a new unity and continuity to the whole world-process ; it gave a new significance to the long groaning and travailing ol creation . But there is often a tax to pay on a big intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional unworthiness in our thoughts of Man as one whose grandfather was a monkey ' .  | No doubt there is an all-pervading similitude of structure between man and the highest apes , bone for bone , muscle for muscle , convolution for convolution ; man is a walking museum of relics , some of which go back to a remote aquatic ancestry ; in his individual development he climbs up his own genealogical tree ; in his relapses he betrays his ancestry . Now it is no doubt profitable at times to look on the rock whence we were hewn and the pit whence we were digged , but there are other profitable directions in which we may look . What a piece of work is a man ! how noble in reason ! how infinite in faculty ! in form and moving how express and admirable ! in action how like an angel ! in apprehension how like a god ! ' Part of the truth lies here . The apartness of Man remains , whatever be his pedigree . Shakespeare is not less great because once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scion of a stock common to him and the Gorilla . His apartness is in his big brain , his language , his conceptual reason , his morality , his ability to envisage and control his own evolution . Think for a moment of what the objective facts suggest . There is a solemnity in the patience of the age-long man-ward adventure which has crowned the evolutionary process upon the earth . Two or three millions of years ago the Primate stem sent out its first tentative branches , and the result was a tangle of monkeys . First the New World monkeys diverged , and then those of the Old World ; the main stem grew on . It gave off the lower Anthropoid Apes , and then the higher , but the main stem , vaguely known , probed on . Without haste , without rest , and sometimes leading to nothing , more branches were given off ? tentative men , eventually : Pithecanthropus the erect , the slouching Neanderthalers , the man of Heidelberg and of the Sussex Weald . In none of these , they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The Neanderthalers had their day and ceased to be ? the main stem split into African , Australian , Mongolian , Indo-Aryan and European races . The story is so remarkable that we feel the vulgarity of saying that Man sprang from a monkey . We question rather whether there is not a purpose at the core of the world-process . This , at least , we would plead for ? trying to see the process as a whole . When we are dealing with the significance of any process , we may get glimpses when we consider a particular transition . From reptiles sprang birds ? there is significance in that . It meant a movement to greater integration , more emancipation of mind , more freedom of body , a richer life , and more satisfaction in life . But think of the entire evolution in the light of its outcome ? which includes Man . And there is no reason to believe that achievements are all in the past ! ? 9 . Influence on Life Our last question concerns the influence of Darwinism on ordinary human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of illustrations . The first concerns the Control of Life ' , which is to Darwinism as works to faith . When it became clear that out of the crab-tree by the wayside , more promising in its flowers than in its fruit , man had evolved all the aristocrats of the orchard , the question was bound to arise whether man might not evolve some of the crabbedness out of himself . When it became clear that out of a wolf man had evolved the domestic dog , the trusty guardian of his herds , the question was bound to arise whether man might not evolve some of the wolfish out of himself . Pasteur might perhaps be taken as the figurehead of the modern idea of the scientific control of life , though Francis Bacon was quite clear that the aim of science was not only the glory of the Creator ' but the relief of  | Man 's estate ' . When one thinks of the triumphs of modern medicine and sanitation , when one gathers together the practicable suggestions of Eugenics , Eutechnics , and Eutopias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one sees no limit to what Man may do in taking fuller possession of his kingdom . It is certain that a closer linkage of science and goodwill may remove shackles and handicaps that hinder Man gratuitously , and may thus leave him more free for higher adventures . The second illustration is more subtle , yet surely not far-fetched . Every one remembers Huxley 's picture of Animate Nature as a vast gladiatorial show , a dismal cockpit , a Hobbesian warfare ? each for himself , and extinction take the hindmost . Man , Huxley argued , must , in his ethical endeavours , turn his face in the opposite direction ? solus contra mundum . But while Huxley painted one aspect of Nature in his lurid picture , there is another which is at least equally true . There are modes of the Struggle for Existence in which the solution is found in an increase of parental care , in experiments in mutual aid and sociality . Goethe wisely said that Nature was always taking advantage of her children 's capacity for self-forgetfulness . But may we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implying a judgement of values . It means the fuller embodiment of the True , the Beautiful , and the Good in lives which are increasingly a satisfaction in themselves. ; and the pre-conditions of this progress are Health and Wealth , meaning by Health not merely the absence of disease , but positive vigour , and meaning by Wealth a happy mastery of the requisite energies . Now the main movement of evolution has been integrative and progressive . It has meant the emergence of nobler , finer , more moralized types . It actually discloses movements which are the counterparts of man 's  | endeavours after the True , the Beautiful , and the Good . Nature is all for health and all for beauty . She rewards the creatures that face the facts , which is the beginning of the search for truth . She gives the premier place to those that have learned the lesson of self-subordination . The momentum of evolution is behind us when we are at our best . Footnote  | SCIENCE AND EDUCATION A. E. HEATH OUR common task , in this course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . Such a line of work falls naturally into place as part of a wider movement towards a fuller appreciation of the basis of science upon which modern social structures are built . This movement has two main streams . On the one hand a growing band of scientific workers have turned their attention to the building up of a real history of science ; and of a first-hand account of scientific procedure . What is aimed at is not a history of trivial biographical detail , but a real treatment of the evolution of scientific ideas ; not a philosophy of science which consists in the spinning of a fine web of a priori constructions out of the philosopher 's superior wisdom , but a critical attempt to obtain a general synthetic view of scientific concepts , methods , and principles from a careful survey of their actual use in the hands of scientific workers themselves . These studies must inevitably have important bearings upon any serious attempt to estimate the influence of science on the thought and on the material organization of the world we live in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow interpretation of science as a body of fact , and will turn our attention to science as what Professor Nunn has called a. grand expression of the human spirit ' . On the other hand we have a closely associated move-  | ment among those modern historians who are dissatisfied with the older over-stressing of the political aspects of history . Once we accept the view that history is the account in full of man 's achievement , of his increase in knowledge as well as in the power which comes from knowledge , then the character , growth , and influence of science form an important part of that study . In broad outline we may anticipate our conclusions and say that the two parts of this movement exhibit science as an age-long process which has enabled man to trace ever more complete uniformities and correlations in his world , and has given him in consequence new powers of control . From the first of these comes a deepening sense of social unity ; from the second , an intensification of social responsibility . It is a fatal mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : nevertheless he does seem to be groping towards ever more consciously directed control over the social institutions ( including education ) whose growth has been , however dimly and inadequately , an expression of his social unity . Now it is clear that if , with these considerations in mind , we ask what has been the influence of science on that part of social . organization we call education we are entering upon a vast field whose full treatment may well employ generations of workers . We can only , in our brief survey , choose a single aspect of this subject ; and even within the limits set , only attempt a preliminary and tentative treatment . If we confine ourselves to English education , it still leaves our subject too wide : English education is a growth whose continuity is being more and more emphasized in recent work . Nevertheless we can justify the further limiting of our subject to the modern period . For , as Professor Archer has well said , Institutions are not like plants which grow from a seed into a predetermined shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creative period , and such a creative period was the nineteenth century . ' Again , in treating our narrower subject we must guard against any implication that the creative force with which we are here concerned ? the intellectual movement centred in the sciences ? was the only moulding force acting in this period . The ferment in the public schools during the middle of the nineteenth century and the enlargement of classical studies called classical humanism ' are examples of other important forces whose effects are clearly discernible in the educational theory and practice of our own time . We must however recognize that any adequate treatment of the influence of science on modern education must embody the important fact that it has been more than the impact of an intellectual movement . In addition to its primary influence on education , science has itself affected social organization in general and produced secondary influences arising out of the changes so induced . In revolutionizing the methods of production in modern times it has , for instance , affected the functions of the State , precipitated social movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , react on educational theory and practice . We may express this by saying that our age is one ( a ) whose material characteristics are closely connected with scientific progress and ( b ) whose thought is saturated with scientific ideas . In view of this double character it will be convenient to make a twofold division in our treatment of the influence of science upon modern education , and to distinguish between ( 1 ) the influence of scientific results , and ( 2 ) the influence of the method and outlook of science . Footnote  | The most important general influence of scientific results has been referred to above , namely the revolution brought about in the methods of industry . Modern students of the industrial revolution draw a distinction between the earlier change from individual to organized production and the later changes resulting from the application of the results of the physical sciences to industrial processes . This distinction is important because it emphasizes the continuity of the movement . The change in the last decade of the eighteenth and early decades of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place before . The social consequences are not , that is to say , to be sought entirely in science ; and the more evil of these consequences seem to come , not from improved powers of production alone ( it seems incredible that they should , though many people write as if they believed it ) but from the rapidity of the changes in view of- the special character of the time . This point we must stress because it has an important bearing not only upon our view of the direct influence of this social upheaval upon education , but also , as we shall see later , upon our view of the influence on education of the method and outlook of science . Professor G. W. Daniels has stated the case with great clarity in his Early English Cotton Industry . ' The idea that a movement characterized by a greater power of production and by an expanding economic unity could , of itself , be a cause of widespread distress and of social retrogression is , he says , a hard one to accept . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic changes were probably concentrated within this country to an extent they would Footnote  | not have been in time of peace ; and he shows that contemporary movements which were making for social development were checked by war-time class-legislation . The Napoleonic war , he concludes , thus becomes the dominant factor in the social and economic history of this period . Owing to its occurrence the whole movement was distorted , the increasing power of production was diverted from improving the material welfare of the community , and problems of industrial relationships which might have been faced at once were left as a heritage to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . In the light of these conclusions we can see that the influences on education of the applications of science to material production are twofold . ( a ) In the first place the increased control of man 's material environment , whether misused or not , carried with it important consequences . A complex industrial machine can not be reared on a foundation of unskilled work . The need for elementary and technical education , which became urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reconstruction of the whole system of national education upon a new basis . ' ' Moreover , the intrusion of organized scientific results into everyday life compelled the admission of scientific subjects into every grade of school and into university studies . An elaborate account of the fight of science for a place in the curriculum would tell us less than the bare fact that artisans studied science before Cambridge undergraduates knew of it ' . 2 To these consequences we may add the slow secularization of educational control . ( b ) In the second place , the evil consequences of the 1 Sir Michael Sadler , Lecture Courses in the Department of Education , University of Manchester , ' History of Education in England 1800-1910 , ' xvi . - Footnote  | industrial revolution precipitated social movements which in turn affected education . We need only recall the influence , both direct and indirect , on educational thought of Ruskin , Maurice , and Kingsley . It is precisely here , however , that a just estimate of the place of science in the chain of causes becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialism had other origins than mere increase in productiveness . Unfortunately this was not always recognized ; movements against preventable evils were occasionally directed also against the whole idea of scientific production and even against science itself . Our own age is not entirely proof against this confusion of causes : and from it , I feel convinced , comes a great part of the current belief that science is a piece of soulless intellectual machinery tending to the standardization of men and things , and to the ultimate destruction of finer shades and values . It is true that increased productiveness has left man with the immense and as yet unsolved problem of its effective control ; but the gospel of despair preached by those critics who observe only the lack of such control , and lay them at the door of science , brings to the ordinary man neither conviction nor encouragement . The view here taken is that it is only by the application of the method of science to the problems of control in turn that any hope for the future of mankind lies . In education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of reasons ? the first developments of national primary education were stiff , standardized , and in a literal sense lacking in values . But here again it must be observed that scientific results have greatly helped , as the century advanced , in the growth of a more rational and humane outlook ; whilst the mode of co-operative investigation in the sciences probably influenced the official labours on the administrative defects of the earlier systems . The extension of  | scientific method to the field of biology , which is the outstanding characteristic of the later nineteenth century , emphasized the organic unity of the life of the community , and so gave a new significance to the responsibility of providing for all the conditions necessary to healthy mental and physical growth . But it did more than merely help the drift towards a national system of education : it provided solid ground for a reasoned firsthand study of the sensitive growing creatures who were to be subject to that system . The biological outlook , with its concept of development , does not leave men content with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of children in the middle of the nineteenth century . The extension of scientific method to the domain of mind has in turn added its important part to the tale of the influence of scientific results on educational theory and practice . But as we approach the twentieth century it becomes less and less possible to differentiate between influences of results and influences of method , because man 's whole attitude has been so profoundly modified by the latter . Before attempting , however , to deal with the influences of method , it is necessary to state as plainly as possible that the method and outlook of science have meant different things at different times and to different people . Moreover , as has been hinted above , what men have taken them to mean , as well as what they really were , affected thought and practice . Hence some inquiry , however inadequate , into the meaning of science regarded as an age-long growth is a necessary preliminary to a treatment of the influence of scientific method ' on education . All that can be attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an inquiry might be pursued , in the hope that the digression may justify itself by the light it throws on our main theme .  | The first question which arises is whether any intelligible meaning at all can be assigned to scientific method ' in view of the fact that there are so many different sciences . If method ' be conceived as the result of abstracting many methods ' , and comprising a kind of generalized research tool whose use can be learnt before it is applied to any field , then the answer is emphatically No . But scientific method ' may be regarded as something rather different from this : as a characteristic mode of approach to the study of any field of human experience . In each actual field , on this view , workers will employ methods ' common to other fields , but to which its users will give slight shades of emphasis or meaning that impart to them a form typical of that special field . Moreover the balance of methods ' used will vary from field to field . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative importance in the whole , will depend entirely on the domain chosen . In the domain of light , for instance , deduction plays a much greater part than in anatomy : yet I believe that a very real meaning attaches to saying that both physicist and anatomist employ a common mode of approach to their respective domains . This was what Huxley meant by claiming that different habits of mind and various special tendencies of two sciences do not imply a difference in method . The mountaineer and the man of the plains have very different habits of progression , and each would be at a loss in the other 's place ; but the method of progression , by putting one leg before the other , is the same in each case . ' 1 There is a curious relevance in this metaphor to the view which will here be expressed as to what this Footnote  | common mode of approach to different subjects is : for I take it to consist essentially of two processes whose alternations are comparable to the placing of first one and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I ) the observing and testing of a body of facts , and ( 2 ) the ordering ' or systematizing of those facts , by the discovery or creation of appropriate conceptions and hypotheses , into general and easily grasped truths . ' Knowledge of a chaotic body of facts does not constitute a science . To step ( I ) has to be added step ( 2 ) That is to say , the body of fact has to be , in Professor Nunn 's phrase , rendered intelligible ' .2 Moreover this double process is never finished , for the ordering of any field always directs attention back to a closer examination of the body of fact . Theories constructed to co-ordinate facts lead to the discovery of additional groups of fact ; these , in turn , are susceptible of further ordering , and so on in an endless series.3 It should be carefully noted that both steps are essential . In certain periods the need for constant critical and first-hand observation was overlooked , and science degenerated into system-building ; in other ages there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sole requirement in scientific work , a denial of man 's most valuable possession ? the power of imaginative reason . Footnote  | For healthy scientific development a proper balance between the two factors must be maintained . It is important that we should recognize that scientific . method , viewed in this way as a mode of approach to the study of any subject , has , through many vicissitudes , been first attained in its complete form by man in the domains of mathematics and of external nature . It is this which has led to the everyday use of scientific method ' to designate that mode of treatment of a field which is seen in its most unquestionable form in the domain of the natural sciences . In common speech something quite definite is meant by saying that a man is tackling a subject in a scientific manner ; and what is referred to is not the methods used so much as the manner of wielding those methods . This is the justification for our usage ; though it must be admitted that the word method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion , because it tends to confusion with methods ' . The utility of this usage for our present purpose is that it enables us to envisage science throughout the ages as a single development . Thus in broad outline we may say that in Greek science at its best this balance was won . Its first victory was in the domain of spatial experience ; and the importance for thought , in all fields , of the step from the empirical results of Egyptian mathematicians to the general theorems of Greek geometers can not be over-estimated . Greek geometry , the first fruits of the method , not only developed the logical machinery necessary for the scientific mode of approach to the world of external nature , but also fostered the objectivity of outlook essential to that approach . Especially in those domains of nature where deductive processes play the most important part , the emergence of a balanced scientific ' treatment became possible . This balance was lost again in succeeding ages , in which ? for complex reasons ?  | there is a failure to value step ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as coming under this description . It should be noticed , however , that such work often serves a real function in co-ordinating known facts and views . Thus Dr. Singer , in his account of The Scientific Views and Visions of Saint Hildegard ( 1098 ? 1180 ) ' , speaks of the use of the supposed relations between the macrocosm and the microcosm as a co-ordinating conception in which her theological and physiological knowledge , together with her notions of the working of the human mind and of the structure of the universe , are all synthesized . ' In studying it ' , he writes , the modern reader is necessarily hampered by the bizarre and visionary form into which the whole subject is cast . Nevertheless the scheme , though complex and difficult , is neither incoherent nor insane . . . this theory of the essential similarity of the macrocosm and microcosm held in the Middle Ages , during the Renaissance , and even into quite modern times , a position comparable to that of the theory of evolution in our own age . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be remembered that it also fulfilled a high purpose . It gave a meaning to the facts of nature . ' 1 Nevertheless the lack of stress in mediaeval science on the first factor carried with it loss in objectivity . It therefore represents a falling away from the direct , detached , objective temper ' which has been spoken of as the generative principle of the whole Greek achievement for civilization.2 In short , it was a regression to a more primitive form of treatment , and only a little way separates it from an earlier form still ? animistic magic . Magic , like mediaeval science , is too personal ; men read themselves , their feelings , and their desires into their explanations of the world . Animistic Footnote  | interpretations , however , like anthropomorphic ones , still perform a true co-ordinating function.l But there is this important further character of magic : it is developed in a much less conscious and less deliberate way . The origin of sympathetic magic , for instance , does not appear to be intellectual illusion . The first element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the savage wants rain he acts ' rain by croaking as he has heard frogs croak when it rains . These acts stiffen into ritual , on this view ; and beliefs in the efficacy of similarities follow later . Magical beliefs and practices are not mere unorganized collections of baseless superstitions , then , any more than mediaeval science is altogether incoherent and insane . Both are primitive forms of approach to the study of the world of nature . We can now return to our claim that this view of scientific method enables us more clearly to envisage the sciences as age-long growths . So long as they were the product of unreflective acts they could only take the stiff and self-centred form of magical beliefs , corresponding to the social organization which Bagehot called the cake of custom ' of primitive societies . In some marvellous way we find , in ancient Greece , that the complete break-up of the cake of custom has been suddenly effected . Not only is man 's outlook on the world now fully deliberate and conscious , but also it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times was not , however , a complete regression to magic : for though mediaeval astrology was primarily concerned with human hopes and fears , and only secondarily with the stars , yet its vision did reach to the stars . Nevertheless lack of appreciation of step ( I ) made even the newly gained knowledge of Greek scientific results sterile for centuries . The rediscovery of what Roger Bacon called scientia Footnote  | experimentalis was needed to revive the objective temper essential to real scientific method . The growth of this can be traced through transitional figures like Kepler to its full fruition in Galileo . The seventeenth century saw the double process of direct observation and ordering into systematic wholes applied to the complete field concerned with the study of the rest and motion of material bodies : it was the age of mechanics . Succeeding centuries saw the extension of this double process into ever wider fields of human endeavour : to various physical forces in nature , and to the field of chemical fact , in the eighteenth century ; to the domain of biology in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realms of mind and the products of mind , including social institutions . It must not be supposed , however , that this extension of scientific method to different fields means that scientific development has been a steady , uniform process in the last three centuries . Actually each age seems to have its own peculiar scientific flavour ' .1 Thus there is a certain disconnectedness in the science of the sixteenth century : it was more like the spasmodic inventiveness which still connotes science ' in many minds . Whereas the seventeenth century saw the beginnings of an interconnected character ; results in one field were used in another ? as when Galileo , hearing of the invention of the telescope , constructed one , but turned it at once to astronomical use . Co-operation between workers in different fields became common ; and most of the great European scientific academies were founded in this century . This characteristic was an essential element in future progress , for without it the ground could not have Footnote  | been cleared of the age-long accumulation of systems which cumbered it . Individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour of testing such systems by patient reference back to the field of fact upon which they claimed to be reared . This probably had some part in the failure of the first attempt in England , in the middle of the seventeenth century , to introduce science into the school curriculum . The balance had already been re-won : the mode of approach to these studies had regained its objective character . But if educational reformers like Comenius , claiming to be followers of Francis Bacon , had succeeded , the teaching of science would almost certainly have degenerated under the stifling influence of the accumulated systems to whose sifting the co-operative labours of scientific workers in this and succeeding ages had to be devoted . Moreover the Baconian account of method was little more than an early attempt at that abstraction of methods ' into a generalized research tool whose possibility we have been forced to deprecate . It has been previously suggested that the treatment of the second main division of our subject ? the influence upon education of the method and outlook of science ? ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakenly supposed that method and outlook to be . Two of these errors have enough historical importance for special mention . The first consists in the belief that the criterion of a scientific treatment is its quantitative character . If this be so , then most biological science ' is not science at all : and the greater part of all existing attempts at scientific treatment of the field of experience concerned with human ' facts , whether mental or physical , is  | worthless . It will be recognized , I think , that assumptions of this kind , often not explicitly formulated , underlie a certain type of educational theory . If our previous discussion of what is actually involved in the scientific treatment of a field is correct , then this view is false . Quantitative treatment is , of course , important in all sciences ; but it is not essential . There can be quite systematic sciences which are almost entirely qualitative ; there are , indeed , qualitative sciences which are not only systematic but also formally deductive ? as for instance non-metrical geometry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the scientific method of approach was first achieved , as we have seen , in mathematics . The second is the commonly accepted view- that the scientific treatment of a field implies that the facts of that field are ultimately reducible to mechanics ; and that , in consequence , the outlook of science tends in a last analysis to materialism . The mistake here comes from non-recognition of the self-determining character of the separate sciences . It is true that there are complex inter-relationships between all studies , and that crossfertilization is often effected by applying the concepts of one field to another . Further , it is a natural consequence of the fact that the physical sciences already possess mature and generalized descriptive schemes that biologists should seek aid from them in developing their own . And this makes it clear why they will continue to find reference to the physical sciences a fruitful methodological principle , however solemnly philosophers wag their heads at it . Yet it is a far cry from this to assert the reducibility of all the categories of one domain to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an autonomous study ; and only he who is actually at work in a particular field can determine the effective form of the concepts he
