( To be spoken before the curtain by a character representing a strolling minstrel . ) Oyez ! Oyez ! Draw close , and listen ! Nay , crowd not ! I 'll raise my voice that all may hear me . My song shall be of brave old days in Merry England , when all the world was young . Of bold Robin Hood , who , with full three-score of sturdy outlaws , did hunt the king 's brown deer , throughout the glades and glens of Sherwood Forest . Of that vile Sheriff of Nottingham , and his kinsman , Guy of Gisbourne , still more vile ! Then , whiles , I 'll sing of a good Sir Richard of the Lea , a worthy gentleman , and of his daughter , the Lady Marian , known since in song and story as Maid Marian of Sherwood . Once in my song I 'll strike a note for one who towereth over all , as forest oak o'er garden shrub  --  that peerless knight and mighty warrior , King Richard of the Lion 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saracens , is safe returned from Palestine . And so my song shall run along like little woodland brook in pleasant places , all sparkling in the springtime . Yet times ' twill pause a bit , in deeper , darker sports . Nay ! Fear not , nor hide thine eyes  --  for in the end , quite like the little brook , my song leaps out again and , dancing madly o'er the shallows , shall leave thee  --  with a laugh. @x SCENE : A glade in Sherwood Forest . Necessary to the action is a large tree , or set clump of bushes at center . AT RISE : A hunting-horn is heard in the far distance . In a moment MARIAN and DOROTHY enter from right . They are running and quite out of breath , and evidently deeply distressed and alarmed . NOTE .  --  Several of the small parts may be blended or doubled . MARIAN ( Earnestly , after she gets left ) Nay , but , Dorothy  --  thou must ! DOROTHY I am spent ! ( She falls to her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIAN ( At right third entrance , looking in alarm over her shoulder ) They come ! Dorothy ! They come ! DOROTHY I care not who comes , sweet mistress  --  I can not go ! MARIAN You will be whipped . DOROTHY ( Wearily , satisfied ) I know . MARIAN And shut up in a dark dungeon ! DOROTHY ( Hopelessly , surrender ) I know ! p. 4 MARIAN With the rats ! DOROTHY ( Springs to her feet with a scream ) Oh ! ( Running L. ) You waste time , my lady . You are too slow . ( DOROTHY exits left first entrance . MARIAN is following , when , with a cry of triumph , a party of soldiers enter from right . They are led by GUY OF GISBOURNE , a gentleman , and HUGH , an officer of the Sheriff of Nottingham 's household . ) GUY ( As MARIAN exits ) Yonder ! down the glade ! ( He points left . ) HUGH I see the jade ! SOLDIER Aye ! HUGH Come ! ( As they follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance , quite out of breath . ) SHERIFF ( Puffing for breath ) Why dost thou leave me ! How darest thou treat me so ! GUY ( Stops ) She is there ! ( Points L. ) The Lady Marian ! SHERIFF And I am here ! The Sheriff of Notingham  --  ( Leans against R. side of tree . ) Support me , Guy ! ( Staggers into GUY 's arms . GUY catches him , them lets him go . SHERIFF nearly falls , catches himself. ) p. 5 GUY ( Angrily ) Am I to let her go ! SHERIFF In good sooth she has gone  --  ( peering off L. )  --  gone far  --  too far for our safety . In this part of Sherwood Forest dwells that most villainous knave that men call Robin Hood ! Boogy man ! ( Shivers , looks around R. ) GUY ( In disgust ) Uncle ! Surely , thou dost not fear him ! SHERIFF ( Turns L. ) I like not the word . ( Hesitates ; business , bravado . ) I fear no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of a lion  --  but  --  er  --  but  --  ( Straightens up and slaps his chest . ) ( Suddenly from out L. there is a loud " Hello . " The SHERIFF drops to his knees , getting behind GUY OF GISBOURNE , clinging to his legs in terror . ) SHERIFF By Our Lady ! We are as good dead ! GUY ( Laughs ) In sooth , we 're better ! That is thy own man 's voice ! SHERIFF I like it not ! It hath an evil sound ! ( Peering L. at HUGH off L. ) p. 6 GUY Uncle ! Get up ! ( He seeks to draw the trembling man to his feet . ) Wouldst have people call thee coward ! ( The SHERIFF gets up awkwardly , looks around R. , " under and over . " " Folks are gone . " ) SHERIFF Nay ! in my castles I am a brave man . I like not these woods , they smack of wildness ! GUY The maid shall not escape me ! If she joins her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are set at naught  --  I lose a wife I could well love , and you the money you adore . SHERIFF ( Facing up R. , turns back L. , to GUY ) I pray you not to talk of sacred things like money , in such a place as this ! ( HUGH enters at L. He has LADY MARIAN by the arm and drags her roughly forward . GUY sees them . ) GUY Ah ! he has her ! Good Hugh ! ( HUGH swings her around R. of him . ) MARIAN ( Indignantly ) What means this outrage ! ( L. to HUGH . ) Am I to be dragged along by this boor as though I were a serving wench ? SHERIFF Ah ! ( Draws himself up with dignity . Crosses L. of GUY . ) Didst thou plan to escape from me  --  the High Sheriff of Nottingham ! It grieves me sorely that this churl of mine hath taken thee  --  in place of me  --  myself ! ( Very brave. ) p. 7 MARIAN ( Turns fiercely on him R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched thine eyes out ! ( HUGH grabs MARIAN 'S left arm . ) SHERIFF ( Retreats behind GUY ) Hold her firmly , good Hugh ! I like not the flash of her eyes ! and mine own I prefer as God hath placed them ! ( SHERIFF R. of GUY , crouches , looks up . ) MARIAN I go to my father , Sir Richard of the Lea ! By what right dost thou stay me ! ( Wrests her left arm free from HUGH . ) SHERIFF Thy good father left thee in my care as hostage  --  MARIAN He knew nothing of thy plan to force me into marriage with that vile man ! ( Her right hand points to GUY . MARIAN turns indignantly on GUY OF GISBOURNE . ) Six months hadst thou promised him to raise twenty thousand pounds he borrowed  --  in that time I was to be safe in my aunt 's charge . Yet , no sooner hath he started on his journey than thou doth conspire with her to force me to a sudden marriage . I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn him of thy treachery . GUY Your agreement , Lady Marian ! If , within six months , your good father returneth not the twenty thousand pounds he borrowed , his lands and castle are forfeit to mine uncle , and thou wilt become my wife ! p. 8 MARIAN I deny it not ! So was the bargain ! I myself proposed it . For my father 's sake , and for good King Richard  --  to whom the money was lent . But six months , not six hours ! And before my father has fairly left , you try to force the marriage and when I refuse you try to hold me prisoner ! ( She goes up L. of tree and down , arms folded . ) SHERIFF Peace ! ( Crosses L. ) It supports not my dignity to hear a woman 's empty scolding . Call you our men together , Hugh , and we will hie us back to my good Castle of Nottingham . MARIAN And I ? SHERIFF Go with me . ( MARIAN starts a step up L. 3 E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I  --  ( As she starts to speak . ) SHERIFF Thine aunt , the Lady Jane , awaits thee there ! MARIAN With you I 'll go  --  since I needs must , but not with Guy of Gisbourne  --  nor will I suffer him to speak again of this most hateful marriage till the six months are fully spent . GUY ( Bows gallantly ) You have my word . p. 9 MARIAN ( Coldly ) I do not value it . ( Arms folded front . ) SHERIFF ( Proudly ) Take mine , then ! ( Chest swells . ) MARIAN Nothing doubled , remains a zero . SHERIFF ( Steps away ; R. to GUY ) Thou art welcome to thy future bride , good nephew ! To me , she , like an unripe gooseberry , doth set mine teeth on edge ! Marry ! Ere I 'd marry her , I 'd wed the devil 's dam ! ( Starts up R. of tree a bit . ) MARIAN Much as I hate thee , I 'd prize to be thy wife for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( SHERIFF up R. a bit turning L. , turns back L. ) SHERIFF God make it February  --  which is the shortest ! ( A step R. , waves hand . ) Nephew , thou art a brave man  --  is sooth , thy courage will be needed . ( Continues off R.I.E. , turning R. a bit . ) Come , lady  --  MARIAN ( Firmly ) Not with him , as I have said ! ( Faces L. a bit ; she looks toward GUY OF GISBOURNE. ) p. 10 GUY As it pleaseth thee . Return with her to thy Castle of Nottingham , Uncle  --  take Hugh here as escort , the others I will keep . SHERIFF For what ? GUY To find this Robin Hood thou tellest me of . MARIAN ( Facing L. Looks R. ) Robin Hood ! What seek you of Robin Hood ? GUY His life ! ( MARIAN is about to speak , she raises head . ) Nay ! seek not to stay me . I am resolved . I shall discover him ! MARIAN With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of tree . ) GUY ( Much gratified ) I thank you , lady ! ( He bows low . ) MARIAN ( Working R. ) Nay ! you owe me nothing  --  I but said I hoped you 'd find him  --  for finding and killing bold Robin Hood are birds of different plumage . ( Stepping bravely up to him , R. a bit . ) I like not your looks , Guy of Gisbourne , and if you find Robin Hood , I doubt not he 'll alter them ! Thou art too tall for my poor taste , mayhap  --  when Robin sees that he 'll alter thee  --  by a head ! p. 11 SHERIFF ( Around tree , impressed by her fury ) Nephew ! be warned in time ! Do n't marry her ! GUY ( Laughs ) The wench hath spirit  --  like a blooded mare , she 'll be docile when she 's tamed ! ( Nods head . ) I leave her to your care , good uncle . ( He bows . ) I 'll find thy men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHERIFF looks after him lovingly . ) SHERIFF Observe  --  a brave youth  --  like all of my blood ! ( Coming from behind tree . ) My family breed bold men ! MARIAN ( Looks at him ) It may be so  --  there 're curs in every pack . SHERIFF ( Angrily ) Now , by my faith  --  I 'll  --  ( Starts R. to her . ) MARIAN ( Turns fiercely on him L. ) Do n't raise thy voice at me , sir ! SHERIFF ( Blusters ) I 'll  --  MARIAN And you do , I 'll call  --  and call aloud  --  for Robin Hood . ( She laughs. ) p. 12 SHERIFF ( In terror ) Now God have mercy ! Seize her , Hugh ! ( Around L. of HUGH . HUGH seizes MARIAN . ) Hold her firmly  --  but gently  --  My Lady ! good  --  kind  --  gentle  --  lady ! ( Aside , front . ) Saint Boswell , forgive me ! ( Aloud . ) Be pleased to follow  --  be pleased to be calm  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not hear her , could he , Hugh ? ( This very anxiously . ) HUGH Nay , sir ! SHERIFF ( Pleased ) Pooh ! and if he came I 'd make crows ' meat of him ! ( Straightens up and draws his sword . ) What care I for  --  ( A voice is heard singing out L.3 E. ) Eh ? What 's that ? MARIAN Mayhap ' t is Robin Hood ! SHERIFF ( Afraid ) God 's mercy ! think you so ! ( He drops his sword , retreating behind tree . From out L. the loud and drunken voice of FRIAR TUCK is heard , singing . ) " FRIAR TUCK ( Off L. ) Of all the brave soldiers that ever were seen , Invited to fight for a king or a queen  --  For a king or a queen invited to fight , Sure never a soldier was like this brave knight . p. 13 SHERIFF ( Trembles ) He hath a rude and warlike voice ! FRIAR TUCK ( Nearer ) He dreamt , fame reports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they landed in flat-bottomed boats ! If , in his dreams , such awful destruction he makes What havoc  --  ye gods  --  will he make , if he wakes ! ( FRIAR TUCK , a large , fat , good-natured friar , enters from L. He staggers along , obviously rather intoxicated . In one hand he twirls an enormous quarter staff  --  at L. he stops and , leaning on the staff , blinks at MARIAN , who is held by HUGH . ) FRIAR TUCK How now ! Thou saucy varlet ! Why dost thou hold the lady by the arm so rudely ? SHERIFF ( Around L. of tree ) Was all that warlike singing I heard made by thee alone , fellow ? FRIAR TUCK Fellow ? ( Comes too . ) By Saint Godrick and Our Lady of the Fountain , fellow me no fellows , sir ! And you respect not my cloth , I 'll baste thine until thy poor puny bones rattle ! Fellow in sooth  --  sore times have come to Merry England when Holy men are followed by paunch-bellied popinjays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fellow ! Now may  --  p. 14 HUGH Peace , drunken fool ! ' T is the High Sheriff of Nottingham ! FRIAR TUCK ( Astounded ) Nay ! SHERIFF ( Proudly ) It is , indeed ! FRIAR TUCK ( Sadly ) And I knew thee not ! ' T is true the ale was strong ! The High Sheriff of Nottingham ? SHERIFF ( Straightening up ) No less a man . FRIAR TUCK I take back all I called thee . ( Crosses R. of HUGH , to SHERIFF . ) Paunch-bellied popinjay , me thinks it was ? SHERIFF I can not pardon it . ( Waves his hand . ) FRIAR TUCK And no more brains , methinks I said , than fleas have manners ? SHERIFF Enough ! It ill bears repeating . FRIAR TUCK I knew you not  --  ' t is my only excuse  --  ( Awkward bow . ) SHERIFF I know  --  poor soul  --  I know ! ( Grandly . ) FRIAR TUCK Had I known thee for the High Sheriff of Nottingham , ' t is not thus I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly ) I trow ' t is not ! FRIAR TUCK ' T is not , indeed ! Had I known thee , I 'd have called thee addle-pated , empty-headed , purse-proud windbag ! ( Chases SHERIFF around R. ) SHERIFF Art mad ? ( After landing R. ) FRIAR TUCK Nay  --  a philosopher ! ( L. ) SHERIFF How will I  --  ( Starts L. ) FRIAR TUCK Peace , Sheriff  --  ( SHERIFF stops . ) Your windy words do blow thoughts of gallantry away . Lady , the hand that holds thy arm is most unlovely and hath not been lately washed  --  Art tired of it ? MARIAN I am , indeed ! FRIAR TUCK Then it shall be removed ! ( TUCK reaches forward suddenly and taps HUGH 'S arm smartly with his quarter staff . HUGH roars with pain and rage and jumps back up stage a bit , dropping MARIAN 'S arm . ) SHERIFF Observe ! How now ? FRIAR TUCK Good manners , poor simple Sheriff  --  but I waste my breath  --  thou knowest naught of them ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ranting friar ! ( MARIAN R. enjoys scene , laughing . ) HUGH I will , master ! ( They engage . He draws his sword and thrusts at TUCK , who promptly swings his quarter staff and sends the sword flying high in the air . TUCK disarms HUGH when HUGH is on his left . HUGH grabs quarter staff , TUCK raises staff , sends HUGH off L. HUGH falls . ) FRIAR TUCK Annoy me not with thy puny sticker . ( As he disarms HUGH after tossing him L. ) Sit thee quietly and observe how sweetly I am about to soundly beat thy most unworthy master ! ( Starts R. ) SHERIFF Help ! Help ! ( He dodges behind a tree , closely followed by TUCK , who hits at him with his staff , both sides . MARIAN enjoys scene , laughing . ) FRIAR TUCK Wait ! Wait , ill-mannered one ! SHERIFF Help ! ( He runs faster . ) FRIAR TUCK ( As they go around the tree ) Wait ! I need all my breath to beat thee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 SHERIFF Will no one help me ! FRIAR TUCK Ah ! ( Blow , in earnest . ) ( HUGH up , and about to help SHERIFF when he thinks better of it . The SHERIFF falls , TUCK stands over him , raising the great quarter staff in both hands . As he is about to strike , ROBIN HOOD enters C. and sees them . ) ROBIN Nay , Tuck ! Hold thy hand ! FRIAR TUCK ( With raised club ) Just for one moment turn thy head away  --  ( turns L. )  --  good Robin Hood ! SHERIFF God 's mercy ! HUGH We are undone ! MARIAN Robin Hood ! FRIAR TUCK ( Swings club ) Sweet Robin , just one little love-tap ! ROBIN I know well thy love-taps , Friar Tuck . Hold thy hand ! FRIAR TUCK ' T is the false Sheriff of Nottingham ! ROBIN So ! Let me see ! ( TUCK raises staff . ) Nay  --  strike him not  --  Rise , Sir Sheriff ! FRIAR TUCK ( Disappointed ) Oh  --  ( Growling. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thousand crowns I 'll give thee , if  --  ROBIN Rise  --  SHERIFF I am a poor man , but  --  ROBIN Rise  --  SHERIFF Pounds  --  not crowns  --  a thousand  --  ( ROBIN HOOD draws his sword and gently pricks the SHERIFF , who springs up with a cry . ) Have mercy ! ROBIN How is it that the Sheriff of Nottingham comes almost alone to Sherwood Forest ? ( Turns L. ) MARIAN He pursued me , Robin Hood ! ( Steps down a bit . ROBIN turns to her with a bow . ) ROBIN Your pardon , Lady  --  You need fear him no longer . Here in Sherwood , we have little love for the Sheriff of Nottingham , and we suffer poor nor weak to be oppressed . SHERIFF She is my ward ! MARIAN Nay ! SHERIFF A hostage against her father 's debt to me ! ROBIN ' T is like thee to hold maid so fair for another 's debt ! FRIAR TUCK Aye  --  like him ! You wronged the world , Robin , when you bid me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been happily praying for the forgiveness of his sins . p. 19 SHERIFF ( Looks uneasily at TUCK ) I like not that priest  --  who would make trade for his holy office by killing a man first and shriving him after . ( Going R. of MARIAN and behind her . ) FRIAR TUCK ( Indignantly ) Now out upon him for a most fanciful knave ! He doth even object to death from this wordly hand  --  ( He hold out his great stick in his left hand . ) When I hold this one ready to lead his stumbling foot to Paradise ! ( He stretches forth his right hand benevolently . ) In good sooth , some men are never satisfied ! ( Turns up R. of tree a bit , growling . Exit HUGH quietly L. ) ROBIN Peace , Tuck  --  thy tongue is like the babbling brook ! FRIAR TUCK ( Turning back L. a bit ) A most lame and halting synonym ! My tongue hath little kinship to the liquid brook , ' t is dryer than the desert sands ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . TUCK glaring at SHERIFF . ) MARIAN ( To ROBIN ) Your pardon , sir , but time runs on apace ! I seek my father , who is even now riding toward Doncaster . I have that which he must hear before he leaves England  --  which is his purpose . I have heard too oft of Robin Hood to fear him  --  and now I ask thy aid ! p. 20 SHERIFF Aid of him  --  a robber ! ( Hastily . ) FRIAR TUCK ( Steps R. a bit , raises his mighty cudgel ) One tap , good Robin ! ROBIN Nay ! Hold ! ( TUCK lowers his stick with a doleful sigh , goes up stage a bit . ROBIN turns to MARIAN . ) He speaks but the truth , Lady  --  robber I am  --  outlaw and thief  --  MARIAN Robber of the rich  --  but protector of the poor  --  Outlaw because of laws made by such as he ! ( She glances disdainfully at the indignant SHERIFF . ) Thief perchance  --  since you filch from the bagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small mercy from those who make the laws ! I ask aid of him who breaks them ! ROBIN It is thine ! ( A step toward her . ) MARIAN Safe conduct through the forest until I find my father  --  freedom from his pursuit or from that of his men , who are ahead ! ROBIN That I can freely promise . Go  --  seek your father  --  ( Points L. ) Friar Tuck shall be your escort . Fear not ! Holy man though he is , he will protect thee ! ( FRIAR TUCK comes down a bit. ) p. 21 FRIAR TUCK By word and deed  --  my tongue for the saving of thy soul , my cudgel for the protection of thy body . ROBIN Her soul is not in danger , Tuck  --  your cudgel will suffice . FRIAR TUCK Thou art a sinful fellow , Robin Hood  --  at times I do despair of thee . Come , Lady  --  ( crosses L. )  --  where you go , I follow  --  but if Providence doth guide thy steps past some wayside inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for news . ROBIN See that thou ask for nothing stronger  --  until her safety is assured . FRIAR TUCK He sorely wrongs me , but I forgive him . If it be his will that I am to die of thirst  --  ( martyr air )  --  I must die and in good faith , I feel death near me . I have a dryness that doth foretell my end . ( He starts L. MARIAN crosses to him . ) MARIAN ( Points off R. ) There is a sweet brook of clear water but a few rods down the glade . FRIAR TUCK Aye ! By ill luck , but now I stumbled in it . SHERIFF Thou art mad to trust thyself alone to that drunken , roistering mock priest ! p. 22 FRIAR TUCK Mock priest ! Dear Robin ! ( Raises his cudgel as he starts toward R. ) ROBIN Nay ! Get thee gone ! ( Left hand raised . ) SHERIFF I do forbid it ! ( He steps forward . ) ROBIN Stand , sir ! ( He draws his sword  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The High Sheriff of Nottingham remains with me  --  go , Lady ! MARIAN I thank thee , Robin Hood . I had a companion but now  --  my tiring woman , Dorothy  --  and thou see her I pray thee tell her to return to the Castle of Nottingham  --  where I shall join her when I have seen my father . Again , I thank thee , Robin Hood . Come , sir . ( Crosses L. To TUCK . ) We must go in haste . ( She starts walking rapidly , TUCK protesting . ) FRIAR TUCK But , Lady  --  too much haste ill becometh us  --  MARIAN ( Goes faster ) I pray you , sir  --  ( At exit L.I.E. ) FRIAR TUCK It does show some lack of dignity and it doth sorely add to the burden of my dryness . ( They exit . ) ( During the scene , HUGH , the SHERIFF 'S man , has slipped away unobserved . ROBIN HOOD turns and looks for him. ) p. 23 ROBIN Thy man ! SHERIFF What of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The SHERIFF laughs aloud . ) Save thy laughter , friend  --  for if he summons help to thee  --  I needs must make thy body the barrier between us . ( The SHERIFF sober , partly draws , starts R. ROBIN threatens with sword . ) SHERIFF Good Robin Hood  --  gentle Robin Hood  --  I pray thee to be calm . I would not harm thee , Robin  --  In good sooth , thou needs not fear me . ROBIN I fear thee as little as I fear the birds that twitter overhead . This is Sherwood Forest , Sheriff  --  my merry men are all about  --  SHERIFF ( Afraid , looks around R. ) Then in mercy let me go  --  I like not thy men . ROBIN Thou art a coward ! SHERIFF Nay ! I am brave  --  very brave  --  but courage , good Robin , doth show itself in divers ways  --  in divers men . ROBIN Right well I see it ; in thee courage showeth itself as it doth in the gray fox  --  who attacketh only those more helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin  --  I like not to  --  ( A sound of singing is heard out L.3 E. ) ROBIN Hark ! SHERIFF What sound is that ? ROBIN Thy men , or mine ? SHERIFF I would I thought them mine . ROBIN A witless wish , for if thine they are , I 'll strike them through , and they seek to harm me ! ( He presents his sword at the breast of the trembling SHERIFF . ) SHERIFF Alas ! I am undone ! If mine you kill me  --  if thine I fear they 'll do it ! Death walks with me to-day ! ROBIN Peace , wretch ! Or Death taketh thee by the hand . Stand here . ( He crosses SHERIFF to tree where he takes position R. of SHERIFF . He draws SHERIFF behind tree . ) As you love life , make not a sound ! ( From L.3 E. the song grows louder and LITTLE JOHN , WILL SCARLET , ALAN-A-DALE and MIDGE , the Miller , enter , singing gaily . They bring with them as a prisoner the Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great state of anger and indignation . They cross toward the tree as ROBIN HOOD steps out. ) p. 25 ROBIN Well met , my merry men ! LITTLE JOHN ' T is Robin Hood ! BISHOP Robin Hood ! ROBIN You have a guest , Little John ? ( Pointing L. ) ALAN-A-DALE A worthy Bishop , Robin  --  whom we invited to journey in our company . ( Winking , etc . ) LITTLE JOHN ( Mad ) A surly knave with no ear for music . BISHOP Music ! Callest thou that horrid sound thou makest , music ? If thee indeed be Robin Hood , I charge thee bid these rogues of thine to free me . ROBIN My rogues , as thou namest them , know full well their lack of grace , and seek in thy holy company a light to guide their faltering footsteps .

( R. arm up . ) Almost past politeness . When we asked him of sacred things , he stormed . When we sang to him , he cursed  --  he lacketh both heart and ear  --  being all run to middle like an over-stuffed sack of grain . ( Winking back R. to ROBIN . He prods the fats stomach of the BISHOP with his long bow. ) p. 26 BISHOP Stop , clown ! ( Indignantly . He steps back angrily . ) I am the Bishop of Fairdale !

( The outlaws surround the BISHOP and SHERIFF. ) p. 27 SHERIFF We must not tarry , good fellows . ( Sweetly , cunningly . ) Right courteously have thee used us , but night cometh on apace  --  and we fear to lose ourselves in the forest depths . ( Starts R. a bit . ) ROBIN Alas  --  ( SHERIFF stops . ) We are sore to lose thy company  --  but if thou must go , why go thou must .

ROBIN Five pounds ? Sheriff ! Naughty , naughty ! I would not dare offend my willing lads . ( Points L. to all . ) Five pounds ? Wouldst hurt their tender natures ?

( JOHN and SCARLET search the SHERIFF and BISHOP and count out the gold . ) LITTLE JOHN ( With the BISHOP 's money bag ) He hath a brave store of gold here , Robin , mayhap we might sing him another song . ( Bantering , singing . Handing purse to ROBIN. ) p. 29 BISHOP Nay ! I pray thee  --  take the gold , but spare me that awful din ! ( Hands to his ears . ) ROBIN We take only what we ask .

SIR RICHARD ( Cross R. of DAVID , then speaks ) I pledge thee my word as a true knight that this  --  ( taking a few pieces of gold from his pouch )  --  is all the money I have in the wide world  --  and this must take me over seas or I am undone . ROBIN Thy word as a true knight ? ( A step L. ) SIR RICHARD Aye ! Search if thou must ! ( Spreads his arms . ) ROBIN Nay ! I take thy word  --  but I marvel greatly that thy gold is no more , and thee a knight ! SIR RICHARD All that I have  --  cattle and lands , yea , even the hand of my lady daughter , is pledged for debt to the Sheriff of Nottingham  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinsman , Guy of Gisbourne . This poor show of gold is thine  --  ( offers gold )  --  as I am thy prisoner  --  but when you take it from me , you rob me of my only hope  --  and give my daughter over to a most unworthy husband . p. 32 ROBIN How now , Sir Knight ! A lady 's fate in a few pieces of gold ? SIR RICHARD Without them my journey ends . I have word that King Richard of the Lion Heart is now in France . ( ROBIN HOOD starts joyfully . Band all glad , glancing at each other . ) The twenty thousand pounds I owe the Sheriff , I borrowed to loan to my king . I know that now in my necessity he would repay me , if I could but get word to him . Six months to a day I have , no more  --  if I fail by noon of that day to pay the twenty thousand pounds  --  castle and lands are forfeit and my daughter , whom I leave hostage , must marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King then hath returned from Palestine ? SIR RICHARD So men say  --  undone by traitors at home and abroad . I could not go with him and leave my child alone  --  so I loaned him all I had . Now the false Sheriff will not renew the bond and my only hope is in my king , or was , until I fell into thy hands . ( Sadly . ) ROBIN We will not rob thee , Sir Knight . ( L. hand on SIR RICHARD 'S shoulder . ) I thought all England knew Robin Hood too well to credit such a deed as that . Nay  --  more  --  we will aid thee . ( SIR RICHARD amazed with joy . ) Little John , of the money we but now took from the Sheriff of Notingham , give half to this Knight to speed him on his journey . p. 33 LITTLE JOHN Gladly , master . ( He gets one bag . ) SIR RICHARD Sir Outlaw , never have I known of man like you . Something of thy fame was told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBIN We live as best we can , Sir Knight , which is ill enough  --  but our hearts are as loyal to King Richard as thine own ; our arms as ready to defend him against his enemies ! SIR RICHARD He shall learn of this from me  --  and if , with God 's help , he returns safe to England , his free pardon shall reward thee  --  that on the word of Sir Richard of the Lea ! ROBIN ( Earnestly ) God send the day . Now , Sir Richard , go  --  a maid  --  thy daughter it may be  --  is seeking thee at Doncaster . ( Points L.3 E. ) You must have passed her . And thou meetest her not ' t is like that ' ere you return I and my men can be of service to her . Fear not  --  until the last hour of the six months you name has passed she shall not suffer at the hands of the Sheriff of Nottingham . My men shall guide you to the forest edge . Go lads  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee , Robin Hood ! ROBIN ( Takes his hand ) Stay not for thanks  --  thy journey beckons thee ! p. 34 LITTLE JOHN Come , Sir Knight .

ROBIN HOOD looks after them for a moment , then turns and is about to exit R. as GUY OF GISBOURNE , HUGH and two soldiers come from behind tree and throw themselves upon him . Struggle . ) GUY Hold him fast ! ROBIN How now ! GUY See that he doth not call . HUGH I have him by the throat ! GUY Truss him to yonder tree ! ( They bind ROBIN HOOD to the tree . ) Tightly  --  be not afraid of hurting him . Now ! ( He stands back looking et ROBIN HOOD . ) Know you the man ? HUGH ' T is Robin Hood .

GUY The Sheriff must be close at hand  --  we will bring him . Guard him well , Hugh  --  HUGH ' T were better to kill him now , master . GUY Nay ! Not till I find my uncle ! ROBIN Then God send thy uncle is lost . GUY Come , men ! Take not thy eyes off him , Hugh . If rescue threatens  --  strike deep as his friends advance ! Haste ! haste ! ( GUY and the two soldiers exit . HUGH crosses to ROBIN HOOD , laughing tauntingly . ) HUGH Thou are in a tight place , Robin Hood ! ROBIN Aye , my sweet-faced fellow , but I 've been in tighter . HUGH Nay ? ROBIN I was pursued into a cave by a wild boar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from me ! ( Folds arms . ) ROBIN I did not hide . As the cave grew narrower , I turned and faced it  --  as I face thee now . p. 36 HUGH Then mayhap thou talked it to death ? ROBIN Nay  --  ' t was like thee  --  too addle-brained to value words . HUGH What then ? It did not rend thee ? ( Flares up . A step L. ) ROBIN It came charging toward me , with open mouth  --  like thine  --  and as it sprang I thrust my arm full down its throat and seizing the roots of its tail , I gave a mighty pull  --  the poor beast was turned inside out and kept on charging in the opposite direction . HUGH ( After a moment 's thought , scratches head , turns front , then speaks ) Thy tale is not the truth ! ROBIN ' T was no tail of mine , ' t was the wild boar 's . ( Laughs . ) HUGH Wouldst make sport of me ? ( Turns L. ) ROBIN Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HUGH ( Starts to draw , re-considers ) When the Sheriff comes we hang thee !

ROBIN I doubt it not . ' Twill be kind of thee to laugh , sweet sir . God knows I 'll welcome death to rid mine ears of it . ( HUGH crosses away R. angrily , and as he does so the sound of loud weeping is heard out R. HUGH draws his sword and listens . The sound grows louder and DOROTHY enters , weeping and wailing . ROBIN HOOD is bound to the tree in such a position that to see him she must cross past tree . ) DOROTHY ( Entering L. ) O , woe is me ! Oh , alas and alack a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

From where they stand , they see only ROBIN HOOD 'S arms as they are bound behind him . ) ' T is the mighty Robin Hood whom I have captured  --  ' t was a fearsome struggle , but I bound him fast ! p. 39 DOROTHY Thee ? Alone ? HUGH There were others by as I remember it , but ' t was I who mastered him . ( Points R.3 E. ) Best go before the Sheriff comes  --  we are about to hang him ! DOROTHY Why go ? In all my life never have I seen a man hang ! ( Naive  --  no tears . ) HUGH It is not fitting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hush , Dorothy !

Mock tauntingly , she crosses around R. of tree three times . ) My mistress waits behind yon thicket ! I 'll lure that booby away . ( Points L. ) Then signal her and she will come . ROBIN How signal ? ( When she is out of range of HUGH , her whole manner changes . ) DOROTHY With thy mouth , poor ninny  --  ' t is one of its many uses . ROBIN Another is for kisses  --  come nearer , maid , my arms are bound ! DOROTHY ( Points L. ) The thicket lays too near , my mistress 's eyes are sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too bold with her , Robin Hood  --  at least until your cords are loosened !

( She takes his R. arm . ) Come Hugh  --  set me upon my road . HUGH I can not . DOROTHY A rod or two  --  ( Pulls him R. ) HUGH I dare not ! DOROTHY He is safe . When bound by might like thine what mortal man could free himself ? Come , Hugh ! ( She draws him toward R.3 E. ) HUGH If Guy of Gisbourne returned and I not here , my life would pay for it .

ROBIN strains at his bonds . ) ROBIN Signal , she said  --  in faith , how doth one signal to a lady ? MARIAN ( Sings out L. ) He promised he 'd buy me a fairing , would please me ; And then for a kiss he said he would tease me ; He promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbon , To tie up my bonny brown hair . ( She stops . ROBIN sings . ) ROBIN ( Sings ) He promised he 'd bring me a basket of posies , A garland of lilies , a garland of roses.A little straw hat to set off the blue ribbon , To tie up my bonny brown hair .

MARIAN In spite of what you did for me , and for my father , whom I left but now upon his road . ROBIN What have I done ? MARIAN ( Sits stump R. ) Enough to anger my mind , though ' t was no more than I myself did  --  thou hast forgotten me , Robin Hood  --  as I did thee  --  ROBIN Forgotten thee ? Now may I  --  MARIAN Rises , L. hand out , crosses L. to him a bit ) Do not swear , Robin Hood , lest thou be foresworn ! Ten years and more ago I paid a visit to my mother 's aunt  --  ( banteringly )  --  the Lady Prioress of Rothdale .

( Laughingly , turns L. ) ROBIN The little maid I knew was sweet and tender . MARIAN Years bring changes , Robin Hood . The boy I knew did hang his head in bashfulness that time I  --  ( Banteringly , up to him . ) ROBIN Kissed me ! MARIAN The bashfulness is gone  --  ( she turns R. of stump )  --  as I must go .

My aunt , the Lady Jane , will remain with me , although I trust her not . p. 47 ROBIN ' T is an ill place for thee , but I will guard thee . ( She turns R. Kneels on stump . ) Always will I have one of my men lying at the forest outskirts . If danger threatens , thou needst but tie thy handkerchief to thy window casement , and I will come . MARIAN ( R. turns L. ) To Nottingham Castle ? Thou art mad ! ROBIN Try me , lady ! ( Hands out . ) Remember that day or night thou hast but to send  --  and I will not fail thee . Now come , I will see thee in safety to the forest edge  --  ( As they turn to go , HUGH , GUY OF GISBOURNE , the SHERIFF and his soldiers enter .
