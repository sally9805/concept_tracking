txt Hold-up men with a His Crime college education have Has been rare . But a No Excuse . Young Missourian , HODGES , has made a far from brilliantly successful effort to break into the profession of which he , presumably , had read much of late . How well he utilized the opportunities at the University of Kansas is not revealed , but one notices that the only claim to distinction as a student offered iziy him related to his prowess in the field of athletics . If he learned anything else , it was not wisdom . He says that he robbed the restaurant on a sudden impulse . His purchase , not long before , of the imitation pistol with which he cowed the restaurant keeper indicates that the " impulse " was of some duration . And he was not driven to theft by desperate need . He had a  --  little money left when he committed his cr me , and when he said that in his few days here he had been unable to get a job he must have meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind he wanted . In his behalf it can not be said , as for most of the young men guilty of like crimes , that he was the victim of bad environment in childhood  --  a product of the slums and the streets , of ignorant or neglectful parents . He had what are called " early advantages , " and there seems to be no reason at all for putting responsibility for what he did on " society . " And if he , had eluded arrest and had got away with the . money he stole , would he have turned virtuous then , or would he have gone on along the road thus opened to life without work and be , come a Chapman and ended on the I gallows ? Another question As Exemplar in regard to I:MD ( 1ES He Serves is the extent of a Purpose , punishment he deserves . His mother says that his crime was nothing ' but a " prank .

It can not be charged against him , indeed , . as against other hold-up mans that he was ready to kill if ' his selected victims resisted . But if he had been better supplied with money would he not have bought a real pistol , in stead of a cheap and harmless imita- I tion of one , before starting out to rob ? The chances are that Hoopes will get off rather easily . His was a first offense , so far as known , and he did not hurt anybody . His experience , fortunately , is not calculated by its results to allure other amateurs into the career which for him was so short . Of all the Roman Which One Catholic priests in the Are We Pennsylvania coal reto Believe ? gions , the Rev. .1 . .7 . CuERAN of WilkesBarre is certainly the best known . And he is much respected by all who know him . In many strikes he has been a prominent figure , but always as one striving to restore peace on decent terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners rather than with the mine operators , he is not the less deserving of admiration on that account . What Father Curator says therefore must be believed . He certainly intends it to be true , and when he speaks of what goes on in his own country and among his own people he is more than likely to be accurate as well as honest . That gives weight to his testimony ' before the Senate committee as to the effects of prohibition as seen among the coal miners . He declared those effects to have been good , and he was not the less emphatic because it raised a direct issue of veracity with another Roman Catholic priest , the Rev. FRANCIS KASACSUN. whose parish is in Sugar Notch , a suburb of Wilkes-Barre . Father Khsikezurt told a dreadful tale about women and children driven wholesale to drunkenness by prohibition , about stills in every other workingman 's house , and of an infant hardly out of arms whose pathetic moan was I " Moonshine , mamma , moonshine ! " All this Father CURRAN explicitly denied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of this conflict in the testimony of two men , each under every obligation to be veracious ? Father Cutunkx is Irish anti Father KitsAczuN presumably is a Slay . Their sources of information , therefore , are different , and this may account for the discrepancy . But the episode is only an extreme case of what marks so much testimony in regard to prohibition . The indubitable facts are not to be obtained by any such inquiry as the one now going on in Washington . Those who hear or read the testimony , to reach a conclusion , must ignore just about half of it and take only what they like . A. fine simile was One Tree that of Mr. N. GasPulled CIA NARANJO , the ediTwo Ways . tor from Mexico , when he compared the ? republics of the Western world to a great tree , and said : " All of the nations are the leaves of that one tree and an tremble in the same wind , " The analogy went astray a little , however , as all analogies are apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In the same Autumn we turn , and we fall under the influence of the same Winter , only to be born again in the same Spring . " For Mexico and the United States that is right , because they are In the same hemisphere , but the nations below the Equator reverse our seasons , and one tree would be terribly strained in trying to respond to influences so contradictory . There was no doubt , however , as to what Mr. NARANJO meant , and if it was an aspiration rather than an actuality the expression of an ideal often hastens its attainment .
