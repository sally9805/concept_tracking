Macbeth Macbeth , Knickerbocker Theater , November 19 , 1923 . THE point of departure for this " Macbeth " of Mr. George Tyler 's , as a part in his " annual presentation of famous masterpieces , " was the designs by Mr. Gordon Craig . That fact ten years ago would have made a great stir in our midst , but nowadays it came softly into the public ear , mildly important . This is partly because the name of Gordon Craig is no longer news ; he is a source now rather than a sensation , as Darwin has come to be in science . It is partly because there is less interest in the serious discussion of the theater just now ; partly because that aspect of the theater that decor represents is less to the front than it was ; and partly because Mr. Gordon Craig 's ideas have spread into the very texture of the theater and even into the realm of the moving pictures , which from anywhere and anybody , Russia , Germany , designers , painters , authors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be said that no little of this indifference derives from the fact that Mr. Craig himself did not come over to America . What we see at the Knickerbocker is scenery taken from the designs he sent , but not actually created under his eye and hand . That Mr. Gordon Craig is one of the outstanding geniuses in the history of the world theater is obvious . He has himself gone through with , more or less , a handful of productions in Moscow , London , Copenhagen , Florence and elsewhere , none of which I have seen . From all reports they came off with varying completeness and satisfaction , and certainly with stimulating imagination and prophecy , though with a veritable wellspring of vituperation and violence among the tempers involved . Whether he could ever carry his ideas through or not is one question , and another is whether he really in his last , subconscious self ever quite wanted the theater ? his own theater , safely bolstered with endowments ? that virtuous hearts have wished for him and his experiments . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a seed , an upheaval , a light and power in the art of the theater , not only on its visual side but with regard to the whole production . His influence is evident in the modern Russians , in Reinhardt , in Granville Barker and lesser men in England , in Mr. Robert Edmond Jones and Mr. Norman-Bel Geddes and other designers in America , in Spain , in Italy , in the whole modern theater . Some have fed their talents with his substance , some have turned it into paying enterprise . Everyone who knows anything about the modern theater knows this . Everyone knows , therefore , that Mr. Craig 's aim and scope has not rested with decor , but has extended to the theatrical event as a unit . His conception is that of the one directing mind behind all the elements together ? the play , the acting , the design , the directing ? as they contribute to the entire event . His share in this " Macbeth " includes nothing of all this except the design , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are those who say that it was not ethical , or something of the kind , for Mr. Gordon Craig to turn over his designs to another man and not come over and see them through himself , and that he is therefore subject to be judged by the result . But this is nonsense ; he has as much right to sell his designs to a producer as the dramatist has to sell his play or as the costume designer to sell his plates ? so long , that is , as the production does not claim to be his , which this does not and need not try to do . If we want to pass a judgment on him thus for the high pleasure of such functioning , that is our business , but it will not do much toward an understanding of his quality and meaning in the theater . As a move on his part toward a practical , paying place in our theater this is all another discussion . It must be said , nevertheless , that to turn over designs like Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage mass , color , light and surface textures , is about as if El Greco supplied . somebody with a sketch and a color card from which to paint one of his pictures . At the hands of Mr. Robert Edmond Jones , for example , who designed so remarkable a " Macbeth " some years ago , these designs might have come to birth either better or worse than what Mr. Craig had imagined . Under the hands that have brought them to us now , they come , with one or two exceptions , to nothing at all . Scenically it is a somewhat hideous evening offered us at the Knickerbocker . The costumes were of the old-style Lohengrin tradition , not bad on Christmas cards in the Victorian manner , but astonishing in front of Craigish settings . They hit bottom in Lady Macbeth , who wore for the murder scenea black afternoon affair , up-to-date in figure and showing beneath it a stretch of light stockings and high-heeled satin shoes , and for the banquet scene a sort of Madame Jeritza Madison Avenue effect that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , these costumes would have muddled the issue . As to the designs behind these settings , anyone truly interested may look at a series of them presented in the Theater Arts Monthly Magazine for November , remembering as he looks that much may be drawn in charcoal , where the thumb can rub in such miracles of pregnant nuance , that is a wholly different matter when it comes to stage embodiment . Most of these designs seem to me not very notable , and not , this late in the day , very significant . The outline of the castle seat I thought striking enough , and the notes for the witches would once have seemed to me suggestive , the varied levels too . Once , but not now , for time , alas , takes off the edge from the motives and devices in all art and sadly dims the flourish set on them . The design for the castle scenes , the king 's arrival and afterward the circumstances of his murder , I thought superb . That arrangement of square shapes , with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be spilt , was full of deeply dramatic imagination even as it came off at the Knickerbocker , badly painted as that was and inexpertly lit . Parts of the witches ' scenes might have pleased such as have a taste for a certain obvious chiaroscuro . Most of the settings were much too near the front of the stage and appallingly lighted . It is only too easy to imagine that in the whole sheaf of designs that Mr. Gordon Craig created , there were many beautiful motives and elements that are not even suggested in this production as we see it . Mr. Lyn Harding gave a dignified performance of Macbeth , in good taste but lacking in power and force , and much too monotonously a case of neurotic decay like that of his Tsar Paul in " The Patriot " of last season . His reading lacked in general variety and attack . When Miss Florence Reed , at her first moment on the stage , began to decipher Macbeth 's letter I thought that , whatever else might be lacking by way of subtlety or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Macbeth with a certain raw and primitive energy and edge that would at least refresh the role and rouse the energy so often lost from her scenes . But a mechanical approach to the part was soon apparent , a hopeless rhythm , a meaningless phrase and idle vocalization . The sleep-walking scene was wrong in every way ; the stair turned out poorly , the doctor and nurse had costumes suitable for Plymouth Rock , Miles Standish and the music master of melodrama , and Lady Macbeth missed the entire effect of the scene , which ordinarily one would think might carry itself . A certain continuity of movement is , above everything , necessary in this scene , a movement containing the whole trance of it , the life carried on by forces beyond its control , the haunted mind and tragic helplessness , the silver light of dream and sleep . Miss Reed broke up her movement into mere empty starts and stops , and did nothing with the lines . During the first part of this scene , as Lady Macbeth came down Ole steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , a heavy breathing which I took to be some man furth0 down toward the stage , who had fallen asleep . People have told me that it was not so , but a part of the player 's portrayal of sleep . I can not believe that such could be true , but if it is true it must serve forever as the immortal high-water mark of all attempts at misplaced realism ever made in poetic drama . The two murderers of Mr. Bernard Savage and Mr. Harold Thomas seemed to me excellent performances . " Macbeth " presents many difficulties and problems in production , three or four of which we may note here . It is a primitive and barbaric history done over into seventeenth-century matter . This means that in Shakespeare 's time it could be understood partly by that core of barbarism so entrenched in the Anglo-Saxon breast , and partly by the contemporaneity of its mind , which gave it its final place with the audience . For us it is different . We see the two elements , primitive and Renaissance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complexity separate us from this work of art . " Macbeth " takes advantage of its privilege , as poetic method , to say many things , and in many ways , that realism can not accommodate . In speaking the lines of such long passages as that of Macbeth 's about sleep , for instance , we must discover a method that will convey the effect of the mind 's being opened so that we see its contents , which may all be present in one flash . To read the passage with breaks in it , as if these reflections arose as one bit of thought after another , is only to make the character sound rambling or irrelevant to the dramatic moment and truth , and the dramatist more or less talky or false . We must face , too , the Elizabethan intention of continuous flux in the action and scenes , a continuity based on short waits or none between the scenes , and on declamation and vitality in the acting ? that fifth act battle , for example . None of these problems ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this production at the Knickerbocker . But we may say , at least , that the general level of the English spoken was better than in any Shakespearean production in recent Broadway seasons .
