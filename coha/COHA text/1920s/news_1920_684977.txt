txt One of the leading piano makers of England has closed his factory because he can not meet the demands for wages . Before the war six men would make a piano in a week , but now it requires twenty-six men to do the same work . The wages alone exceed the selling price of pianos , and now the polishing alone is equal to the prewar cost of a complete piano . He has no quarrel with his workers , and does not contend with them or their arguments. ? He simply can not keep his factory going . This is not an isolated case . The President ? of the British Piano Manufacturers ' Association says that Germany will ' take the British piano trade if British production is not enlarged . Before the war all piano work was piece work , but the trade has conceded demands about wages and hours until the production has fallen off from 25 to 40 per cent . It seems that nothing but such sharp lessons as this will convince labor that there is merit in the plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have work to do . Too many labor leaders are blind to the fact that wages paid out of either capital or profits must stop somewhere , but that there is , no limit to production as a source of wages if they ara fixed on economic . considerations rather than as the result of surrender to the power to stop work in ruthless disregard of all interests except those of labor . That is as true of national interests as of the interests of capital . For another British example , there are now more than half a million of unemployed in England , and theTrades Union Congress is asking unemployment doles out of profits , after such doles out of taxes have proved too grievous to be borne , and are seen to be an undue encouragement to idleness . Instances have been cited when men have refused to work because they could exist on the dole doing nothing , and the wage above the dole was unattractive . No doubt British labor is sincere in some of its ideas , as , for example , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners . But the profits are trifle compared to the cost of nationalization , unless it is established by confiscation , at the cost of wrecking British institutions . These examples are British , but the idea is not confined to England . There are plenty of examples on this side the ocean that labor organizations do not limit their economic power by any rule of reason . The strikers here who won their demands by a threat to stop the heat of large apartments and hotels , the Montreal strikers who won by their threat to ' stop the water works , won dangerous victories . Capital would riot be supported in like inhumanity toward the workers , and is under great pressure to make all reasonable concessions . But the piano case shows that there are demands which capital can not grant , and there are other demands which capital is tempted to resist in the same ruthless manner In which they are made . When work stops wages take on added attractions , for idleness with hunger is an argument which it is not prudent to risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
