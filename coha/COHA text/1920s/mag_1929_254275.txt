The leading article in the April American Mercury was a bitter denunciation of the " Progressives " of the Senate written by a person who , to insure his future comfort in Washington , D. C. , signed himself simply " A Washington Correspondent . " <P> Excerpts from the article : <P> " With the exception of Norris of Nebraska , now dejected and despondent over the hopelessness of his long struggle , and Tom Walsh of Montana , an able man but always vain and sometimes sentimental , the so-called Progressives in the United States Senate are a sorry bunch of weaklings and timeservers . The Liberals of America are always getting fooled , but never have they been worse fooled than by this small , forlorn and measly gang of false leaders . <P> " Brookhart , Blaine , Borah , Frazier , Howell , Johnson , Dill , La Folle " ? . Shipstead , Nye , Wheeler , all come within the category . There is little intellectual or moral fibre in any of them . They pother , trim and hedge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hirsute adornment of a drug-store yahoo and practises the political disingenuousness of a Jim Watson . " <P> Blaine- " is peerless in blatancy . . . . On a heavy gold chain across his paunch he sports a large Elk 's molar , a gift from admiring lodge brothers . " <P> Frazier- " looks like a boss butcher . " <P> Brookhart- " simple man that he is , glories in the resultant public attention . " <P> Wheeler- " devotes himself wholly to pot-shooting . ... In a floor fight he is a total loss . " <P> Shipstead- " His paucity of achievement , his colossal bombast , his lack of aggressiveness , his ardent playing of the political and social game , are a complete summary of the worth and role of the entire Progressive group , with exception of Norris . " <P> Borah- " The biggest sham of them all is the principle-peddler from Idaho , the Great God Borah. "
