Simultaneously with a discussion in the Yale Corporation of the desirability of retaining Latin and Greek as requirements for the B. A. degree , arrives in the United States , and in New Haven , Sir Frederick Kenyon , noted classical scholar and director of the British Museum . <P> Sir Frederick is imported by the American Classical League as a mobile expeditionary force with objectives in New York , Boston , Montreal , Chicago , Cincinnati , Washington , Baltimore , Philadelphia , as well as New Haven . And so far he has met little resistance . Newspaper comment is , curiously enough , rather favorable to the classics than otherwise , though the basis of favor is not always classical . One editorial writer insists , for instance , that Latin and Greek can not be considered defunct so long as botanists use Latin names for plants and physicians rely upon the ancient tongues for titles for their drugs . <P> But compulsion is another matter . Sir Frederick himself has doubts as to compulsion . In his Boston address he alluded to the neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of Latin and Greek . Since the war the classics , everywhere compulsory before that time , have been relieved of their penal character , and the sciences , the new wisdom of humanity , have taken their place . The result has been a renewed interest in Latin and Greek and a somewhat diminished eagerness for scientific corners . <P> But here is another angle to the question , as several editorials have hastened to aver . Compulsion , in and of itself , may be desirable . It can not be true that the entire adult population of the globe which , in so far as it was educated at all , was educated by compulsion , suffered needlessly . A long line of **29;6901;TOOLONG Senators and Generals and Presidents answers , No . Discipline is necessary to the human soul , and compulsion is necessary to discipline . It follows that Latin and Greek should be required for the B. A. degree . <P> It is to be presumed that neither this , nor any other of the similar arguments which the discussion has inspired , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the general lack of agreement as to educational problems . There is , however , an argument for the retention of the classics as compulsory subjects of education which can not be ignored . It is the argument that the classics have now been taught so long that they can not be dropped . It does not rest upon the respective glories and grandeurs of Athens and Rome . It rests merely upon the fact that Greek and Roman thinking is the core of our culture ; that without the literatures of these two tongues we are without an understanding of our traditions ; that cut off from our traditions , we are novices where we should be adepts . <P> If the great universities , with their manifold departments and courses and degrees retain no common courses in any way related to the history of the race they will graduate men and women who will have nothing in common but their clothes . They will not even talk the same tongue , though they may all speak a dialect of one language . They will be free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
