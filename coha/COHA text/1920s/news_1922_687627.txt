txt President Harding 's support of the action of the Interior and Navy Departments in entering into a contract with H. F. Sinclair , courting the fullest . investigation , is said by those *ho have been following developments as foreshadowing a disclosure of a new departure of the government on broad lines which will result in a big saving to the government and materially aiding progress in the Far West and in Alaska . Mr. Sinclair , before the agreement with the government was entered into , took all the necessary steps to safeguard the government project from delays by litigation by personally acquiring all private rights on Teapot Dome which have accumulated from time to time before the naval reserve was proclaimed . These deeds were turned over to the government . Many oil men here are of the opinion that the present objections to the policy of the government in Wyoming by producers of crude are much exaggerated . They point out that instead of being against their interests nothing could better serve them than to have Sinclair develop Teapot Dome and construct a pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to ship only about 40 barrels to market . In a very short time it is said Wyoming producers will be asking the Sinclair Company to erect a refinery at Casper so that their surplus can be taken by both refinery and pipe line . The attacks on the government oil contract seem to have hastened the completion of the general plan of saving the oil reserve to the Interior Department , as reflected in the closing of contracts to Reserves Nos. 1 and 2 in California with the Pan-American Co . The two striking things in the official statements are that the Sinclair producing conwany. the Mammoth Oil Co. , will pay the government from 121,2% to 50. ? c in royalties on the entire reserve , the rate being regulated . This means very considerable revenue for the government . The announcement is also made ' that the contract involves the supply to the Navy of all of its fuel oil , gasoline . lubricants and other petroleum-products needed on the Atlantic sea-1 board . with delivery as far south as Guantanamo and as liar north as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought after in the oil industry and now falls into the lap of Sinclair .
