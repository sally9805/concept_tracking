THE old boma ' in the Chikala range , where I lived over six months , had been uninhabited for almost ten years when I entered it . Although it would be classed , in Europe , as quite a young house , it is an old one for Tropical Africa , where houses age in a decade as much as they do in Europe in a century . No one would look for a house in the remote and savage locality where it stands , twenty miles from the nearest white settlement , while the nearest Yao village is scattered at the foot of the mountain , ' there being no native inhabitants at all on this eastern part of the range . The boma , as its name implies , has been , during the brief period of its commission , a tax-collector 's residence ; it is built of brick , with a corrugated-iron roof , a large veranda , and bow windows , and its interior still shows many signs of the taste , and the love of comfort , which directed the builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that the structure could have , unattended and unlooked after , resisted the destructive effect of time and the seasons . There is scarcely a bow window with all the panes entire , not a curtain left , not a brass bolt unbroken . Stains and rusty nails on the walls bear testimony to the artistic proclivities of the last inhabitant ; the wainscoting is , in many places , de-50 tached from the walls ; the white-calico awnings stretched underneath the ea ings of the rooms are torn in parts , and in parts stained and eaten by the droppings of the bats . Only the beautiful fireplace of carved cedar has remained intact , with the added beauty of patina acquired with age . The many traces of past comfort and elegance , the present dilapidated and neglected condition , the savage aspect of the stir . rounding scenery , the magnificent hushes of European roses right in front of the veranda , a grove of thick mango trees just behind the house ? all these contrasts give I o the old borne a touch of romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fairy tale . It is built on a terrace , about 2000 feet above the plain , and is surrounded on three sides by an amphitheatre of hills , which form part of the main range . This , the Chikala range , runs from east to west . The amphitheatre , from its eastern and western wings , rises grade . ally to a dome of granite over .5000 feet high , the highest point of the range , due north of the house . The latter faces south , embracing a view of half the compass over plains and mountains . To the left , Lake Chirwa ? ten miles away at its nearest point during the dry season , but approaching its boundaries according to the volume of water brought by the rains ? runs south deleted materialsubmerged by the horizon , past and far round the water , and when a man has passed lake , into Portuguese territory , with a few breaks only , through which the plain rolls on into the unknown . Here and there , in the champaign , isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic island mountains ' of Tropical Africa . In the Ny-ika of East Africa those hills rise at regular intervals from the level plain . There I noticed a curious particular . I have climbed none on which I did not meet , somewhere near , or on , the top , a puff adder larger in size than any which I have ever seen elsewhere , either free or in captivity ? a weird genius loci , probably centuries old , letting the time rush by while it lies in a lethargic state of eternal digestion , punctuated by single meals at intervals of months . As none of my Masai companions ever showed the slightest inclination to kill one of these anehodtes , but appeared to be opposed to Illy doing so , I came to the conclusion that they must be fetish . Whether the mountain islands of Nyasaland share this peculiarity , I have not , so far , had occasion to ascertain . Lake Chirwa , however , enjoys a zoologic speciality also ? an almost . unique distinction . The many crocodiles which inhabit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! So I was assured by all those inhabitants of the lake shore whom I consulted on the subject . I asked them if The high Mlanje mountains sometimes , at sunset , seem to intercept , with their dark-blue mass , the glare of an immense conflagration , the shine of which just peeps over the outline of their pinnacles ; at other times they are hidden by a bluish-gray wall of vapor , fringed with lilac all along the top ; while the sky just above them is of an intense , luminous orange , which , as the night advances , grows blood-red . Often , in the early morning , the whole plain is covered with a sheet of low-lying white mist , out of which the island mountains emerge like rocks out of a frozen arctic sea . Or else the lake alone , brilliant like a mirror under the horizontal rays of the rising sun , is covered as if with cotton-wool by a layer of densely packed white clouds , which follow its contours just as if they had been spread there by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape never loses that indescribable something which characterizes all African landscapes ? something intensely melancholy , brooding , and ominous , as if some terrible event were held in suspense . Clouds , as Sir Martin Conway says , are not a bit less beautiful than mountains , and they form , with these , during the rainy season , combinations and groups which remind one of Dore 's illustrations to Dante 's Inferno . ' Each chain of mountains will act independently of all the others , with its own particular set of clouds , its own thunderstorms , its own strokes of lightning . One range may be swathed in a sheet of torrential rain , while the other , through a rent in the clouds overhanging it , is struck by beams of sunlight . Occasionally , however , when it rains for good , a perpendicular , solid , gray wall of rain creeps slowly , from the fast disappearing mountains , over lake and plain toward Chikala ; then the plain vanishes , then the solitary tree at the far end of my terrace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one continuous , deafening roar . One would imagine that no living creature , except a fish , would enjoy getting a tropical downpour on its back . To this my two ravens , Grip and Nevermore , ? chance acquaintances with whom I have formed a solid friendship , ? are exceptions . Instead of seeking shelter , which they could find in abundance far and near , they will , when overtaken by the avalanche , sit on an exposed granite boulder , their backs to the wind , with shoulders raised and head bent , like Mr. Dom . bey 's brother-in-law when his wife annoyed him , and apparently sink into a kind of torpor , as , under these condi. tions , they refuse to respond to the most tempting morsels of food ! The Champaign is most beautiful during the period of the veldt tires , which begins toward the end of October and lasts until the rains are on . In the daytime the flames are invisible from here ; but in calm weather great col ? umns of smoke rise , like Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , and spread out in the sky to tremendous black clouds , which intercept the light of the sun and plunge into shade half the plain . In stormy weather , the spirals of smoke rolling fast along the ground look like the steam of express trains running full speed . At night the flames are visible , and then the bush-fires look like burning cities , and make the onlooker think of seek and rapine and murder . Where they burn low , they suggest the keys of an organ of fire touched by invisiblefingers . The lake has its fires , too , but they begin later and cease later . It is full of reeds in many parts , and these the natives burn , to facilitate fishing during the rainy season . But the most beautiful sight is when , in a still , calm night , the conflagration extends along a large segment of the eastern horizon , and the full moon rises out of it , as intensely luminous as the fire itself , like the birth of a planet out of a sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the lake , almost due east from here , lies the village of a chief called Chikweo , which has just now been the theatre of a lion story more than usually dramatic . For several months past , a man-eating lion had been spreading terror among the villagers by periodical appearances , which were nearly always the occasion of the killing of a man or a woman . Several times he was frightened away by the men appearing en masse after he had seized his victim , but he had killed fourteen , and wounded six , so I was told , before his career ended . This came about in this way . An old woman , who belonged to another tribe , had been living for some time at Chikweo 's village with her young laughter , who had a baby at her breast . These three were living in a but built of logs , on the outskirts of the village . With characteristic native improvidence , on the night in question , in the early part of last December , they lept with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and jumped on ! he old woman . In a moment the 4laughter had made up her mind ? to save the baby and sacrifice the mother . /ihe slid out of the but with the child , ailed the door to , dragged a heavy . ag of wood against it , and gave the alarm . With the rapidity with which natives are capable of acting in an emergency , the villagers collected , brought more igs of wood , built a strong barricade II round the but while the poor old woman was still alive and screaming : or help ; and then they sat down in a circle and ? it was before midnight ? waited for dawn . At dawn ? the old woman by that time was dead ? the chief Chickweo came with his Snyder , jumped on to the roof , gave , through a hole , one shot to the lion , and went home to sleep , having , by drawing first blood , secured the government reward . After that , the lion was finished off by others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly with spears . It is possible that the woman might have been saved , if , instead of closing the door upon her and her terrible guest , her daughter had contented herself with rushing out and calling for help ; or even if the people had reopened the door of the hut , as the lion would perhaps have been frightened by the noise and the sight of so many people , and might have tried to rush out . But the villagers thought that such an occasion to get the man-eater would never return if they let it slip . If one considers how great is the love of natives for their mothers , ? it is their one pure sentiment , ? one can imagine how violent must have been , in the girl 's heart , the conflict between the love which she bore her mother and that which she felt for her child . The chief , sleek and debonair , called on me on his way to Tomba with the lion 's skin , and gave one all the details . When he mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suppressed a smile . He told me that the animal ? as could be seen from the skin ? was very old , with part of its teeth gone and the rest in a bad condition . That it was frightfully hungry became evident from the fact that it did not allow the vicinity of so many people to disturb it in its meal ; and that , after it had finished devouring its victim , of whom there remained only the head and the larger bones , it killed and ate all the chickens in the hut ! deleted material with isolated notes and increasing in number , until they seem to proceed from almost every one of the huge boulders . Birds or boys might whistle in this manner ; the virtuosi are , however , neither of these bipeds , but rock rabbits , of which a few families live among the rocks . These interesting , harmless little creatures have of the rabbit only the name ; they are no relations of those rodents , but actually the smallest cousins of the elephant . As climbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpendicular ( lat. surfaces , like lizards . Their nests , built adhering to the foot of overhanging boulders , resemble very large swallows ' nests . They are , unfortunately , prized as an article of diet by the natives , who persecute them ruthlessly . A large and beautiful lizard , common to all the mountainous countries of Tropical Africa , brings a bright touch of color to those granite boulders which it has elected as its domicile . Its head and neck are a brilliant chrome-yellow , its body sea-green , its tail turquoise-blue . Being of an inquisitive turn of mind , it scans the approach of the stranger with marked curiosity , by moving its head up and down , before it rushes to conceal itself in some crevice . II ' one keeps very quiet , however , it will come back , and , if she happens to be present , start courting its lady , indifferent to the fact that she has no beautiful colors to boast of on her plain brown body . It is very amusing to watch them at play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , at which latter game their habits are remarkably like those of dogs . In order to attract them to a certain rock , and accustom them to my presence , I tried to biro them with insects , which I de ? posited on the boulder ; but I signally . failed in the beginning , as live insects t of course ran away , and the lizards i would not touch dead ones . And then very loud croaking . When it happens to be their turn for occupation , they collect , every evening , on the tops of the largest boulders , and , in a chorus , call out their farewell to the setting sun . There is something touching in this cult of the sun practised by many animals ? the origin , perhaps , of man 's worship of the fixed star . When walking in the early morning , years ago , along the seabeach in Portuguese East Africa , and in Natal , in places where the virgin forest came down to the shore , I was always struck by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topmost branches , with outstretched arms , looking at the sun as it rose out of the Indian Ocean . Many of the larger birds greet the rising sun with the same gesture of adoration . The love of in mongoose for the sun amounts to a passion . A few years ago , I was living in a house to which the rays of the setting sun came , through a cleft in the bills , at one single spot only in the uninhabited back part of the house . A small mongoose that I had , although it hated to be alone , went there by it self every day when twilight was near , and , lying down on the veranda , watched the sunset . As soon as it was gone , she would quietly come back into the house , seek her couch , and go to sleep . As long as I lived in that house , she never once missed the sunset . Before she died , a few years later , she laboriously climbed up to the thatched roof of a but where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I had erected , gave a long , last look at the sun , then came down again with great difficulty , and died . On the top of the range , also to the east , live a couple of leopards . As they have been calling frequently , both at night and sometimes in the afternoon for several months past , they are supposed to have a family of young , this being a sure sign , the natives say . They prey largely on the baboons , and no doubt on the kimas also , although I have not been able to ascertain that for certain . But as to the baboons , I can occasionally follow by mere sound ? mostly at night but sometimes also in daytime ? the developments of the chase . The old males of the baboons , always en vedette , begin by uttering their cavernous barks , an imposing and even formidable sound , not unlike the leop. ard 's own , but of far greater volume ; the young males shout like boys of the human species , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd moving along up the slope while they produce these noises , which generally begin nearly at the foot of the slope , about level with my boma . From time to time , during a lull of the baboons ' harks and screams , the stalking leopard utters his grunting , halting growl . As a rule , the alert ends in nothing , the various noises ceasing gradually , as the baboons get out of reach and the leopard gives up the hunt . But when , instead of fizzling out , the adventure ends in pier ? . ing yells and screams , and the barks of the old baboons become howls of rage , I know that the great cat has been successful in securing a good meal for the family . If I want additional proof , I get it on the following morning , when my two ravens , which live in the forest not far from the leopard 's lair , make no appearance at early breakfast as they invariably do otherwise , but stay away till noon , and then show little appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind which blows no one any good , applies also to this predilection of leopards for baboon 's meat , quite apart from the benefit which they themselves and their clients may derive from it . Where many baboons live in a locality in. habited by leopards , the latter annoy the human inhabitants in the neighborhood very little , if at all . They do not go out of their way to capture goats 01 the villages always a risky thing to do ; and even dogs , which are so often killed by leopards , appear to be allowed to move about in comparative safety . This is perfectly accepted by the na- tives , who will not even prevent their small boys from climbing the moult , tain , into the leopards ' reserve . . Wild pigs stand to lions in the same relation as that of apes to leopards . Where lions live in the vicinity of wild pigs , the natives will treat them , as they do the leopards , as negligible quantities or where the pigs are destructive to crops ? even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maize is ripening , a couple of lions cross the Chikala range coming from the north , to make war on the wild boars which , at the same time , leave their forest haunts , to bring devastation into the fields . Why the lions should prefer , for these excursions , rainy weather to dry , is difficult to explain ; but it is a fact that , so far , the only nights in which they called out their warning were nights of pouring rain . Two things exist in nature , concerning which a mistake can never occur . These are the voice of the lion and the color of gold . Whoever hears the one or sees the other , knows what it is . This does not mean , of course , that the reverse is the rule also . Many men have mistaken the cry of the ostrich for that of the lion , and tenderfoots ' gold for gold . The lion 's voice ? his hunt , ng voice , not his roar , which is so seldom heard ? is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it belongs is unique . Although it is extremely powerful and carries to incredible distances , and although it sounds ominous , and sometimes awe-inspiring by implication , there is in reality nothing either cruel , or bloodthirsty , or even savage in the sound itself . To me it has always appeared as the most consummate expression of despair uttered by a powerful creature in moral , not in physical , distress . Of these Chikala lions the natives seem to have as little fear as they have of the leopards of the range ; and the knowledge that they are about does not prevent men from climbing up the mountain for bamboo or for wood . Some fifteen years ago , when the coffee and rubber plantations of the Usambara were still young , and much damage was done to them by the many herds of wild pigs which live there , the turning-up of a lion on an estate was looked upon as a favorable event by some of the German planters , who in consequence strictly protected him . In this connection it may be interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that pioneer 's letters , I believe , published by Dr. Franz Stuhlman . Somewhere in Equatoria , Emin 's followers had dug a pit to catch big game , and a lion fell in , As soon as this was known , a native from the neighborhood , owner of many cattle , came running , and implored Emin to let the lion go . He said that , in exchange for a weekly tribute of a bullock , the lion kept away all other beasts of prey , and himself , except his regular weekly allowance , never touched a head of cattle belonging to his ally . The man 's request was granted , a plank let down into the pit , and the lion climbed slowly out and went his way . I was assured in the Pare mountains of what is now Tanganyika province , that a native there had formed a similar alliance with a leopard which , against the regular supply of a goat , protected from all enemies the owner 's herds , and even slept in the loft of his hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , but there is nothing intrinsically impossible in it . Before the war , the German medical officer in charge of the sleeping-sickness commission on the west frontier of the colony , had a full-grown she-leopard , which was as tame as a dog . One of his colleagues told me that , whenever one of them returned home after an absence , the huge cat would stand up on its hind legs and rub its head against the face of its friend , in manner of welcome . A drawback was the circumstance that , at certain times , all the male leopards of the neighborhood appeared to have given themselves a rendezvous in the vicinity of the camp . The idyll , unfortunately , came to a tragic end , as those idylls always do , a statement for which one must leave the priority to fEschylus . The doctor 's leopard seized a dog belonging to a native ; the native attempted to interfere , and the leopard killed him instead . So sentence of death was passed and carried out on the affectionate creature . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance in the camp on the following day of the victim 's father , who simply said : I want my bakhshish . ' That leopards have a sense of humor , although of a somewhat grim kind , they show by their curious habit of planting the bare skulls of animals which they have killed and eaten on a forked branch high up a tree . Their common sense they show by their disregard of fire , which is so well known to natives who are accustomed to leopards , that they never use this means in order to keep them away from a but or a camp . These preventive measures are more successful where lions are concerned , but , even with regard to these , the sweeping notion imbibed in our childhood , that wild beasts are afraid of fire , ' requires revision . Some lions avoid the fire , no doubt , but certainly not all . In British East Africa the natives used to say that large , flaming fires irritate lions ; and I have certainly known cases where lions cleared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would appear as if the most effective fire against lions were a low-burning , not flickering or flaring , but steady fire . While the lion 's cry , on a dark rainy night , is a distinctly unwelcome sound to the traveler who sleeps in his tent , it has , on the other hand , when one hears it from inside four solid brick walls , an effect similar to that of a ghost story by a brightly burning fire , on a social winter evening . A beautiful and imposing bird , by its numbers and by its powerful voice , attracts attention on the range as effectually as do the two felines just mentioned . It is a fishing eagle , with head and neck and half the body snow . white , which owes to its remarkable vocal qualities its Latin surname ' . vocifer . From long before sunrise till long after dark its clarion-call ? which in some individuals resembles sonic . what the whinny of an excited stallion ? resounds about the heights of the range where it builds its eyrie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal that the night was nearly ores and the day approaching . When it calls , it behaves in a peculiar manner : it poises in mid-air , and , while uttering its shriek , frantically and simultaneous . ly moves up and down both head and neck and tail . It is exhilarating to see them dive for fish as I often did on Lake Nyasa . They ' take a header ' into the water like any human champion diver , to emerge again and fly up into the ad some hundred feet farther on , nearly always with large fish in their beaks They are fortunately on the ' protected ' list in this country . There are certain things , hist* taneous pictures of the memory , often in themselves mere trifles , the thaoht of which brings back with extraorb nary force the realization of the par . titular romance of a milieu ? like Zat hustra 's lizard , or Rudyard Kipling 's firefly in the cane . ' One may read whole books about Tropical Africa , without feeling its atmosphere with the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a croco ' . dile basking in the sun on a sand-bank by a lazy river ; or of a solitary elephant standing under a mimosa tree in an expanse of Sanseveria , spraying itself with red laterite dust ; or of lemurs dancing a fandango on the top of a coconut palm in the full moon of , Zanzibar . To this category belongs also the appearance of the baleleur eagle , most graceful of birds , sailing motionless have the champaign , under a clouded , Icy , a perfect Cupid 's arc in outline . The eeaudatus ? ho was treated nig2ardly by Mother Nature in respect to his modal appendage ? makes occasional appearances here , but never , like Ills vociferous cousin , penetrates far up he range , as he prefers the plains , of ? he is so characteristic an inhabitant . From the third or fourthyear on ; , rard these great birds of prey mature - lowly ; the jaws grow a scarlet red , eke these of some macaws , to which limy have a further ? moral ? re- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , they become fully as ame as a parrot . Large as it is , that nagnificent eagle feeds , according to he natives , almost entirely on rats and lice and snakes , and never becomes a anger to the poultry yard . No doubt , T beautiful colored plate of a bateleur , tacking a young jackal in Sir Harry hasten 's Uganda is either a libel , or le portrait of an exceptionally enter-rising individual . At the foot of Iv the range , Mposa 's t Hag straggles along , with interruptons , for nearly two miles . As is the case in all Yao villages , each hut , in size like a small cottage at home , stands in its own grounds , sometimes with a small patch of maize attached to it . Where there is no garden , the whole place is kept free of vegetation and well swept ; this gives to the village a singularly clean aspect . Here and there a very large tree stands by itself in grounds equally well swept , affording shade for palavers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails fly unmolested between the houses , although it is a favorite pastime of the boys to hide in the high grass with a long rod , and kill small birds , when they balance in the reeds , by hitting them with it . Wagtails , however , are fetish , and never touched . The Yao have given them the pretty appellation , doves of God . ' Children , goats , chickens , and dogs run about ; the grown-up men , when not at work , either sit before the chief 's house , or play cards in front of their own . The women , never idle , are occupied on various household tasks . On nearly all the roofs , fish from the lake , extended in rows , are drying in the sun , in a buzz of metallic flies . One kind of fish only is caught at the present season , a silurid in two or three sizes . The small ones , bent round in a circle , are stuck on rods in rows ; the larger ones are cut into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , which favors deep water , is not caught until the rainy season is well advanced and the shallow lake has attained its full size . It is well known that Sir Jonathan Hutchinson , the great English dermatologist , ? who , by the way , fruitlessly endeavored , some twenty years ago , to persuade the world to abolish leper-reserves as barbarous , inefficient , and unnecessary , ? ascribed nearly all occurrences of leprosy to the consumption of insufficiently cured fish . If this is really the fact , one does not see how , at least for many years to come , the evil can be stopped among the millions of natives around the lakes ; for one might as well expect them to give up breathing as eating fish . The establishment of curing-centres under government supervision appears to be the only practical solution . Chief Mposa 's principal house is conspicuous by its size and its elevated , matted veranda , with two deck-chairs . He himself ? quite apart from his picturesque attire , which consists of a red turban , a corduroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheath-knife ? certainly looks the most distinguished person in his village , being tall , dignified , and good-looking , with a short full beard . He might , from his aspect , be taken for a black Arab from Zanzibar . His subjects kneel to him , as he himself kneels to his invalided old mother ; but his authority does not appear to be of a despotic kind ; its chief manifestation probably consists in these outward tokens of respect . If Mposa 's ' grand air ' is due to his descent , this would furnish an argument to those who opine that the stronger qualities are inherited through women , as , in Yao dynasties , the laws of inheritance act in a way which one might compare to the advance of the knight on a chessboard . The sultan is succeeded , not by his own son , but by his eldest sister 's eldest son . It was , however , explained to me that , if this eldest son of the sister is very stupid , ' his younger brother will succeed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid also , the third , and so on . It would be interesting to know by what standard the intelligence of these potential heirs is measured . Mposa 's heir is being brought up here under his uncle 's eyes , although his mother lives in another district . I hear this was insisted upon by Mposa himself , which is certainly a sign of sound judgment . The boy is being looked after by his ' little mother , ' as the Yao call the aunt on the mother 's side . When a Yao mentions his mother , one never knows if he means his real mother or her sister . As a rule , he means the latter , because there is al . ways a reluctance to refer in speech to the direct progenitors , apparently from a sense of veneration and respect . The impression which the settlement makes is one of peaceful prosperity ? a truthful one on the whole , so far , although beer-fights , with broken heads , occasionally occur . Unfortunately the country is now threatened with a partial famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , in consequence of the insufficient rain . fall . It is true that the natives in the lake regions have an almost unlimited supply of fish to fall back upon , as well as ? here in Chikala at least ? reserves of rice , and the rock rabbits and blip-springers and other beasts of the moon . tam and of the plain ; but they could no more be expected to live entirely on these than the Parisians of Marie Antoinette could have lived on Ihe petits pains which the unfortunate Queen liked so much . But natives never bother much about the future , confident as they are that the Govern . ment will provide help if it comes to pinch ; besides , they are all fatalists , to a really exasperating extent . Even without food worries , however , life in Mposa 's village is not without drawbacks , one of the worst being the great quantity of mosquitoes bred in the neighboring swamps . The notion , entertained by some Europeans , that natives do not suffer much from mosquito-bites , is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are . How much they suffer from them en Mposa 's village can be judged from the pathetic device to which they have recourse at the beginning of the rains , before the cool weather begins , when mosquitoes are at their worst . They keep men walking about , with beating drums , far into the night , so as to be prevented from going to sleep early , as attempts at an early sleep would be frustrated anyhow ! So they are being kept awake by the drums until sleep really overpowers them , and then there is a chance of being able to outsleep the stinging . Sonic of them , however , are the lucky proprietors of mosquito-curtains ; and there can be no doubt that , if the remainder seriously desired it , they could , by practising only a little economy , and by refraining from spending on trifles every shilling earned , soon find themselves in the same position . But negroes one and all resemble that guardsman of Ouida 's , who , rather than go to the exertion of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their narrowness . On the whole , so long as it has sufficient to eat , the community appears to he as contented as any community ? which one could see in Europe , if not more so ; and there are always occasions of excitement , mostly of a mild description , to prevent it from getting , unduly bored ; as , for instance , the visit of the Resident or the Assistant Resident from Zomba , or that of a neighboring chief , or the passage of PoliceAskaris in search of a thief , or a beer ! fight , or a dance . Them are , besides , l4 tribal ceremonies and festivities , which k take place at certain periods . One of the latter , which is of a char-actor rather quaint , took place a couple of months ago at the close of the girls ' ' uniago ' or period of initiation . During that period , which lasts for about a month , the girls , every age from childhood to full-grown womanhood being represented , live together in a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by old women , the wisest in the village , for the vicissitudes ? and the pleasures ? of life , and instructed as to the lines to be followed in their relations with the other sex . For several days before the time appointed for the disbandment of the young ladies , a couple of men , whose particular business it is , were busy in the forest , manufacturing , out of bark and grass , resemblances of lions , hippos , and crocodiles , hollow and sufficiently large to enable a man to crawl inside . These the men put on , like circus-clowns , on the evening of the last night , and , having reached in silence the house of initiation , began to imitate the movements of the animals which they impersonated , while the lion , in addition , produced with a large earthen vessel an admirable imitation of that animal 's voice . The older girls , who had been warned , pretended to be horribly frightened ; while the smaller ones were so in reality , and began to scream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut . After they had reached a certain distance , the grown-up girls explained to the younger ones that the whole thing was a joke , and then they all came back laughing , to examine the menagerie more closely . The purpose of the whole affair , so I was told , is to teach the children to beware of wild beasts when they happen to meet them . The show ends with dancing and pombe drinking for two days and two nights .
