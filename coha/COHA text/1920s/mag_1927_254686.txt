Adam , Biblical father of the human race , was called " that weakling , " and Mother Eve " an angel , " last week at Belfast , Ireland , by their suppositious descendant Viscountess Astor , famed " First Woman M. P. " tireless exhalter of women over men . <P> Said Lady Astor to the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Ireland , an appreciative audience : <P> " Eve may have been bad , but she was an angel compared to that weakling Adam ! Eve was the first protester . She protested because she did n't want to live in a fool 's paradise which seemed good enough to Adam . Eve wanted knowledge and wisdom . Adam came out rather badly in that story . "
