Melvill , a crack shot , a fine horseman , a skilled combination player . <P> No. 2 . Major Geoffrey Phipps-Hornby ; like all the British players , a hard rider and an accurate shot . Two years ago , seriously ill with diabetes , he went to India to recuperate .

Atkinson , substitute No. 1 and No. 2 or 3 , respectively .
