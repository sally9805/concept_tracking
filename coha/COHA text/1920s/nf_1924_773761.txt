txt // be employed to denote the body-politic , or aggregate of citizens or subjects of a given State ; and the term Nation will be used to designate a group of individuals which may be regarded as unified by race , language , culture or common interests or aspirations , but which may or may not be so politically united as to constitute a People . In other words , when the word People is employed the factor of political unity is implied . When the term Nation is used , the unifying sentimental or psychological factor is implied . When it has not been feasible to adhere strictly to this usage care is taken to have the thought shown by the context . However it may be well at once to point out two important respects in which it has been necessary frankly to abandon the usage of the terms that have been indicated . In International Relations , the terms State and Nation are used synonymously to designate the entities or persons which possess the rights and rest under the obligations which International Law creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a growing tendency to employ the term " Nationals " to include not only those who are deemed citizens in a narrow constitutional sense of the word , but also those who , though not so recognized , are deemed to owe their primary allegiance to the State in question , and , as such , entitled to its protection in international matters . Thus , in the United States , Indians and the natives of unincorporated Territories have been held not to be citizens of the United States within a narrow constitutional sense of the term , but are , nevertheless , held to be its " Nationals . " Nation Defined . Returning now to the non-juristic concept of Nation , it is to be pointed out that when it is said that the influences of race , custom , language and history create a Nation , it is meant that from these sources springs the feeling or sentiment that binds to THE // gether a community of people and constitutes from them a single unit . Each of these factors invites the forma-tion of a Nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element is the feeling which is the result of one or more of these factors . Thus , as says Renan : " A Nation is a spiritual principle , resulting from the profound com-plications of history ; a spiritual family , not a group de-termined by the configuration of the soil . . . . A Nation is , then , a great solidarity constituted by the sentiment of the sacrifices that have been made , and by those which the people are disposed to make . It supposes a past ; it is , however , summed up in the present by a tangible fact : the consent , the clearly expressed desire of continuing the common life . The existence of the Nation is ( if the meta-phor is permissible ) a continued Plebiscitum , as the existence of the individual is a perpetual affirmation of life . " 1 According to Mill : " a portion of mankind may be said to constitute a nationality if they are united among them-selves by common sympathies which do not exist between them and others ? which make them cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to be under the same government , and desire that it should be government by themselves or a portion of themselves exclusively . " 2 The tendency of course is , as indicated in Mill 's defini-tion , for Nations to constitute themselves as individual States , and this demand for political unity constitutes the surest index to the existence of a national feeling . Hence , most publicists see in the national State the most perfect type of political development thus far attained . The advancing enlightenment of the masses has been instrumental in creating the true feeling of nationality , // that is to say , a demand for unity based upon some other ground than mere coercive political control ; and the last hundred years has seen the enormous influence that this principle has had in reforming the political map of Europe . At the same time it is not too much to hope that this same spirit of enlightenment that has given rise to a demand for a re-demarcation of political boundaries will , in turn , as civilization continues to advance , make this demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first the enlightenment of the masses creates in them a consciousness of their own individuality and solidarity , and thus a national feeling , as the culture of the people increases , their sympathies may become more cosmopolitan , and their appreciation of the true unity of all humanity more real . Ethnic , linguistic and even political unity may thus exercise comparatively less and less influence as Nations find themselves drawn into a higher and more intellectual union . At the same time , also , economic interests tend more and more to cross national and political boundaries , and thus to unite with increasing closeness the material interests of different Peoples . It may thus be entirely possible that the spirit of nationality at present so active in politics will prove to be a phase of civilization rather than a permanent product ; and that while the realization of a true World-State may never be possible , we may yet look forward to a growth of internationality that will largely deprive the feeling of nationality of its present force . CHAPTER VII TERRITORY AND PEOPLE AS CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politi-cal scientists the existence of a State implies the exercise by it of authority over a definite portion of the earth 's area . Thus the German jurist Seydel says : " A State comes into existence whenever a number of persons who have taken possession of a part of the Earth 's surface unite themselves together under a higher will . " 1 So also Bluntschli declares a State to be " the politically organized national person ( Volkperson ) of a definite territory . " 2 In like manner Rivier says : " A State is an independent community organized in a permanent man-ner in a definite territory . " 3 And a definition sub-stantially similar to this is found in the treatises of al-most all writers on international law . Some writers , among whom the present author was formerly included , incline to the view that a State may conceivably exist without a territory of its own , and , therefore , assert that the foregoing and similar definitions which included territory as an essential element of the State are incorrect . The author is now convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State is not , in some aspects of its exercise , exclusively terri-torial in character , the existence of sovereignty itself , and 63 // then without any territories upon which they could exercise their rights of sovereignty , were nevertheless States . Of such a view it may be said that , while a possible one , and of value in so far as it emphasizes the personal element in the conception of sovereignty , it is inadequate as an analysis of present conditions of fact . In the world as we now know it , all , or substantially all , of the land surface is claimed by one State or another as its own territory over which it asserts exclusive political jurisdiction . This being so , no opportunity is presented for the existence of an independent politically organized people which has no land area within which to exercise its sovereignty . Wherever such a hypothetical landless body politic might be ? unless it remained aboard ship upon the high seas ? its members would be subject to the legal jurisdiction of the State within whose borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sovereign body . As for the status of the Serbians and Montenegrins during the Great War , when their territories were in hostile military possession , it may be said that , regarded from their own legal point of view , the military governments of the Central Powers had no more than a de facto character . In other words , that , though for the time being dispossessed of them , their legal claim to these territories persisted . This point will appear more clearly in the chapter in which the distinction between government de facto and governments de jure will be discussed . In result , then , it becomes necessary that territory be regarded as an essential constituent element of a State , and must therefore appear in its definition . By some writers the jurisdiction which a State exercises over its territory is spoken of as a special right of sovereignty , and distinguished from the authority which it exercises over its citizens or subjects . This , however , is not // a satisfactory view since it tends to regard sovereignty as an aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will later appear , is not an accurate one . As Malberg says : " La territorialite n'est pas une partie speciale du contenu de la puissance etatique , mais uniquement une condition et une qualite de cette puissance. " 4 As one of the products of revolutionary thought , French writers and statesmen developed a special doctrine of the State 's territory according to which a sort of sacred or transcendental character was ascribed to it , and from that ascription the deduction drawn that , as regarded the French State at least , the territory claimed by it as its own was so interwoven with or bound up in its own life , that no portion of it might rightfully , under any circum-stances , be withdrawn from under its sovereignty . By article 1 , title 2 , of the Constitution of 1791 it was de-clared that " Le royaume est un et indivisible " ; and the same declaration in substance was declared by the repub-lican constitutions of 1792 , of 1793 , of the year III , of the year VIII , and that of 1848 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of December 16 , 1792 , de-clared that whoever should propose or attempt to break the unity of the French Republic or to detach from it any of its integral parts in order to unite them to the terri-tory of a foreign power , should be punished by death.5 And a similar decree was passed on April 13 , 1793. ? // It would seem from these declarations that the doctrine was asserted not merely that territory was a constituent and essential element in the life of the French State , but that that life was so bound up in the exact national ter-ritory which existed at the time the declarations were made , a mortal wound would be inflicted upon the State should any portion of its territory be taken from it , whether forcibly or otherwise . It will be remembered that Thiers , at the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 , arguing in the courts of the neutral nations that they should aid France in resisting the cession of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany , urged that this principle of the in-herent inviolability of French soil should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " My opinion certainly is the transfer of territory and inhabitants by mere force calls for the reprobation of Europe , and that Europe is entitled to utter it , and can utter it with good effect . " Nevertheless , as reported by Morley , Gladstone " could not understand how the French protests turned more upon the inviolability of French soil , than on the at-tachment of the people of Alsace and North Lorraine to their country . The abstract principle he thought pecu-liarily awkward in a nation that had made recent annexa-tions of her own . " 7 To the writer , except upon mystical or transcendental grounds , it is difficult to follow the argument of the French writers or statesmen who have advanced the fore-going argument as to the inviolability of a State 's terri-tory . That the life of a State , regarded juristically or from any other point of view , is dependent upon the maintenance of its authority over a specific extent of ter-ritory which may not be altered , at least by way of diminution , has been repeatedly disproved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical or theoretical // reason why the juristic proposition that a territory of some extent is essential to the existence of a State should imply the enjoyment by the State of sovereign authority over a territory of specific and unalterable boundaries . Upon the contrary it may be said that the juristic conception of the State places no limits , maximal or minimal , upon the extent of its territory . The nature and extent of the jurisdiction which a State claims the right to exercise over the territory claimed as its own will be discussed in a later chapter.8 The Citizen Body of the State . In the same sense in which its territory is to be deemed an integral and consti-tutive element of a State , its citizens , subjects , or na-tionals are to be so regarded . It is of course clearly im-possible to conceive of a State as existing when there are no persons upon whom its authority is to be enforced , or by whom it is to be formulated and declared . And yet it is necessary to distinguish the abstract juristic concept or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its citi-zens . As has been already several times emphasized , the State juristically viewed is but a political personality , an abstract idea , which the jurist , for his own convenience of thought , forms of the national or substantive State which requires for its existence a territory and body-politic . Thus , while it is necessary that there should be a terri-tory and a citizen body in order that there may exist an object to which the juristic conception of statehood may attach or be applied , this abstract idea is not to be con-fused with the concrete State composed of its territory and citizens , any more than the qualities of a thing are to be identified with the thing itself . As in the case of territory so with regard to the number of persons included within a politically organized group , // the juristic conception would seem to impose upon the State no maximum or minimum which can not be over-stepped.9 Citizenship . Allegiance , as its etymology implies , is the name for the tie which binds the citizen to his State ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To use feudal phraseology , the State is the political person to whom liege fealty is due . Nominally , accord-ing to the English law of today , English subjects owe their allegiance to the English monarch . They are ad fidem regis . Essentially , however , their allegiance is due to the English State viewed as a person , and the Crown is but the outward symbol and representative of that ab-stract political personality . Thus , analytically and juris-tically viewed , citizenship imports a personal relationship of the subject to his State . Sovereignty , as will later ap-pear , being essentially the legally supreme power of will-ing , it lies wholly within the discretion of a State , or of those who direct its policies , to determine the persons over whom it will extend its authority . In a legal , consti-tutional sense , therefore , the citizens or subjects ( the terms are juristically interchangeable ) 10 of a State are those persons wherever they may be , and whatever their nationality , over whom authority has been asserted by those departments of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in very many cases , States claim and enforce their authority over individuals who owe allegiance to other sovereignties . For example , this is done whenever control is exercised by a State over aliens temporarily residing or travelling , or permanently // domiciled within its territory , or where naturalization is granted to citizens of other States which do not recognize the right of expatriation . Souverainete Nationale . French publicists , since the Revolution , have developed a doctrine known as Souverainete Nationale , according to which the entire citizen body of the French State is viewed as , in itself , the political entity or person in which the right to rule inheres . The French Nation or People is thus confused , if not identified , with the French State , instead of being regarded as but one of its constituent elements . In a later chapter dealing with the location of sovereignty in the State we shall have occasion to consider in how far this doctrine of Souverainete Nationale is of significance simply within the special field of French constitutional law . CHAPTER VIII SOVEREIGNTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to use the term " sovereignty . " In this chapter the signification of this term will be morel specifically considered . Starting with that juristic conception of the State which views it as the sole source of positive law ? a conception which will , in turn , receive particular consideration in the chapter dealing with the nature of Law ? sovereignty is the name given to the supreme will of the State which finds expression in legally binding commands . As thus conceived , sovereignty is an abstract term . It implies the conception of the State as a volitional entity or political person , and designates that faculty which this political person possesses of determining , by its fiat , what are to be the legal rights and legal duties which it will recognize and , if necessary , enforce ; what persons it will consider subject to its authority ; and over what territory it will claim exclusive jurisdiction . It is , of course , to be understood that when we speak of the State as willing this or that , and describe laws as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is but a juristic mode of speaking . The State , not being a person in a biological sense , can not possess or exercise a will of its own in the sense that a human individual is able to do . The substance of what is actually willed is determined by those individual persons who have control of the government and these , of course , are 71 // more or less influenced in their determination by the wishes of the people generally . Juristically viewed , then , though regarded as expression of the will of the State , laws , in their substantive provisions , declare the will of human individuals . Sovereignty a Unity . Viewed as a quality or faculty of Statehood , and as connoting legal omnipotence rather than physical power , sovereignty is , by its very nature , a unity . It is the name ascribed to the will of a legally supreme political person . It is the plenary faculty which that entity is assumed to possess to express its will in the form of commands legally binding upon all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to any matters which it may select . As thus conceived it is clear that sovereignty is not regarded as a bundle or aggregate of jurisdictional powers . In other words , it can not be summed up by adding together such legal powers as those of taxation , of eminent domain , of police authority , etc . These powers are sometimes spoken of as peculiarly sovereign in character , that is , as inherent in the very nature of sovereignty . This characterization , however , is correct only in the sense that , as a practical proposition , it is difficult to conceive of a State which does not need constantly to exercise them . But , strictly speaking , all legal or jurisdictional powers involve the exercise of sovereignty inasmuch as they find their ultimate source in the sovereign will of the State . Legislative , Executive and Judicial Functions . It is not proper , therefore , to view the sovereignty of the State as composed of a number of functions so generically distinct from one another that , in their exercise , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true that there is a very real distinction between the creation of law , its interpretation , and its enforcement , and , for reasons of expediency , and especially in // order to minimize the possibility of a tyrannical use of political power by those to whom its exercise is entrusted , it may be desirable to create and maintain a complexus of governmental organs , and , so far as possible , to vest lawmaking , law-interpreting , and law-enforcing in different hands , yet it is practically impossible to push this socalled principle of the " separation of powers " to its extreme limit ; and , even as a theoretical proposition , it is found that many kinds of State action partake of the qualities of two or more of these functions , and can not by any process of analysis be reduced to simpler terms . Certainly , at any rate , no State , however elaborate its constitutional jurisprudence , has been able to devise or operate a form of government under which legislative , executive , and judicial powers have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested in different hands . However , the fact remains that there is a distinction between law-making , law-interpreting and law-enforcing , and that , to some extent , it is possible to vest the exercise of these functions in different governmental organs . But the important point to the political theorist is that this does not imply that sovereignty is fascicular in character . It remains a unity , although the realization of its commands involves a process in which judicial and executive as well as legislative characteristics are involved . In other words , whatever the governmental authority that is exercised , whether legislative , executive or judicial in character , sovereignty of the State is manifested . As to this we may quote with full approval the statement of Malberg : " I1 n'y a pas , dans 1'etat trois pouvoirs , mais bien une puissance unique , qui est sa puissance de domination . Cette puissance se manifeste sous des formes multiples : son exercice passe par des phases diverses , initiative , // deliberation , decision , execution ; les divers modes d'activite qu'elle comporte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au fond , tous ces modes , formes ou phases , concourent it une fin unique : assurer clans 1etat la suprematie d'une volonte dominants , laquelle ne peut titre qu'une volonte unique et indivisible . Le mot meme de nomination exclut la possibilite d'une pluralite de pouvoirs proprement dits : car si la puissance d'etat se divisait en plusieurs pouvoirs juxtaposes et egaux , aucun d'eux ne pourrait posseder le caractere dominateur , et , par suite , la puissance totale do nt ils sont les elements constitutifs et partiels , demeurerait elle-meme depourvue de ce caractere. " 1 The Exercise of Sovereignty May Be Delegated . It has already been seen that the exercise of sovereignty is conceived of as delegated by a State to the various organs which , collectively , constitute the Government . For practical political reasons which can be easily appreciated , it is desirable that the public policies of a State should be formulated and executed by governmental agencies of its own creation and which are not subject to the control of other States . There is , however , nothing in the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from entrusting the exercise of certain powers to the governmental agencies of another State . Theoretically , indeed , a sovereign State may go to any extent in the delegation of the exercise of its powers to the governmental agencies of other States , those governmental agencies thus becoming quoad hoc parts of the governmental machinery of the State whose sovereignty is exercised . At the same time these agencies do not cease to be instrumentalities for the expression of the will of the State by which they were originally created . ' Contribution a la theorie generate de l'etat , vol . II , p. 24 . The chapter of Malberg 's work from which this paragraph is taken presents an acute analysis of Montesquieu 's doctrine of the separation of powers . By this delegation the agent State is authorized to express the will of the delegating State , and the legal hypothesis is that this State possesses the legal competence again to draw to itself the exercise , through organs of its own creation , of the powers it has granted . Thus , States may concede to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right of control of so slight and so negative a character as to make its exercise a rare and improbable occurrence ; yet , so long as such right of control is recognized to exist , and the autonomy of the colonies is conceded to be founded upon a grant and continuing consent of the mother countries the sovereignty of those mother countries over them is complete and they are to be considered as possessing only , administrative autonomy and not political independence . Again , as will be more fully discussed in a later chapter , in the so-called Confederate or Composite State , the cooperating States may yield to the central Government the exercise of almost all of their powers of Government and yet retain their several sovereignties . Or , on the other hand , a State may , without parting with its sovereignty or lessening its territorial application , yield to the governing organs of particular areas such an amplitude of powers as to create of them bodies-politic endowed with almost all of the characteristics of independent States . In all States , indeed , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain autonomous powers of local self-government be granted to particular districts . The Determination of the Existence of Sovereignty . In all those cases in which , owing to the manner in which the governmental powers have been distributed , there is doubt as to the political entity or person in which the sovereignty rests , the test to be applied is the question as to which political entity or person , in the last instance , X76 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS Of PUBLIC LAW has the legal power to determine its own competency as well as that of others . For the essential criterion of the sovereign State is that it is supreme , not only as giving the ultimate validity to all law , but as itself determining the scope of its own powers , and itself deciding what in-terests shall be subject to its regulation . It sets to itself its own rights and establishes the limits of its own author-ity . As Jellinek puts it in his Gesetz and Verordnung : " The rights and duties of individuals receive their potency and authority from grounds set forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own rights and duties in itself . " 2 Or , as he expresses it in another work : " Obligation through its own will is the legal character-istic of the State . " 3 Sovereignty Can not Be Limited . Sovereignty as a State attribute is not only a unity , but one that , by its very nature and definition , connotes absolute legal authority . To place a legal limit upon it is , therefore , to destroy it . As Austin says in his Province of Jurisprudence De-termined : " Supreme power limited by positive law is a flat contradiction of terms . " And he continues : " Nor would a political society escape from legal despotism , al-though the power of the sovereign were bound by legal restraints . The power of the superior sovereign impos-ing the restraints , as the power of some other sovereign superior , would still be absolutely free from the fetters of positive law . For , unless the imagined restraints were ultimately imposed by a sovereign not in a state of sub-jection to a higher or superior sovereign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern the imagined community , which is impossible and absurd . " If , then , we have the case in which one State is recog-nized to have the legal authority to place a legal restraint // of any sort upon the legal will of another political body , that political body can not be said to possess sovereignty . A Sovereign State Can not Impair Its Own Sovereignty . Equally true is it that no State is able to impair its own sovereignty . Since , ex hypothesi , its own sovereignty is the source of all law for itself , it can not by a law ( except formally ) limit itself , for , by an exercise of the same will that creates the limitation , the limitation may be re-moved . To this point we shall later return . The State not a Subject of Legal Rights and Obligations . There is some dispute among jurists as to whether or not a sovereign State may be regarded as itself a " subject " of legal rights and duties.4 If , however , the viewpoint of the analytical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no difficulty in asserting the negative upon this point . The State , being regarded as itself the source of a law , can not be regarded as bound by the obligations which that law creates ; and , even as to rights , the ascription of them to the State is meaningless , since their continuance as well as their crea-tion , their character and their content , are wholly subject to the State 's will . In other words , ' there would seem to be no more value in attaching legal rights and duties to the sovereign State than there is in predicating the at-tributes of goodness and justice of a Divine Being who is regarded as Himself the creator , by His own unrestrained will , of all distinctions between goodness and badness . It scarcely need be said that this denial of legal rights and duties has reference only to the State and not to its various governmental organs or officials . These , as has been earlier pointed out , have their competences de-termined by law , and , therefore , they must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the // possessors of legal rights and as the subjects of legal obligations . This will presently be made more evident when the nature of constitutional law and of constitutional government is discussed . Hobbes in whose writings are to be found so many of the fundamental principles which Bentham and Austin were later to develop into a system of Analytical Jurisprudence , fails to make this distinction between the monarch or other instruments of government and the sovereign political entity or person , the State , but , in the following passage the logic of his argument as to the impropriety of ascribing legal rights and duties to the person or organ that creates them can not be successfully attacked . He says : " The sovereign of a commonwealth , be it an assembly or one man , is not subject to the civil law . For , having power to make and repeal laws , he may when he pleaseth , free himself from that subjection , by repealing those laws that trouble him and making of new ; and consequently he was free before . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will : nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himself , because he that can bind , can release ; and therefore he that is bound to himself only , is not bound . " ' 5 Austin who subjected juristic ideas and terminology to meticulous , although not always successful , analysis , first , after Hobbes , emphasized the doctrine that a sovereign law-making power can not be held to be itself a subject of legal rights any more than it can of legal obligations . To hold that the sovereign State can be legally obligated , he declares , would be contrary to the very definition of sovereignty . Thus , in Lecture VI of his Province of Jurisprudence Determined , 6 he says : " Every legal right is the creature of positive law ; and ? Leviathan , chap . XXVI , sec. 2 . Edition of 1875 , New York , ed. by Campbell , p. 166. // it answers to a relative duty imposed by that positive law , and incumbent on a person or persons other than the per-son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal right , there are therefore , three several parties : namely , a party bearing the right ; a party burdened with the rela-tive duty ; and a sovereign government setting the law through which the right and the duty are respectively conferred and imposed . A sovereign government can not acquire rights through laws set by itself to its own sub-jects . A man is no more able to confer a right on himself than he is able to impose on himself a law or duty . Con-sequently , if a sovereign government had legal rights against its own subjects , those rights would be the crea-tures of positive law set to its own subjects by a third person or body , who must , therefore , be sovereign over them . The community would therefore be subject to two different sovereigns , which is contrary to the definition of sovereignty . " Therefore , says Austin , when a sovereign State appears in a court as a plaintiff , or , with its own consent , as a de-fendant , the rights and duties that appear to attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , analogous to , but not identical in character with the rights and duties predicated of non-sovereign persons or bodies . Markby in his Elements of Law 7 takes practically the same position as Austin upon this point . So , also , does Sheldon Amos in his Science of Law . ' Holland in his Elements of Jurdisprudence 9 , and Gray in his Nature and Sources of Law 10 , take emphatically the position that legal rights and duties may be predi-cated of the sovereign State , but it is clear that , in doing so , insofar as they assert more than Austin admits under // therefore of a State , is dependent upon the claim upon the part of the State to a territory of its own . In a later chapter we shall have occasion to show in considerable detail that , in many respects , the political jurisdiction of a State is personal as well as territorial in character ; in other words , that sovereignty is recognized by the public law of all constitutionally developed States to imply the legal right upon the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or occurrences taking place outside of its own territorial limits . This legal significance , however , is one which the State can not enforce outside its own territorial limits except with the express or implied consent of the other States within whose limits the enforcement is to take place . It is , then , not an adequate description of sovereignty to speak of it simply as territorial in character , unless , from the context , it is plain that reference is had to the enforcement , and not to the assertion , of the State 's legal right of control . There is , indeed , some justification for holding that , the essential quality of sovereignty consisting in a predicated right to issue commands legally binding upon individuals , the enforcement of these commands is a secondary matter which may or may not be actually effected , and which , in fact , in no State is always effected ; and that , therefore , it is possible to conceive of a State without any territory of its own . Those who argue thus say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who regard themselves as politically united under a ruler or Government which they regard as entitled to determine for them their legal rights and obligations , a State may be fairly said to exist . For example , they would say that during the period , while the World War was in progress , when the territories of Serbia and Montenegro were wholly occupied by Central Powers , these Kingdoms , though // the term quasi or analogical legal rights , they confuse the ideas of State and Government , and , as a result , apply to the former entity an amenability to law that can prop-erly be imputed only to the latter . Thus Gray says : " It is for the interest of the State that robbery should be pre-vented . It protects this interest by issuing a command and imposing a duty ; it creates for itself a legal right . . . . The State has an indefinite power to create legal rights for itself , but the only legal rights which the State has at any moment are those interests which are then protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ac-cordance with which the judicial organs of the State are then acting . " Here there is a double error . In the first place there is the incorrect assumption that interests can be predicated of the State as distinguished from its citizens . The truth is that it is because of the citizen 's interest that robbery is sought to be prevented . As an abstract legal entity , considered apart from its own citizens , a State can not possibly have substantive interests to be protected or ad-vanced . Secondly , the law as it exists at any given time operates not as a limitation upon the State , or to endow it with legal rights or powers , but solely , in these re-spects , upon individuals whether as private citizens or as public officials . A similar failure to distinguish between the State as the creator of law , and as operating through law , but as not itself subject to the control of law , and its govern-mental agencies which have only such legal rights and obligations as are given to them by law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Zane to the state-ment made by Mr. Justice Holmes in his opinion in the case of Kawananakoa v. Polyblank 1 that " there can be // no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.12 Mr. Zane starts out with the erroneous impression that Mr. Justice Holmes had asserted the principle " that no law can create a legal right against the government . " If this be true , says Zane , " we may as well apologize to Germany at once for daring to question the divine right of government to override every law , contritely confess nostram culpam , nostram , . maximam culpam , and start anew on a truly Hegelian basis ; for the divine right of government is simply the divine right of Kings writ large . " In a historically learned essay Zane then traces from Roman times the doctrine iterated and reiterated by moralists , jurists , and courts that public officials should be , and , under constitu-tional systems of government , are subject to the opera-tions of law . It must , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present treatise , as well as from the long line of decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States from which no departure was suggested in the Kawananakoa case , that Justice Holmes did not intend to assert , or the court to hold , that no law could create a legal right against the Government of a sovereign State . Mr. Zane 's argument thus exhibited an ignoratio elenchi . Sovereignty Not Impaired by International Obligations . The legal omnipotence of the sovereign State , constitu-tionally viewed , is not impaired by the obligations as-sumed by it in its agreements with other sovereign Pow-ers , or by the existence of constitutional legal provisions , written or unwritten . The nature of the limitations im-posed upon States by treaties or by International Law will be discussed in a later chapter of this volume in which the nature of the State as internationally viewed is examined . Here it is sufficient to state the result of // the inquiry there pursued , namely , that , in sensu strictiore , these limitations are not legal in the sense in which that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to determine the nature of the limitations placed upon state action by Constitutional Laws , it will be necessary to examine with some degree of care the essential character of these laws . Laws Do Not Constitute a Limitation upon the State 's Sovereignty . It has been seen that when sovereignty is predicated of a State , there is asserted the doctrine that the State is the creator of all the laws in accordance with which its own activities are conducted . In other words , it sets to itself , that is , to its own governmental organs and officials their legal powers . This legally unlimited competency ? Kompetenz Kompetenz , as the Germans term it ? distinguishes the sovereign State from all other human associations of a political or juristic character . The State is supreme , not only as giving the ultimate validity to all the laws which are to fix the rights and obligations of those over whom it chooses to claim jurisdiction , but as itself determining the scope of the legal powers of its own governmental agencies and the manner of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain of the legal and political liberties of the individual is simply that field of interests which the State has willed shall be protected from violation , whether by private persons or by public officials . From the possible control of the State itself , however , from the very source of all law ? there can be no possible legal guarantee of immunity , except in the formal sense that , from its very nature , a State must express and execute its will in the form of law . Private individuals and those who are in possession of public authority may , indeed , as a matter of fact , invade the rights of the individual and destroy those interests which existing law defines and establishes and which the // State professes to defend , but such action , because illegal , can not be said to be the act of the State itself , even if committed by its highest governmental officials . Constitutional Law Defined . The distinction between constitutional and ordinary statute laws can not as a general proposition be based upon the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason that some States , Great Britain for example , do not possess written constitutions . Equally unsatisfactory are the criteria that the consti-tutional laws may not be amended or repealed in the same manner as other laws , or that they are applied by the courts in preference to other laws which may be in conflict with them . This is shown not only by the fact that in such countries as England there is no formal distinction , either as to creation or repeal , between constitutional and other laws , but also by the fact that , in most of those countries which have adopted written constitutions , the courts do not assume the authority to refuse recognition to statutory enactments which contravene the provisions of those constitutions . And , in truth , in some of those constitutions , the formal provision which is made for constitutional amendments makes the process only slightly more difficult than that of ordinary legislation . In coun-tries like the United States which possess written instru-ments of government it is of course possible to limit the application of the term constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This gives to these laws a very distinct character for the reason that the amendment of these instruments is made more formal and more difficult than is the process of ordinary legisla-tion , and because , in the United States at least , the doc-trine is fully established that , in case of conflict , other laws or attempts at legislation must yield to the provi-sions of these written constitutions . But , when this deft84 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW nition of constitutional law is accepted , the distinction as to substantive content between constitutional and other laws is wholly abandoned , since American constitutions contain many provisions which have no direct relation to the form and powers of government but concern mat-ters of private law . In order , then , to have a definition of Constitutional Law which is susceptible of general application and which also has the merit of going to the substantive content rather than to the form of the laws that are defined , we are led to denominate as constitutional those laws which relate directly to the form of government that is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the imposition of limitations upon , the several governmental organs and f unctionaries.13 Constitutional Law Limits the Government But Not the State . Constitutional provisions do not purport to con-trol the State but only its Government . These laws are the creation of the State itself for its own purposes , and the limitations upon public action which they impose are not designed for , and do not operate as , a limitation upon the State that comes from a source outside itself and thus restrains the free exercise of its legally omnipotent will . This is so even in those cases in which , as in the United States , the courts hold null and void all laws the provisions of which are inconsistent with constitutional mandates , and where the amendment or repeal of these mandates is made extremely difficult . The limitation // upon the exercise of the State 's sovereignty is still a purely formal one . It is common to speak of constitutional laws as of a legal force higher than that of ordinary legal statutes . Not only is this not true of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , it is not a correct way in which to describe the distinc-tion.14 Because our constitutions set limits to the legal // powers of our legislatures , laws enacted by them tran-scending such limits are not recognized by the courts as valid . But , when so doing , the courts do not thereby declare that there has been a conflict between two laws of differing degrees of legal force , the lower having to give way to the higher . That which they do is simply to say that the statutes in question , though enacted in the usual form , are not laws at all , and never were laws , because their subject matter did not lie within the legal competence of the legislature enacting them . As Cooley says in his Principles of Constitutional Law , " Such enact-ment is in strictness no law , because it establishes no rule ; it is merely a futile attempt to establish a law . " Strictly speaking , then , the term " unconstitutional law " is a contradictio in abjecto : if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not unconstitutional . Carrying this point still further , it will be seen that this distinction as to degree of validity is not to be drawn between laws and ordinance or decrees . As ordinarily un-derstood an ordinance signifies a command of limited application , not necessarily permanent , and usually issued // as an administrative direction by a department of gov-ernment . If legally issued , however , that is , if within the legal competence of the authority uttering it , these ordi-nances are of equal juristic validity with the more general and formal mandates of the State . In another work 15 the author has discussed this point and from that treatise the following two paragraphs are taken : " There are not and can not be degrees of legal validity . Any given rule of conduct or definition of a right either is or is not law . When , therefore , we describe any par-ticular measure as an unconstitutional law , and there-fore , of course void , we are in fact , strictly speaking , guilty of a contradiction of terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ; or , if it is law , it can not be unconstitutional . Thus , when any particular so-called law is declared unconstitutional by a competent court of last resort , the measure in question is not vetoed ' or ' annulled , ' but simply declared never to have been law at all , never to have been , in fact , anything more than a futile attempt at legislation on the part of the legisla-ture enacting it . This is a very important point , for did the decision of the court operate as a veto the effect would be simply to hold that the law should cease to be valid from and after the time such decision was rendered , whereas , in fact , the effect is to declare that the law never having had any legal force , no legal rights or liabili-ties can be founded upon it . In Norton v. Shelby County.16 Mr. Justice Field said : An unconstitutional act is not a law , it confers no rights , it imposes no duties , it affords no protection , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as inoperative as though it had never been passed . " // " In declaring unconstitutional , and therefore void , the enactment of a legislative body , it has sometimes been argued that a court defeats the will of the people as whose law-making organ and mouthpiece the legislature acts . In truth , however , what is done is this : The people , acting solemnly and deliberately in their sov-ereign capacity , declare that certain matters shall be determined in a certain way , and these matters , because of their great and fundamental importance , they reduce to definite written form , and declare that they shall not be changed except in a particular manner . In addition to this , they go on to say , in substance , that , so decided is their will , and so maturely formed their judgment , upon these matters , any act of their own representatives in legislature inconsistent therewith , is not to be taken as expressing their deliberate will . Therefore , when the courts declare void legislative acts inconsistent with constitutional provisions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they have previously solemnly declared it . Thus , In exercising this high office the judges claim no judicial supremacy ; they are only the administrators of the public will . If an act of the legis-lature is held void , it is not because the judges have any control over the legislative power , but because the act is forbidden by the Constitution , and because the will of the people , which is therein declared , is paramount to that of their representatives expressed in any law . ' " 17 Correct as is the statement of this doctrine , its applica-tion with respect to acts of those holding office under an unconstitutional statute is not without practical as well as logical difficulties . Some courts have held that , there being no de jure office , there can be no de facto officer . Other courts , however , have held that , until a law pur-porting to create an office has been declared unconstitu- // tional by the courts , one holding an office has a color of title thereto , and is , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by direct proceedings as , for example , in the nature of quo warranto . In other words , though not legally an officer , because of the constitutionality of the law creating the office , or provid-ing the conditions under which he has qualified , the acts of such a person may not be questioned in collateral proceedings by persons affected by them.17a As is well known , John Austin refused to recognize that constitutional law ( designating by that term the rules that define the organization of the State , and the extent and manner of exercise of governmental powers ) has a " positive " legal character . That which gives to them force , he said , is public opinion regarding their expedi-ency and morality , in fine , that they belong to the class of moral rather than of legal rules . In so holding he was clearly wrong , and his error is traceable to his failure to distinguish between the State and its Government . He was controlled by the view that constitutional laws pur-port to control the State itself , which , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the one accepted in the present treatise , is a logical impos-sibility . He did not appreciate that constitutional laws operate only as a limitation upon the organs of Govern-ment.lS The fact is , that Austin 's conception of the nature of constitutional law was largely determined by the par-ticular conditions under which the powers of his own government were exercised . As is well known , a very // large portion of the rules according to which the English Government is , and was at Austin 's time , habitually ex-ercised , are truly to be considered , as he maintains , not laws at all but customary rules of morality and political expediency . They are , as Dicey says , " conventions , un-derstandings , habits or practices , which , though they may regulate the conduct of the several members of the sovereign power of the Ministry , or of other officials , are not in reality laws at all since they are not enforced by the courts . " 19 Examples of these conventions are the maxims that the King must consent to any bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Lords may not originate a money bill ; that the Ministers must resign office when they cease to command the confi-dence of the House of Commons . That which distinguishes these conventions or customs of the constitution from positive law is not so much their lack of actual binding power ( for their actual obligatory force is great enough to make the open contravention of many of them as unlikely as if they were actually estab-lished in a fundamental instrument of government ) , but the fact that , should they be violated , no greater consequence would be entailed upon the officers so doing than popular blame and unpopularity . There would be no legal action that could be sustained either to enforce the recognition of such violated maxims or to punish their contravention.20 Insofar as Austin limited the exclu-sion of constitutional regulations from the domain of law to principles of this class he was logically correct . But he did more than this . He erroneously applied // the exclusion without reservation to all provisions that purport to regulate the manner of exercise of the State 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposition that all law , whether public or private , is , while it remains in being , a substantive limitation upon the Government of a State , but not upon the State itself . Through the laws are fixed the rights and duties of individuals , and the manner in which such rights are to be exercised and en-forced . As such , they are all of the same validity , and are as binding upon the Government as are constitutional provisions . A public official will be as readily checked by the courts for the exercise of a power that contra-venes an ordinary statute as for an action that trans-gresses a rule of constitutional law . All law thus con-stitutes a limitation upon the State 's legal power in the sense that , only by a change in that law can the rights which it protects be legally infringed , and this change in the law , whether by way of amendment or annulment , if it is to be the act of the State , must be made in the manner which has been provided for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change must be made in the same manner and through the same agencies as the original law itself was created . As a logical proposition , an irrepealable or unalterable law is an impossibility , for the same legislative competency which is adequate to enact must be conceded the power to repeal . But what , then , it may be asked , is the value of formal provisions of laws with reference to the manner in which they may be amended or repealed ? None whatever , legally speak-ing , when we have to deal with a law-making body of unlimited competence , such , for example , as the English Parliament , and this is proved by the fact that upon more than one occasion that body has repealed laws which , when enacted , were declared irrepealable . If , in92 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW stead of being declared irrepealable , the law embraces a clause providing that it may be repealed only in a certain manner , here , too , this limitation may be disregarded by the law-making body if it be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to deal with the enactments of a law-making body whose legislative powers are themselves defined by law , a different proposition is , of course , presented . That a State is legally supreme and the source of all the law which it enforces , and that , therefore , it is logically impossible to conceive of the State as legally unable to change or abolish any existing law , applies to constitutional as well as to private law , for constitutional law is , equally with private law , the creation of the State . In other words , unless we would sacrifice the sovereignty of the State , we must hold that no constitution or constitutional provision , however formally adopted and declared unalterable , can , in legal contemplation , be held to be such . Thus , in the case of written constitutions , of which there have been a considerable number , which have had no amending clauses , it must be held either that they may be amended by ordinary legislative act , or that they may be changed by the same authority which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments of government from former autocratic rulers , it is but natural that , in the absence of specific provisions for amendment , they should have been held subject to alteration only with the consent of the electorate or by the organ of government , if there is any such , which is deemed to represent the governed . This , for example , has been the doctrine held by Italian jurists regarding the instrument which serves as the constitution of the Kingdom of Italy . But , from the legal point of view , it would , perhaps , have been more logical , if not // more politic , to have held that the amending power is in the Crown , inasmuch as the constitution owed its establishment as law to a royal fiat . It is not uncommon to hear the written constitutions of Europe which have been promulgated by monarchs in response to overwhelming popular demand spoken of as compacts between the governed and their respective rulers . This is juristically incorrect . However expressed , and whatever may have been the actual conditions that necessitated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally speaking , a contractual character . Their legal life was breathed into them by the ruler , who , before their establishment , was the sole depository of law-making power , and who , indeed , after their promulgation , retains the legal right to speak the will of the State according to his own judgment except as otherwise provided in the constitution , and , even as to them , only so long as he may see fit to maintain in force the constitution which he had granted . This , of course , is only the juristic point of view , and has no reference to the fact that , as a practical political matter , he would not be able to disregard , in this respect , the wishes of his subjects , or that , if he could , it would be a breach of a moral obligation for him to do so . Legal theory asserts that so long as an autocratically conceded or " octroyed " constitution remains in force the monarch is legally bound by its provisions . If he wishes to depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal form , he must first change the constitution so as to give to himself the desired legal authority . It has thus been commonly argued that if , in the constitution which he has granted , a formerly autocratic monarch has declared that it shall be changed only in a special manner , that is , only when a certain procedure has been gone through with , as for example , the acceptance of the pro94 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW posed changes by the elected representatives of the people , he can not legally change the constitution except when such specified conditions have been met . It is , however , somewhat questionable whether this conclusion is a necessary result of juristic logic . It might be maintained that , inasmuch as the constitution in question derived its sole claim to legality from the will of the monarch , that monarch would have the legal right to alter or amend its provisions , including its clauses providing for its amendment , in virtue of that same legal competency which empowered him to establish the constitution in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by constitutional conventions or the votes of electorates or other organs for expressing the popular will ; namely , that , irrespective of their provisions , they may be amended by an exercise of that same constitutive power which originally stamped upon them the quality of law . To substantially this conclusion American constitutional jurists have been frequently , though not uniformly , led . This deduction has been so closely related to , as to be practically a corollary of , the characteristic doctrine of American constitutional jurisprudence that the Constitutional Convention is , par excellence , the organ through which the citizen body of a State exercises that sovereign power which it is assumed to possess by virtue of the very fact that it is a body-politic . Hence , it has been held by American courts that , when a written constitution contains no provisions for its own amendment , it may nevertheless be amended or replaced by a new instrument drafted by a Constitutional Convention and either promulgated by that body or submitted by it to the vote of the electorate . In some instances this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have specified other // modes of amendment ; and , still more extreme , in in-stances in which the constitutions have declared that the modes of amendment specified in them should be the only modes in which they may be amended or replaced by new instruments of Government . Hoar , in his Consti-tutional Convention : Their Nature , Power and Limita-tions , Chapter XIII , asserts broadly this constituent power of conventions called by the legislatures without authority given by the existing constitution , and criticizes the narrower view of Dodd in his Revision and Amend-ment of State Constitutions . Hoar says : " The whole people in their sovereign capacity , acting through the forms of law at a regular election , may do what they will with their own frame of government , even though that frame of government does not expressly permit such action , and even though the frame of government at-tempts to prohibit such action . " 21 To the substantiation of the statement as a principle that has been applied in American constitutional practice , he denotes Chapter IV of his work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Thus we come back to the fact that all conventions are valid if called by the people speaking through the electorate at a regular election . This is true , regardless of whether the constitution attempts to pro-hibit or authorize them , or is merely silent on the subject . Their validity rests not upon constitutional provisions , nor upon legislative act , but upon the fundamental sov-ereignty of the people themselves . " 22 As to this point this much may be said : the position has been quite consistently taken that constitutional amendments or new constitutions adopted in modes not provided for by the existing constitutions can not be rec96 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW ognized as legally valid unless they have received the formal approval of the old existing government . Thus , in the case of the State of Rhode Island , the old constitution of which contained no provision for its own amendment , the President of the United States refused to recognize as de jure a government established under a new constitution which , without the approval of the old government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adult male citizens of that State.23 But when , somewhat later , a new constitution was adopted in accordance with provisions which the old government laid down and approved , it was , and has since been , held a valid instrument both by the people of the State and by the National Government of the United States . Whether or not a constitutional amendment has been constitutionally adopted , and is therefore to be recognized as law , is a matter for the courts to determine unless the constitutions in question have made specific provision for this determination by some other body . When , however , the question is as to the de jure character of an entirely new constitution , or of an amendment so radically changing the structure of the old government as practically to create a new one , the matter is deemed a political one , the determination of which by what are called the political departments of the government being held by courts as conclusive upon themselves . And it need scarcely be said that the courts established under a given constitution will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , it is only upon the basis of its validity that the courts themselves could claim any rights whatever of jurisdiction . 7B The Supreme Court of the United States , in the case of Luther v. Borden , 7 Wallace , p. 1 , held itself concluded by this executive decision , the question as to when a government is to be deemed to be de jure in character being declared to be a political one , and , as such , to be decided by the political department of the government . The same doctrine has been repeatedly declared by the courts of the States of the Union . See the authorities cited by Corpus Juris , vol . XII , p. 880 , note 35. // Corpus Juris , summing up the general dcctrine of American jurisprudence upon the matter of adoption and amendment of written constitutions , says : " Whether or not a new constitution has been adopted is a question to be decided by the political departments of the govern-ment . But whether an amendment to the existing con-stitution has been duly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the constitution , so as to become a part thereof , is a question for the courts to de-termine , except where the matter has been committed by the constitution to a special tribunal with power to make a conclusive determination , as where the governor is vested with the sole right and duty of ascertaining and declaring the result , in which case the courts have no jurisdiction to revise his decision . " 24 The State Though not Limited by , Must Operate Through , Law . In only one sense can it be said that the sovereign State , as conceived of by the Analytical Jurist , is controlled by Law . Being itself , when viewed as a legally omnicompetent person , wholly a product of juristic reason , it is , by its very nature , a legal entity , that is , one that necessarily operates exclusively through legal processes . Law , in other words , constitutes the medium or space , if a dimensional term may for the pur-pose of illustration be employed , in which it lives and moves and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , be illegal ; and no illegal act can be an act of a State . Its governmental agents may act illegally , but , when they do , they do not represent the State . Thus , // though the State , as juristically conceived , is not , and can not be controlled by law , and , therefore , can not logically be regarded as the subject of legal rights and duties , it at all times is compelled , by its very juristic nature , to operate through law . The fact that the State is above , if not outside of law , does not , of course , prevent it from permitting itself , as to particular matters , to be treated as though it were a private or non-sovereign person , and as such , to hold itself amenable to law . This is a practice which practically all modern States follow to some extent , and the principles of public law that relate to this practice will later be considered when the subject of the jurisdiction of the State is discussed.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which describes as sovereign that organ of government which plays the more important or decisive part in the determination of what the State shall will , that is , which controls in fact the policies of the State . Thus , in an absolute monarchy , or in a limited monarchy in which the Crown retains a dominant influence in government , the King is often spoken of as the possessor of sovereignty . So , similarly , in States organized upon the democratic or representative basis , the people are spoken of as constituting collectively the entity in which the sovereignty inheres . This is an inaccurate statement , whatever may be the extent of the political authority of the absolute monarch , of the constitutional ruler , or of the citizen body . It is , indeed , of very great importance to determine in the case of any constitutional system whether all public powers shall be deemed to find their legal origin in an assumed plenitudo potestatis of a monarch , or in the body-politic from which , by specific delegation , the competences of other governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to be " Post , chap XXIV. // repeated , in all cases , the sovereignty inheres in , and is possessed by , that political entity or person which we term the State . A government or any of its organs never does more than exercise sovereignty in behalf of , and as an agency of , the State . As a mere matter of titular distinction it is common to speak of the ruler of a monarchically organized State as the Sovereign of the State . This usage , which prevails especially in international relations , has no relation to the constitutional powers or status of the King , Czar , Emperor , Sultan , or whatever he may be termed . The ruler whose actual influence and authority is insignifi-cant is as universally termed the Sovereign in this hon-orific sense as is the most powerful autocratic Prince . Sovereignty of Law . The phrase " the Law is Sover-eign , " which is not infrequently met with , has no other juristic significance than that the State is able to speak its legal will only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions that , at the given time , are in existence . Stated negatively , it means that every governmental official must be able to justify every ex-ercise of public power upon his part by a reference to a constitutional or other valid statutory delegation to him of legal authority . Purely personal and arbitrary dis-cretionary power is thus excluded . The doctrine is thus that stated by Mr. Justice Matthews , when he says that " the law is the definition and limitation of power . " 26 The same principle is enounced in the Massachusetts Constitution when it declares that the government is to be one of laws and not of men . Popular Sovereignty . The terms then , " sovereignty of the people , " " popular sovereignty , " and " national sov-ereignty , " as will be more fully explained , can not ac-curately be held to mean that , under an established gov-ernment , the sovereignty remains in the people . It may // mean , however , that the constitutional jurisprudence of the State to which it is applied is predicated upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be regarded as the source whence , by delegation , all other public powers are derived , but that , upon the contrary , all legal authority finds its original source in the whole citizen body or in an electorate representing the governed . CHAPTER IX THE SITUS AND MODES OF EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY : CONSTITUTIONAL AND PURE JURISTIC THEORY DIS-TINGUISHED As has been earlier suggested , a clear line of distinction divides a doctrine of constitutional law from one of pure jurisprudential theory . The first is special in its application and relates to a particular system of constitutional law ; the second relates to the very nature of public law , and is , therefore , general in character , and applies to the State , whatever may be its particular type of governmental organization or its special system of constitutional jurisprudence . Sovereignty we have found to be an essential attribute of the State . Its nature and qualities are determined by pure political or jurisprudential theory . Its modes of exercise in any given State are , however , determined by the system of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . The determination in each particular case of these modes is , therefore , a matter of constitutional law , the discussion of which might be omitted in such a treatise as the present one . However , it seems proper that a certain amount of space should be devoted to this matter if only for the purpose of making more plain the distinction between sovereignty as a purely juristic concept , and the same term when employed to indicate the ultimate source whence the ethical right of a given government to exist is drawn , or the actual forces which , in fact , determine the policies of that government , or , finally , the organ or 101 // organs which , under the given system of constitutional law , may be said to have the final or supreme legal right to express the will of the State . Constitutional Theory of Pure Monarchy . As a matter of pure political or juristic theory , the State remains the same whatever may be its form of government or constitutional jurisprudence . That jurisprudence may start with the premise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Crown . Deductions from this premise are : that by the will of the ruling monarch all other organs of government have been created and continue to exist ; that from that will such legal powers as they possess have been derived ; and that by that will they may , at any time , be curtailed or wholly withdrawn ; and that , if a written constitution exists , its legal force is dependent upon that will . These are the constitu-tional doctrines upon which a system of pure monarchy is founded . ' // Secondly , the constitutional jurisprudence of a State may take as its logical basis or starting point , the principle that certain organs of government other than the Crown , such as elected legislative chambers or an elec-torate having referenda . legislative powers , shall divide with the Crown , upon a basis of full legal or constitutional equality , the various or certain powers of government , that is , in such a way that these several organs may act independently of each other as to the specific powers constitutionally vested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operate with one another . In such a constitutional system it is obvious that all its provisions derive their legal force from some single source . If these provisions are to be found in a written Constitution or fundamental instrument of government , the original and continuing fountain of all legality , corre-sponding to the legal autocracy of the absolute monarch , // is the particular organ or complexus of organs of gov-ernment , or electorate or determinate group of individuals acting ad hoc as an organ of government , which is rec-ognized to have the legal right to change the terms of the written Constitution , which Constitution , therefore , however it may have been originally adopted , is to be regarded as continuing to have force of law only because the constitutional organ or complexus of organs so wills it . This is the constitutional situation which now exists in practically all of the States of the world . A third constitutional or governmental possibility is that exhibited by Great Britain which has a King , and does not possess a formal written Constitution or instrument of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated and yet definite system of govern-ment and a body of constitutional principles according // to which that plenitude of constitutional power , which , in a pure monarchy , is vested in the Crown , is vested in the Crown and a Parliament , the members of one House of which sit , for the most part , by hereditary right , and the members of the other House by selection by an elec-torate which has been broadened from time to time until now it includes nearly all adult citizens.2 Consent of the Governed . A fourth constitutional doe-trine , often asserted , but never actually put into force , and , in fact , practically impossible of operation , is that which declares that all governmental powers are validated by the consent of all the governed . Regarded as an ethical proposition , this assertion will be examined in the // volume on Ethical Political Philosophy , referred to in the preface . Regarded as a legal or constitutional principle it is easy enough to show that it has never been adopted by any State , and that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The statement of the American Declaration of Inde-pendence that " Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed , " considered as an abso-lute one that applies to all States is , of course , an ethical proposition , the validity of which is not of concern to the analytical jurist . If it be advanced as a constitutional principle the term " governed " becomes synonymous with the People or citizen body of the State , and it then be-comes necessary to ask if this aggregate of individuals is to be viewed distributively , or collectively as a corporate unit . If in former sense , all valid legal or political au-thority is at once rendered impossible and the State de-stroyed . By this doctrine , as Bluntschli says , " the State is resolved into its atoms , and supreme power ascribed to the unorganized mass or to the majority of these individuals . This extreme radical opinion contradicts the very essence of the State , which is the basis of sov-ereignty. " 3 If the latter view is taken , and the governed regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be regarded as the constituent members of this composite political body , and the modes in which it can make its legal will authentically manifest . As regards this matter of membership , but two alter-natives are possible : either the People , thus viewed as the sole source of positive law , as the legally supreme organs of the Government , must be conceived of as in-cluding every citizen or subject of the State , children and infants of the tenderest years as well as adults , the wholly uneducated as well as the educated , the feebleSITUS // minded as well as those of sane intelligence , and each of them given a right to participate in determining the laws and policies of the State , ? a result so obviously absurd , from a practical point of view , that no politically organized body of individuals has ever attempted it ; or the other alternative accepted that the " active citizens , " to use Rousseau 's phrase , are to be limited to certain classes of individuals who are to participate directly in the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electorate either for the purpose of selecting representatives who will act for them , or , by way of the initiative to propose laws , or the referendum to pass final judgment upon laws which their elected representatives draft , or which they themselves have initiated . If , then , we take this second view as to the constitutional meaning of " consent of the governed , " the way is at once opened to all forms of government , except possibly that of autocratic or pure monarchy as described above . If the step is once taken of conceding that a portion of the governed , less than the whole , may arrogate to itself the legal right to act for the whole People and to claim obedience to its commands upon the part of those citizens who are excluded from this " active citizenship , " there is no logical limit to the process . Such a small portion of the whole citizen body may claim the right to act for the whole that , instead of being what is ordinarily known as democratic or popular in character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even assume a monarchic form with extensive discretionary powers vested in the ruler , provided only that it is understood that this monarch rules not by reason of any inherent personal right of his own but as an agent of the body of active citizens , small or large as that body may chance to be . Furthermore , this electorate , in every constitutionally organized State , can act legally // only according to predetermined forms , in conventions or assemblies , or by registering their will at prescribed times and in the modes already fixed by law . And , even when so acting , it is necessary that there should be definite laws as to what proportion of the votes cast shall be deemed to express the will of the entire electorate , and , as such , to bind the entire citizen body . It is plain , then , that , as a constitutional proposition , the doctrine of popular sovereignty , or sovereignty of the people , carries with it little more than the negation of the doctrine that supports absolute or pure monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not do even this , that , in other words , the autocratic monarch can declare himself to be the agent or representative of his entire people in exactly , and in as logical , a sense as that in which a portion of the entire People arrogates to itself the legal right to speak and act for the whole . The value , then , of constitutional government is not that it places Sovereignty in the hands of the people , but that it prescribes definite ways in which this sovereign power shall be exercised by the State . The value of popular government is that it provides the means through which the wishes of the people may be known and felt , and that thus the conduct of a State may be brought into conformity thereto . Constitutional government thus protects the citizen from arbitrary action on the part of the State : popular government secures to him the probability that his wishes and interests will be considered . Public Opinion . Sharply distinguishable from the doctrine of popular sovereignty according to which , as an ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessarily based upon the consent of the governed , as well as from the constitutional doctrine that the legal powers of all the organs of government are to be traced back , in the last resort , to grants from an elecSITUS // torate or other constituent body which is assumed to rep-resent and speak for the entire body of citizens , is the doctrine , or rather the assertion of fact , that , in all States , whether autocratically or democratically organized , the actual dominance of power lies with the governed , and that , therefore , their will may not be opposed , except to a limited extent , by those who occupy the official or legal seats of power . The fact is , as must be apparent to all , that there are limits to the endurance of any people , however patient , unenlightened , and submissive , and , that , when op-pressed beyond this limit , they will prefer the evils of open resistance to those of submission ; and , if this op-pression be carried so far as to excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , the ruling powers will be overthrown . These are facts that are necessarily recognized by every ruler . As Hume well says , " As force is always on the side of the governed , the governors have nothing to support them but opinion . It is therefore on opinion only that government is founded , and this maxim extends to the most despotic military governments as well as to the most free and most popular . " 4 In fact , Austin himself expressly and repeatedly af-firms that the legal sovereign is actually controlled in the exercise of power by the wishes of the community . In this very definition he says , " If a determinate human superior not in a habit of obedience to a like superior receive habitual obedience , " etc. , the word " habitual " thus indi-cating the possibility of the sovereign will being opposed . Again he says , " If perfect or complete independence be of the essence of sovereign power , there is not in fact the human power to which it will apply . Every govern-ment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW ence to the commands of other governments . And every government defers habitually to the opinions and sentiments of its sovereign subjects . " 5 And , also , " To an indefinite though limited extent , the monarch is superior to the governed , his power being commonly sufficient to secure compliance with his will . But the governed , collectively or in mass , are also the superior of the monarch , who is checked in the abuse of his might by fear of exciting their anger and of arousing to active resistance the might which slumbers in the multitude . " 6 It is plain that , when dealing with this popular ultimately conditioning force , which exists in all political societies , we are not dealing with a legal factor . It may be , as Lieber describes it , the sense and sentiment of the community which gives meaning to the letter and life to the law , and without which the written law is a mere husk , ' but it is , nevertheless , not a legal force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a catalogue of influences . " 8 As has been already several times said , sovereignty as a legal force or element can be exercised only through the organs of the constitutionally established Government.9 Those doctrinaires who emphasize this factor of " popular sovereignty , " and make it include a right of revolution , are not always careful to explain that this " right , " so far as it is anything more than mere might , is ethical rather than legal in character . By the mere fact of a Lectures on Jurisprudence , ed. 1867 , vol . I , p. 242 . The Province of Jurisprudence Determined , p. 14 ( ed. 1861 ) . See also , idem , note to p. 192 , and p. 272 ; Professor Dewey , in the Political Science Quarterly for March , 1894 , shows the tendency of Maine and others to treat Austin 's system as if it ignored this ultimate conditioning power of popular approval .

However proper their con-duct from a moral standpoint , from a legal standpoint they are then acting not as a body politic , but as a mob . They have , in fact , expressly repudiated State agencies . This , then , can not be an act of Sovereignty , for Sover-eignty , as expressly defined and conceded by all , is of the State and is possessed by a political community , and s not by an uncivic aggregate of men . Until a people be-come politically organized there is no Sovereignty . " // If it be necessary to make this point still more conclusive , the circumstance may be pointed out that in all cases the actions of States are , as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other States , and thus their independence is practically governed by influences identical in character with those exercised by the public opinion of their own citizens . The legal , or rather non-legal , nature of both are the same . No greater validity can be predicated of the one than of the other , yet even Lieber and Jameson would not hold that Sovereignty rests , not with the individual States , but in a Community of States . " Political " Sovereignty . Professor Ritchie , in an article upon this subject " distinguishes between this power of the people exercised by public opinion , which he terms " the ultimate , political Sovereignty , " and the highest political power of the State as exercised through its legally established organs , which he designates as " legal Sovereignty . " It is undoubtedly correct thus to make this distinction , but , to the writer , it seems unfortunate that the same term , " Sovereignty , " should be applied to two forces so radically different , even though distinguishing adjectives be prefixed . Is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " General Will , " and to limit the word " Sovereignty " to its purely legal application ? In thus distinguishing between Sovereignty and General Will or Public Opinion , between legal absolutism tinguished ; how Sovereignty , as necessarily inhering in a social body only as a political body , and exercised as such , can likewise be discovered in mere opinion or in " irregular " acts for the achievement of social as well as political changes ; what valuable distinction there is between revolutionary.and legal conduct ? a distinction emphasized throughout the work ; ? these are questions that Judge Jameson does not attempt to answer . ( Cf. his article entitled " National Sovereignty , " in the Pol . Sci . Quar. , vol . V , p. 193 . ) ' On the Conception of Sovereignty , " Annals of the Amer . Acad. of Pol . and Soc . Science , January , 1891. // of the State and its powers as absolutely limited by political exigencies , we are , in fact , but stating a result that correlates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of custom to law.12 That is to say , we shall deny to the people a capacity for legislation except through State organs . It is the essential office of representative or public government to make an ap-proximately correct formulation of Public Opinion , and to secure political action in conformity thereto , 13 but this is not to place the exercise of Sovereignty in the un ; organized community . In conclusion , then , of this point , it may be said that , though legally absolute , Sovereignty is to be considered in reference to the institutions , the character of the people governed , and other objective conditions . While force is and always must be an incident of Sovereignty , the highest ideal of statesmanship is to render the actual exercise of such force as seldom necessary as possible , and the extent to which this aim is attained will depend largely upon the degree in which State action corresponds with the desires of Public Opinion or the General Will . As T. H. Green says , " If once the coercive power which must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it in its relation to the people governed , this must indicate one of two things ; either that the general interest in the maintenance of equal rights has lost its hold upon the people , or that the Sov-ereignty no longer adequately fulfils the function of main-taining such rights , and thus has lost the support de-rived from the general sense of interest in supporting it // . . . It is certain that when the idea of coercive force is that predominantly associated with the law-imposing or law-enforcing power , either a disruption of the State or a change in the sources of Sovereignty must sooner or later take place . " 14 Souverainete Nationale . A constitutional doctrine superficially resembling and often confused with that of " popular sovereignty " is that known as " Souverainete Nationale , " which the French , since the time of the Revolution , have , except for a single exception ? the Charter of 1814 ? adopted as the fundamental principle of their constitutional jurisprudence . Article 3 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation . No body , no individual may exercise any authority which has not expressly emanated from it . " The Constitution of 1791 declared that " The sovereignty is one , indivisible , inalienable and imprescriptible . It belongs to the Nation . " A similar declaration occurred in the Constitution of the Year III . It was impliedly affirmed by plebiscites under the Constitution of the Year VIII , and the Empire . It was again explicitly declared in the Constitutions of 1848 and 1852 , in the Resolution of February 17 , 1871 , and in the Preamble of the Constitutional Law of August 31 , 1871 . This principle , as Malberg so well shows in his analysis of it15 is best interpreted in the light of the historical conditions under which it was first enunciated , and , as thus interpreted , is shown to have the negative purpose of denying , once for all , the fundamental constitutional principle of the former French Monarchy that all con " Green , Philosophical Works , vol . II , p. 410 . To many persons it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present conditions in the United States with reference to the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution . ' Contribution a la Theorie Generale de l'Etat , vol . II , pp. 167-187. // stitutional power found its source in the King , and that he had an inherent divine or patrimonial right of rulership . As opposed to this royal doctrine , the doctrine of Souverainete Nationale asserts that no person has such a personal or inherent right to exercise political power . Such a right can only be a delegated or constitutional one ? one that has been created and sanctioned by the French Nation . This constitutional premise that the ultimate constituent power is vested in the Nation has meant that sovereignty , as a legal concept , resides , not distributively in each of the individuals that compose the Nation , but in the citizen body as an individual and indivisible whole . In the Constitution of 1791 sovereignty is expressly declared to be one and indivisible . It is thus clear that , from the beginning , the doctrine was essentially different from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of 1791 , made no attempt to provide a legislative body the members of which would be elected by a direct and universal suffrage . And later constitutions , without abandoning the doctrine of Souverainete Nationale , limited the suffrage to holders of landed property , and , in the Charter of 1830 , established even a monarchy ? of course a constitutionally limited one . In result , then , according to this doctrine , the Nation is declared to have that exclusive right to exercise the sovereign or constitutional powers , which , prior to 1789 , had been claimed by the King . It might at first be thought that this investment of sovereignty in the Nation , conceived of as an indivisible political whole or corporate unit , amounts to practically the same thing as the ascription of sovereignty to the State , as assumed in the present treatise . The two doctrines are not , however , the same . Souverainete Na116 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW tionale is a special constitutional doctrine . It permits , indeed , the establishment and maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that they and their several organs and officials shall be deemed to have only such legal powers of rulership as they may have obtained by way of delegation by the Nation , that is , by those constituent bodies that are assumed to speak for the Nation . The doctrine therefore renders constitutionally impossible all forms of government which are founded upon , or which involve , the recognition of a right of rulership inhering as a personal underived right , in particular persons or groups of individuals . The doctrine of the sovereignty of the State , upon the other hand , as developed in the present treatise , is one of pure political or juristic theory . It is wholly indifferent to , and , therefore , is compatible with , any form of government , whether autocratic or democratic.la In other words , the concepts of Nation ( or People ) and the State are not to be confused . The vesting of sovereignty in the Nation or people is , as has been said , a constitutional doctrine and not one of pure political theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sovereignty in the Body-Politic . As is well known , in his definitions of law and of the State Austin emphasized the idea that a law is a command that emanates from a ie Malberg is , therefore , not quite correct when , contrasting the constitutional doctrine of the pure monarchy with that of Souverainete Nationale , he says : " Dans le premier , 1'Etat ne personnifie que lui meme , la nation n'etant que 1'un des facteurs do nt la reunion a pour effet de former l'etablissement public Etat ; dans le second , la nation n'est pas seulement Pun des elements qui concourcnt a constituer 1'Etat , mais else s'identifie avec lui et it ne personnifie qu'elle .

" ( I p. cit. , II , p. 189. // determinate source , and that , as a prerequisite to the existence of a State , there must exist a determinate individual or a determinate group of individuals who pos-sess the sovereign right of declaring law , and who , in addition , are able to secure , if not the uniform , at the least the habitual , obedience to this law upon the part of the bulk of the community to which it is addressed . Austin says : " If a determinate human superior , not in a habit of obedience to a like superior , receive habitual , obedience from the bulk of a given society , that deter-minate superior is sovereign in that society , and that society ( including the superior ) is a society political and independent . " 17 This determinate human superior , Austin elsewhere says , may be a single individual defi-nitely marked out , or a body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite ascertain-able quality or characteristic . It is especially to be observed in this definition that Austin vests the sovereignty , not in the State , but in this determinate individual or body of individuals . There is no question as to this for he goes on to say : " It is only through an ellipsis that the society is termed independent . The part truly independent ( independent , that is to say , of a determinate human superior ) is not the society , but the sovereign portion of that society . " And again he says : " An independent political society is divisible into two portions , namely , the portion of its members which is sovereign and superior , and the portion of its members which is merely subject . . . When the sov-ereign portion consists of a single member , the supreme government is properly termed a monarchy , or the sov-ereign is properly termed a monarch . " At this point the doctrines developed in the present treatise depart from those of Austin . Austin , it is clear , // does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between pure political theory and constitutional doctrine , which the author has continued to emphasize . It may be granted to Austin that a command or positive law must issue from a determinate source , but , in political theory , that determinate source is always the particular State that is under examination . Legislative Power . Bearing in mind what has gone before , it is evident that the search for the determinate sovereign governmental organ of a State is an inquiry that has to be separately performed for each State , and the answer obtained from the special system of constitutional jurisprudence which such State possesses . This much , however , may be declared in general terms : that sovereignty being the omnicompetent legal will of the State , its operation is especially manifested when the policies of the State are declared . These policies are for the most part embodied in the laws of the State , but may also , as , for example , in international affairs , be decided upon or made known either in the form of treaties or by other executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , every act of every organ of government , if justified by existing constitutional and statute law , is an act of sovereignty . In a more special sense , however , the State 's sovereignty is manifested in the enactment of the laws which determine what the various organs of government shall be legally competent to do . There is thus some force in the statement of Locke that , " In all cases whilst the Government subsists the legislative is the supreme power . For what can give laws to another must needs be superior to him , and since the legislative is no otherwise legislative of the society but by the right it has to make laws for all parts , and every member of the society prescribing rules to their actions , and giving power of execution where they are transgressed , the legislative must needs be supreme , and all other powers in any // members of parts of the society derived from and subor-dinate to it . " 18 It has already been pointed out that the electorate of a State is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are instances in which the electorate acts as a legislative organ . This happens whenever there exists a constitutional provision or practice according to which law may be created by a referendum or other pie-biscital method . When so called upon for its vote , the. , electorate is to be considered ad hoc a legislative body . Of course , in those cases where a vote of the people is had merely for the purpose of discovering what the public sentiment is upon a given proposal , and without the power of such a vote itself to give a legal validity or non-validity to the proposal , we do not have the elec-torate exercising the law-making power . Understanding now by Sovereignty a power which is capable of exercise only through existing governmental agencies , it necessarily follows that this supreme power is exhibited whenever the will of the State is expressed . In fact , it is almost correct to say that the sovereign will is the State , that the State exists only as a supreme con-trolling will , and that its life is only displayed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to mere executive agents . These executive agents , while acting as such , have no will of their own , and are but implements for the performance of that will which gives to them a political and legal authority . This , then , locates the exercise of Sovereignty in the law-making bodies . By whomsoever , or whatsoever body , therefore , the will of the State is expressed , and the law created , there we have Sovereignty exercised . If we dis-tinguish between executive , judicial and legislative de-partments of the State , it is in this last-named depart-ment that the exercise of Sovereignty rests . The only // point that we must remember is that the term " legislative " must not be so narrowly construed as to limit its application to those bodies by which formal statutory enactments are made . Insofar as the chief executive of the State has the ordinance power , he may express the sovereign will and therefore exercise Sovereignty . As we know , this power was , in former times , very extensive in England , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire constitutional history of England is in fact but little more than a record of the manner in which this royal power of law-making has been curtailed , and the legislative power of Parliament taken its place . Again , constitutional conventions , insofar as they have the direct power of creating constitutional law , exercise this sovereign power . Finally , insofar as courts are the organs of the State for the creation of law , they express the will of the State and hence exercise Sovereignty . It may be said that courts are able to legislate only by the acquiescence of the legislative body which may negative by statute the principles which they have declared ; and hence that they act but as agents of the legislature proper . In the same way , it may also be said that , in many States , the ordinary legislature exercises its powers only by right of constitutional law , and therefore that it , in turn , but voices the will of those who establish this fundamental law . This is certainly true , and therefore , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sense , that that organ possesses the final sovereign power which creates those laws that organize the Government , and distribute powers among its several governmental agents . In a measure we have already discussed this point in our consideration of the nature of constitutional provisions as compared with that of other forms of law . In a country like England , such a supreme body is the Parliament , but // in those countries where government rests upon written constitutions , it is the organs that have the legal right to - codify the terms of such instruments . By some jurists it is asserted that courts create law not merely by reason of the fact that they establish and apply rules that have previously had no legal ? or even custo-mary ? existence , but because in them lies the authority to determine the meaning to be given to the laws as cu-acted by the formal legislative organs of the gov-ernment . Thus Gray , after defining the law of a StatQ as " composed of the rules which the courts , that is the judicial organs of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duties , " 19 in a later sec-tion Y0 says : " The true view , as I submit , is that the Law is what the judges declare ; that statutes , precedents , the opinions of experts , customs , and morality are the sources of the Law ; that back of everything lie the opinions of the rul-ing spirits of the community ; who have the power to close any of the sources ; but that so long as they do not interfere , the judges , in establishing Law , have recourse to t these sources . " Earlier in his volume , Professor Gray had made his position upon this point still more emphatic in the fol-lowing words : " It has been sometimes said that the Law is composed of two parts , ? legislative law and judge-made law , but , in truth , all law is judge-made law . The shape in which a statute is imposed on the community as it guide for conduct is that statute as interpreted by the courts . The courts put life into the dead words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied that there is considerable force in // the foregoing views ; and to the extent that it is accepted it increases the part played by the courts as the legisla-tive or will-expressing organs of the State . But so long as the courts , in fact , make no claim of right and in fact exercise no right to construe statutes in a wholly arbi-trary manner , according to their own opinions as to the justice or expediency of the rules of conduct embodied in the enactments of the legislature , but limit their function to the interpretation or construction of the language of these statutes , the doctrine which denies a real lawmak-ing function to the legislature seems a forced one . In any case , however , the will that is declared and enforced is that of the Sovereign State . Austin 's Error . It might have been thought that Aus-tin , in his search for the determinate superior in a given politically organized society , would have been satisfied when he had found the supreme law-making organ of government . But this he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overstepped the bounds of the jurisprudence for the determination of the limits of which his lectures were denoted , and wandered confusedly in the realms of political or social forces . Thus , Austin located sovereignty in Great Britain in the Kings , Lords , and Commons . But by Commons he was not content to mean the lower branch of Parliament , but designated thereby the electors of the lower house . " Speaking accurately , " he says , " the members of the com-mons ' house are merely trustees for the body by which they are elected and appointed ; and consequently the Sovereignty always resides in the Kings and the peers , with the electoral body of the commons . " 22 Here , as // Professor Ritchie has pointed out , he no longer speaks as a lawyer . " For a lawyer qua lawyer a law is good law though it were passed by a Parliament which had abol-ished the Septennial Act and had gone on sitting as long as the Long Parliament , quite as much as if the law were passed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an overwhelming majority , had been re-turned expressly pledged to vote for this very law . With the wishes or feelings of the electors the lawyer as lawyer has nothing whatever to do , however much they may , affect him as a politician or as a reasonable man . " 23 To ' the same effect is the dictum of Professor Dicey , that nothing is more certain than that no English judge ever conceded , or under the present constitution can concede that Parliament is in any legal sense a trustee for the elec-tors : a dictum that is conclusively verified by the power of parliament , several times exercised , to lengthen its own existence without any reference to the voters by whom its members had been elected for a shorter period.24 // In like manner , in the case of the United States , Austin does not discover legal Sovereignty in the legislative bodies of the individual Commonwealths , or in the federal Congress , or in both combined . He sees the legal compe-tence of these bodies apparently limited by written consti-tutions , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these written instru-ments may be amended . " I believe , " says he , " that the Sovereignty of each of the States , and also of the larger State arising from the federal union , resides in the State 's government , not its ordinary legislature , but the body of its citizens which appoint its ordinary legislature , and which , the union apart , is properly sovereign therein . " 28 The same criticism is here valid that was applied to Austin 's location of Sovereignty in the English electorate . His doctrines are unsatisfactory , not only to the jurist , but to those who , when they speak of sovereignty , refer to the ultimate force of Public Opinion , for those who take this latter view make the electorate but an organ of the whole body of citizens , by whom it is influenced and in many ways controlled . Professor John Dewey makes also the criticism that this electorate is not even determinate . His argument is as follows : If the electorate be the sovereign , then each voter is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who prove to be in the minority ? " If we say he ( i.e. , one of the minority ) did share in Sovereignty be-cause he had a right to vote , we say Sovereignty may be exercised apart from the utterance of commands , indeed , even in opposing the fundamental command . But if we say that , since not participating in the expression of the // supreme command , he is not sovereign , the question arises by what right he voted at all . " 26 This reasoning of Professor Dewey is unsatisfactory . It is just as applicable to a legislative body as to a popu-lar gathering . What of the members of the minority in the English Parliament ? The fact is , that when Austin or any other writer refers to an electorate as exercising Sovereignty , he , or they , refer to such an electorate as a collective body of which each member possesses an in-divisible portion of the Sovereignty of the whole . That is , that the citizen shares in the Sovereignty not as an in-dividual but as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers say , per tout only , and not per my , as Professor Dewey would seem to think . Rousseau makes this distinction very plain by expressly distinguishing be-tween the " will of all " and the " General Will . " 27 The distinction between Sovereignty as a juristic conception and the ultimate conditioning power of popular opinion , was , however , one that was never reached by Rousseau , who completely identifies Sovereignty with the " General Will . " It is in consequence of this assumption , that , in searching for the manner in which this sovereign power may be legally exercised , he was forced to hold that " laws being but authentic acts of the General Will , the sover-eign can not act except when the People is assembled . " 28 And again , that " Sovereignty can not be represented for the same reason that it can not be alienated ; it consists essentially of the General Will , and the will can not be rep-resented ; it is the same or it is different ; there is no mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be its representatives , they are only its commissioners ; they can conclude nothing definitely . Any law which the people in // person has not ratified is null ; it is not a law . " 29 Thus the position is taken that all authority exercised other than by warrant of the general assembly of the people is illegal , and a government thus acting has only a de facto and not a de jure existence ? a position according to which there was not at the time of Rousseau 's writing , nor has there been since , a State in Europe in which rebellion would have been an illegal act . Comparing these views with those held by Hobbes and Locke , we find that , according to the former of these writers , a sovereign organ , be it a monarch or a popular assembly , is made practically identical with the sovereign State itself , and , as such , incapable of legal limitation . Thus , in all truthfulness , the absolute ruler might say that l'etat , c'est moi . The agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , the machine absorbs the power that moves it . Apart , however , from this confusion between State and Government Hobbes developed a substantially correct theory of law and Sover-eignty , though he needlessly based it upon an illogical fiction . Locke , though founding his system on the same fic-tional contract , came much nearer the comprehension of the true nature of government in his declaration of its limited delegated character , and the essentially represen-tative capacity , of all political agents . It would also seem that at times he perceived the distinction between the actual ultimate power of the people to condition political action , and the legal or sovereign action of the State . Thus he declares " the community may be said in this respect to be always the supreme power but not as considered under any form of government , because this power of the people can never take place till the // government be dissolved . " 30 But his preconceived ideas of natural rights and of sovereignty as resting upon a contract make him speak in general of this ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral right , or as a power founded upon mere might . For the same reason he does not always sufficiently recognize that the State may be so organized as to permit sovereign action greatly opposed to public will and to public in-terest , and yet strictly constitutional and legal . Thus , in considering what is to be done in case an executive , to whom has been entrusted the power of calling together the legislative branch , should refuse to exercise such power , to the detriment of the people , he describes such action as " contrary to the trust put in him that does so , " and as " a state of war with the people who have a right to reinstate their legislative in the exercise of their power . " 31 Here the theory of a contract between governed and governing again crops out . The juristic fact is , however , that governmental agents exercise a power delegated or granted to them by the State , and not one created by a joining of their wills with those of the subjects . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials are , in other words , agents of the State , not of the People . They have no legal relation to the People as such , and , therefore , there can be no breach of contract with them in whatever manner they may exercise their power . If they exceed their legal competence , or are in any way guilty of non-feasance or malfeasance of office , they are punishable only by the State . Therefore , any action of theirs , however oppressive , does not , as Locke would say , ipso facto deprive them of political power , and place them // in a state of war with their former subjects . Such action is not even illegal if within their competence , and is as fully valid as would be the most beneficent measure . If ultra vires , however , the action is of course illegal and not an act of the State , but of the official as a private individual , and one for which he is personally responsible . But such illegality extends only to the particular act itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of such official . Rousseau is thus perfectly correct in denying that a Government is established by a contract . CHAPTER X THE NATURE OF POSITIVE LAW THE ascription of Sovereignty to the State , and the definition of Sovereignty as legal omnicompetence have made it necessary to view the State as the sole source of law in a positive or strictly juristic sense . This is a proposition which many have found the most difficult to accept of all the assertions of analytical jurisprudence and it will therefore be necessary to consider it with some degree of care , and especially is this so because of the varying meanings which are commonly attached to the word " Law . " As opposed to the description of Law as the sequences of events in the physical universe ? sequences that occur without reference to and beyond the control of men 's wills ? the jurist uses the word as declaring a rule or principle for the governance of human action . Its characteristic in this sense is that it is capable of being expressed as a distinct proposition to rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As thus conceived , a law implies that he who issues it has , or claims to have some sort of legal authority over the persons whose actions are to be controlled ; that , in other words , as between him and them there is a relation of jural superiority and inferiority . Out of this relation also arises the idea of legal obligation upon the part of those to whom the commands are directed , and of legal right upon the part of those who will be beneficially interested in having these obligations fulfilled . Laws , as Austin says , are rules laid down for the guid-129 ance of intelligent beings by intelligent beings having authority over them . As thus defined , they include commands set by God to men , and those set by men to men . With the former , jurisprudence is not concerned . But , even with regard to the laws set by men to men , the analytical jurist is concerned only with those which are issued by men who claim a political superiority over those men whose actions are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spoken of as positive in character . Rules of conduct not in the form of commands from a superior to an inferior , Austin continues , are rules of morality , and , though often spoken of as laws , are not properly so-called , or at least , are not properly so-called if the term law be used in its sense of a command emanating from a determinate political source . Such are the socalled laws of honor or of fashion , and other rules of conduct supported by public opinion . These become " positive " rules , though still not positive laws , when they assume the form of commands from determinate human beings but not as based upon a claim of political superiority . They become positive laws , or laws properly so-called only when there is this relationship of political superiority and political inferiority . Thus , with reference to the recognized rules of conduct regulating the relations between States , Austin says : " These are not laws properly so-called . But one supreme government may doubtless command another to forbear from a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , though it is fashioned on law which is law improperly so-called , this command is a law in the proper sense of the term but not a positive ' law . Speaking precisely , the command is a rule of positive morality set by a determinate author . For , as no supreme government is in a state of subjection to another , the command , though fashioned on the law of nations , would not amount to a positive law . Nor does the government which gives the command act as the executor of a command proceeding from the uncertain body ? the collective family or aggregate of nations . That government may , however , act as the executor of a command proceeding from a definite number of sovereign States allied under a treaty . In that case there would be a command issuing from the allied States collectively , and enforced by the one government as their minister . This would be still a rule of positive morality and not positive law , because the government or State which is to be coerced would not ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to the allied governments collectively , or to the government which has for the occasion acted as their minister . " 1 Austin , as we have seen , classifies also constitutional laws as rules of positive morality rather than as positive laws properly so-called . His error in this respect has already been examined.2 We are thus prepared for the statement of Austin that : " Every positive law or every law simply and strictly so called , is set by a sovereign person , or a sovereign body of persons , to a member or members of the independent political society wherein that person or body is sovereign or supreme . " 3 In another place Austin somewhat expands the statement which we have quoted by saying that every positive law is set directly or circuitously by the sovereign , and , therefore , that laws may be declared by private persons in pursuance of legal rights . The foregoing are declarations of fact , and the question is whether they may be squared with other well known fartts and : ecneeia.11d with thn fart that the iurliiia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement of con-troversies coming before them , apply principles or rules of conduct which have not found previous explicit and definite statement as commands of the State of which these tribunals are the governmental agents . If , in a given State , one wishes to determine concretely what are the laws of that State , it is certainly correct to say that they are the rules or principles which the judicial tribunals of the State will apply in the cases adjudicated by them . Thus says Salmond : " Law consists of the rules recognized and acted on in courts of justice " 4 ; or , as Gray declares : " The Law of the State or of any organized body of men is composed of the rules which the courts , that is , the judicial organs of that body , lay down for the determination of legal rights and duties . " w It was of course obvious to Austin , as it has been to all those who have accepted his proposition that the State 's will is to be viewed as the creative source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conduct embodied in the decisions of courts have been , in consid-erable measure , the product of popular custom or of the practice of the courts themselves . Hence it has been contended by many that the Austinian doctrine is not in accordance with obvious and incontestable facts . In other words , it is argued that the large body of legal principles , commonly called customary law , which the courts apply and the State enforces , arises independently of State enactment . Especially has this criticism of the orthodox analytical jurist been advanced by writers of what is termed the Historical School of Jurisprudence , and by those who still cling to doctrines of Natural Law . The contention of Natural Law adherents that the State is not to be viewed as the sole creator of law , is sufTHE // ficiently disposed of by pointing out that , granting all that is claimed , the only result is to show that , as an ethical proposition , those in possession of political power should be guided by certain fundamental and absolute principles of justice and moral right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enforced by political power . The argument of the Historical School of Jurists requires , however , a more detailed examination . In England this school is headed by the name of Sir Henry Maine , and , upon the Continent by Savigny and Puchta . In general American writers are also of this school . " Positive Law , " says Savigny , " springs from that general spirit which animates all the members of the Nation , and the unity of the law is revealed necessarily to their consciences and is by no means the effect of chance . " 6 The growth of custom he compares to that of language , and continues : " Law which lives in the common consciousness of the people is not composed of abstract rules . It exists rather in the actual perception of a legal insti-tute in its organic connection , and the rule appears in its logical form so soon as the need for it is felt ; it is then singled out from this connection , and is translated in an artificial manner . " 7 In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently of the State . It is the creation of the national consciousness or spirit of a people and is evidenced by their customary habits . Even formal statutory enactments , according to this view , are able to secure recognition and enforcement only insofar as they conform in their provisions to the " Spirit " of the people . When , therefore , they are formally enunciated by the courts or legislatures , the function of the State is rather that of realizing and enforcing the law than of creating it . // While the above quotations from Savigny serve to show which objections to it are disposed of is , as I have so often what has undoubtedly been the dominant attitude of said before , that what the sovereign permits , he cornGerman jurists during the last century , certain of their mands . " The position which is taken , however , in number show a tendency to turn to a position more the present work is that there is more than a verbal truth similar to that of the analytical jurists of England . in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovEspecially is this apparent in Ihering 's Zweck im Recht , ereign ; and that when a customary rule is declared by a and Lasson 's System der Rechtsphilosophie. court of justice to be one which the State will enforce , In England , on the other hand , the high authority of such rule becomes specifically distinct from what it had the Austinian School has been considered as greatly before been . shaken by the historical method introduced into the study A characteristic American argument against the Ausof law by Sir Henry Maine . This writer is supposed to tinian view is that contained in the opening chapters of have pointed out that , throughout the greater portion of Wharton 's Commentaries on American Law . This author the world 's history , law was created otherwise than ac- writes as follows : " By whom were existing English cording to the Austinian theory , and , therefore , that , if statutes winnowed in the colonies of Massachusetts and his conception of the source of law be applicable at all , Pennsylvania , for instance , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly developed States . The fol- the temper and met the wants of the people , and to set lowing quotation from Maine sufficiently indicates his aside all others ? This was not done by the colonial asposition . Referring to an Indian despot , he says : " At semblies ; had such a process of radical revision been at first sight there could be no more perfect embodiment tempted by these assemblies it would have been promptly than Runjett Singh of sovereignty as conceived by vetoed by the king in Council . It was not done by the Austin . He was absolutely despotic . Except occasionally British Parliament , though the British Parliament ason his wild frontier he kept the most perfect order . He sumed to be the sole supreme legislature by whose laws could have commanded anything : the smallest disobedi- these colonies were controlled . It was done by popular ence to his commands would have been followed by death assent produced by national conscience and national or mutilation , and this was perfectly well known to the need . It is true that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt whether pendent sovereigns they passed laws by which the process once in all his life he issued a command which Austin of selection and rejection thus carried out was approved . would call a law He had all material of power But it was never pretended that the process of selection and he exercised it in various ways . But he never made and rejection derived its authority from such legislation . law . " 8 On the contrary , when the colonies became sovereigns , It is to be observed that Maine admits the verbal what their court said was , the law of the land , in this truth of Austin 's theory , for he adds : " I do not for a respect , was not imposed by the sovereign on the people , moment assert that the existence of such a state of but was adopted by the people and afterwards accepted by political society falsifies Austin 's theory . The maxim by the sovereign . ' The same may be said of the rulings of " Early History of Institutions , p.380. our courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law regulating Indian tribes . " s And again he says : " That custom makes the law and not law custom , is shown by the fact just noticed , that when a custom is recognized by the courts as existing , the recognition oper-ates retrospectively , the custom being regarded as law before it was judicially recognized . " to In considering now these criticisms that are made upon the Austinian position as to the nature of law , it is to be observed that much the greater part of these objections are in fact examples of ignoratio elenchi , the confusion arising , as Holland correctly points out , from the am-biguous sense in which the term " source of law " may be used.11 This expression may be used either to denote the mode in which , or the person through whom , have been formulated those rules which have acquired the force of law ; or , to denote the authority which gives them that force . Now , so far as it is used in the first sense , there is no denial made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , the source of law ; that is , that , through this medium , have arisen the principles of social conduct that have been subsequently embodied in law . Furthermore , it is not asserted that , as an actual fact , the exigencies of public life have not at all times demanded that the sovereign power should found the expression of its will upon these rules . What the analytical jurist does maintain is , that these customary rules do not become law in a strictly legal or positive sense , until they are ac-cepted by the political power . As Austin says , " There can be no law without a judicial sanction , and until cus-tom has been adopted as law by courts of justice it is al-ways uncertain whether it will be sustained by that saneTHE // tion or not . " 12 And , again , " The description , completion , and correction of positive morality are as much an end for which political government is wanted , as the obtain-ing by its establishment of a more cogent sanction . But the sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by the sanction with which he clothes it . " 13 It is obvious that the objections that have been founded on the historical evidences quoted by Wharton and Maine are applicable solely to the question of the origination of the principles embodied in the law , ? a question with which the Austinians are not concerned . Thus , when Maine says that the Indian despot never made a law , he can only mean that he never arbitrarily established a general rule of conduct . What he did do , however , was to accept such rules of conduct as rules of the State , and thereby , as the Analytical School claims , elevate such principles into legal rules . It is no answer to say that , in the case of many of the earlier monarchies , they were simply tax-collecting empires , and that there was no at-tempt , or even desire , on the part of their rulers to inter-fere with the domestic rules that obtained in the various portions of their kingdoms . The point is , that the very least important of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest courts or judi-cial officers , thereby obtained a sanction that was ultimately supported by the entire strength of the sover-eign political authority . Again , it is no answer to the assertion that the State is the sole creator of law to show that no State can maintain its control that does not in general accept as its will those principles of justice and utility that are evolved by the customary habit of its people ; that , in other words , the attempt on its part to establish arbitrary // rules of conduct not based on the needs and capacities of the people , as evidenced by their customary habits of life , would lead inevitably to revolt and revolution . This would only show that , as a principle of political expediency , ( i.e. , of caution and prudence ) , a general acceptance of customary rules is necessary . The fact that legislative commands or judicially declared principles of conduct are not enforced , or , possibly , can not be enforced because of the active or passive resistance upon the part of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not deprive these state-sanctioned orders of their right to be entitled laws ; for it is not the actual enforcement of a rule by the State which transmutes it into a positive law , but the authentic manifestation by the State that it accepts or declares that rule to be an expression of its sovereign will . Finally , it is not a refutation of the position which is here defended , to point to the fact that a court of justice , in accepting a custom as law , does not declare that henceforth such principle shall obtain as law , but holds it to have been the law at the time of the accruing of the cause of action whose merits are then decided . The position of Holland , who is possibly the best exponent of Austin 's system today , differs from that of Austin upon this point , and is an attempt , it would seem , to avoid the objection rather than to answer it . Holland says : " The Courts have , therefore , long ago established as a fundamental principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many restrictions and qualifications , that , in the absence of a specific rule of written law , regard is to be had in looking for the rule which governs a given set of circumstances , not only to equity and to previous decision , but also to custom . Binding authority has thus been conceded to custom , provided it fulfils certain requirements , the nature of which has also long since been // settled , and provided it is not superseded by law of a higher authority . When , therefore , a given set of cir-cumstances is brought into Court , and the Court decides upon them by bringing them within the operation of a custom , the Court appeals to that custom as it might to any other pre-existent law . It does not proprio motu then for the first time make that custom a law ; it merely de-cides as a fact that there exists a legal custom , about which there might up to that moment have been some question , as there might about the interpretation of an Act of Parliament . It then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have applied an Act of Parlia-ment to them . A good custom or an intelligible Act of Parliament either exists or does not exist objectively , be-fore the case comes into Court ; although it is from the decision of the Court in the particular case that a subjec-tive knowledge is first possible for the people of the ex-istence or non-existence of the alleged custom , or that this or that is the meaning of the Act of Parliament . " 14 It would certainly seem that Holland admits the very point against which he contends , when he says that the court does not for the first time make a custom a law by its adjudication , but " merely decides as a fact that there exists a legal custom about which there might up to that moment have been some question , as there might about the interpretation of an Act of Parliament . " This cer-tainly limits the action of the court to one of interpreta-tion . And , as one of his critics has properly said , " To say that customs are regarded as laws by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply to beg the whole question . It is to say that custom is law in virtue of custom . " 15 The proper position upon this point would seem to be to admit frankly that judicial legislation is ex post facto // legislation . But what has this to do with the question as to the effect of such decisions of the courts upon custom ? It is , to be sure , a general principle of legislation that laws should not be retroactive in their effect , but this is a principle dictated by general considerations of justice , and not of necessity . There is no more inherent difficulty in the State establishing retroactive law than there is in its creating law that shall be of only prospective application . That this is the case , is seen in the necessity of explicitly providing in our own written constitutions that neither Congress nor the State legislatures shall pass ex post facto enactments . In the case of legislatures not thus arbitrarily limited , as , for example , the British Parliament , no court would hold a retroactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laws established by means of formal statutory enactments , are , as a rule , created without reference to particular cases , and therefore injustice would necessarily result had such enactments a retroactive character . When , however , we come to judicial legislation , we come to a field where this ex post facto principle is not recognized , ? not recognized because from the very nature of the case no necessity of justice demands it . By the recognition of a custom as law , no arbitrary or novel doctrines of right are established by the court . Principles only are declared as enforcible that already obtain in practice among the people . Hence , no possible injustice is done by declaring such customs then and there to be laws , and at the same time applying them to the causes of action that have previously accrued . There is no need to predicate a tacit law to the effect that such customs shall be law , but simply to admit that judicial legislation is ex post facto legislation , and to defend it as such ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply interpretative , but actually creative of law . // We may , then , accept as valid the reasoning of Austin when he says : 16 " At its origin , a custom is a rule of conduct which the governed observe spontaneously or not in pursuance of a law set by a political superior . The custom is transmuted into positive law when it is adopted as such , either by being expressly embodied in statutes promulgated by the sovereign authority , or implicitly by decisions of the courts of justice which are enforced by the power of the State . " For a legal rule introduced by a judicial decision ( whether suggested by custom or not ) is in effect legisla-tion by the sovereign . A subordinate or subject judge is merely a minister . The rules which he makes derive their legal force from authority given by the State ; an authority which the State may confer expressly , but which it commonly imparts by way of acquiescence . For , since the State may reverse the rules which he makes , and yet permits him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its sovereign will that the rules shall obtain as law , is clearly evinced by its conduct though not by its express declaration Like other significations of desire , a command is express or tacit . If the desire be signified by words ( written or spoken ) the command is express . If the desire is signified by conduct ( or by any signs of desire which are not words ) the command is tacit . Now when customs are turned into legal rules by decisions of subject judges , the legal rules which emerge from the customs are tacit commands of the sovereign legislature . The State which is able to abolish , permits its members to express them ; and it therefore signifies its pleasure by its voluntary acquiescence , that they shall serve as a law to the governed . " // A little reflection shows how indefinite would be the term " law " if applied to custom and civil rules alike . So long as customary rules retain their purely customary form , that which gives to them force and efficiency for regulation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties by a superior power in case of their violation . Their force is solely derived from the pressure of public opinion , of religious sanction , of individual sense of right , or the possibility of personal retaliation on the part of those persons injured by such violation . Such influences as these are of the most variable character , and personal in the highest degree . Their force depends almost wholly upon the subjective condition of the individual , upon his own peculiar temperament of mind , his sense of justice , his religious reverence , his regard for the traditional , his power of self-restraint , and his sensitiveness to the goodwill of the community . Such principles , then , possess no force of their own , no compelling power ; obedience to them is secured only by the voluntary consent of the individual , such consent being based upon the dictates of reason , expediency , and right that dwell within his own breast . When , therefore , it is asked so to broaden the connotation of the term " law " as to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical exactness and scientific accuracy demand that a more definite meaning be given to this word . Definitions are valuable only insofar as they give a precision of meaning to words and expressions . Their sole utility consists in the demarcation of a definite field within which the word or phrase is applicable , and it will be apparent that to include within the meaning of law elements that differ so widely as the purely customary principles of which we have been speaking , and the rigid rules of conduct , formally enunciated by the State and enforcible by its sovereign right , is to // create a signification for the word that can not be suffi-ciently definite to serve as a basis upon which to found a formal science of jurisprudence and politics . What de-cisive and universally applicable definition shall we give to law , if custom is to share with the State the power of its creation ? When shall we know at any one time what is and what is not the law ? What but confusion must necessarily result from conceiving two co-ordinate law-making authorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , or to abrogate and overrule each other 's creations ? In result , then , we are justified in defining law , in the strict positive or juristic sense , as those rules of conduct that courts of justice apply in the exercise of their juris-dictions . As distinguished from all other rules of con-duct that obtain more or less general recognition in a com-munity of men , they are such as have for their validity the sanction of the State . The scientific value of such a definite connotation of the term " law " is obviously great . By it alone is rendered possible a definite and exact knowledge of the facts to which this department of knowledge relates , and a sound basis afforded upon which to rest the conception of the Sovereignty of the State.17 The sense in which the courts rather than the formal law-making or legislative branches of a government may be said to be organs through which the State creates its law has been examined in the preceding chapter in which the location of sovereignty in the body-politic was con-sidered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles by municipal courts is dis-cussed in the chapter entitled " International Law . " 18 The argument there stated applies as well to the recog-nition and enforcement by one State of the municipal law of another State . Permissive Laws . The objection to viewing laws as " commands " of the State , based upon the fact that many laws are permissive rather than mandatory or declaratory in character , is sufficiently answered by pointing out that in all cases where this is so there are created or recog-nized rights which have a legal force and which are pro-tected by laws which are mandatory in character . Of permissive and merely declaratory laws , it can always be claimed that they are to be considered not as complete legal provisions but as integral parts of the mandatory laws which support them . Considerable discussion has centered around the point whether the term law , in a positive or any other sense , should be limited in its application to those expressions of the States ' will which state a general rule . To the writer , however , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad-ministrative ordinance , even though it relate to the per-formance of but a single act by a particular individual , is a law ; that is , it expresses the sovereign will of the State if it is one which has the support of some more general law or is declared in pursuance of a legally delegated gov-ernmental power.19 Actual Enforcement Not an Essential Element in the Concept of Positive Law . A more difficult question is whether it is necessary that a rule should be actually enTHE // forced in order that it may properly be termed a law in a strictly positive sense . It is the opinion of the writer that this is not necessary . In discussing the nature of the State 's sovereignty it was pointed out that the ascription to the State of legal omni-competence carries with it no implication that the States , or rather those who control their governmental agencies , have the actual power to carry into effect any policies that they may desire or see fit to adopt . So , in determining what is positive law , the only criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authentic expres-sion of the State 's will as determined by existing constitu-tional law , ? is , in other words , a rule of conduct or a command which the constituted courts will , if resorted to , order obeyed . Such a court order may , in fact , be not obeyed either because the executive branch of the government refuses to lend its assistance , or because there is such popular resistance that the executive , though willing , finds itself unable to enforce it , or deems it inexpedient to do so . In such cases all that can be said is that there has been a violation of law which , however , no more destroys the law , as law , than is the criminal law destroyed when crime is committed.2 ? // Sanction . Austin and those who follow him emphasize in the concept of law , the element of sanction , by which they mean the penalty or evil threatened to be inflicted upon those legal inferiors who fail to obey the commands of their legal superiors . Thus , in his Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command is dis-tinguished from other significations of desire , not by the style in which the desire is signified , but by the power and the purpose of the party commanding to inflict an evil or pain in case the desire is disregarded . If you can not or will not harm me in case I comply not with your wish , the expression of your wish is not a command , although you utter your wish in imperative phrase . " Austin does not go to the extent of declaring that an unenforced command ceases to be a command , and is not , therefore , a law . He is content to assert that , in order that an expressed desire may be classified as a command , there should be some likelihood , however small , that some sort of evil or pain , however slight , will be inflicted by the one expressing the desire upon those to whom it is addressed who do not conform to it . Thus he says : " The magnitude of the eventual evil , and the magnitude of the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ques-tion . The greater the evil , and the greater the chance of incurring it , the greater is the efficiency of the command , and the greater is the strength of the obligation . But when there is the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil the expression of a wish amounts to a com-mand , and , therefore imposes a duty . " Austin here attenuates his own distinction between a // command and a wish to an extent that makes it a worthless one . In place of the idea thus rejected , the writer would emphasize the circumstance that a positive law , as distinguished from either a wish or a command has the official imprimatur of the State , and that this should be the essential fact connoted by the term Sanction . A law thus becomes an order or command issued by some one who claims a right upon his own part to the obedience of those whom he addresses , and , therefore , of a genuine obligation upon their part to obey . In the case of a divine law or command , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other conceived status of superiority which the Divine Being has as compared with that of the individuals whose conduct is sought to be regulated and controlled . In the case of a positive law , such as we are concerned with in the present treatise , the superiority of the law-giver is a political or legal one . This plainly appears when we have to deal with the distinction between de jure and de facto governments . When a person is directed to do a certain thing by a government which he does not recognize as having a legal right to control his actions , he can not deny that the direction amounts to a command , for he may know that serious evil or pain will almost surely be inflicted upon him in case he does not conform , in his conduct , to the direction he has received . But , even if he obeys , he does not admit that he has fulfilled a legal obligation . Upon the contrary , as to him , the matter has been nothing more than one of illegal force or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order does so in pursuance of a claim upon its part that it has a legal right to require the obedience of those to whom the order is addressed , the order is a positive law when regarded from the point of view of that Government . The true sanction of a positive law consists , then , in // the fact that the authority issuing it claims to be politically superior to the persons to whom it is directed ; or , looking at the law from the point of view of the ones commanded , that they recognize the law-issuing au-thority as having a legal right to regulate their conduct in the premises.22 CHAPTER XI THE ORIGIN OF THE STATE HISTORICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED ANALYTICAL jurisprudence is concerned not so much with the evolution of political institutions as with the juristic analysis of these institutions as they exist at any given time . Nevertheless , the determination of the his-torical processes by which distinctively political life has grown out of non-political , social life is not without im-portance since light is thus thrown upon the nature of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men . Furthermore , as to any given legally sovereign organization , it is important to deter-mine the manner in which its juristic birth may be inter-preted , and , if possible , to fix the moment in time of that birth . So , similarly , as will be discussed in the chapter which is to follow , it is important to determine the modes in which the juristic life of a State may be terminated and the juristic consequences which flow from such a dissolu-tion . First , then , we will speak , in general terms , of the historical origin of political life among men.l Historical Origins . The study of origins is always an attractive one , and the work of many anthropologists has thrown a vast amount of light upon the early history of social and political institutions . The parts played by consanguinity , by religion ( especially by the worship of ancestors ) , by the communal ownership of land and other 149 // economic interests , and , above all , by the influence of the family upon the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The significance of totem worship , of endogamy and exogamy , of polygamy of polyandry , and of patriarchal life has been discussed in the light of the facts presented by the earliest literary and archeological records , and interpreted by analogy with the present customs of races now in the lowest stages of civilization . All of these facts have been compared and exhaustively studied , but the absolute origin of civic life has not been historically determined . The fact is that the first subjection of man to public authority of some sort or other must have been practically coceval with the beginning of his social life , and this carries us back to periods of human development anterior to those that furnish historical records . Furthermore , even after we reach periods regarding which we have authentic historical information , we are often without exact knowledge as to the manner in which the men of those times viewed their own institutions . However , reasoning back from such later records as we have , and judging from analogy with the thoughts and customs of peoples of whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , form a fairly confident opinion as to the character of the ideas held concerning social and political institutions during their very early stages of development , if not at the time of their original institution . One thing we know with practical certainty , and this is that , from the time when any sense whatever of social or political obligation came to be recognized by men , the ideas of religious sanction , of customary obligation , and of legal authority , were so intermixed that they were not distinguished even in thought . Law , in a juristic sense , was not distinguished from what Austin would term // " positive morality , " and this morality was deemed to derive its obligatory force from super-human sources . A divine sanction or prohibition was attached to nearly every act of which the social group took any direct cognizance . The family group had its gods and its divinely ordered rules of conduct , as did the larger social groups of which the families were the constituent units . A " consciousness of kind " and common material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kept the groups together , but all the historical evidence that we have indicates that , to the individuals themselves , the uniting bond was conceived to be a religious one , and community of worship the one objective evidence of their unity . Thus , whatever may have been the actual origin or utilitarian basis of any recognized rule of conduct or principle of authority , the source was conceived to be in the will of the gods , and its compelling force derived from the evil which it was believed the gods would inflict upon those who should fail to conform to it . Regarding the probable historical steps by which political as distinguished from merely social institutions arose among men , and by which a corresponding distinction in thought between a political , a social or religious sense of obligation was created , varying theories or conclusions have been reached by anthropologists and other scholars . The Patriarchal Theory . According to the so-called Patriarchal theory , to which Sir Henry Maine and Herbert Spencer have given the support of their names , the primitive type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among the Aryans and Semites , was one in which all individuals were grouped into families or households , united by bonds of kinship ( real or fictitious ) , marriage , or domestic service , and ruled over in a practically absolute manner by the chief male or patriarch . // As long as this stage persisted , the family , according to this theory , remained the sole social unit and the patria potestas the only political authority . By a natural process of growth , as this theory goes on to hold , these families or , households grew into clans , the clans into tribes , and the tribes , by conquests and alliances , into nations . At the same time , corresponding to this increase in communal life , the political powers of the heads of the families de-veloped into those of the chiefs of the clans , and these , in turn , into the authority of the King of the tribe or of the nation . The simplicity and apparent reasonableness of this ex-planation of early social and political development imme-diately secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , witnessed a destructive criticism of it , especially by such writers as L. H. Morgan and J. F. McClennan 3 . According to these critics , social life in its earliest forms , exhibited a horde condition in which there was an almost complete promiscuity in sexual relations , and out of which , only as a later historical development , did patri-archal or family life , headed by the male , emerge . Whether or not the patriarchal type of family life was the original form of social organization , either generally or for particular races , is , after all , not a matter of con-siderable importance to the political scientist . But what is of importance to him is the fact that a better reading of history shows that the patriarch 's authority was not the germ out of which developed , by a natural process of growth , first the powers of the chiefs of the clans and tribes , and then those of the State . In addition , and what is of still more significance to the political scientist , is the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so different , in its very nature , from // political authority , that , as an a priori proposition , it is difficult to see how it could have developed into that authority . The Tribe . Viewed historically , it is probably true that , founded as it is upon the physical facts of parentage , there existed among all races of men some sort of family life before any other social units were formed . But it is equally probable , that , before the family grew into patriarchal form , a grouping into tribes had taken place . In truth , aside from the temporary association of mother and child , which the helpless condition of the latter necessitates , the tribal form of association is the simplest conceivable type of social and political organization . For its establishment and maintenance nothing more is needed than a slight feeling of friendship between its constituent members , and a recognition of its offensive or defensive value in war ? a recognition which stern experience must , at a very early time , have almost universally brought about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of government is needed than a chieftain whose right to direct and command is founded upon a personal prowess , and whose sphere of authority , in war , is that of a military commander , and , in peace , that of an arbitrator of private disputes . As savagery gave way by degrees to civilization , a double development undoubtedly went on . Upon the one hand , the authority of the tribe increased and its sphere of authority over its individual members widened ; while , upon the other hand , within the tribe , family life increased in its integrity and control until it assumed , in many communities at least , the patriarchal form . Thus , instead of the family developing into the tribe , the likelihood is that there was a synchronous or parallel development of both social units . The Clan . The historical relation of the clan , gens , or // sept to the family upon the one side , and to the tribe or nation upon the other side , has been a point even more disputed than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a once generally accepted theory was that the clans were originally formed from families , ? that several families united to form a clan , or that single families ultimately became so large as , in themselves , to constitute clans . Modern scholars , however , are now disposed to deny that this was the probable course of development . Morgan bases this denial upon the view that , in primitive societies , exogamy is the general rule . It is not necessary , however , to rest the denial of a genetic relationship between the clan and the family upon the more or less uncertain matter of exogamy . A better proof is that which proceeds from the fact that the aims , functions , and basis of membership of the clan are different from those of the family . The family is founded upon kinship , actual or assumed , and , in it , the degree of relationship is fundamental . Its head is , as a rule , determined by birth and not by voluntary selection on the part of its members , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority than as a leader or judge over them . In the clan , upon the other hand , although a certain degree of community of blood is usually present or assumed , degrees of relationship are not recognized , or , if recognized , are not deemed important . The real bond of union is a religious one . The clan possesses a certain amount of common property , it exercises certain important functions in the way of settlement of disputes between its members , and in furnishing mutual aid and protection ; but its one essential , avowed end is the maintenance of a common worship . In membership the clan resembles the tribe . That is to say , its constituent units are the individuals themselves and not groups of them . Its members are , of course , // grouped into families , just as are the citizens of the modern State , but the elementary cells are individuals , and whatever authority the clan possesses is exercised directly upon them.4 As to the historical relationship of the clan to the tribe , there is a dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a union of clans , others asserting that the tribe comes first in point of time , and later ex-hibits a differentiation into clans . It is not unlikely that , in some instances , clans united to form a tribe ; in other cases , that the tribal relationship was first established , and the clans a later development:5 The question as to which came first in point of time , the clan or the tribe , is of importance to the historian . To the political scientist the significant point is that these two types of human groupings were generally alike as regards both their form of organization and their units of mem-bership . Both were associations of individuals having common interests , and were ruled over by chiefs whose rights or rulership were based upon their personal qualifi-cations . The tribe thus differed from the clan rather in size and scope of functions than in essential nature . There were , however , the following differences : the fact of a general kinship was more emphasized in the clan than in the tribe , and the maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its gods and spiritual religious rites , just as had the clan , but com-munity of religion was rather one of the outward symbols // of tribal unity than the basis upon which it was founded . Primarily the tribe existed for the purpose of offence and defence against other tribes , and assistance in the per-formance of this duty was supposed to be obtained from the gods of the tribe . Upon the other hand , in the clan the maintenance of a particular worship was the chief aim sought , the elements of mutual help and com-mon ownership of property being secondary . Origin of Political Authority . As regards the genesis of political as distinct from social authority over men , it would seem to be clear that its beginning is to be traced to the tribe , or to the clan in those cases in which the tribe was a product of the growth of a clan or of the union of two or more clans . In other words , political authority can not be properly regarded as having developed out of the patriarchal authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held that some sort of family life must have existed before the formation of gentile or tribal associa-tions , the groups of such individuals thus formed can-not be said to have exhibited distinctively political char-acteristics : they were purely social units founded upon the facts of parentage . Their members were limited to specific determinate individuals . The bond of union was a temporary one , and the status of the members was that of virtual slaves or chattels of the family 's head , and not that of citizens . It is true that , in early times , the con-trol of many matters , now regulated by the commands of the State , was in the hands of the head of the family , but its interests and authority were essentially private in character . It never was , and never became a subject of public law.6 As contrasted with that of the family , the authority of the tribe must have been , from the beginning , purely political in character . Its chief derived his right to rule // from the actual agreement or acquiescence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership of the tribe , nor to the duration of its existence ; no degrees of citizenship were recognized ; and , so far as its sphere of control extended , it was sovereign and selfsufficient . It was not one of a number of groups of equal status and co-ordinate power which composed a larger social unit . It is of course true that , in the earliest times , the form of governmental organization that obtained was simple in the extreme , and that the extent to which the attempt was made to control the acts of its individual members , was comparatively slight , but , once established , the tribe and its authority furnished a beginning out of which the modern political State could develop by a mere process of elaborating its governmental organization and extending its control over additional human interests and activities . Thus , once established , an event which must have occurred very early in the history of every people , the tribe was able to grow , by conquest or natural increase , into the nation , its government into that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will into the great systems of jurisprudence which the complicated character of present day life makes necessary . Beginning with a jurisdiction that extended little beyond that of direction in times of war , and judgment in a comparatively few matters in times of peace , the tribe had but to stretch out gradually its control , first by way of increase of its executive and judicial functions , and then , finally , by the exercise of direct legislative authority , in order to develop into the sovereign body-politic of today which practically monopolizes the legal right to employ physical coercion . In this process of development , political authority has not changed its essential character , whatever may have // been the varying importance of the family or other social groupings within the body-politic . From the very beginning , as Hearn correctly says , " the State is not composed of other social organisms . Its members may be members of other social organisms , and the activities of these other social organisms may or may not clash , or tend to clash , with the activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete within itself , and its power , within its own sphere and over its own members , is supreme . It has its own worship , its own property , its own functions , its own claim upon its members , its own duties towards them . It respects the rights and duties of the other associations which it includes , and does not , at least in its earlier stages , seek to interfere with the relations of its members to any of those other associations . " 7 Psychological Origin of Political Authority . Just as it is an idea or sentiment that transmutes an aggregate of individuals into a Nation , so it is a desire for political unity that provides a psychological basis for the State . As the eminent Austrian publicist , Jellinek , has put it , " The inner ground of the origin of the State is the fact that an aggregate of persons has a conscious feeling of its unity , and gives expression to this unity by organizing itself as a volitional and active subject . " 8 It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many cases at least , the moving force that brings about the establishment of the State , , but the mere existence of this psychological condition , granting , in a particular instance , that it exists , is not sufficient ground for asserting that a body-politic has been created . A State is not born until this subjective condition leads to the existence , in objective fact , of a ruling political orThe Aryan Household , p. 318 . For an excellent popular discussion of the development of the modern State from its primitive form see Edward Jenks , The State and the Nation , published in 1919 . Die Lehre von den Staatenverbindungen , p. 157. // ganization . Other conditions favoring , or at least not hindering , this objective realization will result from the subjective inclination . But , except in rare cases , there is not this absence of hindrance . The political status quo ante has always to be considered . Existing political institutions and methods have the support of tradition , backed by the natural indisposition of men to change their habits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with absolute precision the results that will follow from a change . And , most of all , an existing political authority is always supported by an enormous weight of selfish interest . To the desire to rule , which is almost universal in the human breast , are added the material and social interests and honors that are bound up in an existing political regime , thus making those in power reluctant to consent to even a change in administration , much less to the establishment of a new bodypolitic . It thus frequently happens that there exists in the minds of a community of people a desire for a political unity of a particular sort , and that this desire would be of sufficient strength to maintain the unity of a State , were it once established and organized , but that objective conditions prevent for many years the realization of such an end . It is only when this pent-up flood of feeling rises to sufficient height and strength to burst the existing political barriers that hold it in , that a new State is created . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethnic or cultural unity is to find expression in political unity . The two sentiments , then , that lie at the basis of the Nation and of the State are largely similar . The same conditions that tend to create the feeling of Nationality tend also , in most cases , to demand the establishment of the State . Absolute identity of these two sentiments , however , can not be affirmed . It is possible , in other // words , for a well developed feeling of Nationality to exist with but slight desire for political unity . On the other hand , we find instances in which the establishment of political unity is clearly demanded by a People , among whom there is no other claim of Nationality . The factors that create the feeling of Nationality are community of race , language , historical tradition , mutuality of economic interests , and like degree of civilization . That which calls for the establishment of political control over a definite territory and community may be nothing more than political expediency , the necessity for self-defensive or offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very strong at the time of the severance of the American colonies from their mother country , yet independent political organization was nevertheless demanded and obtained by the Americans . Strong feelings of common Nationality were frequently displayed by the Greeks , especially when combating a common foe , yet at no time during the height of Grecian posperity was political unity called for . At the present day we see three distinct Nationalities organized under the Swiss Government with no demand for separate political existence . To those who would say that a national feeling does not truly exist unless there be a demand for political unity , that , in other words , the desire for such unity is a necessary consequence of the feeling of Nationality , it is to be replied , that this gives a more intensive and exacting definition to the sentiment of Nationality than is usually ascribed to it . It is an obvious fact that we often have instances of political unions in which there is an absence of such elements as community of race , language , custom , and historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire for political unity , even before it obtains realization , with the sentiment of // Nationality , unless we assume the position that only political expediency is able to create the feeling of Na-tionality . But to do this is not only to go counter to all accepted usage of terms , but , in fact , entirely to de-stroy the very idea of Nationality , which is supposed to rest upon other than political foundations . Though ' intimately connected , it seems best , then , to distinguish from each other the feelings of National and Political unity ; in fine , to recognize that though the desire for political unity does , as a rule , arise from and out of a sentiment of Nationality , it may arise independently of it . An attempt to argue the existence of a State and of political sovereignty from the mere fact of a condition of mind which has not found outward objective ex-pression is seen in the ' argument of Professor Burgess in support of his contention that a National State ex-isted in America during the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American colonies against their mother country , that is , before the adoption , in 1789 , of the Federal Constitution . During the years when the former colonies were associated under the Articles of Confederation ? from 1781 to 1789 ? he is forced to admit that the thirteen former colonies were severally sovereign , for the Articles incontestably con-stituted only a League and not a constitutional Union , but this sovereignty , thus enjoyed by the States he speaks of as " usurped . " 9 In thus speaking , however , it is clear that he is led to take positions that are logically absurd , for it must appear that , if there had been a real will upon the part of the people during those years to create a National State , one would have come into being . And equally we must hold that the existence of the Thirteen States as several sovereign bodies must have been due // to a will to that effect upon the part of those who con-stituted their citizen bodies . There has been inclination on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier types of political life , especially to those undeveloped groups which have not obtained for themselves a settled abode . Those taking this ground must be considered as governed by a special conception of the State . Accord-ing to the conception adopted in the present work desig-nation of State can not be refused to any independ-ent society of men that is politically organized.10 In other words , low order of development does not deprive an institution of its generic name . A society is politi-cally organized if it have established within it and over it a public authority for the control of those interests that are connected with its orderly existence , and the enforcement of its jural ideal , however crude and limited that ideal may be . Thus organized , a society of men is properly embraced within the scope of the Staatsidee and is as truly a State as when in its more developed form . To make this point clear , we can , for this particular purpose , liken the term " State " as used in Political Sci-ence to the term " living being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not refuse to recognize as living beings the lowest orders of life , even though they be but mere splotches of protoplasm , so structureless and homogeneous in composition that different individuals can be scarcely distinguished , and in each of which the // most powerful microscope is barely able to discover differentiation of parts . The point that is conclusive to him is that such beings have crossed the line from the inorganic to the organic , from the inert to the living , and that within them is contained a possible growth , a potential development . Likewise , for purposes of illustration , we may compare , though not identify , the growth of the living being toward a higher life , with the development of political institutions . In both there appear an increasing differentiation of parts , and growth in variety of their needs . As the higher forms are assumed , the organism becomes more definitely and delicately constructed ; its activities become increasingly self-directive , until finally the self-conscious individual appears . At the same time that this elaboration of structure has proceeded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ from one another until the number of classes , genera , and species becomes almost beyond estimate . The development of political society is characterized by these same features . With the advance of civilization come augmented social needs and activities . The governmental organization of the State becomes a more complex structure , and is endowed with wider , and , at the same time , more definite power , and the exercise of these powers becomes more intelligently controlled , and in a sense self-directed , that is , dictated rather by the interests of the governed than by the personal interests of the individuals in whom the exercise of the State 's powers happens to be entrusted . Likewise , from substantial similarity of governmental organization , in the early stages , States , in the course of their development , assume diverging forms . Geographic , ethnic , economic , and moral conditions , all have their influence in determining the direction in which the development of // political forms proceeds . Distinctions arise as to the number of interests to be regulated by the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall participate , either actively or by way of popular control , in the administration of their public affairs , and as to the manner in which the powers of the State shall be distributed among its several departments . Thus arise all those varieties of governments running from the despotic Oriental State to the democracy of the Swiss communes . Later arise such forms as the feudal State , and the socalled national State . Within each of these classes are also to be found the members distinguished from each other by the greatest variety of internal organizations . The manner and order in which these various forms have historically appeared , belong , however , rather to historical and descriptive Political Science , than to Political Philosophy . There has been some speculation upon the part of political theorists as to the minimum number of individuals required in order to constitute a State . It would seem that no such minimum can be logically fixed . As our argument proceeds , it will appear that all of the essential juristic elements of the State are such as can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of individuals . Aristotle fixes a limit below which the number of citizens should not go , but this is based not so much upon logical grounds as upon the non-juristic principle that when a community is so small that there is not the possibility of a varied life the true ethical aim of the State can not be attained . Austin denies the possibility of a State being constituted from a single family upon the ground of its absurdity , and quotes Montesquieu as taking the same position.11 After admitting that a single family living in total estrangement from every ' Spirit of Laws , book I , chap . III . // other community might exhibit all the traits of an inde-pendent political society , Austin , however , says : " But , since the number of its members is extremely minute , it would , I believe , be esteemed a society in a state of nature ; that is , a society consisting of persons not in a state of subjection . Without an application of the terms , which would somewhat smack of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and inde-pendent. , the imperative father and chief a monarch or sovereign , or the obedient mother and children sub-jects. " 12 As to this Clark says:13 " In this dominion so-called ( ownership ) of the original patriarch , law is possible . He may , that is , govern by general rules . It is not , however , probable , because he would have little interest in setting , or at least in adhering to , such rules . He would be more likely to govern by means of occasional commands . " In other words , though it is entirely im-probable that a single , isolated family should ever be-come politically organized , it is not logically impossible . It is not the size but the lack of that element of possible perpetuity of dominion that prevents the family from becoming , as such , a State.14 CHAPTER XII THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF THE STATE JURISTICALLY CONSIDERED THE juristic birth of a particular State occurs when the political organization that is involved first assumes , or becomes endowed with , the attribute of sovereignty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined , if it has occurred within a period concerning which authentic historical records exist , it is first necessary that some conclusions be reached as to the tests by which the existence of the quality of sovereignty in a given body-politic may be certainly recognised , and some agreement be reached as to the processes by which this juristic attribute may be created . It will conduce to clearness of thought if we separate the discussion of the tests by which the existence of sovereignty may be determined , from the juristic processes by which sovereignty may be brought into being . And first as to the processes . One Sovereignty Can not Create Another Sovereignty . It would seem to be a necessary logical conclusion from the nature of sovereignty that legal authority can not , by its own will or act , create another authority legally superior or even equal to itself . The created can not be the equal and much less the superior of its creator : it necessarily remains but the agent for the exercise of the authority of the political being that brings it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity functions volitionally , it can do no more than express what , in the last analysis , is the legal will of its legal progenitor . Sovereignty Can not Be Created by a Union of Sovereign-166 // ties . The same reasoning applies to the attempt of a number of severally sovereign political entities to create , by a joint action or common agreement among themselves , an authority legally superior to themselves . A general or public will , in other words , can not be created by a mere union of individual or private wills . Thus , a number of severally sovereign States may create for themselves organs of government which each of them will severally regard as their own ' governmental organs for the purposes specified , and through which they will be able to maintain concerted and unified action . But they can not create above and over themselves a sovereign body-public . As a result , sovereign States may enter into agreements or compacts with one another by which they or their peoples become morally or politically or internationally obligated , but they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty or compact into which they have entered or , by that treaty or compact , create a legal superior which , for the future , can legally control them by its commands . John C. Calhoun , in his Discourse on the Constitution and Government of the United States , expounded the logic of this proposition in a manner that has since permitted no successful denial . His argument is so cogent that it may profitably be quoted at length . Starting with the premise that the Constitution of the United States of America was , in its essential character , a product of the concurring wills of the original thirteen severally sovereign American Commonwealths , he says of its National instrument of government : " They ( the States ) stand ( to it ) in the relation of superior to subordinate ? the creator to the created . The people of the several States called it into existence , and conferred by it on the Government , whatever power or authority it possesses . Regarded simply as a constitu168 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW tion , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitutions , and it imposes no more restrictions on the exercise of any of their sovereign rights than they do . " Such , says Calhoun , remains the relation of the States to their common agent , the National Government . As between themselves , the States having ratified and adopted the constitution , " they stand to it in the relation of parties to a constitutional compact , and of course , it is binding between them as a compact , and not on or over them as a Constitution . But , as solemn and sacred as it is , and as high as the obligations may be which it imposes , still it is but a compact and not a Constitution , regarded in reference to the people of the several States in. their sovereign capacity . . . Hence , a State , acting in the same manner in which it ratified and adopted the constitution , may be guilty of violating it as a compact , but can not be guilty of violating it as a law . The case is the reverse as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual capacity . To them it is a law , ? the supreme law within its sphere . They may be guilty of violating it as a law , or of vio-lating the laws and treaties made in pursuance of , or under its authority , regarded as laws or treaties , but can not be guilty of violating it as a compact . The con-stitution was established over them by their respective States , to whom they owed allegiance , and they are under the same obligation to respect and obey its authority , within its respective sphere , as they are to respect and obey their respective State constitutions ; and for the same reasons , namely : that the State to which they owe allegiance , commanded it in both cases . " ' Sovereignty Can not Be Transferred . It follows from what has been already determined , that one sovereign // State can no more obtain its sovereignty by a transfer from another sovereign State already in being , than it can create de novo , a sovereignty over and above itself . As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one State extends its jurisdiction over the citizen body and lands of another State , and , not infrequently , this extension is marked and evidenced by the formal consent of the governing authorities of the State whose lands and citizens are thus absorbed . But , juristically viewed , the change is due to a unilateral act upon the part of the annexing State , which , exercising its sovereign au-thority , asserts its legal control over the annexed lands and their inhabitants . In other words , the political jurisdiction thus obtained owes its juristic validity in no wise to any consenting act of the State previously having jurisdiction over the lands and peoples that have come under the new sovereignty . This is true even when the transfer of sovereignty is provided for by a treaty between the two States concerned . In such a case the treaty acknowledges rather than accomplishes the transfer . 112 // Juristically viewed the same result is obtained when we have to deal with the recognition by a State of the independence of a colony or province which has with-drawn from beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a case the existence of the new State dates from the time of the withdrawal , and not from the time when its independence is conceded by the parent State ; and the existence of its sovereignty is founded upon the fact that it no longer recognizes allegi-ance or renders obedience to the old sovereignty , and not upon the fact that the old sovereignty has by a treaty or other form of declaration indicated that it no longer claims its allegiance . So , similarly , the sover-eignty of any new State which is recognized by other States as such and admitted into the " Family of Nations " is not created by or founded upon , such international recognition . That recognition is extended by each State when it sees fit , and , when accorded , is nothing more than an acknowledgment of an accomplished fact . There is no claim that the recognition is a creative act ; and this fact is shown , if indeed any demonstration is needed , that it frequently happens that recognition of a new sovereignty is denied by one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the other States . If , then. , a creative character were assigned to " Recogni-tion " the absurd result would be reached that the new State both existed and did not exist , its status being determined not by any real fact of independent existence , but , in each case , by what might fortuitously happen to be the state of mind of other bodies-politic . Applying the foregoing reasoning , by way of illustra-tion , to the United States of America , it is seen that the colonies formerly in allegiance to Great Britain acquired // , ; heir sovereignties when they organized themselves as Independent communities . Their autonomous condition did not date from the promulgation of the treaty of peace with the mother country , but , if any precise date can be assigned to it , from the signing of the Declaration of Independence . This doctrine was accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of McIl-va.ine v. Coxe 's LesseO in the opinion in which case it is said : " The several States which compose this Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be-came entitled , from the time when they declared them-selves independent , to all the rights and powers of sover-eign States , and they did not derive them from conces-sions made by the British King . The treaty of peace contains a recognition of their independence , not a grant of it . " A somewhat different proposition is presented when a new State emerges from the Union of two or more sov-ereign States . The juristic interpretation of this political transaction will receive full consideration in the chapter dealing with the so-called Composite State . It is suffi-cient here to say that where there is such a merger of formerly sovereign States and the creation of a single new sovereign body , the original States must be con-ceived to have gone out of existence , and the bodies-politic which continue to bear their name and apparently continue their existence , must be regarded as new bodies-politic of an essentially different nature . They are non-sovereign bodies 4 which , in contemplation of constitu-tional law , are the creations of the new sovereignty , and have a status only insofar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The original sovereignties cease to exist ; and the new sovereignty rests upon its own basis // and is not the product of their union . Their agreement to unite , as evidenced in a treaty or other instrument , is thus of no juristic significance . Its importance is purely political , marking , as it does , merely the acquiescence of the peoples of the original States , or , at least , of their governing bodies , in their dissolution as independent bodies-politic , and their willingness to live under the new sovereignty which is to come into being . Where a portion of the lands and the citizens of one State are transferred from beneath one sovereignty and brought under the jurisdiction of another sovereignty , there is clearly no transfer of its sovereignty by the one State to the other . Both States remain in existence with their several sovereignties unimpaired.5 To the historian it may be convenient to date the origin of a new State from the adoption of a constitution , as , for example , to date the birth of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution must be viewed as a Law , ? as the product of the legislative will of a State already in existence , and as providing an out-line for its governmental machinery . The State itself must be conceived of as the product of the desire and will of a people to maintain a political existence as a group , as a sovereign legal person , acknowledging no legal control arising outside of its own will . Synchronously with the establishment of this political unity is the estabTHE // lishment , more or less spontaneously and informally , of new instrumentalities for the expression of the State 's will or the adoption as its own for the same purpose of old governmental organs already in existence . Thus , if we conceive that a sovereign national state existed in 1789 , we must view that State as accepting ad hoc , as its own organs the conventions in the several States which ratified the Constitution . Non-Juristic Origin of Sovereignty . In result , then , we may say that , strictly speaking , a juristic origin can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were , de novo , and can not have any legal bonds that unite it to any previously existing political body . Juristically a new State can take its origin only by the entire withdrawal of the people organized under it from the civic bonds under which they may have been living , and the establishment by them of a new body-politic . Not until the old State has been destroyed , either peaceably or by force , can the new State take its rise . It can not derive its vitality from the old , for , as we have seen , the transference of sovereignty is a legal impossibility . A State Can not Commit Juristic Felo de Se . It has been earlier pointed out that the sovereign State may , through its constitutional law , fix the manner in which and the governmental organs through which , its sovereignty is to be exercised , but that these self-set constitutional limitations are necessarily repealable by the State , acting in pursuance of that same sovereign authority which enabled it to establish them in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither destroyed nor impaired . It has also been shown that a change in form of the governmental organization of a State does not mean that the existence of the State has been destroyed and a new sovereignty created . // Dicey in his Law of the Constitutions says : " The im-possibility of placing a limit on the exercise of sover-eignty , does not in any way prohibit either logically or as a matter of fact , the abdication of sovereignty . This is worth observation because a strange dogma is sometimes put forth that a sovereign power , such as the Parliament of the United Kingdom , can never by its own act divest itself of sovereignty . The position , however , is clearly untenable . An autocrat , such as the Russian Czar , can undoubtedly abdicate ; but sovereignty , or the possession of a supreme power in a State , whether it be in the hands of a Czar or of a Parliament , is always one and the same quality . If the Czar can abdicate , so can Parliament . To argue or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ) it can not be surrendered ( which is palpably untrue ) involves the confusion of two distinct ideas . It is like arguing that because no man can , while he lives , give up , do what he will , his freedom of volition , so no man can commit suicide . A sovereign power can divest itself of authority in two ways , and ( it is sub-mitted ) in two ways only . It may simply put an end to its own existence . Parliament could extinguish itself by legally dissolving itself and leaving no means whereby a subsequent Parliament could be legally summoned . A sovereign , again , may transfer sovereign authority to another person or body of persons . " Here it is clear that Dicey is confusing the existence of the sovereign State with the continuance of the gov-ernmental machinery through which its sovereignty is exercised . The abdication of an absolute monarch or the surrender of power by a legally omnipotent legislative body does not operate to destroy the State which stands back of those governmental agencies.7 // The Annexation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instances have occurred , however , in which one State , by its own official act , has consented to its own absorption into another State and thus to a cessation of its own independent existence . An illustration of this was exhibited in 1897-1898 , when the Hawaiian Islands were incorporated into and be-came an integral part of the territory of the United States . Article XXXII of the Constitution of the Re-public of Hawaii , adopted in 1894 , expressly authorized the President , with the approval of his Cabinet and rati-fication of the Senate , to make a treaty of political union between the Republic and the United States of America . The power thus granted was exercised in 1897 , a treaty providing for union with the United States being nego-tiated by the President with the approval of his Cabinet and ratified by the Hawaiian Senate . This treaty was not , however , ratified by the treaty-making organ of the United States ? the President and Senate . Instead , a Joint Resolution was adopted on July 7 , 1898 , by the two Houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " Whereas , the Government of the Republic of Hawaii having in due form signified its consent , in the manner provided by its Constitution , to cede absolutely and with-out reserve to the United States the absolute fee and ownership of all public Government or crown lands , public buildings or edifices , ports , harbors , military equipment , and all other public property of every kind and description belonging to the Government of the // Hawaiian Islands together with every right and appurtenance thereto appertaining ; therefore be it " Resolved , that said cession is accepted , ratified and confirmed and that the said Hawaiian Islands and their dependencies be , and they are hereby annexed as a part of the territory of the United States , and are subject to the sovereign dominion thereof , and that all and singular the property and rights hereinbefore mentioned are vested in the United States of America . " Later , on August 12 , 1898 , upon the occasion of the formal raising of the American flag over the Hawaiian Islands , Mr. Dole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic , addressing the American representative , said : " A treaty of political union having been made , and the cession formally consented to by the Republic of Hawaii having been accepted by the United States of America , I now in the interest of the Hawaiian bodypolitic , and with full confidence in the honor , justice and friendship of the American people , yield up to you as the representative of the Government of the United States , the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands . " Analyzing the foregoing steps by means of which the absorption of Hawaii into the United States , and its consequent disappearance as a sovereign entity was effected , it is clear that , so far as the United States was concerned , no more than a moral or political significance was attached to the fact that the Hawaiian Government , presumably voicing the wishes of the Hawaiian people , had given its assent to the annexation . As a legal proposition , the extension of American sovereignty over the Islands resulted from the act of the American Government as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , if any , which the action of the Hawaiian // Government had as towards the Hawaiian people or State , it can be said that it was not an illegal act since it was one authorized by the Hawaiian constitution ; and yet it can not be said to have operated , ipso facto , to terminate the juristic life of the Hawaiian State . That did not occur until the American sovereignty was extended over the Islands and their inhabitants . It is correct , therefore , to say that , even in this case , in which express constitutional authority was given to the Government to agree to union with the United States , the annihilating stroke to the Hawaiian sovereignty was the act of the American State . Summary . In result then , we are justified in saying that , as regards the termination of sovereignty , the situation is the reverse of that of its birth or creation . In other words , every State derives its sovereignty from itself . Sovereignty is a spontaneous or self-generated status and is never derived from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of a sovereign State necessarily results from the act of another State , except perhaps in the conceivable case of the disappearance of every vestige of political authority over a people brought about by the acts of that people and without acceptance by them of the sovereignty of or the assertion of such sovereignty by another State . As contrasted with the birth of a sovereign body-politic , the creation of a non-sovereign body is always due to the juristic act of some other sovereign State . But , sovereign and non-sovereign entities are alike as regards their death or destruction . In both cases this is brought about by the act of another State . Tests for the Determination of the Existence of Sovereignty . As has been above pointed out , the question as to the manner in which , from a juristic point of view , a sovereignty may be created or terminated , is distinct // from the enquiry as to the tests by which the existence of a sovereign body-politic may be determined . The conclusion that we have reached that each sovereignty begins de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign will , leads necessarily to the proposition that the existence or non-existence of sovereignty is , strictly speaking , a matter of fact rather than of law . This fact is whether or not the political organization in question is regarded as having complete juristic competence to determine its own legal powers . The phrase " recognized as having " is used advisedly since it points to the fact that if sovereignty , in its strict juristic sense , be divorced from the ideas of physical power , of ethical rights , or of political expediency , the question whether or not a given political organization is an agency of a legal sovereignty depends upon the point of view from which it is regarded . It is not only conceivable , but often the actual case , that a given government is regarded by certain of the individuals of a community as legally entitled to declare and enforce the will of the sovereign State , whereas other persons of that same community assert that the Government in question has no legal basis and therefore that it is not qualified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will to which they conceive themselves to be subject , and , consequently , that such actual powers of coercion over them as it is able to exercise are matters of mere superiority of might and not of legal right . Thus arises the important distinction between Governments de facto merely , and those which are de jure . De Facto and De Jure Governments Distinguished . As an abstract or detached proposition , it can not be said that any given government is de jure or de facto , for the : ipplication of the terms necessarily depends upon the points of view of those who employ them . Thus a govTHE // ernment is de jure as well as de facto when it is recognized as such by the individuals over whom its control is extended . It is de facto but not de jure as to any particular individual when , though actually in existence and able to exercise a certain amount of power , its legal character is denied by him . Thus , in the case of an attempted revolution , from the standpoint of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who refuse obedience to its government , and have organized for themselves a new political machinery , the old government has only an actual and not a legal existence , the new government being the only one which , in their eyes , possesses a legal basis . Upon the other hand , from the point of view of those who still support the old State , the newly established government has but a de facto existence , the old government being regarded as the only legal organization . Thus , during the American Civil War , the existence of the Southern Confederacy as a State , though regarded as de jure by its adherents , was never recognized by the United States nor by Foreign Powers . The existence of a de facto Confederate Government was , however , recognized by the United States for belligerent purposes . The continued allegiance of its supporters to the United States was , however , always asserted by the United States , and no legal force of any sort was ever ascribed , then , or after the end of the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No formal treaty of peace was entered into between the United States and the Southern Confederacy , the surrender of its armies being received simply as military acts , and its Government permitted to go out of actual existence without any formal action to mark its demise . Thus , also , in 1660 , when the Stuarts were restored to rule in England , the beginning of the reign of King Charles II was dated from the death of his father , Charles // I , in 1649 , for , from the standpoint of the Stuarts , the Commonwealth Government , though in actual control for more than a decade , had never had more than a de facto existence . So , also , when the Bourbons again as-cended the . French throne , the first ruler took the title of Louis the Eighteenth , although the legitimate succes-sor of Louis the Sixteenth never , in fact , for a moment held the reins of government . If he had done so , how-ever , he would have been styled Louis the Seventeenth . During the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of revolu-tionary rule in France , the governments that existed were , of course , de jure , regarded from the points of view of their supporters . No government which is regarded as de facto can be said to evolve by mere efliuxion of time into a de jure government . Therefore Bryce is not correct when he says : " Sovereignty de facto , when it has lasted for a certain time and shown itself stable , ripens into sover-eignty de jure. " 8 What really happens in such a case is that the persons who at first deny a legal character to the de facto government abandon this point of view , accept the situation of fact , and give their allegiance to the existing government . Final Test of Sovereignty . In the chapter which follows , dealing with the Federal State , we shall have occasion to apply , in the case of the United States , the dis-tinction that has been made between governments de facto merely , and those which are de jure , and also to examine the juristic tests by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Union , the sovereignty resides in the National body or is retained by each of the constituent States . The general proposiTHE // tion may here be laid down , however , that the presence or absence of sovereignty in a given political entity depends upon whether or not that entity has such complete control over its own legal competence that it can not , against its own legal will , be legally bound in any way whatsoever by the legal will of another political body . This is the one and final test of sovereignty . The sovereign state may , in other words , bind itself to any extent by its own will , in the form of constitutional limitations laid upon the powers of its own governmental agencies , or , by treaties it may give its undertaking to other States not to exercise certain of its powers , or to exercise them only in certain ways , but these self-set limitations it may legally ? if not morally ? escape from by an exercise of that same sovereign will in pursuance of which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , then , we find a political entity so united to , or so associated with , another political entity that it can not escape from that union or association without a breach of law , as distinguished from a violation of international or moral obligation , it is not a sovereign State . If , upon the other hand , it can escape without its secession being an illegal act , it remains sovereign . Having this right , it may , while still retaining its sovereignty , enter into comprehensive agreements as to conforming its actions to those of other States with which it may associate itself , or as to accepting as its own the acts of a common governing agency which it , or those other States , may have agreed to establish and maintain . The foregoing reasoning applies to cases in which a new sovereignty is created in derogation of one or more pre-existing sovereignties . When this is not the case , whatever political changes may occur relate only to alterations in governmental structure . No new State is created and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // as has been earlier adverted to in the chapter dealing with Government , even when the changes in political organization have been brought about by means not sanctioned by pre-existing constitutional law . In this latter case it is perhaps possible to conceive of the State , as organized in its older Government , as going out of existence and a new State as being born with a new Government . But such an interpretation hardly seems necessitated by juristic logic . It would mean that , with the demise of the older sovereignty , all the existing legal rights and duties , public and private , would have to be regarded as destroyed , because the legal basis upon which they had rested would have been removed , and they would then have to be conceived of as impliedly recreated by the new sovereignty . It seems simpler and sufficiently logical to regard the original State as maintaining a continued existence and as having merely given to itself , by an original and direct constitutive act , a new governmental organization . CHAPTER XIII THE FEDERAL STATE THE facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles that have been evolved with reference to the subject of Sovereignty , are those pre-sented by the various types of so-called Composite or Federal States.l To many publicists , these political forms exhibit examples of States with divided or limited sovereignty , of non-sovereign political bodies but yet en-titled to be termed States , and of sovereign States juris-tically created by the joint action of other States . Associations of States . The problem of properly classi-fying and designating the various associations into which the States of the world have at different times entered , is one that has especially attracted the attention of Ger-man publicists . The most important work in this field is , perhaps , that of Jellinek , entitled " Die Lehre von den Staatenverbindungen , " which we have already had occasion to cite . Other works are those of Brie , 2 Wester-kamp , 3 and Waitz.4 This subject is also , of course , con-183 // sidered by all writers dealing particularly with the public law of the German Empire . The work of Laband ? is especially valuable in this respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own States , have generally limited themselves to a consideration of the differences between a " Federal State " and a " Confederacy. " 6 Jellinek , in his classification of associations , makes the first division into Unorganized and Organized Unions. ? These names serve to indicate the distinction that is made between the two classes . In the first class are included instances in which more or less permanent relations between States have been entered into for the regulation of certain mutual interests , but in which no central organization has been created . Such common action as is necessary in these unions is had through one or more of the governmental organs of the individual States . Of course there is not created in any of such cases what would be called a Composite State even by those publicists who use the term " non-sovereign State . " Within this category fall such types as " Alliances " for offence or defence , and for the guarantee of particular rights or status , as , for example , the perpetual neutrality of particular territories . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Staatenstaat , or that form of union in which there is a superior and an inferior State or States , the latter receiving the orders from the former as from a ? Das Staatsrecht des Deutschen Reiches . ? Professor A. B. Hart is the author of a monograph entitled , " An Introduction to the Study of Federal Government " ( Harvard Univ . Historical Monographs , No. 2 ) , which is rich in bibliographical matter . The work is , however , descriptive and comparative , rather than theoretical . The work of the English historian Freeman , entitled Federal Government , is limited to an historical examination of the Grecian types . ' Here , again , it is more accurate to speak of associations rather than of unions of States , for , as has been earlier pointed out , States can not form juristic unions . It is believed , however , that no confusion of I bought will be caused by conforming to the general usage of terms . // Foreign Power , and the citizens of the inferior States owing allegiance only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this type have been the feudal States of the Middle Ages , and the mediseval German Empire . Of this nature , also , have been the re-lations between the Ottoman Porte and some of its Christian Provinces , as well as the relation between the United States and some of the Indian tribes . Of this order was the relation of Egypt and Turkey , and of Nicaragua and the Mosquito Indians. $ All of the above unions Jellinek designates as unor-ganized unions of a juristic character ( Nichtorganisirte Verbindungen mit juristischem Charakter ) . We may properly ask ourselves , however , whether these " Alli-ances " constitute in any proper sense of the word " unions " of States . Every international treaty provides for the regulation of certain interests in common , and according to conditions mutually agreed upon . In the above-mentioned instances there is not the first begin-ning made or step taken toward the fusion of the con186 THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF PUBLIC LAW tracting States . Certainly , at any rate , they can not be designated as unions of a juristic character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations are not of this character.9 Coming now to " Organized Unions " we find in them , as their name imports , permanent central organs . They admit of segregation into the four following classes : ( 1 ) International Administrative Unions , ( 2 ) The Realunion and Personalunion , ( 3 ) The Staatenbund ( Confed-eracy ) , and ( 4 ) The Bundesstaat ( Federal State ) . Examples of the first sub-class are combinations of States for the common regulation of particular interests wherein permanent administrative authorities are cre-ated . Of this kind are the commissions for the regula-tion of navigation upon the rivers Po and Danube , and the international Postal and Telegraph Unions . There is the same objection to considering these types of unions of States that we have made to the whole of the class of unorganized unions above considered . By the term " Realunion " is indicated by German pub-licists that composite type of State life in which there is an intimate and lasting union entered into between two or more sovereign States , according to which there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a recognition and protection of the constitu-tional rights of each of the uniting States . Thus , it is " that form which arises when two or more independent States unite for common protection , according to which one and the same physical person appears as the repre-sentative of the States ' authority and according to which the extending of this union to other functions is not for-bidden. " 10 In other words , the essential element of the Realunion is that it is provided by the constitution of // each member State that the representative of its Sovereignty ( Repreisentationshoheit ) shall be in one and the same physical person , and that this connection shall obtain irrespective of who the prescribed qualifications happen to determine this common ruler shall be . The most conspicuous example of this form of union is that formerly exhibited by Austria and Hungary , and Norway and Sweden . And , it may be added , the relation between Great Britain and its " Dominions " is tending toward , if it has not already reached , this type of political association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realunion from a simple sovereign State whose organization provides for distinct governmental agencies in different portions of its domain is that the members of the union are true sovereign States and that though the powers of the Crown of all of them are vested in the same individual , that individual is constitutionally viewed as having as many distinct official or public personalities as there are States over which he rules . Thus it is possible that , as to one of the States he may be constitutionally regarded as the original and subsisting source of all legal authority , while , as to another of the States he may be viewed as possessing only such powers as have been delegated to him by the citizen body from whose will it is assumed that all legal legitimacy is derived . A type of union much resembling the Realunion , and , in fact , juristically of the same class , is the so-called Personalunion . The distinction between the two consists merely in the fact that the associated States come to have the same ruler only by reason of the casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their several systems of constitutional law , happen to call i o their thrones the same person . In such cases the union of course lasts only during the reigns of such monarchs . Of // this character were the relations for a time between England and Hanover , Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein , Prussia and Neuenburg ; and such was the relation that once existed between Holland and Luxemburg . In these cases the ruler is to be considered as possessing as many political personalities as there are States under his rule . It is thus proper to consider each of the members of a Personalunion as well of the Realunion as having its own ruling head . The Sovereignty of each of the individual States is preserved.11 Federal States ( Bundesstaaten ) and Confederacies ( Staatenbunden ) . The two main types of the composite State are the Confederacy ( Staatenbund ) and the Federal State ( Bundesstaat ) , and a critical examination of the nature of these two forms will serve to bring out the general principles that are applicable in determining the juristic form of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is amply testified to by the great diversity that exists in the views held by different publicists upon the various points involved . Thus , Waitz , Bluntschli , Ruttiman , de Tocqueville , and many American writers , maintain the doctrine of divided sovereignty in a Federal State . As regards the nature of our own union , Wheaton and Halleck and other international law writers declare that the international sovereignty of the ' Thus says Jellinek ( op. cit. , p. 212 ) , " Die Personalunion ensteht durch Momente , welche keine Willenseinigung der Staaten voraussetzen and zur Folge haben , die Realunion hingegen beruht auf dem iibereinstirnmenden , geeinigten Willen der Staaten , welche die Fiille der Staatsgewalt , die Entscheidung fiber die wichtigsten Angelegenheiten der Staaten Finer natiincchen Personlichkeit zuweisen . " In his latest work , Allgemein.e Staatslehre , Dritte Auflage , p. 751 , Jellinek , as to the distinction between Personalunion and Realunion , says , " Die urspriingliche Unterscheidung beider Typen , je nachdem bloss die Person des Monarchen oder iiberdies staatliche Angelegenheiten den einzelnen Staaten gemeinsam seien , die noch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wird , ist auf rein ausserlichen Merkmalen basiert and rechtlich belanglos. " // individual State is destroyed , but domestic sovereignty retained , though it is apparent that in taking this view a conception of sovereignty is taken that makes of it a mere collection of powers so loosely related that they may be separated without loss of real sovereignty to the possessor of any part . According to Twiss , the members of our union though not " independent " are yet " all sov-ereign States . " 12 According to Calhoun and his school , they are completely sovereign ; while by the opponents of that school they are held as entirely devoid of this character . As opposed to complete sovereignty , either of the individual States or of the national government , Brownson holds that , " while the sovereignty is and must be in the States , it is in the States united and not in the States severally .

" 1E Borel , who has given us one of the best discussions of the subject , defines a Federal State as : " un Etat souve-rain , do nt les membres ne sont pas souverains . . . L'Etat federatif est done 1'Etat clans lequel une certaine participation a 1'exercice du pouvoir souverain est ac-cordee a des collectivities inferieures , soit qu'on les ad-joigne a 1'organe souverain pour la formation de la volonte nationale , soit que , prises clans leur totalite elles forment elles-meme cet organe souverain. " 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would serve any good purpose . The point has , however , been made sufficiently plain that , upon this most important topic of public law , an almost chaos of thought reigns . The explanation for this must be that there has not been a proper analysis of the problem as a purely juristic one . We shall therefore be justified if we consider this question with some degree of particularity . Preliminary Propositions . As an introduction to this examination it will be well to repeat certain of the propositions which have been already established and which will furnish the premises of our argument . These are : 1 . That sovereignty signifies the legal competence of the State to determine its own legal rights and obligations as well as those of all persons , natural and artificial , over whom it claims jurisdiction . 2 . That sovereignty , thus denoting the legally omnipotent will of the State , is indivisible and inalienable . 3 . That two or more States , each possessing this sovereignty or legal omnipotence , can not enter into relations with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a topic which will be more fully discussed in a later chapter , but it is sufficient here to say that inasmuch as a law , in sense strictiore , imports a command from a legal superior to a legal inferior , it can not apply to relations between two or more sovereign states which stand towards one another as equals . They can enter into agreements that create moral or political but not legal obligations . 4 . From this third proposition it follows , as has been shown in an earlier chapter , that a sovereign State can not be created through the joint action of two or more previously existing sovereign States . In other words , sovereignty can not be the product of a treaty . These principles being established , it is clear that , when dealing with political groups composed of two or // more bodies-politic terming themselves States , 18 but two possible juristic alternatives are presented . Either the central or so-called federal body possesses the sovereignty , in which case the federated units are wholly without sov-ereignty ; or these federated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is wholly with-out this attribute . If , then , we give the name Fed-eration or Federal Union or Federal State ( Bundesstaat ) to the first of these forms , and to the second the name Confederation or Confederacy ( Staatenbund ) , we find that these two political types stand almost poles apart from one another . They are not different species of the same genus , but are juristically antithetical to each other . Confederacies . In a Confederation the member States retain their full sovereignty and legal independence and , strictly speaking , no central State is created . There is a common or central government but no central sover-eignty . The central government is thus nothing more than the common organ or complexus of organs which the severally sovereign States establish and maintain for the carrying out of purposes with reference to which these States have agreed to act as a unit . This central govern-ment may thus be viewed as , in effect , a branch of the government of each of the associated States , and all the authority that it exercises as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defines the powers of the central government and the corresponding obliga-tions of the States may be known as a Constitution , but , accurately speaking , it is nothing more than a treaty or compact between the States , and derives its validity from their consent to it . This being the juristic nature of a confederacy , any member State may withdraw from it without being // chargeable with the commission of an illegal act , and this is so even though the articles of confederation may provide for a perpetual union . Such a withdrawal by one or more States may be a violation of international good faith and furnish serious grounds for complaint upon the part of the States remaining within the confed-eration , but it can not be properly asserted by them that the secession is an illegal or unconstitutional act . Distinct from the right of secession is the claim some-times put forth that , in a confederacy , each member State retains the right to determine whether or not it will permit the enforcement within its limits of those orders of the central government which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized by the constitution or articles of union . This is known as the doctrine of Nullification . Here again it may be said that , inasmuch as each State is admitted to be legally sovereign , it can not be held to act illegally if it refuse obedience to orders of which it disapproves . But such a disobedience , unless expressly recognized by the articles of union , is necessarily a breach of those articles ; and , furthermore , the assertion of the right is , in itself , an unreasonable one , for , if exercised , the effect is to allow a State to remain in the confedera-tion and obtain all the advantages flowing from it while at the same time refusing to abide by such special com-mands as happen to be onerous or otherwise objection-able to itself . The claim of a right of nullification is thus , in some ways , a more extreme claim than is the assertion of a right of secession from the Union.19 Among the more important examples of confederacies may be mentioned the old German Union which lasted // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pact of 1815 ( 1815 to 1840 ) , and the Union of the former American Colonies from 1781 to 1789 under the Articles of Confederation . Federal States . As distinguished from a confederacy , a federal State ( Bundesstaat ) connotes the existence of a true central sovereign State , composed of constituent States which are not themselves severally sovereign . There are some jurists who deny that these constituent bodies-politic may be properly termed States , but in common speech they are usually spoken of as such , and the question whether or not this is technically correct , from a juristic standpoint , will , for the present , be postponed . The central government of a federal State , being conceived of as the organ of a true central State , is not to be regarded as the common organ through which the member States of the Union realize certain of their individual ends . Rather , the reverse is the case , for the central State , being admittedly sovereign , and the member States not sovereign , their governments may properly be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the several areas of the nonsovereign member States . The federal State is thus to be viewed as deriving its authority from its own inherent sovereignty and not by way of delegation from the member States . It may , indeed , be the historical fact that the Union was established at the common desire and by the joint cooperation of these States , but , if it be conceded that a national sovereignty exists , it is irrelevant , legally speaking , how this was brought about . The constitutional result is that the member States may no longer be viewed as themselves sovereign and upon a constitutional level with the NaI io n al State . // Federal States and Confederacies Distinguished . In the Federal State , then , a , true central State is created , its several units are legally and constitutionally united , and sovereignty ? the power of ultimately determining one 's own legal competence ? resides in the federal body . In the Confederacy , on the other hand , the individual States retain their character as States , and their relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conse-quently no central State is created , and sovereignty lies wholly within such individual political units . What union there is in the Confederacy is the creation of the wills of the individual States . In a Federal State , on the other hand , its foundation rests in itself . It is created by the people as a whole , and the individual States are creations of its will . In the case of a Federal State , his-torically founded upon a union of previously existing sov-ereign States , one is to consider the citizens of the Federal State as first divesting themselves of their old State Sovereignties , and then , as a People , establishing a na-tional Federal State . These two volitional acts may be synchronous and made apparent by a single outward act , viz. , the establishment of a federal control , but they are distinct acts from a political standpoint . The apparent continued existence in the Federal States of what were formerly independent political bodies , is not real . Those bodies-politic are destroyed when their citizens transfer their allegiance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal constitution . They are thus creations of the Federal State , and , as Lincoln said in his first message to Congress , " The States have their status in the Union and they have no other legal status . The Union is older than any of the States , and in fact created them as States . " 2 ? // Thus , if we take the position that a national State was created by the American people in 1789 , we must consider them to have become a psychologically united People before that time and to have destroyed their former individual States when they established the present Federal States . This being so , the fact that the constitution was adopted by conventions convened in what had formerly been the several States , must be interpreted as meaning merely that a united People saw fit , for the sake of convenience and expediency , to utilize existing governmental machinery and territorial divisions for the formal adoption of its new constitution . And that therefore such conventions were , in fact , Federal and not State organs . Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his words deserve quotation . He says : " A composite ( federal ) state , and a system of confederated states , are broadly distinguished by the following differences . In the case of a composite state , the several united societies are one independent society , or are severally subject to one sovereign body ; which , through its minister , the general government , and through subdivisions , may be cited the following quotation from an address by Lincoln to the Legislature at Indianapolis , February 12 , 1861 . " In what consists the special sacredness of a State ? I speak not of the position assigned to a State in the Union by the Constitutions ; for that , by the bond , we all recognize . That position , however , a State can not carry out of the Union with it . I speak of that assumed primary right of a State to rule all which is less than itself , and ruin all which is larger than itself . If a State and a county in a given case should be equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants , in what , as a matter of principle , is the State better than the county ? Would an exchange of names be an exchange of rights upon principle ? On what rightful principle may a State , being no more than one-fiftieth part of the nation in soil and population , break up the nation , and then coerce a proportionately larger subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way ? What mysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district or county , with its people , by merely calling it a State ? " From what has been said in this chapter it would follow that ascription of " limited sovereignty " to the members of our Union by American courts and Congress is , strictly speaking , incorrect . A more proper phrase would be that of " limited legal competence . " // its members and ministers the several united governments , is habitually and generally obeyed in each of the united societies , and also in the larger society arising from the union of all . In the case of a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one society , and are not subject to a common sovereign ; or ( changing the phrase ) each of the several societies is an independent and political society , and each of their several governments is properly sovereign or supreme . Though the aggregate of the several governments was the framer of the federal compact , and may subsequently pass resolutions concerning the entire confederacy , neither the terms of that compact , nor such subsequent resolutions , are enforced in any of the societies by the authority of that aggregate body . To each of the confederated governments , these terms and resolutions are merely articles of agreement which it spontaneously adopts ; and they owe their legal effect , in its own political society , to laws and other commands which it makes or fashions upon them , and which , of its own authority , it addressed to its own subjects . In short , a system of confederated states is not essentially different from a number of independent governments connected by an ordinary alliance . And where independent governments are connected by an ordinary alliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments considered as an aggregate body ; though each of the allied governments adopts the terms of the alliance , and commonly enforces those terms , by laws and commands of its own , in its own independent community . Indeed , a system of confederated states , and a number of independent governments connected by an ordinary alliance , can not be distinguished precisely through general or abstract expressions . So long as we abide in general expressions , we can only affirm , generally and vaguely , that the compact of the former is intended // to be temporary ; and that the ends or purposes which are embraced by the compact are commonly more numerous , and are commonly more complicated , than those which the alliance contemplates. " 21 Distinctions Improperly Made . The analysis of the Federal State as thus far conducted enables us , by way of negative criticism , to point out the invalidity of the fol-lowing criteria that have at times been applied in dis-tinguishing the Staatenbund and Bundesstaat . First , the distinction does not lie in the amount of powers actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the individual States . As long as the governments of the individual members of the union are considered as parts of the central government , no essential distinction can arise regarding the distribution and actual exercise of its powers . Sovereignty con-sists not so much in the actual and immediate exercise of functions as in the power potentially possessed to draw to oneself those particular powers that may be seen fit . Federal States may be conceived in which but very few functions are centrally exercised ; and , on the other hand , Confederacies imagined , in which the powers of the central government are most ample . But in neither case is the political character of the union thus determined . Secondly , the distinction between these two political types does not consist in the fact that in the Federal State the operation of federal law is in all cases , directly upon individuals , while , in the Confederacy , the acts of the central power apply to the States as such and through them to their citizens . It is true that the Federal State must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the execution of its laws , but it is pntirely possible that the Federal State may , in some // instances at least , operate through the individual States as such . Also , vice versa , in the Confederation law may operate in some instances directly upon the individual . Thus , while Americans have been accustomed to distinguish the present Union from that maintained under the Articles of Confederation upon this ground , as a matter of fact this rule does not hold good in all cases . As Madison points out in the Federalist : 22 " In some instances , as has been shown , the powers of the new government will act on the States in their collective characters . In some in-stances also , those of the existing government act imme-diately on individuals . In cases of capture ; of piracy ; of the postoffice ; or coins ; weights , and measures ; or trade with the Indians ; of claims under grants of land , by dif-ferent States ; and above all , in the case of trials by courts-martial in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the intervention of a jury , or even of a civil magistrate ; in all these cases the powers of the confederation operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual citizens . " In fact , then , provided the Federal State has the direct , or primary allegiance of the governed , the exact means through which laws are executed is not juristically sig-nificant . The essential point is as to whose will is em-bodied in them . Political expediency demands that the greater and more important functions of the Federal State should be performed through its own central organs rather than through those political bodies in which there rest historical traditions of complete Sovereignty and national autonomy , and a jealousy of over control by the central power . If the Federal State trusts too much to such particular organs there is the danger of its commands being less faithfully performed than they would be by its
