The modern theatre began as a form for sermons as it is now a subject for them . Processions , pageants , performances - this was a slow , natural sequence . Not be fore the 1 5th century did audiences , growing more interested in the character of the customary devil than that of Christ , cause these moralities to lose their holy character . Dramatic interpretations of the gospels are not yet without their spiritual value . Last week , in Canterbury Cathedral at Canterbury , England , there was performed The Coming of Christ , a nativity play written in the antique tradition by famed Poet John Masefield . <P> The performances occupied one hour and twenty minutes each . The first episode attempted to present the paradisiacal scenes in which Christ announced his intentions of coming to earth . Next were shown the three kings , each an allegorical figure ; last the shepherds , of whom some talked labor dissatisfaction until the chief shepherd knocked their heads together and they all went to bow down at the creche in which Jesus lay , squealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherds ' communistic conversation caused certain punctilious critics to condemn the performance as presented in a consecrated house and one which had , incidentally , never been used for morality plays in the middle ages . Poet Masefield replied : " Would you have the shepherds talk about foot and mouth disease ? " The play was accordingly produced with accompanying music by Gustav Hoist , with costumes designed by Charles Ricketts .
