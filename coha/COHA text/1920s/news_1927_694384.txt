txt Cluett , Peabody &; Co. , after maintaining its earnings at a stable but practically stationary level for several years , has engaged in a new program of economies and expansion expected materially to increase profits in the long rum Three new plants are being started at strategic points and the management has concentrated on cutting down the time required in manufacturing , reducing inventories and speeding up turnover , all of which will cut down costs and free a considerable portion of working capital hitherto tied up . In the six months ended June 30 net profit was $1,199 , - 149 , equal after dividends on the $6,000,000 7% preferred stock , to $5.17 a share on the 192,391 shares of no par common outstanding .

Reduction of inventories to $6,355,157 at the end Of 1926 , from $9,942,256 in 1925 and $12,367,993 in 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company on a more profitable footing . The direct reflection of this liquidation is seen in the reduction of the preferred stock to $5,950,000 at the end of 1926 , from $9,000,000 in 1925 . There are now 7,000 more shares of preferred in the treasury from operation of the sinking fund , which reduces the amount outstanding to $5,300,000 . Improvement in liquid position is seen in the increase in cash and call loans to $2,369,961 as of June 30 , 1927 , against $1,3S0,12S in December . Current liabilities in June totaled $43S,009 . Three new plants are planned to develop to the fullest extent three important markets distant from the main plant at Troy , N. Y. A shirt , underwear and handkerchief plant has been leased near Atlanta , Ga. , which has the advantage of being near cloth mills and raw material markets , and in a favorable position for shipments to Middle West as well as growing Southern markets . Development of fine goods production in the South in recent years has made the opening of this plant possible . Production has been started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to develop intensively the cheaper Canadian shirt business not supplied by the company 's main plants . This field is an important one and hi development will eventually add considerably to profits . The new Cuban plant is primarily for the purpose of saving the expense of the Cuban tariff . The type of shirts sold in Cuba is so different from those in demand in this country that a separate plant there will be better adapted . forhandlingratatruarket . Fabrics made in Europe are largely used . IMPORTANT* OPERATING ECONOMIES MADE It has been found possible to make important operating economies particularly in cutting down the time goods are held in the factory , thus reducing the time working capital is tied up . Time &equired; for making collars and shirts has been reduced about 50% and further economies are expected . The management is applying some of thci modern " straight line " methods of production perfected in the motor industry to the production of its products . The adaptation of this time saving principle gives evidence of greatly increasing operating efficiency . Cluett Peabody has been faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demand for stiff collars which originally were the principal department of the business . In the last few years the vogue of the soft collar and of shirts with collars to snatch has seriously cut into the business in plain stiff white collars . While adapting itself to this change in styles , Cluett has been steadily building up its business in all types of shirts and also in underwear and handkerchiefs so that now the collar business forms only about 50% of the whole . It is felt there is room for considerably more expansion in the shirt business . There are indications the tide has turned toward the stiff collar for business wear , and the company , by advertising campaigns , is promoting this trend as much as possible . The development of this style change would be an important factor in increasing sales . Meanwhile expansion in other profitable fields is going on steadily .
