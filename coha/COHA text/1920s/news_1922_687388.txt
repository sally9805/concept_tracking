txt MORE ABOUT GOMEZ . Tells of " Unspeakable Crimes " Under Present Venezuelan Regime . To the Editor of The New York Times : The letter which appears from the pen of a self-styled Venezuelan in your issue of last Friday under the title " Gomez in Venezuela " offers , in my judgment , no argument against the accusations which I made regarding crimes committed ' in Venezuelan prisons . Your correspondent has probably no relatives or friends who have Bled in them , as has been my experience . During his long absence from his native country he has undoubtedly lost all interest in what happens there socially and politically . The news that I imparted to you , however , in my letter of the 11th has unt fortunately turned out to be partly false , because there are still in our prisons many political prisoners who are kept there , notwithstanding the promulgation of their freedom by official decree . I pave just received information that of the enormous number of prisoners there are hundreds who are yet suffering in our dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with money by their families , but it is systematically kept by the hirelings of the tyrant , who feed them air . That is the , reason why many die of hunger , as happened to my brother , and to all of them it is a feast to gather from the passing sewers the skins of bananas and other fruits which are thrown - there by the troops guarding them . This state of things , notwithstanding the opinion of heartless merchants , can not continue indefinitely . New PresiVientialn elections must take place next April , and under the dictator 's sway they can not be fair . If the American republics desire to prevent bloodshed , as the sole means the Venezuelan people have for remedying the appalling condi ' lions , it will be necessary that the next illegal term be not recognized , for it signifies a continuation of Gomez and his unspeakable crimes .

The reference to the chaste monogamous tiger was a jocular one , and . while perhaps somewhat lacking in subtlety , was , I thought , protected by its obviousness from raisurslerstind .

WILLIAM AlcADOO . New York , Feb. 1 , It22 . Opportunities on Pacific Coast . To the , E'ditor of The New York Times : People on the Coast read continually of the great number of unemployed people in the Eastern States and frequently express surprise that they do ' not come to the Pacific Coast , where labor , including domestic help , is so scarce and wages high beyond reason . While the Eastern part of the United States is straining under difficulties of finance , the Pacific Coast is on a boom reminding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Easterner I suggest that you direct your labor boards ' attention to the suggestion for investigation and possible action .
