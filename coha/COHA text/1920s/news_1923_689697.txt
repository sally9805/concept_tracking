txt Is the end of all things at hand ? The Fundamentalist brethren think so , and there are plenty of signs and portents to encourage them . Who would have supposed that Texas would be the centre of doctrinal controversy in the more or less Catholie Protestant Episcopal Church , with Dallas figuring as the Cluny of our time ? Stranger still is the charge that the Episcopalian Fundamentalists of Texas are dominated by a Baptist Fundamentalist , Dr. Frank Norris . A Baptist is the protagonist of the Catholic tradition : a gentleman who spends most of his time sentencing his Baptist brethren to hell in showing the Episcopalians the way to heaven . Now It Can Be Told . From The World , Dec. 18 . Hans Wagner , one of the greatest hitters of all time , tells tomorrow the secret of ois success in batting . From The World , Dec. 19 .

The week 's Pulitzer Prize for Comedy goes to Congressman Willie Upshaw of Georgia . who announces that he would n't run for'Vice President with Al Smith as Presidential candidate . The Pulitzer Prize for Thoroughness , however , is awarded to a resthuratrice on the Hoboken waterfront , who served a customer doped coffee , took all the money in his Pocketbook and all the clothes in his suitcase , extracted his gold tooth and then sent him a bill for room rent . The Episcopal House of Bishops , or some other body used to laying down the law . would do a great service by maaing an authoritative pronouncement on the urgent question of woreza in smoking ears . Only the toughest and most hide-bound reactionary Would cteny that a woman who wants to smoke has a right to a place in the smoker ; but the great issue , the question on which we must have a decision by somebody qualified to decide . is whether women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the members of the Woman 's Party would say they have Just as much right there as men who are n't smoking . But have they ? Is it a mere superstition , this ancient custom which regards the smoking ear not as a place where people smoke , but a sort of men 's retreat from feminine encroachments ? There are men who slip into the smoker not because they want to smoke , but because they have supposed that there alone they would be in no danger of having to give up their seats to ladies overburdened with Christmas bundles . , A lady who comes into the smoker to smote , it was generally understood , being there for her own pleasure , had no special claim on a. man 's chivalry . But a lady who comes in , by implication , only because the other cars are too full to stand in , virtually throws herself on the generosity of the men who have hunted the smoker expressly in order to escape her . Perhaps this is out of the jurisdiction of the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may claim it as falling within its field , to judge from Dr. Straton 's remark that " when a rector of a great church lights a cigarette in the presence of the young women of his congregation and passes it to his wife , I do not care much for his opinion . " How about it , Doctor ? You 've told us about the- fires of hell ; what of the smoke of the smoker ? The Age of Transportation . Thinkers tell us that the fundamental social difference between our times and those that have gone before is that we have acquired mobility . What this means was illustrated in our city on Friday afternoon , when the largest liner in the world was stuck in the mud in the bay ; a hundred thousand passengers were tied up in subway trains , motionless because of a power-house accident : and not less than 247.083 citizens sat in taxis , caught in traffic jams , and wondered why they had n't walked . The Christmas book advertising being out of the way , the pessimists have room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Review . The leading pessimizer is Hamlin Garland , who thinks that the world is going to the devil and that New York is giving it a shove whenever necessary . Among the things that Mr. Garland views with alarm are most novels . most movies , most girls , all bobbed hair , all lipsticks , modern dances , flesh-colored stockings and cigarettes . Evidently we are headed for perdition and the only thing that can save us is a censorship . Mr. Garland admits that censors often make mistakes , but they are cheap at the price ? any price . All this is very alarming , yet it was ' old stuff at least two thousand years before Tut-ankh-Amen . And perhaps the world ' is not so bad as it might be , if after fins thousand years of steady deterioration it can still produce virtuous gentlemen like Hamlin Garland who regard the color of stockings as a major issue .

On Tuesday William Randolph Hearst testified that he knew his employe C. F. Zittel was a bribe-taker , but that he still , , kept him ' on the payroll at $1,000 a week ; and on Wednesday morning 032.753 citizens read that in the papers and remarked , " Gosh . I 'd like to work for Hearst . " The Evening Post boils with righteous wrath about the high cost of theatre tickets and the fact that several persons must get their percentage out of tf/e price you pay the speculator . But granted that the difference between the $3.30 you would pay at the box office , if you could get tickets at the box office , and the ten or twelve dollars you actually do pay if you want them so badly , goes to the support of theatre treasurers and sub-contracting speculators and various other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live somehow , and if they did n't slack blood from amusement-seekers they would merely be cluttering up , some already oiercrowded industry . Make them do something productive , you say ? What ? Send them back to the farm , perhaps , to grow more crops that will rot in the fields or be sacrificed below cost . No. the extra , dollars in the final price of your theatre seats are merely a super-amusement tax for the relief of unemployment . As much Could be said for the high price of liquor ; the economic benefits of prohibition ' have been immense , because more men than betore get their cut out of the price ? of every bottle as it passes from importer to consumer . Of course , it is hard en those , of us " who work for a living ; but we do n't have to buy smuggled rum , or theatre tickets , and we ought to be thankful that this one tax , at any rate , can be evaded by mere refusal to pay it .
