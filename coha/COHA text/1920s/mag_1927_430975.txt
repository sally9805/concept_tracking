 | WHEN an Irishman looks at his country from a distance , as from America or Australia , the exact size of the country is apt to disappoint him . The longest line of land which can be drawn is three hundred miles : from Fair Head , in the northeast , to Mizen Head , in the southwest . Taking the country as a rough lozenge , the short diagonal from northwest to southeast is about two hundred miles ( see map , page 262 ) . The terrain itself may be roughly divided into three parts : a mountainous region in the north , an equally mountainous region in the south , and a great central plain . The mountains in the north of Ireland are a geological continuation of those of Scotland , and those of the south a like continuation of the Welsh mountains . The Irish Central Plain is opposite what in England is called by soldiers the Chester Gap , and so , naturally , the Irish Central Plain is England 's logical and only military outlet to the northwest . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invade Ireland as it is for a human being to turn from left to right . TARA ONCE THE SEAT OF IRISH KINGS The rich and fertile province of Meath was the possession of whatever tribe in Ireland could take and hold it . In earliest days Dublin and its Li Ffev was not the principal site of the Irish kings , but Tara , in Meath , and the Boyne , with its holms of lush meadow grass , its infinity of salmon . In the southwest Limerick was hardly less important . Limerick was protected on the west by the Atlantic and on the east by the wide and dangerous Shannon . The Shannon is considered the real military frontier of Ireland in the west . The greatest of English soldiers , the Lord Protector Cromwell , did not dare to invade Connacht ( Connaught ) . I suppose that to an anthropologist the smallest gesture of a man reveals the soul within him ? that is , if anthropologists believe in a soul , which I do not know . I have never met an anthropologist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle for us Irish to see . We will stupidly go on believing that kindness is not begotten by logic , nor heroism a product of carbohydrates . Assume with me , to avoid argument , that folk have souls , and I will attempt to show you what is back of our race . " Fine words , " says the English proverb. " butter no bread . " But I distrust the ultimate wisdom of a race which evolved that miracle of huckstering : " Honesty is the best policy . " " When gentlefolk meet , compliments are exchanged , " say the Chinese . Our " Go inaucc Icca git ! " " God bless you , " " Jcea is ill ? ' irra git ! " " God and Mary bless you ! " mean so infinitely more than " I low do you do ' " A GIVING , LOYAL , PEOPLE Even in English , our people saying good-bye to a friend will always add , " God bless you ! " There is no assumption of courtesy . It is there inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aran Islander ? than , indeed , any Irish peasant . When they are young they are supple as a larch . When they are old they have the kindness and sanity of a gnarled apple tree . Always , your trouble is their trouble and your joy theirs . We are a giving people . Irish servants have a pathetic loyalty . They are often of a carelessness which drives a sane man mad . But no tonguethrashing will affect them . They will say : " Ah , sure , himself does n't mean a word of it ! ' T is only a gray day in his heart . " The only discipline you can use is to forbear speaking to them for some days . This is torture . IRELAND 'S PLACE NAMES HAVE COLOR AND CHARM The names folk give to places are an index to their imaginations . In " Valladolid " and " Toledo , " in the " Rue des Petits Champs , " you get names like a bar of music . All names of places meant something to their nominators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what they meant is forgotten . Our names are still alive in Irish speech . Aderg means the Red fiord ; Aghleim , the Horses ' Leap ; Annaghgod , the Marsh of Sally Trees ; Ballynagovna , the Town of the Artificers ; Ballinhoe , the Town of the Mist ; Ballin Tour , the Town of the Bleaching Green ; Bacloughadalla , the Town of the Lake of Two Swans ; Ballyderown , the Town between Two Rivers ; Ballykeen , the Pleasant Townland ; Ballynabragget , the Town of the Ale ; Booleynasruhaun , the Milking Place of the Little Strearils ; Breaghey , the Plain of Wolves ; Bennanilra , the Remote Place of the Eagle ; Cahirnamallaght , the Fort of Cursing ; Caherapheepa , the Fortress of the Fairy Piping ; Carkfree , the District of the Grouse ; Carrigataha , the Rock of the Swarming Bees ; Clogheracullion , the Stony Place of the Holly Bushes ; Clonman , the Meadow of Fruit ; Carraghatork , the Moor of the Hawk ; Derrynablaha.  | the Oak Grove of the Blossoms ; Drimminoweelaun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hanging ; Inchbofin , the Meadow of the White Cow ; Killabrick , the Wood of the Badger ; iIallyree , the Little Hills of Heather ; Moneenatieve , the Little Bog of Rushes ; Poulnaglog , the Hole of Bells , a deep hole in Clare , where the Bells of Drumcliff Abbey are supposed to be buried ; Rathnaglye , the Fortress of Shouting ; Scartnamacagh , the Thicket of the Beggars ; Scartanore , the Thicket of Gold ? the Danes are supposed to have buried much treasure in it ; Slieve Mish , the Mountain of Phantoms ; Taghshinny , the House of the Fox ; Tabernadroaa , the Well of the Druids ; Tullyval , the Hill of Honey ; Vinegar Hill is a corruption of Fidh-nagcaer , or Hill of Berries . This quick imagination , this apt use of words , follows us into English . Our mountainy people and our folk of the sea still think in Gaelic , though they have forgotten the tongue . How often have I heard people laugh at a countryman who says , instead of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " translating the beautiful emphatic conditional of " liLa ' s rind e , " " If it be a fact , " clumsily into English . Our use of prepositions is amazing and subtle . We say , " Glory be to God ! it 's the fine day that 's in it ! " " Ta ionn . " And that denotes a space of time , a certain space out of the infinite , like a meteorite in the multitude of stars . Possessions are things that " at you . " " There is no silver at me , " a man will say if he is penniless . There you see the dignified human entity with possessions at his feet , but not intermingling with his personality . Any sort of suffering is " on us . " There you have the entity , still absolute , with a load or oppression . IRISH BULLS OFTEN REFLECT EFFORTS AT SUBTLE NUANCES OF SPEECH Many of our " Irish bulls , " as our Saxon neighbors insist on calling them , are a result of trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many others are the invention of that rogue and ruffian , the Dublin jaunting car driver . I heard an old Irish groom say , at a trial of races , " If that colt could catch the other , he 'd beat him ! " Considering iVHENCE I WAS HEWN 263 that the two-year-old was five lengths behind at the time , it was surely as ridiculous an assertion as was ever made . Everyone laughed . But I knew what he meant . The two-year-old had gameness , speed , and strength , but did not know how to use them . The boy up could not help him . The statement of Sir Boyle Roche , that " a man ca n't be in two places at the same time , barring he 's a bird of the air , " expresses a great deal . But all it evokes usually is the loud laugh that Oliver Goldsmith knew . INTRICACIES OF GAELIC POETRY This subtlety of Gaelic speech defeats its own ends rather in our poetry . What with alliteration , internal rhymes ? there are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a work as intricate as chess . And one is rather amazed at the artifice than moved by the sentiment . George Fox 's translation of the country poem , the County of Mayo , gives an idea of the heartbreak underlying most Irish verse . It is a straight and somewhat facile translation : On the deck of Patrick Lynch 's boat I sit in woeful flight , Through my sighing all the livelong day and weeping all the night , Were it not that from my people full of sorrow forth I go , By the blessed sun ! ' t is royally I 'd sing thy praise , Mayo ! ' T is my grief that Patrick Laughlin is not Earl of Irrul still , And that Brian Duff no longer rules as lord upon the hill , And that Colonel Hugh MacGrady should be lying dead and low , And I sailing , sailing swiftly from the County of Mayo . An anonymous country bard , trying his hand at English , has got into that tongue a hint of the rhyme and rhythm of Gaelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there you 'd see the jockeys , and they mounted on most stately , The pink and blue , the red and green , the emblem of our nation . . When the bell was rung for starting , the horses seemed impatient , Though they never stood on ground , their speed was so amazing . There was half a million people there , of all denominations ?  | The Catholic , the Protestant , the Jew , the Prespetarian ; There was yet no animosity , no matter what persuasion , But welcome and hospitality , inducing fresh acquaintance . A hint of the intricate vowel rhyming of the Irish bards is in a beautiful translation by one of our two greatest poets , Douglas Hyde : Though riders be thrown in black disgrace , Yet I mount for the race of my life with pride ; May I keep to the track , may I fall not back , And judge me , 0 Christ , as I ride my ride . BLACK DESPAIR WAILS PROM IRISH PIPES Though we have so much pleasant courtesy , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has listened to the Irish elbow pipes knows . The harp , with the beautiful airs of the " Coolin " and " The Blackthorn Bush , " and those others which the poetry of Thomas Moore has made known , is nostalgic , yet often have I been thrown into the darkest of despair by the magic of the Irish pipes , the bare , desolate mountains of Connemara rising before me , and a cold wind blowing from the Pole . Our pipe is not the Scottish pipe , but a small instrument of many keys , played on the knees with a bellows . In the " Lament for Patrick Sarsfield , " as played by old men , the shrill keen is too much for one . And let none think all our stories are of little people , of leprechauns in red caps cobbling small shoes . The most terrible demon in Europe is the Irish Robert Artisson , who was the familiar of the dreadful Lady Alice Kyteler of Kilkenny , foulest of witches . Our Bankeentha , woman of wailing , as the banshee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither is it a romantic fact , but a terrible one . The stories of Garrett Oge , young Gerald , Eleventh Earl of Kildare , called the Wizard Earl , are known to the Fitzgerald  | family to be as full of horror and as fearsome as that mystery of Glamis Castle . In a house in the Boyne Valley a skeleton climbs the wall like a huge spider . The Gormanstown foxes are too well authenticated to leave any doubt about them . THE WORST HAUNTED HOUSE IN THE BRITISH ISLES The worst haunted house in the British Isles is a certain castle in the heart of Ireland . The place is grim and hare , a square castle of the usual type . The top story of the central tower is the chapel , having evidently served that purpose in time past . Often at night the place seems lit up by innumerable candles , and no member of the family or no servant will enter that room unaccompanied . Of the ghosts , one is a monk with tonsure , who walks in at one window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little old man in a green cutaway coat , knee breeches and buckled shoes . But the worst ghost in the world is there , the terrible and well-known It . Here is a description of it from the lady of the house : " I was standing one evening in the minstrels ' gallery , leaning on the balustrade and looking into the hall . I felt suddenly two hands laid on my shoulders .  | I turned around and saw It beside me . It was human in shape and about four feet high . The eyes were like two black holes in the face and the whole figure seemed as if it were made of gray cottonwool , while it was accompanied by a most appalling stench , such as would come from a decaying human body . " Her health was in the balance for a long time . It has been seen many times . The most recent victim is a clergyman , who sought to lay It . He is in St. John of God 's near Dublin , an asylum for the wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gainsaid . The Reverend St. J o h n Seymour , as 1 e v e 1-headed a cleric as exists , and former Inspector Neligan , of the Royal Irish Constabulary , are my authorities . It is always a matter of interest and wonder why the Romans never subjugated Ireland . In his geography , Strabo passes over Ireland with a curt phrase . We know , too , that a certain Irish chieftain . whose name ? w e 11 , for his own sake ? is unmentioned , pleaded with Agricola to invade it from Britain : but Agricola did not think the conquest worth the trouble . The truth , I take it . was that there were no cities to conquer . The Irish were an agricultural a n d nomadic race , living in huts of clay and wattles , which m i g h t be deserted without heartbreak and rebuilt with ease . Such crafts as they knew were exercised by slaves taken in warfare or bought in the English market . Such monasteries as were later erected were not of Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome , who brought from their native Tiber the Roman passion for masonry . There was a Paris before Julius Caesar . and there was a London , for we read that in the first century of our era London was burned by Queen Boadicea , and the men of Surrey ; but of Dublin , of Tara . of Limerick , we know little or nothing . A  | relative of my own , disputing with the late Professor Tyrrell , who had said that Ireland had no past , thundered that in that respect the Dark Rosaleen is like every decent woman . That is magnificent , but is not argument . ROMAN MISSIONARIES LAID FOUNDATION OF IRISH CIVILIZATION The truth is that we owe the foundations of civilization firstly to the Roman missionaries , or to English missionaries bred under the eagles of Rome , and secondly to the Danes , who built Dublin and Waterford and left them enduring cities . Of what stock we come it is difficult to say . Histories written in Irish monasteries speak of many invasions of the country : by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Firbolgs , men with bags or bellies , for the Irish word means both ; by the followers of Parthalon , who were all supposed to have died of a plague and whose funeral place is Tallaght , near Dublin . These seem to me to have been some African race who suc-  | combed to the moisture and malaria of the country . The name MacFarlane and MacParland are the only relics of their stay . Doctor Samuel Johnson 's friend , Colonel Vallencey , who wrote a most extraordinary grammar of the Erse tongue , a miracle of beauty as to printing , insisted that the Irish were of Phoenician origin , and that the Erse tongue proved it ? a statement ridiculed by modern scholarship . Ireland was , in the ascendant of the Crescent , raided many times by Barbary pirates ; so that the people of Parthelon may have been from the land that later became Carthage . That we are a Mediterranean people is , I think , accepted by most scientists . We are not as tall as the accepted blond English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is darker ; and we are not a seafaring people , as these folk are . A Greek scriptural commentator , whose name I have forgotten , traces the Apostle Paul 's Galatians to a return of Celtic peoples to the minor Asia . But Colonel Vallencey and my shadowy Greek commentator are not authorities to the poring minds of modern critics . I doubt if they would be even given credit for their daring . One small fact remains in my memory that will cause consternation to my countrymen . Our legendary hero , Cuchulain , who is the patron warrior of our young Irish soldiers , was called , as we read in the Irish sagas , Setanta before he assumed the fighting name of " Hound of Cuala . " Now , the Setantii were that English tribe about Manchester known to Roman historians . Language is to some extent a keynote of nationality . Our native language in Ireland is Gaelic , which appears to be a rough descendant of an original stock of which modern Welsh and modern Breton are the purer blooded . To what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know , but in both languages I can trace words we have in Gaelic . The Welsh " back , " a term of endearment , is the same as our Irish " beg , " meaning " little , " and in Breton " ty , "  | meaning " house " and " ker , " meaning " a house with subsidiary buildings , " are the same as our own words . My education , such as it is , has flown more along the lines of Greek and Latin than of Celtic tongues , so I can speak with no authority on the analogues of Breton and Irish ; but that they are very closely akin is beyond question . My boyhood was spent in those parts of northern Ireland where Gaelic was still spoken ; and , having more curiosity about horses , dogs , and boats than about books , I grew up speaking Irish and English with equal fluency ; so that I know for a certainty how far apart the Celtic and Gaelic tongues are . The Welsh , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales in which English is not understood , and the Cornish language , of which the last speaker died more than an hundred years ago , but of which we have preserved to us a small literature , are unintelligible to an Irishman . BASQUE AND CELTIC ARE NOT RELATED A Highlander and an Islesman of Scotland speak the same Gaelic as I do , as do that remnant of people in the Isle of Man who speak their native Manx . In Manx . spoken now I am told by not more than two hundred people , the dialect is that of the County Down , in Ireland . The High-  | lander and the man of the Hebrides use a less inflected Gaelic than ours . There is a vulgar error , as old writers would say , that the Basque language in the Pyrenees has a relationship to our Celtic tongues , but that is untrue . I know the Basques , and their mysterious speech has no relationship with any known tongue . In that strange book of Victor Hugo 's , L , ' Homme Qui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irishman is supposed to be understood by a Basque ; but that is wrong . Their passion for handball , which is our Irish game . and their look , as of an Aran Islander , have given rise to this belief . But every nation plays a form of ball , and brooding on mountain and sea gives people who are fortunate to have sea and mountain by them that rugged face , that depth in their eyes , that grave courtesy , that distilled simplicity . GAELIC IS A DIFFICULT TONGUE Our Gaelic tongue is difficult to learn , supple as a whip . I know of nothing absolute , such as life , death , religion , which can not be discussed in it with ease . We have three verbs to be ? " is , " " ta , " and " bi " " Is " denotes absolutes , as " is  | Lachtin 's Arm , two gold lunulx . Lea an rioghacht , an laidre , agas an gloir , " " For Thine is the kingdom , the power and the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment , as " Ta an jnhuir ' g a lionadh , " " The sea is at its filling , " or the tide is coming in . " Bi " denotes something that usually takes place at a certain hour , as ' Timm daoinc na gcodladh sa inheadhonoidhche . " " People of sense are asleep at midnight . " We have an intricate inflection of the noun . " Ccann " is head , " cinn " of a head , " cionn , " with a head , " a cheann , " 0 head ! I have never heard a peasant make the smallest mistake with his inflections or his very intricate subjunctive tense . Yet it is a mistake to think that there is any big literature in Erse . Beyond lyrical poetry of a shortness which is not better than any other country 's , and some sketchy histories and geographies , we have nothing . Our big Gaelic work was the martyred Bishop Bedell 's translation of the Bible ; but as that was a translation of the Authorized Version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which clung to the Scriptures as edited in Douai . The famous book of Leinster is a monument of fine clerkly illumination and infantile lives of Saints . MASONS AND ARTICICERS ONCE HAD A SEPARATE LANGUAGE Besides Gaelic , there flourished in Ireland a cryptic speech used by masons , Bcarla eagair nan Saor , " the difficult speech of the artificers . " Only very old  | masons remember it in Ireland and will disclose it to you , mumbling in their white beards and looking suspiciously at you out of red-rimmed , faded eyes . In it were words which you recognize as Latin , but mainly the vocabulary consisted of Irish words reversed . The interesting part of this is : that in England , beside the gypsies , there are tribes of itinerant tinkers who use many of these reversed Irish words in their jargon , which is not Romany . " I , apac " for a horse is the Irish " capon " ; " rohob " English tinkers have otherwise nothing Irish about them . MYSTERY SHROUDS IRELAND AFTER ROME 'S NOBLE RETREAT From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to " cast off ! " from Dover , a dim mist hangs over Great Britain and Ireland . The legions and their eagles fought their way back to Rome ? a terrible and noble retreat . But behind them stayed the Christian missionaries . The struggle of these great-hearted men against Druidism is a story we have lost , or was never told us . In Ireland I doubt if ever there was a great priesthood or following of Druids as there was in England and Brittany . We have nothing in Ireland like Stonehenge or Karnak , or even the small Druidic circles of Cornwall . Our round towers , about which so much has been written , seem to have been bell towers of churches . like the campaniles of Venice . or watchtowers against the Norsemen coming by the sea . The rapid development of Christianity in Ireland is marfor road is the Irish " bohor " ; " cc 's " is the Irish saoi , a magistrate . This dialect is called by themselves " Shelia , which I suppose is " Celtic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints in Ireland , like Columkille and Brigit , and our hermits who lived in their beehive cells were innumerable . They left Ireland for Cornwall , like St. Piran , whose buried oratory is called Perran Zabuloe , or St. Piran in Sabulo , properly " in the sands , " near Newquay ; like St. Mawgan . About these saints there is the legend that they floated across on millstones , which I take to be a vulgarization of the fact that they brought their altar stones with them , containing relics of other holy ones . Brittany gives shelter to St. Briac near Dinard ; to St. Ronan at Lacronon , in Finistere ; to St. Budoc at Plourin ; to St. Fiacre at Le Faouet . The name Fiachar is still a not uncommon name in Ireland . The strange thing about this Irish saint is that he gave his name to the French cab . which might lead some foul . irreverent man to ask whether he , of all the Irish saints , did not float across to Brittany on his altar stone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RICH MONASTERIES ATTRACTED NORSE RAIDERS The monasteries and churches founded by the Irish Christians . such as the great abbey of Clonmacnoise , drew the eyes of the ravaging Norsemen , and under their splendid leader , Thorkils , they made as thorough a conquest of the country as could possibly be imagined . It is a curious fact , but of the coins found in Ireland . there are none minted by Irish kings . Many hear the inscription of Canute and Olaf . " Olaf i divielin , " or Olaf in Dublin .  | The Irish scholar Duald MacFirbis writes of the tenth century : " Erinn was filled with ships , viz , the ships of Birn , the ships of Odvin , the ships of Grifin , the ships of Suatgar , the ships of Lagman , the ships of Earbalbh , " and so on , " the ships of Ingean Roe ( the Red Maiden ) . All the evils which befell Erinn until then were as nothing . . . They used to kill Erinn 's kings and carry her queens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danish scholar Worsaac has given a list of Norse kings of Ireland , cornpiled from Irish records , which extends from 853 in our era until Iaoo ? kings of Dublin , kings of Waterford , kings of Limerick . Many of our place names in Ireland show how extensive the Norse dominion was . The three provinces of Ulster , Leinster , and Munster have the Scandinavian ending stadr or ster . Even Ireland is a Norse form . Eire is our name for our country ; the word land is not in our language . The victory of King Brian over the Norsemen at Clontarf was so complete that MacFirbis says : " and then there was  | not a threshing spot from Howth to Brandon , in Kerry , without an ensclaved Dane threshing on it , nor a quern without a Danish woman grinding on it . " KING BRIAN RID THE ISLAND Or THE NORSE , Norse chroniclers , whose accounts I regret to say are more trustworthy than the vivid histories of the Irish monks , give a more reasonable report of the battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to effect an union with the forces of the king of Leinster , were caught in a thoroughly faulty flank movement by the Irish general . Their cavalry were useless in the foothills , and as they retreated toward Clontarf they were massacred in taking to the sea . The power of the Norsemen in Ireland had been diminishing , owing to internal troubles in the Norse kingdoms and to the lack of new emigrant blood into Ireland . That the victory was thoroughly Irish I dispute , for King Brian , like most Irish chieftains of his time , was so closely interallied with the invaders ' families as to be more than half Norse himself . His rise to power was through the aid of the Scandinavian princes , and his attack on King Sytrig of Dublin seems to have been of an unwarranted treachery . Brian was the father of Teige and Donagh by Kormlod . Kormlod was also married to Anluf , King of Dublin , by whom she bore the more famous Dublin king , Sytrig Silkeskjaag ( Silkbeard ) . Thus Brian 's two sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dublin king Eachmargoch , also a Norseman , were half-brothers of their father 's enemy , King Sytrig . Irish Christianity seems to have had a mollifying effect on the Danes , whereas  | it bent the Irish no whit . The great Norse king , Olaf Trygvason , was baptized by an Irish abbot on the Skellig Isles . An Irish princess , Sanneva , was later held to be a saint in Norway . Her body was deposited over the high altar in Bergen , and on the eighth of July the Norse celebrated an annual mass in her honor . In Iceland there is a fiord named after St. Patrick , on the northwest coast of the island Patreksfjordr . HOW THE BRITISH CAME TO IRELAND On the banishment of Dermot MacMurrough , one of the Irish High kings who followed Brian , he appealed to Henry II of England to help him , offering to become his vassal . Henry gave MacMurrough leave to enlist any subject of his who was willing , and such in plenty the Irish prince found on the Welsh marshes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief adherent . Robert Fitzstephen , Maurice Prendergast , Raymond Fitzgerald , " Le Gros , " were the first to help him . They were steadily followed by a stream of English , Welsh , and Flemish traders . The Norman knights , mercenary soldiers , were given grants of land by the High king in return for their service , and from these lands the Irish clans were unable to evacuate them . The Normans fought with bowmen , followed by mounted infantry , " Izobilers , " in chain armor , and against these the Irish clansmen could not stand . Also , the Normans had considerable military experience against English , Greeks , and Saracens . The Irish had no knowledge of any but guerrilla warfare against the Danish kings . The history of the succeeding centuries is the history of the Normans consolidating their power in Ireland . De Burgo  | in Connaught , De Courcy in Ulster , Fitzgerald and De Lacy in the south . The Normans in Ireland sent quantities of men and treasure to England to assist their liege lord in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their suzerainty in Ireland was benevolent . The Irish chiefs rebelled against them for the same reason that the modern Arab of Syria rebels against the French mandate . LIe objected to strongholds , such as the Normans built ; he objected to the policing of the country ; he objected to any policy which kept him from grazing his cattle where and on whose lands he liked . In the War of Scottish Independence , and after Bannockburn , O'Neill of Ulster invited Edward , Robert Bruce 's brother , to come and be king of Ireland . He was crowned at Carrickfergus , and was terribly defeated and himself killed at Faughart in 1318 . Many of his soldiers did not return to Scotland , but remained in Louth , in Armagh , and Down and Antrim . ELIZABETH RECONQUERED IRELAND Though the Scottish invaders were defeated , yet the victory was so costly as to break the Norman dominion in Ireland . A century and a half later Queen Elizabeth had to reconquer the country . From the Tudor time onward , the history of Ireland becomes definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tudors ' enemies , not so much in a struggle for independence as in a struggle for and against the World  | Power , possibilities of which England was beginning to see in herself . For some time after , the Irish wars split definitely into a religious camp , following the English division of those who believed that the state and religion must march hand in hand , and those who believed that religion must be above the state . Until the Battle of the Boyne , this insoluble problem was uppermost . The first clear bugle note of freedom came in 1798 , when out of America and out of France the idea of independence strode forth startlingly naked and muscular . As to freedom and as to religion , there is no speaking of rights or wrongs .

IRISH PROFIT BY DEFEAT The rebellions of ' 48 and ' 67 were echoes in Ireland of the voice that called to the Hungarians and the Poles ; with both races we have some mysterious bond .

We are a poor country as to money , but we have purple heather and mountains golden with gorse , and rivers , greatbosomed and friendly , where men may dream . And the sea is kind to us .

At Ballyshannon you may be fortunate enough to see the salmon , lying packed like sardines , awaiting the opportune moment to spring up the falls of Assaroe. springing sixteen feet in the air against the foaming , roaring water .  | At Muckross the fantastic cliffs will hold you . In that one named the Market House you will see a blood brother of the rock out of which the African sculptor hewed the fearsome Sphinx . In Donegal you will see the desolate Bosses , a tangle of small lakes and great granite bowlders , and he who loses his way in that desert by night is the most luckless of beings . The great mountain of Donegal is Errigal , and its white cap is not snow but white quartz . From its top , on a fair day , you can see the Scottish Hebrides , Islay and Jura , floating on the water like young brown gulls . LEGEND AND LITERATURE ENHANCE INTEREST OE MANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will emerge the rocky battlements of Tory Island , like something evoked by an enchanter 's wand . The roar of the Atlantic crashing into that cavern known as MacSwine 's Gun will shake the stoutest heart . Belfast is about as Irish a city as Paisley is . It is of no antiquity and , except for commerce , of no importance ; but within easy reach of it are the blue Mourne Mountains , the great Dun of Downpatrick , where the country folk say that St. Patrick , St. Brigit , and St. Columkille are all three buried . Near Castle Upton are some ruined buildings of the Knights Templars , of interest to all Children of the Widow as a minor establishment founded by the Knights who escaped to Harris . At Antrim is the greatest round tower of Ireland , nearly an hundred feet high ( see page 268 ) . Near the town is Lough Neagh , the largest lake in the British Isles , bordered with orchards . At Ballinderry Jeremy Taylor wrote his most important works , and near it , at Whiteabbey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Kilroot , Dean Swift had a living for a small time . North of Belfast , at Larne , where some  | swine named a hamlet Waterloo , begin the Nine Glens of Antrim : Glenarm , Glencloy , Glenariff , Glen Ballyemon , Glenaan , Glencorp , Glendun , Glenshesk , and Glentow . Near Cushendall is Ossian 's grave . Thackeray ( how these English authors will philander after Ireland ! ) called Glenariff a miniature Switzerland . I am certain that no critics of the author of Vanity Fair could arraign him more damnably than does his own phrase . Cushendun was once the home of Moira O'Neill . That beloved poet wrote of Cushendun when she composed her heartbreaking poem of Corrymeela : Over here in England I 'm helping with the hay , And I wisht I was in Ireland the livelong day ; Weary on the English hay , and sorra take the wheat ! Och , Corrymeela and the blue sky over it ! WHERE BRUCE TOOK RETUGE North of Antrim is Rathlin Island , or Raghery , as we of the Gaels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called Sloch-na-inara , or Gullet of the Ocean , and can only he sailed over in the finest of weather . Here is Bruce 's refuge . The author of " Westward Ho ! " compares it to a drowned magpie , a figure over which I have pondered with no success . But then I am only an Irish author . It is a gallant little island , with an immensity of birds . It is mentioned not only by Charles Kingsley , but by Ptolemy . Near Ballycastle is the famous Carricka-Rede , a ropewalk over a chasm sixty feet wide and ninety deep , a couple of planks lashed together by rope . The handrail , also a rope , swings away from you as you cross . Your best help is the Lord 's Prayer . I have seen a glensman carrying a sheep walk across it in a half gale ( see page 270 ) . The Giant 's Causeway , near by , is more curious than beautiful . It is impossible not to think of these basaltic columns as other than artificial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the tessellated terraces are assaulted by a cavalry of foam .

Between Portrush and Derry is Coleraine , meaning the " corner of ferns . " It is the home of Bushmill 's whiskey and possesses one of the finest temperance cafes in the world . RIOT HAS WROUGHT HAVOC IN DUBLIN To speak of Dublin as it is to-day is very difficult . Riot and civil commotion , and the act of the King 's Enemies , and of the King 's Men , have given the " finest city upon the say " a tragic dignity . The ruins of the Custom House , t h e ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ruins , make the heart ache . As to architecture and as to antiquity , these buildings were of little value , but they are unsightly , gangrened wounds now . Great Dublin Castle , with its Birmingham Tower and its Devil 's Half-Acre , is now the Law Courts . The first fortress of the Danes was built here in A. D. 840 . Christ Church still stands in Lord Edward Street . It was the famous Priory of the Holy Trinity , erected by the Danish King Sitric in 1038 . Lambert Simnel was crowned here in 1486 . Near St. Patrick 's Park , in the slums of Dublin , is St. Patrick 's Cathedral , the home of Dean Swift . Museums , zoological gardens , and art galleries are such as any other city has . The Bank of - Ireland Building is the old Parliament House of Dublin , a squat building opposite Trinity College . Dublin is rather a disappointing city , except for its jmemories , which are mostly bitter . To see it at its best one must go on a July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence it seems like a miracle of silver afloat in the summer air . There is a multitude of curious facts about it , from the strange crypt beneath St. Michan 's Church , where bodies will not decay , to the blind river Poddle , that runs through it like the lost rivers of Rome ; to the fact that Jules Verne wrote a novel about it called " Micky Foundling . "  | I can remember it in 1912 , when our hearts were high and we hoped to bring about a Pre-Union Dublin of merriment and enduring dignity . I am afraid it is now a city of despair . Howth is northward , with the small islands of Ireland 's Eve and Lambay . Through Swords and Malahide one travels to Drogheda , whose walls still show the effect of the Lord Protector 's cannon , and whose river , the Boyne , shows so little effect of Ireland 's greatest battle . Westward of Drogheda is Newgrange , famous for its Druid burial mound , with a passage of great stones forty-eight feet long leading into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe . The Norsemen are supposed to have rifled it , so that no man knows what it contained . INTO A WORLD OF GLENS Tallaght , near Dublin , is the great burial place of the legendary legions of Parthelon , who died of the plague . Kings- town is so modern as to be vulgar . Bray and Dalkey are pretty little coast towns . Going into Wicklow , you enter a world of glens , like Glen of the Downs , the Devil 's Glen , and mountain lakes like Tav and Lough Dan . Glendalough , or the " Glen of Two Lakes , " as the Gaelic name means , is a deep , solitary glen in a wild region , the upper lake of which has something terribly sinister about it . Here are the ruins of seven churches , which have stood for upward of twelve hundred years , and a round tower . It is the site of the hermitage of St. Kevin . The Vale of Avoca and the Meeting of the Waters are the prettiest spots in Leinster . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leinster has a feminine , soft quality , to my northern eye . The road from Dublin to Killarney passes through Maryborough and Thurles. in which latter city Silken Thomas , the  | IRELAND : THE ROCK WHENCE I WAS HEWN Earl of Kildare , burned the great cathedral in 1495 because he thought the archbishop was inside . WHERE SPENSER WROTE " THE FEAERIE QUEEN " Near Buttevant is Kilcolman Castle , in which Spenser wrote the first three books of the Faerie Queen . How Norman once that country was is shown by the name of the town which was the battle-cry of the Barrymores : Boutez-en-avant , Push forward ! Spenser 's beautiful city of Cork is almost encircled by the Lee . The name Cork means a marsh , and the city was founded by St. Finbarre in the seventh century , and was later the center of the Danish domination of Munster . It is a city of bridges , and pleasant conversation and disaffection to our Lord the King . It will be remembered that Perkin  | Warbeck got his greatest welcome in Cork . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , its front resembling Bayeux or Rheims . It is a monument of the good feeling which has always existed between Ireland and France . The bells of St. Ann 's inspired Father Prout 's immortal doggerel ( see page 285 ) . Cork has always been beloved of foreigners . Thackeray went into ecstasies over it . The author of " Lorna Doone " wrote a novel called " Shandon Bells , " and Mr. Henry Ford erected a factory for his products here . Near Cork is Queenstown , whose name a polite corporation changed from Cove , in honor of Queen Victoria 's landing . Queenstown is now known officially as Cobh ( see pages 282 and 284 ) . THE ; BLARNEY HOAX Near Cork , too , is Blarney , notorious for two things , the gillaroo trout . " the red fellow , " and a practical joke known as the Blarney Stone , the kissing of which entails the same embarrassment as one suffers through the vulgar devices in amusement parks , in which trapdoors open and you come a purler , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see page 287 and Color Plate VI ) . In Youghal is buried that Countess of Desmond who , when she died , in E6o4 , was one hundred and forty years of age . The place of her commitment is notably haunted . Moeroun Castle , on the Kerry Road , is the birthplace of Admiral Sir William Penn , the father of the founder of Pennsylvania . Gougane Barra is a place of the most dark and beautiful asl ect . Steep mountains and a lake like black marble , and trembling silver rivers shining into the dark water . The kingdom of Kerry is wild and beautiful . Here are the remains , such as they are , of the Druids . Here are the earliest Christian remains . It is a county of semitropical mosses , with some plants that are found nowhere else than in Portugal . It is the home of Irish classical learning , more Latin and Greek having been known in Kerry than in the rest of Ireland combined . Its people are grave and courteous and have pleasant voices . The wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here are the last of the wild red deer . The English poet , William Wordsworth , writing about Killarney , says : " In point of scenery this is the finest portion of the British Isles , " which is treason to his own lake country . The name Killarney means " Church of the sloe bushes . " The lakes are three : the Upper or McCarthy Moore 's Lake ; the Middle or Tore Lake ; the Lower is called in the Gaelic Lough Leane . In the Gap of Dunloe , the brawling Loe River expands into little lakes of water remarkable for their blackness . The Golden MacGillicuddy 's Reeks and the Purple Mountains stand around this district like sentinels ( see pages 290 , 291 ) . Many of the rocks in Lough Leane are called after the chieftain of the district , the O'Donoghue of the Glens . O'Donoghue 's House was blown down during a storm , but his Table , Prison , Pigeon House , and Library still survive . Near by are the ruins of Muckross Abbey , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in its cloisters sixty feet in height . Near Killarney , on the Kenmare Road , is Ross Castle , in the vicinity of which Tennyson wrote part of " The Princess . " Close by the castle is Innisfallen Island , on Lough Leane , " the gem of Killarney , " says Macaulay , " not a reflex of heaven , but a bit of heaven itself . " Its main charms are its holly groves and red-berried rowan trees . The sky in fair weather is blue as Mary 's Cloak . THE MAJESTIC SHANNON IS BEING THROTTLED In the Province of Connacht there is the river Shannon , the broad-bosomed , majestic Shannon , which is being dammed and trained now by the Siemens-Schiickert Company to provide electricity for all Ireland . What a peasant in his cottage wants electric power for , I can not say , and indeed I have not heard anyone ask for it . What industries it is going to serve are unknown . But engineers of the country that produced Einstein , and politicians so mentally able as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . I suppose the explanation is that there is money in it . There is money , too , in  | harnessing a great steeplechaser to a garbage cart hen his racing days are over . There would be money , too , for the Greeks if they made their hallowed Parthenon into an open-air cinema . But in Athens I any assured I should be torn limb from limb were I to suggest it . Limerick is the city of the Danes and Patrick Sarsfield and the landing place of supplies from Hamburg for the furtherance of the Shannon scheme . In Clare are lakes like jewels ? small lakes abounding in trout , and perch , and sad bream , the voracious pike . The names of the small hamlets have a great beauty . Labasheeda , the Bed of Silk ; Clooneenagh , the Solitary Meadow ; Inchicronan , the Island of the Lullaby ; Tinarana , the House of Songs . AMONG CONNEMARA 'S PEAKS Connemara raises in the distance the threatening spears of its mountains spears of purple and black , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you come nearer you find in the Joyce 's Country an unsurpassable beauty of heather , a hospitality unbounded , great courtesy , comeliness of men and women . The bare stretches where the Connaught grouse grows fat and impudent on blaeberries and rowan berries , and the little lakes where the red-billed moorhen bobs courteously through the water as you come near , have a kindliness in them that goes to your heart . Galway , City of the Blakes and Lynches , is the drowsiest , most magical , most Irish , of towns . The peat smoke from the houses assails your nostrils with a necromancy , and the old ache comes in your soul ; and , lookig westward on the ocean , the ache is satisfied , for before you lie the three islands of Aran , in the conger-hunted , herring-wealthy sea . I feel that in describing my country I am anything but a success . Your Dublin journalist could give me two stone and a ten lengths beating over a five-furlong sprint . There is a story , told with great gusto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest who , when listening to some men describing the European capitals , broke in with : " Well , now , gentlemen , do you know : Athy is grand , and Trim is thruly magnificent . " The former local government expert finds an excruciating humor in this remark . But there is something in the dear , simple , old clergyman 's struggle for his country that touches my heart . But the Father need not have worried . No canal in Venice has the soft beauty of the Great Canal that runs from Lough Ree and Athlone to Dublin , going through the Bog of Allen , snowy with canavaun or bog flowers , bearing on its bosom barges of dreams . And the blue Danube of the facile waltz must bow to Anna Liffey , as she comes through Lucan , Patrick Sarsfield 's attainted earldom , toward the sea . The mountains of Dublin . Two-Rock and Three-Rock , the Scalp and Katy Gallagher , bring to my mind " the little hills that are about Jerusalem . " MONUMENTS THAT LEAVE THE HEART COLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leave the heart cold . The bronze statue of the worthy Ferguson , in Derry , is called locally " The Black Man , " so little of romance has it for Derrymen . In Dublin we have a monument to Nelson , and statues of O'Connell and Parnell . But O'Connell said that all the liberty in the world was not worth one drop of human blood . There is a statue in Bayonne , close to the cathedral , in memory of a tailor and a student who fell in the foundation of the Third Republic , and on it are the words , lliorts pour la Libertc . Unconsciously , when I read them , I stood to , as though the Colors were passing . As to Parnell , for all that is written of him , he was a penniless political adventurer to whom Ireland gave a career and a living , and who let down his country for some woman . Irishmen do n't do that . As to Nelson , we welcome him . He had nothing to do with Ireland , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial to Albert , that most virtuous of prince consorts ; but , in God 's name , what did he ever do for Ireland , or even against her , that his Germanic memory should take up one inch of Irish soil ! IRELAND OF THE THATCHED COTTAGE To me Ireland always is the thatched cottage on the mountain side , the thunder of the hunt as it goes for Fairyhouse River , the grave , soft Irish voices . There is even a terrible black beauty about the mountain men as , mad with solitude and drink , they crash through a fair fighting . Even in our fighting we are courteous . We are a warlike nation , but we respect personalities . That story of the returned immigrant who , seeing a certain turbulence in his native town , asked " whether this was a private fight or could anybody join in , " is not as ridiculous as it seems . It is the remark of a gentleman . That the English have done us much evil is a fact I doubt . The grave English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be said on both sides , " is not inapplicable . We have clone some shrewd infighting . But the superior assumption that " Paddy " is a funny fellow , and that his mouth is thick with Irish bulls , is an insolence not to be borne . A remark at which any Englishman will laugh is a phrase I heard from some one in regard to a roystering , gaming , heavy-drinking Irish gentleman who is dead : " ' T is this way , your Honor , himself would n't offend a child ! " Well , who would ? But our friend would go out of his way to preserve the holiness that childhood is . And that is chivalry . When a brown Hand closes on my hand , and the pen drops from my fingers , and the writing is over , if some countryman of mine says as kind a word , it will be sufficient epitaph . We spend our lives seeking to form Ireland . Our poets come down from the mountain tops , crying : I have here a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the streets trying to found a commonwealth more noble than the dream of Plato . Our statesmen rise up with papers in their hands , saying : Here is the New Ireland we have wrought . Let it begin . The old men look at us strangely , with a curious lack of enthusiasm , but they say nothing to hinder us , for they , too , have known these dreams . Life goes on . New dogs go out to challenge for the Waterloo Cup , each , we hope , fleeter than the winner of last year . New horses go gallantly across to Aintree , seeking to win the Grand National . More eternal than the snow of tile Alps is the heather and gorse of Three Rock Mountain . The note of the cuckoo , the droning of the bee , and another foot to the height of great larches is our only measure of time . And suddenly we know our heads are white as bog-flowers . Light comes to us , and we see that we , who thought we were men making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been playing , with that play of childhood that is more serious than the enduring work of masons . THE PASSPORT TO TIR NAN OG Half an hundred moons ; a few more harvests of the mountain ash , and our time is come to leave for Tic nail 0g , to which our passport is that we loved our country . But the thrushes and the wrestling , the poems and greyhounds and chiming rivers of the Assured Land can hardly tear us from her who has given us birth and vision . Herself has to draw us into ) her arms and put a quiet on us . The bells of heather Have ceased ringing their Angelus . Sleepy June weather Has instilled a drug in us . The cry of the plover Is hushed , and the friendly dark Has drawn a blue hood over The meadow lark . We travel sleeping , Over heather hill and through ferny dale , To the Land of No Weeping , Of races , and piping and ale . Husheen ! Husho ! The wind is hid in the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawk is caged in the darkness . The fieldmouse safe in the hay . Now I am in my sleeping , and do n't waken me .
