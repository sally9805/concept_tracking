Sometimes horse flesh is so deftly cooked , so tastily disguised as to be chomped with gusto by U. S. tourists in Paris-chiefly at certain hotels with English or American names and a superfluity of catch-babbitt bathrooms . <P> One such hotel-on the famed Champs Elyses-serves a " New England Corned Beef &; Cabbage Dinner " from splendrous , steam-heated trundle-trays . <P> " C'est du cheval ! " the French maitre d'hotel has confessed privately , " a bit of horseflesh for a people who will eat any meat providing it is ' corned . ' . . . C'est leur propre fourrage ! . . . " * <P> Such unrepentant imposture , although common enough , was not practised last week in Paris , when a banquet consisting chiefly of horse , donkey and mule meat was set before three members of the famed Sacred Union Cabinet of Prime Minister Raymond Poincar . The three , all by way of being gourmets , were : Paul Painlev , mathematician , twice Prime Minister ( 1917 ; 1925 ) ; Minister of Agriculture Henri Queuille ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkins upon expectant laps , the Three Gourmets gazed with approval upon the following <P> Menu <P> Melon Longchamps Consomm de Cheval <P> la Croix <P> ( HorseMeat Clear Soup ) Pat de Foie Gras <P> d'Ane Truff ( Truffled Donkey 's Liver ) <P> Saucisses et Langues de <P> Cheval avec Saucissons de Mulet <P> ( Mixed Grill of Horse Sausages and Horse <P> Tongue with Mule Bologna ) <P> Salade Chevaleresque <P> Creme d'Auteuil Glac <P> Tous les Fruits <P> As these choice morsels began to appear in noble plentitude , the eyes of the Statesmen-Gourmets were observed to glisten with anticipation . Minister of Agriculture Queuille commented favorably upon both the aroma and the taste of his consomm . Minister of Commerce Bokanowski forked rapidly both saucisses and saucissons . Meanwhile good M. Painlev had consumed a second and then a third portion of the truffled donkey 's liver . <P> When toast time came , M. Painlev raised an approving , effervescent glass to his hosts : The National Horse Industry Association . Their chef had proved , he said , that even meats not generally esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the inspiring information as to how many pounds of horse , donkey and mule meat are annually consumed in France . Subsequent toasts to le cheval , Vane and le mulct were capped , of course , by the final and inevitable " A la Belle France ! " <P> <P> * " That 's their proper fodder ! " *The gourmand may be a mere glutton . The gourmet must possess an ecstatic discrimination among foods similar to the faculty of the dgustateur of wine .
