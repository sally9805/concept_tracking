txt Probably one of the American Telephone 8 : Telegraph Co. ' s greatest achievements in the last year has been the the additional service between this country and England , Scotland and Wales and more recently Mexico , whereby the people of the United States automatically are in communication with 67,000,000 additional subscribers . This is an expansion that carries out the company 's policy in making the world more neighborly . Undoubtedly , as the years pass , more and more countries will be in direct telephonic communication with the United States as a result of the efforts of the Bell System . Besides this achievement the company has been growing in the United States , the net total of new stations this year probably will equal if not surpass 1926 when 781,000 telephones were added to the System . This year 's additions should increase the total to well over 18,000,000 . Earnings per share this year probably will be about the same as last year , when $11.95 a share on an average total of 9,790,262 outstanding shares was shown . Actual revenues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of shares outstanding June 20 was 10,477,970 and will show a larger total at the end of the current year . Thus the company continues to show its ability to keep c.arnings up to its increased capital and earn a comfortable margin over the $9 annual dividend requirements . Approximately 23,000 new shareholders have been added thus far this year to the roster , bringing the total to some 430,000 , among which are 70,000 Bell System employes . Less than of the outstanding stock is held in the names of brokers and there are some 5,000 foreign shareholders . With the stock advancing rapidly to new highs , there has been some recent falling off in the number of new shaieholders . The average shows only a slight diminution , but still it is to be expected in view of the fact the stock has advanced from a low of 1491 ? 1 this year to a recent high of 1611a , the highest price in a quarter of a century . There were 10,177.970 average number of shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their value having risen about $150 , o00,000 in the last three months . There will be no new-tilephiine financing this year , as the company carried over sufficient funds from last year 's stock financing to care for its needs . At the end of 1926 the company had on hand $116,000.000 in cash or temporary investments . This year will see nearly $400,000,000 put into plant expenditures , betterments and replacements . It is too early to discuss new financing , but it is quite possible the company may early next year finance its requirements for 1928 and possibly 1929 with a stock issue . providing conditions warrant it . With the stock selling at current levels it would appear that financing would be more attractive through a new stock issue , again producing satisfactory rights to shareholders and mean that the company could take care of its financing by selling direct to stockholders without recourse to banking underwriting . as is usual with the sale of bonds . At present the funded debt of the American Telephone Co. is 8385.190.400 . Structure of the Bell System shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' -e share capital .
