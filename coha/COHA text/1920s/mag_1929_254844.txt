Last week U. S. motorists blinked eyes in astonishment ; U. S. motor car makers held heads proudly high . Astonishment and pride alike resulted from a perusal of automobile production figures for the first quarter of 1929 . For these statistics showed that speeding 1929 was leaving record-breaking 1928 far behind . They demonstrated a percentage increase worthy even of an infant industry ; a volume increase that should materially contribute to the development of the U. S. citizen into a creature with two arms and four wheels . Having produced more than 1,000,000 cars in the first three months of record-breaking 1928 , the automobile industry proceeded to dwarf even this total by a first quarter 1929 production of no less than 1,500,000 cars . Thus production was stepped up from a third of a million to over half a million a month ; thus a 50% increase was gratifyingly recorded ; thus surprising 1928 bowed to amazing 1929 . March production totaled 595,000 cars . <P> Five Million . More cars were made because of Ford 's return to full-volume capacity after the scrapping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach its 1929 quota which , starting at 1,250,000 has been raised to 1,350,000 ; because of furious competition in the under-$1,000 field ; and because of prevailing U. S. prosperity . Production of 1,500,000 cars in the first three months of 1929 of course does not mean that the year will reach a 6,000,000 total , but that it should pass the 5,000,000 mark is a conservative estimate . Previous record ( 1928 ) was 4,635,000 . There are seven or eight million Model T Fords to be replaced , some millions of 4-cylinder Chevrolets that have become antiquated by the Chevrolet shift from a Four to a Six , and four million 1923 models of all makes that have rounded out the six years of service after which the average automobile retains no great expectation of life . It is estimated that 15% of U. S. families have two automobiles and 8% have three . Exported automobiles totaled 13.7% of production in 1928 , should greatly increase in 1929 . Thus the demand for the motorcar remains healthy , and Hoover prosperity is expected to provide the purchase price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obsequies of Model T , last year forced Ford into second position in units produced , Chevrolet taking the lead . With the new models in volume production , however ( 1,359,353 new-model cars and trucks have been produced ) , Ford has regained its lead . In March , Ford built 181,894 cars and trucks , compared to Chevrolet 's 147,274 . <P> General Motors . In addition to its Chevrolet output , General Motors ( which in 1928 produced about 39% of all U. S. cars ) also kept its other companies running at record-breaking figures . Cadillac and La Salle March production totaled 4,009 ; the Olds Motor Works turned out 13,000 Oldsmobiles ( 44% increase over March , 1928 ) ; Buick reached a March figure of 15,206. * Production has also been started on a new General Motors car - the Viking . Made at the Oldsmobile Lansing plant , the Viking is an 8-cylinder car with a V-type motor .
