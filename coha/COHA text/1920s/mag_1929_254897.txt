" I think a fellow who would pay $1,000,000 for a horse ought to have his head examined , and the fellow who turned it down must be absolutely unbalanced . " So last week said John Daniel Hertz , retired Yellow Cabman . He had been offered the million by W. T. Waggoner , Texas oil &; cattleman , for Reigh Count , derby winner ( 1928 ) . He had turned down the offer . Reigh Count is now ready for stud although he may be raced one more season . <P> Second largest offer ever made for a horse-$600,000 by the Aga Khan in 1926 to Sir James Rutherford , Scotch distiller , for Solarie , Ascot cup winner . <P> Last week Reigh Count , Mrs. Hertz 's champion rooster , won the grand prize at the Chicago Poultry Show .
