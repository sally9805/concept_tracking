txt The battle over the effort to make the United States a member of ithe World Court was waged with spirit in the Senate today . The speech of Senator Swanson , ' Democrat , of Virginia , made yesterday , ' to open the campaign for American adhesion to the protocol establishing the tribunal , proved to be preliminary artillery fire to feel out the position of the Administration 's opponents . It had its effect today , when Senator Borah , Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , got into action as the leader of the hoetile forces . Before the day was over the Senate had listened to three addresses devoted mainly to discussing whether the United States would become involved in the political affairs of theLeague ' of Nations if it , joined the permament Court of International Justice at The Hague . Mr. Borah found himself between two fires . At the outset of the debate Senator Lenroot of Wisconsin . Republican , appealed for the adoption of Senator Swanson 's resolution , sanctioned by President Coolidge . Then Mr. Borah tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enabling resolution that measure failed to dissociate the court front ' the Influence , or indeed the dominating control , of the League . Senator Walsh of Montana , Democrat , sought to prove that the adoption of the resolution would leave the United States , as a Member of ' the court , entirely free from League influence or involved in any way in its political affairs . Crowded Galleries Listen . Crowded galleries listened to the forensic contest . Most Senators were in their seats , while in the rear of the chamber were gathered members of the House of Representatives and others entitled to the privilege of the floor , who kept their places for the four hours that the debate continued . The whole scene . was reminiscent of the stirring days when the League of Nations Covenant and the Versailles Treaty were . warmly debated in the same chamber . To those most concerned in the play of party politics the high spot probably was the emphasis laid on the obligation of Republican Senators to adhere ' to the declaration of the Republican national platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court . Senator Lenroot , with obvious Application to Senator Borah , quoted this declaration , and Mr. Borah responded by repeating ? the announcement he had made at the beginning of last year 's campaign that he would not be bound it . The final words of his speech applied to this phase of the question and had a touch of bitterness in them . " Why . Mr. President , " he said , " if a man could be conceived who thought this ' was an injurious proposition or detrimental to his country and would still vote for it because his platform said so , he would be the slimiest creature that ever ' wiggled his way through the United States Senate . " The debate generally : however , was conducted with extreme dignity and show of earnestness . Much interest was shown in ascertaining the line of the opposition campaign as outlined by Mr. Borah . He soon made it apparent That he intended to speak frequently and that his speech today was intended to apply only to a single phase of the issue . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waging what promises to be a losing campaign for him is well . understood , and while he did not disclose the forces he will bring to bear . as the battle Progresses , the impression was conveyed that his plan is similar to that which he followed in his fight against the League of Nations Covenant . In that instance ratification by the Senate appeared to be assured when the Senate debate began , but its prolongation gave the , covenant 's opponents reason for a belief that a large portion of the electorate was impressed by the arguments of ' the opposition and did . not desire the United States to enter the League . Borah Attacks Reservations : Borrowing a leaf from the book of that notable struggle ; ? Mr. Borah sought today to ' show that there could be no dissociation of the Court from the League 's influence and control , and that the United States would find itself subject to the desires.o ; the League if it became affiliated : with . ' the Court . The reservations would net free the - United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this , eontrol , according ' to Mr. Borah , even the one by which the United States declined to be .. beund by advisory opinions of-the Court .. To remedy the defects he alleged , . Mr. Borah submitted reservations of his , O:wn , , the - burden ' of which was that nothing contained:in ; the statute setting , Aip2sthe World'UOUrt ' should be co.nitrued. , t6.:re7 quire the United States to depart-froth its traditional policy " of ** entangling alliances and the ' policy-enunciated to the Monroe Doctrine ; that the Court stab-he ? should not beesznended:witltbut the assent of the Vnited  --  States , and that ho-force **27;555;TOOLONG Should be amproe-ed - to - enforce the Court 's decrees . Senator Lenroot , who-began- the - debate. first denied the , contention that the World- Court was a creature of the League , and then argued- that member ship of the United States - would be a stet , forward in the movement for world peace -- a short step , but nevertheless a step-in the-right direction . " We shOuldadhere to the . Court , " said . Senator Lenroot , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most powerful Nation of the ' world to an instrument for peace . ; Without the World Court the small and weak nations of the .. world must ' submit to the decision of disputes by political representations of ' powerful nations through arbitration or fight There is no forum of justice in which their casesmay be tried . " To illustrate . Germany is disarmed and helpless . from a military standpoint . In disputes-with other nations , she must submit to the decision of the League of Nations , -a political body , to arbitration or to the World Court . a judiciary body whose Judges are elected : without regard to nationality . She must do one or the other of these things or fight She can not make war , and it is therefore no wonder that Germany . although not yet a member of the Court , has participated in- cases before it to a greater extent than any other power . This is because in this forum right is greater than might , and it is. the only international body in existence where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking up the question of propaganda , Senator Lenroot said that there had been much of it by advocates on both sides of the controversy . " Most of the propaganda in opposition , however , " he said , " is very misleading and alleged statements of fact are made which have not the slightest justification . We hear it constantly said by some in opposition to the Court and in newspaper editorials and literature that is sent to Senators that this Court is a creature and agent of the League of Nations and is owned by it . The fact is. as every Senator knows , that this court is American in 1M origin and substantially in its present form was proposed by American statesmen many years ago . " It - was first proposed at the first Hague peace conference , in 1399 , under President 's Administration . At the second peace conference at The Hague , in 1907 , the United States again urged the creation ' of a " Permanent Court of International Justice . " The second ? peace conference failed to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a method of electing the Judges . " Senator Lenroot held that the Court should be judged by what it is and that the fact that the League of Nations recommended it should neither commend nor condemn it . Then he discussed in detail the organic act establishing the Court , seeking thus to show that it was wholly independent of the League . He ended by pointing out that the Republican and Democratic national platforms of 1924 favored membership of the United States in the World Court . - " If there is any such thing , as party government in this country , " he exclaimed , " when a. political party makes a declaration on a great matter Such as this , all doubts should be resolved in favor of it by the members of the party . The Republican Party has spoken on this World Court issue . There were " twenty-two of the Senators on the Republican side of the chamber who occupied seats in the Republican National Convention which adopted the platform . There was nc ? word of dissent from any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made objection during a session of the Platform Committee at the Republican convention , but Senator Lenroot held that as Senator Harreld had note carried his opposition - to the-floor of the convention he had in fact accepted the action taken by the committee . The Borah Reservations . The reservations of Senator Borah , three in number , were offered by him . toward the close of his remarks . Textually. they ' follow : " 1 . The adherence of the United States to the statute of the World Court is conditioned upon the understanding that no-Jurisdiction shall be exercised by or . conferred upon and no duties or service shall be performed by or imposed upon ' or required or requested of the Court other than such as now provided for in the statute of the Court unless the statute is amended in due form and such amendment ratified by every nation signatory to the protocol of adherence to the statute of the Court . " 2 . The adherence of the United States to the statute of the World Court is conditioned upon the understanding that - no force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed to enforce the Judgments , decrees or opinions of the Cout. " 3 . The adherence of the United States to the statute of the World Court is conditioned upon the understanding that nothing contained in the statute shall be so construed as to require the United States of America to depart from its traditional policy of not intruding upon or interfering with or entangling itself in the political questions or policy or internal administration of any foreign State : nor shall anything contained in the said statute be construed to imply ' a ; relinquishment by the United States of America of its traditional attitude toward purely American questions . " Creature of League , Borah Insists . , Mr. Borah explained in beginning his s , peech that his purpose was to confine his remarks " to the sole question of what is the relationship of this tribunal to which we are asked to adhere or to become a member of- to the political body known as the League of Nations . " A generous segment of his speech was devoted to quoting - from a-book on the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and commenting on the quotations to show that the Court was an instrument of the League . He also quoted at some length from Leon Bourgeois , one of those who framed the Court protocol , to support his own contention that the Court was a political body in the sense that the League supplied it - with the law it was to apply . " A great deal has been said , " Mr. Borah went on , " with reference to the fact that the election of the Judges by tise League was made necessary bemuse there was no other way by which to achieve it . I am sure the Senator from ' Wisconsin ( Mr. Lenroot ) would not agree with that , because he has here a resolution providing another method . " And so they contemplate another method , and Mr. Root said after his return home in a public speech that there could have been another method devised , but - the reason they did not do 60 is stated in their report which they Made when they reported the statute to the Council . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judicial organ of the League of Nations , can only be created within the League . As it is to be a component part of the League it must originate from an organization within the League and not from a body outside of it ' " And so they sought no other method by - which to elect the Judges in pursuance of what they understood to be their duty . The Court , being a component part of the League , must necessarily be created from within it , and its Judges must be elected by the League and not by ' somebody outside of the League . " ? - Turning again to statements made by Senator Lenroot , Mr. Borah continued : " The Senator from Wisconsin - referred to the fact that certain propaganda had come to his notice in which it was declared that the Court was.an ' agent of the League and he . found fault with the fact that no one had seen fit to-sponsor this communication . But , my friends , I ' will give to the Senator from Wisconsin the exact language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and who can not be considered unfriendly to this Court . ? Seeks --  to Show . League-ControL " Dr. James Brown Scott accompanied Mr. Root as a counselor and adviser : when he went  --  Berward for the purpose ? of helping to organize the Court . As We all kneir , ? br . Scott has been a life- , long - Salvo- date of ? peace measures , art advocate of:courts and a student and author Of . . internationaltlaws ' ' He says , speaking of ? this in -a written ' communication after his return home : - " ' The Court f in la:ct , the agent of the League , and therefore necessarily intimately connected Ivith- it . ' " Raving been pr when the organization - was dre s- ated ? and when the statute was framed , and knowing the design and purpose : . of - those who had the work to do , and being somewhat competent to juege , he uses the exact language which some one has used in the propaganda which is here criticized  --  that the Court is the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will demonstrate that fact . " Taking up another phase of his effort to show an intimate relationship of the Court to the League , . Mr. Borah said : " I do not - want to content myself ? with the mere statement that that relationship exists . I shall - want to-show , if I can , by the - language of the covenant and of the statute and the action of the Court , that no other view is entertained and I venture to make this assertion , that prior to the time it was proposed that i the United States should go into this court , *ere will not be found anywhere in any of the discussion coming from arNauthoritative source in regard to this Court , an opinion that did not treat it as one of the departments of the League .. " Never until the campaign began to take the United States into the Court was there any language used upon the Part of those in authority indicating that it was anything else than a department of the League . " First , the League ' elects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries of the judges , it ' fixes ? the salaries of all the employes of the court , it fixes the pensions of the judges . But coming more directly to the important feature , the League may- call upon this- court at any time for advice or counsel upon any dispute or any question which-the Council of the League sees fit to submit to it . It makes it the consulting legal adviser of the League , which the League only controls . . Discusses Advisory Opinion ? . " There is not a word in the statute authorizing advisory opinions , or authorizing the court to act - as counsel and adviser of the ' League . If the court should perform - its functions according to the statute to which we are asked to adhere , it would have no power to consult and advise with the League . Will it be said that a tribunal - which may be called upon ny a. political body to advise and counsel is not bound and tied into that political body ? " If we find that the sole authority for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , is in the Covenant of the League , upon - what possible theory can it be contended that this court is not a part of the League and bound to the Covenant by its constitution as the Supreme Court of the United States is bound by the Federal Constitution ? " Bear in mind , now , my friends . that the view here entertained is that the League alone has the power to ask for these advisory opinions ; second , . that it is not within the discretion of the Court to refuse : third , that those opinions may be asked upon any question of dispute , and fourth , that a majority of the Court may render the opinion . " When we take into consideration the numerous political questions and the complex nature of them upon which this Court may be called upon to advise , and upon - which we will be sitting , how is it possible for us to Keep that other pledge of the Republican platform , that is , to stay out of the politics of Europe ? " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute . let us cut out the Possibility of the League of - Nations imposing new obligatioons upon it . The Hughes resolution provides that the statute shalt-not be amended unless they have our consent .. What is the difference about that ? If the League may . impose new , duties , . OA the League may impose new functions , if it - May call upon the Court for additional Work , how are we protected by Saying that - the statute shall not be amended ? If the amendment is offered in good faith ? and I do not doubt that , considering its source  --  then there can be no question ' that the sole amending power should be confined to the amendment of the statute . " Refers to Mosul Decision . Mr. Borah next took up the World Court 's part in the Mosul controversy , saying : " The Court was called upon to render an advisory opinion , not a judicial determination between two parties who had submitted it , but an advisory opinion against a nation which was not a member of the League and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion was rendered the Council proceeded to approve it . Then when Turkey still protested , they proposed by military dower to enforce the judgment against a nonmember nation . " He employed the Mosul instance to show that even if the United States were not a member of the League an ' attempt could be made to enforce a World Court decision against the United States in favor of the League . " What I am saying is , " he added . " if we adhere to a statute which the Court operates and that Court renders an opinion , although it may be an advisory opinion , that opinion is enforced against not only members of the League , but non-members of the League as well . " Not Bound by Party Platform . " The facts to which I have called attention , showing the relationship of the Court to the League , " Mr. Borah went on , " are not changed or modified by the reservations thus far offered . After these reservations are adopted the League will still continue to elect the Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , to fix their pensions , to call upon it for advice and counsel , to enforce its judgments , and to determine the accessibility to the Court . These relationships are not proposed to be changed by the resolutions thus lap offered . " In conclusion the Senator said : ? " Just a word , Mr. President , with reference to the closing remarks of the Senator from Wisconsin ( Mr. Lenroot ) as to political parties and the obligation which we owe in this particular situation by reason of the fact that a plank in the Platform indicates that the party was in favor of the Court . " If I rang be permitted to say so , personally that does not reach me at all . I took occasion , as soon as the platform was published , to announce publicly that I- should not be bound by that pltform in that particular and some others ; and during the campaign that position - was made known . When some of the friends in the East of some of the associations who were is favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I replied that I would not be bound by the platform ; and that letter was Published . So ; as far as I am individually concerned I do not feel any embarrassment in the situation . " No Obligations , Asserts Walsh . ? At the outset of his address Senator Walsh said : " The consequence and the consequences of the step we are . invited to take by , the resolution before us has been magnified out of all reason by the friends and foes alike of the World Court , or rather by the overardent friends and the implacable enemies of the League of . Nations . " Upon a dispassionate consideration of the proposal submitted to the Senate by the late President Harding in the month of February , 1923. now nearly three years ago , the acceptance and approval of which are contemplated in the . resolution under debate , it will appear that we bind ourselves to nothing , abe solutely nothing . by . the ratification Of the treaty aa be proposed , save that we agree to contribute toward the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We enter . into no covenant to do or refrain from doing anything . , We ? would continue to enjoy , should the treaty , or protocol as it is called , be ratified , everyeright as a sovereign ; nation we now enjoy . We do not undertake to submit to the Court any controversy in which we may become involved . We assume no responsibility . for any -. e . . - decagon **27;584;TOOLONG - or - for the enforcement et anyfjudgmenttit Masi ' render. : : ' As We ; incur no obligations -- bY-adhering to the protocol , we acquire no rights . ' ? . " We may , if we-see fit to ' do so now , resort to the Court for a determination of our - rights in. any eontroversy- we may have with another nation . Our right in-that regard- is neither expanded nor restricted by ratification of the protocol . I repeat- that we obligate. ourselves to nothing bY the treaty or'pro.tocol. - - ?  - -  -  " It - may be a - matter , of surprise to some , from much that has been said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise to many to learn that neither the present . Chief Executive ot the nation . nor ? his amiable and ' complaisant predecessor has , through their advocacy . of adherence to the protocol , sought . to commit - us to any of the obligations of the Covenant or to lead - us into are Outskirts of the League . It is to the following brief article and to ' that alone , that it is proposed we become a party . " He then quoted Article 36 of ige Court ' statute stating that " the jurisdiction of the Court  --  comprises all cases ' which the parties reeer to it and all matters specially provided for in treaties ' and conventions in force . " Mr. Walsh then *went on : ? " The Court , accordingly , has no jurisdiction to proceed in any ease unless the parties have theretofore agreed that it may determine the same . The . Court , contrary ' to reckless statements widely published , has no power , it is invested with no authority , should the United States adhere to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal . It must come of its own volition or the Court is impotent as to it . Sees Monroe Doctrine Not Affected . " In this situation lies the complete- ansever to - the suggestion that , should we adhere to the protocol , the Monroe Doctrine will come before the Court or may come before the Court for adjudication . It will only if the United States consents to submit , not otherwise . ' ? ? " What responsibility do we assume with reference to judgments rendered by ahe Court ? What , pledge do we make with reference to any judgment that may be rendered against the United States , assuming . we do agree in the future to submit and do actually submit a specific controversy to the Court for adjudication ? Into what undertaking do we enter looking to the enforcement of judgments of the Court in controversies between other nations or in causes to which our country may be a party ? None ; absolutely none in any ease and for the very good reason that the statute makes no provision whatever for the enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests on its - own. bottom , - has its foundation , , not in the Treaty of Versailles or in the covenant of the League of Nations , but is built upon a separate treaty we are asked to approve , promulgated Dec. 16 , 1920 . By that treaty we caesurae no obligations whatever , either under the Versailles Treaty or the covenant of the , League of Nations or otherwise . OurDtatus toward the League is in no affected by the adherence contemplated by the pending resolution . That our support will usher in an era of perpetual peace is a delusion , the fact being that by adhering to the protocol we take , but a feeble , halting step in ' the direction of promoting world peace , as said by a Frenchman , a polite gesture . Staggering as it may seem , there are those who maintain we should not even make a gesture toward cooperation to that end . " Walsh Also Refers to Mosul . . . An ironic reference was made by , Senator Walsh to- the suggestion attributed to Senator Borah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a new World Court divorced from the League . " A sudden adintritiora - has been , developed among opponents of *adherence for a third Hague conference to establish a World Court , " he said : " But it was tried once-and failed ; and tailecanecause nte one had thought , apparently , of a plan in principle like that developed-.by the Jurists ' Committee ; for the- selection of the Judges . Assuming the nations now supporting the Court Were - willing to scrap it and join in ' setting up another , would the Judges be free from temptations of the character indicated to - which the members of the Court now - functioning are subject ? If wa ' indulge - such ungenerous ' and unjust . suspicions about the Judges* of any possible World Court , of course we should hold ' aloof from any and - let the world- go hang . " - Mr. Walsh also discussed the allegation that the case of Mosul had proved that the World Court was a political institution . Reviewing the Iraq-Mosul controversy at some length , Mr. Walsh ended by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the affair that among other gross misrepresentations concerning the court , appearing while the questions referred to were under consideration in editorials in ' a newspaper read by most members of the Senate , the statement was made that the court in question is not a court , but- an agency for the resolution of political questions , in support of which general asseveration it was asserted that the court was then wrestling with the purely political problem of whether Mosul should go to Great Britain or to Turkey . r " The court has never been asked to deal with any but judicial . questions ; it , has never attempted to do so , and it has no authority to entertain any other . That it is so restricted is beyond serious question. , A tribunal- might be called a I court and ' yet be invested with authority other than judicial , but unless expressly so clothed it follows from its name'that ' it has judicial powers only . " ?                @ @ @ @ @
