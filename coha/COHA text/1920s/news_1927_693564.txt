txt M. PO1NCARE 'S offer of a voluntary payment on the American debt equivalent to the first year 's annuity under the Mellon-Berenger agreement reveals the French Premier in a new light . It has been the custom to speak of POINCARE 'S mind and method as drily legalistic . His enemies have described him as a malicious lawyer . His friends credit him with much higher motives , without denying the precision in him . A policy of such vast moment as the invasion of the Ruhr was justified by M. PO1NCARE on the ground of technical violations by Germany of her reparation pledges in the matter of coal and wood deliveries . With the British on the Reparation Commission he fought a great battle on the question whether German default must be proclaimed by a unanimous decision of the commission or only by a majority . It is a different PO1NCARE who now offers to throw in an extra $10,000 , - 000 on the regular annual payment due us as interest on the $407,000,000 worth of war supplies which France took over in 1920 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome precedent . He comes close to ratifying the Mellon-Berenger agreement morally . He is taking it upon himself to disburse public funds without the sanction of Parliament . But POIXCARE has not lost his cunning in the law . He replies that the payment of obligations automatically falling due is an administrative and not a parliamentary function . He has the money for the first payment earmarked among the German reparation payments . But his real argument is emphatically non-legalistic . He holds that $10,000,000 is a small fee to pay for a year 's respite from the debt problem . In a year much may happen on both sides of the Atlantic . One specific consideration which has so far not emerged in the discussion , but which is probably in M. POINCARE 'S mind , is the war-supplies debt . Obligations for a principal sum of more than $400,000,000 have been in the hands of the United States Treasury for half a dozen years . The principal falls due in August , 1929 . That Is some distance away , but the French war-debt problem has been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement the supplies debt is assimilated to the rest of the funded debt , on which France would pay In 1929 the sum of $32 , - 500,000 . Without that agreement she will be confronted in 1929 with the task of redeeming a principal sum close to half a billion dollars . It is not difficult to see where the advantage to France lies in a provisional nonparliamentary operation of the MellonBerenger settlement .
