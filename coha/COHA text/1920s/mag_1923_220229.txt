Dr. Marie Carmichael Stopes , authoress of Married Love and Wise Parenthood , lost her libel suit against Dr. H. G. Sutherland , who accused her of " experimenting on poor women . " The Lord Chief Justice set aside the verdict of the jury awarding her 100 damages , stating that no evidence had been presented showing that the accusations made by Dr. Sutherland were founded upon ill will . He summed up Dr. Stopes ' birth control activities as " a monstrous campaign . " The learned Judge 's opinion is not likely to be popular in London , where Dr. Stopes is believed to have done considerable good in a spirit of broad-minded decency.
