His father was a Segura , his mother a Saenz , so they called him ( by old Spanish custom ) Pedro Segura y Saenz . Little did his parents guess , as they stood beside the font at his baptism some 49 years ago , that their swarthy infant would one day be a great one of the Church . The diocese of Burgos , Spain , saw his birth . Burgos saw him consecrated as its Archbishop . But only a secret consistory of his peers in the Vatican last week saw Pope Pius XI confer on Burgos ' Archbishop the red hat of the cardinalate , making him the titular priest of Rome 's Santa Maria in Trastevere . <P> Created and proclaimed a Cardinal in December 1927 , two years had Cardinal Saenz been hatless . According to Spanish tradition , His Most Catholic Majesty King Alfonso XIII should have conferred the hat , in loco Papae . Instead , Cardinal Saenz had it from the hands of the Holy Father himself . <P> The College of Cardinals now stands : Italian , 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there are 12 vacancies . <P> Not since the present Pope entered the Vatican has the College of Cardinals had its full quota . To fill the vacancies would be : 1 ) expensive , since Cardinal allowances ( except for U. S. Cardinals ) are paid by the Pope ; 2 ) embarrassing , for there are many more candidates than places ; 3 ) perhaps impolitic , for already the non-Italian Cardinals outnumber the <P> Italian . Under former Popes , consistories were held twice yearly . But Pius XI is independent of such tradition . Said Vatican rumor : the next consistory will be called on the 50th anniversary of His Holiness ' priesthood , next month .
