At the request of Premier Jan Christian Smuts , the Governor General of South Africa ( the Earl of Athlone , brother of Queen Mary ) dissolved the Parliament of the U. S. A. ( Union of South Africa ) . <P> The dissolution came as a complete surprise to the public and was caused by a Government loss of the seat at Wakkerstroom , which convinced the Premier that his Cabinet might no longer have the confidence of the country . <P> General elections having been slated for June , Premier Smuts advised the Governor General to request postponement of the projected visit of the Prince of Wales during the coming Summer . <P> The outcome of the elections is considered by experts to be dubious , if not foreboding . The situation was succinctly summed up by Sir Edgar Walton , High Commissioner for South Africa in London : " It is very possible that a Nationalist majority will be returned in the coming elections , and Nationalism in South Africa stands for Republicanism , although the Nationalists are not understood to be pressing their Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smuts , South Africa Party , and General B. M. Hertzog , Nationalist Party , and promises to be as close as it will be exciting .
