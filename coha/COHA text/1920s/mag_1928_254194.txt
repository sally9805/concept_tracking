Terry 's Children <P> Sirs : <P> Thanks for the pleasure of TIME which is the only magazine I subscribe to but-please be more careful of statements if you must make them in place of queries . In this week 's July 30 notice of Miss Terry are two errors . I. You will find that the father of her children was not Charles Wardell if you care to enquire . II . She did not ' " detest " American audiences but adored them and they her . Henry Irving was more appreciated here even than in England therefore there is no base for such an assertion . Both Miss Terry and Irving deplored the fact that England did not appreciate Booth and when he failed there most pathetically , Irving made Booth act in his theatre and share his honors as the great artist and gentleman he was . This as a beau jeste to Americans whom he was most grateful to and has never tired of acknowledging that same great debt . No ! No ! No ! Ellen Terry did not " detest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> ARTHUR WILLIAM Row Manhattan <P> It is stated by Forrest Izzard in Heroines of the Modern Stage that the father of Gordon Craig and Ailsa Craig , borne by Actress Ellen Terry , was Charles Wardell . Others have made this statement ; many persons credit it . Let Arthur William Row name the father of Ellen Terry 's children , if he can . If it is difficult to name the father of a lady 's children , it is equally difficult to estimate posthumously her detestations . It is certain that Ellen Terry , toward the end of her life , sent messages of felicitation to U. S. admirers . Those , however , who knew her well acknowledge that she cherished a perhaps well-merited resentment against U. S. theatre-goers . This resentment has been recorded in journals or elsewhere. - ED . <P> <P> Egypt for Revenue <P> Sirs : In your otherwise accurate article on Egypt ( TIME , July 30 , p. 13 ) occurs the following : " If Great Britain abandoned them to true independence , they would again fall prey to some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . For this reason the British Foreign Office has honestly and without hypocrisy proclaimed that control of Egypt is , for the British Empire , a measure of self defense . " Five years ' residence in Cairo , and conversations with British officials in many Departments prove to me that you credit them with a candor which they are far from claiming themselves . The Suez Canal is a mere pretext , and is so admitted by British officials . Nothing would be easier than to fortify a zone on either side of the canal , instead of garrisoning the whole Nile Valley for two thousand miles . No other Power could possibly interfere . With its Mediterranean Base at Malta , the British Navy always has , and always will , control the sea , and would have no difficulty in maintaining a Monroe Doctrine for Egypt . On both sides Egypt is flanked by a limitless desert which no army could cross . . . . The British rule Egypt well ; make no mistake about that . But it is for Empire revenue , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military absurdity of the plea that it is necessary to occupy Khartoum in order to keep Mussolini out of Alexandria . <P> WILLIAM A.
