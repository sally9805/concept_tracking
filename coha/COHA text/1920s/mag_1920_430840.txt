 | WE LIVE in an age which questions everything . The past generation was one of religious criticism . This is one of commercial criticism , " said Calvin Coolidge , an American whose principles of citizenship , which the people endorsed by re-electing him Governor of Massachusetts , have cut away the radical underbrush . It is stimulating to question everything , but a man who can restore such disorder of opinions , must do so by the wisdom of his personal life . An army of men , through the medium of their newspapers , have spent the energy and force of their craft interpreting Coolidge a miracle-roan ? not of politics but of statesmanship . The personal qualities of Coolidge have been difficult to adapt to the human-interest story , because he has himself balked at the usual processes . To know a man well is often to see him with mediocre vision , perspective is required to see him in the full power and purpose of his being . For many years Coolidge practised law in the tight , puritanical little New England city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a small frame house there . Since he has been elected Governor he has rented two rooms in a hotel in Boston as his official residence . There are those who would call this modest way of living indication that he is mediocre , and there are hundreds of thousands in the country , who , living just like him , know that these are the habitual methods of intelligent  | citizens . They combine the best principles of good citizenship , thrift , industry , democracy of temperament . The growth of citizenship is one of the deepest elements of the Coolidge miracle . One gathers from all he said , that any good citizen reasonably keyed to the broad issues of the period to which he belongs is a distinguished figure , for so he may grow in moral force , from things untold , from the inner sources that are the mould and substance of the man himself . Coolidge has demonstrated that celebrity in national life is not a matter of personality , of stature or impressive voice . It is a normal quality as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of walking downstairs . It is lacking only in men who are abnormal . How Calvin Coolidge has retained this balance of principle was shown in an abnormal period , during the police strike in Boston . How he restored the principles of citizenship in the midst of the disorder of that strike is the result of a lifetime of legislative conscience . This is the story of his evolution , a mental picture of Coolidge. - There is , in the thoughts and utterances of the man , an analysis of ideas that go into the making of a hundred per cent American citizen , ideas that function from the sources of patriotic allegiance ( from which the reader may trace the manner of thinking and living of Governor Coolidge ) , which is the inheritance of all Americans who have grown into vigorous comprehension of American citizenship . " Men do not make laws , " said Coolidge . " They do but discover them . Laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority . They must rest on the eternal foundation of righteousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in executive experience when he said this , while acknowledging the honor of becoming President of the Senate of his State . Out of the threatening atmosphere of the great war which was then menacing Europe , he must have felt something of its aftermath . This was one of his earliest statements that revealed his personal conception of citizenship . It is interesting to follow his mental proc- esses from this point . Much that he said on that occasion may serve to translate certain close-fitting principles of his own , that seem like new matter , though they were only constitutional thoughts opposing those dangerous standards that have menaced the world since the War 's upheavals . Addressing the State Senate then , he said : PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND ORDER " THE WELFARE of the weakest and the welfare of the most powerful are inseparably bound together . Industry can not flourish if labor languishes . Transportation can not prosper if manufactures decline . The general welfare can not be provided for in any one act , but it is well to remember that the benefit of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is the neglect of all . The suspension of one man 's dividends is the suspension of another man 's pay envelope . Courts are established , not to determine popularity of a clause , but to adjudicate and enforce rights . No litigant should be required to submit his case to the hazard of expense of a political campaign . No judge should be required to seek or receive political rewards . The electorate and judiciary can not be combined . A hearing means a hearing . When the trial of causes goes outside the court room , Anglo-Saxon constitutional government ends . " In weighing the fundamental principles of law and order , he further reveals the stamina of a man who has always been indifferent to political exactions . " The people can not look to legislation generally for success , " he said . " Industry , thrift , character , are not conferred by act or result . Government can not relieve from toil . It can provide no substitute for the rewards of service . It can , of course , care for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves . Self-government means self-support . " Democracy of feeling is the chief element of the Coolidge brand of citizenship . He seems to have lived without envy or malice , with a clear perception of class distinctions that he saw would threaten the staunch democratic principles of American citizenship .  | In this relation he said : " History reveals no civilized people among whom there were not a highly educated class , and large aggregations of wealth , represented usually by the clergy and the nobility . Inspiration has always come from above . Diffusion of learning has come down from the university to the common school ? the kindergarten is last . No one would now expect to aid the common school by abolishing higher education . LARGE PROFITS MEAN LARGE PAY ROLLS " IT MAY be that the diffusion of wealth works in an analogous way . As the little red schoolhouse is builded in the college , it may be that the fostering and protection of large aggregations of wealth are the only foundation on which to build the prosperity of the whole people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the result of service performed . In no land are there so many and such large aggregations of wealth as here ; in no land do they perform larger service ; in no land will the work of a day bring so large a reward in material and spiritual welfare . " Up to this time , when these thoughts were so well expressed , so finely crystallized , Coolidge had been studying , silently assembling the functions of citizenship that seemed to be inherent to him . Up to this time , he had been one among many men in legislative employment whose political prospects attracted no attention . There is no place in his record , that one can find , when he seemed to seek a political horoscope of his future . " Do the day 's work , " has been his prevailing slogan , which is the orderly process of normal citizenship . He measures issues , that might have political chances in them , with a plumb line that all can see . Nor does he exert the spellbinder 's trick of forcing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of applying arithmetic to public morals . He knew what to expect in politics and how to avoid those expectations . " Expect to be called a demagogue , but do n't be a  | demagogue , " he said . " Do n't hesitate to be as revolutionary as science . Do n't hesitate to be as reactionary as the multiplication table . Do n't expect to build the weak by pulling down the strong . If it be to help a powerful corporation better to serve the people , whatever the opposition , do that . Expect to be called the stand-patter , but do n't be a standpatter . " Before the executive chances came to him , he had reached definite conclusions relating to their responsibilities . " Give administration a chance to catch up with legislation , " he said , " statutes must appeal to more than material welfare , wages wo n't satisfy , be they ever so large . Man has a spiritual nature . Touch it , and it must respond as the magnet responds to the pole . " He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance of words . One feels no personal attraction to this rare man , but one leaves him with a clear vision , with better reasoning powers to meet one 's experiences . He is of New England stock , with the pioneering instinct inherited from that ancestry . A silent man , negligent of vanity even in his best mood of oratory . For a man so young ? he is only forty-seven ? he is advanced in the wisdom of principles that much older men never discover . Of the early development of American principles he said : DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN PRINCIPLES HISTORY is the revelation . It is the manifestation in human affairs of a power not ourselves that makes for righteousness . ' Savages have no history . It is the mark of civilization . ' New England , for instance , slumbered from the dawn of creation until the beginning of the 17th century , not unpeopled , but with no record of human events worthy of a name . Different races came , and lived and vanished , but the story of their existence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalist tells of the animal kingdom , or the geologist relates of the formation of the crust of the earth . It takes men of larger vision and a higher inspiration , with a power to impart a larger vision  | and a higher inspiration to the people , to make history . It is not a negative , but a positive achievement . It is unconcerned with building of despotism or treason or rebellion or betrayal , but bows in reverence before Moses or Hampden or Washington or Lincoln , or the Light that shone on Calvary . The principles set out in the Declaration of Independence are older than the Christian religion , or Greek philosophy . Democracy is not a tearing down ; it is a building up . It is not a denial of the divine right of kings ; it supplements that claim with the assertion of the divine right of all men . It does not destroy ; it fulfills . It is the consummation of all theories of government , to the spirit of which all the nations of the earth must yield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is and can be no more doubt of the triumph of democracy in human affairs , than there is of the triumph of gravitation in the physical world ; the only question is how and when . Its foundation lays hold upon eternity . " These are the solid interpretations of our national ideals upon which Calvin Coolidge has rooted his distinguished claim to American citizenship . In them there is the sweep and impulse that are the impressive characteristics of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence . Steeped in the pure statesmanship of that document , Coolidge approaches politics with equal reverence , with the same precepts and principles that he gathers along the historical fareway of American history . Political intelligence may become , in this man 's fine perceptions of executive responsibility , a desirable ideal , for what he says of politics seems like something that has never been said before . WHAT POLITICS MEANS " POLITICS is not an end , but a means , " he said . " It is not a product , but a process . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterfeits . So much emphasis has been put upon the false , that the significance of the true has been obscured , and politics has come to convey the meaning of crafty and cunning selfishness , instead of candid and sincere service . The Greek  | derivation shows the nobler purpose . Politics means cityrearing , state-craft . And when we remember that city also meant civilization , the spurious presentment , mean and sordid , drops away and the real figure of the politician , dignified and honorable , a minister to civilization , author and finisher of government , is revealed in its true and dignified proportions . Why some succeed in public life and others fail would be as difficult to tell as why some succeed or fail in other activities . " Very few men in America have started out with any fixed idea of entering public life , fewer still would admit having such an idea . For centuries some seats in the British Parliament were controlled and probably sold , as were commissions in the army , but that has never been the case here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington was asked by an old friend how he happened to be elected . He replied that he was not elected , but appointed . It is worth while noting that the boss who was then supposed to hold the power of appointment in that district has been driven from power , but the Congressman has been re-elected . All of which suggests that the boss did not appoint in the first instance , but was merely well enough informed to see what the people wanted before they had formulated their own opinions and desires . It was said of McKinley that he could tell what Congress would do on a certain measure before the men in Congress themselves knew what their decision was to be . Joe ' Cannon has said of McKinley that his ear was so close to the ground that it was full of grasshoppers . Every native-born American , however , is potentially a President , and it must always be remembered that the obligation to serve the state is forever binding upon all , although office is the gift of the people . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather marked for its number of rich men . Few prominent members of Congress are dependent on their salary , which is but another way of saying that in Washington , Senators and Representatives need more than their official salaries to become most effective .  | WRONG IDEAS OF PUBLIC LIFE BUT THE inexperienced are prone to hold an erroneous idea of public life and its methods . There are dishonest men in public office , but our public men as a class , are inspired by honorable and patriotic motives . Public men must expect criticisms and be prepared to endure false charges from their opponents . It is a matter of no great concern to them . But public confidence in government is a matter of great concern . It is necessary to differentiate between partisan assertions and actual conditions . It is necessary to recognize worth as well as to condemn graft . No system of government can stand that lacks public confidence , and no progress can be made on the assumption of false premise . " I do not feel that there is any more obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker , a merchant , a teacher , or enter any other special occupation . There is no catalogue of capacity in politics . One man gets results in one way , another in another . But in general only the man of broad sympathy and deep understanding of his fellow men can meet with much success . What I have said relates to the somewhat narrow field of office-holding . " We gather from these opinions uttered by Calvin Coolidge , that he is not a politician of the old school , for he is eternally bound by the progress of principles versus politics . Whether he idealizes or not , is beside the issue . His recent re-election infers that he is intensely practical . Before closing the door on this interesting subject , in its immediate relations to the career of Governor Coolidge , the following statement from him becomes important : " The State is not founded on selfishness , " he said . " It can not maintain itself by the offer of material rewards . It is the opportunity for service . " The victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is a victory of ideals that make good citizens , it is a victory of principles . Being an effort to present a mental picture of Coolidge , this story suggests an impression that it would be well to weigh men that way . Instead of examining his photograph , let us examine his ideas , and learn the calibre of mind that has placed him in the arena of national life . Coolidge-ideas are worth teaching , because they are principles of citizenship .
