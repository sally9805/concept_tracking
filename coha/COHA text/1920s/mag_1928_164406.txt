( See front cover ) <P> Out of the jabberwocky that is politics in the State of Illinois there issued last week a frabjous thing that was supposed to spell R-e-f-o-r-m but which , upon closest inspection , would not come any closer to real sense than Roefmr or Mrrofe . The letters were all there . Popular sentiment had been convulsively aroused . But the newly upheaved anagram did not articulate intelligently . <P> The occasion for the upheaval was the Illinois primary election . Among the Democrats , nothing extraordinary happened . Their party was out of power and they quietly went to the polls to nominate candidates whom they scarcely hoped to elect next autumn unless Candidate Smith , for whom they meant the State 's 58 uninstructed national delegates , can carry all before him . <P> Among the Republicans , it was a spectacular primary even for spectacular Illinois . It was the Republicans who tried to spell Reform . About 100,000 Democrats got excited and joined in the G. O. P. melee , confusing things more than ever . The Republican primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lennington Small , the Governor , was overwhelmingly defeated for renomination by Louis L. Emmerson , who had been Secretary of State , since 1916 . Mr. Small 's reputation had been thoroughly discredited . Trying to save himself he entered alliance with his oldtime enemy , Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill " ) Thompson of Chicago . Mr. Emmerson ran as a champion of virtue-yet Mr. Emmerson was for years a Small henchman and it was he who passed the checks to some Missouri delegates in 1920 , causing the scandal that deprived Frank Orren Lowden of that year 's presidential nomination . <P> Senator . Frank Leslie Smith , the U. S. Senator-elect whom the U. S. Senate declared unseatable last winter , was thrust still farther aside by Otis F. Glenn , a young downstate lawyer . But Mr. Glenn 's backer , hero of the great R-e-f-o-r-m movement , was thick-lensed U. S. Senator Charles Samuel Deneen , who , only a few months ago , was in league to get Smith seated . This shift was but one of the inconsistencies in Champion Deneen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name has been a synonym for social war and political billingsgate , Champion Deneen warred upon Robert E. Crowe , the State 's attorney of Leopold-Loeb fame and Mayor Thompson 's entourage . Deneen and his candidate , Judge John A. Swanson , survived bombs exploded on their doorsteps and routed Crowe utterly . Mayor Thompson had vowed to resign if this happened but , of course , did not resign . The **26;12773;TOOLONG slogan , " America First , " was as thoroughly exposed as the Ku Klux Klan . Libel suits and coroner 's inquests were on Thompsonism 's hands after the polls closed . But still the Thompson machine retained enough city patronage to make " America First " worth while until it is actually run out of town . Perhaps that will not happen before 1931 , the next mayoral election . Meantime , more credit for Crowe 's defeat was due to Judge Swanson himself , and to Chicago 's loud-shouting newspapers , than to Champion Deneen . <P> Congressmen . The Congressional nominations of the G. O. P. in Illinois had four points of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
