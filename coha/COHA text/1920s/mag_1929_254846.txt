Last week many a Cheney journeyed to South Manchester , Conn. , met many another Cheney . These multitudinous Cheneys were gathered for the wedding of Frances , daughter of Frank Cheney Jr . to Roger , son of Architect Charles A. Platt . After the wedding the Cheneys drove around the town , inspecting their bailiwick . On their tour of inspection , reflective , antiquarian Cheneys may have mused on the year 1833 , when the first Cheney came into contact with the first silkworm cocoon at South Manchester . Since then the town has known many Cheneys , many cocoons . Genealogically-minded Cheneys may have pondered , as they drove about , on the ramifications of relationship between the various families descended from the original seven Cheney brothers : Ralph , Ward , Frank , Rush , Charles , John , Seth . <P> No matter what their turn of mind , all Cheneys saw a Cheney-built schoolhouse and a Cheney-built library . They saw a large wooded park , around which were dotted nine large Cheney residences and a half dozen smaller Cheney houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warehouses . They saw block on block of Cheney-built employes ' houses . But they saw no Cheney-built churches , for the Cheneys , though exceedingly moral , are no pillars of the church . <P> Of silk was the bride 's dress , and of silk were the speculations of many a Cheney. * Handsome , solemn , gray-haired Charles Cheney , President of Cheney Bros. , thought with satisfaction of a letter he had received that week : " The committee recommends that the Craftsmanship Medal be awarded to the Cheney Brothers for the beauty of design and texture in their modern machine woven silks . " At the top of the letter was a handsome design : a Doric capital and shaft supported by an American eagle with outspread wings . Beneath this was engraved , " The American Institute of Architects . " <P> But most seriously to be considered by Cheneys were two problems : 1 ) overproduction ; 2 ) tariff . Spokesman in both matters is Vice President Horace B. Cheney , who spoke twice last week . <P> Like the oilmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year a monthly average of 94.5% of all broad looms were in operation . Huge surpluses of finished silk are stacking up in warehouses . Buyers are holding back , waiting for a price break . Like the oilmen , the silkmen need Government acquiescence in an agreement . But the government , much though it might like to , is too tangled up with anti-trust legislation to help or acquiesce in either oil or silk plans ( see National Affairs ) . <P> As to tariff , there would appear to be no limit to the willingness or power of the Government to give Cheneys and others the rates they need . But in this respect , silkmen can not agree among themselves . Not alone did Vice President Horace Cheney represent the Silk Association of America before the House Ways &; Means Committee at Washington . A. P. Stapfer was also there . Mr. Cheney suggested rates double those of 1909 . But Mr. Stapfer suggested reduced rates on georgettes , crepe de chines , flat crepes . Reason : the Cheney group is exclusively manufacturing ; the Stapfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group is exclusively , importing .
