Persons of fashion use a strange adjective for the things which they consider as belonging properly to their environment ; such things they call " smart . " Less polished people use an adjective which is far more descriptive of smart things : they use the word " ritzy . " The word is from the proper noun , Ritz ; Ritz is the name of the smartest chain of hotels in the world . <P> There are not very many of them-nineteen-and they are generally full. * Moreover , Ritz hotels are only built in fashionable cities , in cities where there are likely to be many visitors who are capable of appreciating the finer social distinctions . <P> <P> Boston , for example , now has a Ritz . Berlin has no Ritz , never has had a Ritz , and , probably , never will have a Ritz . For Berlin , the Adlon , a handsome and comfortable hotel , is sufficiently regal . <P> The U. S. , a less civilized unit than the continent of Europe , has isolated districts in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such ; it has a Ritz . Boston and Philadelphia-these two have been given a Ritz . Atlantic City is flashy , yet is permitted a Ritz . Last week it became known that one other city in the U. S. would achieve this monumental seal on its civic success . There was some doubt , however , which city this would be , that would outclass Berlin and cast shame on Tokyo . It might be Chicago . It might more probably be Los Angeles . <P> Other chambers of commerce might indeed come clamoring for a Ritz in their town . Knowing the principles of the founder of the Ritz Hotels , well-informed observers were sure such demands would be snubbed promptly and with proper severity . <P> The founder of the Ritz Hotels did not choose that curious monosyllable by chance ; Ritz was his last name ; his first , splendidly enough , was Csar . The son of a Swiss farmer , his first skirmish among European hostelries occurred when he opened a restaurant in Baden-Baden , the Kurhaus . He boasted that he never forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his restaurant requires a more complete explanation . Csar Ritz read faces as well as remembering them ; he was an instinctive &; selective snob , one of those likeable snobs whose hauteur is inherent ; he did not consciously single out his richer patrons for special attention . Nonetheless it was the epicures who remembered him , and the princes and the millionaires . Other people were a little frightened by M. Ritz , even intimidated by his martial cognomen or his last name that sounded sharp and hard . <P> When a man has owned a smart restaurant for a few years he has enough friends to run a hotel . Csar Ritz bought the Minerva , in Baden Baden , and carried on the tradition of his Kurhaus . Later he bought more hotels and titled people stayed in them . Csar knew them all by name . When he opened the Carlton in London , he gave an elaborate banquet . The guests were all titled , with the exception of a few very rich Americans ; one of these was a banker to whom M. Ritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel before its formal opening because the banker had been recommended to him by an old friend in the U. S.
