A " gimmick " is a person who puts a price tag on everything he sees and a label on everything he thinks . Most musicians pride themselves on not being gimmicks . To differentiate themselves from this clan , they wear their hair longer ; their neckties , their phrases , are more picturesque . The only criticism they fear is the accusation that they fear criticism , that they are trying to make themselves as gimmicks are . Not so Vincent Lopez , famed jazzbo .

If you have heard an orchestra , and get the orchestra you heard , then it may be O. K. But if you can not get the one you want , the one you get may be O. K. and it may not . What we are going to do is to train orchestras so that , if you order one from us anywhere in the U. S. , you will always get the same thing and know what you are getting . . . .
