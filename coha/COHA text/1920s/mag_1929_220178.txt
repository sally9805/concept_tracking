Filtering through the mails last week , from London to U. S. advertising managers , came a letter which ran as follows : " Dear Sir : <P> ' Britannia ' is NOT the most marvellous paper that has ever been produced . It is NOT controlled by supermen and superwomen . The whole world does NOT eagerly await the appearance of ' Britannia ' every Friday morning . <P> ' ' But . . . ' Britannia ' is out to make friends-not enemies . Will you not let us number you among our friends and give ' Britannia ' a trial in your next appropriation ? " <P> To this request even the most friendly could not respond , for while the letter was on its way , the choleric , anti-U.S . weekly Britannia ( TIME , Nov. 5 ) had failed under the extravagant editorship of Novelist Gilbert ( " Swankau " ) Frankau and was about to lose its identity in a merger with England 's popular Eve , according to statements issued by wealthy , wiry William Harrison , owner of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York 's Hotel Ambassador , last fortnight , nervous and be-spatted Publisher Harrison refused to discuss onetime Editor Frankau . He also refused to discuss the purpose of his visit to the U.S. , beyond the usual foreigner 's phrase : " I am studying America . " But , in alternately low-voiced and explosive sentences , he was ready to speak of his fondness for golf ; his many publications ( including Tatler , Sketch , and Daily Chronicle ) ; his 25 paper mills in England , Scotland , Germany ; and his 1,500,000 acres of esparto grass in northern Africa . <P> Esparto is a wild grass , growing tall as the bulrush . It flourishes in the sandy parts of northern Africa . It is picked for Papermaker-Publisher Harrison by a small army of Arabs . It is expensive , for the boiling down of the pulp diminishes its bulk by 50% . With the vigor of a true Yorkshireman , Mr. Harrison last week took pains to denounce as an ass an imaginative U. S. reporter who wrote how esparto grass had to be plucked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
