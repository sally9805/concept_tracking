Mme Ekaterina Kalinin , wife of Michael Ivanovitch Kalinin , peasant President of the Soviet Republic , is coming to the United States on a visit . It is understood that the United States Government has ac- corded her the necessary permission and has cabled the Consuls at Riga and Reval to vise her passports . Mme. Kalinin insists that no political capital will be made out of her visit . She is coming in response to the invitation of the American Committee for Relief of Russian Children to make a two months ' tour of the United States , as representative of the Central Committee of the Rus-sian Red Cross Society . Her purpose is to appeal for aid for the famine stricken orphans of Russia . " Firstly and chiefly , " said she , " I want to thank the people of America . . . . We have millions of orphans who need clothes , medicines , education , books - everything - as well as foodstuffs , and Russia is so poor . Then I want to see your new- est schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . " Mme. Kalinin is expected to sail shortly . She , like her husband , is a simple peasant . A woman of about 35 years of age , she is the mother of three children and the foster mother of two famine orphans .
