txt WATERWAYS AND FREIGHT . Mr. Hoover 's West Branch Remarks Contain Puzzling Statements . To the Editor of The New York Tittles : Mr. Hoover , in his homecoming speech at West Branch on Aug. 21 , spoke at considerable length- on the development of interior waterways as promising relief to farmers , and in concluding his remarks on this topic said : " And this means more than the actual saving upon the goods shipped over these routes . If part of our crops can move to market at a seven to ten cent saving , per bushel , the buyers ' competitive bidding for this portion of the crop will force upward the price of the whole crop . " This is an extraordinary statement . If he had said ? that the reduced freight rates would raise the price received by the farmer whose crop could bermoved . to market by the new route , all ' would have agreed with him . But he says that:the reducing of the rate on a part of the crop would increase the price of the - whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tend to decrease the price to the farmer whose crop could not be so moved and to decrease the price . in the open ' market . Mr. Hoover owes it to himself and to the public to explain his statement . Mr. Hoover , having thus raised the market price of the farmer 's crop by reducing the cost of moving the crop to market , proceeds to increase the revenue of the railways /Thr depriving them of an important item of their freight business . He says : " Nor does this development mean the crippling of our railways . The annual increase in railway traffic will give to them a far more and complete offset to these diversions . Moreover , everything that increases the prosperity of the country also helps the railways . " Is it possible that Mr. Hoover is given to exaggeration and rash statement ? The railways might not be crippled by the diversion , but it would be a serious loss to them , and it would be none the less a loss because they have other lines of business that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity of the country helps the railways . ? Diversion of freight , as in the case he is speaking of , increases the prosperity of the country but does not help the railways . The diversion of which he speaks , for the present affects only a part of the crop . If successful , it would , no doubt , be extended to include more or all of the crop and to include other merchandise . Development of motor trucks , bus lines , airplanes and dirigibles promises still other diversions . The results may mean great prosperity to the country , but will not help the railways . Mr. Hoover is a trained engineer , he has held the office of Secretary of Commerce , and the subject of market prices and railway transportation ought to be familiar to him , and yet I think it would be hard to find in the public utterances of any aspirant to high . office of this generation two statements more flatly at variance with sound ? reason and common sense .
