Having delivered himself of opinions upon the Bible ( " a bloody book " ) , upon the many cases of substitution to be found in the streets of St. Louis ( " I can show you a thousand " ) , and upon an enormous number of other topics* , famed evangelist and onetime baseball player Billy Sunday last week prepared to conclude his seven-week revival meeting in the city which was once perfumed by the aroma of Anheuser-Busch or other famed brands of beer . <P> He spoke , in a last sermon , of prayer : " God always answers prayer-'Yes . ' ' No . ' ' Wait . ' - but He always answers . . . . " <P> Of piety : " Going to church does n't make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile . . . . " <P> In another sermon he described the scene which would take place when he arrived in Heaven . First he will shake hands with Jesus and thank Him for coming to the world and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , will then say , in case his " hunch " bears fruit and he dies before Mrs. Sunday : " I left Nell and the children down there on earth and I 'd like to hang around the gate here to meet them . " Jesus , Mr. Sunday thought , would reply in these terms : " All right , Bill , just sit down there . They 'll come right through here . . . . There 's the biggest bunch from St. Louis you ever saw . " <P> Evangelist Sunday made another prophecy , anent his stop in St. Louis . " We 'll talk about the campaign we held here for millions of years . " he said . With parables and epigrams he summarized the serious topic of his sermon , Eternal Life : " Man tries to whitewash himself when God wants to wash him white . . . . Do n't let God hang a ' For Rent ' sign in the mansion he 's prepared for you . . . . It 's up to you . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In his very last sermon , Billy Sunday again referred to his seven week revival meeting . " As long as you live you 'll never see another meeting like this one . . . . " This last sermon had a text , taken from Exodus VIII. , 10 : " And he said ' Tomorrow . ' " Billy Sunday said : " Tomorrow-that 's the soft lounge on which multitudes lie down to be lulled into an eternal sleep . " <P> " The next time you come in here you 'll see my face and hear my voice in your imagination . You will note this spot where the platform stood and you will imagine me standing here . Say , Jesus , I 'm through in St. Louis . Though I never walk the streets of St. Louis again in the flesh , I shall walk them in the spirit . Often in spirit I shall come to the Locust street entrance of the Coliseum , where those fine policemen have met me for seven weeks . . . . " Billy Sunday reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a trap door in the stage . <P> It had been a highly successful revival meeting . Mr. Sunday had made 7,049 converts and $20,671 . Of the latter figure he remarked , " I was in debt $17,000 . Now I 'm going to get out of the hole . "
