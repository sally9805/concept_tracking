txt Italians and Schneider Cup Race . There appeared In Tile NEW Tong TIMES In the Sunday edition of July 31 an article which severely criticized the attitude of the Italians toward the postponement of the coming Schneider Cup race scheduled to be held , In Venice beginning Sept. 23 . I am writing this letter to Inform you that the attitude attributed to the Italians is entirely incorrect . The Italians and their representatives in this country have acted in a most sportsmanlike way , and instead of opposing the postponement of the race . as requested by the National Aeronautic Association on behalf- of Lieutenant Williams , are doing and have done everything they could to effect the postponement . It is unfortunate that tire cordial relations that we have had with the representatives of the Italians and with the racing team which was in this country last Autumn should be in any way marred by charges of unsportsmanlike conduct , and I would appreciate it if you would publish this letter to controvert as far as possible the erroneous and unjust impression which may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.
