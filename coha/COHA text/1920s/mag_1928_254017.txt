Because aeronautical engineers are at the very front of motor development , Lester J. Hendershot , young Pittsburgh civil engineer working for the U. S. Topographical Survey , secretly presented his new type electric motor to such men at Pittsburgh , Detroit and Manhattan last week . Without any connection to any apparent power store , the machine ran for hours . The energy came , said the inventor , from the electricity accumulated by the earth in its daily and yearly rotations .
