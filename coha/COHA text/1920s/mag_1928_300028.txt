Smart folk motoring down to Biarritz , at the close of Deauville 's " fortnight , " had two droll little incidents to tell about . <P> A young woman rose very pale from the baccarat table at Deauville Casino . She swayed and seemed about to faint , then her eyes fixed on a swarthy , paunchy Indian , His Highness the Aga Khan . As though impelled by hypnosis she took a step toward the Khan . <P> " I 've just lost my last sou , " she said a little huskily , " how does Your Highness always , always win ? " <P> The Aga Khan is a descendant of the True Prophet , and a gallant gentleman . " Take this , Ma'm'selle , " he said , handing her a huge oblong chip . " I make only one condition . You must never play baccarat again . " <P> In a still more hypnotic state , Ma'm'selle moved dazedly to the cashier 's window , cashed the chip for its stamped value of 100,000 francs ( $4,000 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other drollery , trivial , befell Actress Yvette Laurent when she strolled into a Deauville bar and sang out cheerily to a middle-aged man , " How about a little drink ? " <P> ( Yvette later explained , " Of course I would never have dreamed of doing such a thing in Paris ! ) <P> " Charming , " said the middle-aged man , " Champagne ? " <P> " What 's your name ? " brightened Yvette . <P> " Dreyfuss . " <P> Some 30 minutes later an equerry entered and addressed the middle-aged man as " Highness . " <P> " Say Dreyfuss , " gulped Mile . Laurent , " who are you anyway ? " but Dreyfuss offered an excuse , kissed her hand , was gone . <P> " Dreyfuss , " as the Bar Man told Yvette , was His Royal Highness , Prince Aage of Denmark , cousin of King Christian X. <P> H. R. H. is chiefly celebrated for his immortal and exact definition of the taste of Montmartre boite de nuite ( night club ) champagne . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusty windowpane.
