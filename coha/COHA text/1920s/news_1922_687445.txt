txt Aroused by the ' action of two juries in General Sessions in acquitting men in spite of an apparently overwhelming weight of evidence against them and the declaration of six talesmen called for another trial that they would not accept the testimony of policemen and police witnesses against the defendant , Judge Alfred J. Talley issued a statement yesterday in which he declared that the conduct of the jurors " was a manifestation of the Bolshevik spirit . " " Recent developments , I think , are due to something comparable with the spirit of lawlessness and revolt against authority and government that has manifested Itself among criminals in crime outbreaks , " he added , " and is indicated among persons not criminals but who are adverse to supporting organized government by putting down lawlessness and lawbreakers . " Judge Talley 's statement followed the action of Judge Francis X. Mancuso the night before when he described the verdict of a jury which had acquitted a man on a hold-up charge as " disgraceful . " Judge Mancuso 's remarks were in line with sentiments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Talley and Judge Rosalsky . Evidence at Hold-Up Trial . Judge Mancuso had presided for two weeks at the trial of George Carmichael , 21 , of 201 East 115th Street , in connection with the theft of $16,500 in money and jewelry from Samuel Richman , a jewelry salesman , of 519 Lincoln Place , Brooklyn , and Frank Cohen of 2,015 Sixty-sixth Street , Brooklyn , in an apartment at 352 Manhattan Avenue on the night of Nov. 1 , last . Richman and Cohen said they had been decoyed to the apartment by a taxicab chauffeur , who drove up to them while they were standing at Sixth Avenue and Forty-second Street . They testified that when they reached the apartment they were held up with pistols by Carmichael and Tony Lasandro , and that Samuel Castrillo , the taxicab chauffour , of 108 East 121st Street , aided in the robbery . They also testified that after the robbery the three men locked them in the apartment . Detectives Boyle , Donohue and Shields of the West 123d Street station , who arrested the three men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They added that admissions made by Carmichael led to the arrest of the taxicab chauffeur and the discovery that Lasandro had been slain . They said that they had information which indicated that the killing was the result of a fight over tile division of the spoils . Cuff Links identified . Assistant District Attorney Winter Russell during the testimony of the detectives brought out what he considered the strongest evidence against Carmichael . They testified that when they arrested him they found on him a sapphire pin and a pair of diamond cuff links , which Richman declared were part of the loot obtained from him in the robbery . Mr. Russell then placed on the witness stand a jewelry manufacturer , who identified the cuff links as having been made by him . Another witness called by the prosecutor identified the sapphire pin as having been in Richman 's possession , explaining that he had cut the stone for the pin . - Carmichael took the stand in his own defense and swore that the cuff links and the pin had been In his passession for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A woman testified that she had given the cuff links to him , and said she had bought them in Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , for $30 . The manufacturer had testified that their Ishblesale price was $55 , When Hyman Kevelson , foreman of the jury , of 745 Riverside Drive , announced the verdict of acquittal in the case , Judge Mancuso expressed surprise . The jury had had the evidence under advisement less than forty-five minutes . Judge Mancuso said : " I supp6se that in the future jurors will want the District Attorney to place before them as evidenea a moving picture of the crime . It is hard for a Judge to_the sit here and receive such a disgraceful ' verdict , particulzrly at this time , when there are so mrny hold-ups in-the city , " Wheeling around In his chair and facing the jurors , Judge Mancuso added : " You are excused from further attendance in this court . I shall direct- the Commissioner of Jurors to strike your names from the jury list . " On the preceding day Judge Rosalsky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stating , when Called as jurors In another hold-up case that they would not believe policemen or detectives called as witnesses . In announcing that he would cause their names to be dropped from the jury list he added : I have found that ninety-nine out of one hundred policemen are honest , truthful , law-abiding men , and that they display more interest in the welfare of the community , even outside of their official positions , than the average man . Many of them have given their lives and have died heroic deaths in the performance of their duties . " Would n't Believe Policemen . Judge Talley criticized a jury last Thursday for acquitting a man accused of a burglary charge after two policemen had testified they caught the man and another in the act of robbing a store . The policemen also stated that the prisoner offered them $105 for his release when they were taking him to the station . The jurors admitted that they did not believe the testimony of the policemen , although the other man involved was convicted by another jury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for trial of criminal cases , Judge Talley added : " It is due in part to the varied and complex conditions of present-day civilization ? a lack of appreciation of ideals and standards of good citizenship . Apparently violations of law and the commission of crimes are not regarded today by many persons as seriously as they were looked upon two or three years ago . " Practically every man called for jury duty nowadays is willing to violate the prohibition law . He knows all his friends are willing to do the same thing . That in itself is the breaking down in one spot , at least , of the respect for the law which every citizen should have . Once that respect for the law is shattered a breakdown all along the line is not extraprdinary . Against Jury Exemptions . " Present-day jury material is unsatisfactory . Two things contribute to this . First , the law which permits exemption to about nineteen classes of citizens , including doctors , clergymen , teachers , newspaper men and paid poll clerks at elections . All exemptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve . Whether any person is excused from jury duty should rest with the discretibn of the Judge There is no more reason for excusing classes from jury duty than for excusing classes from allegiance to the Government . " A second remedy rests with the Judge themselves . There is too much laxity in excusing 3urors . If all the Judges of the Supreme Court and General Sessions would agree to excuse no juror except for disability , jurors who up . to the present have been able to get excused , would be compelled to serve . " District Attorney Joab H. Banton also came to the defense of policemen as witnesses in criminal trials . " I have found that testimony by members of the force is the most reliable kind of testimony , " he said . " What reason has a policeman to testify falsely ? " he asked . It was said that the Judges of General Sessions , because of the action of the jurors in the three cases , would hold a meeting during the coming week to discuss the matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Talley 's suggestion that no juror be excused from duty unless on the score of disability . It was also reported that the Judges will endeavoi ? to work out a plan whereby only the most intelligent type of juror will be accepted for duty in the trials of important cases .
