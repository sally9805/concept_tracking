Andrew William Mellon last week advised investors to purchase bonds rather than stocks . Reason : the bond market is " not particularly good " ; many a bond is low in price , high in interest . Some stocks . he said , were too high to be good investments and it was easier to pick out a good bond than a good stock . <P> Mr. Mellon 's homily on what every investor knows had an immediately bullish effect on stocks rather than bonds . Reason : low money rates make bonds attractive ; but low money rates also make it easier to borrow money with which to speculate in stocks . The Mellon statement was taken to mean that money rates would not fly too high , which is about the only fear in the hearts of current bulls . Roy A. Young , Governor of the Federal Reserve Board , said that though the Federal Reserve system might " be compelled in the end to resort to higher rediscount rates , " it should first " use every other effort " to reduce inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will slump from 15% to 25% before Labor Day .
