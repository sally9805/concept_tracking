" Stand by for boarding by government agents ! " <P> Boatswain James R. Ingraham , commanding a Coast Guard picket boat , shouted through the gloom of an early Florida morning last week at a fast little craft he had spotted on Biscayne Bay . " All right , " came back a faint reply , but the boat , instead , went shooting off up Miami River . <P> The picket boat pursued . Boatswain Ingraham turned to Fireman 's Mate Harold Lopes . " Fire a few shots across her bow , " he ordered . " Aim at the superstructure of the new bridge across the river . " <P> With his automatic revolver , Lopes fired . The quarry sped on . Then , on Ingraham 's order , Machinist Samuel Jones opened machine-gun-fire from the picket boat 's bow . Some 200 bullets whined through the dark . These random shots did not stop the runaway but they : 1 ) startled Mrs. Robert V. Latham , sitting up in bed aboard her husband 's houseboat , one shot missing her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broughman , night watchman along the river ; 3 ) penetrated the " parlors " of Undertaker John Gautier ; 4 ) lodged in two houses on Miami 's Flagler St. ; 5 ) aroused hundreds of Miami sleepers ; 7 ) stirred Miami 's City Commission to consider a formal protest to Washington . <P> Fortunately for the Coast Guard , the pursued craft , found stranded and abandoned up the river , was a real rumrunner . Even so , the reckless rattle of Coast Guard bullets stirred afresh the anxiety of many a law-abiding yachtsman who had experienced the service 's quick gunfire , its brusque raids , its salty backtalk . Protest after protest against officious bedevilment has been sent to the Coast Guard 's squat red-brick headquarters in Washington . Invariably the Service has upheld its men for doing their duty . <P> Yachtsmen cite typical cases : <P> Jones . A prominent member of the coal business nowadays is " Tad " Jones . The public knows him better as the old-time coach of Yale football teams . Mr. Jones used to welcome to Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that professionally , and for his private yacht , the T. A. D. Jones , sturdy collier . Last week , off the New Jersey coast , the T. A. D. Jones was fired on , stopped by the U. S. Coast Guard cutter Seneca . <P> The Seneca searchers found no liquor . Mr. Jones grimly promised to complain to Washington . <P> Matheson . A bright sun was shining across Biscayne Bay in Florida one day last February as William John Matheson , retired chemical tycoon , sat on his Coconut Grove porch and watched one of his white high-sided launches return with indignant house guests from Key Biscayne six miles away . Close behind came a black speed launch in charge of Coast Guardsmen . A rough sea was running . Spray curtains had been in place . The guardsmen had fired five rifle shots at the Matheson boat to stop it . <P> Mr. Matheson filed a protest with Congresswoman Ruth Bryan Owen who took up the matter with Rear-Admiral Frederick C. Billard , Coast Guard commandant at Washington . Wrote Admiral Billard to Tycoon Matheson : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret . . . but . . . the Coast Guard personnel involved are not censurable in this incident . "
