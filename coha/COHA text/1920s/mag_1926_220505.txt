The Blonde Sinner . A sleazy combination of musical comedy , mystery play , and Long Island society drama was injected last week and did n't take . The golden girl of the title falls into the web of a divorce suit as unidentified correspondent . Detectives and others interested assemble at her summer home . Moments of violent sleuthing are followed by moments in which the cast strive to act exclusive . Then there is a song and dance to confuse the spectator further . Of all of this the songs were best . The rest was indolent ; a crude entertainment .
