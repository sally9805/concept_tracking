The Norris Constitutional Amendment , which would advance the date of inauguration of the President and seating of Congress , gained strength in the House , but its passage is not conceded in this session . The measure , which passed the Senate by odds of more than 10 to 1 , is aimed at the ubiquitous " lame duck " Congressman , who , defeated and repudiated by his constituency , continues long afterward to wreak his will upon legislation . It provides that the President and Vice President shall take office the third Monday in January and that Congress shall be seated the first Monday in January instead of March , 4.
