The Rt . Rev. Thomas James Garland , Bishop of the Episcopal diocese of Philadelphia , is a shrewd , hard worker , not without a sense of humor . Born in Ireland , he has lived in Pennsylvania more than a quarter-century . His long toil in the vineyard has thinned and dried him . His diocese is wealthy . <P> Last week Bishop Garland had this statement to make : " They all seem to be afraid of hard work . It rather amuses me . I have borne the burden of the work here for the past six years . I am 62 and they are all younger men than I. The diocese has not lost standing . I am still Pennsylvanian enough to say if they have refused , let them refuse . ' ' ' <P> The bishop was talking about four men to whom he had unsuccessfully offered the position of Bishop Coadjutor . <P> The Rev. Dr. Henry Knox Sherrill , rector of Trinity Church , Boston , was Bishop Garland 's first choice . A graduate of Yale , aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the War he was an A. E. F. chaplain . Offered the Philadelphia position last May , Dr. Sherrill graciously explained that he preferred to stay in Boston . <P> Second was the Bishop of Spokane , the Rt . Rev. Edward Makin Cross , tall , slender and grey-eyed . Last week he was 49 . Bishop Cross sent his regrets to Philadelphia because-he preferred to remain in Spokane . <P> Third was Dr. Russell Bowie , rector of Grace Church , Manhattan . Smooth-faced , brown-eyed , athletic , this churchman , too , seemed to prefer the diocese in which he found himself , and declined . <P> Fourth and last was Dean William Scarlett of Christ Church Cathedral , St. Louis . He , having considered the offered post for more than a month , followed what seemed to have become a precedent . His regrets to Bishop Garland were published last fortnight . <P> It was perhaps no wonder that Bishop Garland was vexed by such persistent bad luck , but it seemed hardly fair to charge the four decliners with fear of hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop coadjutor helps a bishop and succeeds to his position after his death , retirement or removal from office . Herein he differs from a bishop suffragan who also helps a bishop but does not necessarily succeed him . The yearly salary of the Philadelphia bishop coadjutor is $10,000 , plus $2,500 for maintenance of a house . <P> Inevitable was the parallel between Bishop Garland and Bishop William Thomas Manning of New York . Both are bishops of wealthy Eastern dioceses . Both have had troubles , recently , in managing their churches . The Manning troubles centered about the resignation of Dean Howard Chandler Robbins ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) . Many Robbins-supporters believe that the Dean resigned because Bishop Manning , with whose high-church views Dean Robbins did not entirely hold , was " autocratic . " Bishop Garland in Philadelphia is not " high church . " But last week , many a Philadelphian , pondering the parallel , wondered if it was not a fear of " autocracy " that was keeping potential young coadjutors away from Philadelphia .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
