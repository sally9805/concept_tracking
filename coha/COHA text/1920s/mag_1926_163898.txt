" I feel very happy about the entirely new spirit that has come with the abolition of compulsion . In the recent past , daily services were worse than a joke-blasphemy under the name of religion . The men would cough , read books and magazines and talk with one another . Even during the Sunday services . . . there was always the feeling that the lid might blow off at any time . . . . I would rather have 50 interested men coming here willingly than 1,500 coming because they have to and sitting through the services mad . " Thus Rev. Roy B. Chamberlain , writing last week in the Boston Herald upon the effect of a ruling ( TIME , Oct. 19 ) that relieved undergraduates of compulsion to attend services in the chapel of Dartmouth College , of which the Rev. Mr. Chamberlain is director .
